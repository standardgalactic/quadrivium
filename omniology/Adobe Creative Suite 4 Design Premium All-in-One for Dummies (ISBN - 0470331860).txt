Introduction
A
dobe software has always been highly respected for creative design 
and development. Adobe creates programs that allow you to produce 
amazing designs and creations with ease. The Adobe Creative Suite 4 
(CS4) Design Premium is the company’s latest release of sophisticated and 
professional-level software that bundles many separate programs together 
as a suite. Each program in the suite works individually, or you can integrate 
the programs together by using Version Cue, Adobe’s work management 
software that helps keep track of revisions and edits, and Adobe Bridge, 
an independent program that helps you control file management with 
thumbnails, metadata, and other organizational tools.
You can use the Adobe CS4 Design Premium programs to create a wide 
range of products, from illustrations, page layouts, and professional 
documents, to Web sites and photographic manipulations. Integrating the 
CS4 programs extends your possibilities as a designer. Don’t worry about 
the programs being too difficult to figure out — just come up with your 
ideas and start creating!
About This Book
Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium All-in-One For Dummies is written 
in a thorough and fun way to show you the basics on how to use each 
of the programs included in the suite. You find out how to use each program 
individually and how to work with the programs together, letting you extend 
your projects even further. You find out just how easy it is to use the 
programs through simple steps so that you can discover the power of the 
Adobe software. You’ll be up and running in no time!
Here are some things you can do with this book:
 
✦ Create page layouts using text, drawings, and images in InDesign.
 
✦ Make illustrations using drawing tools with Illustrator.
 
✦ Manipulate photographs using filters and drawing or color correction 
tools with Photoshop.
 
✦ Create PDF (Portable Document Format) documents with Adobe 
Acrobat or other programs.
 
✦ Create Web pages and put them online with Dreamweaver.
 
✦ Create animations and videos with Flash.
 
✦ Create Web images, rollovers, image maps, and slices with Fireworks.

Foolish Assumptions
2
You discover the basics of how to create all these different kinds of things 
throughout the chapters in this book in fun, hands-on examples and clear 
explanations, getting you up to speed quickly!
Foolish Assumptions
You don’t need to know much before picking up this book and getting 
started with the Design Premium suite. All you have to know is how to use a 
computer in a very basic way. If you can turn on the computer and use a 
mouse, you’re ready for this book. A bit of knowledge about basic computer 
operations and using software helps, but it isn’t necessary. We show you 
how to open, save, create, and manipulate files using the CS4 programs so 
that you can start working with the programs quickly. The most important 
ingredient to have is your imagination and creativity — we show you how to 
get started with the rest.
Conventions Used in This Book
Adobe CS4 Design Premium is available for both Windows and the 
Macintosh. We cover both platforms in this book. Where the keys you need 
to press or the menu choice you need to make differs between Windows and 
the Mac, we let you know by including instructions for both platforms. For 
example:
 
✦ Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key.
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (Windows) or InDesign➪
Preferences➪General (Mac).
The programs in Design Premium Suite often require you to press and hold 
down a key (or keys) on the keyboard and then click or drag with the mouse. 
For brevity’s sake, we shorten this action by naming the key you need to 
hold down and adding click or drag, as follows:
 
✦ Shift-click to select multiple files.
 
✦ Move the object by Ctrl-dragging (Windows) or Ô-dragging (Mac).
Here are the formatting conventions used in this book:
 
✦ Bold: We use bold to indicate when you should type something or to 
highlight an action in a step list. For example, the action required to 
open a dialog box would appear in bold in a step list.
 
✦ Code font: We use this computerese font to show you Web addresses 
(URLs), e-mail addresses, or bits of HTML code. For example, you’d type 
a URL into a browser window to access a Web page, such as www.
google.com.

✦ Italics: We use italics to highlight a new term, which we then define. For 
example, filters may be a new term to you. The word itself is italicized 
and is followed by a definition to explain what the word means.
What You Don’t Have to Read
This book is pretty thick; you may wonder whether you have to read it 
from cover to cover. You don’t have to read every page of this book to 
discover how to use the programs in the Design Premium Suite. Luckily, 
you can choose bits and pieces that mean the most to you and will help 
you finish a project you may be working on. Perhaps you’re interested in 
creating a technical drawing and putting it online. You can choose to read 
a couple chapters in Book III on Illustrator and then skip ahead to Book VI 
on Dreamweaver and just read the relevant chapters or sections on each 
subject. Later, you may want to place some associated PDF documents 
online, so read a few chapters in Book V on Acrobat or Book II on exporting 
InDesign documents. Find out how to create animations for the Web and 
video in Book VII covering Flash.
You don’t have to read everything on each page, either. You can treat many 
of the icons in this book as bonus material. Icons supplement the material 
in each chapter with additional information that may interest or help you 
with your work. The Technical Stuff icons are great if you want to find out 
a bit more about technical aspects of using the program or your computer, 
but don’t feel that you need to read these icons if technicalities don’t 
interest you.
How This Book Is Organized
Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium All-in-One For Dummies is split into 
eight quick-reference guides, or minibooks. You don’t have to read these 
minibooks sequentially, and you don’t even have to read all the sections in 
any particular chapter. You can use the Table of Contents and the index to 
find the information you need and quickly get your answer. In this section, 
we briefly describe what you find in each minibook.
Book I: Adobe Creative Suite 4 Basics
Book I shows you how to use the features in Design Premium programs that 
are similar across all the programs described in this book. You discover the 
menus, panels, and tools that are similar or work the same way in most of 
the CS4 programs. You also find out how to import, export, and use common 
commands in each program. If you’re wondering about what shortcuts and 
common tools you can use in the programs to speed up your workflow, this 
part has tips and tricks you’ll find quite useful. The similarities in all the pro-
grams are helpful because they make using the programs that much easier.

Book II: InDesign CS4
Book II describes how to use InDesign CS4 to create simple page layouts 
with text, images, and drawings. Hands-on steps show you how to use the 
drawing tools in InDesign to create illustrations and also use other menus 
and tools to add text and pictures. Importing stories and illustrations into 
InDesign is an important part of the process, so you find out how this task is 
done effectively as well. Book II shows you how easy it is to create effective 
page layouts with this powerful and professional design program.
Book III: Illustrator CS4
Book III starts with the fundamentals of Adobe Illustrator CS4 to help you 
create useful and interesting illustrations. Check out this minibook to 
discover how to take advantage of features that have been around for many 
versions of Illustrator, such as the Pen tool, as well as new and exciting fea-
tures, such as vector tracing. See how to take advantage of the Appearance 
panel and save time by creating graphic styles, templates, and symbols. 
Pick up hard-to-find keyboard shortcuts that can help reduce the time spent 
mousing around for menu items and tools.
Book IV: Photoshop CS4
Book IV on Photoshop CS4 is aimed to help you achieve good imagery, 
starting with basics that even advanced users may have missed along the 
way. In this minibook, you find out how to color correct images like a pro 
and use tools to keep images at the right resolution and size, no matter 
whether the image is intended for print or the Web.
This minibook also shows you how to integrate new features in Photoshop, 
such as the new Adjustments panel and Masks panel, as well as inform you 
of the new 3D tools. By the time you’re finished with this minibook, you’ll 
feel like you can perform magic on just about any image.
Book V: Acrobat 9.0
Adobe Acrobat 9.0 is a powerful viewing and editing program that allows you 
to share documents with colleagues, clients, and production personnel, such 
as printers and Web-page designers. Book V shows you how you can save 
time and money previously spent on couriers and overnight shipping by 
taking advantage of annotation capabilities. Discover features that even 
advanced users may have missed along the way and see how you can feel 
comfortable about using PDF as a file format of choice.
Book VI: Dreamweaver CS4
Book VI shows you how creating a Web site in Dreamweaver CS4 can be easy 
and fun. Take advantage of the tools and features in Dreamweaver to make 
and maintain a very clean and usable site. Discover how to take advantage

of improved Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) capabilities, as well as exciting 
rollover and action features that add interactivity to your site. In the past, 
these functions required lots of hand-coding and tape on the glasses, but 
now you can be a designer and create interactivity easily in Dreamweaver — 
no hand-coding or pocket protectors required.
Book VII: Flash CS4
Find out how to create interactive animations for the Web and video with 
Flash CS4. Start with the basics, such as creating simple animations with 
tweening, all the way up to animations that allow for user interaction. This 
Timeline-based program may be different than anything that you’ve ever 
worked with, but Flash is sure to be an exciting program to discover.
Book VIII: Fireworks CS4
As the newest addition to the suite, Fireworks CS4 offers you the capabilities 
you need to create virtually any sort of Web graphic. With Fireworks, you 
can optimize (prepare for the Web) images and graphics, as well as create 
cool rollover effects and sliced graphics. Find out in Book VIII how to spice 
up your Web site with buttons, image maps, and more!
Icons Used in This Book
What’s a For Dummies book without icons pointing you in the direction 
of really great information that’s sure to help you along your way? In this 
section, we briefly describe each icon we use in this book.
 
The Tip icon points out helpful information that is likely to make your 
job easier.
 
This icon marks a generally interesting and useful fact — something that you 
may want to remember for later use.
 
The Warning icon highlights lurking danger. With this icon, we’re telling you 
to pay attention and proceed with caution.
 
When you see this icon, you know that there’s techie stuff nearby. If you’re 
not feeling very technical, you can skip this info.

You can use the Adobe CS4 programs together in many different and helpful 
ways to make your workflow more efficient. Throughout this book, we 
explain just how you can implement integration wherever it’s pertinent 
to the discussion at hand. We highlight these tidbits with the Integration 
icon — you won’t want to miss this information.
Where to Go from Here
Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium All-in-One For Dummies is designed 
so that you can read a chapter or section out of order, depending on 
what subjects you’re most interested in. Where you go from here is entirely 
up to you!
Book I is a great place to start reading if you’ve never used Adobe products 
or if you’re new to design-based software. Discovering the common 
terminology, menus, and panels can be very helpful for the later chapters 
that use the terms and commands regularly!

ith the Adobe Creative Suite 4 (CS4) Design Premium release, you 
not only get the tools you need to be creative for print and Web, but 
you also get Adobe Fireworks to make Web sites more attractive than ever.
The diverse software in Adobe CS4 Design Premium enables you to create 
everything from an interactive e-commerce Web site to a printed book. Each 
piece of software in the Adobe Creative Suite works on its own as a robust 
tool. Combine all the applications, including Adobe Bridge, and you have a 
dynamic workflow that just can’t be matched.
In this minibook, you discover the many features that are consistent among 
the applications in the suite. You find consistencies in color, file formats, 
and text editing, as well as general preferences for rulers and guides 
throughout all the applications in CS4. This minibook also shows you where 
to find the new features and how to save time by taking advantage of them.
In this chapter, you meet each of the components in Adobe CS4 Design 
Premium and discover what you can create with each of these powerful tools.

Introducing InDesign CS4

Introducing InDesign CS4
InDesign is a diverse and feature-rich page layout program. With InDesign, 
you can create beautifully laid-out page designs. You can also execute com-
plete control over your images and export to interactive documents, such as 
Acrobat PDF. InDesign allows you to accomplish the following:
 
✦ Use images, text, and even rich media to create unique layouts and 
designs.
 
✦ Import native files from Photoshop and Illustrator to help build rich 
layouts in InDesign that take advantage of transparency and blending 
modes.
 
✦ Export your work as an entire book, including chapters, sections, auto-
matically numbered pages, and more.
 
✦ Create interactive PDF documents.
 
✦ Create drawings with the basic drawing tools included in the software.
InDesign caters to the layout professional, but it’s easy enough for even 
beginners to use. You can import text from word processing programs (such 
as Microsoft Word, Notepad, or Adobe InCopy) as well as tables (say, from 
Microsoft Excel) into your documents and place them alongside existing 
artwork and images to create a layout. In a nutshell, importing, arranging, 
and exporting work is a common process when working with InDesign. 
Throughout this entire process, you have a large amount of control over 
your work, whether you’re working on a simple one-page brochure or an 
entire book of 800+ pages.
For those of you already using InDesign, read Book II, Chapter 1 to find out 
about some of the new features in CS4, which include new Flash integration 
features, an incredible Links panel, and image placement options that save 
you lots of time.
Using Illustrator CS4
Adobe Illustrator is the industry’s leading vector-based graphics software. 
Aimed at everyone from graphics professionals to Web users, Illustrator 
allows you to design layouts, logos for print, or vector-based images that 
can be imported into other programs, such as Photoshop, InDesign, or 
even Flash. Adobe also enables you to easily and quickly create files by 
saving Illustrator documents as templates (so that you can efficiently reuse 
designs) and using a predefined library and document size.
Illustrator also integrates with the other products in the Adobe Creative 
Suite by allowing you to create PDF documents easily within Illustrator. In

addition, you can use Illustrator files in Photoshop, InDesign, and Adobe’s 
special effects program, After Effects. Illustrator allows you to beef up your 
rich interactive documents by introducing Flash features that give you the 
tools you need to build exciting interactive designs in Flash.
Here are some of the things you can create and do in Illustrator:
 
✦ Create technical drawings (floor plans, architectural sketches, and so 
on), logos, illustrations, posters, packaging, and Web graphics.
 
✦ Add effects, such as drop shadows and Gaussian blurs, to vector images.
 
✦ Enhance artwork by creating your own custom brushes.
 
✦ Align text along a path so that it bends in an interesting way.
 
✦ Lay out text into multicolumn brochures — text automatically flows 
from one column to the next.
 
✦ Create charts and graphs using graphing tools.
 
✦ Create gradients that can be imported and edited in other programs, 
such as InDesign.
 
✦ Create documents quickly and easily using the existing templates and 
included stock graphics in Illustrator.
 
✦ Save a drawing in almost any graphic format, including Adobe’s PDF, 
PSD, EPS, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, and SVG formats.
 
✦ Save your Illustrator files for the Web by using the Save for Web & 
Devices dialog box, which allows you to output HTML, GIF, and JPEG.
 
✦ Save Illustrator files as secure PDF files with 128-bit encryption.
 
✦ Export assets as symbols to Flash.
There are many new features for you to investigate, many of them inte-
grated in the chapters in Book III. Find out about new tools, including the 
improved Appearance panel, guides that help you work more accurately, 
and improved isolation features that help you focus on your artwork, quickly 
and easily. Find additional features by reading Book III, Chapter 1.
Getting Started with Photoshop CS4
Photoshop is the industry-standard software for Web designers, video 
professionals, and photographers who need to manipulate bitmap images. 
Photoshop allows you to manage and edit images by correcting color, 
editing photos by hand, and even combining several photos together to 
create interesting and unique effects. Alternatively, you can use Photoshop 
as a painting program, where you can artistically create images and graph-
ics. Photoshop even includes a file browser that lets you easily manage your 

Working with Acrobat 9.0
12
images by assigning keywords or allowing you to search the images based 
on metadata.
Photoshop allows you to create complex text layouts by placing text along 
a path or within shapes. You can edit the text after it’s been placed along a 
path; you can even edit the text in other programs, such as Illustrator CS4. 
Join text and images together into unique designs or page layouts.
Sharing images from Photoshop is very easy to do. You can share multiple 
images in a PDF file, create an attractive photo gallery for the Web with a few 
clicks of the mouse, or upload images to an online photo service. You can pre-
view multiple filters (effects) at once without having to apply each filter sepa-
rately. Photoshop CS4 also supports various artistic brush styles, such as wet 
and dry brush type effects and charcoal and pastel effects. Photoshop also 
has some great features for scanning. You can scan multiple images at once, 
and Photoshop can straighten each photo and save it as an individual file.
It’s hard to believe that Photoshop can be improved upon, but Adobe has 
done it again in Adobe Photoshop CS4. Find these new features and many 
more in Book IV.
There’s much more to see in Photoshop CS4. Book IV shows you the diverse 
capabilities of Photoshop. From drawing and painting to image color correc-
tion, Photoshop has many uses for print and Web design alike. Read Book IV, 
Chapter 1 to discover all the new features in Photoshop CS4, including new 
and improved adjustment layers and new 3D tools and features.
Working with Acrobat 9.0
Acrobat 9.0 Professional is aimed at both business and creative profession-
als, and provides an incredibly useful way of sharing, security, and reviewing 
the documents you create in your Design Premium Suite applications.
Portable Document Format (PDF) is the file format used by Adobe Acrobat. 
It’s used primarily as an independent method for sharing files. This format 
allows users who create files on either Macintosh or PC systems to share 
files with each other, and with users of handheld devices or UNIX comput-
ers. PDF files generally start out as other documents — whether from a word 
processor or a sophisticated page layout and design program.
Although PDF files can be read on many different computer systems using 
the free Adobe Reader, users with the Professional or Standard version 
of Adobe Acrobat can do much more with PDF files. With your version of 
Acrobat, you can create PDF documents, add security to them, use review 
and commenting tools, edit the documents, and build PDF forms.

Book I

Use Acrobat to perform any of the following tasks:
 
✦ Create interactive forms that can be filled out online.
 
✦ Allow users to embed comments within the PDF files to provide feedback. 
Comments can then be compiled from multiple reviewers and viewed in 
a single summary.
 
✦ Create PDF files that can include MP3 audio, video, SWF, and even 3D 
files.
 
✦ Combine multiple files into a single PDF and include headers and 
footers, as well as watermarks.
 
✦ Create secure documents with encryption.
 
✦ Take advantage of a new, intuitive user interface. You can now complete 
tasks more quickly with a streamlined user interface, new customizable 
toolbars, and a Getting Started page to visually direct you to commonly 
used features. In other words, you get an interface more in line with 
what you may see in the rest of the Creative Suite products.
 
✦ Combine multiple files into a searchable, sortable PDF package that 
maintains the individual security settings and digital signatures of each 
included PDF document.
 
✦ Use auto-recognize to automatically locate form fields in static PDF 
documents and convert them to interactive fields that can be filled elec-
tronically by anyone using Adobe Reader software (Windows only).
 
✦ Manage shared reviews — without IT assistance — to allow review 
participants to see one another’s comments and track the status of the 
review. Shared reviews are possible through Acrobat Connect, formerly 
Breeze.
 
✦ Enable advanced features in Adobe Reader to enable anyone using free 
Adobe Reader software to participate in document reviews, fill and save 
electronic forms offline, and digitally sign documents.
 
✦ Permanently remove metadata, hidden layers, and other concealed 
information and use redaction tools to permanently delete sensitive 
text, illustrations, or other content.
 
✦ Save your PDF to Microsoft Word. This feature is a treasure! You can 
now take advantage of improved functionality for saving Adobe PDF 
files as Microsoft Word documents, retaining the layout, fonts, format-
ting, and tables.
 
✦ Enjoy improved performance and support for AutoCAD. Those of you 
using AutoCAD can now more rapidly convert AutoCAD drawing files 
into compact, accurate PDF documents, without the need for the native 
desktop application.

out all about Acrobat and PDF creation.
Introducing Dreamweaver CS4
Dreamweaver CS4 is used to create professional Web sites quickly and effi-
ciently, without the need to know or understand HTML (HyperText Markup 
Language). You can work with a visual authoring workspace (commonly 
known as a Design view), or you can work in an environment where you work 
with the code. Dreamweaver enables you to set up entire Web sites of multiple 
pages on your hard drive, test them, and then upload them to a Web server. 
With Dreamweaver’s integration capabilities, you can create pages easily that 
contain imagery from Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Flash.
Dreamweaver also has built-in support for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). 
CSS is a language that allows you to format your Web pages and control text 
attributes, such as color, size, and style of text. CSS gives you control over 
the layout of the elements on your Web pages.
Go to Book VI to find out how to use Dreamweaver CS4 to create exciting 
Web sites that include text, images, and multimedia. Read Book VI, Chapter 1 
to discover all the new features in Dreamweaver, including a better interface, 
faster CSS integration, and improved Spry widget features.
Moving into Flash CS4
Flash combines stunning motion graphics, visual effects, and interactivity 
that have made it the industry standard for creating Web sites, CD-ROM pre-
sentations, and interactive learning tools.
Create graphics and type in Flash with its comprehensive set of drawing 
tools and then put them in motion with timeline-based animation, movie 
clips, and interactive buttons. Add photos, sound, and video for an even 
richer experience or use Flash’s built-in scripting language, ActionScript, to 
create complex interactive environments that stand out.
The most recent versions of Flash have continued to revolutionize the way 
Web sites, presentations, and rich Internet applications are built. With 
improved drawing tools, advanced video features, effects filters, and further 
improvements on ActionScript, Flash CS4 promises to continue its place as 
the “king of all media.”
Turn to Book VII to discover how to use Flash to create drawings and anima-
tions, to use ActionScript to create interactive Web pages, and more.

Welcoming you to Fireworks CS4
In the Design Premium suite, you now have a new tool for creating Web 
graphics! Fireworks is a much needed tool in the Creative Suite package 
because it offers features that were available in ImageReady in the CS2 suite.
You may wonder why Fireworks is included in the Design Premium suite 
when it already includes two other image editing programs, Photoshop and 
Illustrator. Among other things, Fireworks is great for mocking up Web page 
designs, making it quick and easy to design a Web page layout and Web appli-
cations. Fireworks also enables you to edit both bitmap and vector images.
Use Fireworks for the following tasks:
 
✦ Use Fireworks to compare file formats before exporting Web graphics.
 
✦ Create animations, rollovers, and pop-up windows.
 
✦ Create sliced images that use HTML tables or CSS (Cascading Style 
Sheets).
 
✦ Make wireframes, or mock up a Web site using the template and pages 
features.
Find out more about the helpful Web creation tools in Fireworks in Book VIII.
Crossing the Adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge is really an incredible application, especially with the CS4 
release because the processing speed is greatly improved and new features 
are available.
Bridge CS4 is a separate application that you can access through the 
Creative Suite applications. It allows you to quickly access and manage mul-
tiple documents (such as images, text files, and Adobe stock photos), which 
you can use in all the CS4 applications. Bridge CS4 also has a home area 
where users can get updates and tip and tricks about all programs in the 
Creative Suite.
Integrating Software
With so many great pieces of software in a single package, it’s only natural 
that you’ll want to start using the programs together to build exciting proj-
ects. You may want to design a book using InDesign (with photos edited in 
Photoshop and drawings created in Illustrator) and then create a Web site 
for that content in Dreamweaver. Similarly, you may want to take a complex

PDF file and make it into something that everyone can view online. Or you 
might create a symbol or Flash text in Illustrator and complete the animation 
in Flash. All the tools in the Adobe Creative Suite are built to work together, 
and achieving these tasks suddenly becomes much easier to do because the 
products are integrated.
Integrating software is typically advantageous to anyone. Integration allows 
you to streamline the workflow among programs and sometimes team mem-
bers. Tools exist that allow you to drop native images into Dreamweaver, 
InDesign, Illustrator, and Flash. With Adobe Bridge, you can view your files 
and investigate specifics about the file, such as color mode and file size, 
before selecting them for placement.

W
hen you work with Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium, you may 
notice that many menus, commands, and options are similar among 
its various programs. Discovering how to use menus and dialog boxes is 
essential to using the programs in the Creative Suite.
You may already be familiar with using dialog boxes and menus from other 
software packages. The way you use these elements is pretty much the 
same for any program. Some specific keyboard shortcuts are the same 
across programs, even ones made by different software companies. This 
consistency makes finding out how to use the commands and options very 
easy. This chapter provides an overview of some of the common menus, 
dialog boxes, options, commands, and preferences that exist in most or all 
the programs in Adobe CS4 Design Premium.
Discovering Common Menus
When you work with programs in Adobe CS4 Design Premium, you probably 
notice that many of the menus in the main menu bar are the same. And then 
you probably see that these menus often contain many of the same com-
mands across each program. These menus are somewhat similar to other 
graphics programs you may have used. Similar functionality makes finding 
certain commands easy, even when you’re completely new to the software 
you’re using.
Menus contain options and commands that control particular parts or 
functions of each program. You may have the option of opening a dialog 
box, which is used to input settings or preferences or to add something to 

Discovering Common Menus

a document. A menu may also contain commands that perform a particular 
action. For example, you may save the file as a result of selecting a particular 
command in a menu. Menus that commonly appear in the CS4 programs are
 
✦ File: Contains many commands that control the overall document, such 
as creating, opening, saving, printing, and setting general properties for 
the document. The File menu may also include options for importing or 
exporting data into or from the current document.
 
✦ Edit: Contains options and commands for editing the current document. 
Commands include copying, pasting, and selecting, as well as options for 
opening preferences and setting dialog boxes that are used to control 
parts of the document. Spell-checking and transforming objects are also 
common parts of the Edit menu.
 
✦ View: Contains options for changing the level of magnification of the 
document. The View menu also sometimes includes options for viewing 
the workspace in different ways, showing rules, grids, or guides, and 
turning on and off snapping.
 
✦ Window: Contains options that are primarily used to open or close what-
ever panels are available in the program. You can also choose how to 
view the workspace and save a favorite arrangement of the workspace.
 
✦ Help: Contains the option to open the Help documentation that’s 
included with the program. This menu may also include information 
about updating the software, registration, and tutorials.
Adobe Design Premium on the Mac also has an additional menu that bears 
the name of the program itself. This menu includes options for showing or 
hiding the program on the screen, opening preferences, and opening docu-
ments that provide information about the software.
Figure 2-1 shows a menu in Photoshop that contains many common options 
to control the program.
Notice that more menus are available in the programs than are in the pre-
vious list. Each program has additional program-specific menus that are 
determined by the specific needs of whatever software you’re using. For 
example, Photoshop has an Image menu that enables you to resize the image 
or document, rotate the canvas, and duplicate the image, among other func-
tions. InDesign has a Layout menu that allows you to navigate throughout 
the document, to edit page numbering, and to access controls for creating 
and editing the document’s table of contents. What additional menus exist in 
each program is determined by what the software is designed to do; we dis-
cuss these menus where appropriate throughout the book.

Using Dialog Boxes
A dialog box is a small window that contains a combination of options for-
matted as drop-down lists, panes, text fields, option buttons, check boxes, 
and buttons that enable you to make settings and enter information or data 
as necessary. The dialog boxes enable you to control the software or your 
document in various ways. For example, when you open a new file, you typi-
cally use the Open dialog box to select a file to open. When you save a file, 
you use a Save As dialog box to select a location to save the file in, name it, 
and execute the Save command.
Some dialog boxes also include tabs. These dialog boxes may need to con-
tain many settings of different types that are organized into several sections 
using tabs. Dialog boxes typically have a button that executes the particular 
command, and one that cancels and closes the dialog box without doing any-
thing. Figure 2-2 shows a common dialog box.
A dialog box in Windows is a lot like a dialog box you find on the Mac. Dialog 
boxes perform similar functions and include the same elements to enter or

select information. For example, some of the functions that dialog boxes 
perform include the following:
 
✦ Save a new version of a file.
 
✦ Set up your printing options or page setup.
 
✦ Set up the preferences for the software you’re using.
 
✦ Check spelling of text in a document.
 
✦ Open a new document.
 
Figure 2-2: 
An example 
of a dialog 
box for 
finding and 
replacing 
text in 
Dream-
weaver CS4.
 
 
When you have a dialog box open in the program you’re using, the window 
pops up on the screen. Before you can begin working with the program 
again, you have to close the dialog box. You can close the dialog box either 
by making your choices and clicking a button (such as Save or OK) when 
you’re finished, or clicking the Cancel button to close the dialog box without 
making any changes. You can’t use the program you’re working with until 
the dialog box is closed.
Encountering Alerts
Alerts are common on any operating system and in most programs. Alerts are 
similar to dialog boxes in that they’re small windows that contain information. 
However, alerts are different from dialog boxes because you can’t edit the infor-
mation in an alert. Alerts are designed to simply tell you something and give 
you one or more options made by clicking a button. For example, you may 
encounter an alert that indicates you can’t select a particular option. Usually 
you see an OK button to click to acknowledge and close the alert. You may 
have other buttons on the alert that will cancel what you were doing or a 
button that opens a dialog box. Figure 2-3 shows a typical alert.

Figure 2-3:

Alerts are also sometimes used to confirm actions before executing them. 
Sometimes these alert windows also offer the option (typically in the form 
of a check box) of not showing the alert or warning again. You may want to 
select this option if you repeatedly perform an action that shows the warn-
ing and you don’t need to see the warning each and every time.
Using Common Menu Options
Various menu options are typically available in each of the CS4 Design 
Premium programs. However, within each of these menus, several other 
options are available. Some of the options open dialog boxes, and those 
options are typically indicated by an ellipsis that follows the menu option, as 
shown in Figure 2-4.
 
Figure 2-4: 
If an ellipsis 
follows 
a menu 
option, a 
dialog box 
appears 
when 
selected.
 
The following menu options are found in several of the CS4 programs, and 
these commands either perform similar (or the same) functions or they 
open similar dialog boxes:
 
✦ New: Creates a brand new document in the native file format. For example, 
in InDesign, a new INDD (the extension for InDesign documents) file is 
created by choosing File➪New➪Document. You can sometimes choose 
what type of new file you want to create.
 
✦ Open: Opens a dialog box where you can choose a (supported) file on 
your hard drive or a disk to open.

About Contextual Menus
22
 
✦ Close: Closes the current document. If you have unsaved changes, 
you’re prompted to save those changes first.
 
✦ Save: Saves the changes you’ve made to the current document.
 
✦ Save As: Saves a new copy of the current document.
 
✦ Import: Imports a file into the current document, such as an image or 
sound file.
 
✦ Export: Exports the current data to a specified file format. You can 
sometimes select several different kinds of file formats to save the cur-
rent data in.
 
✦ Copy: Copies the currently selected data onto the computer’s Clipboard.
 
✦ Paste: Pastes the data from the Clipboard into the current document.
 
✦ Undo: Undoes the most recent thing you did in the program. For exam-
ple, if you just created a rectangle, the rectangle is removed from the 
document.
 
✦ Redo: Redoes the steps that you applied the Undo command to. For 
example, if you removed that rectangle you created, the Redo command 
adds it back to the document.
 
✦ Zoom In: Magnifies the document so that you can view and edit the con-
tents closely.
 
✦ Zoom Out: Scales the view smaller so that you can see more of the docu-
ment at once.
 
✦ Help: Opens the Help documentation for the current program.
About Contextual Menus
Contextual menus are available in all kinds of programs; they’re an incred-
ibly useful, quick way to make selections or issue commands. Contextual 
menus include some of the most useful commands you may find yourself 
choosing over and over again.
A contextual menu is similar to the menus that we describe in the previous 
sections; however, it’s context-sensitive and opens when you right-click 
(Windows) or Control-click (Mac) something in the program. Contextual 
means that what options appear in the menu depends on what object or 
item you right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac). For example, if you 
open a contextual menu when the cursor is over an image, commands involv-
ing the image are listed in the menu. However, if you right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac) the document’s background, you typically see options that 
affect the entire document instead of just a particular element within it. This 
means that you can select common commands specifically for the item that

23
you’ve selected. Figure 2-5 shows a contextual menu that appears when you 
right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) an object in Photoshop.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Open a 
contextual 
menu in 
Windows 
by right-
clicking an 
image or 
object.
 
 
Keep in mind that the tool you select in the toolbox may affect which con-
textual menus you can access in a document. You may have to select the 
Selection tool first to access some menus. If you want to access a contextual 
menu for a particular item in the document, make sure that the object is 
selected first before you right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac).
 
If you’re using a Mac, you can right-click to open a contextual menu if you 
have a two-button mouse hooked up to your Mac. Otherwise, you’d Control-
click to open a contextual menu.
Using Common Shortcuts
Shortcuts are key combinations that enable you to quickly and efficiently 
execute commands, such as saving, opening, or copying and pasting objects. 
Many of these shortcuts are listed in the menus discussed in the previous 
sections. If the menu option has a key combination listed next to it, you can 
press that key combination to access the command instead of using the 
menu to select it. Figure 2-6 shows associated shortcuts with a menu item.
For example, if you open the File menu, next to the Save option is Ctrl+S 
(Windows) or Ô+S (Mac). Instead of choosing File➪Save, you can press the 
shortcut keys to save your file. This is a very quick way to execute a particular 
command.
 
Some of the most common shortcuts in the Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design 
Premium programs are listed in Table 2-1.

Many additional shortcuts are available in each program in the CS4 programs, 
and they’re not all listed in the menus. You can find these shortcuts through-
out the documentation provided with each program. Memorizing the short-
cuts can take some time, but the time you save in the long run is worth it.
Changing Your Preferences
Setting your preferences is important when you’re working with new soft-
ware. Understanding what the preferences can do for you gives you a good 
idea about what the software does as well. All the programs in the Design

Premium Suite have different preferences; however, the way that the 
Preferences dialog box works in each program is the same.
The Preferences dialog box for each program can be opened by choosing 
Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Program Name➪Preferences➪General 
(Mac). The Preferences dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-7.
The Preferences dialog box contains a great number of settings you can con-
trol by entering values into text fields, using drop-down lists, buttons, check 
boxes, sliders, and other similar controls. Preferences can be quite detailed. 
However, you don’t have to know what each preference does or even change 
any of them. Most dialog boxes containing preferences are quite detailed 
in outlining what the preferences control and are therefore intuitive to use. 
Adobe also sometimes includes a Description area near the bottom of the 
dialog box. When you mouse over a particular control, a description of that 
control appears in the Description area.

In some Preferences dialog boxes, the left side of the dialog box has a list 
box containing the different categories of preferences that you can change. 
When you’re finished changing the settings in that topic, select a new topic 
from the list and change the settings for another topic.
In some programs, not all the settings you can modify are in the Preferences 
dialog box. For example, in Illustrator, you can change your color settings 
by choosing Edit➪Color Settings to open the Color Settings dialog box. What 
is very useful about this dialog box is that when you mouse over particu-
lar drop-down lists or buttons, a description of that control appears at the 
bottom of the dialog box.

By launching Adobe Bridge and choosing Edit➪Creative Suite Color Settings, 
you can change the color settings preferences across all the Design Premium 
programs at once, as shown in Figure 2-8.

In many CS4 programs, you have an option for setting up the main prefer-
ences for the overall document, such as setting up the page dimensions, the 
number of pages in the document, or the orientation (landscape or portrait) 
of the pages. In Dreamweaver and Photoshop, these kinds of options are 
available by choosing File➪Page Setup; in InDesign, Acrobat, and Illustrator, 
choose File➪Document Setup. Figure 2-9 shows a Document Setup dialog box.

✓ Getting to know the common panels in Adobe CS4
P
anels are an integral part of working with most of the programs in 
Adobe Creative Suite 4 (CS4) because they contain many of the con-
trols and tools that you use when you’re creating or editing a document.
The basic functionality of panels is quite similar across the programs in the 
Adobe Creative Suite, and the purpose of all panels is the same. Panels offer 
you a great deal of flexibility in how you organize the workspace and what parts 
of it you use. What you use each program for and the level of expertise you 
have may affect what panels you have open at a given moment. This chapter 
gives you an overview of how to work with the panels you find in Adobe CS4.
Understanding the Synchronized Workspace
One thing that you immediately notice when opening the applications in the 
Creative Suite is the synchronized workspace. All the applications look very 
similar and have the same set of features to help you organize your workspace.
The tools in InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop appear as a space-saving, 
single-column toolbar, and panels are arranged in convenient, self-adjusting 
docks that can be widened to full size or narrowed so that the panels are 
collapsed to icons.
Here are some pointers to help you navigate the workspace in the Creative 
Suite applications:
 
✦ Expand your tools to two columns by clicking the right-facing double 
arrows in the gray bar on top of the tools.
 
✦ Collapse the tools to a single column by clicking the left-facing double 
arrows in the gray bar on top of the tools.

Using Panels in the Workspace
28
 
✦ To expand a docked panel, simply click the icon in the docking area, as 
shown in Figure 3-1. The panel that you selected expands but goes away 
when you select a different panel.
 
 If you’re having difficulty identifying the panel, you can choose the panel 
you want from the Window menu.
 
✦ Expand all the docked panels by clicking the left-facing double-arrow 
icon at the top of the docking area; put them away by clicking the right-
facing double-arrow icon in the gray bar above the panels.
 
✦ To undock a panel, simply click the tab (where the panel name is 
located) and drag it out of the docking area. You can re-dock the panel 
by dragging the panel back into the docking area.

Using Panels in the Workspace
Panels are small windows in a program that contain controls, such as sliders, 
menus, buttons, and text fields, that you can use to change the settings or 
attributes of a selection or of the entire document. Panels may also include 
information about a section or about the document itself. You can use this 
information or change the settings in a panel to modify the selected object 
or the document you’re working on.

Book I
Chapter 3
Exploring Common 
Panels
Using Panels in the Workspace

Whether you’re working on a Windows machine or on a Mac, panels are very 
similar in the way they look and work. Here are the basics of working with 
panels:
 
✦ Opening: Open a panel in one of the Creative Suite programs by using 
the Window menu; choose Window and then select the name of a panel. 
For example, to open the Swatches panel (which is similar in many pro-
grams in the suite), choose Window➪Swatches.
 
✦ Closing: If you need to open or close a panel’s tab or panel altogether, 
just choose Window➪Panel’s Tab Name. Sometimes a panel contains 
a close button (an X button in Windows or the red button on a Mac), 
which you can click to close the panel.
 
✦ Organizing the workspace: All the programs in the Creative Suite now 
offer options for workspace organization. You can return to the default 
workspace, which puts panels back in their original location, by choos-
ing Window➪Workspace➪Default. You can also open the frequently 
used panels, position them where you want, and save a customized 
workspace by choosing Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace. Name 
the workspace and click OK; the saved workspace is now a menu item 
that you can open by choosing Window➪Workspace➪Your Saved 
Workspace’s Name.
 
 You can also choose from a wide range of included presets that are 
designed for a variety of specialized tasks.
 
✦ Accessing the panel menu: Panels have a panel menu, which opens 
when you click the arrow in the upper-right corner of the panel, as 
shown in Figure 3-2. The panel menu contains a bunch of options you 
can select that relate to the tab currently selected when you click the 
panel menu. When you select one of the options in the panel menu, it 
may execute an action or open a dialog box. Sometimes a panel menu 
has very few options, but particular panels may have a whole bunch of 
related functionality and therefore many options in the panel menu.

arrow in the 
upper right 
to see the 
panel menu.  

Using Panels in the Workspace
30
 
✦ Minimizing/maximizing: All you need to do to minimize a selected 
panel is to click the Collapse to Icons double-arrow button in the title 
bar of the panel (if it’s available). If the panel is undocked, you can also 
double-click the tab itself (of an undocked panel) in the panel. This will 
either partially or fully minimize the panel. If it only partially minimizes, 
double-clicking the tab again fully minimizes the panel. Double-clicking 
the active tab when it’s minimized maximizes the panel again.
 
 Panels that partially minimize give you the opportunity to work with 
panels that have differing amounts of information. This simplifies the 
workspace while maximizing your screen real estate.
Most panels contain tabs, which help organize information and controls in a 
program into groupings. Panel tabs contain a particular kind of information 
about a part of the program; a single panel may contain several tabs. The 
name on the tab usually gives you a hint about the type of function it con-
trols or displays information about, and it is located at the top of the panel 
(refer to Figure 3-2). Inactive tabs are dimmed.
Moving panels
You can move panels all around the workplace, and you can add or remove 
single tabs from a panel. Each panel snaps to other panels, which makes 
it easier to arrange panels alongside each other. Panels can overlap each 
other as well. To snap panels to each other, drag the panel to a new location 
on-screen, as shown in Figure 3-3; you see the top bar of the panel become 
shaded indicating that it’s becoming part of another panel’s group.
Grouping similar tabs by moving them into a single grouped panel is a good 
idea — it makes accessing the different functions in your document a lot 
easier because you have less searching to do to find related functions for a 
task if similar panels are grouped together.
You can hide all panels by pressing the Tab key. Press the Tab key again to 
reveal all the panels you’ve hidden.

its tab.

Looking at common panels
Many panels are similar across programs in the Creative Suite. Although 
each panel doesn’t have exactly the same contents in each of the programs 
it’s included in, many are extremely similar in what they contain. You use 
these panels in very similar ways, no matter what program or operating 
system you’re using.
 
Acrobat doesn’t contain numerous panels like the other programs in the 
Creative Suite. Instead, Acrobat relies mainly (but not entirely) on a system 
of menus and toolbars filled with buttons and drop-down lists. In Acrobat, 
you can open dialog boxes that contain a bunch of settings you can enter for 
your documents.
The following panels aren’t available in all the programs in the Creative 
Suite. However, you find them in most of the programs:
 
✦ Color: The Color panel is used to select or to mix colors for use in the 
document you’re currently working on. You can use different color 
modes and several ways of mixing or choosing colors in the Colors 
panel.
 
✦ Info: The Info panel shows you information about the document itself or 
a particular selection you’ve made. The Info panel includes information 
on size, positioning, and rotation of selected objects. You can’t enter data 
into the Info panel. The Info panel only displays information instead of 
accepting it, so you’d have to use the Transform panel (described in a bit) 
to make these modifications, if necessary.
 
✦ Swatches: The Swatches panel can be used to create a swatch library, 
which can be saved and imported into other documents or other pro-
grams. You can store colors and gradients that you use repeatedly in the 
Swatches panel.
 
✦ Tools: The Tools panel (commonly called the toolbox) isn’t available in 
all the Creative Suite programs, but it’s a very important panel in the 
programs it does exist in. The toolbox is used to select tools, such as the 
Pencil, Brush, or Pen tool, that you use to create objects in a document.
 
✦ Layers: The Layers panel is used to display and select layers. The Layers 
panel also enables you to change layer order and helps you select items 
on a particular layer.
 
✦ Align: The Align panel enables you to align selected objects to each 
other or align them in relation to the document itself. This enables you 
to arrange objects in a precise way.
 
✦ Stroke: The Stroke panel allows you to select strokes and change the 
attributes of those strokes, such as the color, width/weight, style, and 
cap. The program you’re using determines what attributes you can 
change.

Using Panels in the Workspace
32
 
✦ Transform: The Transform panel is used to display and change the shear 
(skew), rotation, position, and size of a selected object in the document. 
You can enter new values for each of these transformations.
 
✦ Character: The Character panel is used to select fonts, font size, charac-
ter spacing, and other settings related to using type in your documents.

Chapter 4: Using Common 
Extensions
In This Chapter
✓ Discovering the real purpose of filters and extensions
✓ Using common extensions and filters in Adobe CS4
E
xtensions (also known as plug-ins) are pieces of software that you install 
or save on your computer that work as add-ons to existing programs. 
For example, an extension may enable you to integrate with a different pro-
gram, or it may help add functionality to the program (such as the ability 
to create 3D text). Extensions may allow you to change the appearance of 
an object in your software or add a 3D effect to a video file. Filters are used 
to change parts of a document. Even if you haven’t used Photoshop, you’re 
probably already familiar with some of the popular Photoshop filters, such 
as the filters used for artistic effects, like the Watercolor and Emboss filters. 
This chapter shows you common plug-ins, extensions, and filters, as well as 
how to use them in the Creative Suite.
Looking at Common Extensions and Filters
Extensions are sometimes used for similar tasks in several programs and are 
designed to enhance a program’s existing capabilities. Extensions and filters 
can also dramatically speed up the creative process. At the mere click of a 
button, you can add an amazing effect to your project that may have taken 
many hours to accomplish without the plug-in.
Additional filters and plug-ins for the programs are available or linked from 
the Adobe Web site. It’s also very easy to find plug-ins on the Web for down-
load as well. A search yields many results for these packages. A good place 
to start is at the Adobe Exchange, located at www.adobe.com/cfusion/
exchange/index.cfm. This site includes a wealth of tools that you can 
download and install for the all the applications in the Creative Suite.
 
Filters for Photoshop are probably the most common kind of add-on you 
find online. You have to purchase many filters before you can download and 
use them; however, some filters are offered for free.

Looking at Common Extensions and Filters

Plugging into InDesign
InDesign offers many filters for importing and exporting text. Plug-ins are 
available that enable you to work with PageMaker and for helping to import 
and paste in other content. Many plug-ins for InDesign are designed to help 
you with the following functions:
 
✦ Lay out spreads correctly for a printer.
 
✦ Create sophisticated indexes and tables of contents.
 
✦ Create advanced cross-references within your documents.
 
✦ Create page previews and thumbnails of your documents.
Other filters created for InDesign can help you import certain content, such 
as text. A lot of the time, you’ll find that text formatting is lost when you 
import content into InDesign. Filters can help you retain this original format-
ting when you’re importing text. These plug-ins and filters are just a small 
sample of what’s available for InDesign. In all likelihood, many more plug-ins 
will be created for the software.
Installing extensions
Extensions can be installed in a few different 
ways. Sometimes they’re installed using an 
executable file: You double-click the file on 
your hard drive, and it automatically installs the 
software. This is a lot like installing any other 
program on your computer, such as the pro-
grams in the Creative Suite itself.
Sometimes you’re given individual files that 
need to be placed in a folder first. In this case, 
you need to find the Plug-Ins folder on your 
computer in the install directory of the program 
the plug-in or filter is for. For example, if your 
plug-in is for InDesign on Windows, you’d need 
to find this directory: C:\Program Files\
Adobe\InDesign CS4\Plug-Ins. You’d 
then copy and paste or move the files you down-
loaded into this directory on your hard drive. If 
your plug-in is for Photoshop on the Mac, you’d 
need to find this folder on your hard drive: 
Applications\Adobe Photoshop 
CS4\Plug-Ins. You’d then copy and paste 
or move the files into this folder.
If you’re installing extensions for Flash or 
Dreamweaver, you can also take advantage 
of the Adobe Extension Manager CS4 applica-
tion that installs automatically with the default 
CS4 installation. Locate the Extension Manager 
in your Programs (Windows) or Applications 
(Mac) folder and double-click to launch it. 
Select the application that you wish to install 
the extension into, click the Install button to 
locate the extension you wish to install, click 
the Select button, and you’re on your way!
If it’s not clear how to install a plug-in, locate 
instructions for the software that explain how 
to install it on your computer. You can find 
instructions on the manufacturer’s Web site, 
or instructions may be bundled with the plug-in 
file itself in a text file (usually readme.txt).

Adding on to Photoshop
Photoshop has a lot of plug-ins and filters already included with the program 
when you install it that give more functionality to the program. Not only can you 
find additional filters, but you can also find plug-ins to add new features that can 
inevitably add some interesting effects to your documents. You can also find a 
plug-in that installs a great number of filters into Photoshop. The kinds of filters 
and plug-ins you can find for Photoshop create the following effects:
 
✦ Remove blemishes and scratches from photos using special tools.
 
✦ Create 3D text, objects, and effects using several different plug-ins. 
Effects include drop shadows, bevels, and embosses that go beyond 
what’s already available in Photoshop.
 
✦ Use special masking tools to create amazing selections of difficult items 
like fur and hair.
 
✦ Use one of thousands of special effects made by many companies to 
enhance, modify, and add to your images.
 
✦ Add a frame from a library to place around your favorite images.
These are only some of the many Photoshop plug-ins (which are commonly 
a set of many filters bundled together) available.
Many plug-ins have custom interfaces that you can use to make your set-
tings. These interfaces include sliders, text fields, and buttons, and usually a 
thumbnail preview of how the filter is affecting the image. These interfaces 
vary greatly in style and features, but they’re usually fairly intuitive and easy 
to use.
Using Illustrator plug-ins
You can find many tools to extend the capabilities of Illustrator. Plug-ins are 
available that enable you to take 3D illustration farther than the standard 
3D features allow. You can create forms from your drawings and also take 
your 3D files and turn them into line drawings. Other plug-ins, ranging from 
simple to very complex, allow you to
 
✦ Create multipage documents.
 
✦ Organize your font sets.
 
✦ Add common symbols (such as road signage) to use in your documents. 
The symbols are organized into libraries that you can use right in the 
Illustrator workspace.
 
✦ Import CAD (Computer-Aided Design) files into a document.
 
✦ Create interactive documents.
 
✦ Handle patterns geared at creating textures and backgrounds.

Looking at Common Extensions and Filters
36
You can enhance Illustrator’s capabilities after you download and install a 
few plug-ins. Simple projects become much more interesting or complex by 
merely entering a value and clicking a button.
 
Some fun things to download and install into Illustrator are custom brushes. 
This means that you can have a wider array of brushes available to work 
with when you create drawings and illustrations. Styles can also be installed 
into Illustrator and usually obtained for free. You can also download and 
install custom brushes for Photoshop.
Adding on capabilities to Acrobat
Acrobat has several plug-ins available that help speed up and diversify your 
project workflow. Some plug-ins available for Acrobat are designed to help 
you
 
✦ Add new stamps to the documents.
 
✦ Add features, such as page numbering and watermarks.
 
✦ Streamline productivity by offering solutions for batch processing.
 
✦ Convert file formats to diversify what kinds of documents you can create 
from Acrobat.
 
✦ Work with and fix the PDF (Portable Document Format) in prepress 
quickly and efficiently.
Many of the plug-ins available for Acrobat enable you to batch process the 
pages in a document. This means that all the pages are processed at one 
time. Many plug-ins for Acrobat help save you a lot of time when you’re cre-
ating PDF files. Plug-ins are usually designed to be very easy to use and can 
thus save you from having to perform a tedious and repetitive task.
Plug-ins for Acrobat are available from the Adobe Web site, as well as numer-
ous third-party Web sites.
Extending Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver offers you a quick and easy way to make Web pages, but you 
can add more tools to Dreamweaver to diversify what the program can do. 
These extensions (essentially, plug-ins) also speed up the process of creating 
Web sites. Some of the available plug-ins are described in the following list:
 
✦ Add e-commerce modules to a Web site automatically.
 
✦ Create professional DHTML (Dynamic HTML) and CSS (Cascading Style 
Sheets)-based vertical and horizontal menus.
 
✦ Add a calendar popup.
 
✦ Add PayPal to your Web site.

Chapter 4

37
Dreamweaver also allows you to use behaviors in the program. Behaviors 
are premade JavaScript scripts that can be added to your Web sites for addi-
tional interactivity or interest. You can also use premade templates for your 
sites, many of which are available at www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange.
Using Filters or Plug-Ins
You can install plug-ins or filters into your Creative Suite programs. For 
example, a filter can enhance an existing photo in a very exciting way. After 
you install a plug-in into Photoshop or Illustrator that includes a bunch of 
additional filters, check out what the filter can do to your photos.
Install some filters for Photoshop (or Illustrator or any other program in the 
suite). After you complete the installation and restart your computer, if nec-
essary, open Photoshop and locate the Filter menu option (the new filters 
are available in this menu).
To use a filter or plug-in after installing it, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a file in the appropriate program so that you can try your new 
filter or plug-in.
 
 For example, if you downloaded a Photoshop plug-in that added a new 
filter, open an interesting photo that you want to apply an effect to in 
Photoshop. Choose a photo that has many colors or a lot of contrast to 
work with.
 
2. Choose a filter from the Filter menu.
 
 Select a filter that you’ve installed from the Filter menu. You may also 
find that a plug-in created a new menu item in the program — in that 
case, use the new menu item to apply the effect.
 
3. Modify the filter’s (or plug-in’s) settings, if necessary, and click OK to 
apply the effect.
 
 Sometimes, you have a thumbnail preview to assess how the filter 
changes the image. For some filters and plug-ins, you even use a custom 
interface to manipulate the document. You can then change the set-
tings accordingly until you’re happy with the modifications that will be 
applied.
 
4. Look at the image or document after you choose and apply the filter 
or plug-in.
 
 Your image or file is updated immediately. If you’re unhappy with the 
results, you can either undo your changes by choosing Edit➪Undo, or 
you can apply the filter or plug-in again.

Using Filters or Plug-Ins
38
 
Filters add a great deal of interest and variety to a document. However, you 
can easily go overboard when using filters and plug-ins. You can use filters 
in many different ways in the Design Premium Suite — and some of these 
ways you use filters (and the filters themselves) are considered better than 
others. Going into filter overload is easy, particularly when you first start 
using filters. This is okay when you’re experimenting with filters; just make 
sure that you don’t use too many filters on one part of an image when you’re 
creating a final project. For example, if you bevel and emboss a particular 
letter in a few different ways, that character can become illegible. Similarly, 
adding a huge drop shadow can distract the eye from other parts of the text.
The trick is knowing what you intend to accomplish with your document 
before you actually go about creating it. If you set out to create your project 
with a particular design in mind, you can sometimes achieve better results. 
Try drawing your ideas on paper first, writing down some notes about what 
you want to achieve, and thinking about the plug-ins you want to use to 
achieve it. Use one filter at a time and make sure that you like the results 
before moving on to the next. The alternative is to continue adding filter 
upon filter to achieve a particular result when you aren’t quite sure what 
you’re after or how to get there. You can end up with a picture with too 
many filters applied and an unpleasant result. With a clear idea of what you 
want out of a picture and what filters you need to achieve that effect, you’ll 
use filters in a much more successful way.

Exporting

I
mporting and exporting content are important tasks for much of the cre-
ative process you experience while using programs in the Creative Suite. 
You commonly find yourself importing content to work within your docu-
ments. You may want to import text composed by a designated writer into 
an InDesign document so that you can include the content in a page layout. 
Or you may want to import a 3D design into an Illustrator document so that 
you can use the image in a design. Importing is necessary in all kinds of 
circumstances during a typical workflow.
Exporting content from each program is sometimes necessary when you 
want to save the document as a different file format. You may want to do 
this for compatibility reasons: Your audiences, or those you’re working 
with, need a different file format in order to open your work; or you may 
need to export to a different file format in order to import the work into a 
different program.
Discovering the Adobe Bridge Application
With this version of the Creative Suite, Adobe has dramatically enhanced the 
Adobe Bridge application. The Adobe Bridge application helps you organize 
and manage your assets, such as pictures, text, movie and audio files, as 
well as non-Adobe applications like Word or Excel files to name a few. Adobe 
Bridge acts like a hub for the Creative Suite; for example, by choosing to open 
files using the Bridge interface, you can browse directories quickly and see 
thumbnail previews of your files, as shown in Figure 5-1. You can even use 
the Filter panel to help you find files and view metadata to your file, including 
important information such as keywords and copyright information.

Discovering the Adobe Bridge Application

Figure 5-1: 
The Adobe

Not only does Bridge make a great deal of information accessible; you can 
use Bridge as a central resource for all your Help needs.
 
Not all Adobe Bridges are the same. If you installed your Adobe programs 
separately (not using the Creative Suite installer), you may be lacking some 
features. If you notice some features are mentioned in this chapter that you 
don’t have access to, check to see if all the CS4 applications are installed or 
run the CS4 installer again.
Accessing the Bridge software
Knowing where to locate the Adobe Bridge application is helpful. The Bridge 
application should already be in your system if you went through a standard 
installation of the entire Creative Suite. Otherwise, go back and choose to 
install the Bridge software using your installation CDs. After you install the 
Bridge software, you can open it in the following two ways:
 
✦ Access the Bridge software with the directory system of your computer. 
Choose C:\Programs\Adobe\Adobe Bridge\Bridge (Windows) or 
Hard Drive\Applications\Adobe Bridge\Bridge (Mac).
 
✦ Select the Launch Bridge button in the Application bar, as shown in 
Figure 5-2. If you don’t see the Launch Bridge icon, you can choose 
File➪Browse in Bridge. You can launch into Bridge from any of the appli-
cations included in the Creative Suite.

Navigating in Adobe Bridge
To navigate Bridge, simply use the Folders panel in the upper left to choose 
the folder you want to view. Watch in amazement as previews are created 
and automatically replace the standard file format icon.
 
Adobe Bridge may take a fair amount of time to build the preview the first 
time you use it, so be patient. You can choose Tools➪Cache➪Build and 
Export Cache to save this data, or choose Tools➪Cache➪Purge Cache to 
free up file space.
Select an individual file by clicking it once (twice opens it), or select multiple 
files by Ctrl-clicking (Windows) or Ô-clicking (Mac).
With one or more files selected, you can do the following:
 
✦ Relocate the file(s) to another location by dragging it to a folder in 
the Folders panel in the upper-left corner. Use Bridge as a central filing 
system. With the commands in the File menu, you can create new fold-
ers and delete or move files or groups of files.
 
✦ Read metadata in the Metadata panel in the lower-right corner. This 
includes information, such as Camera, Flash, F-stop, and more. See 
Figure 5-3.
 
✦ Enter your own metadata for any item listed by clicking the pencil 
icon to the right.
 
✦ Use the Keywords panel, as shown in Figure 5-4, to enter your own 
keywords to help you find your images later.
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Find or use the Filter panel to locate your files within 
the Bridge by entering criteria, such as Keywords, Description, Date 
Created, and more.

files. You can then choose Stacks➪Group as Stack, or use the keyboard 
shortcut Ctrl+G (Windows) or Ô+G (Mac). This stacks the images into 
one compact thumbnail, as shown in Figure 5-5. The number of images 
in the stack is shown in the upper left of the image stack. To re-open 
the stack, click the stack number; to close it, click the stack number 
again. If you decide you don’t want the stack any more, you can choose 
Stacks➪Ungroup from Stack, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G 
(Windows) or Ô+Shift+G (Mac).

The color settings that you use to set in each individual application can be 
set across the board in all Creative Suite applications. Create consistent 
color choices in all the Creative Suite applications with the synchronized 
color management controls that Adobe Bridge offers.
Choose Edit➪Creative Suite Color Settings to choose a color management 
setting that remains consistent through all your Creative Suite applications, 
as shown in Figure 5-6. Read more about what these settings mean in Book 
IV, Chapter 7.
 
The setting for Joe’s Press (see Figure 5-6) was created in Adobe Photoshop. If 
your printer can send you Joe’s Press’ color settings, you can load them using 
the Suite Color Settings dialog box in Photoshop, and then make them acces-
sible to all your CS4 applications by selecting the settings in Adobe Bridge.

Importing Files into a Document
Importing files works similarly, no matter what program you’re working 
with. Importing content is more important in some programs than others. 
A program like InDesign relies on importing content into a document that’s 
then incorporated into a page layout. However, in programs like Photoshop, 
importing content is much less important because you’ll frequently start out 
with editing an image you open in Photoshop. In this section, we take a look 
at importing content into each program.
Placing content in InDesign
Placing content in InDesign is a familiar task when you’re creating a new 
layout. You need to import images and text for many of your layouts. When 
you choose File➪Place, you can then select text or image files from your 
hard drive or network. You can also choose sound and video files that you 
can use when you’re creating PDF documents for electronic distribution. 
After you choose a file to import, a new cursor icon appears, with a thumb-
nail preview of your image, when you place it over the page or pasteboard. 
To place the imported content, click the page where you want the upper-left 
corner to be placed.
When you import different kinds of images, you’re presented with the Place 
dialog box, which allows you to select a variety of options for importing the 
selected content. However, to access additional settings, you must select the 
Show Import Options check box in the Place dialog box. In Figure 5-7, you 
see the additional options that appear when an image is placed.

Figure 5-7: 
When 
importing 
text and 
graphics, 
you can see 
additional 
options.
 
Select a file and click the Open button. Another dialog box opens with 
options specific to the type of file you’re importing. For example, if you’re 
importing a bitmap image (say, a JPEG), you can choose how you want the 
bitmap to appear, whether it contains a background or color management 
information, and other such options.
When you import text information, you may lose some text formatting that 
was made in the original file. Anything that InDesign doesn’t understand 
won’t be imported into the document. Column information, as well as mar-
gins, is also typically not retained when you import text. However, some 
plug-ins are available that help remedy the situation to some extent.
 
You can use the Launch Bridge button in the center of the Application bar in 
InDesign to open Adobe Bridge. Then, simply drag and drop the images you 
want to use right from Bridge.
Adding content to a Photoshop file
In Photoshop, you can choose to open an image to work with or you can 
import content into a document that’s open already. Choose File➪Place to 
import PDF, AI, EPS, or PDP files. These files import onto a new layer in the 
document, and you can then use tools to manipulate the imported content, 
as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
As a default, your placed Illustrator file embeds into the Photoshop file. 
This is the Smart Object feature that you can read about in Book IV, Chapter 
9. Double-click the placed artwork layer to open and edit the embedded 
Illustrator file. After the file’s been saved, the changes are immediately 
reflected in Photoshop! Note that your original file isn’t changed.

Placing files into Illustrator
Illustrator allows you to place images and other forms of data in a new docu-
ment. You can import Photoshop, PDF, image, and vector files by choosing 
File➪Place. The Place dialog box appears, allowing you to choose a file to 
import. Click Place to import the file. An Import dialog box may appear at 
this point, depending on the type of file you’re importing. This dialog box 
offers you several options for choosing a way to import the content into 
Illustrator. For example, you can sometimes choose between flattening 
layers or retaining layers when you import a document containing layers.
EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is a commonly used file format for saving 
vector drawings (although it can be used for other file types as well). 
Because this file format is used in many programs, you may find other 
people giving you these files to work with. To import an EPS document, you 
also choose File➪Place; after you import an EPS document into Illustrator, 
the file is converted to Illustrator objects, but it isn’t editable. To edit the 
EPS object, choose File➪Open to open the file.
You can also import text files into Illustrator. Microsoft Word, TXT (text 
only), RTF (rich text format), and Unicode, among other text documents, 
are all supported by Illustrator, and you can import them by choosing 
File➪Place. When you import the text file, you’re prompted to choose the 
character set used for the text.
Not only can you use the Place command for importing files, but you can 
copy and paste from other programs. You can select part of an image in 
Photoshop and copy it onto the Clipboard by pressing Ctrl+C (Windows) or 
Ô+C (Mac), and then pasting it into the Illustrator document.

Use the Place command whenever possible to avoid losing quality in the 
content you’re importing. Also, transparency isn’t supported from one appli-
cation to another when you copy and paste, but it is when Place is used.
 
When you have particular plug-ins installed, you can import additional file 
types, such as CAD files, into Illustrator.
Adding to Acrobat
Adobe Acrobat is primarily a tool for sharing completed documents — you’ll 
do most of your document construction and editing in other programs, such 
as InDesign or Illustrator. However, you can import several kinds of data into 
PDF documents, and you can do some creative things when you place data 
into PDF files as well:
 
✦ Comments: Probably the most useful and common items to import into 
an Adobe PDF file are comments made using the review and markup 
tools provided by Adobe Acrobat. By importing comments into a PDF 
file, you can consolidate suggestions and input from several review-
ers (those editing a document) into a single document. This feature 
helps the reviewing process when many people are working on a 
single document. To import someone’s comments into a PDF, choose 
Comments➪Import Comments. If you’re reviewing a document, you can 
also export only the comments rather than send the document owner 
the entire PDF file.
 
✦ Form data: You can import form data into a PDF document by choosing 
Forms➪Manage Form Data➪Import Data. The data that you import can 
be generated by exporting the form data from another PDF form, or it 
can come from a delimited text file. This allows you to share form data 
between forms or from a database.
 
✦ Trusted identities: If you share digitally-signed files or secured files 
with other Acrobat users, you can import the public version of their 
signature file into your list of trusted users with whom you share files. 
To import the identity of a user, choose Advanced➪Manage Trusted 
Identities, and in the Manage Trusted Identities dialog box that appears, 
click the Add Contacts button.
 
✦ Multimedia files: If you’ve ever had the urge to add a movie or sound 
file into your PDF documents, you’re in luck. By using the Sound tool or 
Movie tool, you can identify the location on the page where you want 
the file to appear, and then choose whether to embed the multimedia 
file (compatible with Acrobat 6 or later) or create a link to the file (com-
patible with Acrobat 5 and earlier).
 
✦ Buttons: Creating buttons to turn pages, print a document, or go to a Web 
site makes your PDF files easier to use. Adding custom button images, 
such as pictures of arrows or a printer icon, makes your document 
unique. Use the Button tool to create the location of the button and then 

Importing Files into a Document
48
select the graphic file that will be used as the image on the button. The 
image file that you use must first be converted to a PDF graphic.
 
✦ Preflight information: If you’re creating a PDF file that will be sent to 
a commercial printer for reproduction, you may want to preflight the 
file to check that it meets the specifications and needs of the printer. If 
your printer has supplied a preflight profile for Acrobat, you can import 
the profile to ensure that Acrobat checks for the things your printer has 
requested, such as certain font types or color specifications. Import a 
preflight profile by choosing Advanced➪Print Production➪Preflight, and 
in the Preflight window that opens, choose Options➪Import Preflight 
Profile.
Importing into Dreamweaver
In Dreamweaver, you can import several different kinds of files into a site 
you’re creating:
 
✦ Insert images and other media, such as Flash, FlashPaper, and Flash 
Video with the Insert menu item.
 
✦ Import XML files and XHTML exports from InDesign.
 
✦ Cut and paste a layered file in Photoshop. Simply choose Edit➪Copy 
Merged and paste it right into Dreamweaver. An Image Preview window 
appears (see Figure 5-9), allowing you to optimize the image for the Web. 
Choose your settings and click OK. (You can read about the best 
settings for Web imagery in Book IV, Chapter 10.)

Exporting Your Documents
Exporting content from your Adobe Creative Suite documents is important 
if you’re working with importing the content into another program, placing 
the document where it’s publicly available and where it needs to be inter-
preted on other computers. Similarly, you may be working with a team of 
individuals who need your document to be readable on their machines when 
it’s imported into other programs. Exporting your document as a different 
file format helps solve these issues, and the Adobe Creative Suite offers you 
the flexibility of allowing you to export your document as many different file 
formats.
 
Other programs sometimes accept native Adobe documents as files that 
you can import. For example, Adobe Flash CS4 can import Illustrator AI files, 
Photoshop PSD files, and PDF documents.
Exporting from InDesign
InDesign enables you to export your pages or book as several file types. 
Most notably, you can export your layouts as a PDF document, which 
anyone who has the free Adobe Reader installed can view. InDesign can 
also export to other image and vector formats, such as EPS and JPEG. An 
InDesign document can also export to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and 
XML (Extensible Markup Language), which is useful when you export some-
thing for the Web. InDesign has the very handy feature to package up your 
work for Dreamweaver. By choosing File➪Cross-Media Export➪XHTML/For 
Dreamweaver, you can export a project you’re working on and have it ready 
for page creation in Dreamweaver (see Figure 5-10).

Exporting content from Photoshop
Photoshop can export paths in a document to Illustrator (an AI file). This 
means that your work in Photoshop is easy to manipulate after you open it 
with Illustrator.
You have another option, though: You can export your Photoshop file with 
the Zoomify feature. This great feature can export a large file to a smaller, 
more compact SWF file. This file can be easily sent via e-mail and opened 
with the free Flash Player that most everyone already has installed.
To use Zoomify, do the following:
 
1. Choose File➪Export➪Zoomify.
 
2. Click Folder in the Output Location section of the Zoomify dialog box 
and choose a folder location to save your SWF file to.
 
3. Choose the quality and size and then click OK.
 
 The Zoomify Preview window appears (see Figure 5-11). Use this window 
to zoom in to see detail.
 
 You can then retrieve the files that were created in your destination 
folder and post them online, or attach them to an e-mail message.
Exporting Illustrator files
Illustrator supports exporting to many different file formats. You can export 
files in a long list of image formats. Choose File➪Export, and the Export 
dialog box opens. Click the Save as Type (Windows) or Format (Mac) drop-
down list to view the exportable file formats.
After you choose a file type to export to, a second dialog box may appear, 
allowing you to enter a bunch of settings for the exported file.
Try choosing the Flash SWF file format when you export a file. A second 
dialog box opens that includes many settings, such as options to generate 
an HTML page, save each layer as a separate SWF document, and preserve 
editability (when possible). The options that are available when you export 
a document depend on the type of file format to which you’re exporting.
Exporting Acrobat content
Acrobat allows you to export certain parts of a PDF document that you’re 
working on. For example, you may be using form data — the data that’s 
filled into a form made of text fields and so on — in one of your files. You 
can export this data from Acrobat and then send it online, which is great 
because PDF documents tend to be rather large for the Web. Therefore, only 
a small amount of formatted data is sent online rather than a huge PDF file.

You can also export parts of an Acrobat document to use in other programs. 
You can export comments in a PDF to a Microsoft Word file that was used to 
create the PDF by choosing Comments➪Export Comments➪To Word. You 
can also export comments to an AutoCAD file (assuming that it was used 
to create the PDF). In both cases, you need the original document that was 
used to generate the PDF file in order to successfully import the comments.
Similarly, you can export all comments from a PDF file by choosing 
Comments➪Export Comments➪To File and then import them into another 
version of the same document. You can use this option to consolidate com-
ments from multiple reviewers, or overlay comments from a draft with a 
final version to confirm that all edits were completed.

52
Exporting Dreamweaver content
In Dreamweaver, you can export your sites so that they’re prepared for pub-
lishing and ready to be placed on a live Web site. The site you’re working on 
in Dreamweaver is exported onto your hard drive before you put it some-
where on a server. The HTML styles used in a site you’re working on can be 
exported and saved as an XML document, which in turn can be reused if nec-
essary. These files can then be imported into another Dreamweaver project 
you’re working on.

Chapter 6: Handling Graphics, 
Paths, Text, and Fonts
In This Chapter
✓ Livening up your documents with graphics
✓ Getting control of paths and strokes
✓ Getting the scoop on text and font fundamentals
✓ Creating a layout
G
raphics, paths, text, and fonts are all integral parts of creating docu-
ments with Adobe Creative Suite. You must know how to handle each 
element in your documents and how to work with these elements together. 
Discovering the different ways you can work with images, text, and drawing 
is the fun part!
Whether you’re designing Web sites or creating a brochure’s layout, you 
can use these elements on their own or together, and it’s likely you’ll find 
out something new each time you work with them. A layout can include text, 
images, and drawings, but sometimes the layout includes more. If you’re 
creating documents for the Web or you’re creating PDF (Portable Document 
Format) files with multimedia elements, you may be working with sound, 
animation, and video alongside text, images, and illustrations.
Using Graphics in Your Documents
A graphic can be an image, a drawing, or a vector graphic. You can create 
graphics manually by making marks on a page, or you can create them electron-
ically with software. Graphics can be displayed in many formats, such as on a 
computer screen, projected onto a wall, or printed in a magazine or book.
Computer graphics come in many forms, grouped by the way they’re cre-
ated electronically. Bitmap and vector graphics are formed in different ways 
to achieve the end result that you use in your documents.

Using Graphics in Your Documents
54
Working with bitmap images
Bitmap images are pictures that are made up of many tiny squares, or bits, 
on an invisible grid. When these dots are next to each other, the picture is 
formed, depending on where and how the colors are arranged on the grid. 
The dots are also called pixels, and if you zoom in far enough, you can even 
see the blocky pixels that make up the image. At 400 percent zoom, notice 
how the image in Figure 6-1 is made of large squares. However, when you 
just look at most bitmap images at actual size, you don’t even see the pixels.
 
Figure 6-1: 
A bitmap 
image is 
created 
from pixels.
 
Bitmaps are a great way to display photographs and apply effects to text. 
When you paint or create detailed graphics, you frequently use bitmaps. 
However, remember that you can lose some quality if you scale (change the 
size of) the image. Resizing the small pixels causes the image to lose defini-
tion and quality. Most problems occur when an image is enlarged. Common 
kinds of bitmap files are JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, and PICT. You can read more 
about bitmaps in Book IV.
Discovering vector graphics
A vector image (or graphic or drawing) is very different from a bitmap image. 
A vector image is created by a series of mathematical calculations or code 
that describes how the image should be formed. These calculations tell the 
computer how the lines should display and render on the page.

Book I
Chapter 6
Handling Graphics, 
Paths, Text, 
and Fonts
Using Graphics in Your Documents
55
Vector images are usually smaller in file size than bitmap graphics. This is 
because the information that’s required to make the calculations that create 
the vector image are usually smaller in file size than the information that it 
takes to make up each pixel of a bitmap. Compression can lessen a bitmap’s 
file size, but they’re usually larger and slower to display.
For this reason and also because vectors are great when it comes to scaling 
an image, as shown in Figure 6-2, these graphics are well suited for the Web.
 
Figure 6-2: 
A vector 
image is 
smooth at 
any zoom 
level.
 
Scaling is easy to do when you’re using vectors because the program needs 
to modify the calculations only slightly to make the image larger or smaller. 
This means the file size won’t change, and the scaling is very quick. You can 
scale the image on a Web page to fill the browser window, whatever size it 
is, or make the image huge for a large banner. The quality won’t degrade, 
and the file size remains the same.
Vectors aren’t always perfect for the Web though. A bitmap is frequently the 
best way to display a photograph because if you change a bitmap image into 
a vector drawing (which is possible through the use of tools), you lose too 
much of the photograph’s detail for many purposes. Also, certain effects, 
such as drop shadows, are best displayed as a bitmap image.

Working with Paths and Strokes
56
Working with Paths and Strokes
Paths are the vector lines and outlines that you create in a document. You 
can use paths to outline an image, separate areas of text, or be part of an 
illustration you create. You typically make paths with a Line tool or a Pen 
tool, or the shape tools. You can use these tools to create paths of differ-
ent shapes and sizes. You also can use tools to modify the color and size of 
strokes (the actual line that makes up a path).
You can use paths to create clipping paths and paths for text. Clipping paths 
are used to mask (or hide) elements on a page. You define that mask with 
paths to create a shape for that area you need to hide. Clipping paths can 
even be saved in a file and imported into a different design pattern. A common 
workflow is to create an image in Photoshop CS4 with a clipping path and 
import that image into InDesign. InDesign can interpret the clipping path, 
meaning that you could remove the area you want to mask automatically.
When you want to create text that flows along a path, begin by creating a 
new path and then use the Type On a Path tool to type text directly onto 
that path. For example, in Illustrator, you’d create a path with the Pen tool 
and then select the Type On a Path tool in the toolbox. If you click the tool 
on the path you created, you can type new text along that path.
A stroke is the color, width, and style of the line that makes up the path you 
create. You might draw a line with the Pen tool, and the line making up that 
path is the stroke. However, that path can also have no stroke (represented 
as a diagonal line in the Tools panel), which means you won’t see the path 
itself. However, you may see a color or pattern filling that stroke (the fill), as 
shown in Figure 6-3.
 
Figure 6-3: 
This path 
has a fill but 
no stroke 
applied to it.
 
You can change the color, width, style (or type), and shape of a stroke with 
controls and tools in the toolbox and the Stroke panel in Illustrator and 
InDesign. This means that you can create dashed or solid strokes of different 
patterns that are wide or narrow. Some strokes are shown in Figure 6-4.

Adding Text
You may add text to your projects for different reasons. Text is frequently 
used to educate and inform people who read it, and this kind of document is 
a lot different from those that use text for artistic purposes only. For exam-
ple, if you’re creating an article, you may place the text in columns on the 
page with a large title at the top. Other times, you may use text as a creative 
element, or even as an object instead of a letter. Alternatively, you may be 
laying out a Web page and use the text for both a creative element in an ani-
mation and the content on pages that make up the Web site.
You can add text to a document by using the Text tool or by importing the 
text from another source, such as Microsoft Word. You can create a single 
line of text in a text field, or large blocks of text with or without columns. 
Text fields can be rotated and resized, and you can change the color, font 
face, orientation, and character size of the text.
Text can also be placed on a path, as we mention briefly in the previous sec-
tion, “Working with Paths and Strokes.” This allows you to add text to your 
documents in a different way because you can draw a path and have the text 
follow it. Paths are particularly useful for headings on a page, footers, and 
artistic works that use text as one of the elements.
Using fonts
A font refers to the typeface of a set of characters. You can set the font to be 
a number of sizes, such as a miniscule size of 2 or a gargantuan size of 200. 
Fonts are given names, such as Times New Roman or Comic Sans.

Adding Text
58
You may also hear about glyphs, which refers to an actual character itself. 
For example, S is a glyph. A set of glyphs makes up a font. You can view 
glyphs in the Glyph panel in Illustrator (choose Window➪Type➪Glyphs), 
which is especially useful when you’re using fonts like Wingdings that are 
made of pictures instead of letters and numbers.
What fonts you use can make a huge difference to the look, feel, and style of 
your documents. Whether you’re working on a layout for a magazine article 
or creating a digital piece of art, the kinds of fonts you use help the feel of 
the work.
Two major groupings for fonts exist, which are illustrated in Figure 6-5:
 
✦ Serif: Characters have a small line that intersects the end of each line in 
a character, such as the feet on “rif” in serif.
 
✦ Sans-serif: Characters don’t have the small intersecting lines at the end 
of a line in a character.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Serif and 
sans-serif 
fonts.
 
Sometimes sans-serif fonts feel more modern, whereas serif sometimes 
looks more historical, formal, or literary. (This, of course, is all a matter of 
opinion.) Take a moment to look around the Web and how text is used in 
your books, magazines, advertisements, and even the newspaper. How text 
is commonly used greatly affects how other people view your work and find 
the overall feel of it. Finding an appropriate font is sometimes a challenging 
design task, but it can also be fun.
Discovering types of fonts
Although you can find a gadzillion fonts for free on the Internet, be con-
cerned about the quality of your finished product. Typically, those in 
the professional graphics industry use PostScript fonts, and preferably 
OpenType fonts, which are more reliable when printing, as compared to 
TrueType fonts, which may reflow when outputting to different resolutions.
TrueType
 
 Like other digital typefaces, the TrueType font file contains information, such 
as outlines, hinting instructions, and character mappings (which characters 

Book I
Chapter 6
Handling Graphics, 
Paths, Text, 
and Fonts
Adding Text
59
are included in the font). Available for both the Mac and Windows formats, 
there are slight differences in the TrueType fonts designed for each OS; 
therefore, Mac and Windows users can’t share TrueType fonts.
PostScript (Type 1)
 
 PostScript is a scalable font system that’s compatible with PostScript print-
ers; it allows users to see fonts on the screen the same way they’d be 
printed. Type 1 font files consist of two files — a screen font with bitmap 
information for on-screen display and a file with outline information for 
printing. For high-end printing, both parts of the Type 1 font files (Printer 
and Screen fonts) must be included with the file. Due to differences in their 
structure, Mac and Windows PostScript Type 1 fonts aren’t cross-platform 
compatible.
OpenType
 
 OpenType is font technology that was created in a joint effort between 
Adobe and Microsoft and is an extension of the TrueType font format that 
can also contain PostScript data. OpenType fonts are cross-platform — the 
same font file works under both Macintosh and Windows operating systems. 
This digital type format offers extended character sets and more advanced 
typographic controls. Like TrueType, a single file contains all the outline, 
metric, and bitmap data for an OpenType font. Although any program that 
supports TrueType fonts can use OpenType fonts, not all non-Adobe pro-
grams can access the full features of the OpenType font format. You can find 
the symbols in the Font menus of many of the CS4 programs representing 
the type of font.
Using text and fonts on the Web
Using text and fonts on the Web is a difficult task at times. When you use 
fonts in a Web page, system fonts are used to display text. You’ll usually 
specify a font or a group of fonts to use on each page, and the fonts that are 
installed on the visitor’s computer are used to display the text. The problem 
arises if you use (or want to use) fonts that aren’t installed on the visitor’s 
computer. If you choose to use the Papyrus font and the visitor doesn’t have 
that font, a different font is substituted and the page looks completely differ-
ent as a result.
When you’re using Dreamweaver to create Web sites, you can set up a set 
of fonts that you want to use on each page. These fonts are similar in how 
they look, and if one of the fonts isn’t available, the next font is used instead. 
Among the fonts in the set, at least one of them should be installed on the 
visitor’s computer. This ensures that even if your pages will look very simi-
lar to your original layout.

The Fundamentals of Page Layout
60
 
You can use Photoshop and Illustrator to create an image using any font 
installed on your computer and then save that image for the Web (choose 
File➪Save for Web & Devices). Then you can place that image in your Web page 
with Dreamweaver. This option is best used for small amounts of text — say, for 
buttons in a navigation bar, headings to separate areas of text, or a customized 
banner at the top of your Web page.
The Fundamentals of Page Layout
Page layout incorporates the many elements that we discuss in previous sec-
tions of this chapter, mainly text and images (and sometimes other forms 
of multimedia), to create a design on a page. When you’re creating a page 
design, you must think about how people view a layout, such as how the eye 
moves across the page to take in the flow of information. Also consider how 
the elements are arranged and how much empty space is around them.
Two main kinds of page layout are discussed in this book: print and Web 
layouts. Both of these formats require you to work with many of the same 
elements.
Image manipulation for the Web is frequently done with Photoshop. 
Photoshop is also the standard program for manipulating and correcting 
images intended for print. You can even design a page for print, but also put 
it online by using InDesign’s Export XHTML/Dreamweaver command.
However, you have to make certain considerations when you put something 
online. Navigation, usability, file size, dimensions, and computer capabilities 
are considerations for the Web that aren’t a concern when you’re working 
for print. However, resolution, colors, and cropping (to name a few) are con-
siderations of someone designing a piece for print, which aren’t concerns for

Layout for print
When you design a page layout for print, you have to take into account the 
size and type of paper that will be used. Sometimes, you’ll create letterhead 
with certain elements on the page remaining the same, whereas other ele-
ments (the main content) differ from page to page. You can also create page 
layouts that serve as templates for a book and use particular elements repeat-
edly in varying ways throughout the pages (such as bullets or sidebars). Page 
size, font size, and image resolution are all important considerations in print.

On-screen image resolution is measured in pixels per inch (ppi), which refers 
to the number of pixels that are within one inch on-screen. The printed reso-
lution of an image is measured in dots per inch (dpi) — a dot of ink is printed 
for each pixel. A higher dpi means that the image is clearer with finer detail, 
which is very important for print. Printed images almost always use a higher 
resolution than on-screen images, so you may find that an image that is 4 x 
4 inches on-screen (at 72 ppi) prints out at less than 1 x 1 inch (at 300 dpi). 
Read more about resolution in Book IV, Chapter 6.
Templates are available for page layouts that take into consideration 
common dimensions of paper and help you lay out your content into a 
defined area. Many different kinds of templates are available online, and you 
can download them sometimes for free, but others are available for a small 
or modest fee depending on the template. For example, if you’re creating a 
brochure, you may have to think about where the page will be folded and 
how to orient your images and text so that they’re facing the correct way 
when the brochure is read.
A few things to think about when you’re laying out a page include the following:
 
✦ Use a grid and snapping-to-align elements whenever possible. If cer-
tain elements on your page aren’t aligned, you should have a good 
reason for this.
 
✦ The eye travels in the direction of the elements on the page. For 
example, if you have a picture of a person facing away from the center of 
a spread, the eye travels in that direction. Make sure that the eye travels 
to the important elements on the page.
 
✦ Divide your pages into thirds, which is the rule of thirds. Parts of your 
layout should fall into these three areas.
Web page layout
Layout for the Web is quite different from layout for print. However, many 
of the same issues arise in both print and Web layout, such as keeping your 
text legible and flowing across the page (or screen) in an intelligent way. In 
Web layouts, navigation and usability open up a few doors for things you 
should consider when planning a Web page:
 
✦ Usability: A usable site is accessible to most, if not all, of your visitors. 
This means that visitors can access your content easily because the text 
is legible, the file formats work on their computers, and they can find 
content on your site. Also, if the visitor has a challenge, such as a sight 
or reading disability, he or she can use software on the computer so that 
the site is read or described aloud.

The Fundamentals of Page Layout
62
 
✦ Size: File size should always be kept to a minimum, which may mean 
changing your layout to accommodate for this. If many parts of your 
design require large images, you may need to change the design com-
pletely to reduce your file size. Also, you need to design the page with 
monitors in mind. If a visitor has his or her monitor set to a resolution 
of 800 x 600, your site scrolls horizontally if it’s designed any larger than 
780 pixels wide. Most Web surfers dislike scrolling horizontally, so the 
dimensions of the visitor’s display should be considered when designing 
sites.
 
✦ Navigation: Users have to navigate between pages on your site. To do 
so, you need to create links to those pages by using buttons, text links, 
menus, and so on. Making that navigation easy to find and use takes 
some forethought and planning. Be sure that navigation is a big part of 
your plans when designing the layout of your site.
Not only do you have to think about usability and navigation, but you have 
to account for the different kinds of computers accessing the page and how 
people from all over the world may try to access your page. If you need your 
page to be universal, you may need to translate it into different languages 
and use different character sets. (This is true of print as well, if you’re 
designing a page that requires a special character set other than the ones 
you regularly use.)
Because you may be using multimedia (such as images and animation) 
alongside text, you’re constrained to the dimensions and color limitations of 
a computer monitor and have to think about both file size and scrolling.
There are many differences between preparing a layout for the Web and for 
print; however, you’ll find that you use many of the same tools for both, and 
a great deal of information crosses over between the two mediums.

Chapter 7: Using Color
In This Chapter
✓ Discovering color modes
✓ Finding out about swatches
✓ Using color for print
✓ Using color on the Web
U
sing color in your documents is probably one of the most important 
considerations you can make in your projects. The colors you use, 
the mode that you use them in, and even the way you select colors make 
a difference in the way you create a document and the final output of that 
document. Even though you can create a document that looks the same on 
a monitor in different color modes, how that file prints onto paper is a dif-
ferent matter. Color is a very broad subject, and in this chapter, you find out 
the basics of how color affects the projects you work on.
Figuring out what kinds of colors you’re using is important, and this deci-
sion is greatly determined by what kind of output you’ve planned for the 
document. Different color modes are appropriate for work for the Web and 
work that you’re having professionally printed. Monitors and printers have 
different modes for color, which means that you need to work with your 
files in different color modes (although you can change the mode after you 
start working on a file, if necessary). You may also find yourself in situations 
where very particular colors are required in your work. You may be working 
with specific colors that a company needs to match its logo, or creating an 
image that replicates how a building should be painted with specific colors 
of paint. You may need to use particular Pantone colors or color mixes, if 
not for the printing process, for the purpose of matching a client’s needs.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the different color modes and how to 
use them. You discover new terminology and how to find, mix, and add 
colors to your documents in the Creative Suite.
Looking at Color Modes and Channels
Several different color modes are available for use in the Creative Suite 
applications. When you start a new document in Photoshop and Illustrator, 
you can choose the color mode you want to work in. In fact, both Photoshop 
and Illustrator help you by allowing you to choose the color mode in the 

Looking at Color Modes and Channels
64
New Document dialog box. The choice you make affects how colors are cre-
ated. You can change your color mode later by choosing File➪Document 
Color Mode in Illustrator or Image➪Mode in Photoshop. If you’re working 
with print, generally you use CMYK mode. If you’re working on files that are 
to be displayed on a monitor, RGB is the choice.
Using RGB
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is the color mode used for on-screen presentation, 
such as an image displayed on the Web or a broadcast design for TV. Each 
of the colors displayed on-screen has a certain level (between 0 and 100 
percent) of red, green, and blue to create the color. In a Color panel, you can 
either use sliders to set the level in values, as shown in Figure 7-1, or you can 
enter a percentage into a text field (such as in CMYK color mode).
 
Figure 7-1: 
Creating 
colors with

mode.
 
 
Note the exclamation point on the color panel, which indicates that this 
color wouldn’t reproduce correctly in CMYK mode. You can click the CMYK 
warning exclamation point to convert to a color that’s suitable for the CMYK 
gamut. Color is discussed in the Book IV, Chapter 3, including more details 
about how you can adjust the Color Settings dialog box.
When you create a Web page, the color is represented as a hexadecimal 
number. A hexadecimal number starts with a pound sign (#) followed by 
three pairs of letters and numbers (A–F and 0–9) — the first pair for red, 
the second pair for green, and the last pair for blue. The lowest value (the 
least amount of the color) in a hexadecimal number is 0 (zero), and the 
highest value (the greatest amount of the color) is F. For example, #000000 
is black, #FFFFFF is white, #FF0000 is red, and #CCCCCC is a light gray. 
To see what a particular hexadecimal color looks like, go to Webmonkey at 
www.webmonkey.com/reference/Color_Charts.
Working with CMYK
The RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color mode is the color standard for monitors 
and the Web, and CMYK — Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (or Black) — is 
the standard color mode for print media, particularly in commercial printing 
such as that done by a service provider.

Book I
Chapter 7
Using Color
Looking at Color Modes and Channels

The CMYK color scheme is based on pigment (a substance used as coloring) 
color separation, and it describes how light reflects off pigments. When you 
work with this color mode, you create black by adding the maximum values 
of cyan, magenta, and yellow all at once. You can create different levels of 
gray by combining equal, but not maximum, amounts of cyan, magenta, and 
yellow. White is simply the absence of all color. Many color printers you find 
today work using the CMYK color model and can simulate almost any color 
by printing two colors very close to each other; however, some at-home 
desktop printer models made by Epson, Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Canon 
use their own color systems to print your work.
Saving in grayscale
You’ve seen a lot of grayscale so far because that’s how the pictures were 
printed in this book. Grayscale refers to when color images are displayed 
or printed in black and white. Grayscale refers to the different shades of 
gray that can be used when printing using only black ink on a white page. 
Halftone patterns are used to help simulate different color values. This is 
accomplished by adding dots to simulate shadows and gradients between 
colors. Halftone patterns are created when an image uses dots of varying 
diameter, or when an image uses many small dots in the same area to simu-
late different shades of gray.
Looking at color channels
When you work with an image in Photoshop, the image has at least one (but 
typically more) color channels. A color channel stores information about a 
particular color in a selected image. For example, an RGB image has three 
color channels: one that handles the reds (R), one for handling green infor-
mation (G), and the last for information about the blues (B). See Figure 7-2.
 
Figure 7-2:
This RGB 
file is 
created 
from a Red, 
Green, 
and Blue 
channel.
 

Choosing Colors
66
In addition to each of the color channels, you can have an alpha channel. 
An alpha channel can hold the transparency information about a particular 
image. If you’re working with a file format that supports transparency, you 
can add and use the alpha channel to save alpha information.
You can also use an alpha channel to save a selection. By choosing 
Select➪Save Selection in Photoshop, you create an alpha channel with your 
selection saved to it. You can choose Select➪Load Selection and choose the 
channel to reload your selection at any time.
In Photoshop, you can access the channels in your image by choosing Windows➪
Channels. When the Channels panel opens, you can toggle visibility of each 
icon by clicking the eye icon next to each channel (refer to Figure 7-2).
Choosing Colors
When you create a document, you may have to consider what colors you 
use, or you may have the freedom to use an unlimited number of colors. If 
you print your documents, you can choose a specific set of colors to use. 
You may be restricted to only the two colors in a company logo, or you may 
have to print in grayscale. So finding the colors you need to use in each pro-
gram is important and then figuring out how to access those colors repeat-
edly in a document saves you a great deal of time.
Using swatches
Swatches are a good way to choose a color, particularly when you intend 
to print the document. The Swatches panel in the Creative Suite programs 
contains colors and sometimes gradients. (The Swatches panel, as shown in 
Figure 7-3, is from Illustrator.) You can create libraries of swatches that con-
tain colors that you can use repeatedly across several documents.

 The 
Swatches 
panels are 
similar in 
most CS4 
applications. 
Click to open the panel menu.

Book I
Chapter 7
Using Color
Choosing Colors
67
You can choose libraries of swatches from the panel menu or you can load 
and save swatch libraries. You can customize a swatch library by adding or 
deleting colors.
Mixing colors
 
 A color mixer is found in the Color panel, and it helps you choose colors. 
You can use the Eyedropper tool to choose a color, or you can enter values 
for each hue or percentages if you prefer that instead. You can use one of 
several different color modes in the programs that you use, which offers you 
a lot of flexibility for all your projects.
Follow these steps to choose a color in a specified color mode:
 
1. In a program that has a Color panel, choose Window➪Color to open 
the Color panel (if it’s not open already).
 
 The Color panel is available in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.
 
2. Click the Color panel menu to choose a new color mode.
 
 Open this menu by clicking the arrow button in the upper-right corner of 
the Color panel.
 
3. Choose the RGB color mode from the panel menu that opens.
 
 The panel switches to RGB color mode.
 
4. In the Color panel, click either the Fill box (solid square) or the Stroke 
box (hollow square) to choose what color you want to change.
 
 If you click the Fill box, you can modify the color of a fill (the color 
inside a shape). If you click the Stroke box, you can modify the color of a 
stroke (the outline of a shape or a line).
 
5. Use the sliders in the Color panel to change the color values.
 
 You can also change the percentage values to the right of each slider.
 
6. After you choose a color that you’re happy with, return to your docu-
ment and create a new shape that uses that color.
 
Hold down the Shift key when adjusting any one-color slider, and the other 
color sliders adjust proportionally to provide you with various tints from 
your original.

Using Color on the Web
68
Using Color on the Web
In the past, you had to be very conscious of what colors you used on the 
Web. Some computer monitors were limited in the number of colors they 
could display. Nowadays, color monitors are much more advanced and can 
handle a full range of colors, so images on the Web are much more likely to 
be properly displayed.
 
It doesn’t have to do with color, but Macintosh and Windows computers 
usually display your work differently because of gamma differences on these 
machines. Generally speaking, colors on a Mac appear lighter, and colors on 
a PC look darker. You can account for this difference by making a Mac ver-
sion of your site, videos, and so on look darker so that both are the same (or 
you can make the Windows version lighter), but these changes aren’t usually 
necessary.
Even though most computers can handle a full range of colors, you may have 
to consider color limitations. If you’re designing a site specifically targeted 
at old computers or a certain user base, you may have to limit your colors 
to the 256 Web-safe colors, which means that any other colors used are 
approximated, which can look poor. If it’s likely that your site will be viewed 
by users with older computers, consider the following:
 
✦ Use a Web-safe palette of 216 colors to design your Web sites so 
that you specifically design with those older displays in mind and 
know what the pages will look like. This number is 216 instead of 256 
because the lower number is compatible with both Mac and Windows 
computers. This panel is usually called the Web-Safe Palette or Web-
Safe RGB, and you can access it from the Swatches panel menu in 
Photoshop and Illustrator.
 
✦ Avoid using gradients if possible because they use a wide range of 
colors (many unsupported in a limited Web panel).
 
✦ If a color is approximated because it can’t be handled by someone’s 
computer, that color is dithered — the computer tries to use two or 
more colors to achieve the color you specified, causing a typically dis-
pleasing granular appearance. So a limited number of colors can have 
a negative affect on an image; notice the granular appearance on what 
should be the shape of a face in Figure 7-4.
If you keep the preceding elements in mind, you’re ready to start designing 
for the Web! Remember also that you don’t have to worry about using the 
Web-safe palette of colors if you’re designing primarily for more up-to-date 
computers.

Chapter 8: Printing Documents
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding color and black-and-white printing
✓ Choosing a printer
✓ Outputting your work
You can print documents in many ways with Adobe Creative Suite 4. 
Similarly, you can print many different kinds of documents. You can 
create anything from a CD-ROM sticker to a 300-page book to a T-shirt iron-
on transfer using the programs you find in the Creative Suite. But whatever 
you’re working on, knowing the options that are available for printing your 
work is a good idea. Knowing the kinds of printers you can work with, what 
to buy (and from where) in order to use them, and how to save your work 
help improve the quality of the print job when you’ve finished your work.
Choosing Printers
When it comes to printers, you encounter hundreds of options at a great 
variety of prices. Printers can differ greatly when it comes to quality, cost 
of maintenance, and the speed at which the printer can print. Some inkjet 
printers excel at printing full-color photos but aren’t great at printing text; a 
low-end or medium-end laser printer may print black-and-white documents 
at good speed and quality, but you can’t print in color.
Using consumer printers
Currently, the most common type of consumer (home) printer is an inkjet 
printer. Inkjet printers work by spraying ink stored in cartridges onto a 
sheet of paper while it passes through the printer. This type of printer is 
common in households because it’s the least expensive type of color 
printer. It’s also versatile. You can walk into virtually any computer store 
and buy a color inkjet printer (which can print résumés, photos, and 
brochures) for a low price.
 
The one drawback of inkjets is that they can be expensive to maintain in the 
long run. Depending on how much you print, you may need to replace the 
black or color cartridges pretty often, which can get costly and quickly 
exceed the cost of the printer itself.

Buying a Printer
72
Looking at professional printers
Professional printers typically have a more rounded feature set compared to 
consumer printers. Professional printers can either be inkjet or laser print-
ers and can even perform multiple functions within the office. Not surpris-
ingly, printers that have several roles within the office are often referred to 
as multifunction or all-in-one printers and typically also include scanning, 
photocopying, or faxing capabilities in addition to printing. These all-in-one 
units are great for small offices and home offices because they save the 
consumer some money while providing access to a variety of useful tools.
Laser printers have several benefits: They typically produce a higher quality 
printout and print pages faster than inkjet printers, as well as produce a 
clean, professional-looking document. You can also print more pages per ink 
cartridge, saving you money in consumables.
Buying a Printer
Some common features to look for when purchasing a printer (either con-
sumer or professional) are
 
✦ Speed: Printers are rated in pages per minute (PPM). Low-end inkjet 
printers typically print about 12 or fewer PPM when printing black-and-
white pages. When printing color documents, the number of pages 
printed per minute will be less.
 
✦ Color: Almost all inkjet printers can print in color, but most laser 
printers print only in black and white. Color printers can be expensive 
to maintain because most inkjet printers have one cartridge for black 
ink and a second cartridge for colored inks. When one color runs out, 
you’re forced to replace the entire cartridge, or all the colors won’t look 
right when you print the document. Color laser printers are available, 
although they’re usually very expensive.
 
✦ Resolution: Similar to monitors, a printer’s quality can be rated in 
resolution. Higher resolution means images and text appear crisper. 
Low-end or older inkjet printers may print only a maximum of 600 dpi 
(dots per inch), which is more than fine for text but may be low if you 
want to print high-quality photographs.
 
✦ Connectivity: You can connect a printer to your computer in three 
ways. Older printers typically connect to your system using a parallel 
(36-pin) port, whereas newer printers often offer both parallel and USB 
(Universal Serial Bus) connections. The third way of connecting to a 
printer is by connecting a printer to your network, although this option 
is usually seen only on professional printers.
 
✦ Duplexing: Another feature to consider is duplexing. Duplexing is the 
ability to print on both sides of a sheet of paper without you manually 
flipping the piece of paper and placing it back in the paper tray.

Printing Your Work
When it comes to printing, countless options and settings can affect the final 
result of your document. Whether you’re printing banners, business cards, 
T-shirt iron-on transfers, or lost cat posters, you must be aware of several 
things, such as paper quality, printer quality, and ink usage. You also have 
to decide whether to print the documents yourself at home or take them to a 
professional printing business to get the work done.
Although RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is the color standard for the Web, CMYK 
(Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key [or Black]) is the standard in print. For 
information about using the RGB and CMYK color modes in the Creative 
Suite, see Chapter 7 of this minibook.
Choosing where and how to print
You can choose from several options when it comes to printing your files. 
You can take your digital files to a printing service provider, which is an 
establishment that prints electronic documents (such as FedEx Kinko’s), or 
even print the files yourself at home on your inkjet or laser printer. Each 
option has several advantages and disadvantages. Depending on how many 
copies and the number of colors, having your files printed professionally can 
be cost prohibitive. Having your files printed by a professional print house, 
however, almost always means the print quality will be much better than if 
the document was printed on a low-end inkjet printer.
Naturally, if you’re only printing flyers to distribute around the neighbor-
hood, you may not need high-quality output, and a home inkjet or laser 
printer would be more than adequate. However, it may be cheaper to 
print documents professionally than it is to print documents at home if 
you’re going to go through large amounts of black ink or perhaps one 
or two cartridges of toner.
If you’re using an inkjet printer, often you can get an average of 400 to 600 
pages of black text before you need to replace a cartridge; a laser printer 
prints around 2,500 to 4,000 pages before you need to purchase new toner. 
Simply using a laser printer can save hundreds of dollars a year, depending 
on the number of pages you need to print and whether you need to print in 
color. If you need to print in color, many color laser printers are available 
(although they can be expensive). Entry-level color laser printers can cost 
around $500; some high-end color laser printers can cost more than $10,000. 
In comparison, black-and-white laser printers can cost as little as about 
$100. So unless you plan on doing lots of printing, outsourcing your printing 
to a service provider may be the best solution.
 
The kind of printer you use (such as a commercial or PostScript printer, or a 
low-cost household inkjet) makes a great difference in the quality of output. 
Some of your illustrations or layouts will look a lot better when printed com-
mercially depending on what’s in your document. You can find more infor-
mation on PostScript features in Book II, Chapter 7 and Book III, Chapter 13.

Printing Your Work
74
Looking at paper
Before printing your documents, consider the type of paper that’s best for 
the job. If you’re printing on glossy paper, make sure that the paper works 
with your printer type. Although most glossy paper works fine in inkjet or 
laser printers, some brands or types of paper may not.
 
Always double-check paper when purchasing it to make sure that it won’t 
damage your printer. The kinds of printers supported by the type of paper 
will be listed on the paper’s packaging.
One benefit to using glossy paper is that it has a finish similar to photo 
paper finish, which can make your printouts appear to have a higher quality.
Using good paper can result in photos that have richer colors and show 
more detail. When purchasing printer paper, here are some important 
characteristics to look for:
 
✦ Brightness: Refers to how bright the paper is. Higher numbers mean the 
paper looks brighter and cleaner.
 
✦ Weight: Refers to how heavy the paper is. Higher weights mean a 
thicker, more durable piece of paper.
 
✦ Opacity: Refers to how translucent, or transparent, the paper is. If the 
paper is too thin, too much light can pass through it; also, it may be 
possible to see the ink through the other side of the page (which can be 
a problem if you want to print on both sides of the sheet). Opacity 
relates to weight, in that a heavier sheet of paper would be thicker and 
allow less light to pass through it.
 
✦ Texture: Refers to the smoothness or roughness of the surface of the 
paper. Texture can provide dramatic differences between inkjet and 
laser printers. Inkjet printers spray ink onto a page, so having a slightly 
textured surface to print on can be beneficial because the texture allows 
ink to dry somewhat faster and bleed a little less, making the finished 
product look a little sharper. When using a laser printer, the opposite is 
true. Having a smooth, flat surface for the toner to transfer onto pro-
duces better results.
Remember that you may not always print on 8.5-x-11-inch paper (also 
referred to as Letter or A4). Many printers also allow you to print onto enve-
lopes, labels, stickers, business cards, and even iron-on transfers. You can 
use iron-on transfers to create your own T-shirts with your company logo or 
shirts with your face on the front. Some newer printers even allow you to 
print directly onto the surface of a CD-ROM. You can even purchase small 
printers that were designed solely to print standard-sized photographs.

Chapter 8

75
Another important note is the difference in paper sizes globally. While the 
United States and Canada use inches to measure paper, the rest of the globe 
uses a metric system based on an ISO (International Organization for 
Standardization) standard.
The North American Letter format may be replaced by the ISO A4 format. 
The other differences between the U.S. and Canadian systems from the ISO is 
that the ISO paper sizes always follow a set ratio, whereas the U.S. and 
Canadian systems uses two different aspect ratios.
Saving files for a service provider
When working with a professional print service provider, make sure which 
file formats it’ll accept. Almost all print service providers will accept files 
created using an Adobe program (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Acrobat, 
and so on), as well as files created using QuarkXPress, CorelDRAW, or other 
professional-level programs. Also confirm what version and operating 
system the service provider will accept because it may be necessary to save 
your files so that they’re compatible with whichever version of software the 
service provider uses.
You may have to export your work as a different file format, such as PDF 
(Portable Document Format), if your service provider doesn’t accept native 
InDesign or QuarkXPress files. To create a PDF of your document, it’s best to 
choose File➪Print and select Postscript File from the Printer drop-down list, 
as shown in Figure 8-1.
 
Figure 8-1:

76
After you save a Postscript file, you can launch Adobe Distiller (which is in 
the Adobe Acrobat application folder that installed with the Creative Suite) 
and choose File➪Open to open your PostScript file. Distiller automatically 
converts the file to a PDF, based upon your present settings. Read more 
about PDF options in Book V, Chapter 2.
Printing at home
When you’re ready to print your documents, you can access the Print dialog 
box and then specify a number of settings depending on what kind of printer 
you’ve installed. For this example, Adobe Distiller is used.
Though you can simply save a Photoshop PDF from the regular Save menu, 
we take you through the steps of creating a PDF file from Photoshop’s Print 
dialog box. With the Print dialog box, you can take advantage of additional 
options that aren’t available in the Save menu, such as the ability to preview 
your printed document, scale your image, and apply color settings.
To print a file as a PDF from Photoshop CS4, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog box opens, as shown in Figures 8-2 and 8-3.
 
 The Print dialog box differs, depending on which program you’re using. 
In this dialog box, Photoshop allows you to change the scale of the 
image by entering a value in the Scale text box, or selecting and dragging 
a handle on the preview image on the left side.

nDesign CS4 is packed with great features that both new and experienced 
users are excited about. These new features are sure to save you lots of 
time and help you create more dynamic pieces directly in InDesign. In this 
chapter, you discover some of these features and find references to chapters 
within this minibook that you can go to for more details. This chapter doesn’t 
do justice to show the new features in a list format, so look for descriptions of 
many additional new features in relevant chapters throughout this minibook.
Placing and Tracking Your Images Better than Before
Want to know if your image is missing the latest version, or where it’s being 
used? You could always reference the Links panel for this, but in InDesign 
CS4, you can choose Window➪Links to see thumbnails of your images, as 
well as find important file information that was previously accessible only 
by opening the image.
You’ll love the Panel Options available by selecting the panel menu in 
the upper-right corner of the Links panel, as shown in Figure 1-1. Notice 
that the Links panel already has the ppi (pixels per inch) and larger-sized 
thumbnails already selected.

Placing and Tracking Your Images Better than Before

Links panel 
offers more 
information.
 
Also notice in Figure 1-1 that the Links panel is organized in such a way that 
it recognizes images that have been placed in several locations and groups 
them together to make locating and updating them a breeze.
In Figure 1-2, you see the available options that you can select. Notice the two 
columns — Show Column and Show in Link Info — which allow you to choose 
what information you see in the Links panel or just in the Link Info panel. 
This feature is exciting because it saves you hours of time and is a lot more 
helpful . . . especially if your naming convention for image files is difficult to 
interpret. Find out more about this new feature in Chapter 2 of this minibook.

Making Transforms Just Got Easier
Sure, you could always scale objects and rotate them in InDesign, but you 
have to admit that doing so was a little awkward at times. You might think 
you’re scaling an image, but you’re actually scaling the frame holding the 
image, or vice-versa. Not anymore! Adobe has made production easier by 
making the Transform tool more intuitive and by adding new keyboard 
shortcuts to speed up transforms. Find out more about the improved 
Transform tool in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
Guiding You to a Better Place
You have to see the new InDesign Guide to get the full impact of how help-
ful the guide and the cursor features are. You can take advantage of several 
guides and cursor features. My favorite is the improved cursor that displays 
[x,y] position, width/height, or rotation information while you reposition an 
object, as shown in Figure 1-3. Don’t worry; if you don’t like the cursor, you 
can turn it off in the InDesign Preferences dialog box.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Get details, 
such as 
the x,y 
coordinates, 
with the 
new cursor 
features.
 
If you look closely at Figure 1-3, you can see a guide at the top of both the 
image and the text — dubbed a smart guide. Smart object alignment allows 
for easy snapping to page item centers, edges, or page centers. In addition to 
snapping, smart guides dynamically draw to give feedback to the user as to 
which object you’re snapping. Smart guides already exist in Photoshop and 
Illustrator. Many people have trouble understanding them at first, but after 
giving them a try, most users agree that smart guides are extremely helpful 
when laying out objects on a page.

Guiding You to a Better Place
84
Included in the cool, helpful guides category is the Smart Dimensions fea-
ture. The Smart Dimensions feature activates when resizing, creating, or 
rotating page items. Smart Dimensions cause the width, height, or rotation 
of a page item to snap to the dimensions of other visible page items. Find out 
more about guides in Chapter 5 of this minibook.
 
You can now choose to delete all guides on a page (that are selectable) 
easily in InDesign CS4 by simply right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking 
(Mac) the ruler and choosing Delete All Guides. Note that if your ruler isn’t 
visible, press Ctrl+R (Windows) or Ô+R (Mac) to make them visible. See 
Figure 1-4.

Cleaning Up as You Go!
Preflight is used in production to define the task of making sure that all ele-
ments are in order to complete a job as expected. Most of the time preflight 
refers to jobs that might travel from one site to another before being printed. 
Confusion between RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, 
Yellow, Black) as well as missing fonts and images can cause errors. Now 
you can track as you go to assure that everything’s in order. InDesign added 
a nifty little pop-up window in the lower left of the document window that 
can expand to the Preflight panel, as shown in Figure 1-5. The Preflight panel 
can help you keep track of your document as you work.

Selecting, Dropping, and Going with 
Multiple Placed Images
InDesign offers a great, new feature for placing images that you’ll want to try 
right away. With InDesign CS3, you could place multiple images at once, but 
now Adobe has gone even further by letting you define a space and have the 
pictures place themselves (evenly) within that area. If you want to try this 
right away, do the following:
 
1. Choose File➪Place.
 
 The Place dialog box appears.
 
2. Navigate to a folder that contains multiple images that you want to 
place and then select one image.
 
3. Hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) and click another image.
 
 You can select as many images as you want.
 
4. Click the Place button.
 
5. Hold down the Ctrl+Shift keys (Windows) or Ô+Shift (Mac) and draw a 
rectangle.
 
 When you release the mouse button, the images you selected are automati-
cally placed evenly in the rectangular area you drew, as shown in Figure 1-6.

Improving Integration with Flash
You can now export InDesign CS4 documents to a Flash (SWF) file.
Choose File➪Export and select Adobe Flash CS4 Pro (XFL) from the Format 
pop-up list. The Adobe Flash (SWF) dialog box allows you to set the output 
size, specify the pages to include, and make various conversion and com-
pression choices.

Chapter 2: Introducing 
InDesign CS4
In This Chapter
✓ Opening InDesign
✓ Creating new documents
✓ Looking at and setting up the workspace
✓ Creating your first publication
I
nDesign is one of the most sophisticated page layout programs available 
on the market. Not only can you create professional-looking documents, 
such as newsletters, books, and magazines, but you can integrate your 
documents with other Adobe applications. For example, you can create a 
document that includes hyperlinks and video and export it to PDF, or you 
can export XML (Extensible Markup Language) from InDesign and import 
the XML into Dreamweaver to create Web pages. You can even import (or 
place) an InDesign document into an InDesign document!
As powerful of an application InDesign is, you’d think it’d be difficult to use, 
but it really isn’t. This minibook shows you how to use InDesign to make 
creative page layouts. In this chapter, you discover the InDesign interface 
and start your first publication.
Getting Started with InDesign CS4
InDesign creates multiple page layouts that include type, graphics (such as 
fills and strokes), and images. The InDesign document you see in Figure 2-1 
includes elements from Adobe Illustrator (logos) and Photoshop (images). 
If this file was to be exported as a PDF, it could include video and even Flash 
files.
In the following sections, you get familiar with creating and opening docu-
ments in InDesign. Through Chapters 3–9 in this minibook, you discover 
how to add various elements to your pages.

Creating a new publication
After you launch InDesign, you can create a new InDesign document (also 
referred to as a publication). Just follow these steps to create a new publication:
 
1. Choose File➪New➪Document.
 
 The New Document dialog box opens.
 
2. Enter a value for the number of pages for the document in the Number 
of Pages text field.
 
 This value can be between 1 and 9999. If you want a text frame on the 
master page, select the Master Text Frame check box.
 
 You can discover more about text frames in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
 
3. For this example, select the Facing Pages check box to have the pages 
arranged as spreads.
 
 With this option selected, the pages in your document are arranged 
in pairs, so you have spreads, which are facing or adjacent pages in a 
layout. For example, you’d select this option if you’re creating a publica-
tion that will be arranged like a book. If you deselect this option, pages 
are arranged individually.
 
4. Choose a page size for the document from the Page Size drop-down 
list, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
 The page size should be set to the size of paper you intend to print on 
or display the content at. The Width and Height values below this drop-
down list change, depending on the size you choose.

Book II
Chapter 2

InDesign CS4

 The Page Size drop-down list now includes resolution sizes (such as 800 
x 600). This is helpful if you’re planning to export the document as an 
interactive PDF or to Dreamweaver to create a Web page.
 
5. Choose Portrait (vertical) or Landscape (horizontal) orientation for the 
orientation of the pages throughout the document.
 
 Click the button on the left for Portrait or the button on the right for 
Landscape. A portrait layout is narrow and tall whereas a landscape 
layout is short and wide.
 
6. Choose a number for the columns on the page.
 
 This step sets guides for columns where you plan to input text. You can 
also enter a value in the Gutter field (the gutter is the space in between 
each of the columns). For more information about using columns in page 
layout, see Chapter 5 of this minibook.
 
7. Choose values for the page margins.
 
 Notice the Make All Settings the Same button in the middle of the four 
text fields where you enter the margin values. Click this button to set all 
margins to the same value.
 
 If you see Top, Bottom, Inside, and Outside, you’re specifying margins 
for a page layout that has facing pages. (The Facing Pages check box 
is selected in the dialog box.) If you see Top, Bottom, Left, and Right, 
you’re creating a page layout without facing pages. The inside margins 
refer to the margins at the middle of the spread, and the outside margins 
refer to the outer left and right margins. You can set the Inside setting to 
accommodate the binding of a book.
 
 If you use the same settings over and over, saving those settings as a 
preset is a good idea. Click the Save Preset button in the New Document 
dialog box after making your settings (before you click OK). Enter a 
name for the preset and then click OK. After you save your settings, you 
can select the settings from the Document Preset drop-down list (see 
the top of Figure 2-2) whenever you create a new document.
 
8. When you’re finished, click OK.
 
 After you click OK in the New Document dialog box, the new document 
is created with the settings you just specified.
 
 Margins, columns, orientation, and page size are discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 5 of this minibook.

Opening an existing publication
You may have InDesign files on your hard drive that you created or have 
saved from another source. To open existing InDesign documents (files that 
end with .indd), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Open.
 
 The Open dialog box appears.
 
2. Browse through your hard drive and select a file to open.
 
 Select a file by clicking the document’s title. To select more than one 
document, press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) while you click the filenames.
 
3. Click the Open button to open the file.
 
 The file opens in the workspace.

Looking at the document setup
If you need to change the size of your pages or the number of pages in a doc-
ument that’s already open in the workspace, you can make those changes 
in the Document Setup dialog box. To access and modify settings in the 
Document Setup dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Document Setup.
 
 The Document Setup dialog box opens.
 
 Note: You can change the value in the Number of Pages text field if you 
need the number of pages in your document to be greater or less than 
the current value.
 
 The number of pages in your document updates after you close 
this dialog box. You can also change this number later by choosing 
Layout➪Pages➪Insert Pages or by using the Pages panel.
 
2. Select a new option from the Page Size drop-down list or manually enter 
values into the Width and Height text fields to change the page size.
 
 You can also click the up and down arrows in the Width and Height text 
fields to choose a new value.
 
3. Click the Portrait or Landscape button to change the page 
orientation.
 
 The page orientation updates in the workspace after you exit this 
dialog box.
 
4. Click OK when you’re finished changing your document setup.
 
 The modifications are applied to the currently open document.
Touring the Workspace
Just like the other applications in the CS4 Suite, InDesign has a standardized 
layout. Using panels that can be docked and a single row Tools panel, you 
can keep much more space open in your work area.
The InDesign workspace, or user interface, is designed to be intuitive and 
efficient. You’ll use several panels over and over again, so it’s a good idea 
to keep them accessible. Many of these panels are already docked off to 
the right in the default user workspace. Figure 2-3 shows how the InDesign 
workspace layout looks on a Macintosh. The Windows workspace is slightly 
different from the Macintosh version. You’ll notice a difference in the main 
menu bar.

Here are the elements that create the InDesign workspace:
 
✦ Page: The main area of the InDesign workspace is a page. A page is the 
area that’s printed or exported when you’re finished making a layout.
 
✦ Master page: You can define how certain text elements and graphics 
appear in an entire document (or just portions of it) by using a master 
page. A master page is a lot like a template for your document because 
you can reuse elements throughout the pages. For example, if you have 
an element you want on each page (such as page numbering), you 
can create it on the master page. If you need to change an element on 
the master page, you can change it at any time, and your changes are 
reflected on every page that the master page is applied to.
 
✦ Spread: A spread refers to a set of two (or more) facing pages. You usu-
ally see spreads like these in magazines and books when you open them 
and a design spreads across both pages.

Book II
Chapter 2

InDesign CS4

95
 
✦ Pasteboard: The pasteboard is the area around the page (and actually 
includes the page or spread as well). You can use the pasteboard to 
store content until you’re ready to lay it out on the page or the spread 
you’re working on. Pasteboards aren’t shared between pages or spreads. 
For example, if you have certain elements placed on a pasteboard for 
pages 4 and 5, you can’t access these elements when you’re working on 
pages 8 and 9.
Tools
The Tools panel is where you find tools to edit, manipulate, or select ele-
ments in your document. Simply use your cursor and click a tool to select 
it. See Figure 2-4 for the default Tools panel layout.
 
If you decide that a single row of tools just isn’t for you, you can go back 
to an older version’s Tools panel by clicking the gray bar at the top of the 
Tools panel. If you want to relocate the tools, click the silver bar at the top 
of the tools and drag to a new location.
You can find out more about these tools and how to use them in the related 
chapters of this minibook. For example, we discuss the drawing tools in 
Chapter 3 of this minibook.
With the tools in the Tools panel, you can
 
✦ Create stunning new content on a page using drawing, frame, and text 
tools.
 
✦ Select existing content on a page to move or edit.
 
✦ View the page in different ways by moving (panning) and magnifying the 
page or spread.
 
✦ Edit existing objects, such as shapes, lines, and text. Use the Selection 
tool to select existing objects so that you can change them.
When a tool has a small arrow next to the button’s icon, more tools are 
hiding behind it. When you click the tool and hold the mouse button 
down, a menu opens that shows you other available tools. Just move the 
mouse down this menu and release the button when the tool you want is 
highlighted.

Menus
The menus in the main menu bar are used to access some of the main com-
mands and control the user interface of InDesign. They also allow you to 
open and close panels used to edit and make settings for the publication.
InDesign menu commands, such as New, Open, and Save, are similar to most 
other applications you’re probably familiar with. The InDesign menus also 
include commands that are especially used for page layout, such as Insert 
with Placeholder Text. For more information on using menus, see Book I, 
Chapter 2. Remember to refer to the common commands and shortcuts that 
are also detailed in that chapter.
The InDesign main menu has the following options:
 
✦ File: This menu includes some of the basic commands to create, open, 
and save documents. It also includes the Place command to import new 
content and many options to control document settings, exporting docu-
ments, and printing.
 
✦ Edit: You can access many commands for editing and controlling selec-
tion in this menu — such as copying and keyboard shortcuts. The 
Dictionary and spell check are found in this menu, too.
 
✦ Layout: This menu allows you to create guides. These options help you 
lay elements on the page accurately and properly aligned. The menu 
also allows you to navigate through the document’s pages and spreads.

✦ Type: This menu allows you to select fonts and control characters in the 
layout. You can access the many settings related to text in this menu, 
which opens the associated panel where you make the changes.
 
✦ Object: You can modify the look and placement of objects on the page 
with this menu. What options are available in this menu depend on what 
you’ve selected in the workspace, such as a text field or an image.
 
✦ Table: This menu enables you to create, set up, modify, and control 
tables on the page.
 
✦ View: You can modify the view of the page from this menu, including 
zooming in and out, as well as work with guides, rulers, or grids to help 
you lay out elements.
 
✦ Window: Use this menu to open and close panels or switch between 
open documents.
 
✦ Help: This menu is where you can access the Help documents for 
InDesign and configure any plug-ins you have installed.
Panels
In the default layout, you see a large area for the document, typically 
referred to as the page. To the right of the page are several panels that 
snap (are docked) to the edge of the workspace. Panels are used to control 
the publication and edit elements on your pages. Docked panels are panels 
attached to the edge of the user interface. Panels can be maximized and min-
imized away from the main work area, moved around, or closed altogether.
To expand a panel, you can simply click the panel name, and it automatically 
expands. The magic of this improved panel system is that the panels you 
expand are automatically collapsed again when a different panel is selected.
If you’d rather work with all panels expanded, simply click the left-facing 
double-arrows in the gray bar above the panels. You can collapse all the 
panels again by clicking the right facing double-arrows in the gray bar above 
the expanded panels.
Even though some of the InDesign panels perform different functions, similar 
panels are grouped together depending on what they’re used for. You can 
change the groupings by clicking and dragging a panel’s tab into another 
grouping.
Some panels work intelligently when you’re manipulating content on an 
InDesign page. If you work with a particular element, for example, the asso-
ciated panel is activated. Throughout Chapters 3–9 of this minibook, you 
discover these specific panels as you create layouts. For now, we briefly 
show you two of the general InDesign panels: the Control panel and the 
Pages panel.

Touring the Workspace
98
Control panel
The Control panel is used to edit just about any element in InDesign, as 
shown for the Type tool in Figure 2-5. This panel is context sensitive, so it 
changes depending on what you’ve selected on a page. For example, if you 
have text selected on the page, the Control panel displays options allowing 
you to edit the text. If you have a shape selected, it displays options allowing 
you to modify the shape.
 
Figure 2-5: 
The Control 
panel as 
it appears 
when the 
Type tool is

Figure 2-6 shows the Control panel when a stroke is selected. The panel 
menu allows you to select specific stroke options.

Pages panel
You can control pages by using the Pages panel, as shown in Figure 2-7. This 
panel allows you to arrange, add, and delete pages in your document. You 
can also navigate among pages with this panel, which we discuss further in 
Chapter 5 of this minibook.
 
You can now add and delete pages by choosing Layout➪Pages, and even use a 
keyboard shortcut to add pages, Shift+Ctrl+P (Windows) or Ô+Shift+P (Mac).

You can hide all the open panels (including the Control panel) by press-
ing the Tab key; press Tab for them to return to view. In InDesign CS4, you 
can leave the tools and panels hidden and access them when you want by 
moving your cursor to the left or right side of the work area. Pause when 
you see a tinted vertical gray bar appear, and the tools or panels (depending 
upon which side of the workspace you’re in) reappear! By the way, they go 
away again after you leave the area.
You can navigate through the document’s pages by using the left and right 
arrow buttons on either side of the page number. You can manually enter 
a value into the magnification text field and press Enter, or choose a preset 
value from the drop-down list.
Contextual menus
Contextual menus (or context menus) are menus that pop up when you right-
click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the mouse. Contextual menus change 
depending on what you click. If you don’t have any elements selected, the 
contextual menu opens for the overall InDesign document, allowing you to 
select options, such as Zoom, Paste, Rulers, and Guides. If you have an ele-
ment selected, your options include transforming, modifying, or editing the 
object.

Setting Up the Workspace

Contextual menus are context sensitive (hence the name!). Remember to 
select an element on the page before you right-click to open the contextual 
menu. If you don’t select the object first, the menu is for the document 
instead of for the object.
You can find out more about editing and transforming elements in Chapters 
3 and 4 of this minibook.
Setting Up the Workspace
Workspace settings are important to know about because they help you 
create quality page layouts. Overall document settings enable you to show 
grids or use guides that help you align elements on the page. Grids and 
guidelines are pretty much the same thing, except that grids are designed to 
repeat across the page and be a specified distance apart. Neither guides nor 
grids print when you print your document.
Showing and hiding grids and guides
Use grids when you need to align elements to the overall document. 
Elements in your layout can snap to a grid, which can help you align several 
elements or accurately space objects apart from each other. Guides can be 
placed anywhere on the page (and pasteboard) and are used to accurately 
position objects in your layout. Guides are different from grids, which can’t 
be freely placed just anywhere on the page. Objects can snap to guides just 
like they can snap to a grid.
The document grid is used for aligning elements on the page, and the baseline 
grid is used for aligning columns of text. To show the document grid, choose 
View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Document Grid; to show the baseline grid, 
choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Baseline Grid. You can immediately see 
the difference between these two kinds of grids. After you’re done viewing 
grids, you can remove the grids by choosing View➪Grids & Guides➪Hide 
Document Grid or View➪Grids & Guides➪Hide Baseline Grid.
Figure 2-8 shows what grids look like on a page.
 
To snap objects to a guide or the document grid, you must have snapping 
enabled. To enable snapping, choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Snap to Guides 
or View➪Grids & Guides➪Snap to Document Grid.

To create a guide and show or hide guides, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that rulers are visible by choosing View➪Show Rulers.
 
 Rulers appear in the workspace. If you already have rulers visible, the 
option View➪Hide Rulers is in the View menu. Do not hide the rulers.
 
2. Move the cursor to a horizontal or vertical ruler.
 
 Make sure that your cursor is over a ruler.
 
3. Click the ruler and drag the mouse toward the page.
 
 A ruler guide shows on the page as a line.
 
4. Release the mouse where you want the guide.
 
 You just created a ruler guide!
 
5. To hide the guide, choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Hide Guides.
 
 This step hides the guide you created, but it doesn’t delete it. You can 
make the guide reappear easily in the next step.
 
6. To see the guide again, choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Guides.
 
 The guide you created is shown on the page again.
You can find out more about the different kinds of guides and how to use 
them in page layout in Chapter 5 of this minibook.

You can control the color of the guides and grid in your preferences. 
Access the preferences by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Grids (Windows) 
or InDesign➪Preferences➪Grids (Mac). When the Preferences dialog box 
opens, you can change the color and spacing of the lines. Click Guides & 
Pasteboards in the list on the left to change the color settings for guides.
Snapping to a grid or a guide
You can have elements on the page snap to a grid or a guide. Grid or guide 
snapping is very useful so that you don’t have to eyeball the alignment of 
several elements to one another, because they’re precisely aligned to a grid 
or guide. In fact, grids and guides are fairly useless unless you have elements 
snap to them! To make sure that this setting is enabled, choose View➪Grids 
& Guides➪Snap to Document Grid or View➪Grids & Guides➪Snap to Guides.
Using the new smart guides
Give yourself an added hand when aligning objects on your InDesign page 
with Smart Guides. Illustrator and Photoshop users may be familiar with 
these interactive guides, but if you’re not, read on to discover how you can 
take advantage of them.
You can experiment with this new feature by creating two objects on an 
InDesign document. It doesn’t matter which object or shape, any will do!
With the Selection tool, click and drag one of the objects in a circular motion 
around the other. You’ll notice guides appear and disappear, indicating 
when you’re aligned either on the top, center, or bottom of the other object, 
as shown in Figure 2-9.

As a default, pink guides appear when you align with the center of the page, 
as shown in Figure 2-10.

You can view a print preview of your document by clicking the Preview 
Mode button at the very bottom of the Tools panel. When you click this 
button, all the object bounding boxes, guides, and the grid disappear.
Saving a custom workspace
You can rearrange panels in InDesign in a particular order, layout, and 
quantity. You may seldom use particular panels that are open by default, or 
you may often use ones that are closed by default. Often times, you create 
a workspace that’s just right for you, and you don’t want to lose it after you 
shut down InDesign or your computer. Luckily, you can save your work-
space so that when you return to InDesign, you can use the same workspace 
again.
To save a custom workspace, follow these steps:
 
1. Have the InDesign workspace configured in the way you want to save it.
 
 This workspace will be saved as a custom workspace.
 
2. Choose Window➪Workspace➪New Workspace.
 
 The New Workspace dialog box opens.
 
3. Type a new name for the workspace into the Name text field.
 
 When you finish, this name is displayed in the workspaces menu.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 The custom workspace is saved.
To access your workspace, choose Window➪Workspace➪Your Workspace 
(where Your Workspace is the name you gave the workspace in Step 3).

Working with Publications
104
You can delete the workspace if you no longer want it saved. Simply choose 
Window➪Workspace➪Delete Workspace.
Working with Publications
After you’re comfortable getting around the InDesign workspace, you’re 
ready to begin working with a new document. After you’ve started working 
on a document, it’s important to find out how to import content from other 
programs and to save that document on your hard drive. A lot of the content 
you work with in InDesign is imported from other programs. Then the con-
tent is organized, modified, and integrated into a layout using InDesign. To 
begin, we show you the steps needed to import content and save new files.
We show you how to open new and existing documents earlier in the chap-
ter; refer to the sections, “Creating a new publication” and “Opening an exist-
ing publication.”
 
You may also be working with templates. Templates are layouts that you 
reuse by applying them to a document that requires a particular prede-
signed format. For example, a company may use a template for its official let-
terhead because every new letter requires the same page format and design. 
InDesign templates use the .indt file extension.
Importing new content
You can use many different kinds of content in an InDesign document 
because you can import many supported file types. InDesign enables you to 
import text, formatted tables, and graphics that help you create an effective 
layout. This ability makes integration with many different programs easy.
Follow these steps to import an image file into InDesign. (In this example, we 
import a bitmap graphic file.)
 
1. Choose File➪New➪Document.
 
 The New Document dialog box appears.
 
2. Review the settings and click OK.
 
 A new document opens. Feel free to alter the settings before you click 
the OK button, if necessary. You may want to change the Number of 
Pages setting or change the orientation of the pages, but it’s not neces-
sary to do so.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Place.
 
 The Place dialog box opens, enabling you to browse the contents of your 
hard drive for supported files. If you select the Show Import Options 
check box, another dialog box opens before the file imports. Leave this 
option deselected for now.

4. Click the file you want to import and then click the Open button.
 
 Certain files, such as a bitmap photo, graphic files, and PDFs, show a 
thumbnail preview at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
 When you click the Open button, the Place dialog box closes, and your 
cursor becomes an upside-down L.
 
5. Click the page where you want the upper-left corner of the imported 
file (for example, an image) to appear.
 
 The imported file is placed on the page.
 
In InDesign CS4, you can Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click (Mac) to place 
multiple files. After you select the images and click OK, each click places 
an image on the page, or you can hold down the Shift+Ctrl (Windows) or 
Shift+Ô (Mac) while dragging a rectangle to have all the selected images 
placed, spaced evenly, in a grid.
Note that when you’re placing multiple images, you can see a thumbnail of 
each image before it’s placed. You can also scroll through the loaded images 
by pressing the left or right arrow keys.
For general information on importing and exporting in the Adobe Creative 
Suite, check out Book I, Chapter 5. For more information on importing different 
kinds of file formats, such as text, images, and PDFs, see Chapters 4 and 5 in this 
minibook.
You can also import different kinds of file formats, such as text and Excel 
tables.
Viewing content
You can view elements in several different ways on your document’s pages. 
Sometimes you need to see your drawings and images close up so that you 
can make precise edits, or you need to move the page around to see some-
thing that may extend past the workspace. InDesign offers the following 
ways to navigate your documents:
 
✦ Scroll bars: You can use the scroll bars to move the pages around. The 
scroll bars are located below and to the right of the pasteboard. Click a 
scroll bar handle and drag it left and right or up and down.
 
✦ Zoom: Zoom in or out from the document to increase or decrease the 
display of your document. Select the Zoom tool (the magnifying glass 
icon) from the Tools panel and click anywhere on the page to zoom in. 
Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key and click to zoom out.
 
✦ Hand tool: Use the Hand tool to move the page around. This tool is per-
haps the best and quickest way to move your pages around and navigate 
the document. Select the Hand tool by pressing the Spacebar and then 
click and drag to move around the pasteboard.

Working with Publications
106
Saving your publication
Even the best computers and applications fail from time to time, so you 
don’t want to lose your hard work unnecessarily. Saving your publication 
often is important so that you don’t lose any work if your computer or soft-
ware crashes, or the power goes out.
To save a file, choose File➪Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Ô+S (Mac).
Some people save different versions of their files. You may want to do this 
in case you want to revert back to an earlier version of the file. For example, 
you may decide to make a radical change to your page layout, but you want 
to keep an earlier version in case the radical change just doesn’t work out.
 
Remember to choose File➪Save before proceeding if you want the current 
document to save the revisions you’ve made since you last saved the file. All 
new additions to the document will be made in the new version of the file.
To save a new version of the current document and then continue working 
on the new document, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog box opens.
 
2. Choose the directory you want to save the file in.
 
3. In the File Name text field, enter a new name for the document.
 
 This step saves a new version of the file. Consider a naming scheme at 
this point. If your file is myLayout.indd, you might call it myLayout02.
indd to signify the second version of the file. Future files can then 
increase the number for each new version.
 
4. Click the Save button when you’re finished.
 
 This step saves the document in the chosen directory with a new name.
The File➪Save As command is also used for other means. You may want 
to save your design as a template. After you create the template, choose 
File➪Save As and then choose InDesign CS4 Template from the Save as Type 
(Windows) or Format (Mac) drop-down list.
You can also choose File➪Save a Copy. This command saves a copy of the 
current state of the document you’re working on with a new name, but you 
then continue working on the original document. Both commands are very 
useful for saving incremental versions of a project that you’re working on.
To find out more about working with files, go to Chapter 8 of this minibook.

Chapter 3: Drawing in InDesign
In This Chapter

✓ Drawing and editing shapes and paths
✓ Introducing corner effects
✓ Working with fills and layers
M
any of the tools that you find in the InDesign toolbox are used for 
drawing lines and shapes on a page. This means you have several 
different ways of creating interesting drawings for your publications. You 
can create anything from basic shapes to intricate drawings inside InDesign, 
instead of having to use a drawing program like Illustrator. Even though 
InDesign doesn’t replace Illustrator (see Book III), which has many more 
versatile drawing tools and options for creating intricate drawings, InDesign 
is adequate for simple drawing tasks. In this chapter, you discover how to 
use the most popular InDesign drawing tools and how to add colorful fills to 
your illustrations.
Getting Started with Drawing
When you’re creating a document, you may want drawn shapes and paths to 
be a part of the layout. For example, you may want to have a star shape for 
a yearbook page about a talent show or to run text along a path. Whatever it 
is you need to do, you can draw shapes and paths to get the job done.
Paths and shapes
Paths can take a few different formats. They can either be open or closed, 
with or without a stroke:
 
✦ Path: The outline of a shape or object. Paths can be closed and have no 
gaps, or they can be open like a line on the page. You can draw freeform 
paths, such as squiggles on a page, freely by hand.
 
✦ Stroke: A line style and thickness that you apply to a path. A stroke can 
look like a line or like an outline of a shape.
Figure 3-1 shows the different kinds of paths and strokes that you can 
create.

Getting Started with Drawing
108
 
Figure 3-1: 
Different 
kinds of 
paths and 
strokes 
created in 
InDesign.
 
Paths contain points where the direction of the path can change. (You can 
find out more about points in the following section, “Points and segments.”) 
You can make paths by using freeform drawing tools, such as the Pen or 
Pencil tools, or by using the basic shape tools, such as the Ellipse, Rectangle, 
Polygon, or Line tools.
The shape tools create paths in a predefined way so that you can make 
basic geometric shapes, such as a star or ellipse. All you need to do is select 
the shape tool, drag the cursor on the page, and the shape is automatically 
drawn. Creating shapes this way is a lot easier than trying to manually create 
them with the Pen or Pencil tool! See Figure 3-2 for shapes drawn with the 
shape tools found in the toolbox.
You can change shapes into freeform paths, like those drawn with the Pencil 
or Pen tools. Similarly, you can make freeform paths into basic shapes. 
Therefore, you don’t need to worry about which tool you initially choose.
 
We created the stars and starburst shown in Figure 3-2 by double-clicking 
the Polygon tool and changing the options. Read more about the Polygon 
tool in the “Drawing Shapes” section, later in this chapter.

Points and segments
Paths are made up of points and segments:
 
✦ Point: Where the path changes somehow, such as changing direction. 
There can be many points along a path that are joined with segments. 
Points are sometimes called anchor points. You can create two kinds of 
points:
 
• Corner points: These points have a straight line between them. 
Shapes like squares or stars have corner points.
 
• Curve points: These points are along a curved path. Circles or snak-
ing paths have lots of curve points.
 
✦ Segment: A line or curve connecting two points — kind of like connect 
the dots!
Figure 3-3 shows corner points and curve points joined together by segments.

Getting to Know the Tools of the Trade
The following subsections introduce you to tools that you’ll probably use 
the most when creating drawings in your publications. When you draw with 
these tools, you’re using strokes and fills to make designs. The following 
subsections show you what these common tools can do to help you create 
basic or complex illustrations in InDesign.
The Pencil tool
The Pencil tool is used to draw simple or complex shapes on a page. 
Because the Pencil tool is a freeform tool, you can freely drag the Pencil tool 
all over the page and create lines or shapes, instead of having them automat-
ically made for you like when you use basic shape tools. The Pencil tool is a 
very intuitive and easy tool to use. You find out how to use the pencil tool in 
the section “Drawing Freeform Paths,” later in this chapter.
The Pen tool
The Pen tool is used to create complex shapes on the page. The Pen tool 
works together with other tools, such as the Add, Remove, and Convert 
Point tools. The Pen tool works by adding and editing points along a path, 
thereby manipulating the segments that join them.
Drawing with the Pen tool isn’t easy at first. In fact, it takes many people 
a considerable amount of time to use this tool well. Don’t get frustrated if 
you don’t get used to it right away — the Pen tool can take some practice 
in order to get it to do what you want it to. You find out how to use the Pen 
tool in the “Drawing Freeform Paths” section, later in this chapter.
Basic shapes and frame shapes
Basic shapes are preformed shapes that you can add to a document by 
using tools in the toolbox. The basic shape tools include the Line, Rectangle, 
Ellipse, and Polygon tools.

Book II
Chapter 3
Drawing in InDesign
Drawing Shapes
111
You can also draw these shapes and turn them into frames (containers that 
hold content in your document) if you want. You can use a frame as a text 
frame or as a graphic frame used to hold pictures and text. Draw a basic 
shape and then convert the shape to a graphic or text frame by choosing 
Object➪Content➪Text or Object➪Content➪Graphic. We discuss graphic 
and text frames in more detail in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
 
The frame and shape tools look the same and can even act the same. Both 
can hold text and images, but look out! By default, shapes created with the 
Frame tool have a 1-pt black stroke around them. Many folks don’t see this 
on the screen but later discover that they have strokes around their text 
boxes when they print. Stick with the shape tools, and you’ll be fine.
Drawing Shapes
InDesign allows you to create basic shapes in your document. You can easily 
create a basic shape by following these steps:
 
1. Create a new document by choosing File➪New.
 
2. When the New Document dialog box appears, click OK.
 
 A new document opens.
 
3. Select the Rectangle tool in the toolbox.
 
4. Click anywhere in the page and drag the mouse diagonally.
 
 When the rectangle is the desired dimension, release the mouse button. 
You’ve created a rectangle.
That’s all you need to do to create a basic shape. You can also use these 
steps with the other basic shape tools (the Line, Ellipse, and Polygon tools) 
to create other basic shapes. To access the other basic shapes from the tool-
box, follow these steps:
 
 1. Click the Rectangle tool and hold down the mouse button.
 
 
 A menu with all the basic shapes opens.
 
2. Release the mouse button.
 
 The menu remains open, and you can mouse over the menu items. The 
menu items become highlighted when the mouse pointer is over each 
item.
 
3. Select a basic shape tool by clicking a highlighted menu item.
 
 The new basic shape tool is now active. Follow the preceding set of 
steps to create basic shapes using any of these tools.

Drawing Shapes
112
 
To draw a square shape, use the Rectangle tool and press the Shift key while 
you drag the mouse on the page. The sides of the shape are all drawn at 
the same length, so you get a perfect square. You can also use the Shift key 
with the Ellipse tool if you want a perfect circle — just hold down Shift while 
you’re using the Ellipse tool. Make sure that you release your mouse before 
the Shift key for this constrain shape trick to work!
Creating a shape with exact dimensions
Dragging on the page to create a shape is easy, but making a shape with pre-
cise dimensions using this method requires a few more steps. If you want to 
make a shape that’s a specific size, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Rectangle tool or the Ellipse tool.
 
 The tool is highlighted in the toolbox.
 
2. Click anywhere on the page but don’t drag the cursor.
 
 This point becomes the upper-right corner of your Rectangle or Ellipse 
bounding box (the rectangle that defines the object’s vertical and hori-
zontal dimensions). After you click to place your corner, the Rectangle 
or Ellipse dialog box appears.
 
3. In the Width and Height text fields, enter the dimensions you want the 
shape to be created at.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The shape is created on the page, with the upper-right corner at the 
place where you initially clicked the page.
Using the Polygon tool
A polygon is a shape that has many sides. For example, a square is a polygon 
with four sides, but the Polygon tool enables you to choose the number of 
sides you want for the polygon you create. When you’re using the Polygon 
tool, you may not want to create a shape with the default number of sides. 
You can change these settings before you start drawing the shape.
To customize the shape of a polygon, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Polygon tool in the toolbox by selecting the Rectangle tool 
and holding down the mouse button until the menu pops up.
 
2. Double-click the Polygon tool in the toolbox.
 
 The Polygon dialog box opens.
 
3. In the Number of Sides text field, enter the number of sides you want 
the new polygon to have.

Book II
Chapter 3
Drawing in InDesign

113
 
 If you want to create a star instead of a polygon, enter a number in the 
Star Inset text field for the percentage of the star inset you want the new 
shape to have.
 
 A higher percentage means the sides will be inset farther toward the 
center of the polygon, creating a star. If you want a regular polygon and 
not a star, enter 0 in the Star Inset text field. If you want a star, enter 
50%; for a starburst, enter 25%.
 
4. Click OK.
 
5. Move your cursor to the page and click and drag to create a new 
polygon or star.
 
 Your new polygon or star appears on the page.
Figure 3-4 shows what a few different polygons and stars with different 
settings look like.

Editing Basic Shapes
114
Editing Basic Shapes
You can edit basic shapes using several panels in InDesign. This means you 
can create original shapes and craft exactly the kind of design you require in 
your page layout. You aren’t stuck with the predetermined shapes, such as 
a square or oval. You can make these forms take on much more complicated 
or original shapes.
You can edit basic shapes in InDesign in only a few ways. You can edit 
shapes and manipulate their appearance in other ways. We cover some of 
these ways, such as editing fills, in the later section “Using Fills.”
Changing the size with the Transform panel
You can change the size of a shape by using the Transform panel. Here’s how:
 
 1. With the Selection tool (the tool that’s used to select objects), select 
the shape that you want to resize.
 
 
 When the shape is selected, a bounding box appears around it. You can 
see a selected shape in Figure 3-5.
 
Figure 3-5: 
A selected 
shape 
with the 
bounding 
box visible.
 
Selected object
Bounding box
 
2. Open the Transform panel by choosing Window➪Object and 
Layout➪Transform.
 
3. In the Transform panel that appears, enter different number values in 
the W and H fields to change the size of the shape.
 
 The shape automatically changes size on the page to the new size 
dimensions that you specify in the Transform panel.

Changing the size with the Free Transform tool
 
 Easily resize objects in InDesign with the Transform tool.
To resize a selected object with the Free Transform tool follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the object, and only the object that you want to resize, 
is selected.
 
 Group multiple objects together if you want to resize several objects 
simultaneously. Group objects by selecting one object and Shift-clicking 
to add to the selection, and then press Ctrl+G (Windows) or Ô+G (Mac).
 
2. Select the Free Transform tool.
 
 A bounding box appears around the selected object(s).
 
3. Click any corner point and drag to resize the object.
 
 Hold down the Shift key while dragging to keep the object(s) constrained 
proportionally as you resize.
Changing the stroke of a shape
You can change the stroke of shapes you’ve created. The stroke is the out-
line that appears around the edge of the shape. The stroke can range from 
no stroke to a very thick stroke, and it’s measured in point sizes. Even if a 
shape has a stroke set to 0 points, it still has a stroke! You just can’t see the 
stroke.
Follow these steps to edit the stroke of your shapes:
 
1. Select a shape on the page.
 
 A bounding box appears around the selected shape.
 
2. Select a new width for the Stroke using the Stroke Weight drop-down 
list on the Control panel.
 
 As soon as a value is selected, the stroke automatically changes on the 
page. This number is measured in points. You use some of the other 
options in the following step list.
You can click in the Stroke text field and manually enter a numerical value 
for the stroke width. The higher the number you enter, the thicker the 
stroke. You can also change the style of the stroke with the Stroke panel by 
following these steps:

Editing Basic Shapes
116
 
1. With a basic shape selected, select the stroke type from the drop-down 
list on the Control panel and select a new line.
 
 As soon as a value is selected, the stroke automatically changes.
 
2. Choose a new line weight from the Stroke Weight drop-down list.
 
 For example, we chose 10 points. The shape updates automatically on 
the page.
 
Want to create custom dashes? See more options by choosing Window➪
Stroke Panel. Select a dashed stroke and notice at the bottom of the Stroke 
panel that you can define the dash and gap size. Enter one value for an even 
dash, or several numbers for custom dashes for maps, diagrams, fold marks, 
and more!
Add special ends to the lines with the Start and End drop-down lists. For 
example, you can add an arrowhead or a large circle to the beginning or end 
of the stroke. The Cap and Join buttons allow you to choose the shape of 
the line ends, and how they join with other paths when you’re working with 
complex paths or shapes. For more information on creating and editing lines 
and strokes, see Book I, Chapter 6.
Changing the shear value
You can change the shear of a shape by using the Transform panel. Skew 
and shear are the same thing — they mean that the shape is slanted, so 
you create the appearance of some form of perspective for the skewed 
or sheared element. This transformation is useful if you want to create the 
illusion of depth on the page.
Follow these simple steps to skew a shape:
 
1. With a basic shape selected, choose Window➪Object and Layout➪
Transform.
 
2. Select a value from the Shear drop-down list in the lower-right corner 
of the Transform panel.
 
 After selecting a new value, the shape skews (or shears), depending on 
what value you select. Manually entering a numerical value into this field 
also skews the shape.
Rotating a shape
You can change the rotation of a shape by using the Transform panel. The 
process of rotating a shape is very similar to how you skew a shape (see the 
preceding section):

Book II
Chapter 3
Drawing in InDesign
Drawing Freeform Paths
117
 
1. With a basic shape selected, choose Window➪Object and 
Layout➪Transform.
 
 The Transform panel opens.
 
2. Select a value from the Rotation drop-down list.
 
 After selecting a new value, the shape rotates automatically, based on 
the rotation angle you specified. You can also manually enter a value 
into the text field.
Drawing Freeform Paths
You can use different tools to draw paths. For example, you can use the 
Pencil tool to draw freeform paths. These kinds of paths typically look like 
lines, and you can use the Pencil and Pen tools to create simple or complex 
paths.
Using the Pencil tool
The Pencil tool is perhaps the easiest tool to use when drawing freeform 
paths (see Figure 3-6). Follow these steps to get started:
 
1. Choose File➪New and then click OK in the New Document dialog box 
that appears to create a new document.
 
2. Select the Pencil tool in the toolbox.
 
3. Drag the cursor around the page.
 
 You’ve created a new path by using the Pencil tool.
Using the Pen tool
Using the Pen tool is different from using the Pencil tool. When you start out, 
the Pen tool may seem a bit complicated — but after you get the hang of it, 
using the Pen tool isn’t too hard after all. The Pen tool uses points to create 
a particular path. You can edit these points in order to change the segments 
between them. Getting control of these points can take a bit of practice.
To create points and segments on a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Close any existing documents and create a new document by choosing 
File➪New Document.
 
2. Click OK in the New Document dialog box that appears.
 
 A new document opens with the default settings.
 
3. Select the Pen tool in the toolbox.

Drawing Freeform Paths

4. Click anywhere on the page and then click a second location.
 
 You’ve created a new path with two points and one segment joining 
them.
 
5. Ctrl-click (Windows) or Ô-click (Mac) on an empty part of the page to 
deselect the current path.
 
 After you deselect the path, you can create a new path or add new 
points to the path you just created.
 
6. Add a new point to a selected segment by hovering over the line and 
clicking.
 
 A small + icon appears next to the Pen tool cursor. You can also do the 
same thing by selecting the Add Anchor Point tool (located in the menu 
that flies out when you click and hold the Pen icon in the toolbox).
 
7. Repeat Step 6, but this time click a new location on a line segment and 
drag away from the line.
 
 This creates a curved path. The segments change and curve depending 
on where the points are located along the path. The point you created is 
a curve point.

Editing Freeform Paths

Editing Freeform Paths
Even the best artists sometimes need to make changes or delete parts of 
their work. If you’ve made mistakes or change your mind about a drawing, 
follow the steps in this section to make your changes.
In order to change a path segment, select a point with the Direct Selection tool. 
When a point is selected, it appears solid; unselected points appear hollow.
 
Select the Direct Selection tool by pressing the A key.
All you need to do to select a point is use your cursor to click the point 
itself. Then you can use the handles that appear when the point is selected 
to modify the segments as follows:
 
1. Select the Direct Selection tool from the toolbox and then click a point.
 
 The selected point appears solid. If you select a curve point, handles 
extend from it.
 
 A curved point and a corner point edit differently when you select and 
drag them. Curve points have handles that extend from the point, but 
corner points don’t.
 
2. Drag the point where you want it; to edit a curve point, click a handle 
end and drag the handle left or right.
 
 The path changes, depending on how you drag the handles.
Suppose you have a corner point that you want to make a curve point. You 
can do just that with the Convert Direction Point tool. To understand how 
the Convert Direction Point tool works the best, you should have a path that 
contains both straight and curved segments. Follow these steps to change a 
corner point into a curved point and vice versa:
 
1. Select the Convert Direction Point tool.
 
 This tool resides in a menu under the Pen tool in the toolbox. Hold the 
mouse button down over the Pen tool icon until a menu appears; select 
the Convert Direction Point tool from the menu.
 
2. Click a curved point with the Convert Direction Point tool.
 
 The point you click changes into a corner point, which changes the 
path’s appearance.
 
3. Click and drag a corner point with the Convert Direction Point tool.
 
 The point is modified as a curved point. This changes the appearance of 
the path again.

Making Corner Effects
120
This tool is handy when you need to alter the way your path changes direc-
tion. If you need to manipulate a point in a different way, you may need to 
change its type by using the Convert Direction Point tool.
Making Corner Effects
You can use corner effects on basic shapes to customize the shape’s look. 
Corner effects are great for adding an interesting look to borders. You can 
be very creative with some of the shapes you apply effects to or by applying 
more than one effect to a single shape. Here’s how to create a corner effect 
on a rectangle:
 
1. Select the Rectangle tool and create a new rectangle anywhere on the 
page.
 
 Hold the Shift key when using the Rectangle tool if you want to create a 
square.
 
2. With the Selection tool, select the shape and then choose 
Object➪Corner Options.
 
 The Corner Options dialog box opens.
 
3. Choose an effect from the Effects drop-down list and enter a value into 
the Size text field.
 
 For example, choose the Drop Shadow option to create a soft shadow 
behind an object, or choose Bevel and Emboss to give a 3D effect to an 
object.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The corner effect is applied to the shape.
Using Fills
A fill is located inside a path. You can fill your paths and shapes with several 
different kinds of colors, transparent colors, or even gradients. Fills can help 
you achieve artistic effects and illusions of depth or add interest to a page 
design.
You may have already created a fill. The toolbox contains two swatches: one 
for the stroke (a hollow square) and one for the fill (a solid box). (Refer to 
Figure 2-4 in Chapter 2 of this minibook to locate the Fill and Stroke boxes.) 
If the Fill box contains a color, your shape will have a fill when it’s created. If 
the Fill box has a red line through it, the shape is created without a fill.

Book II
Chapter 3
Drawing in InDesign
Using Fills
121
Creating basic fills
You can create a basic fill in several different ways. One of the most common 
ways is to specify a color in the Fill swatch before you create a new shape. 
To create a shape with a fill, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure the Fill box is selected so that you aren’t adding color to 
the stroke instead.
 
2. Open the Color panel by choosing Window➪Color.
 
3. Select a color in the Color panel.
 
 You can enter values into the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) 
fields manually or by using the sliders. Alternatively, you can use the 
Eyedropper tool to select a color from the color ramp at the bottom of 
the Color panel. For more information on color modes (such as CMYK 
and RGB [Red, Green, Blue] color modes), see Book I, Chapter 7.
 
 Use the Color panel menu to select different color modes if CMYK isn’t 
already selected. Click and hold the arrow button and select CMYK from 
the Color panel menu.
 
 The Fill box in the toolbox is updated with the new color you’ve selected 
in the Color panel.
 
4. Create a new shape on the page.
 
 Select a shape tool and drag on the page to create a shape. The shape is 
filled with the fill color you chose.
 
As in the other Creative Suite 4 applications, you can create tints of a color 
built with CMYK by holding down the Shift key while dragging any color’s 
slider. All color sliders then move proportionally.
You can also choose to use color swatches to select a fill color by using the 
Swatches panel (choose Window➪Swatches to open the Swatches panel). 
Create a new color swatch (of your present color) by clicking the New 
Swatch button at the bottom of the panel. Double-click the new swatch to 
add new color properties by using sliders to set CMYK color values or by 
entering numbers into each text field.
Perhaps you already have a shape without a fill, and you want to add a fill 
to it. Select the shape, and with the Fill box in the toolbox selected, select 
a color from the Color or Swatches panel. A new fill color is applied to the 
shape.

Using Fills
122
 
You can drag and drop a swatch color to fill a shape on a page, even if that 
shape isn’t selected. Open the Swatches panel by choosing Window➪
Swatches and then drag the color swatch over to the shape. Release the 
mouse button, and the fill color is applied automatically to the shape.
Making transparent fills
Fills that are partially transparent can create some very interesting effects 
for the layout of your document. You can set transparency to more than one 
element on the page and layer those elements to create the illusion of depth 
and stacking.
Follow these steps to apply transparency to an element on the page:
 
1. With the Selection tool, select a shape on the page.
 
 A bounding box appears around the selected shape.
 
2. Open the Effects panel by choosing Window➪Effects.
 
3. Use the Opacity slider to change how transparent the shape appears.
 
 Click the arrow to open the slider or click in the text field to manually 
enter a value using the keyboard. The effect is immediately applied to 
the selected shape.
 
4. Select Stroke or Fill in the Effects panel to apply a separate opacity 
to each.
Looking at gradients
A gradient is the color transition from one color (or no color) to a different 
color. Gradients can have two or more colors in the transition.
Gradients can add interesting effects to shapes, including 3D effects. 
Sometimes you can use a gradient to achieve glowing effects or the effect of 
light hitting a surface. The two kinds of gradients available in InDesign are 
radial and linear, as shown in Figure 3-7:
 
✦ Radial: A transition of colors in a circular fashion from a center point 
radiating outwards.
 
✦ Linear: A transition of colors along a straight path.
You can apply a gradient to a stroke, a fill, or even text. To apply a gradient 
to a stroke, simply select the stroke instead the fill.
 
Even though you can apply a gradient to the stroke of live text, you’ll create 
a printing nightmare . . . use these features sparingly!

Here’s how to add a gradient fill to a shape:
 
1. With the Selection tool, select the object that you want to apply a 
gradient to and then choose Window➪Swatches.
 
 The Swatches panel opens.
 
2. Choose New Gradient Swatch from the Swatches panel menu.
 
 The New Gradient Swatch dialog box opens (see Figure 3-8).

3. Type a new name for the swatch in the Swatch Name field.
 
 Sometimes giving the swatch a descriptive name, such as what the 
swatch is being used for, is helpful.
 
4. Choose Linear or Radial from the Type drop-down list.
 
 This option determines the type of gradient the swatch will create each 
time you use it. We chose Radial from the drop-down list in Figure 3-8.
 
5. Manipulate the gradient stops below the Gradient Ramp to position 
each color in the gradient.
 
 Gradient stops are the color chips located below the Gradient Ramp. You 
can move the diamond shape above the Gradient Ramp to determine the 
center point of the gradient. You can select each gradient stop to change 
the color and move them around to edit the gradient. When the gradient 
stops are selected, you can change the color values in the Stop Color 
area by using sliders or by entering values in each CMYK text field.
 
 You can add a new color to the gradient by clicking the area between the 
gradient stops. Then you can edit the new stop just like the others. To 
remove the gradient stop, drag the stop away from the Gradient Ramp.
 
6. Click OK when you’re finished.
 
 The gradient swatch is created and applied to the selected object.
 
To edit a gradient, double-click the gradient’s swatch. This step opens the 
Gradient Options dialog box, which allows you to modify the settings made 
in the New Gradient Swatch dialog box.
Removing fills
Removing fills is even easier than creating them:
 
1. Select the shape with the Selection tool.
 
 A bounding box appears around the shape.
 
2. Click the Fill box in the toolbox.
 
3. Click the Apply None button located below the Fill box.
 
 This button is white with a red line through it. The fill is removed from 
the selected shape, and the Fill box is changed to no fill. You’ll also see 
the None fill on the Swatches and Color panels.
 
 If you’re using a single row toolbox, you don’t see the Apply None 
button unless you click and hold down on the Apply Gradient (or Color) 
button because the button is hidden beneath it.

Adding Layers
125
Adding Layers
Layers are like transparent sheets stacked on top of one another. If you add 
layers to your drawings, you can create the appearance that graphics are 
stacked on top of one another. The Layers panel allows you to create new 
layers, delete layers you don’t need, or even rearrange them to change the 
stacking order. Use layers to create alternate versions of InDesign files, or 
just to replace logos. Here’s how you work with layers in InDesign:
 
1. Open the Layers panel by choosing Window➪Layers.
 
 This panel allows you to create, delete, and arrange layers.
 
2. Draw a shape on the page using a shape tool.
 
 Create the shape anywhere on the page. Create it large enough so that 
you can easily stack another shape on top of part of it.
 
3. Click the Create New Layer button in the Layers panel to create a new 
layer.
 
 A new layer is stacked on top of the currently selected layer and 
becomes the active layer.
 
 Double-click a layer to give it an appropriate name, or even better yet, 
hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key and click the New Layer 
button to bring up the Layer Options dialog box before the layer is created.
 
 Make sure that the layer you want to create content on is selected 
before you start modifying the layer. You can tell what layer is selected 
because the selected layer is always highlighted in the Layers panel. You 
can easily accidentally add content to the incorrect layer if you don’t 
check this panel frequently. (If you add an item to the wrong layer, you 
can always cut and paste items to the correct layer.)
 
4. Make sure a shape tool is still selected and then create a shape on the 
new layer by dragging the cursor so that part of the new shape covers 
the shape you created in Step 2.
 
 The new shape is stacked on top of the shape you created in Step 2.

Chapter 4: Working with Text 
and Text Frames
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding text and frames in a publication
✓ Adding and importing text
✓ Exploring text frame options
✓ Changing paragraph settings
✓ Editing with text editors and spell checking
✓ Working with tables
✓ Creating and editing text on a path
M
ost of your publications contain text, so knowing how to use and 
modify text are very important in InDesign. Text is made up of char-
acters, and the characters are styled in a particular font. (If you’re wonder-
ing about fonts, check out Book I, Chapter 6, where we explain more about 
fonts and font faces.)
This chapter explains how InDesign uses text in publications and gets you 
started editing and manipulating text in text frames — containers on the 
page that hold text content. The most important things you can take away 
from this chapter are how to add text to your publication and then change 
the text so that it looks how you want it to look when laid out on the page. 
In Chapter 5 of this minibook, find out how to create effective layouts that 
contain both text and graphics so that your audience will be encouraged to 
read everything!
Understanding Text, Font, and Frames
Text is usually integral to a publication because it contains specific informa-
tion you want or need to convey to an audience. Understanding some of the 
terminology that appears in the following pages is important: Text and font 
refer to similar things, although they’re quite different from each other in 
the specifics:

Creating and Using Text Frames
128
 
✦ Text: The letters, words, sentences, and/or paragraphs making up con-
tent in the text frames in your publication.
 
✦ Font: The particular design forming a set of characters used for text. 
You can find thousands of styles of fonts to choose from and install on 
your computer for your use.
Frames are like containers that are used to hold content. You can use the fol-
lowing two kinds of frames in a publication:
 
✦ Text frame: Contains text in a publication. You can link text frames so 
that text flows from one text frame to another, and you can have text 
wrap around graphic frames.
 
✦ Graphic frame: A graphic frame holds an image that you place into your 
publication.
The nice thing about shapes and frames is that they automatically change 
to adapt to the content in them! You can use both the frame and Shape tools 
for text and graphics.
Creating and Using Text Frames
Text frames contain any text that you add to a publication. You can create a 
new text frame in many different ways. InDesign also allows you to add text 
to creative shapes that you draw, thereby changing them into text frames. 
Creating and using text frames in your publication is important because 
you’ll typically use a lot of text. Throughout the following subsections, we 
show you how to create text frames in different but important ways using 
three different tools. (If you need a refresher on the tools, check out Chapter 
2 of this minibook.)
 
Text frames are sometimes automatically created when you import text into 
a publication. You find out how to do this in the “Importing text” section, 
later in this chapter.
Creating text frames with the Type tool
You can use the Type tool to create a text frame. If you take the Type tool 
and click the page, nothing happens unless you’ve first created a frame to 
put text in. Here’s how to create a text frame with the Type tool:
 
1. Select the Type tool in the toolbox and place it over the page.
 
 The Type tool cursor is an I-bar. Move the cursor to where you want the 
upper-left corner of your text frame to be.

and Text Frames

2. Drag diagonally to create a text frame.
 
 When you click, the mouse has a cross-like appearance. When you drag, 
an outline of the text frame appears, giving you a reference to its dimen-
sions, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
Figure 4-1: 
With the 
Type tool, 
drag to 
create a text 
frame.
 
 
3. Release the mouse button when the frame is the correct size.
 
 The text frame is created, and an insertion point is placed in the 
upper-left corner of the frame. You can start typing on the keyboard 
to enter text or import text from another source (see the later section, 
“Importing text”).
Creating text frames with the Frame tool
You can use the Frame tool to create frames that are rectangular, oval, or 
polygonal. Then, after you’ve placed the frame on the page, you can turn it 
into a text frame or back into a graphic frame. To create a new text frame 
with the Frame tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the Frame tool from the toolbox and drag diagonally to create 
a new frame.
 
 A new frame is created on the page.
 
2. Select the Type tool and click inside the frame.
 
 The X across the frame disappears, and the frame is now a text frame 
instead of a graphic frame.
 
3. Choose the Selection tool and use it to move the text frame.
 
 You can move the text frame if you click within the frame using the 
Selection tool and drag it to a new location. An outline of the frame 
moves with the cursor, as shown in Figure 4-2, so that you can see where 
the text frame is placed when you release the mouse button.

Adding Text to Your Publication

Creating text frames from a shape
If you have an interesting shape that you’ve created with the drawing tools 
that we discuss in Chapter 3 of this minibook, you can easily change that 
shape into a text frame. You can then add text within the shape. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. With the Pen, Pencil, or a Shape tool, create a shape with a stroke 
color and no fill.
 
 A shape is created on the page that doesn’t have a solid color for the fill. 
We used the Pencil tool to create a freeform shape for this example.
 
2. Select the Type tool from the toolbox.
 
 The Type tool becomes active.
 
3. Click within the shape you created in Step 1 and enter some text.
 
 This changes the shape into a text frame. Notice how the text is confined 
within the shape as you type.
Adding Text to Your Publication
In the previous section’s step lists, you found out how to add text simply by 
clicking in the text frame and typing new content, but you can also add text 
to your publications in other ways. This is particularly useful when you use 
other applications to create and edit documents containing text.
Importing text
You can import text that you’ve created and/or edited with other software, 
such as Word, Excel, or Adobe InCopy (used for word processing). Importing 
edited text is a typical workflow when creating a publication, because dedi-
cated text-editing software is often used to edit manuscripts before layout.

Book II
Chapter 4
Working with Text 
and Text Frames
Adding Text to Your Publication
131
To import text into InDesign, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Place.
 
 The Place dialog box opens. Choose an importable file (such as a Word 
document, an InCopy story, or a plain text file) by browsing through 
your hard drive.
 
2. Select a document to import and click the Open button.
 
 The Place Text icon, the cursor arrow, and a thumbnail of your text 
appear. Move the cursor around the page to where you want the 
upper-left corner of the text frame to be created when the document is 
imported.
 
3. Click to place the imported text.
 
 This step creates a text frame and imports the text.
 
If you select a text frame before importing text, the text is automatically 
placed inside the text frame — so, in this case, you wouldn’t have to use the 
cursor to place the text. You can move the text frame anywhere on the page 
after the text is added, or you can resize the frame if necessary.
Controlling text flow
Control the flow of the text by using these simple modifier keys while placing 
text:
 
✦ Choose File➪Place, select the file you want to import, and click Open. 
Hold down the Shift key, and when the loaded cursor turns into a curvy 
arrow, click the document. The text is imported and automatically flows 
from one column to another, or page to page until it runs out. InDesign 
even creates the pages if needed.
 
✦ Choose File➪Place, select the file you want to import, and click Open. 
Hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key. Then click and drag 
a text area. (Don’t release the Alt or Option key!) You can continue click-
ing and dragging additional text frames, and your text will flow from one 
text frame to another until you run out of copy!
 
If you check the Show Import Options check box in the Place window, a 
second window appears in which you can choose to remove styles and for-
matting from text and tables. This will then bring in clean, unformatted text 
for you to edit.

Adding Text to Your Publication
132
Adding placeholder text
Suppose that you’re creating a publication, but the text you need to import 
into the publication isn’t ready to import into InDesign. (Perhaps the text 
is still being created or edited.) Instead of waiting for the final text, you 
can use placeholder text and continue to create your publication’s layout. 
Placeholder text is commonly used to temporarily fill a document with text. 
The text looks a lot like normal blocks of text, which is more natural than 
trying to paste the same few words over and over to fill up a text frame. 
However, placeholder text is actually not in any particular language at all 
because it’s just being used as filler.
InDesign has the ability to add placeholder text into a text frame automatically. 
Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Create a frame on the page by selecting the Type tool and dragging 
diagonally to create a text frame.
 
2. Choose Type➪Fill with Placeholder Text.
 
 The text frame is automatically filled with characters and words, similar 
to Figure 4-3.
 
Figure 4-3: 
The text 
frame

placeholder 
text.

Chapter 4
Working with Text 
and Text Frames
Looking at Text Frame Options
133
Copying and pasting text
Another way to move text from one application into your publication is by 
copying and pasting the text directly into InDesign. If you select and copy 
text in another program, you can paste it directly into InDesign from your 
computer’s Clipboard. Here’s how:
 
1. Highlight the text that you want to use in your publication and press 
Ctrl+C (Windows) or Ô+C (Mac) to copy the text.
 
 When you copy the text, it sits on the Clipboard until it’s replaced with 
something new. This means that you can transfer this information into 
InDesign.
 
2. Open InDesign and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Ô+V (Mac) to create a 
new text frame and paste the text into it.
 
 A new text frame appears centered on the page with your selected text 
inside it.
 
You can also click in a text frame and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Ô+V (Mac) 
to paste text from the Clipboard directly into an existing frame. You can do 
the same thing with an image, as well.
All you need to do is double-click a text frame if you want to access, edit, 
type, or paste some text into it.
Looking at Text Frame Options
In the previous sections of this chapter, we show you how to create text 
frames and enter text into them. In this section, we show you how to organize 
text frames in your publication and achieve the results you need. Controlling 
text frames so that they do what you need them to do is a matter of knowing 
how they work after you have text in them.
InDesign gives you a lot of control over the text in your publication. 
Changing text frame options allows you to change the way text is placed 
inside a frame. Changing these kinds of settings is sometimes important 
when you’re working with particular kinds of fonts. (To read more about 
fonts, check out Book I, Chapter 6.)
The text frame contextual menu contains many options for the text frame. 
This menu allows you to perform basic commands, such as copy and paste, 
fill the text frame with placeholder text, make transformations, add or modify 
strokes, and change the kind of frame it is. Access the text frame contextual 
menu by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac) a text frame. You 
can also find most of these options in the Type and Object menus.

Looking at Text Frame Options
134
Changing text frame options
To change text frame options that control the look of the text within the 
frame, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a rectangular text frame on the page, select the frame and 
choose Object➪Text Frame Options.
 
 You can also press Ctrl+B (Windows) or Ô+B (Mac) or use the text 
frame’s contextual menu to open the Text Frame Options dialog box.
 
 You can tell that a text frame is selected when it has handles around its 
bounding box.
 
 The Text Frame Options dialog box appears, showing you the current 
settings for the selected text frame.
 
2. Select the Preview check box to automatically view updates.
 
 Now any changes you make in the dialog box are instantly updated on 
the page. This means you can make your changes and see how they’ll 
look before you apply them.
 
3. In the Inset Spacing area of the dialog box, change the Top, Bottom, 
Left, and Right values.
 
 These values are used to inset text from the edges of the text frame. The 
text is pushed inside the frame edge by the value you set.
 
 You can also indent your text, which we discuss in the section, 
“Indenting your text,” later in this chapter. You can choose how to align 
the text vertically (Top, Center, Bottom, or Justify) with this dialog box. 
You can align the text to the top or bottom of the text frame, center it 
vertically in the frame, or evenly space the lines in the frame from top to 
bottom (Justify).
 
4. When you’re finished making changes in this dialog box, click OK.
 
 The changes you made are applied to the text frame.
Using and modifying columns
You can specify that the document contain a certain number of columns on 
the page when you create a new publication. Using columns allows you to 
snap new text frames to the columns so that they’re properly spaced on the 
page. You can even modify the amount of the gutter, which is the spacing 
between the columns.

Book II
Chapter 4
Working with Text 
and Text Frames
Looking at Text Frame Options
135
You can also create columns within a single text frame by using the Text 
Frame Options dialog box. You can add up to 40 columns in a single text 
frame. If you already have text in a frame, it’s automatically divided amongst 
the columns you add. The following steps show you how to add columns to 
a text frame on a page:
 
1. Create a rectangular text frame on the page.
 
 Use the Text or Frame tool to create the text frame. You can create col-
umns in text frames that are rectangular, oval, or even freehand shapes 
drawn on the page.
 
2. Select the text frame and enter some text.
 
 You can type some text, paste text copied from another document, or 
add placeholder text by choosing Type➪Fill with Placeholder Text.
 
3. With the text frame still selected, choose Object➪Text Frame Options.
 
 The Text Frame Options dialog box opens. Be sure to select the Preview 
check box in the dialog box, which enables you to immediately view the 
changes your settings make to the frame on the page.
 
4. In the Columns section, change the value in the Number text field.
 
 In this example, we entered 2 in the Number text field. The selected text 
frame divides the text in the frame into two columns.
 
5. Change the width of the columns by entering a new value in the 
Width text field.
 
 The width of the columns is automatically set, depending on the width 
of the text frame you created. We entered 10 (picas) in the Width text 
field for this example. The text frame changes size depending on the 
width you set in this column. When you click in a different text field in 
the dialog box, the text frame updates on the page to reflect the new 
value setting.
 
6. Change the value in the Gutter text field.
 
 The gutter value controls how large the space is in between columns. If 
the gutter is too wide, change the value in the Gutter text field to a lower 
number. We entered 0p5 in the Gutter text field for this example to 
change the gutter to half a point in width.
 
7. When you’re finished, click OK to apply the changes.
 
 The changes are applied to the text frame you modified.

Modifying and Connecting Text Frames on a Page

After you create the columns in the text frame, you can resize the frame by 
using the handles on its bounding box, which is detailed in the upcoming 
section, “Resizing and moving the text frame.” The columns resize as neces-
sary to divide the text frame into the number of columns you specified in the 
Text Frame Options dialog box. If you select the Fixed Column Width check 
box in the Text Frame Options dialog box, your text frames will always be 
the width you specify, no matter how you resize the text frame. When resiz-
ing the text frame, the frame snaps to the designated fixed width.
Modifying and Connecting Text Frames on a Page
Making modifications to text frames and then connecting them to other text 
frames in a publication so that the story can continue on a separate page is 
vital in most publications. You’ll typically work with stories of many para-
graphs that need to continue on different pages in the document.
When you have a text frame on the page, you need to be able to change the 
size, position, and linking of the frame. You need to link the frame to other 
frames on the page so that the text can flow between them. This is important 
if you’re creating a layout that contains a lot of text.
If you paste more text content than is visible in the text frame, the text 
still exists beyond the boundaries of the text frame — so if you have a text 
frame that’s 20 lines tall, but you paste 50 lines of text in, the last 30 lines 
are cropped off. You need to resize the text frame or have the text flow to 
another frame in order to see the rest of the text you pasted. You can tell 
that the frame has more content when you see a small plus sign (+) in a 
special handle on the text frame’s bounding box.
Resizing and moving the text frame
When creating most layouts, you regularly resize text frames and move them 
around the document while you figure out how you want the page layout to 
look. You can resize and move a text frame by following these steps:
 
1. Use the Selection tool to select a text frame on the page.
 
 A bounding box with handles appears on the page. If the text frame has 
more text than it can show at the current size, a small handle with a red 
box appears on the bounding box. Therefore, you can’t use this handle 
to resize the text frame.
 
2. Drag one of the handles to resize the text frame.
 
 The frame updates automatically on the page while you drag the han-
dles, as shown in Figure 4-4. Change the width or height by dragging the 
handles at the center of each side of the frame, or change the height and 
the width at the same time by dragging a corner handle.
 
 Shift+drag a corner handle to scale the text frame proportionally.

and Text Frames

3. When you’re finished resizing the text frame, click the middle of a 
selected frame and move it around the page.
 
 If you click within the frame once and drag it, you move the frame 
around the page. An outline of the frame follows your cursor and repre-
sents where the frame is placed if you release the mouse button. Simply 
release the frame when you’re finished moving it.
 
If you’re using guides or grids on the page, the text frame snaps to them. 
Also, if you opened a document with columns, the text frame snaps to the 
columns when you drag the frame close to the column guidelines. You can 
find out about guides, grids, and snapping in Chapter 5 of this minibook.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Resize a text 
frame by 
dragging the 
handles.
 
You can also use the Transform panel in order to change the location and 
dimensions of a text frame. If the Transform panel isn’t already open, choose 
Window➪Object and Layout➪Transform to open the panel. Then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Change the values in the X and Y text fields.
 
 Enter 1 in both the X and Y text fields to move the text frame to the 
upper-left corner of the page.
 
 The X and Y coordinates (location) of the text frame update to 1,1. A 
small square can be seen in the middle of the text frame. This square is 
the reference point of the text frame, meaning that the X and Y coordi-
nates you set match the position of this point of the text frame.
 
 
 Change the reference point by clicking any point in the reference point 
indicator in the upper left of the control panel.
 
2. Change the values in the W and H text fields.
 
 For this example, we entered 35 (picas) in the W and H text fields. The 
text frame’s width and height changes to the dimensions you specify. 
Using the Transform panel to change the width and height is ideal if you 
need to set an exact measurement for the frame.

Modifying and Connecting Text Frames on a Page

Not only can you resize and move text frames; you can also change their 
shape. Select a text frame and choose the Direct Selection tool from the tool-
box. You can then select the corners on the text frame and move them to 
reshape the text frame.
Threading text frames
Understanding how to thread text frames together is very important if you 
plan to build page layouts with a lot of text. Threading is when text frames 
are arranged so that the text in one frame continues on in a second text 
frame. Threading is useful for most layouts because you can’t always include 
all your text in a single frame.
First, take a look at some of the terminology because Adobe has some spe-
cial names for text frames that are linked together. Figure 4-5 shows some of 
the icons that we refer to in the following list:
 
Figure 4-5: 
The in port 
and out 
port depict 
threaded 
text frames.

✦ Flowing: When text starts in one frame and continues in a second frame.
 
✦ Threading: When two text frames have text flowing from the first to the 
second frame, the text frames are considered to be threaded.
 
✦ Story: The group of sentences and paragraphs you have in threaded text 
frames.

Book II
Chapter 4
Working with Text 
and Text Frames
Modifying and Connecting Text Frames on a Page
139
 
✦ In port: An icon on the upper-left side of a text frame’s bounding box 
that allows you to tell whether a frame is the first frame in a story or has 
text flowing in from another frame. An in port icon has a story flowing 
into it if it contains a small arrow; otherwise, the in port icon is empty.
 
✦ Out port: An icon on the lower-right side of the text frame’s bounding 
box that allows you to tell whether a frame has text flowing out of it. The 
out port icon contains a small arrow if the frame is threaded to another 
frame; an empty out port icon signifies the frame isn’t connected to 
another text frame.
 
 If a text frame isn’t connected to another frame and has overset text 
(more text than can be displayed in a text frame), the out port shows a 
small red + icon.
Find a block of text that you want to thread (for best results, try to use a 
block of text that has formed sentences, as opposed to placeholder text), 
and then follow these steps:
 
1. Copy some text onto the Clipboard, such as text from the InDesign 
help files, a page loaded in a Web browser window, or a document 
you have in Word, Notepad, or SimpleText.
 
 What kind of content you’re pasting in doesn’t matter. You only need 
to make sure the text is at least a few paragraphs long so that you have 
enough text to flow between frames.
 
 In Figure 4-5, you can see the text thread represented with a line con-
necting one text frame to another. InDesign shows you text threads if 
you choose View➪Show Text Threads.
 
2. Use the Type tool to create two text frames on a page.
 
 The text frames can be above or beside one another, similar to the 
layout in Figure 4-6.
 
3. With the Text tool, click in the first text frame, which is above or to 
the left of the second text frame.
 
 A blinking insertion point appears in the first text frame, allowing you to 
enter or paste text into the frame.
 
4. Press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Ô+V (Mac) to paste the text into the text 
frame.
 
 The text you’ve copied on the Clipboard enters into the frame. If you’ve 
pasted enough text, you see the overset text icon (a red +) on the lower-
right side of the text frame, as shown in Figure 4-6. If you don’t see the 
overset text icon, use the Paste command a second time so that more 
text is entered into the frame.

5. Click the overset text icon with the Selection tool.
 
 The cursor changes into the loaded text icon. This icon means you can 
select or create another text frame to thread the story.
 
6. Move the cursor over the second text frame and click.
 
 The cursor changes into the thread text icon when it’s poised over the 
second text frame. When you click the second text frame, the two frames 
are threaded because the text continues in the second frame.
You can continue creating more frames and threading them. You can thread 
them on the same page or on subsequent pages.
You can unthread text as well, which means you’re breaking the link between 
two text frames. You can rearrange which frames are used to thread text, 
such as changing what page the story continues on when it’s threaded to a 
second text frame. Break the connection by double-clicking the in port or 
the out port icon of the text frame that you want to unthread. The frame is 
then unthreaded (but no text is deleted).
 
If you don’t have multiple pages in your document, choose File➪Document 
Setup. Change the value in the Number of Pages text field to 2 or greater and 
click OK when you’re finished. Now you can click through the pages using 
the Page Field control at the bottom of the workspace.

Adding a page jump number
If you have multiple pages, you can add a page jump number (text that noti-
fies a reader where the story continues if it jumps to a text frame on another 
page) to an existing file. Before you start, make sure that a story threads 
between text frames on two different pages and then follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new text frame on the first page and type continued on page.
 
2. Use the Selection tool to select the text frame you just created.
 
3. Move the text frame so that it slightly overlaps the text frame contain-
ing the story.
 
 Let InDesign know what text frame it’s tracking the story from or to. 
Overlap the two text frames (and keep them overlapped), as shown in 
Figure 4-7, so that InDesign knows to associate these text frames (the 
continued notice text frame and the story text frame) with each other.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Slightly 
overlap the 
two text 
frames so 
that the 
story can be 
tracked.
 
 
 You can then group these two text frames, which means that they’ll 
move together. Choose Object➪Group with both text frames selected. 
(Shift-click with the Selection tool to select both text frames.)
 
4. Double-click the new text frame (which contains the text contin-
ued on page) to place the insertion point where you want the page 
number to be inserted.
 
 The page number is inserted where you have the insertion point, so 
make sure that a space appears after the preceding character.
 
5. Choose Type➪Insert Special Character➪Markers➪Next Page Number.
 
 A number is added into the text frame. This number is sensitive to 
where the next threaded text frame is, so if you move the second text 
frame, the page number updates automatically.

Understanding Paragraph Settings
142
 
You can do the same thing for adding where a story is continued from. 
Repeat these steps, except when you get to Step 4, choose Type➪Insert 
Special Character➪Markers➪Previous Page Number.
Understanding Paragraph Settings
You can change the settings for an entire text frame or a single paragraph
 in a text frame in several ways. You can use the Paragraph panel to 
make adjustments to a single paragraph or an entire text frame’s indenta-
tion, justification, and alignment. Open the Paragraph panel by choosing 
Window➪Type & Tables➪Paragraph.
 
If you want the changes in the Paragraph panel to span across all the text 
frames you create, don’t select any paragraph or text frame before making the 
changes; instead, select the entire text frame or frames on the page first. Then 
the selections you make in the Paragraph panel affect all the paragraphs in the 
selected text frame(s) instead of just one paragraph. If you want the selections 
you make in the Paragraph panel to affect just one paragraph within a text 
frame, select that paragraph first and then make your changes.
Indenting your text
You can indent a paragraph in a story with the Paragraph panel. Indentation 
moves the paragraph away from the edges of the text frame’s bounding box. 
Here’s how you modify indentation:
 
1. Create a text frame on the page and fill it with text.
 
 You can fill the text frame by typing text, copying and pasting text, or 
inserting placeholder text by choosing Text➪Fill with Placeholder Text.
 
2. Make sure that the insertion point is blinking in the text frame in the 
paragraph you want to change or use the Selection tool to select the 
text frame.
 
3. Choose Window➪Type & Tables➪Paragraph to open the Paragraph 
panel.
 
 The Paragraph panel opens, showing the text frame’s current settings. 
See Figure 4-8 to find out the name of each setting control.
 
4. Change the value in the Left Indent text field and press Enter.
 
5. Change the value in the First Line Left Indent text field and press 
Enter.
 
If you want to change all the paragraphs in a story, click the insertion point 
in a paragraph and choose Edit➪Select All before changing your settings.

Text alignment and justification
You can use the alignment and justification buttons in the Paragraph panel 
to format your text frames. Align helps you left, center, or right align the text 
with the edges of the text frames. Justification allows you to space the text in 
relation to the edges of the text frame. Justification also allows you to justify 
the final line of text in the paragraph. (See Figure 4-8 to see the align and jus-
tify buttons in the Paragraph panel.) To align and/or justify a block of text, 
click one of the align and justify buttons.
Saving a paragraph style
Ever go through all the work of finding just the right indent, font, or spac-
ing that you want in your copy just to find that you have to apply those 
attributes a hundred times to complete your project? How about when you 
decide that the indent is too much? Wouldn’t it be nice to change one indent 
textbox and have it update all other occurrences? You can do this with para-
graph styles in InDesign.
To create a paragraph style, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a text frame, add text, and apply a first-line indent, any size of 
indent that you want to use.
 
 Select some of the text — you don’t have to select it all.
 
2. Choose Window➪Type & Tables➪Paragraph Styles.
 
 The Paragraph Styles panel opens.
 
3. From the Paragraph Styles panel menu, choose New Paragraph Style.
 
 The New Paragraph Style dialog box opens. Note that every attribute, 
font, size, indent, and so on is already recorded in this unnamed style. 
You don’t have to do anything at this point but name the style.

Editing Stories

4. Change the name from Paragraph Style 1 to something more appropri-
ate, such as BodyCopy, and click OK.
 
 Your style’s been created! After you click OK, the dialog box closes, and 
the new style is added to the Paragraph Styles panel list. You can modify 
the settings by double-clicking the style name in the Paragraph Styles 
panel. You can apply the style to other text frames by selecting the 
frame and clicking the style in the Paragraph Styles panel.
 
If you want to change an existing style, the New Paragraph Style dialog box 
has several different areas in a large list on the left side. Select an item in the 
list to view and change the associated paragraph properties on the right side 
of the dialog box to update all usages of that paragraph style.
 
You can import paragraph styles from other documents or from a file on 
your hard drive. This is particularly useful when you need to use a par-
ticular set of styles for a template. To import paragraph styles, choose 
Load Paragraph Styles from the Paragraph Styles panel menu. A dialog box 
prompts you to browse your hard drive for a file. Select the file to load and 
click OK.
Editing Stories
Your publications will likely have a lot of text in them, and some of that text 
may need to be edited. InDesign has a built-in story editor for editing text. 
This feature can be useful when it’s inconvenient or impossible to open 
another text editor to make changes.
 
InDesign solidly integrates with another Adobe product — InCopy — which 
is a text editor that’s similar to Microsoft Word, but has integration capabili-
ties with InDesign for streamlined page layout.
Using the story editor
The InDesign story editor allows you to view the story outside tiny columns 
and format the text as necessary. To open the story editor to edit a piece of 
text, follow these steps:
 
1. Find a piece of text that you want to edit and select the text frame 
with the Selection tool.
 
 A bounding box with handles appears around the text frame.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Edit in Story Editor, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Y 
(Windows) or Ô+Y (Mac).
 
 The story editor opens in a new window right in the InDesign workspace.

Book II
Chapter 4

3. Edit the story in the window as necessary and click the Close button 
when you’re finished.
 
 Your story appears in one block of text. Any paragraph styles that you 
apply to the text in the story editor are noted in an Information pane at 
the left side of the workspace.
 
Notice in Figure 4-9 that you can now see tables in the story editor. Click the 
small table icon to collapse and expand the table in the story editor.
Checking for correct spelling
Typos and spelling errors are very easy to make. Therefore, it’s important 
to check for correct spelling in a document before you print or export it to a 
PDF. Here’s how to check for spelling in InDesign:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Check Spelling.
 
2. In the Check Spelling dialog box that appears, choose a selection to 
search from the Search drop-down list and then click the Start button.
 
 The spell check automatically starts searching through the story or 
document.
 
3. Choose from three options:
 
• Click the Skip button to ignore a misspelled word.
 
• Select a suggested spelling correction from the list in the Suggested 
Corrections pane and click the Change button.
 
• Choose Ignore All to ignore any more instances of that word.
 
 The spelling is corrected right in the text frame and moves on to the 
next spelling error.
 
4. Click the Done button to stop the spell check; otherwise, click OK 
when InDesign gives you an alert that the spell check is done.
Using custom spelling dictionaries
You can easily add words, such as proper nouns, to your dictionary by click-
ing the Add button.
You can create a user dictionary, or you can add user dictionaries from 
previous InDesign versions, from files that others have sent you, or from a 
server. The dictionary you add is used for all your InDesign documents.
Follow these steps to create your own custom dictionary:

Editing Stories
146
 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Dictionary (Windows) or 
InDesign➪Preferences➪Dictionary (Mac).
 
 The Preferences dialog box appears with the Dictionary section visible.
 
2. From the Language drop-down list, choose the language of your 
dictionary.
 
3. Click the New User Dictionary button below the Language drop-down list.
 
4. Specify the name and location of the user dictionary and then click OK.
 
If you want to see when a spelling error occurs without accessing the Check 
Spelling dialog box, choose Edit➪Spelling➪Dynamic Spelling. Unknown 
words are then highlighted. To correct the spelling, right-click (Windows) or 
Ô-click (Mac) and select the correct spelling from the contextual menu or 
add the word to your dictionary.

Using Tables
147
Using Tables
A table is made of columns and rows, which divides a table into cells. You 
see tables every day on television, in books and magazines, and all over the 
Web. In fact, a calendar is a table: All the days in a month are shown down 
a column, every week is a row, and each day is a cell. You can use tables for 
many different things, such as listing products, employees, or events.
The following list describes the components of a table and how you can 
modify them in InDesign:
 
✦ Rows: Rows extend horizontally across the table. You can modify the 
height of a row.
 
✦ Columns: Columns are vertical in a table. You can modify the width of a 
column.
 
✦ Cells: Each cell is a text frame. You can enter information into this frame 
and format it like any other text frame in InDesign.
Creating tables
The easiest way to create a table is to have data ready to go. (Mind you, this 
isn’t the only way.) But flowing in existing data is the most dynamic way of 
seeing what InDesign can do with tables.
Follow these steps to experiment with the table feature:
 
1. Create a text area and insert tabbed copy into it.
 
 The example used is dates for an event:
 
 Summer Events
 
 June July 
August
 
 1 
2 
3
 
 4 
5 
6
 
 Notice that the text was simply keyed in with the Tab key pressed 
between each new entry. The text doesn’t even need to be lined up.
 
2. Select the text and choose Table➪Convert Text to Table.
 
 The Convert Text to Table Options window appears. You can select col-
umns here or let the tabs in your text determine columns. You can find 
out more about table styles in the “Creating table styles” section of this 
chapter.
 
 You can assign a table style at the same time as converting text to a table.

Using Tables
148
 
3. Click OK to accept the default settings.
 
4. Hold down the Shift key and grab the outside right border to stretch 
the table in or out.
 
 The cells proportionally accommodate the new table size.
 
5. Click and drag across the cells and then choose Table➪Merge Cells to 
merge the top three cells.
To create a new table without existing text, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new text frame with the Type tool.
 
 The insertion point should be blinking in the new text frame you create. 
If it isn’t blinking, or if you created a new frame another way, double-
click the text frame so that the insertion point (I-bar) is active. You can’t 
create a table unless the insertion point is active in the text frame.
 
2. Choose Table➪Insert Table.
 
3. In the Insert Table dialog box that opens, enter the number of rows 
and columns you want to add to the table in the Rows and Columns 
text fields and then click OK.
 
 For example, we created a table with six rows and three columns.
Editing table settings
You can control many settings for tables. InDesign allows you to change the 
text, fill, and stroke properties for each cell or the table itself. Because of 
this flexibility, you can create fully customized tables to display your infor-
mation in an intuitive and creative way. In this section, we show you some of 
the basic options you have for editing your tables.
To get started editing the table settings, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the table you want to make changes to by clicking in one of the 
cells.
 
2. Choose Table➪Table Options➪Table Setup.
 
 The Table Options dialog box opens with the Table Setup tab selected. 
The dialog box contains several tabs that contain settings you can 
change for different parts of the table.
 
 The Table Setup tab allows you to edit the columns and rows, border, 
and spacing, as well as how column or row strokes are rendered in rela-
tion to each other. For example, we changed the number of rows and 
columns and changed the table border weight to a 3-pt stroke.

3. Select the Preview check box at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
 The Preview is activated so that you can view the changes you made on 
the page while you’re using the dialog box.
 
4. Click the Row Strokes tab and change the options.
 
 For this example, we selected Every Second Row from the Alternating 
Pattern drop-down list, changed the Table Border Weight to 2, and 
changed the Color property for the first row to C=15, M=100 Y=100, K=0 
(this is the CMYK equivalent of red).
 
 This step causes every second row to have a red, 2-pt stroke. You can 
also click the Column Strokes tab if you want to change the properties 
for column strokes. The two tabs work the same way.
 
5. Click the Fills tab and change the options.
 
 For this example, we chose Every Other Column from the Alternating 
Pattern drop-down list, changed the Color property to the same CMYK 
equivalent of red, and left the Tint at the default of 20%. This step 
changes the first row to a red tint.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The changes you made in the Table Options dialog box are applied to 
the table.
 
7. Click in one of the table cells so that the insertion point is blinking.
 
 The table cell is selected.
 
8. Find an image that you can copy onto the Clipboard and then press 
Ctrl+C (Windows) or Ô+C (Mac) to copy the image.
 
9. Return to InDesign and paste the image into the table cell by pressing 
Ctrl+V (Windows) or Ô+V (Mac).
 
 The image appears in the table cell, and the height and/or width of the 
cell changes based on the dimensions of the image. Make sure that the 
insertion point is active in the cell if you have problems pasting the 
image.
Not only can you change the table itself; you can customize the cells within 
the table. Choose Table➪Cell Options➪Text to open the Cell Options dialog 
box. You can also make changes to each cell by using the Paragraph panel. 
Similarly, you can change the number of rows, columns, and their widths 
and heights with the Tables panel. Open the Tables panel by choosing 
Window➪Type & Tables➪Table.

InDesign allows you to import tables from other programs, such as Excel. If 
you have a spreadsheet you want to import, choose File➪Place command. 
The spreadsheet is imported into InDesign as a table that you can further 
edit as necessary.
Creating table styles
If you’ve spent time customizing strokes, fills, and spacing for your table, 
you certainly want to save it as a style. Creating a table style allows you to 
re-use your table setup for future tables. To create a table style, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Make a table look the way you want.
 
 The easiest way to create a table style is to go through the table setup 
and make a table look the way you want it at completion.
 
2. Select the table.
 
 Click and drag to select it with the text tool.
 
3. Choose Window➪Type & Tables➪Table Styles.
 
 The Table Styles panel appears.
 
4. Hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key and click the 
Create New Style button at the bottom of the Table Styles panel.
 
 The New Table Style dialog box appears.
 
5. Name the style and click OK.
 
 Your table attributes are saved as a style.
If you want to edit table style attributes, you can simply double-click the 
named style in the Table Styles panel. (Make sure nothing is selected.)
Looking at Text on a Path
You can create some interesting effects with text on a path. Using the Type 
On a Path tool, you can have text curve along a line or shape. This feature 
is particularly useful when you want to create interesting titling effects on a 
page.
To create text on a path, follow these steps:
 
1. Use the Pen tool to create a path on the page.
 
 Create at least one curve on the path after you create it. (See Chapter 3 
of this minibook to find out how to wield the Pen tool with confidence).
 
2. Click and hold the Type tool to select the Type On a Path tool.

3. Move the cursor near the path you created.
 
 When you move the cursor near a path, a + symbol appears next to the 
cursor. This cursor means you can click and start typing on the path.
 
4. Click when you see the + icon and type some text onto the path.
 
 An insertion point appears at the beginning of the path after you click, 
and you can then add text along the path. You select type on a path 
as you would normally select other text: by dragging over the text to 
highlight it.
To change properties for type on a path, you can use the Type On a Path 
Options dialog box, which you access by choosing Type➪Type On a 
Path➪Options. The Type On a Path Options dialog box allows you to use 
effects to modify how each character is placed on the path. You can also 
flip the text, change character spacing, and change how the characters align 
to the path in the Align drop-down list, or to the stroke of the path in the 
To Path drop-down list. Play with the settings to see how they affect your 
type. Click OK to apply your changes; to undo anything you don’t like, press 
Ctrl+Z or Ô+Z.

T
his chapter shows you how to put graphics and text together so that 
you can start creating page layouts. Interesting and creative page lay-
outs help draw interest to the pictures and words contained within the pub-
lication. An interesting layout motivates more of the audience to read the 
text you place on a page.
Importing Images
You can add several kinds of image files to an InDesign document. Some of the 
most common kinds are JPEG, TIF, GIF, and PSD. Images are imported into gra-
phic frames, which are instantly created when you add the image to the page.
InDesign allows you to make specific settings, such as those for quality, link-
age, and color management, when importing an image. You can adjust addi-
tional settings when you import an image with the Image Import Options 
dialog box. In the “Importing other InDesign documents” section, you see 
how to change various import options, but for now, to import an image into 
InDesign (without changing the import settings), follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that nothing on the page is selected.
 
 If an object on the page is selected, click an empty area so that the 
element is deselected before you proceed.
 
2. Choose File➪Place.
 
 The Place dialog box opens, where you can browse through your hard 
drive for image files to import. This dialog box allows you to import 
various kinds of files into InDesign, not just images.

Importing Images
154
 
3. Select the image that you want to import and click Open.
 
 The Place dialog box closes, and your cursor displays a thumbnail of the 
image you selected.
 
 In InDesign, you can import multiple images at one time. Simply hold 
down the Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) key and select multiple files in the 
Place dialog box.
 
4. Move the cursor to where you want the upper-left corner of the first 
image to be placed on the page and then click the mouse.
 
 If you’ve selected multiple images, you can use the left and right arrow 
keys to navigate through the thumbnail images in your loaded cursor. 
Every time you click, the next image is placed, until there are no more 
images to place.
 
 The image(s) is imported and placed into the publication as a graphic 
frame. You can now resize, move, and modify the image.
Don’t worry if the image imports and is too large for the layout or needs 
to be cropped — for more information about selecting graphic frames and 
modifying them, check out Chapter 6 of this minibook. To find out about 
importing and working with text and stories, see Chapter 4 of this minibook.
 
It’s sometimes easier to create a graphic frame and then add an image to it. 
Now in CS4, you can set fitting properties before you import an image. To set 
the fitting properties in a blank frame, choose Object➪Fitting➪Frame Fitting 
Options.
Importing PDFs
When you import PDF files, you can preview and crop the pages by using the 
Place PDF dialog box (choose File➪Place). You can import only one page at a 
time, so you’ll need to use the Forward and Back buttons under the preview 
to select a page to place in the publication. Also, you can’t import any video, 
sound, or buttons, and you can’t edit the PDF after it’s imported into InDesign.
The Place PDF dialog box offers the following options:
 
✦ Crop: You can crop the page you’re importing using this drop-down list. 
Some options are unavailable because they depend on what’s in the PDF 
you’re importing. The hatched outline in the preview shows you the 
crop marks.
 
✦ Transparent Background: If you select this check box, the PDF back-
ground is made transparent so that elements on the InDesign page show 
through. The PDF background is imported as solid white if this option 
isn’t selected.

Importing other InDesign documents
Starting in InDesign CS3, you had the opportunity to place an InDesign docu-
ment inside another. This feature, though really neat, could possibly cause a 
series of issues related to nesting images and fonts inside another document, 
inside yet another document. Yet, Adobe has done a pretty good job making 
this as error-free as possible.
Here’s how you can take advantage of this feature:
 
1. With a document open, choose File➪Place, or use the keyboard short-
cut Ctrl+D (Windows) or Ô+D (Mac).
 
 The Place dialog box appears.
 
2. Check the Show Import Options check box at the bottom of the Place 
dialog box.
 
3. Navigate to an InDesign file and double-click to open it.
 
 The Place InDesign Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 
5-1, offering you the opportunity to choose which page(s) you want to 
place.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Choose 
which 
pages to 
import in 
the Place 
InDesign

dialog box.
 
 
4. Click OK.
 
5. Click the page to place the document.
 
 If you’re placing a document with multiple pages, click again to place 
each additional page.

Linking and Embedding Images
156
Linking and Embedding Images
You can either have your images linked to a publication or embedded within 
it. Instead of importing images or files directly into InDesign and embed-
ding them, you can link the content to the file instead. Here’s the difference 
between linking and embedding:
 
✦ Linking: The image that appears in the InDesign document is basically a 
preview of the actual image file stored on your hard drive. If the file you 
linked to your InDesign document is changed (the name and location 
must remain the same), the link breaks and the image no longer appears 
in your layout.
 
✦ Embedding: The image is copied into and saved within the publication 
itself. It doesn’t matter where the file you imported is or if you alter that file 
because an embedded image is stored within the InDesign document itself.
When you print or export the publication you’re working on, the information 
is added to the document from linked files (if you have any). This means you 
have to be careful to keep all your linked files together with the InDesign 
document, particularly if you send or save it to a different location. You can 
update the links for an image by selecting it in the Links panel and choosing 
Relink from the Links panel menu. You’re prompted to find that file on your 
hard drive so that the file can be linked to the new location.
 
If you choose to use embedded images instead of linked images, be aware 
that your publication’s file size increases because of the extra data that’s 
being stored within it.
Images 48K or smaller are automatically embedded within the publication. If 
an imported image is larger than that, the file is linked. To find out what files 
are embedded or linked, look at the Links panel. Choose Window➪Links to 
open the panel and see whether you have any linked or embedded images 
listed in the panel.
You can choose to embed a file using the Links panel menu. Click the 
triangle in the upper-right corner to access the panel menu and select 
Embed Link if you want a linked file to be embedded within the document. 
Alternatively, choose Unembed Link from the Link panel menu to link a file 
instead of having it embedded in the document.
Setting Image Quality and Display
You can set different quality settings for how your images import and display 
in the workspace. These settings may help speed up your work (set at a lower 
quality) or give you a better idea of the finished print project (set at a higher 
quality). These settings are applicable only to how you see the images while 
using InDesign: They have no bearing over the final printed or exported product.

Book II
Chapter 5
Understanding 
Page Layout
Selecting Images
157
To change image display quality, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Display 
Performance (Windows) or InDesign➪Preferences➪Display Performance 
(Mac). You can then select one of the following settings from the Default 
View drop-down list:
 
✦ Fast Display: In order to optimize performance, the entire image or 
graphic is grayed out.
 
✦ Typical Display (Default): This setting tends to make bitmaps look a 
little blocky, particularly if you zoom in. The speed of zooming in and 
out is increased if you select this option. InDesign uses a preview that 
it’s created (or was already imported with the file) to display the image 
on the screen.
 
✦ High Quality Display: The original image is used to display on-screen. 
This allows you to preview a very accurate depiction of what the final 
layout will look like, but you may find that InDesign runs slowly when 
you use the High Quality option.
Notice the difference among these settings in Figure 5-2.
 
Figure 5-2: 
From left to 
right: Fast 
Display, 
Typical 
Display, and

To change the display for individual images, select the graphic frame and 
choose View➪Display Performance. Then choose one of the three options 
from the submenu.
Selecting Images
After you import an image into your document, you can select images in sev-
eral different ways with the Selection or Direct Selection tools. This is useful 
when you want to select and edit just the graphic frame, or just the image 
inside it.
To select and then edit an image on the page, follow these steps:
 
1. Place an image on a page by importing it or pasting it into InDesign.
 
 The image is placed within a graphic frame.

Selecting Images
158
 
2. With the Selection tool, drag one of the corner handles on the graphic 
frame.
 
 The graphic frame is resized but not the image. The image appears to be 
cropped because you resized the graphic frame — but the image remains 
the same size within the frame, as shown in the center of Figure 5-3.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ô+Z (Mac) to undo 
the changes to the image.
 
 The image returns to its original appearance on the page.
 
4. With the Direct Selection tool, click the picture and then drag one of 
the corner handles.
 
 The image inside the graphic frame resizes, but the graphic frame 
remains the same size.

5. Click within the image and drag to move the image within the graphic 
frame-bounding box.
 
 A hand appears when you move the cursor over the graphic; when you 
move the image just past the edge of the graphic frame boundaries, that 
part of the image isn’t visible anymore, as shown on the right of Figure 5-3.
 
When repositioning a graphic within a frame, click and hold. When you do 
so, the entire image appears (screened outside the frame area), as shown in 
the image on the right in Figure 5-3. Seeing the dimmed image allows you to 
crop more effectively.

You can set the frame or image to resize by choosing Object➪Fitting and 
selecting the option that you want. You can even set this fitting before 
you place an image, which is especially helpful when creating templates. 
Resize before an image is placed by choosing Object➪Fitting➪Frame Fitting 
Options.
 
Talk about an incredible new feature! The new Links panel is introduced in 
Chapter 1 of this minibook, but you don’t realize the importance of this handy, 
improved feature until you start placing a lot of images in multiple page docu-
ments. The Links panel can help you find images within your document, open 
images so that you can edit them, and view important information about the 
selected image. See Figure 5-4 to help you to navigate this improved panel.

Manipulating Text and Graphics in Layout
InDesign offers many tools that help you work with text and graphics 
together in a layout. From the tools in the toolbox to commands to panel 
options, InDesign offers you an immense amount of control over how you 
can manipulate graphics and text in a spread.

Page orientation and size
When you create a new document, you can set the page orientation and size. 
If you ever need to change your settings after you’ve created a document, 
choose File➪Document Setup and change the following options. (These set-
tings affect all pages in your document.)
 
✦ Page Orientation: Select either Landscape or Portrait. One of the first 
things you decide upon when you create a new document is how your 
pages will be oriented. A landscape page is wider than it is tall; a portrait 
orientation is taller than it is wide.
 
✦ Page Size: Choose from many standardized preset sizes, such as Letter, 
Legal, and Tabloid. Alternatively, you can set a custom page size for the 
document. Make sure that you properly set the page size so that it fits 
the kind of paper you need to print on.
Margins, columns, and gutters
Margins, columns, and gutters help divide a page for layout and confine its 
dimensions:
 
✦ Margin: The area between the edge of the page and the main printed 
area. Together, the four margins (top, bottom, left, and right) look like 
a rectangle around the page’s perimeter. Margins don’t print when you 
print or export the publication.
 
✦ Column: Columns divide a page into sections used for laying out text 
and graphics on a page. A page has at least one column when you start, 
which is between the margins. You can add additional column guides to 
this, which are represented by a pair of lines separated by a gutter area. 
Column guides aren’t printed when you print or export the publication.
 
✦ Gutter: The space between two columns on the page. A gutter prevents 
columns from running together. You can define the gutter’s width in 
Object➪Text Frame Options; see Chapter 4 of this minibook for more 
information.
You can set margins and columns when you create a new document, which 
we discuss in Chapter 2 of this minibook. However, you can also modify 
margins and columns after the document’s been created and specify differ-
ent values for each page. You can modify the gutter, which is the width of the 
space between each column.
You can change margins and columns by setting new values in the Margins 
and Columns dialog box. Choose Layout➪Margins and Columns and then 
modify each individual page.

Book II
Chapter 5
Understanding 
Page Layout
Manipulating Text and Graphics in Layout
161
 
Margins and columns are useful for placing and aligning elements on a page. 
These guides can have objects snap to them, enabling you to accurately 
align multiple objects on a page.
Using guides and snapping
Using guides when you’re creating your page layouts is a good idea because 
guides help you more precisely align elements on a page and position 
objects in the layout. Aligning objects by eyeballing them is difficult because 
you often can’t tell if an object is out of alignment by a small amount unless 
you’re zoomed in to a large percentage.
 
Make sure that snapping is enabled by choosing View➪Grids and 
Guides➪Snap to Guides. Snapping makes guides and grids useful. When you 
drag the object close to the grid, the object attaches to the guideline like it’s 
a magnet. Getting an object aligned to a guide isn’t easy or even possible to 
do by eyeballing it, so snapping is essential when using guides.
Because guides are very useful in creating a layout, check out the following 
kinds available in InDesign (see to Figure 5-5):
 
✦ Column guides: These guides are set when you open a new document 
in InDesign. Column guides evenly distribute the page into columns and 
can be used to align text frames in a document. They don’t always have 
to be equally spaced the way they’re originally placed on a page. You 
can drag columns to a new location manually. Simply click a column 
guide directly on a line and drag the line to a new location. The cursor 
changes to a double-ended arrow while you drag the column guide to a 
new location.
 
✦ Margin guides: Margin guides are the guidelines discussed in the previ-
ous section that define the area between the edge of the page and the 
main printable area.
 
✦ Ruler guides: Ruler guides are ones you manually define; they can be 
used to align graphics, measure an object, or specify the location of a 
particular asset you want to lay out. See Chapter 2 of this minibook for 
details about adding ruler guides to the workspace.
 
✦ Smart guides: As previously mentioned, smart guides offer the ability to 
align objects on your InDesign page to other objects or even to the page. 
Smart object alignment allows for easy snapping to page item centers or 
edges or page centers. In addition to snapping, smart guides give feed-
back to the user indicating which object you’re snapping.
To find out how to show and hide grids and guides, see Chapter 2 of this 
minibook.

Don’t forget that in InDesign CS4, you delete all guides at once by right-clicking 
the ruler (Windows) or Control-clicking the ruler (Mac) and selecting Delete 
All Guides from the contextual menu.
Locking objects and guides
You can lock elements, such as objects and guides, in place. This feature is 
particularly useful after you’ve carefully aligned elements on a page. Locking 
objects or guides prevents you from accidentally moving them from that 
position.
To lock an element, follow these steps:
 
1. Use a drawing tool to create an object on a page and then select it 
with the Selection tool.
 
 A bounding box with handles appears when the object is selected.

Book II
Chapter 5
Understanding 
Page Layout
Merging Text and Graphics
163
 
2. Choose Object➪Lock Position.
 
 The object is locked in position. Now when you try to use the Selection 
or Direct Selection tools to move the object, the object doesn’t move 
from its current position.
To lock guides in place, follow these steps:
 
1. Drag a couple ruler guides onto the page by clicking within a ruler 
and dragging toward the page.
 
 A line appears on the page. (If rulers aren’t visible around the paste-
board, choose View➪Rulers.)
 
2. Drag a ruler guide to a new location if needed; when you’re 
happy with the ruler guides’ placements, choose View➪Grids and 
Guides➪Lock Guides.
 
 All guides in the workspace are locked. If you try selecting a guide and 
moving it, the guide remains in its present position. If you have any 
column guides on the page, they’re locked as well.
 
Use layers in your publications for organization. Layers are a lot like trans-
parencies that lay on top of each other, so they can be used for stacking 
elements on a page. For example, you may want to stack graphics or arrange 
similar items (such as images or text) onto the same layer. Each layer has 
its own color of bounding box, which helps you tell which item is on which 
corresponding layer. For more information on layers in general, see Book III, 
Chapter 8.
Merging Text and Graphics
When you have text and graphics together on a page, they should flow and 
work with each other in order to create an aesthetic layout. Luckily, you can 
work with text wrap to achieve a visual flow between text and graphics. In 
this section, you discover how to wrap text around images and graphics in 
your publications.
Wrapping objects with text
Images can have text wrapped around them, as shown in Figure 5-6. 
Wrapping is a typical feature of page layout in print and on the Web. You can 
choose different text wrap options by using the Text Wrap panel, which you 
open by choosing Window➪Text Wrap. Use the five buttons at the top of 
the panel to set what kind of text wrapping you want to use for the selected 
object. Below the buttons are text fields where you can enter offset values 
for the text wrap. The fields are grayed out if the option isn’t available.

in several 
ways.
 
(a) No text wrap
(b) Wrap around bounding box
(c) Wrap around object shape
(d) Jump object
(e) Jump to next column
The drop-down list at the bottom of the Text Wrap panel is used to choose 
from various contour options. Choose from the following options to wrap 
text around an object’s shape:
 
✦ No Text Wrap: Click this button to use the default setting or to remove 
any text wrapping from the selected object.
 
✦ Wrap around Bounding Box: Click this button to wrap text around all 
sides of the bounding box of the object.
 
 Offset: Enter an amount to offset the text from wrapping around the object.
 
✦ Wrap around Object Shape: Click this button to wrap text around the 
edges of an object.
 
 Contour Options: Select a contour from this drop-down list, which tells 
InDesign how the edges of the image are determined. You can choose 
from various vector paths or the edges to be detected around an object 
or image with transparency.
 
 Top Offset: Enter a value for the top offset modifier to offset the text 
wrapping around the object.

Book II
Chapter 5
Understanding 
Page Layout
Merging Text and Graphics
165
 
✦ Jump Object: Click this button to have the text wrapping around the 
image jump from above the image to below it, with no text wrapping to 
the left or right of the object in the column.
 
✦ Jump to Next Column: Click this button to cause text to end above the 
image and then jump to the next column. No text is wrapped to the left 
or right of the image.
 
 Offset: Enter offset values for text wrapping on all sides of the object.
To add text wrapping to an object (a drawing or image), follow these steps:
 
1. Create a text frame on the page.
 
 Add text to the text frame by typing, pasting text from elsewhere, or 
filling it with placeholder text. This text will wrap around the image, so 
make sure that the text frame is slightly larger than the graphic frame 
you’ll use.
 
2. With the Selection tool, select a graphic frame on the page and move 
it over the text frame.
 
 Bounding box handles appear around the edges of the image or graphic.
 
3. Choose Window➪Text Wrap to open the Text Wrap panel.
 
 The Text Wrap panel opens.
 
4. With the graphic frame still selected, click the Wrap around Object 
Shape button.
 
 The text wraps around the image instead of hiding behind it.
 
5. If you’re working with an image that has a transparent background, 
choose Detect Edges or Alpha Channel from the Contour Options 
drop-down list.
 
 The text wraps around the edges of the image, as shown in the (c) Wrap 
around Object Shape example in Figure 5-6.
Modifying a text wrap
If you’ve applied a text wrap around an object (as we show you how to do in 
the preceding section), you can then modify that text wrap. If you have an 
image with a transparent background around which you’ve wrapped text, 
InDesign created a path around the edge of the image; if you have a shape 
you created with the drawing tools, InDesign automatically uses those paths 
to wrap text around.
 
Before proceeding with the following steps, be sure that the object uses the 
Wrap around Object Shape text wrap. (If not, open the Text Wrap panel and 
click the Wrap around Object Shape button to apply the text wrapping.) 
Remember to choose Detect Edges if you’re using an image with a transpar-
ent background.

Working with Pages and the Pages Panel
166
To modify the path around an image with text wrapping by using the Direct 
Selection tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object using the Direct Selection tool.
 
 The image is selected, and you can see the path around the object.
 
2. Drag one of the anchor points on the path using the Direct Selection tool.
 
 The path is modified according to how you move the point. (For more 
about manipulating paths, take a look at Chapter 3 of this minibook.) 
The text wrapping immediately changes, based on the modifications you 
make to the path around the object.
 
3. Select the Delete Anchor Point tool from the toolbox and delete one of 
the anchor points.
 
 The path changes again, and the text wrapping modifies around the 
object accordingly.
 
You can also use the Offset values in the Text Wrap panel to determine the 
distance between the wrapping text and the edge of the object. Just increase 
the point values to move the text farther away from the object’s edge.
Working with Pages and the Pages Panel
Pages are the central part of any publication. The page is where the visible 
part of your publication is actually created. Navigating and controlling pages 
is a large part of what you do in InDesign. The Pages panel allows you to 
select, move, and navigate through pages in a publication. When you use 
default settings, pages are created as facing pages, which means they’re laid 
out as two-page spreads. Otherwise, pages are laid out individually. This is 
reflected, and can also be changed, in the Pages panel.
The Pages panel, which you open by choosing Window➪Pages, also allows 
you to add new pages to the document, duplicate pages, or delete a page. 
The Pages panel, as shown in Figure 5-7, contains two main areas: the master 
pages section (upper section) and the section containing the document’s 
pages (lower section).
To discover more about master pages and how they differ from regular 
pages in your document, see the “Using Master Spreads in Page Layout” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
Selecting and moving pages
Use the Pages panel to select a page or spread in your publication. Select a 
page by clicking the page. If you Ctrl-click (Windows) or Ô-click (Mac) pages, 
you can select more than one page at a time. The Pages panel also allows you 

Book II
Chapter 5
Understanding 
Page Layout
Working with Pages and the Pages Panel
167
to move pages to a new position in the document. Select a page in the docu-
ment pages area of the panel and then drag it where you want to move the 
page. A small line and changed cursor indicate where the page will be moved. 
You can move a page in between two pages in a spread; a hollow line indicates 
where you’re moving the page. If you move a page after a spread, a solid line 
appears. Release the mouse button to move the page to the new location.
Adding and deleting pages
You can also add new pages to the publication by using the Pages panel. To 
add a new page, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Pages to open the Pages panel.
 
 The Pages panel opens.
 
2. Click the Create New Page button.
 
 A new page is added to the document.
 
3. Select one of the pages in the Pages panel.
 
 The selected page is highlighted in the Pages panel.
 
4. Click the Create New Page button again.
 
 A new page is added following the selected page.
 
To delete a page, select the page in the Pages panel and click the Delete 
Selected Pages button. The selected page is removed from the document.

Now in InDesign CS4, you can add, delete, move pages, and more by choosing 
Layout➪Pages.
Numbering your pages
When you’re working with longer documents, adding page numbers before 
you print or export the publication is a good idea. You don’t have to add 
them manually: InDesign has a special tool that allows you to number pages 
automatically. This tool is particularly useful when you move pages around 
the document. You don’t have to keep track of updating the numbering when 
you make these kinds of edits.
To number pages, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a text frame on the page where you want the page number to 
be added.
 
2. Double-click the text frame so that the insertion point is blinking in 
the frame.
 
3. Choose Type➪Insert Special Character➪Markers➪Current Page 
Number.
 
 The current page number appears in the text frame you selected. If 
you added the page number to a master page, the master pages’ letter 
appears in the field instead.
If you want page numbers to appear on all pages in the document, add the 
text frame to a master page. Remember that page numbers are added only to 
the pages in your document associated with that master page. If you add the 
page number on a regular page in the document, it adds the page number 
only to that single page.
 
To modify automatic numbering settings, choose Layout➪Numbering and 
Section Options. You can choose to have numbering start from a specific 
number or use a different style, such as Roman numerals.
Using Master Spreads in Page Layout
Master pages are a lot like templates that you use to format your page lay-
outs. The settings, such as margins and columns, are applied to each layout 
that the master page is applied to. If you put a page number on a master 
page, it also appears on each page that uses the layout. You can have more 
than one master page in a single publication, and you can choose which 
pages use a particular master page.

Book II
Chapter 5
Understanding 
Page Layout
Using Master Spreads in Page Layout
169
A master page or spread typically contains parts of a layout that are applied 
to many pages. It has elements that are used on many pages, such as page 
numbering, text frames to enter text into, background images, or a heading 
that’s used on every page. You can’t edit the items you have on a master 
page on the pages assigned to it — you can edit those items on the master 
page only.
 
Master pages are lettered. The first master page is the A-Master by default. 
If you create a second master page, it’s the B-Master by default. When you 
create a new publication, the A-Master is applied to all the pages you ini-
tially open in the document. You can add pages at the end that don’t have a 
master applied to them.
Creating master pages and applying them to your publication enables you to 
create a reusable format for your publication, which can dramatically speed 
up your workflow when you put together documents with InDesign.
Creating a master spread
You may need more than one master page or master spread for your docu-
ment. You may have another series of pages that need a unique format. In 
this situation, you’d need to create a second master page. You can create a 
master page or a master spread from any other page in the publication, or 
you can create a new one with the Pages panel.
To create a master page using a page in the publication, do one of the 
following:
 
✦ Choose New Master from the Page panel’s menu and then click OK. A 
blank master page is created.
 
✦ Drag a page from the pages section of the panel into the master page 
section of the Pages panel. The document page turns into a master page.
 
If the page you’re trying to drag into the master pages section is part of a 
spread, select both pages in the spread before you drag it into the master 
pages section. You can drag individual pages into the master page section 
only if they’re not part of a spread.
Applying, removing, and deleting master pages
After you create a master page, you can apply it to a page. You can also 
remove a page from a master page layout as well as delete a master page 
altogether:

Using Master Spreads in Page Layout
170
 
✦ To add master page formatting to a page or spread in a publication: In 
the Pages panel, drag the master page you want to use from the master 
page section on top of the page you want to format in the document 
pages section. When you drag the master page on top of the page, it has 
a thick outline around it. Release the mouse button when you see this 
outline, and the formatting is applied to the page.
 
✦ To remove any master page applied to a document page: In the Pages 
panel, drag the None page from the master area in the Pages panel onto 
that document page. You may need to use the scroll bar in the master 
pages area of the Pages panel to find the None page.
 
✦ To delete a master page: In the Pages panel, select the unwanted master 
page and then choose Delete Master Spread from the panel menu.
 
This action permanently deletes the master page — you can’t get it back — 
so think carefully before deleting a master page.

Chapter 6: Clipping Paths, 
Transforming Objects, 
and Alignment
In This Chapter
✓ Transforming objects with the Transform panel
✓ Transforming objects with the Free Transform tool
✓ Rotating and scaling objects
✓ Shearing and reflecting objects
✓ Adding a clipping path
✓ Aligning and distributing objects in a layout
I
n this chapter, you discover several different ways to manipulate and 
arrange objects on a page. You find out how to use the Transform panel 
and other tools in the toolbox to transform objects on page layouts. You can 
make the same transformation in many different ways in InDesign, so for 
each way you can transform an object, we show you a couple different ways 
to do the same job.
Aligning and/or distributing objects and images helps you organize elements 
logically on a page. In this chapter, you find out how to align objects with 
the Align panel. In Chapter 5 of this minibook, we touch on vector paths. 
This chapter provides more information about clipping paths. We show you 
how to create a new path to use as a clipping path for an image in your 
document.
Working with Transformations
Chapter 3 of this minibook shows you how to transform graphic objects by 
skewing them. You can manipulate objects in InDesign in many other ways. 
You can transform an object by choosing Object➪Transform, the Transform 
panel, or the improved easier-to-use Free Transform tool.

Working with Transformations
172
Looking at the Transform panel
The Transform panel (as shown in Figure 6-1) is extremely useful for 
changing the way an image or graphic looks and also for changing the scale, 
rotation, or skew of the selected object. You can choose from a range of 
values for some of these modifiers or manually set your own by typing them.
The Transform panel offers the following information and functionality:
 
✦ Reference point: Indicates which handle is the reference for any trans-
formations you make. For example, if you reset the X and Y coordinates, 
the reference point is set to this position. In Figure 6-1, the reference 
point is in the center, as indicated by the solid square.
 
✦ Position: Change these values to reset the X and Y coordinate position 
of the selected object.
 
✦ Size: The W and H text fields are used to change the current dimensions 
of the object.
 
✦ Scale: Enter or choose a percentage from the Scale X Percentage and 
Scale Y Percentage drop-down lists to scale (resize) the object on either 
of these axes.
 
✦ Constraining proportions: Click the Constrain Proportions button to 
maintain the current proportions of the object that’s being scaled.
 
✦ Shearing: Enter or choose a negative or positive number to modify the 
shearing angle (skew) of the selected object.
 
✦ Rotation angle: Set a negative value to rotate the object clockwise; a 
positive value rotates the object counterclockwise.

When you’re scaling, shearing, or rotating an object in your layout, it trans-
forms based on the reference point in the Transform panel. For example, 
when you rotate an object, InDesign considers the reference point to be the 
center point of the rotation.
Click a new reference point square in the Transform panel to change the 
reference point of the graphic to the equivalent bounding box handle of the 
currently selected object.
 
You can access dialog boxes for each kind of transformation by choosing 
Object➪Transform. These dialog boxes have very similar functionality to the 
Transform panel.
Using the Free Transform tool
 
 The Free Transform tool is a multipurpose tool that allows you to transform 
objects in different ways. With the Free Transform tool, you can move, 
rotate, shear, reflect, and scale objects.
The different functions of the Free Transform Tool are represented in 
InDesign by different cursors, as shown in Figure 6-2.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Different 
cursors 
indicate 
options for 
using the 
Transform 
tool.
 
(a) Rotate
(b) Scale
(c) Scale
(d) Move
To move an object using the Free Transform tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Use the Selection tool to select an object on the page.
 
 You can use an object that’s already on the page or create a new shape 
using the drawing tools. When the object is selected, you’ll see handles 
around the edges.
 
2. Select the Free Transform tool from the toolbox.
 
 The cursor changes to the Free Transform tool.

Working with Transformations
174
 
3. Move the cursor over the middle of the selected object.
 
 The cursor changes its appearance to indicate that you can drag to 
move the object (refer to Figure 6-2). If you move the cursor outside the 
edges of the object, the cursor changes when the other tools, such as 
rotate, scale, and shear, become active.
 
4. Drag the object to a different location.
 
 The object is moved to a new location on the page.
Rotating objects
You can rotate an object by using the Free Transform tool or the Transform 
panel. Using the panel allows you to enter a specific degree that you want 
the object to rotate. The Free Transform tool lets you visually manipulate 
the object on the page.
To rotate an image by using the Free Transform tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an object on the page with the Selection tool.
 
 Handles appear around the edges of the object. You can rotate any 
object on the page.
 
2. Select the Free Transform tool in the toolbox and move it near the 
handle of an object outside the bounding box.
 
 The cursor changes when you move it close to the handle of an object. 
For rotation, you must keep the cursor just outside the object.
 
3. When the cursor changes to the rotate cursor, drag to rotate the 
object.
 
 Drag the cursor until the object is rotated the correct amount.
Alternatively, you can use the Rotate tool to spin an object by following 
these steps:
 
1. With the object selected, select the Rotate tool in the toolbox and 
move the cursor near the object.
 
 The cursor looks similar to a cross hair.
 
2. Click the cursor anywhere on the page near the object.
 
 The point the object rotates around is set on the page.
 
3. Drag the cursor outside the object.
 
 The object rotates around the reference point you set on the page. Hold 
the Shift key if you want to rotate in 45-degree increments.
You can also rotate objects by using the Transform panel. Here’s how:

Book II
Chapter 6
Clipping, 
Transforming, 
and Alignment
Working with Transformations
175
 
1. Select an object on the page with the Selection tool.
 
 The bounding box with handles appears around the selected object.
 
2. If the Transform panel isn’t open, choose Window➪Object & 
Layout➪Transform.
 
 The Transform panel appears.
 
3. Select a value from the Rotation Angle drop-down list or click the text 
field and enter a percentage.
 
 The object rotates to the degree that you set in the Transform panel. 
Negative angles (in degrees) rotate the image clockwise, and positive 
angles (in degrees) rotate the image counterclockwise.
Scaling objects
 
 You can scale objects by using the Transform panel (refer to Figure 6-1), the 
Scale tool, or the Free Transform tool. The Transform panel allows you to 
set exact width and height dimensions that you want to scale the object to,
 
 just like you can set exact percentages for rotating.
To scale an object by using the Free Transform tool or the Scale tool, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select an object on the page.
 
 A bounding box appears around the object.
 
2. Select the Free Transform tool or the Scale tool from the toolbox.
 
3. Move the cursor directly over a corner handle.
 
 The cursor changes into a double-ended arrow (refer to Figure 6-2).
 
4. Drag outward to increase the size of the object; drag inward to 
decrease the size of the object.
 
 If you want to scale the image proportionally, hold down the Shift key 
while you drag.
 
5. Release the mouse button when the object is scaled to the correct size.
To resize an object using the Transform panel, select the object and enter 
new values into the W and H text fields in the panel. The object then resizes 
to those exact dimensions.
Shearing objects
Shearing an object means that you’re skewing it horizontally, slanting it to 
the left or right. A sheared object may appear to have perspective or depth 
because of this modification. You use the Shear tool to create a shearing 
effect, as shown in Figure 6-3.

Working with Transformations
176
 
Figure 6-3: 
The original 
image is on 
the left, and 
the sheared 
image is on 
the right.
 
Follow these steps to shear an object:
 
1. Select an object on the page.
 
 The bounding box appears around the object that is selected.
 
 2. Choose the Shear tool in the toolbox.
 
 
 The cursor changes so it looks similar to a cross hair. Click once 
on the corner of the object that you want to shear from, and a cross hair 
appears as you see in Figure 6-3.
 
3. Click anywhere above or below the object and drag.
 
 The selected object shears depending on the direction that you drag. 
Press the Shift key while you drag to shear an object in 45-degree 
increments.
 
To shear objects with the Free Transform tool, begin dragging a handle and 
then hold down Ctrl+Alt (Windows) or Ô+Option (Mac) while dragging.
You can also enter an exact value into the Transform panel to shear an 
object. Select the object and then enter a positive or negative value into the 
panel representing the amount of slant you want to apply to the object.
 
You can apply shear by choosing Object➪Transform➪Shear to display the 
Shear dialog box.
Reflecting objects
You can reflect objects to create mirror images by using the Transform 
panel menu. The menu provides several additional options for manipulating 
objects.
Follow these steps to reflect an object:
 
1. Select an object on the page and then press F9 to open the Transform 
panel.
 
 The object’s bounding box and handles appear. The Transform panel 
shows the current values of the selected object.

2. Click the panel menu in the Transform panel.
 
 The menu opens, revealing many options available for manipulating 
the object.
 
3. Select Flip Horizontal from the Transform panel menu.
 
 The object on the page flips on its horizontal axis. You can repeat this 
step with other reflection options in the menu, such as Flip Vertical.
 
You can also reflect objects with the Free Transform tool by dragging a 
corner handle past the opposite end of the object. The object reflects on 
its axis.
Understanding Clipping Paths
Clipping paths allow you to create a path that crops a part of an image based 
upon the path, such as removing the background area of an image. This 
shape can be one that you create using InDesign, or you can import an image 
that already has a clipping path. InDesign can also use an existing alpha or 
mask layer, such as one created using Photoshop or Fireworks, and treat it 
like a clipping path. Clipping paths are useful when you want to block out 
areas of an image and have text wrap around the leftover image.
You can create a clipping path right in InDesign by using a drawing tool, 
such as the Pen tool. You use the tool to create a shape and then paste an 
image into this shape on the page. Here’s how:
 
1. Choose File➪Place and browse to locate an image.
 
 2. With the Pen tool, create a path right on top of the image.
 
 
 The path should be created so that it can contain the image.
 
3. With the Selection tool, click to select the image and then choose 
File➪Cut.
 
4. Select the shape you created in Step 1 and choose Edit➪Paste Into.
 
 The image is pasted into the selected shape that you drew with the 
Pen tool.
Arranging Objects on the Page
In other chapters of this minibook, we show you how to arrange objects on 
the page. However, you can arrange text or objects in a few other ways. This 
section covers the additional ways you can arrange objects, which gives you 
more control over the placement of elements in your document.

Arranging Objects on the Page
178
Aligning objects
New in CS4, you have the ability to align visually without the need of any 
extra tools or panels. If you keep smart guides activated (they’re on by 
default), when you use the Selection tool to select and move objects around 
your page, guides appear automatically. These guides appear when the 
selected object is aligned with other objects on the page or with the page 
itself. If these pesky guides start to bother you, choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Guides & Pasteboard (Windows) or InDesign➪Guides & Pasteboard (Mac) 
and turn off the all four options underneath the Smart Guide Options heading.
You can also align objects on a page with the Align panel (choose 
Window➪Object & Layout➪Align). This panel gives you control over how 
elements align to one another or to the overall page. The Align panel has 
many buttons to control selected objects. Mouse over a button to see its 
ToolTip describing how that button aligns elements.
 
If you’re not sure what each button does after reading the associated 
ToolTip, look at the icon on the button. It’s sometimes helpful in depicting 
what the Align button does to the selected objects.
Here’s how you align elements on the page:
 
1. Select several objects on the page with the Selection tool.
 
 Hold the Shift key while clicking each object to select several objects.
 
 Each of the objects is selected when you click them on the page. If you 
don’t have a few objects on a page, quickly create a couple new objects 
by using the drawing tools.
 
2. Choose Window➪Object & Layout➪Align.
 
 The Align panel opens.
 
3. Select the kind of alignment you want to apply to the selected objects.
 
 Try clicking the Align Vertical Centers button. Each of your selected 
objects aligns to the vertical center point on the page.
Distributing objects
In the preceding step list, we show you how to align a few objects on a page, 
which is easy enough. However, what if the objects that you’re aligning 
aren’t distributed evenly? Maybe their centers are lined up, but there’s a 
large gap between two of the images and a narrow gap between the other 
ones. In that case, you need to distribute objects as well as align them. 

Book II
Chapter 6
Clipping, 
Transforming, 
and Alignment
Arranging Objects on the Page
179
Distribute objects on the page to space them relative to the page or each 
other in different ways. Here’s how:
 
1. Select objects on a page that are neither aligned nor evenly distrib-
uted by using the Selection tool while holding the Shift key.
 
 The objects are selected when you click each one. All the objects you 
select will be aligned to each other on the page.
 
2. If the Align panel isn’t open, choose Window➪Object & Layout➪Align.
 
 The Align panel opens.
 
3. Click the Distribute Horizontal Centers button and then click the 
Align Vertical Centers button directly above it on the Align panel.
The selected objects are distributed evenly and aligned horizontally on 
the page.
Don’t forget about the cool new Multiple Place feature in InDesign CS4 that 
allows you to distribute and align on the fly! Try this handy new feature:
 
1. Choose File➪Place.
 
2. Press Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac), select multiple images, and then 
click the Open button.
 
3. Before clicking to place the images, hold down Ctrl+Shift (Windows) 
or Ô+Shift (Mac).
 
 The cursor appears as a grid, as shown in Figure 6-4.

C
olor is an important and complicated subject, especially in page layout; 
however, you probably already understand many of the concepts 
because the media bombards you with advertisements all the time. If you 
think about the advertisements you remember the most, you get an idea of 
the kinds of things that are successful in catching someone’s attention. 
These ads often rely on color to relay an effective message. The success of 
printed ads greatly relies on how color is used in the layout. Color greatly 
enhances the message being relayed to readers. In this chapter, you find out 
some of the fundamental aspects of working with color and the basics on 
how to prepare a document for printing.
 
For more information on general subjects about color, see Book I, Chapter 7, 
which covers subjects, such as color modes, inks, printers, and basic color 
correction across the programs in the Adobe Creative Suite.
Selecting Color with Color Controls
You have several different color modes and options when working in 
InDesign. Because color in print media can be quite a science, it’s important 
to have a lot of control over how your documents print on the page. In 
Chapter 3 of this minibook, we show you how to add color to drawings with 
the Color panel. In this section, we cover using the Color panel to choose 
colors and to apply them to the elements on your page.

Understanding Color Models
182
Swatches are used in many of the other chapters in this minibook. It’s a 
good idea to use swatches whenever possible because swatches use named 
colors that a service provider can match exactly. Swatches can be exactly 
the same in appearance as any color you choose that’s unnamed, but a 
swatch establishes a link between the color on the page and the name of a 
color, such as a Pantone color number. Discover more about these kinds of 
color in the later section, “Using Color Swatches and Libraries.”
You can use color controls for choosing colors for selections in the 
document:
 
✦ Stroke color: The Stroke color control allows you to choose colors for 
strokes and paths in InDesign. A hollow box represents the Stroke color 
control.
 
✦ Fill color: The Fill color control allows you to choose colors for filling 
shapes. A solid square box represents the Fill color control.
 
 You can toggle between the Fill and Stroke color controls by clicking 
them. Alternatively, you can press X on the keyboard to toggle between 
selected controls.
 
✦ Text color: When you’re working with text, a different color control 
becomes active. The Text color control is visible and displays the cur-
rently selected text color. Text can have both the stroke and fill colored.
To apply colors to selections, you can click the Apply color button below 
the color controls in the toolbox. Alternatively, you can select and click a 
color swatch.
 
The default colors in InDesign are a black stroke and no color for the fill. Go 
back to the default colors at any time by pressing D. This shortcut works 
while on any tool except the Type tool.
Understanding Color Models
You can use any of three kinds of color models in InDesign: CMYK (Cyan, 
Magenta, Yellow, Black), RGB (Red, Green, Blue), and LAB colors (L for 
lightness, and A and B for the color-opponent dimensions of the color 
space). A color model is a system used for representing each color as a set 
of numbers or letters (or both). The best color model to use depends on 
how you plan to print or display your document:
 
✦ If you’re creating a PDF that will be distributed electronically and 
probably won’t be printed, use the RGB color model. RGB is how colors 
are displayed on a computer monitor.

Book II
Chapter 7
Understanding 
Color and Printing
Using Color Swatches and Libraries
183
 
✦ You must use the CMYK color model if you’re working with process 
color: Instead of having inks that match specified colors, four ink colors 
are layered to simulate a particular color. Note that the colors on the 
monitor may differ from what’s actually printed. Sample swatch books 
and numbers can help you determine what colors you need to use in 
your document to match what will be printed in the end.
 
✦ If you know that the document needs to be printed by professionals who 
determine what each color is before it’s printed, it doesn’t matter 
whether you use RGB, Pantone (Pantone Matching System), or LAB 
colors. Make sure that you use named colors (predetermined swatches 
are a good idea) so that the service provider knows which color should 
be printed. In this case, you’re using spot colors, which are mixed inks 
that match the colors you specify in InDesign.
For more information on color models and inks, check out Book I, 
Chapter 7. This chapter explains how colors are determined in the different 
color modes.
Using Color Swatches and Libraries
The Swatches panel and swatch libraries help you choose colors. Swatch 
libraries help you use colors for specific publishing purposes. The colors 
you use in a document can vary greatly depending on what you’re creating 
the document for. For example, one publication you make with InDesign may 
be for a catalog that only has two colors; another may be for the Web, where 
you have many colors available to you.
The Swatches panel
You can create, apply, and edit colors with the Swatches panel. In addition 
to solid colors, this panel also allows you to create and edit tints and 
gradients and then apply them to objects on a page. Choose Window➪
Swatches to open or expand the Swatches panel.
To create a new color swatch to use in your document, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the arrow in the upper-right corner to open the Swatches panel 
menu; choose New Color Swatch.
 
 The New Color Swatch dialog box opens.
 
2. Type a new name for the color swatch or leave the color named by 
color values.
 
 (The colors in the Swatches panel appear this way as a default.)
 
 This name is displayed next to the color swatch when it’s entered into 
the panel.

Using Color Swatches and Libraries
184
 
3. Choose the color type from the Color Type drop-down list.
 
 Are you using a spot color (Pantone, for example) or CMYK (Cyan, 
Magenta, Yellow, Black)?
 
4. Choose the color mode.
 
 With the Color Mode drop-down list, select a color mode. For this 
example, we use CMYK. Many of the other choices that you see are 
prebuilt color libraries for various systems.
 
5. Create the color by using the color sliders.
 
 Note that if you start with Black, you have to adjust that slider to the left 
to see the other colors.
 
6. Click OK or Add.
 
 Click Add if you want to continue adding colors to your Swatches panel 
or click OK if this color is the only one you’re adding. The color(s) are 
added to the Swatches panel.
You can make changes to the swatch by selecting the swatch in the 
Swatches panel and then choosing Swatch Options from the panel menu.
Swatch libraries
Swatch libraries, also known as color libraries, are standardized sets of 
named colors that help you because they’re the most commonly and 
frequently used sets of color swatches. This means that you can avoid trying 
to mix your own colors, which can be a difficult or tedious process to get 
right. For example, InDesign includes a swatch library for Pantone spot 
colors and a different library for Pantone process colors. These libraries are 
very useful if you’re working with either color set. (See the earlier section, 
“Understanding Color Models,” where we explain the difference between 
spot and process colors.)
To choose a swatch from a swatch library, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose New Color Swatch from the Swatches panel menu.
 
 The New Color Swatch dialog box opens.
 
2. Choose the color type you want to work with from the Color Type 
drop-down list.
 
 Choose from Process or Spot Color types.
 
3. Select a color library from the Color Mode drop-down list.
 
 The drop-down list contains a list of color swatch libraries to choose 
from, such as Pantone Process Coated or TRUMATCH. After choosing a 
swatch set, the library opens and appears in the dialog box. For this

example, we chose the standard Pantone solid coated. If you’re looking 
for the standard numbered Pantone colors, this set is the easiest to 
choose from. The Pantone solid-coated library of swatches loads.
 
4. Pick a swatch from the library.
 
 Type a Pantone number, if you have one, in the Pantone text box. Most 
companies have set Pantone colors that they use for consistency. You 
can also scroll and click a swatch in the library’s list of colors, as shown 
in Figure 7-1.
 
 Picking Pantone colors this way is rarely accurate. Spending money 
on the PANTONE(r) COLOR BRIDGE® SET is a wise investment. Get 
more details about this guide at www.pantone.com and search for 
Color Bridge.
 
5. Click the Add button.
 
 This step adds the swatch to your list of color swatches in the Swatches 
panel. You can add as many color swatches as you like.
 
6. When you’re finished adding swatches, click the Done button.
 
 After you add a new color, the swatch is added to the list of swatches in 
the Swatches panel and is ready to use in your project. Look in the 
Swatches panel to see the newly added colors.

Printing Your Work
You can print your work from an InDesign document in many different ways, 
with many kinds of printers and processes. You can either use a printer at 
home or in your office, which are of varying levels of quality and design, or 
you can take your work into a professional establishment to print. Printing 
establishments (or service providers) also vary in the quality of production 
they can offer you.

Printing Your Work
186
The following subsections look at the different ways you can set up your 
document for printing and the kinds of issues you may encounter during this 
process.
What’s a bleed?
If you want an image or span of color to go right to the edge of a page, with-
out any margins, you need to bleed off the edge of the document. Bleeding 
extends the print area slightly beyond the edge of the page into the area that 
will be cut as usual during the printing process. When you print your work, 
you can turn on crop and bleed marks to show where the page needs to be 
trimmed and to make sure that the image bleeds properly. We cover this 
topic in the last section of this chapter, “Doing it yourself: Printing at home 
or in the office.”
About trapping
When you print documents, the printer is seldom absolutely perfect when 
creating a printed page with multiple inks. The registration (which deter-
mines the alignment of the separate colors when printed) will most surely be 
off. This discrepancy can potentially cause a gap between two colors on the 
page so that unprinted paper shows through between them. To solve this 
problem, use trapping. Trapping overlaps elements on the page slightly so 
that you don’t have that gap in between the elements. The basic principle of 
trapping is to spread the lighter of the colors into the other. See Figure 7-2 
for an example.
InDesign has built-in software for trapping. The settings you make are 
applied to the entire page. You choose settings in the Trap Presets panel. 
You can use the default settings, customize the trapping settings, or decide 
not to use trapping at all. To modify the default settings and then apply the 
customized settings, follow these steps:

1. Choose Window➪Output➪Trap Presets.
 
 The Trap Presets panel opens. The trapping presets in InDesign are 
document-wide, but you can assign individual trappings by using the 
Attributes panel (choose Window➪Attributes) to overprint strokes on 
selected art only.
 
2. Double-click [Default] in the panel’s list.
 
 The Modify Trap Preset Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 
7-3. The default settings are perfectly adequate for many printing jobs.
 
Figure 7-3: 
The Modify 
Trap Preset 
Options 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Change the trap preset options, if you know what’s necessary, and 
then click OK to close the dialog box.
 
 If you don’t know what to change, investigate the options for a better 
understanding of how they work. You can also get settings from your 
print provider.
 
4. In the Trap Presets panel, choose New Preset from the panel menu.
 
 The New Trap Preset dialog box opens.
 
5. Type an appropriate name for the new trap preset.
 
 You see this name in the list of trap presets in the Trap Presets panel 
when it’s opened. You might create a name for a printer that has 
different settings than another.
 
6. Review and make any changes to the new preset in the dialog box.
 
 You can change the presets in the following ways:
 
• Trap Width: The Default value specifies the width of the trap for any 
ink that you use in the document, except for black. The value for 
black is entered into the Black text field.

Printing Your Work
188
 
• Images: These settings control how InDesign handles trapping 
between elements on the document page and any imported graphics 
on it. Use the Trap Placement drop-down list to define how images 
trap to objects on the page. When you have bitmap images next to 
each other, select the Trap Images to Images check box.
 
• Trap Appearance: These settings allow you to do some fine-tuning 
and change how the corner points appear in trapping. You can 
select how you want the corner points to appear with the Join Style 
drop-down list; you can select how you want end points to appear 
(overlapped or separated) from the End Style drop-down list.
 
• Trap Thresholds: These settings allow you to control how InDesign 
traps the areas between two colors in your document. You can 
control whether InDesign traps two objects of similar colors (for 
example, how different do these colors have to be before InDesign 
starts trapping).
 
7. Click OK to create the trap preset.
 
 The New Trap Preset dialog box closes, and the customized preset is 
added to the panel.
To assign a trap preset to a number of pages (or all of them), click the arrow 
in the upper-right corner of the Trap Preset panel and choose Assign Trap 
Preset from the panel menu. The dialog box that opens allows you to choose 
a trapping style and assign it to all pages or a range of pages. Click the 
Assign button to assign the preset before clicking the Done button.
 
There are also other ways to apply trapping to your document manually. 
This process goes beyond the scope of this book but is worthwhile to look 
into if you want to fully realize what trapping is all about. See InDesign CS3 
Bible (written by Galen Gruman and published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.) for 
more information on trapping.
Taking your files to a service provider
If you’re taking your file to a professional print service (service provider), 
you may have to save the .indd document as a different format. Even though 
they should (in our opinion) have InDesign, not all service providers do.
Here are the two major groups of printers: PostScript and non-PostScript. 
PostScript printers take files written in the PostScript language and read the 
files to print them. PostScript files describe the contents of each page and 
how they should look when printed. Most printers you find in a home or 
office are not PostScript printers.

If you’re giving the file to someone to print, you can pass on your work in a 
few different ways. You can give the person printing the document your orig-
inal InDesign document. Of course, he (or the business) must have a copy of 
InDesign on hand to open the file. Or you can send a PostScript file or PDF 
file to print. Sometimes, you have to ask what the preferred file type for 
opening and printing the document is. You’re probably best off sending the 
original InDesign file (if you can) or a PDF. When you create a PDF, your 
documents should print accurately.
The Preflight feature is used to check for quality in your document, and tell 
you information about the document you’re printing (such as listing the 
fonts, print settings, and inks that you’re using). Using Preflight can help you 
determine whether your InDesign document has unlinked images or missing 
fonts before printing your document. Choose File➪Package to access the 
Preflight dialog box.
You can determine whether any elements associated with the file are 
missing and then package it into a single folder to take the document to a 
service provider. Here’s how:
 
1. Choose File➪Package
 
 The Preflight dialog box opens. The Summary screen is open to begin 
with, and it shows you all the current images and fonts found in 
the document. Essentially, the summary is based on an analysis of the 
document.
 
2. Click Fonts in the list on the left side of the dialog box.
 
 Any fonts in your document are listed in this screen. Select fonts on this 
list and click the Find Font button to discover where they’re located on 
your hard drive. These fonts are directly saved into the package folder 
when you’re finished.
 
3. Click Links and Images in the list on the left side of the dialog box.
 
 The Links and Images screen lists the images within your document. 
Find the image, update it, and repair links before packing the file. If any 
images aren’t properly linked, your document is incomplete and prints 
with pictures missing. Also, make sure that if you’re sending your work 
to a professional printer, you’ve properly converted your images to 
CMYK. For your desktop printer, RGB is fine.
 
4. When you’re finished, click the Package button at the bottom of the 
dialog box.
 
 Your document and all the associated files are saved into a folder. 
You’re given the opportunity to name the folder and specify a location 
on the hard drive.

Doing it yourself: Printing at home or in the office
You’ve probably printed other kinds of documents in the past, and perhaps 
you’ve even played with the printer settings. These settings depend on what 
kind of printer you’re using and what associated printer drivers you have 
installed on your system. Whatever operating system you work with and 
whatever printer you use, you have some settings that control the printer’s 
output. This section deals only with the more basic and common kinds of 
printing that you may perform at home or in the office.
Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box. Many printing options are 
available in the list on the left side of the Print dialog box. Click an item, and 
the dialog box changes to display the settings you can change for the 
selected item.
The options you’re most likely to use when printing InDesign documents are 
as follows:
 
✦ General: Allows you to set the number of copies of the document you 
want to print and the range of pages to print. You can select the Reverse 
Order check box to print from the last to first page. Select an option 
from the Sequence drop-down list to print only even or odd pages 
instead of all pages. If you’re working with spreads that need to be 
printed on a single page, select the Spreads check box.
 
✦ Setup: This screen is where you can define the paper size, orientation 
(portrait or landscape), and scale. You can scale a page so that it’s up to 
1,000 percent of its original size or as little as 1 percent. You can option-
ally constrain the scale of the width and height so that the page remains 
at the same ratio. The Page Position drop-down list is useful when you’re 
using paper that’s larger than the document you’ve created. This option 
helps you to center the document on the larger paper.
 
✦ Marks and Bleed: The settings on this screen allow you to turn on or off 
many of the printing marks in the document, such as crop, bleed, and 
registration marks. For example, you may want to show these marks if 
you have a bleed extending past the boundaries of the page and need to 
show where to crop each page. This screen also shows a preview of 
what the page looks like when printed. You can also select options to 
print page information (such as filename and date) on each page.
 
✦ Output: This area allows you to choose how you’ll print the pages — 
for example, as a separation or composite, with which inks (if you’re 
using separations), with or without trapping, and so forth. InDesign 
can separate and print your documents as plates (which are used in 
commercial printing) from settings you specify here.

Book II
Chapter 7
Understanding 
Color and Printing
Printing Your Work
191
 
✦ Graphics: This screen controls how graphics and fonts in the document 
are printed. The Send Data drop-down list controls bitmap images and 
how much of the data from these images is sent to the printer. The All 
option sends all bitmap data, the Optimized Subsampling option sends 
as much image data as the printer can handle, the Proxy option prints 
lower-quality images mostly to preview them, and the None option 
prints placeholder boxes with an X through them.
 
✦ Color Management: In this area, you choose how you want color 
handled upon output. If you have profiles loaded in your system for your 
output devices, you can select them here.
 
✦ Advanced: Use this area to determine how you want images to be sent 
to the printer. If you don’t have a clue about Open Prepress Interface 
(OPI), you can leave this setting at the default. Also known as image-
swapping technology, OPI is the process that allows low-resolution 
images inserted into InDesign to be swapped with the high-resolution 
version for output.
 
 Flattening needs to be addressed if you used a drop shadow, feathered 
an object in InDesign, or applied transparency to any of your objects, 
even if they were created in Photoshop or Illustrator.
 
 Use the preset Medium Resolution for desktop printers and High 
Resolution for professional press output.
 
✦ Summary: This window doesn’t allow for modifications but provides 
you a good overview of all your print settings.
 
After you make your settings, click the Save Preset button if you want to 
save the changes you’ve made. If you think you may print other documents 
with these settings repeatedly, using the Save Preset feature can be a great 
timesaver.
After you click the Save Preset button, the Save Preset dialog box opens, 
where you can enter a new name to save the settings as. The next time you 
print a document, you can select the saved preset from the Print Preset 
drop-down list in the Print dialog box.
Click the Print button at the bottom of the Print dialog box when you’re 
ready to print the document.

Chapter 8: Exporting Your Work
In This Chapter
✓ Looking at file formats
✓ Exporting to different file formats
You can export publications into several different kinds of file formats 
from InDesign, just as you can import various kinds of file formats. In 
this chapter, we take a closer look at the different kinds of files you can 
create electronically from an InDesign document.
Understanding File Formats
What kind of file format you decide to export to depends on what you’ll use 
the file for. The first thing you want to do is figure out what you need your 
content to do. Does the content need to be on a Web page, or do you need 
to send the file by e-mail? Do you need to import the content into a different 
program, such as Macromedia Flash or Adobe Illustrator? Do you need to 
take a particular kind of file somewhere else to print it?
Exporting your files to a particular format is how you can take your content 
from InDesign and make it “portable” for integration or display purposes. 
You can choose from a range of formats, and you can control many settings 
to customize how the file is exported.
You can export a file in several different file formats from InDesign. You can 
export to image files in the following formats:
 
✦ JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): A commonly used method 
of compression for photographic images.
 
✦ EPS (Encapsulated PostScript): A self-contained PostScript document, 
which describes an image or drawing that can be placed within another 
PostScript document.
 
✦ XML (Extensible Markup Language): A general-purpose specification 
for creating custom markup languages, used in InDesign to export 
InCopy files.

Understanding File Formats
194
 
✦ SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): An XML specification and file format 
for describing two-dimensional vector graphics, both static and 
animated.
 
✦ PDF (Portable Document Format): Used for document exchange, see 
more in next section.
 
✦ Rich or Plain text (text files): Rich formatting can include formatting, 
whereas plain includes text only.
Different file formats are used for different purposes. Here are some of the 
things you can do with files exported from InDesign:
 
✦ Image files: Image files, such as JPEG and EPS, can be exported from 
InDesign and then imported into other software programs. You can 
export these images for use in print after being imported into a different 
graphics program or you can use the images on the Web. It all depends 
on how you set up the document for export and the settings you use.
 
✦ PDFs: PDF (Portable Document Format) is a common format used exten-
sively for distributing files, such as e-books, brochures, and so on. You 
may need to distribute the file to a wide audience or to a service pro-
vider for printing. Anyone who’s installed the Adobe Reader (also known 
as Acrobat Reader) on his or her computer can view your document. 
PDF is also used for importing as an image or text into other programs, 
such as Flash.
 
✦ InCopy stories: InCopy is tightly integrated with InDesign and is used 
to create and edit text documents. Therefore, if you have InCopy, you 
can export to it when you want to extensively edit the text in your file. 
InCopy is used for word processing and is designed to integrate with 
InDesign for associated page layout. You can read more about this 
application at www.adobe.com/products/incopy.
 
✦ SVG files: You can export as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), which 
is a file format that combines XML and CSS to display your files. SVG 
is a vector-based format that’s also used for displaying content online 
through use of an oversized plug-in called SVG Viewer. You can down-
load it for Mac or Windows platforms from http://www.adobe.com/
svg/viewer/install/main.html.
 
✦ Text files: Text files are a simple way to export your content. If you need 
the text from your document only to incorporate or send elsewhere, you 
can export as plain (Text Only), tagged, or rich text. If you need to send 
your document to someone who doesn’t have InDesign, exporting as 
text may be a good option.
After determining which file format you want to export your file as, take a 
look at how to export these files and the different kinds of settings you can 
control when doing so. The rest of this chapter shows you how to export 
different file types from InDesign.

Exporting Publications
You can export publications from the Export dialog box. Access the Export 
dialog box by choosing File➪Export. From this main Export dialog box, you 
can choose the file format, a name for the file, and a location to save the file 
in. After specifying a name, a location, and a format to export to for the new 
file, click Save and a new dialog box opens where you can make settings 
specific to the file format you picked. We discuss some of the most common 
file formats that you’re likely to use for export in the following sections.
Exporting PDF documents
InDesign allows you to export a PDF file of your document or book. If you 
choose to export a PDF document, you have many options available to 
customize the document you’re exporting. You can control the amount of 
compression for the document, the marks and bleeds you have in InDesign, 
and security settings. Here’s how you export to PDF:
 
1. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box opens.
 
2. Choose a location in which to save the files and enter a new filename.
 
 Browse to a location on your hard drive with the Save In drop-down list 
if you’re using Windows and name the file in the File Name text field. 
Name the file in the Save As text field on the Mac and choose a location 
with the Where drop-down list.
 
3. Select Adobe PDF from the Save as Type (Windows) or Format (Mac) 
drop-down list.
 
4. Click Save.
 
 The Export PDF dialog box appears with the General options screen 
open.
 
5. Choose a preset from the Preset drop-down list.
 
 These presets are very good and easy to use. If you’re familiar with 
Adobe Acrobat and the Adobe Distiller functions, they’re the same. (For 
more detailed information about what each setting does, see Book V.)
 
 These presets automatically change the export settings for your docu-
ment. For example, you can select Smallest File Size from the Preset 
drop-down list if you’re displaying your work online or select High 
Quality Print if you plan for the PDF to be printed on home printers. 
Select Press Quality if you intend to have the PDF professionally printed.
 
6. Leave the Standard drop-down list at None.
 
 Unless, of course, you know about PDF/X and know which form of it to 
select. The details of PDF/X are explained in Book V.

Exporting Publications
196
 
7. Select a range of pages to export by typing the start (then a hyphen) 
and end page in the Range text box.
 
 You can also print non-consecutive pages by separating the page 
numbers with a comma.
 
 You can choose to export all pages or a range of pages.
 
8. Choose a compatibility setting for the PDF from the Compatibility 
drop-down list.
 
 Compatibility settings determine what kind of reader is required to 
view the document. Setting compatibility to Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4) ensures 
a wide audience can view your PDF. Some older PDF readers may not 
be able to interpret certain features in your document if you choose 
compatibility for a higher version.
 
9. Choose whether to embed thumbnails, whether to optimize the docu-
ment, and what kinds of elements to include in the file by checking 
the check box to the left of the options in the Include section.
 
 Other settings allow you to include bookmarks, links, and other ele-
ments in the file. Unless you’ve added any of these elements, you don’t 
need to worry about selecting these options. You may want to embed 
thumbnail previews, but an Acrobat user can create thumbnails when 
the file is open as well.
 
 Click Security in the list on the left of the Export PDF dialog box to open 
the Security screen, where you can specify passwords to open the 
document. You can also choose a password that’s required to print or 
modify the PDF file.
 
10. Click the Export button to export the file.
 
 The file is saved to the location you specified in Step 2.
Exporting EPS files
From InDesign, you can export EPS files, which are useful for importing into 
other programs. EPS files are single-page graphics files, which means each 
exported InDesign page is saved as a separate EPS file. Here’s how to export 
EPS files:
 
1. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box opens.
 
2. Select a location on your hard drive to save the EPS files, enter a new 
filename, and select EPS from the Save as Type (Windows) or Format 
(Mac) drop-down list; click Save.
 
 The Export EPS dialog box opens.

Book II
Chapter 8
Exporting 
Your Work
Exporting Publications
197
 
3. Choose a page or range of pages to export.
 
 Select the All Pages option to export all pages or select the Ranges 
option and enter a range of pages. If you want spreads to export as one 
file, select the Spreads check box.
 
 If you’re creating more than one EPS file (for example, exporting more 
than one page of your InDesign document), the file is saved with the 
filename, an underscore, and then the page number. For example, page 7 
of a cats.indd file would be saved as cats_7.eps in the designated 
location.
 
 No need to export an EPS to place an InDesign file into another InDesign 
file! If you’re creating classified pages or any page that contains other 
InDesign pages, you can save yourself a few steps by simply choosing 
File➪Place and selecting the InDesign file.
 
4. From the Color drop-down list, select a color mode; from the Embed 
Fonts drop-down list, select how you want fonts to be embedded.
 
 From the Color drop-down list, select Leave Unchanged to retain the 
color mode you’re using for the InDesign document. You can also 
change the color mode to CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), Gray 
(grayscale), or RGB (Red, Green, Blue). For more information on color 
modes, flip to Chapter 7 of this minibook.
 
 From the Embed Fonts drop-down list, select Subset to embed only the 
characters that are used in the file. If you select Complete, all the fonts 
in the file are loaded when you print the file. Selecting None means that 
a reference to where the font is located is written into the file.
 
5. Choose whether you want a preview to be generated for the file by 
choosing from the Preview drop-down list.
 
 A preview (a small thumbnail image) is useful if an EPS file can’t be 
displayed. For example, if you’re browsing through a library of images, 
you’ll see a small thumbnail image of the EPS file; so whether or not 
you use the image or can open it on your computer, you can see what 
the file looks like. From the Preview drop-down list, you can select 
TIFF to generate a preview; select None if you don’t want a preview to 
be created.
 
6. Click the Export button to export the files.
 
 The files are saved to the location you designated in Step 2.
Exporting JPEG files
You can export JPEG files from an InDesign document. You can export a 
single object on the selected page, or you can export entire pages and 
spreads as a JPEG image. JPEG files allow you to effectively compress full 
color or black-and-white images.

Exporting Publications
198
To export a JPEG image, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an object on a page or make sure that no object is selected if 
you want to export a page or spread.
 
2. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box opens.
 
3. Type a filename, locate where you want to save the file on your hard 
drive, and select JPEG from the Save as Type (Windows) or Format 
(Mac) drop-down list; click Save.
 
 The Export JPEG dialog box opens.
 
4. If you want to export a page, select the Page option and enter the page 
number; if you want to export the currently selected object, make sure 
that the Selection option is selected.
 
 The Selection option is available only if a selection was made in Step 1.
 
5. Choose an image quality and format to export by choosing from the 
Image Quality and the Format Method drop-down lists.
 
 The Image Quality drop-down list controls the amount of compression 
used when you export the JPEG. The Maximum option creates an image 
with the highest file size and best quality, whereas the Low option 
creates a smaller file of lesser quality because it includes less image 
information.
 
 If you choose the Baseline format from the Format Method drop-down 
list, the entire image has to be downloaded before it displays in a Web 
browser. Select Progressive to show the image in a progressively 
complete display as it downloads in a Web browser.
 
6. Click the Export button.
 
 The file exports and saves to the location that you specified in Step 3.
Exporting the Flash CS4 XFL format
In InDesign CS4, you can export your InDesign document as a Flash SWF 
(Shockwave Flash file). To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box appears.
 
2. Choose a location to save the files, enter a new filename, and choose 
Adobe Flash (SWF) from the Save as Type (Windows) or Format (Mac) 
drop-down list.

Book II
Chapter 8
Exporting 
Your Work
Exporting Publications
199
 
 If you need to include video, audio, animation, and complex interactiv-
ity, export your file as Adobe Flash CS4 XFL (a .zip file that contains 
the source material for a Flash document) because this file format 
supports those features.
 
 The Export SWF dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-1, allows you to set the 
output size, specify the pages to include, and make various conversion 
and compression choices.
 
3. Choose the size you want for the exported file.
 
 Select the Scale option and leave the drop-down list at 100% if you don’t 
want to change the size of the exported file. Otherwise, select the Fit To 
option and choose from the drop-down list, or select the Width option 
and enter your own dimensions in the Width and Height drop-down lists.
 
4. Select which page(s) you want to export.
 
 Select the All option to export the entire document; select Range and 
enter a page number if you want to export only a specific page or pages. 
Select the Spreads check box if you want to export page spreads.
 
5. Select how you want the text to export from the Text drop-down list.
 
 What’s really great about exporting as Adobe Flash CS4 (XFL) is that 
your InDesign objects remain vector (unless transparency is applied), 
and you have the option to export InDesign text as editable Flash text, 
vectors, or pixels.
 
 If you choose InDesign Text to Flash Text, please note that the text is 
laid out in Flash with each line becoming a separate text object.

6. Select the Interactivity options you want by choosing one or more 
check boxes.
 
 You can choose to include buttons, hyperlinks, page transitions, and 
interactive page curls by selecting the appropriate check boxes.
 
7. Choose the image compression, JPEG quality, and curve quality you 
want from the Image Compression, JPEG Quality, and Curve Quality 
drop-down lists.
 
8. Click OK to export your InDesign document as a Flash file.
Exporting text files
You can export plain or rich text from an InDesign document or as an 
InDesign tagged text format. These formats can be slightly different, 
depending on the text in your document.
To export text, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Text tool from the toolbox and select some text within a text 
frame in your document.
 
 You must have text selected in order to see text export options in the 
Export dialog box.
 
2. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box opens.
 
3. Enter a filename, select a location to save the file in, and select Text 
Only from the Save as Type (Windows) or Format (Mac) drop-down 
list; click Save.
 
 The Text Export Options dialog box opens.
 
4. Choose a platform and encoding for the export.
 
 Select either Windows or Macintosh from the Platform drop-down list to 
set the PC or Mac operating system compatibility. Select an encoding 
method for the platform you choose from the Encoding drop-down list; 
you can choose either Default Platform or Unicode.
 
 Unicode is a universal character-encoding standard that’s compatible 
with major operating systems. Encoding refers to how characters are 
represented in a digital format, and it’s essentially a set of rules that 
determines how the character set is represented by associating each 
character with a particular code sequence.
 
5. Click the Export button.
 
 The file exports and saves to the location that you specified in Step 3.

Chapter 9: Integrating InDesign
In This Chapter
✓ Integrating Version Cue
✓ Exporting to Acrobat
✓ Working with Photoshop files
✓ Using Illustrator files in InDesign
✓ Using InDesign with Dreamweaver
T
he Adobe Creative Suite and InDesign offer you a multitude of options 
to integrate all the Creative Suite 4 applications. (When you integrate 
products, you work on a single project using more than one piece of 
software.)
When software products are built as a suite, it typically is an advantage to 
the user. Software designers create ways that the user can integrate the 
products to work together and give the user more power to maintain a 
workflow, check errors, and help with consistency in a project. By making 
the Adobe Creative Suite 4 products work together, you can get some 
incredible results!
Using InDesign with Version Cue
With Adobe Version Cue, you can keep a project organized and accessible 
from all the Creative Suite applications. Many users don’t jump right in 
because they’ve never experienced the convenience project management 
software provides, but we guarantee that you’ll love it.
Adobe Version Cue manages files you author in the following Adobe 
Creative Suite components: Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, 
Flash, and Acrobat 9. In Version Cue, you create projects, either new, blank 
projects that you save into, or new projects from existing work.
You and other users can then access the projects through the Creative Suite 
applications. Version Cue manages files stored in projects, which keep all 
the files related to an assignment together in one place. Version Cue can 
even keep track of non-Adobe files, such as spreadsheets and invoices. 
Because Version Cue works in each Creative Suite component, your design 
process isn’t interrupted when you work on each file in a project.

Using InDesign with Version Cue
202
You can use Version Cue to track changes to files while you work on them. 
You can even keep several versions of each file for future reference. By using 
Version Cue, multiple users can access files in a project, work on them, and 
lock out anyone else who may want to work on the file at the same time. 
Benefit to this one: No changes are overwritten accidentally by another 
person on your team!
The following list is a quick look at what you can do with Version Cue:
 
✦ Create a new project and organize all your files into that single project.
 
✦ Make your projects secure, private, or shared.
 
✦ Create and manage different versions of a file.
 
✦ Insert comments that you can refer to later.
 
✦ Browse projects with comments, thumbnails, and information on each 
file contained within the project.
 
✦ Back up projects.
 
✦ Set and remove permissions on the project files (if you’re working with 
the more advanced features of Version Cue).
 
✦ Add users to a project, who can work on and edit files.
 
✦ Share projects among several users.
You must have the Version Cue CS4 server installed before you can use 
these features.
Setting up the Version Cue server
Version Cue involves several processes, one of which is installing Adobe 
Drive on to the machine that is designated as the server. If you do not plan 
to use Version Cue, it’s recommended that you don’t go through the steps in 
this section.
 
You may not want the Version Cue server on your computer. If that’s the 
case, you can install it on another computer that can act as your server.
Follow these steps to start the Version Cue Server:
 
1. Open the Control Panel (Windows) or choose Apple➪System 
Preferences➪Other➪Version Cue CS4 (Mac).
 
2. Double-click Adobe Version Cue CS4 to launch the Version Cue utility.
 
 Note that in Windows, you can find Version Cue in the Classic View of 
the Control Panel.
 
 The Adobe Version Cue CS4 Server dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 9-1.

 Now you can define the Administrator Password — system is the default 
administrator login. You will use this to initially login to Version Cue 
Server. You can create additional users with administrator privileges in 
the users/groups.
 
6. Type in a new password for the system administrator login in the 
Password and Verify Password text boxes.
 
 Remember the password, because there’s no way to recover it if you 
forget or lose it!
 
7. Type in a server name in the Define Server Name text box and verify 
the number of users you want to see the server.
 
8. Click the Save & Continue button in the upper-left section of the 
Administration window.
 
 You’re presented the opportunity to log in with the system login and 
your newly-defined password.
 
9. Type system in the Login text box and your password in the Password 
text box, and then click Log In.
 
 After logging in, the Getting Started window appears, presenting you the 
options to manage users or create a project.
Setting up a project file
To set up a project file, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Create a Project.
 
2. Select Blank Project.
 
 The Properties window appears where you can create a name (perhaps 
test project), and enter it in the Project Name text box.
 
3. Select the Share This Project with Others check box.
 
4. Click the Create button.
 
5. When the New Project window appears, click OK.
 
 A new project is created.
 
If you want more help with setting up a project using Version Cue, launch 
the Adobe Bridge application, which resides in the same folder as your other 
Adobe Creative Suite applications. Click Version Cue in the left column and 
choose Help➪Version Cue Help.
Adding a user to the project
To add a user to the project, simply follow these steps:

Saving a file into a project
Version Cue essentially establishes a separate drive that you can access 
through your Save and Open dialog boxes. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As.
 
2. In the Save As window, choose Computer or locate the drive named 
Network Drive, and double-click to open the drive.
 
 Your project is listed by name in the drive directory system.
 
 This drive may be referred to as the Adobe Drive.
 
3. Open the test project folder that you created, and click Save.
 
 Note that this drive is accessible from all of the Creative Suite 4 applica-
tions, so you can save components such as illustrations, movies, and 
images directly into individual project folders.
This is just a start. After you save into a project, you can save various 
versions, set up other users to share that file (remember that they’re locked 
out if you’re using it), and help keep your entire projects organized . . . 
what fun!

Integrating InDesign with Acrobat
You can import, export, and create documents for creating PDF files with 
InDesign. You can further manipulate these files with Adobe Acrobat, or you 
can build in certain features with InDesign. In Chapter 8 of this minibook, 
you discover more about exporting PDF files from InDesign. In this chapter, 
we look at some of the other ways that you can control PDF attributes right 
in InDesign.
Using InDesign is one of the best ways to design and create PDF documents. 
With InDesign, you can add features and interactivity to a PDF in the 
following ways:
 
✦ Add clickable elements, such as hyperlinks and bookmarks.
 
✦ Add buttons that perform actions.
 
✦ Set up page transitions.
 
✦ Add movies (such as Flash SWF files or QuickTime movies) and 
sound files.
Creating a hyperlink
You can add hyperlinks to link to another piece of text, a page, or a URL 
(a Web site address). To create a URL hyperlink in a PDF with InDesign, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open a new document that includes some text in a text frame.
 
 Choose a document that you want to add a hyperlink to.
 
2. Choose Window➪Interactive➪Hyperlinks to open the Hyperlinks 
panel.
 
 The Hyperlinks panel opens. Notice that the panel’s menu contains 
several options, and you can use buttons along the bottom of the panel 
to add new hyperlinks or delete links from the panel.
 
3. Use the Text tool to select some text.
 
 Select the text that you want to make into a hyperlink.
 
4. Click the Create New Hyperlink button at the bottom of the 
Hyperlinks panel.
 
 The New Hyperlink dialog box opens. Make sure that URL is selected in 
the Type drop-down list.
 
5. Type a URL in the URL text field, if necessary.
 
 The type you enter is the Web page the URL links to. Make sure that it’s 
a complete URL, such as http://www.yourdomain.com. This field 
also accepts mailto: actions if you want to create an e-mail link. Simply 
enter an e-mail address, such as mailto:you@yourdomain.com, in the 
URL text field.

6. Choose an appearance for the clickable text.
 
 Under the Appearance section, you can choose to have a visible or invis-
ible rectangle (whether you want a rectangle to appear around the link). 
Then you can choose the highlight, color, width, and style of your link.
 
7. Click OK when you’re finished.
 
 The dialog box closes. When you export your document as a PDF, this 
text becomes a clickable hyperlink. Clicking the text opens a browser 
window to the Web page you entered in the URL text field. Make sure 
that the Hyperlinks check box is selected in the Export PDF dialog box 
when you create the PDF file.
 
You can also create a hyperlink by selecting a URL that exists in your text 
frame. To do so, select the URL and right-click (Windows) or Control-click 
(Mac) the selected text. Choose Interactive➪New Hyperlink Destination, and 
the dialog box opens where you can edit the link. Click OK, and a hyperlink 
is created.
Adding a media file
In this section, we show you how to add some basic interactivity to a PDF 
file using InDesign by adding a movie file. You can add a SWF file or a MOV 
file, depending on what you have available. These media files won’t play 
while you’re using InDesign. However, the files will play if you export the 
document to PDF or XML. To view a movie in a PDF file, double-click 
the movie.
 
You can add the following movie files to a PDF: SWF, MOV, AVI, and MPEG. 
You can add these audio files: AIF, AU, and WAV.
To add a media file to a PDF document using InDesign, follow these steps 
(remember that you need at least Acrobat Reader 6 to view the PDF and play 
the media file):
 
1. Choose File➪Place.
 
 The Place dialog box opens, where you can choose a media file to 
import. Choose an SWF, MOV, AVI, or MPEG to import.
 
 You can import only SWF files created for the Flash 5 Player and earlier. 
You can’t import files into InDesign created for Flash Player 6 or 
Flash Player 7.
 
2. Click within the document window to place the media file on the page.
 
 The Place cursor appears after you select a file to import into the 
document. Click where you want the upper-left corner to be situated on 
the page.

Integrating InDesign with Acrobat
208
 
3. Export the PDF file by choosing File➪Export and choosing Adobe PDF 
from the Save as Type (Windows) or the Format (Mac) drop-down list 
and then click Save.
 
 The Export PDF dialog box appears.
 
4. Choose Acrobat 6 or higher from the Compatibility drop-down list and 
then make sure that the Interactive Elements check box is selected.
 
5. In the Multimedia drop-down list, choose the Embed option to include 
the movie in the PDF, the Link option to create a link to the movie file 
in the PDF, or the Use Object Settings option to use the settings 
already made in InDesign.
 
 The Embed option increases the file size. If you choose the Link option, 
you must have the file accessible to the PDF when you send it to 
someone or put it online.
 
 If you play the file in Acrobat Reader 6 or greater, the video plays when 
you double-click the frame.
Exporting to Flash
New in InDesign CS4, you can export to the Flash XFL format. The possibili-
ties for this feature are great. Just think, you can now export a multiple-page 
document as a Flash document. What is even more exciting is that page 
transitions can be set right in InDesign CS4. This feature allows you to 
choose all the over-the-top transitions that you could want, from box and 
comb transitions to zoom in and out.
To select a page transition, choose Window➪Interactive➪Page Transitions. 
When the Page Transitions panel appears, use the drop-down list to select 
from a variety of page transitions.
When you export the file to the Flash XFL format and open your XFL file in a 
browser, you can grab a corner of a page, as shown in Figure 9-4, and turn it 
to see your page transitions at work.

Integrating InDesign with Photoshop
Many people create their designs in Photoshop (which we discuss thor-
oughly in Book IV) and then import the native PSD files from Photoshop CS4 
or greater right into InDesign. InDesign supports many of the features you 
can find in Photoshop, so you can have additional control over the designs 
after the image is imported into InDesign.
You’ll be thrilled with this great feature: InDesign CS4 lets you import a 
layered Photoshop file, turn on and off the layers, or even choose a layer 
comp to be placed. Follow these steps:
 
1. Have a layered Photoshop file ready to place.
 
2. In InDesign, choose File➪Place.
 
3. Browse to the location of your layered image file, select the file you 
want to import, and then select the Show Import Options check box.
 
 A dialog box similar to the one you see in Figure 9-5 appears.
 
4. Click the Layers tab and turn off and on the visibility of the layers you 
want to change or select a saved layer comp from the Layer Comp 
drop-down list.
 
5. Click OK to close the Image Import Options dialog box.
 
Figure 9-5: 
InDesign 
CS4 allows 
you to 
choose 
which 
layers you 
want to 
place.
 
Transparency support and clipping paths
Many Photoshop files use transparency. The transparency in the PSD files is 
imported and interpreted by InDesign. This feature is particularly useful 
when you have an established background or want to have an interesting 

Integrating InDesign with Illustrator
210
text wrap around an image that you import from Photoshop. Basically, you 
can use the transparency as a clipping path in InDesign. Clipping paths are 
like hard-edged masks that hide parts of an image, such as a background 
that you don’t want visible around a certain part of the image. (See Book IV, 
Chapter 5 for more about Photoshop clipping paths.)
You can use alpha channels, paths, and masks that you create in Photoshop 
in InDesign. InDesign recognizes these parts of the PSD, so you can use them 
when you’re wrapping text around the image or when you want to create a 
clipping path. Alternatively, you can also use these parts to remove a back-
ground from the image. For example, if you have an image with one of these 
assets, you can use the Detect Edges feature in InDesign to detect the edges 
and wrap text around the image. (We explain text wrapping in Chapter 4 of 
this minibook.)
Photoshop spot colors in InDesign
If you’re using spot colors in an image you import from Photoshop, those 
colors show up in the Swatches panel in InDesign. There is a chance that a 
color from your spot colors channel won’t be recognized. If that’s the case, 
the color is shown as gray instead. You can find more information on spot 
and process colors in Chapter 7 of this minibook.
You can use the swatches imported with the Photoshop file with other parts 
of your file. Simply use the swatches as you would any other swatch in 
InDesign. You can’t delete these swatches unless you remove the Photoshop 
file that you imported into InDesign. For more information about using the 
Swatches panel in InDesign, see Chapter 7 of this minibook.
Integrating InDesign with Illustrator
Illustrator (which we discuss at great length in Book III) is a tremendous 
drawing program that enables you to create complex drawings. Therefore, 
it’s a great tool to use for creating illustrations bound for InDesign page 
layouts. Luckily, you have several ways to control your Illustrator artwork 
directly in InDesign. You can import Illustrator 5.5 files and greater into 
InDesign and maintain the editability of the objects from the AI (Illustrator) 
file within InDesign, which means that you can edit the objects further after 
they’re imported. Also, any transparency in the AI file is preserved when you 
import it, meaning that you can wrap text around the drawings you create.
 
You can also copy and paste graphics from Illustrator to InDesign and then 
edit them directly in InDesign.

Integrating InDesign with InCopy
211
Integrating InDesign with InCopy
Adobe InCopy is text-editing software that enables writers to write and edit 
documents while layout is prepared separately. InCopy is similar to 
Microsoft Word in that you can make notes and comments, track changes, 
and use other similar editing features.
You may not have InCopy installed (it isn’t part of the Adobe Creative Suite), 
but you can integrate this Adobe software with InDesign in several important 
ways that you shouldn’t overlook. If you’re extensively editing stories, you 
may want to consider using InCopy for writing the text and importing and 
editing it further with InDesign.
Using InCopy with InDesign enables you to use a particular workflow 
because you can tell whether a file needs to be updated, or if it’s currently 
being edited, by a series of icons that appear on the page in InDesign. The 
following sections show some of the ways that you can directly manipulate 
InCopy stories with InDesign.
Importing InCopy stories
Follow these steps to import stories from InCopy:
 
1. In InCopy, create and save a text file.
 
 If you don’t have a copy of InCopy, you can download a 30-day trial 
version from www.adobe.com.
 
2. Return to InDesign, create a text frame, and keep it selected.
 
3. Choose File➪Place.
 
4. Browse to locate your InCopy file.
 
 (InCopy files end with the file extension .incx.)
 
 The InCopy story is placed into the text frame and in the Links panel, 
just like a graphic.
Updating InCopy stories
When a file is out of date, you need to update that story so that the most 
recent revisions are available to you for editing.
When you see the warning icon in the Links panel, follow these steps to 
update the InCopy story in InDesign:

Integrating InDesign with Dreamweaver
212
 
1. Choose the story listed in the Links panel.
 
2. Click the Update Link button in the bottom of the Links panel.
 
 The story updates, and the warning icon disappears. You can now work 
with the up-to-date version of the story in InDesign.
Integrating InDesign with Dreamweaver
Exporting an InDesign document for Dreamweaver allows you to take 
InDesign documents (or even complete books) and package them for further 
editing in Dreamweaver CS4. This feature enables you to put InDesign 
documents on the Web and make them available to a wide audience.
To export a document for Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. With an InDesign document open, choose File➪Export for 
Dreamweaver.
 
 The Save As window appears.
 
2. Find a location on your hard drive for the package and enter a name 
for your html file in the Save As text field.
 
3. Click the Save button.
 
 The XHTML Export Options dialog box appears. In this dialog box, you 
can determine whether you’re exporting only the selection (if you had 
something selected) or the entire document. You can also map how you 
want the bullets handled.
 
4. Select Images in the left column to see options for saving optimized 
images.
 
5. Leave the Image Conversion drop-down list set to Automatic to let 
InDesign decide whether an image is best saved as a GIF or JPEG, or 
determine which format you’d prefer all images to be saved in.
 
6. Click the Advanced button to determine how Cascading Style Sheets 
(CSS) are handled, whether you want them, or whether you want them 
to reference an external CSS style that it will link to.
 
7. After you complete the options, click the Export button.
 
 You can now open and edit the file in Dreamweaver.

Chapter 1: What’s New 
in Illustrator CS4
In This Chapter
✓ Working with multiple artboards
✓ Blobbing with the new Blob Brush tool
✓ Working with the Appearance panel
Yes, Adobe has done it again — the developers have created an even 
better Adobe Illustrator, and you can discover the best new features 
in this chapter. This chapter breezes through the new features to open 
your eyes to exciting new work methods. Don’t forget to look for references 
to where you can get more in-depth knowledge in other locations in this 
minibook.
Finally! Multiple Artboards
For those of you who wished that you could produce multiple page docu-
ments in Illustrator, your wish has come true. Something should be said 
about the new multiple artboard feature because Illustrator isn’t really the 
creation tool that you want to use to make multiple page documents, such 
as catalogs and books, but it’s handy to be able to add artboards to spec 
sheets and technical drawings.
In the past, adding pages was done using a rather convoluted method 
of making a large artboard and then tiling the pages. Now you can create 
multiple artboards (up to 100!) as soon as the New Document dialog 
box appears.
Creating a document with multiple artboards
To create a document with multiple artboards, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Adobe Illustrator CS4 and choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-1.

Finally! Multiple Artboards
216
 
2. Choose how many artboards you want to start with by entering a 
number in the Number of Artboards text box.
 
3. Click a grid icon to the right of the Number of Artboards text box to 
determine how you want the artboards laid out.
 
 With these grid boxes, you can set how many rows and columns you 
wish to use and you can also change the direction of the layout from left 
to right or right to left.
 
4. Enter an amount in the Spacing text box to determine how far apart 
the artboards will be.
 
 Enter 0 (zero) if you want the artboards butting against each other or a 
higher value if you want some space between them.
 
5. Click OK to create your new document.
 
Don’t worry if you need to edit the artboards at a later time. You can edit 
them by choosing File➪Document Setup and then clicking the Edit 
Artboards button in the upper-right corner in the Document Setup dialog 
box. You can also click the Document Setup button on the Control panel to 
get to this same dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Printing a document with multiple artboards
Pay close attention before you print a document with multiple artboards, or 
you may print needless pages. Here’s how you can control the artboards 
that print:
 
1. Choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-3.
 
2. Below the Preview box in the lower-left corner, click the arrows to 
preview the artboards.
 
3. After you determine which artboards you want to print, enter them 
into the Range text box.
 
 If you want to print all the artboards, make sure the All radio button is 
selected; otherwise enter a consecutive range, such as 1–3 in the Range 
text box. You can also print non-consecutive pages by separating them 
with a comma — enter 1, 5, 7 to print only artboards 1, 5 and 7.
 
4. Click the Print button to print your selected artboards.

Fun with the New Blob Brush Tool
A brush tool has been in Adobe Illustrator for quite some time, but now you 
can have the brush control that you have in other applications, such as 
Photoshop, right in Illustrator.
The Blob Brush is a new tool that’s available, as shown in Figure 1-4. When 
you use this tool, notice that it has a radial annotator that shows the size 
and shape of the current brush. So what’s so great about that? Press the 
right bracket (]) and watch the stroke width of the brush automatically 
increase; press the left bracket ([) to decrease the width of the stroke.

This new brush tool makes drawing with the brush much more intuitive . . . 
no more searching for your stroke controls!
Improving Appearances with the Appearance Panel
It’s always good to improve your appearance, and Illustrator has done just 
that with the Appearance panel. The Appearance panel is a huge resource 
for beginner users as well as power users because it keeps you informed of 
the attributes that are applied to a selected object.
Notice in Figure 1-5 that you can now choose fills and strokes easily, right in 
the Appearance panel. You can even duplicate fills and strokes in the 
Appearance panel, which gives you the ability to create all sorts of interest-
ing combinations. Read more about the Appearance panel in Chapter 12 of 
this minibook.
Note that when you have multiple strokes applied to one object, a warning 
appears in the Control panel notifying you if the topmost stroke isn’t 
selected. This saves you the trouble of applying a new stroke to the wrong 
stroke.
If you read through the following chapters in this minibook, you discover 
lots of other incredible additions to Adobe Illustrator CS4. Many of the 
improvements increase the speed of production and quality of output. Have 
fun and read on!

A
dobe Illustrator goes hand in hand with the other Adobe products but 
serves its own unique purpose. Although Adobe Illustrator can create 
multiple-page artwork (with artboards), it’s not meant to create lengthy 
documents with repeated headers, footers, and page numbers. Those types 
of files are more appropriate for applications like InDesign. Typically, you 
wouldn’t create artwork from Illustrator that’s made from pixels, such 
as images edited or created in Photoshop. Illustrator is generally used to 
create vector logos, illustrations, maps, packages, labels, signage, Web art, 
and more. (See the sidebar, “Vector graphics,” for more information.)
Vector graphics
Vector graphics are made up of lines and curves 
defined by mathematical objects called vectors. 
Because the paths (the lines and curves) are 
defined mathematically, you can move, resize, 
or change the color of vector objects without 
losing quality in the graphic.
Vector graphics are resolution-independent; 
that is, they can be scaled to any size and 
printed at any resolution without losing detail. 
On the other hand, bitmap graphics have a pre-
determined amount of pixels creating them, so 
you can’t scale (resize) them easily — if you 
scale them smaller, you throw out pixels; if you 
scale them larger, you end up with a blocky, 
jagged picture.
The following figure shows the differences 
between an enlarged vector graphic on the

This chapter gets you started with Illustrator and helps you understand 
when Illustrator is the tool that’s best suited for creating your art.
Deciding When to Use Illustrator CS4
So how do you draw the line and decide when to create graphics in 
Illustrator rather than Photoshop? By using Illustrator, you gain the 
following benefits:

✦ Illustrator can save and export graphics into most file formats. By 
choosing to save or export, you can create a file that can be used in 
most other applications. For instance, Illustrator files can be saved as 
.svg, .bmp, .tiff, .pdf, .jpg, and even as a Flash .swf file, to name 
a few.
 
✦ Illustrator files are easily integrated into other Adobe applications. 
You can save Illustrator files in their native format and open or place 
them in other Adobe applications, such as InDesign, Photoshop, 
Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and Flash. You can also save Illustrator art-
work as a .pdf (Portable Document Format). This format allows anyone 
with the free Acrobat Reader software to open and view the file, but 
editing capabilities are still maintained when the file is opened later in 
Illustrator.
 
✦ Illustrator is resolution-independent because the resolution of vector 
artwork isn’t determined until output. In other words, if you print to a 
600-dpi (dots per inch) printer, the artwork is printed at 600 dpi; print 
to a 2,400-dpi printer, and the artwork prints at 2,400 dpi. Illustrator 
graphics are very different from the bitmap images you create or edit in 
Photoshop, where resolution is determined upon creation of the artwork.
 
✦ Illustrator has limitless scalability. You can create vector artwork in 
Illustrator and scale it to the size of your thumb or the size of a barn, 
and it still looks good. See the “Vector graphics” sidebar in this chapter 
for more information.
Opening an Existing Document
To familiarize yourself with the basics of Illustrator and what the work area 
looks like, jump right in by opening an existing document in Illustrator. If you 
don’t have an Illustrator file created already, you can open one of the sample 
files packaged with the Illustrator application. For example, you can open 
the Loyal Order of Wormword in the Sample Art folder. The path to the 
file is C:\Programs\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS4\Cool Extras\
Sample Files\Sample Art (Windows) or Applications\Adobe 
Illustrator CS3\Cool Extras\Sample Files\Sample Art (Mac).
When you launch Illustrator CS4 for the first time, a Welcome screen 
appears, giving you various options. Click the Open icon and then browse to 
locate a file to open. (Note: You can select the Don’t Show Again check box if 
you don’t want to see the Welcome screen at launch.)

Creating a New Document
224
If your preferences have been changed from the original defaults, the 
Welcome screen may not appear. To open a file in that case, choose 
File➪Open and select the file in the Open dialog box. The Open dialog box is 
used to open existing Adobe Illustrator files or even files from other Adobe 
applications.
 
Choose File➪Open to open PDFs in Illustrator as well as many other file formats.
Creating a New Document
To create a new document in Illustrator, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-1. This 
dialog box enables you to determine the new document’s profile, size, 
units of measurement, color mode, and page orientation, as well as how 
many artboards (pages) you want in the document.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Creating 
a new 
document in 
Illustrator.
 
 
2. Enter a name for your new file in the Name text field.
 
 You can determine the name of the file now or later when you save the 
document.
 
3. Choose a profile from the New Document Profile drop-down list.
 
 Selecting the correct profile sets up preferences, such as resolution and 
colors, correctly. Click the Advanced down arrow (in the lower left of 
the New Document dialog box) to see what settings are selected for each 
profile and change them if necessary.

4. Enter the number of artboards that you want in the document in the 
Number of Artboards text box.
 
 If you want a single page document, leave this set at 1.
 
5. Enter how much space you want between artboards in the Spacing 
text box.
 
 If you want pages butting up to each other, enter 0 (zero) or enter addi-
tional values if you want a little space between each artboard. If you’re 
adding artboards, you can enter how many columns of artboards that 
you want arranged in the document in the Columns text box.
 
6. Choose from the Size drop-down list or type measurements in the 
Width and Height text fields to set the size of the document page.
 
 The size can be set from several standard sizes available in the Size 
drop-down list, or you can enter your own measurements in the Width 
and Height text fields. Note that several Web sizes are listed first, fol-
lowed by other typical paper sizes.
 
7. Choose from the Units drop-down list to select the type of measure-
ment that you’re most comfortable with.
 
 Your selection sets all measurement boxes and rulers to the increments 
you choose: points, picas, inches, millimeters, centimeters, or pixels.
 
8. Pick the orientation for the artboard.
 
 The artboard is your canvas for creating your artwork in Illustrator. You 
can choose between Portrait (the short sides of the artboard at the top 
and bottom) and Landscape (the long sides of the artboard on the top 
and bottom).
 
9. Add values into the Bleed text boxes if necessary.
 
 A bleed value is the amount of image area that extends beyond the art-
board. If you want to print from edge to edge, enter a value for the bleed. 
Keep in mind that most desktop printers need a grip area that forces any 
image area near the edge of a page to not print. Bleeds are typically used 
in jobs that will be printed off a press.
 
10. When you’re finished making your selections, click OK.
 
 An Illustrator artboard(s) appears.
 
Don’t worry if document size and color mode need to be changed at a later 
point. You can change them by choosing File➪Document Setup and by 
making changes in the Document Setup dialog box.

Taking a Look at the Document Window
226
Taking a Look at the Document Window
To investigate the work area and really get familiar with Illustrator, open 
a new document and take a look around. In the Illustrator work area, you 
have a total of 227 inches in width and height to create your artwork (and all 
artboards) in. That’s great, but it also leaves enough space to lose objects, 
too! The following list explains the areas that you’ll work with as you create 
artwork in Illustrator:
 
✦ Imageable area: The space inside the innermost dotted lines, which 
marks the printing area on the page. Many printers can’t print all the 
way to the edges of the paper, so the imageable area is determined by 
the printer that you’ve selected in the Print dialog box. To turn off or on 
this dotted border, choose View➪Hide/Show Page Tiling.
 
 You can move the imageable area around on your page by using the 
Print Tiling tool. See the nearby sidebar, “The Print Tiling tool,” for more 
on this tool.
 
✦ Edge of the page: The page’s edge is marked by the outermost set of 
dotted lines.
 
✦ Nonimageable area: Choose View➪Show Page Tiling to see the image-
able area based upon the selected print driver. The space on the outside 
of the dotted lines represents the imageable area and the edge of the 
page. The nonimageable area is the margin of the page that can’t be 
printed on.
 
✦ Artboard: The area bounded by solid lines that represents the entire 
region that can contain printable artwork. By default, the artboard is 
the same size as the page, but it can be enlarged or reduced. The U.S. 
default artboard is 8.5 x 11 inches, but it can be set as large as 227 x 227 
inches. You can hide the artboard boundaries by choosing View➪Hide 
Artboard.
 
✦ Scratch area: The area outside the artboard(s) that extends to the edge 
of the 227-inch square window. The scratch area represents a space on 
which you can create, edit, and store elements of artwork before moving 
them onto the artboard. Objects placed onto the scratch area are visible 
on-screen, but they don’t print. However, objects in the scratch area 
will appear if the document is saved and placed as an image in other 
applications.
 
Basically, the rules regarding the work area are simple: If you’re printing 
directly from Illustrator, make sure that you choose the proper paper size 
and printer in the Print dialog box. Open the Print dialog box by choosing 
File➪Print.

Becoming Familiar with the Tools
As you begin using Illustrator, you’ll find it helpful to be familiar with its 
tools. Tools are used to create, select, and manipulate objects in Illustrator. 
The tools should be visible as a default, but if not, you can access them by 
choosing Window➪Tools.
Table 2-1 lists the tools that we show you how to use throughout this mini-
book. Hover the cursor over the tool in the toolbox to see the name of the 
tool appear in a ToolTip. In parentheses on the ToolTip (and noted in the 
second column of Table 2-1) is the keyboard command that you can use to 
access that tool. When you see a small triangle at the lower-right corner of 
the tool icon, it contains additional hidden tools. Select the tool and hold the 
mouse button to see any hidden tools.
The Print Tiling tool
Use the Print Tiling tool to move the printable 
area of your page to a different location. For 
example, if you have a printer that can print 
only on paper that’s 8.5 x 11 inches or less, but 
you have a page size of 11 x 17, you can use the 
Print Tiling tool (a hidden tool accessed by hold-
ing down the mouse button on the Hand tool) to 
indicate what part of the page you want to print. 
Follow these steps to use the Print Tiling tool:
 1. When adjusting page boundaries, choose 
View➪Fit in Window so that you can see 
all your artwork.
 2. Hold down on the Hand tool to select the 
hidden Print Tiling tool.
 
 The pointer becomes a dotted cross when 
you move it to the active window.
 3. Position the mouse over the artboard and 
click and drag the page to a new location.
 
 While you drag, the Print Tiling tool acts as 
if you’re moving the page from its lower-left 
corner. Two gray rectangles are displayed. 
The outer rectangle represents the page 
size, and the inner rectangle represents 
the printable area of a page. You can move 
the page anywhere on the artboard; just 
remember that any part of a page that 
extends past the printable area boundary 
won’t print.

Checking Out the Panels
230
Checking Out the Panels
The standardized interface is a great boost for users as Illustrator’s panel 
system is similar to all the other products in the Adobe Creative Suite. This 
consistency makes working and finding tools and features easier.
When you first open Illustrator, notice that some of the panels that have 
been reduced to icons on the right. To select a panel, click the appropriate 
icon and the panel appears.
If all that you see is an icon, how do you know which icon brings up which 
panel? Good question. If you’re hunting around for the appropriate panels, 
you can do one of three things.
 
✦ Choose Window➪Name of Your Panel.
 
✦ Position your mouse on the left side of the icons and when you see the 
double-arrow icon, click and drag to the left. The panel names appear.
 
✦ Click the Expand Panels button in the gray bar at the top of the icons, 
as shown in Figure 2-2. The panels expand so that you can see their 
contents and names.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Expand the 
panels to 
see more 
options.
 
The panels that you see as a default are docked together. To dock a panel means 
that, for organizational purposes, the panel is attached in the docking area.
You can arrange panels to make them more helpful for production. You may 
choose to have only certain panels visible while working. Here’s the low-
down on using Illustrator’s panels:
 
✦ To see additional options for each panel (because some of these 
options are hidden), click the panel menu on the upper right of the 
panel (see Figure 2-3).
 
✦ To move a panel group, click and drag above the tabbed panel name.
 
✦ To rearrange or separate a panel from its group, drag the panel’s tab. 
Dragging a tab outside the docking area creates a new separate panel.
 
✦ To move a tab to another panel, drag the tab to that panel.

Figure 2-3: 
Some 
panels have 
additional 
options in 
the panel 
menu.
 
Look out for those panels — they can take over your screen! Some panels, 
but not all, can be resized. Panels that you can resize have an active lower-
right corner (denoted by three small lines in the corner). To change the size 
of a panel, drag the lower-right corner of the panel (Windows) or drag the 
size box at the lower-right corner of the panel (Mac).
 
As you become more efficient, you may find it helpful to reduce the 
clutter on your screen by hiding all panels except those that are 
necessary for your work. You can save your own panel configura-
tion by choosing Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace. Choose 
Window➪Workspace➪Essentials to return to the default workspace.
Changing Views
When you’re working in Illustrator, precision is important, but you also want 
to see how the artwork really looks. Whether for the Web or print, Illustrator 
offers several ways in which to view your artwork:
 
✦ Preview and Outline views: By default, Illustrator shows the Preview 
view, where you see colors, stroke widths, images, and patterns as they 
should appear when printed or completed for on-screen presentation. 
Sometimes this view can become a nuisance, especially if you have 
two thick lines and you’re trying to create a corner point by connect-
ing them. At times like this, or whenever you want the strokes and fills 
reduced to the underlying structure, choose View➪Outline. You now see 
the outline of the illustration, as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
✦ Pixel view: If you don’t want to be surprised when your artwork appears 
in your Web browser, use the Pixel view. This view, as shown in Figure 
2-5, maintains the vectors of your artwork but gives you a view showing 
how the pixels will appear when the image is viewed on-screen, as if on 
the Web.

Figure 2-5: 
See how 
your

 Pixel view is great for previewing what your text will look like on-screen — 
some fonts just don’t look good as pixels, especially if the text is small. With 
Pixel view, you can go through several different fonts until you find one that 
is easily readable as pixels.
 
✦ Overprint view: For people in print production, the Overprint preview 
can be a real timesaver. Choose Window➪Attributes to bring up the 
Attributes panel, which you can use to set the fill and stroke colors to 
overprint. This view creates additional colors when printing and aids 
printers when trapping abutting colors.

Book III
Chapter 2
Discovering 
Illustrator CS4
Navigating the Work Area with Zoom Controls
233
 
 Trapping is the slight overprint of a lighter color into a darker color 
to correct for press misregistration. When several colors are printed 
on one piece, the likelihood that they’ll be perfectly aligned is pretty 
slim! Setting a stroke to Overprint on the Window➪Attributes panel is 
one solution. With Overprint selected, the stroke is overprinted on the 
touching colors. This mixing of color produces an additional color, but 
is less obvious to the viewer than a white space created by misregistra-
tion. Select Overprint to see the result of overprinting in Overprint view, 
as shown in Figure 2-6.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Overprint 
view.
 
Navigating the Work Area with Zoom Controls
You can navigate the work area efficiently by using the Hand tool and the 
various zoom controls. You can change the magnification of the artboard in 
several ways, including using menu items, the Zoom tool, and keyboard com-
mands. Choose the method you feel most comfortable with:
 
 
✦ Hand tool: Scroll around the Document window by using the scrollbars 
or the Hand tool. The Hand tool gives you the ability to scroll by drag-
ging. You can imagine you’re pushing a piece of paper around on your 
desk when you use the Hand tool.
 
 Hold down the spacebar to temporarily access the Hand tool while any 
tool (except the Type tool) is selected. Holding down the spacebar while 
the Type tool is selected only gives you spaces!
 
✦ View menu: With the View menu, you can easily select the magnification 
that you want by using Zoom In, Zoom Out, Fit in Window (especially 
useful when you get lost in the scratch area), and Actual Size (gives you 
a 100-percent view of your artwork).
 
 
✦ Crop Area tool: With the new Crop Area tool, you can define crop areas 
interactively for print or export. You can choose preset formats and 
define multiple crop areas.

Navigating the Work Area with Zoom Controls
234
 
 
✦ Zoom tool: With the Zoom tool, you can click the Document window to 
zoom in; to zoom out, Alt+click (Windows) or Option+click (Mac). 
Double-click with the Zoom tool to quickly resize the Document window 
to 100 percent. Control what is visible when using the Zoom tool by 
clicking and dragging over the area that you want zoomed into.
 
✦ Keyboard shortcuts: If you’re not the type of person who likes to use key-
board shortcuts, you may change your mind about using them for mag-
nification. They make sense and are easy to use and remember. Table 2-2 
lists the most popular keyboard shortcuts to change magnification.
 
 The shortcuts in Table 2-2 require a little coordination to use, but they 
give you more control in your zoom. While holding down the keys, drag 
from the upper-left to the bottom-right corner of the area you want to 
zoom to. A marquee appears while you’re dragging; when you release 
the mouse button, the selected area zooms up to the size of your 
window! The Zoom Out command doesn’t give you that much control; it 
simply zooms back out, much like the commands in Table 2-3.

Chapter 3: Using the 
Selection Tools
In This Chapter
✓ Knowing the anchor points, bounding boxes, and selection tools
✓ Working with a selection
✓ Grouping and ungrouping selections
✓ Constraining movement and cloning objects
I
f someone’s been coaching you in using Adobe Illustrator, you may have 
heard the old line, “You have to select it to affect it.” This is because if 
you want to apply a change to an object in Illustrator, you must have that 
object selected, or Illustrator won’t know what to change. You’ll sit there 
clicking a color swatch over and over again, and nothing will happen. 
Although making selections may sound simple, it can become tricky when 
you’re working on complicated artwork.
Getting to Know the Selection Tools
Before delving into the world of selecting objects in Illustrator, you must 
know what the selection tools are. In this section, we take you through a 
quick tour of the anchor points (integral to the world of selections), the 
bounding box, and, of course, the selection tools (yes, there are several 
selection tools).
Anchor points
To understand selections, you must first understand how Illustrator works 
with anchor points. Anchor points act like handles and can be individually 
selected and moved to other locations. Essentially, the anchor points are 
what you use to drag objects or parts of objects around the workspace. 
After you place anchor points on an object, you can create strokes or paths 
from the anchor points.
You can select several anchor points at the same time (as shown in Figure 
3-1) or only one (as shown in Figure 3-2). Selecting all anchor points in an 
object lets you move the entire object without changing the anchor points 
in relationship to one another. You can tell which anchor points are 
selected and active because they appear as solid boxes.

Multiple

Figure 3-2:

Bounding boxes
As a default, Illustrator shows a bounding box when an object is selected 
with the Selection tool (a bounding box is shown in Figure 3-1). This feature 
can be helpful if you understand its function, but confusing if you don’t know 
how to use it.
By dragging on the handles, you can use the bounding box for quick trans-
forms, such as scaling and rotating. To rotate, you pass the mouse cursor 
(without clicking) outside a handle until you see a rotate symbol and then 
drag.
If the bounding box bothers you, you can turn off the feature by choosing 
View➪Hide Bounding Box.
Selection tools
Illustrator CS4 offers five selection tools:
 
✦ Selection: Selects entire objects or groups. This tool activates all anchor 
points in an object or group at the same time, allowing you to move an 
object without changing its shape.
 
✦ Direct Selection: Selects individual points.

Book III
Chapter 3
Using the 
Selection Tools
Working with Selections
237
 
✦ Group Selection: Hidden in the Direct Selection tool in the toolbox, you 
use this tool to select items within a group. This tool adds grouped 
items as you click an object in the order in which objects were grouped. 
This selection tool will become more useful to you as you find out about 
grouping objects in Illustrator.
 
✦ Magic Wand: Use the Magic Wand tool to select objects with like values, 
such as fill and stroke colors, based upon a tolerance and stroke weight. 
Change the options of this tool by double-clicking it.
 
✦ Lasso: Use the Lasso tool to click and drag around anchor points that 
you want to select.
You can select an object with the Selection tool using one of three main 
methods:
 
✦ Click the object’s path.
 
✦ Click an anchor point of the object.
 
✦ Drag a marquee around part or all the object’s path. (In the later 
section, “Using a marquee to select an object,” we discuss using the 
marquee method.)
Working with Selections
After you have an understanding about the basics of selections, you’ll 
probably be anxious to try out some techniques. In this section, you’re intro-
duced to the basics: making a selection, working with anchor points and the 
marquee, making multiple selections, and of course, saving your work.
 
Smart guides are turned on by default in Illustrator CS4, and can help you to 
make accurate selections. These guides are visible as you are drawing, they 
display names like anchor point and path, and they also highlight paths 
when you are lined up with endpoints or center points. You can come to 
love these helpful aides, but if you don’t want to see them, simply choose 
View➪Smart Guides, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+U (Windows) or 
Ô+U (Mac) to toggle the Smart guides off and on.
Creating a selection
To work with selections, you need to actually have something on the page in 
Illustrator. Use the following steps to make a selection:
 
1. Create a new page in Adobe Illustrator (any size or profile is okay).
 
 Alternatively, you can open an existing illustration; see Chapter 2 of 
this minibook for instructions. Skip to Step 3 if working with an existing 
illustration.

Working with Selections
238
 
2. If you’re starting from a new page, create an object to work with.
 
 For example, click and hold down on the Rectangle tool to select the 
Star tool. Then click and drag from the top left to the lower right to 
create a star shape.
 
 Exact size doesn’t matter, but make it large enough that you can see it. 
To start over, choose Edit➪Undo, or press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ô+Z 
(Mac).
 
 As a default, all shapes start with a black stroke and a white fill (see 
Figure 3-3). If yours isn’t black and white, press D, which changes the 
selected object to the default colors.
 
 You can see the width and height of your object while you click and 
drag. If you don’t want those values to display, choose Edit➪
Preferences➪Smart Guides (Windows) or Illustrator➪Preferences➪
Smart Guides (Mac) and deselect the Measurements Labels check box.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Create 
a shape 
with the

tools.
 
 
3. With the Selection tool, click the object to make sure that it’s active.
 
 All anchor points are solid, indicating that all anchor points are active, 
as shown in Figure 3-3. As a default, you see many additional points that 
you can use to transform your selected object.
 
4. Click and drag the shape to another location.
 
 All anchor points travel together.
 
5. When completed, deactivate your selection.
 
 You can use one of these three methods:
 
• Choose Select➪Deselect.
 
• Ctrl-click (Windows) or Ô-click (Mac) anywhere on the page.
 
• Use the key command Ctrl+Shift+A (Windows) or Ô+Shift+A (Mac).
Selecting an anchor point
When you have a selection to work with (see the preceding numbered list), 
you can deselect all the active anchor points and then make just one anchor 
point active. Follow these steps:

1. Choose Select➪Deselect to make sure the object isn’t selected.
 
2. Select the Direct Selection tool (the white arrow) from the toolbox.
 
3. Click one anchor point.
 
 Only one anchor point (the one you clicked) is solid, and the others are 
hollow, as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Select only 
one anchor 
point.
 
 
4. Click and drag that solid anchor point with the Direct Selection tool.
 
 Only that solid anchor point moves.
 
Note that an anchor point enlarges when you cross over it with the Direct 
Selection tool. This enlargement is a big break for those who typically have 
to squint to see where the anchor points are positioned.
Using a marquee to select an object
Sometimes it’s easier to surround what you want selected by dragging the 
mouse to create a marquee. Follow these steps to select an object by 
creating a marquee:
 
1. Choose the Selection tool.
 
2. Click outside the object and drag over a small part of it, as shown in 
Figure 3-5.
 
 The entire object becomes selected.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Select 
an entire 
object.
 
You can also select just one anchor point in an object by using the marquee 
method:
 
1. Choose Select➪Deselect to make sure the object isn’t selected and 
then choose the Direct Selection tool.

Working with Selections

2. Click outside a corner of the object and drag over just the anchor 
point that you want to select.
 
 Notice that only that anchor point is active, which can be a sight-saver 
when you’re trying to select individual points (see Figure 3-6).
 
Figure 3-6: 
Select 
individual 
anchor 
points.
 
 
You can use this method to cross over just the two top points or side anchor 
points to activate multiple anchor points as well.
Selecting multiple objects
If you have multiple items on your page, you can select them by using one of 
the following methods:
 
✦ Select one object or anchor point and then hold down the Shift key 
and click another object or anchor point. Depending on which selec-
tion tool you’re using, you’ll either select all anchor points on an object 
(Selection tool) or additional anchor points only (Direct Selection tool).
 
 You can use the Shift key to deactivate an object as well. Shift+click a 
selected object to deselect it.
 
✦ Choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Ô+A (Mac).
 
✦ Use the marquee selection technique and drag outside and over the 
objects. When you use this technique with the Selection tool, all anchor 
points in the objects are selected; with the Direct Selection tool, only 
the points that you drag over are selected.
Saving a selection
Spending way too much time trying to make your selections? Illustrator 
comes to the rescue with the Save Selection feature. After you have a 
selection that you may need again, choose Select➪Save Selection and name 
the selection. The selection now appears at the bottom of the Select menu. 
To change the name or delete the saved selection, choose Select➪Edit 
Selection. This selection is saved with the document.

Grouping and Ungrouping
241
Grouping and Ungrouping
Keep objects together by grouping them. The Group function is handy in a 
situation when you’re creating something from multiple objects, such as a 
logo. With the Group function, you can make sure all the objects that make 
up the logo stay together when you move, rotate, scale, or copy it.
Creating a group
Follow these steps to create a group:
 
1. If you aren’t already working with an illustration that contains a 
whole bunch of objects, create several objects on a new page — 
anywhere, any size.
 
 For example, select the Rectangle tool and click and drag on the page 
several times to create additional rectangles.
 
2. Select the first object with the Selection tool and then hold down the 
Shift key and click a second object.
 
3. Choose Object➪Group or press Ctrl+G (Windows) or Ô+G (Mac).
 
4. Choose Select➪Deselect and then click one of the objects with the 
Selection tool.
 
 Both objects become selected.
 
5. While the first two objects are still selected, Shift+click a third object.
 
6. With all three objects selected, choose Object➪Group again.
 
 Illustrator remembers the grouping order. To prove it, choose Select➪
Deselect to deselect the group and switch to the Group Selection tool. 
(Hold down the mouse button on the Direct Selection tool to access the 
Group Selection tool.)
 
7. With the Group Selection tool, click the first object, and all anchor 
points become active. Click the first object again, and the second 
object becomes selected. Click the first object yet again, and the 
third object becomes selected.
 
 This tool activates the objects in the order that you grouped them. After 
you group the objects together, you can treat them as a single object.
To ungroup objects, choose Object➪Ungroup or use the key command 
Ctrl+Shift+G (Windows) or Ô+Shift+G (Mac). In a situation where you group 
objects twice (because you added an object to the group, for example), 
you’d have to choose Ungroup twice.

Manipulating Selected Objects
242
Using the Isolation mode
Now in Illustrator you can take advantage of the Isolation mode, which 
allows you to easily select and edit objects in a group without disturbing 
other parts of your artwork. Simply double-click a group, and it opens in a 
separate Isolation mode, where all objects outside the group are dimmed 
and inactive. Do the work that you need to on the group and exit out of 
the Isolation mode by clicking the arrow to the left of Group in the upper 
right of the window, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
 In Illustrator CS4, you can choose the Isolate Selected Object button in the 
Control panel to quickly access the Isolation mode.
 
Figure 3-7: 
The 
Isolation 
mode allows 
you to 
edit group 
contents 
without 
disturbing 
other 
artwork.
 
Manipulating Selected Objects
In the following list, you discover a few other cool things that you can do 
with selected objects:
 
✦ Moving selected objects: When an object is selected, you can drag it to 
any location on the page, but what if you only want to nudge it a bit? To 
nudge an item one pixel at a time, select it with the Selection tool and 
press the left-, right-, up-, or down-arrow key to reposition the object. 
Hold down the Shift key as you press an arrow key to move an object by 
ten pixels at a time.
 
✦ Constraining movement: Want to move an object over to the other side 
of the page without changing its alignment? Constrain something by 
selecting an object with the Selection tool and dragging the item and 
then holding down the Shift key before you release the mouse button. 
By pressing the Shift key mid-drag, you constrain the movement to 
45-, 90-, or 180-degree angles!

✦ Cloning selected objects: Use the Selection tool to easily clone (dupli-
cate) an item and move it to a new location. To clone an item, simply 
select it with the Selection tool and then hold down the Alt key 
(Windows) or Option key (Mac). Look for the cursor to change to two 
arrows (see Figure 3-8) and then drag the item to another location on 
the page. Notice that the original object is left intact and that a copy of 
the object has been created and moved.
 
Figure 3-8: 
Drag the 
double 
arrow to 
clone an 
object.
 
 
✦ Constraining the clone: By Alt+dragging (Windows) or Option+dragging 
(Mac) an item and then pressing Shift, you can clone the item and keep 
it aligned with the original. Remember: Don’t hold down the Shift key 
until you’re in the process of dragging the item; otherwise, pressing Shift 
will deselect the original object.
 
 After you clone an object to a new location, try this neat trick where you 
create multiple objects equally apart from each other with the 
Transform Again command: Choose Object➪Transform➪Transform 
Again, or press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Ô+D (Mac) to have another object 
cloned the exact distance as the first cloned object (see Figure 3-9). We 
discuss transforms in more detail in Chapter 10 of this minibook.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Using the 
Transform 
Again 
command.
 
 
✦ Using the Select menu: With the Select menu, you can gain additional 
selection controls, such as choosing Select➪Inverse, which allows 
you to select one object and then turn your selection inside out. Also, 
choosing the Select➪Select Same option allows you to select one object 
and then select additional objects on the page based upon similarities in 
color, fill, stroke, and other special attributes.
 
 
 Take advantage of the new Select Similar button on the Control panel to 
easily access that feature.

Chapter 4: Creating Basic Shapes
In This Chapter
✓ Introducing rectangles, ellipses, stars, and polygons
✓ Resizing shapes after creation
✓ Creating shapes
S
hapes, shapes, shapes . . . they’re everywhere in Illustrator. Basic 
shapes, such as squares, circles, polygons, and stars, are used in all 
types of illustrations. With the right know-how and the right shape tools, 
you can easily create these shapes exactly the way you want. In this chap-
ter, we show you how to use these tools to control a shape’s outcome, 
create shapes based on precise measurements, and change the number of 
points a star has.
The Basic Shape Tools
As a default, the only visible shape tool in the toolbox is the Rectangle 
tool. Click and hold down that tool, and you have access to the Rounded 
Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, and Star tools, as shown in Figure 4-1. (Although 
you see the Flare tool, it’s not a basic shape.)
 
Figure 4-1: 
The basic 
shape tools.
 
 
You can tear off this tool set so that you don’t have to find the hidden 
shapes in the future. Click and hold on the Rectangle tool and drag to the 
arrow on the far right. Wait until you see the pop-up hint (Tearoff) and then 
release the mouse button. These tools are now in a free-floating toolbar that 
you can drag to another location.

The Basic Shape Tools
246
Creating rectangles and ellipses
Rectangles and ellipses are the most fundamental shapes that you can create 
(see Figure 4-2). To create a rectangle shape freehand, select the Rectangle 
tool and simply click the page where you want the shape to appear. Then 
drag diagonally toward the opposite side, drag it the distance that you want 
the shape to be in size, and release the mouse button. You can drag up or 
down. You do the same to create an ellipse with the Ellipse tool.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Click 
and drag 
diagonally 
to create a 
shape.
 
 
 After you create the shape, adjust its size and position by using the Selection 
tool. Reposition the shape by clicking the selected object and dragging. 
Resize the object by grabbing a handle and adjusting in or out. To adjust two 
sides together, grab a corner handle. To resize your shape proportionally, 
Shift+drag a corner handle.
Using the Rounded Rectangle tool
You can create a rounded rectangle by using one of two methods:
 
✦ Clicking and dragging freehand to create the rounded rectangle shape.
 
✦ Clicking once on the artboard to bring up the Rounded Rectangle dialog 
box, where you can enter values to define the shape.
The difference between these two methods is that when you open the 
Rounded Rectangle dialog box (see Figure 4-3), you can enter a value in the 
Corner Radius text field, which determines how much rounding is applied 
to the corners of the shape. The smaller the value, the less rounded the 
corners will be; the higher the value, the more rounded. Be careful; you can 
actually round a rectangle’s corners so much that it becomes an ellipse!

a rounded 
rectangle.

Resizing Shapes
247
Using the Polygon tool
You create stars and polygons in much the same way as the rectangles 
and ellipses. Select the Polygon tool and click and drag from one corner to 
another to create the default six-sided polygon shape. You can also select 
the Polygon tool and click once on the artboard to change the Polygon tool 
options in the Polygon dialog box.
You can change the polygon shape by entering new values in the Radius 
and Sides text fields, as shown in Figure 4-4. The radius is determined from 
the center to the edge of the polygon. The value for the number of sides can 
range from 3 (making triangles a breeze to create) to 1,000. Whoa . . . a poly-
gon with 1,000 sides would look like a circle unless it was the size of Texas!
 
Figure 4-4: 
Creating 
a polygon 
shape.
 
Using the Star tool
To create a star shape, select the Star tool from the toolbox. (Remember 
that it may be hiding under other shape tools.) If you click once on the art-
board to bring up the Star dialog box, you see three text fields in which you 
can enter values to customize your star shape:
 
✦ Radius 1: Distance from the outer points to the center of the star.
 
✦ Radius 2: Distance from the inner points to the center of the star.
 
✦ Points: Number of points that make up the star.
The closer together the Radius 1 and Radius 2 values are to each other, the 
shorter the points on your star. In other words, you can go from a starburst 
to a seal of approval by entering values that are close in the Radius 1 and 
Radius 2 text fields, as shown in Figure 4-5.
Resizing Shapes
You often need a shape to be an exact size (for example, 2 x 3 inches). After 
you create a shape, the best way to resize it to exact measurements is to use 
the Transform panel, as shown in Figure 4-6. Have your object selected and 
then choose Window➪Transform to open the Transform panel. Note that on 
this panel, you can enter values to place an object in the X and Y fields, as 

Resizing Shapes
248
well as enter values in the width (W) and height (H) text fields to determine 
the exact size of an object.
 
Figure 4-5: 
Radius 1 
and Radius 
2 are closer 
to each 
other in the 
star on the 
bottom.
 
In many of the Adobe Illustrator panels, you may see measurement increments 
consisting of points, picas, millimeters, centimeters, or inches, which can be 
confusing and maybe even intimidating. But you can control which measure-
ment increments to use.
 
Show rulers by choosing View➪Show Rulers or press Ctrl+R (Windows) or 
Ô+R (Mac). Then right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the ruler to 
change the measurement increment to an increment you’re more familiar 
with. The contextual menu that appears allows you to change the measure-
ment increment right on the document.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Precisely 
set the size 
of a shape.
 
Alternatively, you can simply type the number followed by a measurement 
extension into the width and height text fields in the Transform panel (refer 
to Figure 4-6), and the measurement converts properly for you. Table 4-1 
lists the extensions that you can use.

If you don’t want to bother creating a shape freehand and then changing the 
size, select the shape tool and click the artboard. An Options dialog box spe-
cific to the shape you’re creating appears, in which you can type values into 
the width and height text fields.
If you accidentally click and drag, you end up with a very small shape on 
your page. If this happens, don’t fret. Simply get rid of the small shape by 
selecting it and pressing the Delete key, and then try again.
Tips for Creating Shapes
The following are simple tips to improve your skills at creating basic shapes 
in Illustrator:
 
✦ Press and hold the Shift key while dragging with the Rectangle or 
Ellipse tool to create a perfect square or circle. This trick is also helpful 
when you’re using the Polygon and Star tools — holding down the Shift 
key constrains them so that they’re straight (see Figure 4-7).
 
✦ Create a shape from the center out by holding down the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac) key while dragging. Hold down Alt+Shift 
(Windows) or Option+Shift (Mac) to pull a constrained shape out from 
the center.
 
✦ When creating a star or polygon shape by clicking and dragging, if 
you keep the mouse button down, you can then press the up- or down-
arrow key to interactively add points or sides to your shape.

Creating advanced shapes
At times, it may be much easier to use advanced tools in Illustrator to create 
unique shapes. The Pathfinder panel is an incredible tool that allows you to 
combine, knock out, and even create shapes from other intersected shapes.
You use the Pathfinder panel, as shown in Figure 4-8, to combine objects 
into new shapes. To use the Pathfinder panel, choose Window➪Pathfinder.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Combine 
objects into 
new shapes.
 
Across the top row of the Pathfinder panel are the Shape Modes, which let 
you control the interaction between selected shapes. You can choose from 
the shape modes listed in Table 4-2.
Table 4-2 
Shape Modes
Button
Mode
What It Does
Add to Shape Area
Essentially unites the selected shape 
into one.
Subtract from Shape 
Area
Cuts out the topmost shape from the 
underlying shape.
Intersect Shape Areas
Uses the area of the topmost shape 
to clip the underlying shape as a 
mask would.
Exclude Overlapping 
Shape Areas
Uses the area of the shape to invert 
the underlying shape, turning filled 
regions into holes and vice versa.
 
If you like the result from using the Exclude Overlapping Shapes mode, 
you can also get a similar effect by selecting several shapes and choosing 
Object➪Compound Path➪Make. This command takes the topmost shapes 
and “punches” them out of the bottom shape.

The shapes remain separate so that you can still adjust them, which is great 
if you like to tweak your artwork (but it drives some people crazy). You can 
turn the results of using the Shape Mode buttons into one shape by either 
clicking the Expand button after selecting the shape mode or holding down 
the Alt key (Windows) or Option key (Mac) when clicking a Shape Mode 
button.
Using the Pathfinders
The Pathfinders are the buttons at the bottom of the Pathfinder panel. They 
also let you create new shapes out of overlapping objects. Table 4-3 offers a 
summary of what each Pathfinder does.

What It Does
Divide
Divides all the shapes into their own individual 
shapes. This tool is actually very useful tool when 
you’re trying to create custom shapes.
Trim
Removes the part of a filled object that’s hidden.
Merge
Removes the part of a filled object that’s hidden. Also 
removes any strokes and merges any adjoining or 
overlapping objects filled with the same color.
Crop
Deletes all parts of the artwork that fall outside the 
boundary of the topmost object. It also removes 
any strokes. If you want your strokes to remain 
when using this feature, select them and choose 
Object➪Path➪Outline Stroke.
Outline
Divides an object into its shape’s line segments, or

and Placing Images
In This Chapter
✓ Familiarizing yourself with the Pen tool
✓ Creating paths, closed shapes, and curves
✓ Using the hidden Pen tools
✓ Tracing some artwork
✓ Placing images in Illustrator CS4
✓ Working with Layer Comps
You’ve seen illustrations that you know are made from paths, but how 
do you make your own? In this chapter, we show you how to use the 
Pen tool to create paths and closed shapes.
 
The Pen tool requires a little more coordination than other Illustrator tools. 
Fortunately, Adobe Illustrator CS4 includes new features to help make using 
the Pen tool a little easier. After you master the Pen tool, the possibilities 
for creating illustrations are unlimited. Read this chapter to build your skills 
with the most popular feature in graphic software, the Bézier curve.
Pen Tool Fundamentals
 
 
You can use the Pen tool to create all sorts of things, such as straight lines, 
curves, and closed shapes, which you can then incorporate into illustrations:
 
✦ Bézier curve: Originally developed by Pierre Bézier in the 1970s for 
CAD/CAM operations, the Bézier curve (as shown in Figure 5-1) became 
the underpinnings of the entire Adobe PostScript drawing model. A 
Bézier curve is one that you can control the depth and size of by using 
direction lines.

Pen Tool Fundamentals
254
 
Figure 5-1: 
Bézier 
curves are 
controlled 
by direction 
lines.
 
 
✦ Anchor points: You can use anchor points to control the shape of a path 
or object. Anchor points are created automatically when using shape 
tools. You can manually create anchor points by clicking from point to 
point with the Pen tool.
 
✦ Direction lines: These lines are essentially the handles that you use on 
curved points to adjust the depth and angle of curved paths.
 
✦ Closed shape: When a path is created, it becomes a closed shape when 
the start point joins the endpoint.
 
✦ Simple path: A path consists of one or more straight or curved seg-
ments. Anchor points mark the endpoints of the path segments.
In the next section, we show you how to control the anchor points.
Creating a straight line
A basic function of the Pen tool is to create a simple path. You can create a 
simple, straight line with the Pen tool by following these steps:
 
1. Press D or click the small black-and-white color swatches at the 
bottom of the toolbox.
 
 You revert back to the default colors of a black stroke and a white fill. 
With black as a stroke, you can see your path clearly.
 
 The trick of pressing D to change the foreground and background colors 
to the default of black and white also works in Photoshop and InDesign.
 
2. Click the Fill swatch, located at the bottom of the toolbox, to make 
sure that the Fill swatch is in front of the Stroke swatch and then press 
the forward slash (/) key to change the fill to None.
 
3. Open a new blank page and select the Pen tool.
 
 Notice that when you move the mouse over the artboard, the Pen cursor 
appears with an X beside it, indicating that you’re creating the first 
anchor point of a path.

Book III
Chapter 5

and Placing Images
255
Pen Tool Fundamentals
255
 
4. Click the artboard to create the first anchor point of a line.
 
 The X disappears.
 
 Don’t drag the mouse, or you’ll end up creating a curve instead of a 
straight segment.
 
5. Click anywhere else on the document to create the ending anchor 
point of the line.
 
 Illustrator creates a path between the two anchor points. Essentially, 
the path looks like a line segment with an anchor point at each end (see 
Figure 5-2).
 
Figure 5-2: 
A path 
connected 
by two 
anchor 
points.
 
To make a correction to a line you created with the Pen tool (as described in 
the preceding steps), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Select➪Deselect to make sure that no objects are selected cur-
rently.
 
2. Select the Direct Selection tool from the toolbox.
 
 Notice the helpful feature that enlarges the anchor point when you pass 
over it with the Direct Selection tool.
 
3. Click an anchor to select one point on the line.
 
 Notice that the selected anchor point is solid and the other is hollow. 
Solid indicates that the anchor point you clicked is active whereas 
hollow is inactive.
 
4. Click and drag the anchor point with the Direct Selection tool.
 
 The selected anchor point moves, changing the direction of the path 
while not affecting the other anchor point. And that’s it.
 
Use the Direct Selection tool (press A to use the keyboard shortcut to select 
the Direct Selection tool) to make corrections to paths.

Pen Tool Fundamentals
256
Make sure that only the anchor point you want to change is active. If the 
entire path is selected, all anchor points are solid. If only one anchor point is 
selected, all but that one point will be hollow.
Creating a constrained straight line
In this section, we show you how to create a real straight line, meaning one 
that is on multiples of a 45-degree angle. Illustrator makes it easy; just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the Pen tool and click anywhere on the artboard to place an 
anchor point.
 
2. Hold down the Shift key and click another location to place the 
ending anchor point.
 
 Notice that when you’re holding the Shift key, the line snaps to a mul-
tiple of 45 degrees.
 
Release the mouse button before you release the Shift key or else the line 
pops out of alignment.
Creating a curve
In this section, you discover how to use the Bézier path to create a curved 
segment. We won’t guarantee that you’ll love it — not at first anyway. But 
after you know how to use a Bézier path, you’ll likely find it useful. To create 
a Bézier path, follow these steps:
 
1. Starting with a blank artboard, select the Pen tool and click anywhere 
on the artboard to place the first anchor point.
 
2. Click someplace else to place your ending anchor point but don’t let 
go of the mouse button and then drag the cursor until a direction line 
appears.
 
 If you look really close, you see that anchor points are square and the 
direction lines have circles at the end, as shown in Figure 5-3.

drag with 
the Pen tool 
to create a 
curved path.

and Placing Images
257

257
 
3. Drag the direction line closer to the anchor point to flatten the curve; 
drag farther away from the anchor point to increase the curve, as 
shown in Figure 5-4.
 
4. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the curve.
 
Figure 5-4: 
The 
directional 
lines 
determine 
how the 
curve 
appears.
 
You’ve created an open path, or a path that doesn’t form a closed shape. 
We show you how to reconnect to the starting point of the path to make a 
closed shape in the next section.
To alter a curved segment after you create it, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Select➪Deselect to make sure that no objects are currently 
selected.
 
2. Choose the Direct Selection tool and click the last anchor point 
created.
 
 If they’re not already visible, the direction lines appear.
 
 If you have a hard time selecting the anchor point, drag a marquee 
around it with the Direct Selection tool.
 
3. Click precisely at the end of one of the direction lines; drag the direc-
tion line to change the curve.
Reconnecting to an existing path
Creating one segment is fine if you just want a line or an arch. But if you 
want to create a shape, you need to add more anchor points to the original 
segment. If you want to fill your shape with a color or a gradient, you need 
to close it, meaning that you need to eventually come back to the starting 
anchor point.

Pen Tool Fundamentals
258
To add segments to your path and create a closed shape, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a segment (straight or curved).
 
 We show you how in the preceding sections of this chapter.
 
 You can continue from this point, clicking and adding anchor points 
until you eventually close the shape. For this example, you deselect the 
path so that you can discover how to continue adding to paths that have 
already been created. Knowing how to edit existing paths is extremely 
helpful when you need to make adjustments to artwork.
 
2. With the Pen tool selected, move the cursor over an end anchor point 
on the deselected path.
 
3. Click when you see the Pen icon with a forward slash to connect your 
next segment.
 
 The forward slash indicates that you’re connecting to this path.
 
4. Click someplace else to create the next anchor point in the path; drag 
the mouse if you want to create a curved segment.
 
5. Click to place additional anchor points, dragging as needed to curve 
those segments.
 
 Remember that you want to close this shape, so place your anchor 
points so that you can eventually come back to the first anchor point.
 
 Figure 5-5 shows a shape that’s a result of several linked anchor points.
 
6. When you get back to the first anchor point, move the cursor over 
it and click when the close icon (a small hollow circle) appears, as 
shown in Figure 5-6.
 
 The shape now has no end points.

Controlling the curves
After you feel comfortable creating curves and paths, take control of those 
curves so that you can create them with a greater degree of precision. The 
following steps walk you through the manual method for changing direc-
tion of anchor points, as well as reveal helpful keyboard commands to make 
controlling paths a little more fluid. At the end of this section, we introduce 
you to new tools that you may also want to take advantage of to help you get 
control of the Pen tool.
To control a curve, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new document and then choose View➪Show Grid to show a 
series of horizontal and vertical rules that act as guides.
 
 If it helps, use the Zoom tool to zoom in to the document.
 
2. With the Pen tool, click an intersection of any of these lines in the 
middle area of the page to place your initial anchor point and drag 
upward.
 
 Let go, but don’t click when the direction line has extended up to the 
horizontal grid line above it, as shown in Figure 5-7a.
 
3. Click to place the second anchor point on the intersection of the grid 
directly to the right of your initial point; drag the direction line down 
to the grid line directly below it, as shown in Figure 5-7b.
 
 If you have a hard time keeping the direction line straight, hold down 
the Shift key to constrain it.
 
4. Choose Select➪Deselect to deselect your curve.
 
 Congratulations! You’ve created a controlled curve. In these steps, we 
created an arch that’s going up, so we first clicked and dragged up. 
Likewise, to create a downward arch, you must click and drag down. 
With the grid, try to create a downward arch like the one shown in 
Figure 5-7c.

Creating a corner point
To change directions of a path from being a curve to a corner, you have to 
create a corner point, as shown on the right in Figure 5-8. A corner point has 
no direction lines and allows for a sharp direction change in a path.
You can switch from the Pen tool to the Convert Anchor Point tool to change 
a smooth anchor point into a corner point, but that process is a bit time-
consuming. An easier way is to press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key 
(the Pen tool temporarily changes into the Convert Anchor Point tool) while 
clicking the anchor point.
 
Figure 5-8: 
Smooth 
versus 
corner 
points.
 
To change a smooth anchor point into a corner point with the shortcut 
method, follow these steps:
 
1. Create an upward arch.
 
 We show you how in the preceding section, “Controlling the curves” 
(refer to Figure 5-7b).
 
2. Hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key and position the 
cursor over the last anchor point (the last point that you created with 
the Pen tool).
 
 
3. When the cursor changes to a caret (that’s the Convert Anchor Point 
tool), click and drag until the direction line is up to the grid line 
above, as shown on the left in Figure 5-9.
 
4. Release the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key and the mouse button, 
move the cursor to the grid line to the right, and click and drag down.

The Hidden Pen Tools
Hold down on the Pen tool icon in the toolbox to access additional tools: 
the Add Anchor Point, Delete Anchor Point, and Convert Anchor Point tools, 
shown in Table 5-1. In the preceding section, we show you how to create a 
corner point with the shortcut method, by pressing the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac) key to access the Convert Anchor Point tool. You may feel 
more comfortable switching to that tool when you need to convert a point, 
but switching tools can be more time-consuming.

Even though you can use a hidden tool to delete and add anchor points, 
Illustrator automatically does this as a default when you’re using the Pen 
tool. When you move the cursor over an anchor point with the Pen tool, 
a minus icon appears. To delete that anchor point, simply click. Likewise, 
when you move the cursor over a part of the path that doesn’t contain 
anchor points, a plus icon appears. Simply click to add an anchor point.

The Hidden Pen Tools
262
If you prefer to use the tools dedicated to adding and deleting anchor points, 
choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (Windows) or Illustrator➪Preferences➪
General (Mac); in the Preferences dialog box that appears, select the Disable 
Auto Add/Delete check box. Then, when you want to add or delete an anchor 
point, select the appropriate tool and click the path.
Additional tools to help you make paths
Some Pen tool modifiers are available in the Control panel in Illustrator CS4. 
You can take advantage of them to do many of the Pen tool functions, but 
using keyboard shortcuts to switch your Pen tool to its various options is 
probably still faster. Those who may be resistant to contorting your fingers 
while trying to create a path may appreciate these tools.
 
 In order to see the Control panel tools, select the Pen tool and start creating 
a path. Notice that the Control panel has a series of buttons available, as 
shown in Figure 5-10.

Using the Eraser tool
The Eraser tool is a tool all users will love! The Eraser tool allows you to 
quickly remove areas of artwork as easily as you erase pixels in Photoshop 
by stroking with your mouse over any shape or set of shapes.
New paths are automatically created along the edges of your erasure, even 
preserving the smoothness of your erasure as you see in Figure 5-11.

By double-clicking the Eraser tool, you can define the diameter, angle, and 
roundness of your eraser (see Figure 5-12). If you’re using a drawing tablet, 
you can even set Wacom tablet interaction parameters, such as Pressure 
and Tilt.
If you want to erase more than a single selected object, use Isolation Mode to 
segregate grouped objects for editing. Remember that to enter Isolation mode, 
you simply double-click a group of items. You can then use the eraser on all 
objects in that group at once without disturbing the rest of your design.

Tracing Artwork
You can use a template layer to trace an image manually. A template layer 
is a locked, dimmed layer that you can use to draw over placed images with 
the Pen tool, much like you’d do with a piece of onion skin paper over the 
top of an image.
Creating a template layer
Just follow these steps to create a template layer:
 
1. Take a scanned image or logo and save it in a format that Illustrator 
can import from your image-editing program, such as Photoshop.

Tracing Artwork
264
 
 Typically, you save the image as an .eps, .tif, or native .psd 
(Photoshop file).
 
2. Choose File➪Place to open the Place dialog box.
 
3. In the Place dialog box, locate the saved image; then select the 
Template check box and click Place.
 
 Note that the Template check box may be in a different location depending 
upon your platform, but it’s always located at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
 Selecting the Template check box tells Illustrator to lock down the 
scanned image on a layer. Essentially, you can’t reposition or edit your 
image.
 
 After you click Place, a template layer is automatically created for you, 
and another layer is waiting for you to create your path. The newly cre-
ated top layer is like a piece of tracing paper that’s been placed on top 
of the scanned image.
 
4. Re-create the image by tracing over it with the Pen tool.
 
5. When you’re done, turn the visibility off the placed image by clicking 
the Visibility icon to the left of the template layer.
 
 You now have a path that you can use in place of the image, which is 
useful if you’re creating an illustration of an image or are digitally re-
creating a logo.
For more about layers, check out Chapter 8 of this minibook.
 
Keep practicing to get more comfortable with clicking and dragging, flowing 
with the direction line pointing the way that you want the path to be 
created; everything will fall into place.
Using Live Trace
Use the Live Trace feature, introduced in Illustrator CS2, to automatically 
trace raster images into vector paths. This does work great in many 
instances, but is definitely not a “magic pill” for getting your images re-
created as vectors. For example, a logo with many precise curves and 
straight lines isn’t a good candidate for this feature, but a hand-drawn 
illustration, clip art, or other drawing works well.
Here are the steps that you take to use Live Trace:
 
1. Choose File➪Place and place a scan or raster illustration that you 
want to convert to vector paths.
 
2. Immediately after placing, you see that the Control panel now has 
some additional buttons available, as shown in Figure 5-13.

based upon default settings or, better yet, click and hold on the 
Tracing Options arrow and choose a more appropriate setting.
 
 Choose Tracing Options from the very bottom of the Tracing Options 
drop-down list to customize settings.
 
4. After you select the settings you’re happy with, you can either use the 
Live Paint features to color in the work or click the Expand button in 
the Control panel to expand the trace object to vector paths that can 
be edited.
 
 See Chapter 9 of this minibook for more information on painting fills and 
strokes.
Other Things You Should Know about Placing Images
In the preceding section, you discover how to place an image as a template. 
But what if you want to place an image to be utilized in your illustration file? 
Simply choose File➪Place.
Click once on an image to see the Link check box. If you keep the check 
box selected, the image is linked to the original file. This is good if you plan 
on referencing the file several times in the illustration (it saves file space) 
or if you want to edit the original and have it update the placed image in 
Illustrator. This option is usually checked by those in the prepress industry 
who want to have access to the original image file. Just remember to send 
the image with the Illustrator file if it’s to be outputted or used someplace 
other than on your computer.
If you deselect the Link check box, the image is embedded into the 
Illustrator file. This option does keep the filing system cleaner but doesn’t 
leave much room to edit the original image at a later point. There are cer-
tain instances, such as when you want an image to become a symbol (see 
Chapter 11 of this minibook), that the image will have to be embedded, but 
most functions work with linked and unlinked files.

Using Photoshop Layer Comps

Using Photoshop Layer Comps
Layer Comps are a feature in Photoshop that allow you to set the visibil-
ity, appearance, and position of layers. It’s a great organizational tool that 
you can now take advantage of in other Adobe products. Read more about 
Photoshop in Book IV.
You can place a .psd (Photoshop) image that’s saved Layer Comps from 
Photoshop and choose which layer comp set you want visible while placing 
in Adobe Illustrator CS4.

Chapter 6: Using Type 
in Illustrator
In This Chapter
✓ Introducing the Type tools
✓ Getting to know text areas
✓ Manipulating text along paths and within shapes
✓ Assigning font styles
✓ Discovering the Character, Control, and Paragraph panels
✓ Saving time with text utilities
O
ne of Illustrator’s strongest areas is manipulating text. Whether you’re 
using Illustrator to create logos, business cards, or type to be used on 
the Web, you have everything you need to create professional text.
In this chapter, you meet the Type tools and discover a few basic (and more 
advanced) text-editing tricks that you can take advantage of. You then find 
out about other text tools, such as the Character and Paragraph panels. At 
the end of this chapter, you get a quick-and-dirty lowdown on the Illustrator 
text utilities. These utilities can save you loads of time, so don’t skip this 
section.
Working with Type
You can do all sorts of cool things with type, from the simplest tasks of 
creating a line of text and dealing with text overflow to more complicated 
tricks, such as placing text along paths and wrapping text around objects.
Figure 6-1 shows the Type tools with an example of what you can do with 
each one. Click and hold the Type tool to see the hidden tools. The differ-
ent tools give you the ability to be creative and also accommodate foreign 
languages.

Working with Type
268
 
Figure 6-1: 
The Type 
tools.
 
Creating text areas
A text area is a region that you define. Text, when inserted in this region, is 
constrained within the shape. To create a text area, click and drag with the 
Type tool.
 
As you create and finish typing in a text area, you may want to quickly click 
and drag a new text area elsewhere on your artboard. Unfortunately, if 
you’re on the Type tool, Illustrator doesn’t allow you to do so. You have two 
options to address this problem:
 
✦ Choose Select➪Deselect and then create another area.
 
✦ Hold down the Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) key to temporarily access 
the Selection tool, and click. When you release the Ctrl (Windows) or Ô 
(Mac) key, you’ll still be on the Type tool, and you can then create a new 
text area.
Creating a line of text
To create a simple line of text, select the Type tool and click the artboard. 
A blinking insertion point appears. You can now start typing. With this 
method, the line of type goes on forever and ever (even beyond the end of 
the Scratch area) until you press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac) to start a 
new line of text. This excess length is fine if you just need short lines of text, 
say for callouts or captions, but it doesn’t work well if you’re creating a label 
or anything else that has large amounts of copy.
 
Many new users click and drag an ever-so-small text area that doesn’t allow 
room for even one letter. If you accidentally do this, switch to the Selection tool, 
delete the active type area, and then click to create a new text insertion point.

Book III
Chapter 6
Using Type 
in Illustrator

269
Flowing text into an area
Select the Type tool and then drag on the artboard to create a text area. 
The cursor appears in the text area; text you type automatically flows to the 
next line when it reaches the edge of the text area. You can also switch to 
the Selection tool and adjust the width and height of the text area with the 
handles.
 
Need an exact size for a text area? With the Type tool selected, drag to 
create a text area of any size. Then choose Window➪Transform to view the 
Transform panel. Type an exact width in the W text field and exact height in 
the H text field.
Dealing with text overflow
Watch out for excess text! If you create a text area that’s too small to hold 
all the text you want to put into it, a red plus sign appears in the lower-right 
corner, as shown in Figure 6-2.
When Illustrator indicates to you that you have too much text for the text 
area, you have several options:
 
Figure 6-2: 
The plus 
icon notes 
that text is 
overflowing.
 
Indicates text doesn't
ﬁt inside text area
 
✦ Make the text area larger by switching to the Selection tool and dragging 
the handles.
 
✦ Make the text smaller until you don’t see the overflow indicated.
 
✦ Link this text area to another, which is threading and is covered later in 
this chapter in the “Threading text into shapes” section.
Creating columns of text with the Area Type tool
The easiest and most practical way to create rows and columns of text is to 
use the area type options in Adobe Illustrator. This feature lets you create 
rows and columns from any text area. You can just have rows, or you can 
just have columns (much like columns of text in a newspaper), or even both.
 
1. Select the Type tool and drag on the artboard to create a text area.

Working with Type
270
 
2. Choose Type➪Area Type Options.
 
 The Area Type Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-3. At 
the end of this section, a list explains all the options in the Area Type 
Options dialog box.
 
Figure 6-3:
 The Area 
Type 
Options 
dialog box 
lets you 
create 
columns of 
text.
 
 
3. In the Area Type Options dialog box, enter the desired width and 
height in the Width and Height text fields.
 
 The Width and Height text fields contain the height and width of your 
entire text area. In Figure 6-3, 274.03 pt is in the Width text field and 
272.73 pt is in the Height text field.
 
4. In the Columns area, enter the number of columns you want to create 
in the Number text field, the span distance in the Span text field, and 
the gutter space in the Gutter text field.
 
 The span specifies the height of individual rows and the width of indi-
vidual columns. The gutter is the space between the columns and is auto-
matically set for you, but you can change it to any value you like.
 
5. Click OK.
When you create two or more columns of text with the Area Type Options 
dialog box, text flows to the next column when you reach the end of the pre-
vious column, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
The following is a breakdown of the other options available in the Area Type 
Options dialog box (refer to Figure 6-3):
 
✦ Width and Height: The present width and height of the entire text area.
 
✦ Number: The number of rows and/or columns that you want the text 
area to contain.

Book III
Chapter 6
Using Type 
in Illustrator
Working with Type
271
 
Figure 6-4: 
One column 
of text flows 
into the 
next.
 
 
✦ Span: The height of individual rows and the width of individual columns.
 
✦ Fixed: Determines what happens to the span of rows and columns if you 
resize the type area. When this check box is selected, resizing the area 
can change the number of rows and columns but not their width. Leave 
this option deselected if you want to resize the entire text area and have 
the columns automatically resize with it.
 
✦ Gutter: The empty space between rows or columns.
 
✦ Inset Spacing: The distance from the edges of the text area.
 
✦ First Baseline: Where you want the first line of text to appear. The 
Ascent option is the default and starts your text normally at the top. If 
you want to put a fixed size in, such as 50 pts from the top, select Fixed 
from the drop-down list and enter 50 pt in the Min text field.
 
✦ Text Flow: The direction in which you read the text as it flows to 
another row or column. You can choose to have the text flow horizon-
tally (across rows) or vertically (down columns).
Threading text into shapes
Create custom columns of text that are in different shapes and sizes by 
threading closed shapes together. This technique works with rectangles, 
circles, stars, or any closed shape and can lead to some creative text areas.
 
1. Create any shape, any size.
 
 For this example, we’ve created a circle.
 
2. Create another shape (it can be any shape) someplace else on the page.
 
3. With the Selection tool, select one shape and Shift-click the other to 
make just those two shapes active.
 
4. Choose Type➪Threaded Text➪Create.
 
 A threading line appears, as shown in Figure 6-5, indicating the direction 
of the threaded text.

Working with Type
272
 
Figure 6-5: 
Threaded 
text areas 
flow from 
one area to 
another.
 
 
5. Select the Type tool, click the top of the first shape to start the thread-
ing, and start typing.
 
 Continue typing until the text flows over into the other shape.
If you don’t want the text to be threaded anymore, choose Type➪Threaded 
Text➪Remove Threading, which eliminates all threading from the text 
shapes. To remove one or more shapes from the threading but not all the 
shapes, select the shape you want to remove from the threading and choose 
Type➪Threaded Text➪Release Selection.
Wrapping text
Wrapping text isn’t quite the same as wrapping a present — it’s easier! A text 
wrap forces text to wrap around a graphic, as shown in Figure 6-6. This fea-
ture can add a bit of creativity to any piece.
 
Figure 6-6: 
The graphic 
is forcing 
the text 
to wrap 
around it.
 
Follow these steps to wrap text around another object or group of objects:
 
1. Select the wrap object.
 
 This is the object that you want the text to wrap around.

Book III
Chapter 6
Using Type 
in Illustrator
Working with Type
273
 
2. Make sure that the wrap object is on top of the text you want to wrap 
around it by choosing Object➪Arrange➪Bring to Front.
 
 If you’re working in layers (which we discuss in Chapter 8 of this mini-
book), make sure that the wrap object is on the top layer.
 
3. Choose Object➪Text Wrap➪Make.
 
 An outline of the wrap area is visible.
 
4. Adjust the wrap area by choosing Object➪Text Wrap➪Text Wrap 
Options.
 
 The Text Wrap Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-7, 
giving you the following options:
 
• Offset: Specifies the amount of space between the text and the wrap 
object. You can enter a positive or negative value.
 
• Invert Wrap: Wraps the text on the inside of the wrap object instead 
of around it.
 
5. When you finish making your selections, click OK.
 
Figure 6-7: 
Adjust the 
distance 
of the text 
wrap from 
the object.
 
If you want to change the text wrap at a later point, select the object and 
choose Object➪Text Wrap➪Text Wrap Options. Make your changes and 
click OK.
If you want to unwrap text from an object, select the wrap object and choose 
Object➪Text Wrap➪Release.
Outlining text
Illustrator gives you the opportunity to change text into outlines or artwork. 
Basically, you change the text into an object, so you can no longer edit that 
text by typing. The plus side is that it saves you the trouble of sending fonts 
to everyone who wants to use the file. Turning text into outlines makes it 
appear as though your text was created with the Pen tool. You want to use 
this tool when creating logos that will be used frequently by other people or 
artwork that you may not have control over.

Working with Type
274
To turn text into an outline, follow these steps:
 
1. Type some text on your page.
 
 For this example, just type a word (say, your name) and make sure that 
the font size is at least 36 points. You want to have it large enough to see 
the effect of outlining it.
 
2. Switch to the Selection tool and choose Type➪Create Outlines.
 
 You can also use the keyboard command Ctrl+Shift+O (Windows) or 
Ô+Shift+O (Mac).
 
 The text is now grouped together in outline form.
 
3. If you’re being creative, or just particular, and want to move indi-
vidual letters, use the Group Select tool or choose Object➪Ungroup to 
separate the letters, as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
Figure 6-8: 
Letters 
converted to 
outlines.
 
 
When you convert type to outlines, the type loses its hints. Hints are the 
instructions built into fonts to adjust their shape so that your system dis-
plays or prints them in the best way based on the size. Without hints, let-
ters like lowercase e or a might fill in as the letter forms are reduced in 
size. Make sure that the text is the approximate size that it might be used at 
before creating outlines. Because the text loses the hints, try not to create 
outlines on text smaller than 10 pts.
Putting text on a path, in a closed shape, 
or on the path of a shape
Wow — that’s some heading, huh? You’ve probably seen text following a 
swirly path or inside some shape. Maybe you think accomplishing such a 
task is too intimidating to even attempt. In this section, we show you just 
how easy these things are! There are Type tools dedicated to putting type on 
a path or a shape (refer to Figure 6-1), but we think you’ll find that the key 
modifiers we show you in this section are easier to use.

Book III
Chapter 6
Using Type

275
Creating text on a path
Follow these steps to put type on a path:
 
1. Create a path with the Pen, Line, or Pencil tool.
 
 Don’t worry if it has a stroke or fill applied.
 
2. Select the Type tool and simply cross over the start of the path.
 
3. Look for an I-bar with a squiggle (which indicates that the text will run 
along the path) to appear and click.
 
 The stroke and fill of the path immediately change to None.
 
4. Start typing, and the text runs on the path.
 
5. Choose Window➪Type➪Paragraph and change the alignment in the 
Paragraph panel to reposition where the text falls on the path.
 
 Alternatively, switch to the Selection tool and drag the I-bar that 
appears, as shown in Figure 6-9, to move the text freehand. The path in 
Figure 6-9 was created with the Spiral tool, which is hidden in the Line 
Segment tool on the toolbar.
 
Flip the text to the other side of a path by clicking and dragging the I-bar 
under or over the path.
 
Figure 6-9: 
With the 
Selection 
tool, you 
can drag 
the I-bar to 
adjust the 
text.
 
Creating text in a closed shape
Putting text inside a shape can add spunk to a layout. This feature allows 
you to custom-create a closed shape with the shape tools or the Pen tool 
and flow text into it. Follow these steps to add text inside a shape:
 
1. Create a closed shape — a circle or oval, for example.
 
2. Select the Type tool and cross over the closed shape.

Working with Type
276
 
3. When you see the I-bar swell or become rounded, click inside the 
shape.
 
4. Start typing, and the text is contained inside the shape.
Text on the path of a closed shape
Perhaps you want text to run around the edge of a shape instead of inside it. 
Follow these steps to have text created on the path of a closed shape:
 
1. Create a closed shape, such as a circle.
 
2. Select the Type tool and cross over the path of the circle.
 
3. Don’t click when you see the I-bar swell up; hold down the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac) key instead.
 
 The icon now changes into the squiggle I-bar that you see when creating 
text on a path.
 
4. When the squiggle line appears, click.
 
5. Start typing, and the text flows around the path of the shape, as shown 
in Figure 6-10.
 
Figure 6-10: 
By holding 
down the 
Alt or Option 
key, you 
can flow 
text around 
a closed 
shape.
 
 
 To change the origin of the text or move it around, use the alignment 
options in the Paragraph panel or switch to the Selection tool and drag 
the I-bar to a new location on the path.
 
 You can drag the I-bar in and out of the shape to flip the text so that it 
appears on the outside or inside of the path.

Assigning Font Styles

Assigning Font Styles
After you have text on your page, you’ll often want to change it to be more 
interesting than the typical 12-pt Times font. Formatting text in Illustrator 
isn’t only simple, but you can do it multiple ways. In the following list, we 
name and define some basic type components (see Figure 6-11):
 
Figure 6-11: 
Components 
of type.
 
Kerning
Baseline
Baseline
Leading
Tracking
Font
x height
 
✦ Font: A complete set of characters, letters, and symbols of a particular 
typeface design.
 
✦ X height: The height of type, based on the height of the small x in that 
type family.
 
✦ Kerning: The space between two letters. Often used for letters in larger 
type that need to be pulled closer together, like “W i.” Kern a little to get 
the i to slide in a little closer to the W, maybe even going into the space 
that the W takes, as shown in Figure 6-12. Kerning doesn’t distort the 
text; it only increases or decreases the space between two letters.
 
✦ Leading: Space between the lines of text.
 
Figure 6-12: 
The letters 
before 
kerning (left) 
and after 
(right).

✦ Tracking: The space between multiple letters. Designers like to use this 
technique to spread out words by increasing the space between letters. 
Adjusting the tracking doesn’t distort text; it increases or decreases the 
space between the letters, as shown in Figure 6-13.

 Pretty good tracking and kerning has already been determined in most 
fonts. You don’t need to bother with these settings unless you’re tweaking 
the text for a more customized look.
 
✦ Baseline: The line that type sits on. The baseline doesn’t include 
descenders, type that extends down, like lowercase y and g. You adjust 
the baseline for trademark signs or mathematical formulas, as shown in 
Figure 6-14.

Using the Character Panel
To visualize changes that you’re making to text and to see characteristics 
that are already selected, choose Window➪Type➪Character or press Ctrl+T 
(Windows) or Ô+T (Mac), which brings up the Character panel. Click the 
triangle in the upper-right corner to see a panel menu of additional options. 
Choose Show Options, and additional type attributes appear, such as base-
line shift, underline, and strikethrough.
 
Pressing Ctrl+T (Windows) or Ô+T (Mac) is a toggle switch to either show or 
hide the Character panel. If you don’t see the Character panel appear at first, 
you may have hidden it by pressing the keyboard shortcut. Just try it again.
The following list explains the options in the Character panel (see Figure 6-15):
 
✦ Font: Pick the font that you want to use from this drop-down list.
 
 In the Windows version, you can click and drag across the font name in 
the Character panel or Control panel, and press the up- or down-arrow 
key to automatically switch to the next font above or below on the font 
list. Do this while you have text selected to see the text change live!
 
✦ Set font style: Pick the style (for example, Bold, Italic, or Bold Italic) 
from this drop-down list. The choices here are limited by the fonts that 
you have loaded. In other words, if you have only Times regular loaded 
in your system, you won’t have the choice to bold or italicize it.
 
✦ Type size: Choose the size of the type in this combo box. Average read-
able type is 12 pt; headlines can vary from 18 pts and up.
 
✦ Leading: Select how much space you want between the lines of text in 
this combo box. Illustrator uses the professional typesetting method of 

Using the Character Panel
280
including the type size in the total leading. In other words, if you have 
12 pt and want it double-spaced, set the leading at 24 pts.
 
✦ Kerning: Use this combo box by placing the cursor between two let-
ters. Increase the amount by clicking the up arrow or by typing a value 
to push the letters farther apart from each other; decrease the spacing 
between the letters by typing a lower value, even negative numbers, or 
by clicking the down arrow.
 
✦ Tracking: Use the Tracking combo box by selecting multiple letters and 
increasing or decreasing the space between them all at once by clicking 
the up or down arrows or by typing a positive or negative value.
 
✦ Horizontal scale: Distorts the selected text by stretching it horizontally. 
Enter a positive number to increase the size of the letters; enter a nega-
tive number to decrease the size.
 
✦ Vertical scale: Distorts the selected text vertically. Enter a positive 
number to increase the size of the letters; enter a negative number to 
decrease the size.
 
 Using horizontal or vertical scaling to make text look like condensed 
type often doesn’t give good results. When you distort text, the nice 
thick and thin characteristics of the typeface also become distorted and 
can produce weird effects.
 
✦ Baseline shift: Use baseline shift for trademark signs and mathematical 
formulas that require selected characters to be moved above or below 
the baseline.
 
✦ Character rotation: Rotate just the selected text by entering an angle in 
this text field or by clicking the up or down arrows.
 
✦ Rotate: Choose to rotate your selected text on any angle.
 
✦ Underline and strikethrough: These simple text attributes underline 
and strikethrough selected text.
 
✦ Language: Choose a language from this drop-down list. Note: The lan-
guage you specify here is used by Illustrator’s spell checker and hyphen-
ation feature. We discuss these features in the later section, “Text 
Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency.”

Using the Control Panel
Use the Control panel to quickly access your Type tools and Type panels. 
Note in Figure 6-16 that, when you have active text, hyperlinked text buttons 
allow you to quickly access panels, such as the Character and Paragraph 
panels. You can also use this Control panel as a quick and easy way to select 
fonts, size, alignment, color, and transparency.
 
Figure 6-16: 
The Control 
panel type 
functions.
 
Using the Paragraph Panel
Access the Paragraph panel quickly by clicking the Paragraph hyperlink in 
the Control panel or by choosing Window➪Type➪Paragraph. This panel has 
all the attributes that apply to an entire paragraph (such as alignment and 
indents, which we discuss in the next two sections, and hyphenation, which 
we discuss later in this chapter). For example, you can’t flush left one word 
in a paragraph — when you click the Flush Left button, the entire paragraph 
flushes left. To see additional options in the Paragraph panel, click the tri-
angle in the upper right of the panel (the panel menu) and choose Show 
Options.
Alignment
You can choose any of the following alignment methods by clicking the 
appropriate button on the Paragraph panel:
 
✦ Flush Left: All text is flush to the left with a ragged edge on the right. 
This is the most common way to align text.
 
✦ Center: All text is centered.
 
✦ Flush Right: All text is flush to the right and ragged on the left.
 
✦ Justify with the Last Line Aligned Left: Right and left edges are both 
straight, with the last line left-aligned.
 
✦ Justify with the Last Line Aligned Center: Right and left edges are both 
straight, with the last line centered.
 
✦ Justify with the Last Line Aligned Right: Right and left edges are both 
straight, with the last line right-aligned.

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
282
 
✦ Justify All Lines: This method is forced justification, where the last line is 
stretched the entire column width, no matter how short it is. This align-
ment is used in many publications, but it can create some awful results.
Indents
You can choose from the following methods of indentation:
 
✦ First Line Indent: Indents the first line of every paragraph. In other 
words, every time you press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac) key, 
this spacing is created.
 
 To avoid first-line indents and space after from occurring, say if you 
just want to break a line in a specific place, create a line break or a soft 
return by pressing Shift+Enter (Windows) or Shift+Return (Mac).
 
✦ Right Indent: Indents from the right side of the column of text.
 
✦ Left Indent: Indents from the left side of the column of text.
 
 Use the Eyedropper tool to copy the character, paragraph, fill, and stroke attri-
butes. Select the text that you want to, select the Eyedropper tool, and click 
once on the text with the attributes you want to apply to the selected text.
By default, the Eyedropper affects all attributes of a type selection, including 
appearance attributes. To customize the attributes affected by these tools, 
double-click the Eyedropper tool to open the Eyedropper dialog box.
Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
After you have text in an Illustrator document, you may need to perform 
various tasks within that text, such as searching for a word to replace with 
another word, checking your spelling and grammar, saving and creating your 
own styles, or changing the case of a block of text. You’re in luck because 
Illustrator provides various text utilities that enable you to easily and effi-
ciently perform all these otherwise tedious tasks. In the following sections, 
we give you a quick tour of these utilities.
Find and Replace
Generally, artwork created in Illustrator isn’t text heavy, but the fact that 
Illustrator has a Find and Replace feature can be a huge help. Use the Find 
and Replace dialog box (choose Edit➪Find and Replace) to search for words 
that need to be changed, such as changing Smyth to Smith, or to locate 
items that may be difficult to find otherwise. This feature works pretty much 
like all other search and replace methods.

Book III
Chapter 6
Using Type 
in Illustrator
Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
283
Spell checker
Can you believe there was a time when Illustrator didn’t have a spell checker? 
Thankfully, it does now — and its simple design makes it easy to use.
To use the spell checker, choose Edit➪Check Spelling and then click the 
Start button in the dialog box that appears. The spell checker works much 
like the spell checker in Microsoft Word or other popular applications: When 
a misspelled word is found, you’re offered a list of replacements. You can 
either choose to fix that instance, all instances, ignore the misspelling, or 
add your word to the dictionary.
If you click the arrow to the left of Options, you can set other specifications, 
such as whether you want to look for letter case issues or have the spell 
checker note repeated words.
Note: The spell checker uses whatever language you specify in the Character 
panel. We discuss this panel in the earlier section, “Using the Character 
Panel.”
 
If you work in a specialized industry that uses loads of custom words, save 
yourself time by choosing Edit➪Edit Custom Dictionary and then add your 
own words. We recommend that you do so before you’re ready to spell 
check a document so that the spell checker doesn’t flag the custom words 
later (which slows you down).
The Hyphenation feature
Nothing is worse than severely hyphenated copy. Most designers either use 
hyphenation as little as possible or avoid it altogether by turning off the 
Hyphenation feature.
Here are a few things that you should know about customizing your hyphen-
ation settings if you decide to use this feature:
 
✦ Turning on/off the Hyphenation feature: Activate or deactivate the fea-
ture in the Hyphenation dialog box (see Figure 6-17); access this dialog 
box by choosing Window➪Type➪Paragraph, clicking the arrow in the 
upper right of the Paragraph panel to access the panel menu, and then 
choosing Hyphenation from the list of options that appears. If you won’t 
use the Hyphenation feature, turn it off by deselecting the Hyphenation 
check box at the top of the Hyphenation dialog box.
 
 You can also simply click the Paragraph hyperlink in the Control panel 
to access the Paragraph panel.

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
284
 
✦ Setting specifications in the Hyphenation dialog box: Set specifica-
tions in the dialog box that determine the length of words to hyphenate, 
how many hyphens should be used in a single document, whether to 
hyphenate capitalized words, and how words should be hyphenated. 
The Before Last setting is useful, for example, if you don’t want to have a 
word, such as liquidated hyphenated as liquidat-ed. Type 3 in the Before 
Last text field, and Illustrator won’t hyphenate words if it leaves only 
two letters on the next line.
 
✦ Setting the Hyphenation Limit and Hyphenation Zone: They’re not 
diets or worlds in another dimension. The Hyphenation Limit setting 
enables you to limit the number of hyphens in a row. So, for example, 
type 2 in the Hyphenation Limit text field so that there are never more 
than two hyphenated words in a row. The Hyphenation Zone text field 
enables you to set up an area of hyphenation based upon a measure-
ment. For example, you can specify 1 inch to allow for only one hyphen-
ation every inch. You can also use the slider to determine whether you 
want better spacing or fewer hyphens. This slider works only with the 
Single-Line Composer (the default).

Customizing 
hyphenation 
settings.
 
The Find Font feature
If you work in production, you’ll love the Find Font feature, which enables 
you to list all the fonts in a file that contains text and then search for and 
replace fonts (including the font’s type style) by name. You do so from the 
Find Font dialog box (see Figure 6-18), accessed by choosing Type➪Find 
Font. Select the font that you want to replace from the Fonts in Document 
list. Next, select a font from the Replace with Font From list. Note that the 
font must already appear in the document. Click the Change button to 
replace the font (or click the Change All button to replace all instances of the 
font) and then click OK. That’s it!

Book III
Chapter 6

This cool feature enables you to replace fonts with fonts from the current 
working document or from your entire system. Select System from the 
Replace with Font From drop-down list to choose from all the fonts loaded in 
your system.
 
Figure 6-18: 
Use the Find 
Font dialog 
box to find

The Change Case feature
Doesn’t it drive you crazy when you type an entire paragraph before 
discovering that you somehow pressed the Caps Lock key? Fix it fast by 
selecting the text, choosing Type➪Change Case, and then choosing one of 
the following:
 
✦ Uppercase: Makes the selected text all uppercase.
 
✦ Lowercase: Makes the selected text all lowercase.
 
✦ Title Case: Capitalizes the first letter in each word.
 
✦ Sentence Case: Capitalizes just the first letter in the selected 
sentence(s).
In Illustrator CS4, you use the same type engine used by InDesign for high-
quality text control. As a default, you’re working in what is referred to 
as Single-Line Composer. Select Single or Every Line composer from the 
Paragraph panel menu.

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
286
The different options include
 
✦ Single-Line Composer: Useful if you prefer to have manual control over 
how lines break. In fact, this method had been in place in the past. The 
Single-Line Composer option doesn’t take the entire paragraph into con-
sideration when expanding letter space and word spacing, so justified 
text can sometimes look odd in its entire form (see Figure 6-19).
 
✦ Every-Line Composer: The Every-Line Composer option is a very pro-
fessional way of setting text; many factors are taken into account as far 
as spacing is concerned, and spacing is based on the entire paragraph. 
With this method, you see few spacing issues that create strange effects, 
such as the ones on the left of Figure 6-19.

Single-Line 
Composer 
(left) and 
Every-Line 
Composer

Text styles
A text style is a saved set of text attributes, such as font, size, and so on. 
Creating text styles keeps you consistent and saves you time by enabling 
you to efficiently implement changes in one step instead of having to select 
the text attributes for each instance of that style of text (say a heading or 
caption). So when you’re finally happy with the way your headlines appear 
and how the body copy looks or when your boss asks whether the body 
copy can be a smidgen smaller (okay . . . how much is a smidgen?), you can 
confidently answer, “Sure!”
If you’ve created styles, changing a text attribute is simple. What’s more, the 
change is applied at once to all text that uses that style. Otherwise, you’d 
have to make the attribute change to every occurrence of body text, which 
could take a long time if your text is spread out.
Illustrator offers two types of text styles:
 
✦ Character styles: Saves attributes for individual selected text. If you 
want just the word “New” in a line of text to be red 20 pt Arial, you can 
save it as a character style. Then, when you apply it, the attributes apply 
only to the selected text (and not the entire line or paragraph).

Book III
Chapter 6
Using Type 
in Illustrator
Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
287
 
✦ Paragraph styles: Saves attributes for an entire paragraph. A span of 
text is considered a paragraph until it reaches a hard return or para-
graph break. Note that pressing Shift+Enter (Windows) or Shift+Return 
(Mac) is considered a soft return, and paragraph styles will continue to 
apply beyond the soft return.
You can create character and paragraph styles in many ways, but we show 
you the easiest and most direct methods in the following subsections.
Creating character styles
Create a character style when you want individual sections of text to be 
treated differently from other text in the paragraph. So instead of manually 
applying a style over and over again, you create and implement a character 
style. To do so, open a document containing text and follow these steps:
 
1. Set up text with the text attributes you want included in the char-
acter style in the Character and Paragraph panels and then choose 
Window➪Type➪Character Styles.
 
 The Character Styles panel opens.
 
 2. Select the text from Step 1 and Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click 
(Mac) the New Style button (the dog-eared page icon) at the bottom of 
the Character Styles panel.
 
3. In the Character Styles Options dialog box that appears, name your 
style and click OK.
 
 Illustrator records what attributes have been applied already to the 
selected text and builds a style from them.
 
4. Create another text area by choosing Select➪Deselect and using the 
Type tool to drag out a new text area.
 
 We discuss using the Type tool in the earlier section, “Creating text 
areas.”
 
5. Change the font and size to something dramatically different from 
your saved style and type some text.
 
6. Select some (not all) of the new text and then Alt-click (Windows) or 
Option-click (Mac) the style name in the Character Styles panel.
 
 Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) to eliminate any attributes 
that weren’t part of the saved style. The attributes of the saved charac-
ter style are applied to the selected text.
 
When creating a new panel item (any panel) in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, 
or Photoshop, we recommend that you get in the habit of Alt-clicking 
(Windows) or Option-clicking (Mac) the New Style button. This habit allows 

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
288
you to name the item (style, layer, swatch, and so on) while adding it to the 
panel.
Creating a paragraph style
Paragraph styles include attributes that are applied to an entire paragraph. 
What constitutes a paragraph is all text that falls before a hard return (you 
create a hard return when you press Enter [Windows] or Return [Mac]), 
so this could be one line of text for a headline or ten lines in a body text 
paragraph.
To create a paragraph style, open a document that contains text or open a 
new document and add text to it; then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Type➪Paragraph Styles to open the Paragraph 
Styles panel.
 
2. Find a paragraph of text that has the same text attributes throughout it 
and put your cursor anywhere in that paragraph.
 
 You don’t even have to select the whole paragraph!
 
3. Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) the Create New Style button 
(the dog-eared icon at the bottom of the Paragraph panel) to create a 
new paragraph style; give your new style a name.
 
 Your new style now appears in the Paragraph Styles panel list of styles.
 
4. Create a paragraph of text elsewhere in your document and make its 
attributes different from the text in Step 2.
 
5. Put your cursor anywhere in the new paragraph and Alt-click 
(Windows) or Option-click (Mac) your named style in the Paragraph 
Styles panel.
 
 The attributes from the style are applied to the entire paragraph.
Updating styles
When you use existing text to build styles, reselect the text and assign the 
style. In other words, if you put the cursor in the original text whose attri-
butes were saved as a style, it doesn’t have a style assigned to it in the Styles 
panel. Assign the style by selecting the text or paragraph and clicking the 
appropriate style listed in the Styles panel. By doing so, you ensure that any 
future updates to that style will apply to that original text, as well as to all 
other instances.
To update a style, simply select its name in either the Character or 
Paragraph Styles panel. Choose Options from the panel menu, which you 
access by clicking the arrow in the upper-right corner of the panel. In the 

Book III
Chapter 6
Using Type 
in Illustrator

289
resulting dialog box (see Figure 6-20), make changes by clicking the main 
attribute on the left and then updating the choices on the right. After you do 
so, all tagged styles are updated.
 
Figure 6-20: 
Updating a 
paragraph 
style.
 
 
Documents created in older versions of Adobe Illustrator (Version 10 or 
earlier) contain legacy text, which is text using the older text engine. When 
these files are opened, you see a warning dialog box, such as the one you see 
in Figure 6-21.
 
Figure 6-21: 
Legacy text 
warning; 
click OK, not 
Update!
 
If you click the Update button, any text on the document will most likely 
reflow, causing line breaks, leading, and other spacing to change.
Click the OK button to update the file after it’s opened to lock down the text. 
If necessary, you can use the Type tool to click a selected text area to update 
only the contained text. Another Warning dialog box appears that gives you 
the opportunity to update the selected text, copy the text object, or cancel 
the text tool selection. This method is the best way to see what changes 
are occurring so that you can catch any spacing issues right off the bat. See 
Figure 6-22 for samples of the three options in the warning dialog box.

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
290
 
If you click Copy the Text Object, you can use the underlying locked copy to 
adjust the new text flow to match the old. Throw away the legacy text layer 
by clicking and dragging it to the trash icon in the Layers panel, or click the 
visibility eye icon to the left of the Legacy Text layer to hide it when you’re 
finished.

In This Chapter
✓ Using your rulers
✓ Using ruler and custom guides
✓ Working with the Transform panel for placement
✓ Changing ruler origin
✓ Rearranging, hiding, and locking objects
✓ Masking objects
You can know all the neat special effects in Illustrator, but if you don’t 
have strong organization skills, you can become exasperated when 
things just don’t work as you expect them to. In this chapter, we focus on a 
few organizational tricks of the trade.
Setting Ruler Increments
Using rulers to help you accurately place objects in your illustration sounds 
pretty simple (and it is), but not knowing how to effectively use the rulers in 
Illustrator can drive you over the edge.
To view rulers in Illustrator, choose View➪Show Rulers or press Ctrl+R 
(Windows) or Ô+R (Mac). When the rulers appear, they’re in the default set-
ting of points (or whatever measurement increment was last set up in the 
preferences).
You can change the rulers’ increments to the measurement system that you 
prefer in the following ways:
 
✦ Create a new document and select your preferred measurement units in 
the New Document dialog box.
 
✦ Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the horizontal or vertical 
ruler and pick a measurement increment.
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Units and Display Performance (Windows) 
or Illustrator➪Preferences➪Units and Display Performance (Mac) to 
bring up the Preferences dialog box.

Using Guides
292
 
 Be very careful with the Preferences dialog box. Change ruler units only 
by using the General tab of the Preferences dialog box. If you change the 
units of measurement in the Stroke and Type tabs, you can end up with 
12-inch type instead of that dainty 12-point type you were expecting! 
Remember: Setting the General Preferences changes the preferences for 
all future documents.
 
✦ Choose File➪Document Setup to change measurement units for only the 
document that you’re working on.
Using Guides
Guides can make producing accurate illustrations much easier, and they can 
even go away when you’re done with them. You can use two kinds of guides 
in Illustrator:
 
✦ Ruler guides: Straight-line guides that are created by clicking the ruler 
and dragging out to the artboard.
 
✦ Custom guides: Guides created from Illustrator objects, such as shapes 
or paths. Great for copying the exact angle of a path and replicating it, 
as shown in Figure 7-1.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Turn your 
selected 
paths and 
shapes into 
custom 
guides.
 
Creating a ruler guide
A ruler guide is the easiest guide to create. Click anywhere on the vertical or 
horizontal ruler and drag it to the artboard to create a ruler guide, as shown 
in Figure 7-2. By default, the horizontal ruler creates horizontal guides (no 
kidding), and the vertical ruler creates vertical guides. You can Alt+drag 
(Windows) or Option+drag (Mac) to change the orientation of the guide. The 
vertical ruler then creates a horizontal guide, and the horizontal ruler then 
creates a vertical guide.

Figure 7-2:

Creating a custom guide
Create a custom guide by selecting a path or a shape and choosing 
View➪Guides➪Make Guides. Whatever is selected turns into a non-
printing guide. Changing a path into a guide isn’t permanent. Choose 
View➪Guides➪Release Guides to turn guides back into paths.
Using the Transform Panel for Placement
Placing shapes and paths precisely where you want them can be difficult for 
those with even the steadiest of hands. Save yourself aggravation by using 
the Transform panel to perform such tasks as scaling and rotating objects. 
On a more practical note, however, the Transform panel also enables you 
to type in x, y coordinates. This way, you can position your objects exactly 
where you want them.
 
In Adobe Illustrator and InDesign, the Reference Point Indicator icon is on 
the left side of the Transform panel. Click the handle of the Reference Point 
Indicator icon to change the point of reference. If you want to measure from 
the upper-left corner, click the indicator on the handle in the upper left. 
Want to know exactly where the center of an object is? Click the center point 
in the indicator. The point of reference is the spot on the object that falls at 
the x, y coordinates:
 
✦ X coordinate: Sets the placement of the selected object from left to 
right.
 
✦ Y coordinate: Sets the placement of the selected object from top to 
bottom.
 
Did you ever notice that Adobe Illustrator, which is based on PostScript, 
considers the lower-left corner the zero point? This can be confusing at first. 
You can change the ruler origin if it really drives you crazy by following the 
steps in the next section.

Changing the Ruler Origin
294
Changing the Ruler Origin
 
In Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop, you can change your ruler 
origin. This action helps define your measuring starting point and defines the 
part of the page that will print if you use manual tiling.
To change the ruler origin, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the pointer to the upper-left corner of the rulers where the 
rulers intersect, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Drag where 
rulers 
intersect 
to change 
the ruler’s 
origin.
 
 
2. Drag the pointer to where you want the new ruler origin.
 
 While you drag, a cross hair in the window and in the rulers indicates 
where the new ruler origin will be placed.
You can put the original ruler origin back in place by double-clicking the 
ruler intersection.
Thinking about Object Arrangement
Just like stacking paper on your desk, new objects in Illustrator are 
placed on top of the existing objects. Change this order by choosing the 
Object➪Arrange choices.
The easiest choices are to bring an object to the front or send it to the back. 
The results of sending forward or backward can be a little unnerving if you 
don’t know exactly in what order objects were created. Figure 7-4 shows an 
illustration that we rearranged with four of the available choices. Figure 7-5 
shows the result of each choice.

To change the stacking order, select the object(s) whose placement you 
want to change and then choose one of the following:
 
✦ Object➪Arrange➪Bring to Front: Brings the selected object(s) to the 
top of the painting order. In Figure 7-5a, the square is brought in front by 
using the Bring to Front command.
 
✦ Object➪Arrange➪Bring Forward: Brings the selected object(s) in front 
of the object created just before it, or one level closer to the front. In 
Figure 7-5b, the circle is pulled up in front of the square with the Bring 
Forward command.
 
✦ Object➪Arrange➪Send Backward: Moves the selected object(s) so that 
it falls under the object created just before it, or one level further to the 
back. In Figure 7-5c, the triangle is sent backward so that it’s just under 
the circle.
 
✦ Object➪Arrange➪Send to Back: Pushes the selected object(s) to the 
bottom of the painting order. In Figure 7-5d, the triangle is placed on the 
bottom with the Send to Back command.

Hiding Objects
Seasoned Illustrator users love the Hide command. Use it when the object 
that you want to select is stuck behind something else, or when you need to 
select one object and another keeps activating instead.

Hiding Objects
296
A good opportunity to use the Hide command is when you’re creating text 
inside a shape. In Chapter 6 of this minibook, we show you that as soon 
as you turn a shape into a text area, the fill and stroke attributes turn into 
None. Follow these steps to hide a shape:
 
1. Create a shape.
 
 For this example, we created an ellipse.
 
2. Click the Fill color box at the bottom of the Illustrator toolbox and 
then choose Window➪Swatches.
 
 The Swatches panel appears.
 
3. In the Swatches panel, choose a color for the fill.
 
 In this example, yellow is selected. The stroke doesn’t matter; this one is 
set it to None.
 
 When you click a shape with the Type tool, it converts your shape into 
a text area, and the fill and stroke convert to None. To have a colored 
shape remain, you must hide a copy.
 
4. With your colored shape selected, choose Edit➪Copy; alternatively, 
you can press Ctrl+C (Windows) or Ô+C (Mac).
 
 This makes a copy of your shape.
 
5. Choose Edit➪Paste in Back or press Ctrl+B (Windows) or Ô+B (Mac).
 
 This step puts a copy of your shape exactly in back of the original.
 
6. Choose Object➪Hide or press Ctrl+3 (Windows) or Ô+3 (Mac).
 
 The copy of the shape is now hidden; what you see is your original shape.
 
7. Switch to the Type tool by selecting the tool in the toolbox or pressing T.
 
8. With the cursor, cross over the edge of the shape to change it to the 
Area Type tool.
 
 The Area Type tool enables you to type into a shape.
 
9. When you see the type insertion cursor swell up (as shown in Figure 7-6), 
click the edge of the shape.
 
 The insertion point is now blinking inside the shape, and the fill and 
stroke attributes of the shape have been changed to None.

10. Type some text (see Figure 7-7).
 
Figure 7-7: 
Type 
directly into 
the shape.
 
 
11. When you’re finished entering text, choose Object➪Show All, or press 
Ctrl+Alt+3 (Windows) or Ô+Option+3 (Mac).
 
 Your colored shape reappears with the text in the middle of it (see 
Figure 7-8).
 
Figure 7-8: 
The hidden 
shape 
reappears 
behind the 
text.
 
Use the Hide command anytime you want to tuck away something for later 
use. We promise that anything hidden in Illustrator won’t be lost. Just use 
the Show All command, and any hidden objects are revealed, exactly where 
you left them. Too bad the Show All command can’t reveal where you left 
your car keys!
Locking Objects
Locking items is handy when you’re building an illustration. Not only does 
the Lock command lock down objects that you don’t want to make changes 
to, but it also drives anyone who tries to edit your files crazy! In fact, we 
mention locking mainly to help preserve your sanity. There will be many 
times you need to make simple adjustments to another designer’s artwork 
and you just can’t, unless the objects are first unlocked. You can lock and 
unlock objects as follows:

Creating a Clipping Mask
298
 
✦ Lock an object: Choose Object➪Lock or press Ctrl+2 (Windows) or Ô+2 
(Mac) to lock an object so that you can’t select it, move it, or change its 
attributes.
 
✦ Unlock an object: Choose Object➪Unlock All or press Ctrl+Alt+2 
(Windows) or Ô+Option+2 (Mac). Then you can make changes to it.
You can also lock and hide objects with layers. See Chapter 8 in this mini-
book for more information about using layers.
Creating a Clipping Mask
Creating a clipping mask may sound complex, but it’s actually easy and brings 
together some of the items that we talk about in this chapter, such as arrang-
ing objects. A clipping mask allows a topmost object to define the selected 
shapes underneath it. It’s similar to you cutting a hole in a piece of paper and 
peering through it to the objects below, except that with a clipping mask, the 
area around the defining shape is transparent (see Figure 7-9).
 
Figure 7-9: 
Examples of 
items with 
the clipping 
mask 
feature.
 
You may remember what a film mask looks like — it’s black to block out the 
picture and clear where you want to view an image, as shown in Figure 7-10.

Chapter 7

Illustrations
Creating a Clipping Mask
299
 
Figure 7-10: 
An 
illustration 
of a con-
ventional 
film mask.
 
The clipping mask feature uses the same principal as the conventional film 
mask, but the clipping mask is a whole lot easier to create and modify. To 
create a clipping mask, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Place to place an image.
 
 Masks work with objects created in Illustrator, as well as those placed 
(scanned or otherwise imported into Illustrator), but an example using a 
single placed image is less complicated.
 
2. Create the item that you want to use as a mask by creating a shape or 
a closed path with the Pen tool.
 
 For example, in Figure 7-11, the circle is the mask. (The photo under-
neath it is the placed image from Step 1.) The circle is placed where the 
mask will be created. It doesn’t matter what the shape’s color, fill, and 
stroke are because these automatically change to None when you create 
a mask.
 
 Note: When creating a clipping mask, make sure that the object to be 
used as a mask is a closed shape and is at the top of the stacking order.
 
3. With the Selection tool, select the placed image and the shape.
 
 Shift-click to add an object to the selection.
 
Figure 7-11: 
Position the 
mask shape 
over the

4. Choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make.
 
 Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+7 (Windows) or 
Ô+7 (Mac) to create the clipping mask.
 
 Ta-da! The clipping mask is created. The masked items are grouped 
together, but you can use the Direct Selection tool to move around the 
image or the mask individually.
 
5. To turn off the clipping mask, choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Release.
 
You can also use text as a clipping mask. Just type a word, make sure that 
it’s positioned over an image or other Illustrator object(s), select both the 
text and the object, and then choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make.

Chapter 8: Using Layers
In This Chapter
✓ Working with layers
✓ Using layers for a selection
✓ Changing the stacking order of your layer
✓ Moving and cloning objects to another layer
✓ Hiding and locking layers
T
his chapter shows you just how simple it is to use layers and how helpful 
layers can be when you’re producing complex artwork. Layers are similar 
to clear pages stacked on top of your artwork: You can place content (text, 
shapes, and so on) on a layer, lift up a layer, remove a layer, hide and show 
layers, or lock a layer so that you can’t edit the content on it. Layers are an 
incredible feature that can help you
 
✦ Organize the painting (stacking) order of objects.
 
✦ Activate objects that would otherwise be difficult to select with the 
Selection or Direct Selection tool.
 
✦ Lock items that you don’t want to reposition or change.
 
✦ Hide items until you need them.
 
✦ Repurpose objects for artwork variations. For example, business cards 
use the same logo and company address, but the name and contact 
information change for each person. In this case, placing the logo and 
company address on one layer and the person’s name and contact infor-
mation on another layer makes it easy to create a new business card by 
just changing the name of the person.
Many Illustrator users don’t take advantage of layers. Maybe these users 
don’t understand the basic functions of layers, or maybe they think that 
layers are much more complicated than they really are. By reading this 
chapter, you’ll be able to take advantage of layers in Illustrator.
 
Unlike in Photoshop, layers in Illustrator don’t add an incredible amount of 
size to the file.

Creating New Layers
302
Creating New Layers
When you create a new Illustrator document, you automatically have one 
layer to start with. To understand how layers work, create a new file and 
then follow these steps to create new layers and put objects on them:
 
1. If the Layers panel isn’t already visible, choose Window➪Layers.
 
 The Layers panel appears. In Illustrator CS4, you see layer color bars 
to help identify selected objects and the layer they’re on, as shown in 
Figure 8-1.
 
 In Figure 8-1, the Notes layer name is in italic. This is because the cre-
ator double-clicked that layer (to open the Layer Options dialog box) 
and deselected the Print check box.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The Layers 
panel.
 
 
2. Create a shape anywhere on the artboard.
 
 The size of the shape doesn’t matter, but make sure that it has a colored 
fill so that you can see it easily. For example, create a rectangle.
 
3. Click the Fill button in the Control panel and select any color for the 
shape from the Color Picker that appears, as shown in Figure 8-2.
 
 The Fill button is the swatch with an arrow on the left side of the Control 
panel.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Select any 
color from 
the Fill Color 
Picker.
 

Book III
Chapter 8
Using Layers
Creating New Layers
303
 
 The blue handle color that appears on the active shape matches the 
blue-color bar you see in the Layers panel on the left side of the layer 
name and the small selection square to the right of the radio button. The 
small selection square on the right disappears if you choose Select➪
Deselect. You use that square to see what layer a selected object is on.
 
 Also, notice now that you’ve added a shape to this layer, and an arrow 
appears to the left of the layer name. This arrow indicates that you 
now have a sublayer, which is essentially a layer within a layer. Click 
the arrow to expand the layer and show any sublayers nested under it; 
sublayers are automatically created when you add objects, which helps 
when you’re making difficult selections.
 
4. Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) the Create New Layer button 
at the bottom of the Layers panel to create a new layer.
 
 The Layer Options dialog box appears (see Figure 8-3), and you can use 
it to name a layer and change the selection color. You don’t have to hold 
down the Alt or Option key when making a new layer, but if you don’t, 
you won’t have the opportunity to name the layer when you create it.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Creating a 
new layer.
 
 
5. Enter a name for the new layer in the Name text box and click OK.
 
 In Figure 8-3, we entered circle because it’s the shape that we add in the 
next step.
 
 A new layer is added to the top of the stack in the Layers panel.
 
6. Make a shape on the new layer and overlap the shape you created in 
Step 2 (see Figure 8-4).
 
 We created a circle, as shown in Figure 8-4.
 
7. Change the fill color for your new shape.
 
 Check out the selection handles: They change to a different color, indi-
cating that you’re on a different layer. The different colors of the handles 
are for organizational purposes only and don’t print.

8. Just to be different, this time choose New Layer from the panel menu.
 
 The Layer Options dialog box appears.
 
9. (Optional) In the Layer Options dialog box, change the color of the 
selection handles by selecting an option from the Color drop-down list.
 
 You can also hide or lock the contents of the layer.
 
10. Enter a name for this new layer in the Name text field, click OK, and 
then create a shape on it.
 
 For example, we entered star in the Name text box and used the Star 
tool to create a star on the new layer.
 
11. Again, change the fill color of your newest shape so that it’s different 
from the other shapes.
 
12. Use the Selection tool to move the new shape so that it overlaps the 
others slightly.
 
13. Rename the original layer (Layer 1) by double-clicking the layer’s 
name in the Layers panel, typing a new name, and then pressing Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac).
 
 Because we had a rectangle on Layer 1, we typed rectangle (that’s nice 
and descriptive) to rename the layer.
 
You can open up the Options dialog box for any existing layer by choosing 
Options for Layer (Named Layer) from the panel menu in the Layers panel.
You’ve created new layers and now have a file that you can use to practice 
working with layers.

Book III
Chapter 8
Using Layers
Moving and Cloning Objects
305
Using Layers for Selections
When you have a selected object on a layer, a color selection square appears to 
the right of the named layer. If you click the radio button directly to the right 
of the layer’s name in the Layers panel, all objects are selected on that layer.
Sublayers each have their own radio button as well. If you have sublayers 
visible, you can use this same technique to select objects that may be buried 
behind others.
 
If you think that you’ll be selecting sublayers frequently, double-click the 
default name and type a more descriptive name for that layer.
Changing the Layer Stacking Order
In Chapter 7 of this minibook, we tell you about the Object➪Arrange feature 
in Illustrator; with layers, this process gets just a little more complicated. 
Each layer has its own painting order, the order in which you see the layers. 
To move a layer (and thereby change the stacking order of the layers), click 
and drag that layer until you see the black insertion line where you want the 
layer to be moved.
As you add shapes to a layer, a sublayer is created, and it has its own little 
stacking order that’s separate from other layers. In other words, if you 
choose to send an object to the back and it’s on the top layer, it will only 
go to the back of that layer, and still be in front of any objects on layers 
beneath.
 
Understanding how the stacking order affects the illustration is probably 
the most confusing part about layers. Just remember that for an object to 
appear behind everything else, it has to be on the bottom layer (and at the 
bottom of all the objects in that bottom layer); for an object to appear in 
front of everything else, it has to be on the topmost layer.
Moving and Cloning Objects
To move a selected object from one layer to another, click the small color 
selection square to the right of the layer’s radio button in the Layers panel, 
drag it to the target layer, and release. That’s all there is to moving an object 
from one layer to another.

Hiding Layers
306
You can also clone an item — that is, make a copy of it while you move 
the copy to another layer. Clone an object by Alt+dragging (Windows) or 
Option+dragging (Mac) the color selection square to another layer. A plus 
sign appears while you drag (so you know that you’re making a clone of the 
object). Release when you get to the cloned object’s target layer.
 
Choose Paste Remembers Layers from the Layers panel to have Illustrator 
automatically remember which layer you copied an object from. No matter 
which layer is active, Illustrator will always paste the object back on the 
original layer that it was copied from.
Hiding Layers
To the left of each layer in the Layers panel is an eye icon. This is a visibility 
toggle button. Simply clicking the eye icon hides the layer (the eye disap-
pears, denoting that this layer is hidden). Click the empty square (where the 
eye icon was) to show the layer again.
Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) an eye icon to hide all layers 
except the one you click; Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) on the 
eye icon to show all the layers again.
Ctrl-click (Windows) or Ô-click (Mac) the eye icon to turn just the selected 
layer into Outline view mode. In Outline view, all you see are the outlines 
of the artwork with no stroke widths or fill colors. The rest of your artwork 
remains in Preview mode, with strokes and fills visible. This technique is 
pretty tricky and helpful when you’re looking for stray points or need to 
close paths. Ctrl-click (Windows) or Ô-click (Mac) back on the eye icon to 
return the layer to Preview mode.
Locking Layers
Lock layers by clicking the empty square to the right of the Visibility (eye) 
icon. A padlock icon appears so that you know the layer is now locked. 
Locking a layer prevents you from making changes to the objects on that 
layer. Click the padlock to unlock the layer.

his chapter is all about making your brilliant illustrations come alive 
with color. Here, we show you how to create new and edit existing 
colors, save custom colors that you create, create and use patterns and gra-
dients, and even apply color attributes to many different shapes.
Choosing a Color Mode
Every time that you create a new file, you choose a profile. This profile 
determines, among other things, which color mode your document will be 
created in. Typically, anything related to Web, mobile, and video is in RGB 
mode, and the print profile is in CMYK. You can also simply choose Basic 
CMYK or Basic RGB. Here are the differences between the color modes:
 
✦ Basic CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black): This mode is used if 
you’re taking your illustration to a professional printer and the files will 
be separated into cyan, magenta, yellow, and black plates for printing.
 
✦ Basic RGB (Red, Green, Blue): Use this mode if your final destination 
is the Web, mobile device, video, color copier or desktop printer, or 
screen presentation.
The decision that you make affects the premade swatches, brushes, styles, 
and a slew of other choices in Adobe Illustrator. This all helps you to avoid 
sending an RGB color to a print shop. Ever see how that turns out? If your 

Using the Swatches Panel
308
prepress person doesn’t catch that the file isn’t CMYK and sends an RGB file 
as separations (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to a printer, you can end 
up with a black blob instead of your beautiful illustration.
 
You can change the color mode at any time without losing information by 
choosing File➪Document Color Mode.
Using the Swatches Panel
Accessing color from the Control panel is probably the easiest way to make 
color choices, as using the Fill and Stroke drop-down lists allow you to 
quickly access the Swatches panel, as shown in Figure 9-1, and at the same 
time, make sure that the color is actually applying to either the fill or stroke. 
How many times have you mixed up colors and assigned the stroke color to 
the fill or vice versa?
You can also access the Swatches panel, which you open by choosing 
Window➪Swatches. Although limited in choice, its basic colors, patterns, 
and gradients are ready to go. You can use the buttons at the bottom of 
the Swatches panel (as shown in Figure 9-1) to quickly open color librar-
ies, select what kinds of colors to view, access swatch options, create color 
groups, add new swatches, and delete selected swatches.
You may notice some odd color swatches — for example, the cross hair and 
the diagonal line.

The cross hair represents the Registration color. Only use this swatch when 
creating custom crop marks or printer marks. The Registration color looks 
black, but it’s actually created from 100 percent of all colors. This way, when 
artwork is separated, the crop mark appears on all color separations.
 
 
The diagonal line represents None. Use this option if you want no fill or 
stroke.
Applying Color to the Fill and Stroke
Illustrator objects are created from fills (the inside) and strokes (border or path). 
Look at the bottom of the toolbox for the Fill and Stroke color boxes. If you’re 
applying color to the fill, the Fill color box must be forward in the toolbox. If 
you’re applying color to the stroke, the Stroke color box must be forward.
Table 9-1 lists keyboard shortcuts that can be a tremendous help to you 
when applying colors to fills and strokes.

Try this trick: Drag a color from the Swatches panel to the Fill or Stroke 
color box. This action applies the color to the color box that you dragged to. 
It doesn’t matter which is forward!
To apply a fill color to an existing shape, drag the swatch directly to the 
shape. Select a swatch, hold down Alt+Shift+Ctrl (Windows) or Option+
Shift+Ô (Mac), and drag a color to a shape to apply that color to the stroke.

Changing the Width and Type of a Stroke
310
Changing the Width and Type of a Stroke
Access the Stroke panel by clicking the Stroke hyperlink in the Control 
panel. In the Stroke panel, you can choose caps (the end of a line), joins (the 
end points of a path or dash), and the miter limit (the length of a point). The 
Stroke panel also enables you to turn a path into a dashed line.
As you can see in Figure 9-2, you can choose, in the Stroke panel options, to 
align the stroke on the center (default) of a path, the inside of a path, and 
the outside of a path. Figure 9-3 shows the results.
 
Figure 9-2: 
The Align

options.
 
This feature is especially helpful when stroking outlined text. See Figure 9-3 
to compare text with the traditional centered stroke, as compared to the 
new option for aligning the stroke outside of a path.

You can also customize the following aspects of a stroke in the Stroke panel:
 
✦ Cap Options: The endpoints of a path or dash.
 
• Butt Cap: Click this button to make the ends of stroked lines square.
 
• Round Cap: Click this button to make the ends of stroked lines semi-
circular.
 
• Projecting Cap: Click this button to make the ends of stroked lines 
square and extend half the line width beyond the end of the line.
 
✦ Join Options: How corner points appear.
 
• Miter Join: Click this button to make stroked lines with pointed corners.
 
• Round Join: Click this button to make stroked lines with rounded 
corners.
 
• Bevel Join: Click this button to make stroked lines with squared corners.
 
✦ Dashed Lines: Regularly spaced lines, based upon values you set.
 
To create a dashed line, specify a dash sequence by entering the lengths of 
dashes and the gaps between them in the Dash Pattern text fields (see Figure 
9-4). The numbers entered are repeated in sequence so that after you set up 
the pattern, you don’t need to fill in all the text fields. In other words, if you 
want an evenly-spaced dashed stroke, just type the same number in the first 
and second text fields, and all dashes and spaces will be the same length 
(say, 12 pts). Change that to 12 in the first text field and 24 in the next, and 
now you have a larger space between the dashes.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Setting up 
a dashed 
stroke.
 
Using the Color Panel
The Color panel (access it by choosing Window➪Color) offers another 
method for choosing color. It requires you to custom pick a color using 
values on the color ramp. As a default, you see only the color ramp — the 

Saving Colors

large color well spanning the panel. If you don’t see all the color options, 
choose Show Options from the Color panel’s panel menu (click the triangle 
in the upper-right corner to access the panel menu).
 
Ever want to create tints of a CMYK color but aren’t quite sure how to adjust 
the individual color sliders? Hold down the Shift key while adjusting the 
color slider of any color and watch how all colors move to a relative position 
at the same time!
As shown in Figure 9-5, the panel menu offers many other choices. Even 
though you may be in the RGB or CMYK color mode, you can still choose to 
build colors in Grayscale, RGB, HSB (Hue Saturation Brightness), CMYK, or 
Web Safe RGB. Choosing Invert or Complement from the panel menu takes 
the selected object and inverses the color or changes it to a complementary 
color, respectively. You can also choose the Fill and Stroke color boxes in 
the upper-left corner of the Color panel.
 
Figure 9-5: 
Different 
color 
models are 
available in 
the Color

You see the infamous cube and exclamation point in the Color panels 
in most of Adobe’s software. The cube warns you that the color you’ve 
selected isn’t one of the 216 nondithering, Web-safe colors, and the excla-
mation point warns you that your color isn’t within the CMYK print gamut. 
In other words, if you see the exclamation point in the Color panel, don’t 
expect that really cool electric blue you see on-screen to print correctly — it 
may print as dark purple!
 
Click the cube or exclamation point symbols when you see them to select 
the closet color in the Web safe or CMYK color gamut.
Saving Colors
Saving colors not only keeps you consistent, but it makes edits and changes 
to colors easier in the future. Any time you build a color, drag it from the 
Color panel to the Swatches panel to save it as a color swatch for future use.

You can also select an object that uses the color and click the New Swatch 
button at the bottom of the Swatches panel (refer to Figure 9-1 to see this button). 
To save a color and name it at the same time, Alt-click (Windows) or Option-
click (Mac) the New Swatch icon. The New Swatch dialog box opens, where 
you can name and edit the color if you want. By double-clicking a swatch in 
the Swatches panel, you can open the options at any time.
A color in the Swatches panel is available only in the document in which it 
was created. Read the next section on custom libraries to see how to import 
swatches from saved documents.
Building and using custom libraries
When you save a color in the Swatches panel, you’re essentially saving it to 
your own custom library. You import the Swatches panel from one docu-
ment into another by using the Libraries feature.
Retrieve colors saved in a document’s Swatches panel by selecting the 
Swatch Libraries menu button at the bottom of the Swatches panel and drag-
ging down to Other Library. You can also access swatch libraries, including 
those in other documents, by choosing Window➪Swatch Libraries➪Other 
Library. Locate the saved document and click Open. A panel appears with 
the document name, as shown in Figure 9-6. You can’t edit the colors in this 
panel, but you can use the colors in this panel by double-clicking a swatch 
or dragging a swatch to your current document’s Swatches panel.

You can also click the Swatch Libraries button to access color libraries for 
Pantone colors, Web colors, and some neat creative colors, such as jewel 
tones and metals.
Using the Color Guide and color groups
Perhaps you failed at color in art class or just don’t feel that you’re one of 
those people who picks colors that look good together. In Illustrator CS4, 
you can use the Color Guide to find colors and save them to organized 
color groups in your Swatches panel. You can create color schemes based 
on 23 classic color-harmony rules, such as the Complementary, Analogous, 
Monochromatic, and Triad options, or you can create custom harmony rules.

Sounds complicated, doesn’t it? Fortunately, all you have to do is choose 
a base color and then see what variations you come up with according to 
rules you choose. Give it a try:
 
1. Choose Window➪Color Guide.
 
 The Color Guide appears, as shown in Figure 9-7.

2. Select a color from your Swatches panel. If your Swatches panel is not 
visible choose Window➪Swatches.
 
 Immediately, the Color Guide panel kicks in to provide you with colors 
that are related to your original swatch.
 
3. Change the Harmony Rules by clicking the Edit Colors button at the 
bottom of the Color Guide panel.
 
 The Edit Colors dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-8, appears.

 You could spend days experimenting in the Edit Colors dialog box, but 
for the scope of this book, you dive into changing simple harmony rules. 
To do this, click the Harmony Rules arrow to the right of the color bar. 
A drop-down list appears with many choices as to how you want colors 
selected, as shown in Figure 9-9. Choose a color harmony.
 
4. Save your color selection as a color group by clicking the New Color 
Group icon.
 
 If you like, you can rename the color group by double-clicking the group 
name in the Color Group section of the Live Color window.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The color group is added to the Swatches panel.

You don’t have to go through the Edit Colors dialog box in order to save a 
group of colors. You can Ctrl-click (Windows) or Ô-click (Mac) to select mul-
tiple colors and then click the New Color Group button at the bottom of the 
Swatches panel.
Adding Pantone colors
If you’re looking for the typical Pantone Matching System-numbered 
swatches, click the Swatch Libraries menu button at the bottom of the 
Swatches panel. From the drop-down list, choose Color Books and then 
Pantone solid coated, or whatever Pantone library you want to access.

Editing Colors
316
Colors for the Pantone numbering system are often referred to as PMS 485, 
or PMS 201, or whatever number the color has been designated. You can 
locate the numbered swatch by typing the number into the Find text field of 
the Pantone panel, as shown in Figure 9-10. When that number’s correspond-
ing color is highlighted in the panel, click it to add it to your Swatches panel. 
Many users find it easier to see colored swatches by using the List View. 
Choose Small List View or Large List View from the panel menu.

Editing Colors
Edit colors in the Swatches panel by using the Swatch Options dialog box (as 
shown in Figure 9-11), which you access by double-clicking the color or by 
choosing Swatch Options from the Swatches panel menu.

Use the Swatch Options dialog box to
 
✦ Change the color values: Change the values in a color by using the slid-
ers or by typing values into the color text fields. Having the ability to 
enter exact color values is especially helpful if you’re given a color build 
to match. Select the Preview check box to see results as you make the 
changes.
 
✦ Use global colors: If you plan on using a color frequently, select the 
Global check box. If the Global check box is selected and you use the 
swatch throughout the artwork, you only have to change the swatch 
options one time and all instances of that color are updated.
One important option to note in the Swatch Options dialog box is the Color 
Type drop-down list. You have two choices here: spot color and process 
color. What’s the difference?
 
✦ Spot color: A color that isn’t broken down into the CMYK values. Spot 
colors are used for 1–2 color print runs or when precise color matching 
is important.
 
 Suppose that you’re printing 20,000 catalogs and decide to run only 2 
colors, red and black. If you pick spot colors, the catalogs have to go 
through the press only two times: once for black and once for red. If red 
were a process color, however, it’d be created out of a combination of 
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks, and the catalogs would need to 
go through the press four times in order to build that color. Plus, if you 
went to a print service and asked for red, what color would you get? 
Fire-engine red, maroon, or a light and delicate pinkish-red? But if the 
red you pick is PMS 485, your printer in Lancaster, Pennsylvania can 
now print the same color of red on your brochure as the printer doing 
your business cards in Woburn, Massachusetts.
 
✦ Process color: A color that’s built from four colors (cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black). Process colors are used for multicolor jobs.
 
 For example, you’d want to use process colors if you’re sending an ad to 
a four-color magazine. The magazine printers certainly want to use the 
same inks they’re already running, and using a spot color would require 
another run through the presses in addition to the runs for the cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black plates. In this case, you’d take any spot colors 
created in corporate logos and such and convert them to process colors.

Building and Editing Patterns
318
Choose the Spot Colors option from the Swatches panel menu to choose 
whether you want spot colors changed to Lab or CMYK values:
 
✦ Choose Lab to get the best possible CMYK conversion for the actual 
spot color when using a color-calibrated workflow.
 
✦ Choose CMYK (default) to get the manufacturer’s standard recom-
mended conversion of spot colors to process. Results can vary depend-
ing upon printing conditions.
Building and Editing Patterns
Using patterns can be as simple or as complicated as you want. If you 
become familiar with the basics, you can take off in all sorts of creative 
directions. To build a simple pattern, start by creating the artwork that you 
want to use as a pattern on your artboard — polka dots, smiley faces, wavy 
lines, whatever. Then select all the components of the pattern and drag 
them to the Swatches panel. That’s it, you made a pattern! Use the pattern 
by selecting it as the fill or stroke of an object.
 
You can’t use patterns in artwork that will then be saved as a pattern. If you 
have a pattern in your artwork and try to drag it into the Swatches panel, 
Illustrator kicks it back out with no error message. On a good note, you can 
drag text right into the Swatches panel to become a pattern.
You can update patterns that you created or patterns that already reside in 
the Swatches panel. To edit an existing pattern, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the pattern swatch in the Swatches panel and drag it to the art-
board.
 
2. Deselect the pattern and use the Direct Selection tool to change its 
colors or shapes or whatever.
 
 Keep making changes until you’re happy with the result.
 
3. To update the pattern with your new edited version, use the Selection 
tool to select all pattern elements and Alt+drag (Windows) or 
Option+drag (Mac) the new pattern over the existing pattern swatch in 
the Swatches panel.
 
4. When a black border appears around the existing pattern, release the 
mouse button.
 
 All instances of the pattern in your illustration are updated.

Working with Gradients
319
 
If you want to add some space between tiles, as shown in Figure 9-12, create a 
bounding box using a rectangle shape with no fill or stroke (representing the 
repeat that you want to create). Send it behind the other objects in the pattern 
and drag all objects, including the bounding box, to the Swatches panel.
 
Figure 9-12: 
A pattern 
with a 
transparent 
bounding 
box.
 
We cover transformations in detail in Chapter 10 of this minibook, but some 
specific transform features apply to patterns. To scale a pattern, but not 
the object that it’s filling, double-click the Scale tool. In the Scale dialog box 
that appears, type the value that you want to scale but deselect all options 
except for Patterns, as shown in Figure 9-13. This works for the Rotate tool 
as well!
 
Figure 9-13:

scale or 
rotate only

Working with Gradients
Create gradients for nice smooth metallic effects or just to add dimension 
to illustrations. If you’re not sure which swatches are considered gradients, 
choose Gradient from the Show Swatch Kinds button at the bottom of the 
Swatches panel.
Once applied, you can access the Gradient panel (as shown in Figure 9-14) 
by choosing Window➪Gradient. Choose Show Options from the Gradient 
panel menu to see more options.

On the Gradient panel, use the Type drop-down list to choose a Radial gradi-
ent (one that radiates from the center point) or a Linear gradient (one that 
follows a linear path).
Use the Gradient tool to change the direction and distance of a gradient 
blend as follows:
 
1. Select an object and apply any existing gradient from the Swatches 
panel to its fill.
 
2. Choose the Gradient tool (press G) and drag in the direction that you 
want the gradient to go.
 
 Drag a long path for a smooth, long gradient. Drag a short path for a 
short, more defined gradient.
To create a new gradient, click on the basic B & W Linear Gradient swatch 
in the Swatches panel (this puts you at a good base point), and then follow 
these steps:
 
1. With the Gradient panel options visible, click the gradient box at the 
bottom of the panel.
 
 Two color stops appear, one on each end.
 
2. Activate a color stop by clicking it.
 
 When a color stop is active, the triangle on the top turns solid.

3. Choose Window➪Color to access the Color panel and then click the 
triangle in the upper-right corner to open the panel menu; choose 
RGB or CMYK colors.
 
4. Click the gradient ramp (across the bottom) in the Color panel to pick 
a random color (or enter values in the text fields to select a specific 
color) for the active color stop in the Gradient panel.
 
 Repeat this step to select colors for other color stops.
To add additional color stops, click beneath the gradient ramp and then 
choose a color from the Color panel. You can also drag a swatch from the 
Swatches panel to add a new color to the gradient. To remove a color stop, 
drag it off the Gradient panel.
 
In CS4, you can click the gradient ramp to add additional colors and also 
change the opacity of that location of the ramp by entering values in the 
Opacity text box. This is a great way to create stripes and other reflective 
gradients.
Copying Color Attributes
 
 Wouldn’t it be great if you had tools that could record all the fill and stroke 
attributes and apply them to other shapes? You’re in luck — the Eyedropper 
tool can do just that! Copy the fill and stroke of an object and apply it to 
another object with the Eyedropper tool as follows:
 
1. Create several shapes with different fill and stroke attributes, or open 
an existing file that contains several different objects.
 
2. Select the Eyedropper tool and click a shape that has attributes you 
want to copy.
 
3. Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) another object to apply 
those attributes.
Not only is this technique simple, but you can change the attributes that the 
Eyedropper applies. Do so by double-clicking the Eyedropper tool; in the 
dialog box that appears, select only the attributes that you want to copy.
The Live Trace Feature
If you’re looking for good source art to use to experiment with color, look no 
further than your own sketches and scanned images. You can automatically 
trace bitmap images by using a variety of settings that range from black-and-
white line art to vector art with multitudes of color that can be extracted 
from your image.

The Live Paint Feature
322
To use the Live Trace feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Place and select an image that you want to trace.
 
 The file you place can be a logo, a sketch, or even a photo. Notice that 
after you place the image, the Control panel offers additional options.
 
2. Click the arrow to the right of the Live Trace button.
 
 This drop-down list provides Live Trace presets that may help you 
better trace your image.
 
3. Scroll to the bottom and choose Tracing Options.
 
 The Tracing Options dialog box appears.
 
4. Select the Preview check box and experiment with the various set-
tings, as shown in Figure 9-15.
 
5. When you find the setting that works best for your image, click the 
Trace button.
You can return to the Tracing Options dialog box and change settings over 
and over again until you find the best one.

Painting made easy! Don’t worry about filling closed shapes or letting fills 
escape out of objects with gaps into unwanted areas. With the Live Paint 
feature, you can create the image you want and fill in regions with color. The 
Live Paint bucket automatically detects regions composed of independent 
intersecting paths and fills them accordingly. The paint within a given region 
remains live and flows automatically if any of the paths are moved.

If you want to give it a try, follow these steps to put together an example to 
experiment with:
 
1. With the Ellipse tool, create a circle on your page.
 
 Make it large enough to accommodate two or three inner circles.
 
2. Press D (just D, nothing else).
 
 As long as you’re not on the Type tool, you revert to the default colors 
of a black stroke and a white fill.
 
3. Double-click the Scale tool and enter 75% in the Uniform Scale text box.
 
4. Press the Copy button and then click OK.
 
 You see a smaller circle inside the original.
 
5. Press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Ô+D (Mac) to duplicate the transformation 
and create another circle inside the last one.
 
6. Choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Ô+A (Mac) to activate 
the circles you just created.
 
7. Make sure that the Fill swatch is forward.
 
 The Fill swatch is at the bottom of the toolbox.
 
8. Use the Swatches or Color panel and choose any fill color.
 
9. Select the Live Paint Bucket tool and move the cursor over the various 
regions of the circles.
 
 See how the different regions become highlighted?
 
10. Click when you have the region activated that you want to fill.
 
 Now try it with other fill colors in different regions, as shown in Figure 9-16.

A companion feature to the Live Paint bucket is support for gap detection. 
With this feature, Illustrator automatically and dynamically detects and 
closes small to large gaps that may be part of the artwork. You can deter-
mine whether you want paint to flow across region gap boundaries by using 
the Gap Options dialog box, accessibly by choosing Object➪Live Paint➪Gap 
Options. The Gap Options dialog box is shown in Figure 9-17.
 
Before you save a file for an older version of Illustrator that uses the Live 
Paint feature, it’s best to first select the occurrences of Live Paint and choose 
Object➪Expand. When the Expand dialog box appears, leave the options at 
their default and click OK. This setting breaks down the Live Paint objects to 
individual shapes, which older versions of Illustrator can understand.

T
ransformations that you can give to objects in Illustrator include scal-
ing, rotating, skewing, and distorting. In this chapter, we show you how 
to use the general transform tools as well as some of the neat Liquify and 
Envelope Distort features available in Illustrator.
Working with Transformations
With just the Selection tool, you can scale and rotate a selected object. Drag 
the bounding box handles to resize the object (as shown in Figure 10-1) or 
get outside a handle, and then, when the cursor changes to a flippy arrow (a 
curved arrow with arrowheads on both ends), drag to rotate the object.
 
Figure 10-1: 
Use the 
bounding 
box to resize 
or rotate a 
selected 
object.
 

Working with Transformations
326
 
If you want to scale proportionally, hold down the Shift key while you drag 
to resize. To rotate an object at 45-degree increments, hold down the Shift 
key while you’re rotating.
When you use the bounding box to rotate a selection, the bounding box 
rotates with the object, but its handles show the object’s original orienta-
tion, as shown in Figure 10-2. This can help you to keep track of the original 
placement but can also interfere when you’re building additional artwork. 
To reset the bounding box so that it’s straight at the new orientation, choose 
Object➪Transform➪Reset Bounding Box.
 
Figure 10-2:
The 
bounding 
box shows 
the original 
placement.
 
 
When you scale, rotate, or use any other type of transformation in Illustrator, 
the final location becomes the zero point. In other applications, such as 
InDesign, you can rotate an object by any number of degrees (45 degrees, 
for example) and later enter 0 for the rotation angle in the Transform panel 
or in the Rotate dialog box to return the object to its original position. With 
Illustrator, if you enter 0 for the rotation angle to return a rotated object to 
its original position, the object won’t change its position. To return the object 
to the previous position in Illustrator, you have to enter the negative of the 
number you originally entered to rotate the object, so you would enter –45 
for the degree of rotation in this example.
Transforming an object
The Rotate, Reflect, Scale, and Shear tools all use the same basic steps to 
perform transformations. Read on for those basic steps, and then follow 
through some individual examples of the most often used transform tools. 
The following sections show five ways to transform an object: one for an 

Book III

and Distortions 
Tools

arbitrary transformation and four others for exact transformations based on 
a numeric amount that you enter.
Arbitrary transformation method
This method is arbitrary, meaning that you’re eyeballing the transformation 
of an object — in other words, you don’t have an exact percentage or angle 
in mind, and you want to freely transform the object until it looks right. Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select an object and then choose a transform tool (the Rotate, Reflect, 
Scale, or Shear tool).
 
2. Click once on the artboard.
 
 Be careful where you click because the click determines the point of ref-
erence, or axis point, for the transformation, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
3. Drag in one smooth movement.
 
 Just drag until you get the transformation that you want.
 
Hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key when dragging to clone a 
newly transformed item while keeping the original object intact. This is espe-
cially helpful when you’re using the Reflect tool.

Working with Transformations
328
Exact transformation methods
In the following methods, we show you how to perform transformations with 
specific numeric information:
 
✦ Exact transformation method 1: Using the tool’s dialog box
 
1. Select an object and then choose the Rotate, Reflect, Scale, or Shear tool.
 
2. Double-click the transform tool in the toolbox.
 
 A dialog box specific to your chosen tool appears. For this example, 
we selected and then double-clicked the Rotate tool to bring up the 
Rotate dialog box.
 
3. Type an angle, scaled amount, or percentage in the appropriate text field.
 
4. Select the Preview check box to see the effect of the transformation 
before you click OK; click the Copy button instead of OK to keep the 
original object intact and transform a copy.
 
✦ Exact transformation method 2: Using the reference point
 
1. Select an object and then choose the Rotate, Reflect, Scale, or Shear tool.
 
2. Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) where you want the refer-
ence point to be.
 
3. In the appropriate transform tool dialog box that appears, enter your 
values and click OK or click the Copy button to apply your transformation.
 
 This is the best method to use if you need to rotate an object an 
exact amount on a defined axis.
 
✦ Exact transformation method 3: Using the Transform menu
 
1. Select an object and then choose a transform option from the Object➪
Transform menu.
 
 The appropriate transform dialog box appears.
 
2. Enter your values and click OK or the Copy button.
 
✦ Exact transformation method 4: Using the Transform panel
 
 Select an object and choose Window➪Transform to access the 
Transform panel, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
Figure 10-4:
The 
Transform 
panel allows 
you to enter 
values.

While using the Transform panel is probably the easiest way to go, it doesn’t 
give you the option of specifying an exact reference point (by a click with your 
mouse) or some other options that apply to the individual transform tools.
Using the Transform tools
In this section, we show you how to use some of the most popular 
Transform tools to create transformations.
The Reflect tool
Nothing is symmetrical, right? Maybe not, but objects that aren’t created 
symmetrically in Illustrator can look pretty off kilter. With the Reflect tool, 
you can reflect an object to create an exact mirrored shape of it; just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open a new document in Illustrator and type some text or create an 
object.
 
 If you want to reflect text, make sure that you use at least 60-point type 
so that you can easily see what you’re working with.
 
 2. Select the Reflect tool (hidden under the Rotate tool) and click the 
object; if you’re using text, click in the middle of the text’s baseline.
 
 This step sets the reference point for the reflection.
 
3. Alt+Shift+drag (Windows) or Option+Shift+drag (Mac) and release 
when the object or text is reflecting itself, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
 This step not only clones the reflected object or text, but also snaps it to 
45-degree angles.
 
Figure 10-5:
The 
completed 
reflection.
 

Working with Transformations
330
The Scale tool
With the Scale tool, you can scale an object proportionally or non-uniformly. 
Most people like to be scaled non-uniformly, maybe a little taller, a little thin-
ner, but on with the topic. Follow these steps to see the Scale tool in action:
 
1. Create a shape and give it no fill and a 5-point black stroke.
 
 For this example, we created a circle. See Chapter 4 of this minibook if 
you need a reminder on how to do this.
 
 2. Select your shape and double-click the Scale tool.
 
 
 The Scale dialog box appears.
 
3. Type a number in the Scale text field (in the Uniform section) and 
click the Copy button.
 
 We entered 125 in the Scale text field to increase the size of the object 
by 125 percent.
 
4. Press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Ô+D (Mac) to repeat the transformation as 
many times as you want.
 
 Each time you press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Ô+D (Mac), the shape is 
copied and sized by the percent you entered in the Scale text field. This 
is especially handy with circles and creates an instant bull’s-eye!
To experiment with the Scale tool, create different shapes in Step 1 and enter 
different values in Step 3. Remember that if you type 50% in the Scale text 
field, the object is made smaller; go over 100% — say to 150% — to make the 
object larger. Leaving the Scale text field at 100% has no effect on the object.
The Shear tool
 
 The Shear tool enables you to shear an object by selecting an axis and 
dragging to set a shear angle, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
Figure 10-6: 
Create 
perspective 
with the 
Shear tool.
 

Book III
Chapter 10
Using the Transform 
and Distortions 
Tools
Creating Distortions
331
The axis will always be the center of the object unless you use method 1 or 
method 2 from the earlier section, “Exact transformation methods.” Use the 
Shear tool in combination with the Rotate tool to give an object perspective.
The Reshape tool
The Reshape tool enables you to select anchor points and sections of paths 
and adjust them in one direction. You determine that direction by dragging 
an anchor point with the Reshape tool selected.
 
 The Reshape tool works differently from the other transform tools. To use it, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select just the anchor points on the paths that you want to reshape. 
Deselect any points that you want to remain in place.
 
2. Select the Reshape tool (hidden under the Scale tool) and position the 
cursor over the anchor point that you want to modify; click the anchor 
point.
 
 If you click a path segment, a highlighted anchor point with a square 
around it is added to the path.
 
3. Shift-click more anchor points or path segments to act as selection 
points.
 
 You can highlight an unlimited number of anchor points or path 
segments.
 
4. Drag the highlighted anchor points to adjust the path.
The Free Transform tool
 
 You use the Free Transform tool pretty much like you use the bounding box. 
(See the earlier section, “Working with Transformations.”) This tool is neces-
sary only if you choose View➪Hide Bounding Box but want free transform 
capabilities.
Creating Distortions
Bend objects, make them wavy, gooey, or spiky — you can do all these 
things by creating simple to complex distortions with the Liquify tools and 
the Envelope Distort features.
The Liquify tools
The Liquify tools can accomplish all sorts of creative or wacky (depending 
on how you look at it) distortions to your objects. You can choose from 
seven Liquify tools. Even though we define these for you in Table 10-1, you

really need to experiment with these tools to understand their full capabili-
ties. Here are some tips:
 
✦ A variety of Liquify tools are available by holding down the mouse 
button on the default selection, the Warp tool. If you use them fre-
quently, drag to the arrow at the end of the tools and release when you 
see the ToolTip for Tearoff. You can then position the tools anywhere in 
your work area.
 
✦ Double-click any of the Liquify tools to bring up a dialog box specific to

Using the Envelope Distort command
Use the Envelope Distort command to arch text and apply other creative 
distortions to an Illustrator object. To use the Envelope Distort command, 
you can use a preset warp (the easiest method), a grid, or a top object to 
determine the amount and type of distortion. In this section, we discuss all 
three methods.
Using the preset warps
Experimenting is a little more interesting if you have a word or object 
selected before trying the different warp presets. To warp an object or text 
to a preset style, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text or object that you want to distort and then choose 
Object➪Envelope Distort➪Make with Warp.
 
 The Warp Options dialog box appears.
 
2. Choose a warp style from the Style drop-down list and then specify 
any other options you want.
 
3. Click OK to apply your distortion.
Note: If you want to experiment with warping but also want to revert to the 
original at any time, choose Effect➪Warp. You later change or delete the 
Warp Effect by double-clicking it in the Appearance panel or by dragging the 
effect to the trash can in the Appearance panel. Find out more about exciting 
effects that you can apply to objects in Chapter 12 of this minibook.
Reshaping with a mesh grid
You can also assign a grid to the objects to give you the ability to drag differ-
ent points and create your own custom distortion, as shown in Figure 10-7.

Follow these steps to apply a mesh grid:
 
1. Using the Select tool, select the text or object that you want to distort 
and then choose Object➪Envelope Distort➪Make with Mesh.
 
 The Envelope Mesh dialog box appears.
 
2. Specify the number of rows and columns that you want the mesh to 
contain and then click OK.
 
3. Drag any anchor point on the mesh grid with the Direct Selection tool 
to reshape the object.
 
To delete anchor points on the mesh grid, select an anchor point with the 
Direct Selection tool and press the Delete key.
 
 You can also use the Mesh tool to edit and delete points when using a mesh 
grid on objects.
Reshaping an object with a different object
To form letters into the shape of an oval or distort selected objects into 
another object, use this technique:
 
1. Create text that you want to distort.
 
2. Create the object that you want to use as the envelope (the object to 
be used to define the distortion).
 
3. Choose Object➪Arrange to make sure that the envelope object is on 
top, as shown in Figure 10-8.
 
4. Select the text and Shift-click to select the envelope object.
 
5. Choose Object➪Envelope Distort➪Make with Top Object.
The underlying object is distorted to fit the shape of the top (envelope) 
object.

✓ Using the Symbol Sprayer tool
✓ Discovering transparency, blend modes, and opacity masks
T
his chapter is full of neat things that you can do using some of the more 
advanced features in Adobe Illustrator. These special effects tools can 
help you create art that really makes an impact: Discover how to make your 
art look like a painting with the Gradient Mesh tool, create morph-like blends 
with the Blend tool, become a pseudo-graffiti artist by trying out the Symbol 
Sprayer tool, and see what’s underneath objects by using transparency!
The Mesh Tool
If you’re creating art in Illustrator that requires solid colors or continuous 
patterns, you can achieve those results quite easily. But what if you’re work-
ing on something that requires continuous tones, like a person’s face? In that 
case, you’d turn to the very handy Mesh tool, which enables you to create the 
impression that you used paint and paintbrushes to create your illustration. 
Choose to blend one color into another and then use the Mesh tool to adjust 
where the blends occur and how dramatic the blends should be.
The Mesh tool can be as complex or simple as you want. Create intense 
illustrations that look like they were created with an airbrush, or just use it 
to give an object dimension, like the objects shown in Figure 11-1.
We show you how to create a gradient mesh two different ways: First by 
clicking (which gives you a little more freedom to put mesh points where 
you want them) and then by manually setting the number of rows and 
columns in the mesh (which is a more precise method).

The Mesh Tool
338
 
Figure 11-1: 
Illustrations 
can be 
complex or

the Mesh 
tool.
 
 
You can change the color in mesh points by choosing the Direct Selection 
tool and either clicking a mesh point and picking a fill color, or by clicking in 
the center of a mesh area and choosing a fill. Whether you select the mesh 
point (see the left side of Figure 11-2) or area in between the mesh points 
(see the right side of Figure 11-2) changes the painting result. To add a mesh 
point without changing to the current fill color, Shift-click anywhere in a 
filled vector object.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The mesh 
point 
changes 
the painting 
result.
 
To create a gradient mesh by clicking, follow these steps:
 
1. Create any shape using the shape tools and then deselect all objects 
by choosing Select➪Deselect.
 
2. Select a fill color that you want to apply as a mesh point to an object.
 
 For example, if you have a red circle and you want a shaded white spot, 
choose white for your fill color.
 
3. Select the Mesh tool (keyboard shortcut is U) and click anywhere in a 
filled vector object.
 
 The object is converted to a mesh object.
 
4. Click the object as many times as you want to add additional mesh 
points.
To create a gradient mesh by setting the number of rows and columns, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select an object.

2. Choose Object➪Create Gradient Mesh.
 
 The Create Gradient Mesh dialog box appears.
 
3. Set the number of rows and columns of mesh lines to create on the 
object by entering numbers in the Rows and Columns text fields.
 
4. Choose the direction of the highlight from the Appearance drop-down 
list.
 
 The direction of the highlight determines in what way the gradient flows 
(see Figure 11-3); you have the following choices:
 
• Flat: Applies the object’s original color evenly across the surface, 
resulting in no highlight.
 
• To Center: Creates a highlight in the center of the object.
 
• To Edge: Creates a highlight on the edges of the object.
 
5. Enter a percentage of white highlight to apply to the mesh object in 
the Highlight text field.
 
6. Click OK to apply the gradient mesh to the object.

Choose a 
highlight 
direction.
 
The Blend Tool
 
 Use the Blend tool (located in the main Illustrator toolbox) to transform one 
object to another to create interesting morphed artwork or to create shaded 
objects. With the Blend tool, you can give illustrations a rendered look by 
blending from one color to another, or you can create an even amount of 
shapes from one point to another. Figure 11-4 shows examples of what you 
can do with this tool.

tool.
 

The Blend Tool
340
Creating a blend isn’t difficult, and as you get used to it, you can take it far-
ther and farther, creating incredibly realistic effects with it. Follow these 
steps to create a simple blend from one sized rectangle to another, creating 
an algorithmic stripe pattern (a rectangle of one height blended to a rect-
angle of another height):
 
1. Create a rectangle.
 
 Size doesn’t really matter for this example; you just want to make sure 
that you can see a difference in shapes when you blend. We’re using a 
rectangle that’s roughly 4 x 1 inches.
 
2. Give your shape a fill and assign None to the stroke.
 
 You can use other settings here, but we recommend keeping it simple if 
you’re still new to working with blends.
 
3. With the Selection tool, click the rectangle and Alt+drag (Windows) 
or Option+drag (Mac) toward the bottom of the artboard to clone your 
shape; press the Shift key before you release the mouse button to 
make sure that the cloned shape stays perfectly aligned with the origi-
nal shape.
 
4. Reduce the cloned shape to about half its original height by using 
the Transform panel (if the Transform panel isn’t visible, choose 
Window➪Transform).
 
 Alternatively, you can hold down the Shift key and drag the bottom-
middle bounding box handle, as shown in Figure 11-5.
 
5. In the Swatches panel (choose Window➪Swatches), change the cloned 
shape’s fill to a different color but keep the stroke at None.
 
 Changing the color just helps you see the blend effect a little better.
 
6. With the Blend tool, click the original shape and then click the cloned 
shape.
 
 As a default, the Blend tool creates a smooth blend that transitions 
from one color to another, as shown in Figure 11-6. To change the blend 
effect, experiment with the Blend Options dialog box.

You can change the way that a blend appears by using the Blend Options dialog 
box, which you access by choosing Object➪Blend➪Blend Options. From the 
Spacing drop-down list, change the blend to one of the following options:
 
✦ Smooth Color: The blend steps are calculated to provide the optimum 
number of steps for a smooth transition.
 
✦ Specified Steps: You can determine the number of steps in a blend by 
typing a number in the text field to the right of the drop-down list.
 
✦ Specified Distance: You control the distance between the steps in the 
blend by typing a number in the text field to the right of the drop-down list.
You can also choose between two orientation options: Align to Page (orients 
the blend perpendicular to the X-axis of the page) or Align to Path (orients 
the blend perpendicular to the path). You probably won’t see a difference 
when changing orientation unless you’ve edited the blend path.
 
You can easily access the Blend tool options by selecting a blended object 
and double-clicking the Blend tool in the toolbox.
If you’re feeling adventurous, try changing a smooth blend (such as the one 
you create in the preceding steps) into a logarithmic blend. In the Blend 
Options dialog box, choose Specified Steps from the Spacing drop-down list 
and change the value to 5. This change creates the blend in 5 steps instead of 
the 200 plus steps that may have been necessary to create the smooth blend.
Here are a few more tips to help you become more comfortable with blends:
 
✦ You can blend between an unlimited number of objects, colors, opaci-
ties, or gradients.
 
✦ Blends can be edited directly with tools, such as the Selection tools, the 
Rotate tool, or the Scale tool.
 
✦ A straight path is created between blended objects when the blend is 
first applied. You can switch to the Direct Selection tool and edit the 
blend path by dragging anchor points.

The Symbol Sprayer Tool
342
 
✦ You can edit blends that you created by moving, resizing, deleting, 
or adding objects. After you make editing changes, the artwork is re-
blended automatically.
The Symbol Sprayer Tool
The Symbol Sprayer tool is a super tool that you must experiment with to 
understand its full potential. In a nutshell, however, what it does is work 
like a can of spray paint that, instead of spraying paint, sprays symbols — 
objects that, in Illustrator, can be either vector- or pixel-based. Each symbol 
is an instance.
Illustrator comes with a library of symbols ready for use in the Symbols 
panel (if the Symbols panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Symbols). Use this 
panel as a storage bin or library to save repeatedly used artwork or to create 
your own symbols to apply as instances in your artwork, like blades of grass 
or stars in the sky. You can then use the symbolism tools, described in Table 
11-1, to adjust and change the appearance of the symbol instances.

Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key to reduce the effect of the sym-
bolism tools. In other words, if you’re using the Symbol Sizer tool, you click 
and hold to make the symbol instances larger; hold down the Alt (Windows) 
or Option (Mac) key to make the symbol instances smaller.
You can also selectively choose the symbols that you want to effect with 
the Symbolism tools by activating them in the Symbols panel. Ctrl-click 
(Windows) or Ô-click (Mac) multiple symbols to change them at the same 
time.
 
Just about anything can be a symbol, including placed objects and objects 
with patterns and gradients. If you’re going to use placed images as symbols, 
however, choose File➪Place and deselect the Linked check box in the Place 
dialog box.
To create a symbol, select the object and drag it into the Symbols panel or 
click the New Symbol button at the bottom of the Symbols panel. Yes, it’s 
that easy. Then use the Symbol Sprayer tool to apply the symbol instance on 
the artboard by following these steps:
 
1. Select the symbol instance in the Symbols panel.
 
 Either create your own symbol or use one of the default symbols sup-
plied in the panel.
 
2. Drag with the Symbol Sprayer tool, spraying the symbol on the art-
board (see Figure 11-7).
 
 And that’s it. You can increase or reduce the area affected by the 
Symbol Sprayer tool by pressing the bracket keys. Press ] repeatedly to 
enlarge the application area for the symbol or press [ to make it smaller.

Note that you can access all sorts of symbol libraries from the Symbols 
panel menu. Find 3D, nature, maps, flowers, and even hair and fur symbol 
collections by selecting Open Symbol Library.
 
Want to store artwork that you frequently need to access? Simply drag the 
selected object(s) into the Symbols panel, or Alt-click (Windows) or Option-
click (Mac) the New Symbol button to name and store the artwork. Retrieve 
the artwork later by dragging it from the Symbols panel to the artboard. In 
fact, you can drag any symbol out to your artboard to change or use it in 
your own artwork. To release the symbol back into its basic elements, choose 
Object➪Expand. In the Expand dialog box, click OK to restore the defaults.
Transparency
Using transparency can add a new level to your illustrations. The transpar-
ency feature does exactly what its name implies: It changes an object to 
make it transparent so that what’s underneath that object is visible to vary-
ing degrees. You can use the Transparency panel for simple applications of 
transparency to show through to underlying objects, or you can use trans-
parency for more complex artwork using opacity masks, masks that can con-
trol the visibility of selected objects.
Choosing Window➪Transparency brings up the Transparency panel where 
you can apply different levels of transparency to objects. To do so, create 
an arrangement of objects that intersect, select the topmost object, and 
then change the transparency level of the object in the Transparency panel, 
either by moving the Opacity slider or by entering a value of less than 100 in 
the Opacity text field.
Blend modes
A blending mode determines how the resulting transparency will look. So to 
achieve different blending effects, you choose different blend modes from 
the Blend Mode drop-down list in the Transparency panel.
 
Truly, the best way to find out what all these modes do is to create two 
shapes that are overlapping and start experimenting. Give the shapes dif-
ferently colored fills (but note that many of the blending modes don’t work 
with black and white fills). Then select the topmost object and change the 
blending mode by selecting an option from the Blend Mode drop-down list in 
the Transparency panel. You’ll see all sorts of neat effects and probably end 
up picking a few favorites.

We define each blend mode in the following list (but we’ll say it again, the best 
way to see what each one does is to apply them — so start experimenting!):
 
✦ Normal: Creates no interaction with underlying colors.
 
✦ Darken: Replaces only the areas that are lighter than the blend color. 
Areas darker than the blend color don’t change.
 
✦ Multiply: Creates an effect similar to drawing on the page with magic 
markers. Also looks like the colored film you see on theater lights.
 
✦ Color Burn: Darkens the base color to reflect the blend color. If you’re 
using white, no change occurs.
 
✦ Lighten: Replaces only the areas darker than the blend color. Areas 
lighter than the blend color don’t change.
 
✦ Screen: Multiplies the inverse of the underlying colors. The resulting 
color is always a lighter color.
 
✦ Color Dodge: Brightens the underlying color to reflect the blend color. If 
you’re using black, there’s no change.
 
✦ Overlay: Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the base color.
 
✦ Soft Light: Darkens or lightens the colors, depending on the blend color. 
The effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the artwork.
 
✦ Hard Light: Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the blend 
color. The effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the artwork.
 
✦ Difference: Subtracts either the blend color from the base color or the 
base color from the blend color, depending on which has the greater 
brightness value. The effect is similar to a color negative.
 
✦ Exclusion: Creates an effect similar to, but with less contrast than, the 
Difference mode.
 
✦ Hue: Applies the hue (color) of the blend object onto the underlying 
objects, but keeps the underlying shading, or luminosity.
 
✦ Saturation: Applies the saturation of the blend color, but uses the lumi-
nance and hue of the base color.
 
✦ Color: Applies the blend object’s color to the underlying objects but 
preserves the gray levels in the artwork. This is great for tinting objects 
or changing their color.
 
✦ Luminosity: Creates a resulting color with the hue and saturation of the 
base color and the luminance of the blend color. This is essentially the 
opposite of the Color mode.

Opacity masks
Just like in Photoshop, you can use masks to make more interesting artwork 
in Illustrator. Create an opacity mask from the topmost object in a selection 
of objects or by drawing a mask on a single object. The mask uses the gray-
scale of the object selected to be the opacity mask. Black areas are totally 
transparent; shades of gray are semi-transparent, depending on the amount 
of gray; and white areas are totally opaque. Figure 11-8 shows the effect of an 
opacity mask.
 
Figure 11-8: 
An opacity 
mask takes 
the topmost 
object and 
masks 
underlying 
objects.
 
To create an opacity mask, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Transparency panel menu (click the arrow in the upper-right 
corner to access this menu) and choose Hide Thumbnails.
 
 Also, be sure that the Blend Mode drop-down list is set to Normal.
 
2. Create a shape anywhere on the artboard or open a document that 
has artwork on it.
 
 We’re using a circle, but the shape doesn’t matter. Make sure that the 
artwork has a fill. A solid color will help you see the effect.
 
3. Open the Symbols panel (choose Window➪Symbols Panel) and drag a 
symbol to the artboard.
 
 For this example, we’re using the drums symbol.
 
4. With the Selection tool, enlarge your symbol so that it fills your shape 
(see image on the left in Figure 11-9).

5. Select both the symbol and the shape and then choose Make Opacity 
Mask from the Transparency panel menu (see image on the right

 The symbol turns into a mask, showing varying levels of the underlying 
box through, depending on the original color value. To delete an opacity 
mask, choose Release Opacity Mask from the Transparency panel menu.

Click the right thumbnail (this is the mask) in the Transparency panel, and a

items on the mask or even create items to be added to the mask. The mask 
works just like the regular artboard, except that anything done on the mask 
side will only be used as an opacity mask. To work on the regular artboard, 
click the left thumbnail.

and Effects
In This Chapter
✓ Applying effects
✓ Getting to know the Appearance panel
✓ Discovering graphic styles
✓ Making artwork 3D
✓ Playing with additional fills and strokes
E
ffects give you the opportunity to do jazzy things to your Illustrator 
objects, such as adding drop shadows and squiggling artwork. You can 
even use Photoshop filters right in Illustrator. In this chapter, you find out 
how to apply, save, and edit effects; this chapter also gives you a quick tour of 
the Appearance panel (your trusty sidekick when performing these tasks).
Working with Effects
If you’re an Adobe Illustrator user from any version before CS4, you might 
be wondering . . . where’s the Filter menu? (If you’re just starting to use 
Illustrator, you really don’t need to know about, or even care about, this 
major change.) All the items that appeared in the Filter menu are now in the 
Effects menu.
Filters applied permanent changes to artwork, referred to as destruc-
tive changes, because after you save and close the file, you couldn’t 
undo the results for the filter. On the other hand, an effect is connected 
dynamically to the object. Effects are very different in that you can apply, 
change, and even remove effects at any time with the Appearance panel 
(Window➪Appearance).
Understanding the Appearance panel
You can apply multiple effects to one object and even copy the effects to 
multiple objects. This is when a good working knowledge of the Appearance 
panel is necessary. If it isn’t visible, choose Window➪Appearance to show 
the Appearance panel, as shown in Figure 12-1, alongside an object with sev-
eral effects applied to it.

how

As a default, if you have no effects applied, you see only a fill and a stroke 
listed in the Appearance panel. As you add effects, they’re added to this list. 
You can even add more strokes and fills to the list. Why would you do that? 
Because you can do incredible things with additional fills and strokes (which 
we show you in the upcoming section “Applying an effect”). See Figure 12-2 
for a breakdown of the features on the Appearance panel.

Applying an effect
In this section, you apply an effect. You can choose from many effects, and 
they’re all applied in much the same manner. In this example, we apply the 
Arrowhead effect.
Follow these steps to apply an effect:
 
1. Create a new document, choose any color mode, and draw a path in 
your document.

and Effects

 If you haven’t mastered the Pen tool yet (see Chapter 5 of this mini-
book), use the Pencil tool.
 
2. In the Control panel at the top of the Illustrator document, change the 
stroke to 3-pt and make sure that fill is set to None.
 
 Using a 3-point stroke enables you to see the stroke a little better.
 
3. Choose Effect➪Stylize➪Add Arrowheads.
 
 Make sure that you choose the top Stylize menu item.
 
 The Add Arrowheads dialog box appears (see Figure 12-3).
 
Figure 12-3: 
Use the Add 
Arrowheads 
dialog box 
to create 
arrows.
 
 
4. Add an arrowhead to both the start and the end of the path by using 
the arrow keys to scroll through the selections.
 
 Note that the Start arrowhead (top of the Add Arrowhead dialog box) 
will be placed on the first point you created; the End arrowhead (bottom 
of the dialog box) will be placed on the last point you created.
 
5. Choose the size of the arrowhead by typing a number in the Scale text 
field.
 
 You can go anywhere from 1 to 1,000 percent, but typically an arrow-
head is set at 50 percent. This scales the arrowhead relative to the 
selected line stroke weight.
 
Effects are linked dynamically to the object that they’re applied to. They 
can be scaled, modified, and even deleted with no harm done to the original 
object.

Adding a Drop Shadow effect
Creating a drop shadow is a quick and easy way of adding dimension and 
a bit of sophistication to your artwork. The interaction between the object 
with the drop shadow and the underlying objects can create an interesting 
look. To add the Drop Shadow effect to an illustration, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object(s) that’s to have the drop shadow applied.
 
2. Choose Effect➪Stylize➪Drop Shadow.
 
3. In the Drop Shadow dialog box that appears, select the Preview check 
box in the upper-right corner.
 
 You now see the drop shadow applied as you make changes.
 
4. Choose from the following options (see Figure 12-4):
 
• Mode: Select a blending mode from this drop-down list to choose 
how you want your selected object to interact with the objects 
underneath. The default is Multiply, which works well — the effect is 
similar to coloring with a magic marker.
 
• Opacity: Enter a value or use the drop-down list to determine how 
opaque or transparent the drop shadow should be. If it’s too strong, 
choose a lower amount.
 
• Offset: Enter a value to determine how close the shadow is to the 
object. If you’re working with text or small artwork, smaller values 
(and shorter shadow) look best. Otherwise, the drop shadow may 
look like one big indefinable glob.
 
 The X Offset shifts the shadow from left to right, and the Y Offset 
shifts it up or down. You can enter negative or positive numbers.
 
• Blur: Use Blur to control how fuzzy the edges of the shadow are. A 
lower value makes the edge of the shadow more defined.

• Color and Darkness: Select the Color radio button to choose a custom 
color for the drop shadow. Select the Darkness radio button to add 
more black to the drop shadow. Zero percent is the lowest amount of 
black, and 100 percent is the highest.
 
 As a default, the color of the shadow is based upon the color of your 
object, sort of . . . the Darkness option has a play in this, also. As a 
default, the shadow is made up of the color in the object if it’s solid. 
Multicolored objects have a gray shadow.
Saving Graphic Styles
A graphic style is a combination of all the settings you choose for a particu-
lar filter or effect in the Appearance panel. By saving this information in a 
graphic style, you store these attributes so that you can quickly and easily 
apply them to other objects later.
Choose Window➪Graphic Styles; in the panel that appears are thumbnails of 
many different styles that Adobe provides to you as a default. Create a new 
shape, such as a simple rectangle or ellipse, and click any of these graphic 
styles to apply the style to an active object. Look at the Appearance panel 
while you click different styles to see that you’re applying combinations of 
attributes, including effects, fills, and strokes (see Figure 12-5).
 
Find more styles by choosing the Graphic Styles panel menu (click the arrow in 
the upper-right corner of the panel) and selecting Open Graphic Style Library.

You can store attributes as a graphic style in several ways; we show you two 
easy methods. If you have a combination of attributes already applied to an 
object, store them by doing one of the following:
 
✦ With the object selected, Alt+click (Windows) or Option+click (Mac) 
the New Graphic Style button at the bottom of the Graphic Styles panel. 
Alt+clicking (Windows) or Option+clicking (Mac) allows you to name the 
style when it’s added.
 
✦ Drag the selected object right into the Graphic Styles panel. The panel 
stores its attributes, but you have to double-click the new style to name it.
After you store a graphic style, simply select the object that you want to 
apply the style to and then click the saved style in the Graphic Styles panel.
Creating 3D Artwork
All the effects in Illustrator are great, but this feature is really swell. Not 
only can you add dimension by using the 3D effect, you can also map art-
work (that is, wrap artwork around a 3D object) and apply lighting to the 
3D object. This means that you can design a label for a jelly jar and actually 
adhere it to the jar to show the client!
Here are the three choices for the 3D effect:
 
✦ Extrude & Bevel: This uses the z-axis to extrude an object. For example, 
a square becomes a cube.
 
✦ Revolve: Uses the z-axis and revolves a shape around it. You can use 
this to change an arc into a ball.
 
✦ Rotate: Rotates a 3D object created with the Extrude & Bevel or Revolve 
effects, or you can rotate a 2D object in 3D space. You can also adjust a 
3D or 2D object’s perspective.
To apply a 3D effect, you need to create an object appropriate for the 3D 
effect. The Extrude & Bevel feature works great with shapes and text. If you 
want to edit an object that already has a 3D effect applied to it, double-click 
the 3D effect in the Appearance panel.
To apply a 3D effect, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object that you want to apply the 3D effect to.
 
2. Choose Effect➪3D➪Extrude & Bevel.
 
 Options for your chosen 3D effect appear. The Extrude & Bevel Options 
dialog box is shown in Figure 12-6.

3. Select the Preview check box so that you can see results as you experi-
ment with these settings.
 
4. Click the Preview pane (which shows a cube in Figure 12-6) and drag 
to rotate your object in space.
 
 It makes selecting the right angle fun, or you can choose the angle from 
the Position drop-down list above the preview. This is called positioning 
the object in space.
 
 You should never rotate a 3D object with the Rotate tool, unless you 
want some very funky results; use the Preview pane in the Extrude & 
Bevel Options dialog box instead.
 
5. (Optional) Use the Perspective drop-down list to add additional per-
spective to your object.

& Bevel 
Options 
dialog box.
 
 
6. In the Extrude & Bevel section of the dialog box, choose a depth for 
your object and a cap.
 
 The cap determines whether your shape has a solid cap on it or whether 
it’s hollow, as shown in Figure 12-7.

7. Choose a bevel (edge shape) from the Bevel drop-down list and set the 
height using the Height drop-down list.
 
 You have a choice of two ways to apply the bevel:
 
• Bevel Extent Out: The bevel is added to the object.
 
• Bevel Extent In: The bevel is subtracted from the object.
 
8. Choose a rendering style from the Surface drop-down list or click the 
More Options button for in-depth lighting options, such as changing 
the direction or adding additional lighting.
 
9. Click the Map Art button.
 
 The Map Art dialog box opens. Use this dialog box to apply artwork to a 
3D object.
 
10. With the Surface arrow buttons, select which surface you want the 
artwork applied to and then choose a symbol from the Symbol drop-
down list, as shown in Figure 12-8.
 
 The result is shown on the bottom in Figure 12-8.
 
Keep the following points in mind when mapping artwork:
 
✦ An object must be a symbol to be used as mapped artwork. You’d 
simply need to select and drag the artwork that you want mapped to the 
Symbols panel to make it a selectable item in the Map Art dialog box.
 
✦ The light gray areas in the Preview pane are the visible areas based 
upon the object’s present position. Drag and scale the artwork in this 
pane to get the artwork where you want it.
 
✦ Shaded artwork (enabled by selecting the Shaded Artwork check box 
at the bottom of the Map Art dialog box) looks good but can take a 
long time to render.
Note: All 3D effects are rendered at 72 dpi (dots per inch; low resolution) 
so as not to slow down processing speed. You can determine the resolution 
by choosing Effect➪Document Raster Effects Settings, or when you save or 
export the file. You can also select the object and choose Object➪Rasterize. 
After the object is rasterized, it can no longer be used as an Illustrator 3D 
object, so save the original!

Adding Multiple Fills and Strokes
With the panel menu in the Appearance panel, you can add more fills and 
strokes. With this feature, you can put different colored fills on top of each 
other and individually apply effects to each one, creating really interesting 
and creative results.
Just for fun, follow along to see what you can do to a single object with the 
Appearance panel:

Adding Multiple Fills and Strokes
358
 
1. Create a star shape.
 
 It doesn’t matter how many points it has, or how large it is, just make it 
large enough to work with.
 
2. Use the Swatches panel (choose Window➪Swatches) to fill it with 
yellow and give it a black stroke.
 
3. Choose Window➪Stroke to use the Stroke panel to make the stroke 
1 pt; alternatively, choose 1 from the Stroke drop-down list in the 
Control panel.
 
 Notice that in the Appearance panel, the present fill and stroke are 
listed. Even in the simplest form, the Appearance panel helps track basic 
attributes. You can easily take advantage of the tracking to apply effects 
to just a fill or a stroke.
 
4. Click Stroke in the Appearance panel.
 
 If the Appearance panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Appearance.
 
5. Choose Effect➪Path➪Offset Path.
 
6. In the Offset Path dialog box that appears, enter –5pt in the Offset text 
box and select the Preview check box.
 
 Notice that the stroke moves into the fill instead of on the edge.
 
7. Change the offset to something that works with your star shape and 
click OK.
 
 Depending on the size of your star, you may want to adjust the amount 
of offset up or down.
 
8. From the panel menu of the Appearance panel, add an additional fill 
to the star shape.
 
 This may sound ridiculous, but you can create some super effects with 
multiple fills.
 
9. Click Fill in the Appearance panel (the top one) and choose 
Effect➪Distort and Transform➪Twist.
 
10. In the Twist dialog box that appears, type 45 into the Angle text field 
and select the Preview check box.
 
 Notice how only the second fill is twisted? Pretty neat, right?
 
11. Click OK to exit the Twist dialog box.
 
12. Select the top fill from the Appearance panel again.

 You always have to be sure that you select the fill or stroke you want 
before doing anything that’s meant to change just that specific fill or 
stroke.
 
13. In the Transparency panel (choose Window➪Transparency), choose 50% 
from the Opacity slider or simply type 50% in the Opacity text field.
 
 Now you can see your original shape through the new fill!
 
14. With that top fill still selected, change the color or choose a pattern in 
the Swatches panel for a really different appearance.
 
 You could go on for hours playing around with combinations of fills and 
strokes. Hopefully, this clicks, and you can take it further on your own.

S
o you have beautiful artwork, but you aren’t sure how to get it off your 
screen. You could have a party and invite all interested clients to stand 
around your monitor and ooh and ah, or you could actually share or sell 
your artwork by putting it on the Internet or printing it.
In this chapter, we show you how to use your illustrations in a variety of 
workflows, from using Illustrator files in page layout programs, to exporting 
files for Photoshop (and other programs) and the Web. This chapter can 
help you really use your artwork and understand the saving and flattening 
choices available in Adobe Illustrator.
Saving and Exporting Illustrator Files
In this section, we show you how the general choices in the Save As dialog 
box (choose File➪Save As) differ and the benefits of each.
When you choose File➪Save or File➪Save As, you have the choice of saving 
in the Adobe Illustrator, EPS, Template, PDF, FXG (a vector-based file format 
that describes graphical elements.), SVG Compressed, or SVG. We discuss 
all these formats throughout this chapter.
 
If you need a file format that isn’t listed in the regular Save As dialog box, 
choose File➪Export to see additional choices. With the File Export command, 
you can choose to save your files in any of the formats in Table 13-1.

Many of these formats rasterize your artwork, meaning that they’ll no longer 
maintain vector paths and the benefits of being vector. Scalability isn’t limited, 
for example. If you think that you may want to edit your image again later, be 
sure to save a copy of the file and keep the original in the .ai format.
The native Adobe Illustrator file format
If you’re working with the programs in the Creative Suite, the best way to 
save your file is as a native Illustrator .ai file. For instance, the .ai format 
works with Adobe applications such as Adobe InDesign for page layout, 
Adobe Dreamweaver for Web page creation, Adobe Photoshop for photo-
retouching, and Adobe Acrobat for cross-platform documents.
Understanding when it’s best to use the .ai format is important. Saving 
your illustration as an .ai file ensures that your file is editable; it also 
ensures that any transparency is retained, even if you use the file in another 
application.
To save and use a file in the native Illustrator format, follow these steps:
 
1. Make an illustration with transparency (50 percent transparent, for 
example) in Adobe Illustrator and choose File➪Save As.
 
2. Select Adobe Illustrator Document (.ai) from the Save as Type drop-
down list, give the file a name, and click Save.

3. Leave the Illustrator Native Options at the defaults and click OK.
 
After you follow the preceding steps to prepare your Illustrator file, you can 
use the illustration in other Adobe applications:
 
✦ Adobe Acrobat: Open the Acrobat application and choose File➪Open. 
Locate the .ai file. The native Illustrator file opens within the Acrobat 
application.
 
✦ Adobe InDesign: Choose File➪Place. This method supports transpar-
ency created in Adobe Illustrator. (However, copying and pasting from 
Illustrator to InDesign does not support transparency.) See Figure 13-1.
 
✦ Adobe Photoshop: Choose File➪Place. By placing an Illustrator file into 
Adobe Photoshop, you automatically create a Photoshop Smart Object. 
You can scale, rotate, and even apply effects to the Illustrator file and 
return to the original illustration at any time. Read more about Smart 
Objects in Photoshop in Book IV, Chapter 9.
 
 If you really want to go crazy with an Illustrator file in Photoshop, 
when you save the file in Illustrator, choose File➪Export and select the 
Photoshop (.psd) format from the Save as Type drop-down list. Choose 
a resolution from the options window. If you used layers, leave the Write 
Layers option selected.
 
 In Photoshop, choose File➪Open, select the file that you just saved in 
Illustrator as a .psd, and click Open. The file opens in Photoshop with 
the layers intact.
 
Figure 13-1: 
InDesign 
supports 
trans-
parency, 
even over 
text.
 
 
✦ Adobe Flash: New integration features built into Adobe Illustrator CS4 
allow you to cut and paste directly into Adobe Flash CS4. If you Choose 
Edit➪Copy from Adobe Illustrator, you can then switch to Adobe Flash 
CS4 and choose Edit➪Paste. The Paste dialog box appears.
 
 You can also choose File➪Import in Flash for additional import choices. 
As shown in Figure 13-2, when a native Illustrator file was selected to

Import to Stage, the Import to Stage dialog box appears (right in Flash!) 
and gives you the opportunity to import only certain layers or sublayers, 
as well as provides warning messages about incompatible objects.

offers the 
opportunity 
to select 
individual 
layers and 
sublayers 
when you

✦ Adobe Dreamweaver: By choosing File➪Save for Web & Devices, you 
can choose to save your Illustrator document in the .gif, .jpg, .png, 
.swf, .svg, or .wbmp format. You can then insert images in those 
file formats into Dreamweaver by choosing Insert➪Image in Adobe 
Dreamweaver.
 
 Click the Image button in the Insert panel in Dreamweaver. When the 
Select Image Source dialog box appears, navigate to the location where 
you saved your optimized file. Select it and click OK (Windows) or 
Choose (Mac). If your file is located out of the root folder for the site 
you’re working on, an alert window appears, offering the opportunity to 
save the file with your other site assets. See Book VI, Chapter 4 for more 
information about importing images in Dreamweaver.
Saving Illustrator files back to previous versions
When saving an .ai or .eps file, you can choose File➪Save As, choose an 
Illustrator format, and then click OK.

When the Illustrator Options dialog box appears, choose a version from the 
Version drop-down list. Keep in mind that any features specific to newer ver-
sions of Illustrator will not be supported in older file formats, so make sure 
that you save a copy and keep the original file intact. Adobe helps you under-
stand the risk of saving back to older versions by putting a warning sign next 
to the Version drop-down list and showing you specific issues with the version 
you’ve selected in the Warnings window.
The EPS file format
Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS) is the file format that most text editing 
and page layout applications accept; EPS supports vector data and is com-
pletely scalable. The Illustrator .eps format is based on PostScript, which 
means that you can reopen an EPS file and edit it in Illustrator at any time.
To save a file in Illustrator as an EPS, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As and select EPS from the Save as Type drop-down list.
 
2. From the Version drop-down list, choose the Illustrator version you’re 
saving to.
 
3. In the EPS Options dialog box that appears (as shown in Figure 13-3), 
choose the preview from the Format drop-down list:
 
• (8-Bit Color): A color preview for either Mac or PC.
 
• (Black & White): A low-resolution black-and-white preview.
 
4. Select either the Transparent or Opaque radio button, depending on 
whether you want the non-image areas in your artwork to be transpar-
ent or opaque.
 
5. Set your Transparency settings.
 
 These settings are grayed out if you haven’t used transparency in the 
file. (See the “Flattening Transparency” section, later in this chapter, for 
more about this setting.)
 
6. Leave the Embed Fonts (for Other Applications) check box selected to 
leave fonts you used embedded in the EPS file format.
 
7. In the Options section, leave the Include CMYK PostScript in RGB 
Files check box selected.
 
 If you don’t know which Adobe Postscript level you want to save to, 
leave it at the default.
 
8. Click OK to save your file as an EPS.

The PDF file format
If you want to save your file in a format that supports over a dozen platforms 
and requires only the Acrobat Reader, available as a free download at www.
adobe.com, choose to save as a PDF (Portable Document Format).
If you can open an Illustrator file in Acrobat, why would you need to save a 
file as a PDF? Well, for one thing, you can compress a PDF down to a smaller 
size; also, the receiver can double-click the file, and Acrobat or Acrobat 
Reader launches automatically.
Depending on how you save the PDF, you can allow some level of editability 
in Adobe Illustrator. To save a file as a PDF, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As, choose Illustrator PDF (.pdf) from the Save as 
Type drop-down list, and then click Save.
 
2. In the Adobe PDF Options dialog box that appears, choose one of the 
following options from the Preset drop-down list:
 
• Illustrator Default: Creates a PDF file in which all Illustrator data is 
preserved. PDF files created with this preset can be reopened in 
Illustrator without any loss of data.

Chapter 13

• High Quality Print: Creates PDFs for desktop printers and proofers.
 
• PDF/X-1a:2001: This method is the least flexible delivery of PDF con-
tent data, but it can be very powerful. It requires that the color of all 
objects be in CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) or spot colors. 
Elements in RGB (Red, Green Blue) or Lab color spaces or tagged 
with International Color Consortium (ICC) profiles are prohibited. It 
also requires that all fonts used in the job be embedded in the sup-
plied PDF file.
 
• PDF/X-3:2002: This method of creating a PDF has slightly more flex-
ibility than the X-1a:2001 method in that color managed workflows 
are supported elements in Lab, and attached ICC source profiles may 
also be used.
 
• PDF/X-4:2008: This preset is based on PDF 1.4, which includes support 
for live transparency. PDF/X-4 has the same color management and 
ICC color specifications as PDF/X-3. You can open PDF files created 
with PDF/X-4 compliance in Acrobat 7.0 and Reader 7.0 and later.
 
• Press Quality: Creates a PDF file that can be printed to a high-
resolution output device. The file will be large, but it will maintain all 
the information that a commercial printer or service provider needs 
to print your file correctly. This option automatically converts the 
color mode to CMYK, embeds all fonts used in the file, prints at a 
higher resolution, and uses other settings to preserve the maximum 
amount of information contained in the original document.
 
 Before creating an Adobe PDF file with the Press Quality preset, 
check with your commercial printer to find out what the output reso-
lution and other settings should be.
 
• Smallest File Size: Creates a low-resolution PDF suitable for posting 
on the Internet or sending via e-mail.
 
• Standard: Don’t pick a PDF/X standard unless you have a specific 
need or have been requested to. Through the Standard drop-down 
list, you can select the type of PDF/X file you want to create.
 
• Compatibility: Different features are available for different versions, 
such as the ability to support layers in Version 6 or higher. If you 
want the most compatible file type, choose Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4). But 
if you want to take advantage of layers or need to preserve spot 
colors, you must choose Acrobat 6 or higher.
 
3. Click Save PDF to save your file as a PDF.
 
 If you want to be able to reopen the PDF file and edit it in Illustrator, 
make sure that you leave the Preserve Illustrator Editing Capabilities 
check box selected in the Adobe PDF Options dialog box.

In the Adobe PDF Options dialog box, to the left of the preset choices are 
options that you can change to customize your settings. Scan through them to 
see how you can change resolution settings and even add printer’s marks. Take 
a look at Book V on Acrobat to find out more about the additional PDF options.
 
Want a Press Quality PDF but don’t want to convert all your colors to CMYK? 
Choose the Press setting and then click the Output options. In the Color 
Conversion drop-down list, select No Conversion.
Saving Your Artwork for the Web
If you need to save artwork for the Web, there’s no better feature than Save 
for Web & Devices. The Save for Web & Devices dialog box gives you a pre-
view pane where you can test different file formats before you actually save 
the file.
To save an Illustrator file that you intend to use in a Web page, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save for Web & Devices.
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears, showing your artwork 
on the Optimized tab.
 
2. Choose a tabbed view: Original, Optimized, 2-Up, or 4-Up.
 
 As a default, you see the artwork in the Optimized view, which previews 
the artwork as it will appear based upon the settings on the right. The 
2-Up view is probably the best choice because it shows your original 
image versus the optimized version.
 
3. Choose a setting for your file from the options on the right.
 
 If you want to make it easy on yourself, choose a preset from the Preset 
drop-down list. Keep in mind these points:
 
• Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is generally used for artwork with 
spans of solid color. GIF isn’t a lossy format. You can make your artwork 
smaller by reducing the number of colors in the image — hence the 
choices, such as GIF 64 No Dither (64 colors). The lower the number of 
colors, the smaller the file size. You can also increase or decrease the 
number of colors in the file by changing the preset values in the Color 
text field or by using the arrows to the left of the Color text field.
 
• Dithering tries to make your artwork look like it has more colors by 
creating a pattern in the colors. It looks like a checkerboard pattern 
up close and even far away, as shown in Figure 13-4. It also makes a 
larger file size, so why use it? Most designers don’t like the effect and 
choose the No Dither option.

Book III
Chapter 13
Using Your 
Illustrator Images
Saving Your Artwork for the Web
369
 
Figure 13-4: 
An example 
of dithering.
 
 
• Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is used for artwork that has 
subtle gradations from one shade to another. Photographs are often 
saved in this format. If you have drop shadows or blends in your 
artwork, select this format. JPEG is a lossy file format — it will reduce 
your image to a lesser quality and can create odd artifacts in your 
artwork. You have choices, such as High, Medium, and Low in the 
Settings drop-down list. Make sure that you choose wisely. You can 
also use the Quality slider to tweak the compression.
 
• PNG-8 is very similar to a GIF file format. Unless you have a certain 
reason for saving as PNG-8, stick with the GIF file format.
 
• PNG-24 supports the best of two formats (GIF and JPEG). Not only 
does the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format support the nice 
gradients from one tonal value to another (like JPEGs), but it also 
supports transparency (like GIFs). Not just any old transparency; if 
you make an object 50 percent transparent in Adobe Illustrator and 
then save it with Save for Web & Devices as a PNG-24 file with the 
Transparency check box selected, the image shows through to any 
other objects underneath it on its destination page.
 
• The Shockwave Flash (SWF) graphic file format is a version of the 
Adobe Flash Player vector-based graphics format. Because a SWF file 
is vector-based, its graphics are scalable and play back smoothly on 
any screen size and across multiple platforms. With the Save for Web 
& Devices dialog box, you can save your image directly to SWF from 
Adobe Illustrator. With the SWF choice, you can preview and make 
decisions as to how you want to export to the file as well as make 
decisions about how layers should be exported.
 
• Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an emerging Web standard for two-
dimensional graphics. SVG is written in plain text and rendered by the 
browser, except that in this case, it’s not just text that’s rendered but 
also shapes and images, which can be animated and made interac-
tive. SVG is written in XML (Extensible Markup Language). You can 
choose to save Scalable Vector Graphics out of Adobe Illustrator 
with the Save for Web & Devices dialog box.
 
• Use the Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap Format (WBMP) format 
for bitmap images for mobile devices.

4. When you’re satisfied with your chosen settings, Save.
 
When saving illustrations for the Web, keep the following points in mind, 
which make the whole process much easier for you and anyone who uses 
your illustrations:
 
✦ Keep the file size small. Don’t forget that if you’re saving illustrations 
for a Web page, many other elements will be on that page. Try to con-
serve on file size to make downloading the page quicker for viewers with 
dial-up connections. Most visitors won’t wait more than ten seconds for 
a page to download before giving up and moving on to another Web site.
 
 When you make your choices, keep an eye on the file size and the opti-
mized artwork in the lower-left corner of the preview window. On average, 
a GIF should be around 10K and a JPEG around 15K. These rules aren’t 
written in stone, but please don’t try to put a 100K JPEG on a Web page!
 
 You can change the download time by selecting the panel menu in the 
upper-right corner of the Save for Web & Devices dialog box and choos-
ing Optimize to File Size to input a final file size and have Illustrator 
create your settings in the Save for Web & Devices dialog box.
 
✦ Preview the file before saving it. If you want to see the artwork in a 
Web browser before saving it, click the Preview in Default Browser 
button at the bottom of the Save for Web & Devices dialog box. The 
browser of choice appears with your artwork in the quality and size in 
which it will appear. If you have no browser selected, click and hold 
down the Preview in Default Browser button to choose Other and then 
browse to locate a browser that you want to use for previewing. Close 
the browser to return to the Save for Web & Devices dialog box.
 
✦ Change the size. Many misconceptions abound about size when it comes 
to Web artwork. Generally, most people view their browser windows in an 
area approximately 700 x 500 pixels. Depending on the screen resolution, 
this may cover the entire screen on a 14-inch monitor, but even viewers 
with a 21-inch monitor with a high resolution often don’t want to have 
their entire screen covered with a browser’s window, so they still have a 
browser window area of around 700 x 500 pixels. When choosing a size for 
your artwork, use proportions of this amount to help you. For example, 
if you want an illustration to take up about a quarter of the browser win-
dow’s width, make your image about 175 pixels wide (700÷4 = 175). If you 
notice that the height of your image is over 500 pixels, whittle the height 
down in size as well, or your viewers will have to scroll to see the whole 
image (and it will probably take too long to download!).
 
 Use the Image Size tab to input new sizes. As long as the Constrain 
Proportions check box is selected, both the height and width of the 
image will be changed proportionally. Click the Apply button to change 
the size but don’t close the Save for Web & Devices dialog box.

✦ Finish the save. If you aren’t finished with the artwork but want to save 
the settings, hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key and 
click the Remember button. (When you’re not holding down the Alt or 
Option key, the Remember button is the Done button.) If you’re finished, 
click the Save button and save your file in the appropriate location.
Flattening Transparency
You may find that all those cool effects that you put into your illustration 
don’t print correctly. When you print a file that has effects, such as drop shad-
ows, cool gradient blends, and feathering, Illustrator turns transparent areas 
that overlap other objects into pixels and leaves what it can as vectors — this 
process is flattening.
So what actually is flattening? Look at Figure 13-5 to see the difference 
between the original artwork (on the left) and the flattened artwork (on the 
right). Notice that in Figure 13-5, when the artwork was flattened, some of 
the areas turned into pixels. But at what resolution? This is why you want to 
know about flattening so that you can determine the quality of art — before 
getting an unpleasant surprise at the outcome.

Flattening a file
If you’ve taken advantage of transparency or effects using transparency 
(which we discuss in Chapter 11 of this minibook), follow these steps to get 
the highest quality artwork from your file:
 
1. Make sure that you’ve created the artwork in the CMYK mode.
 
 You can change the document’s color mode by choosing File➪Document 
Color Mode.

Flattening Transparency
372
 
2. Choose Effects➪Document Raster Effects Settings.
 
 The Document Raster Effects Settings dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 13-6.
 
3. Choose the resolution that you want to use by selecting an option in 
the Resolution area.
 
 Select Screen (72 ppi) option, for web graphics,. Medium (150 ppi) for 
desktop printers and copiers, and High (300 ppi) for graphics that will 
be printed on a press.
 
4. Choose whether you want a white or transparent background.
 
 If you select the Transparent option, you create an alpha channel. The 
alpha channel is retained if the artwork is exported into Photoshop.
 
5. You can generally leave the items in the Options section deselected:
 
• The Anti-Alias check box applies anti-aliasing to reduce the appear-
ance of jagged edges in the rasterized image. Deselect this option to 
maintain the crispness of fine lines and small text.
 
• The Create Clipping Mask check box creates a mask that makes the 
background of the rasterized image appear transparent. You don’t 
need to create a clipping mask if you select the Transparent option 
for your background.
 
• The Add around Object text field adds the specified number of pixels 
around the rasterized image.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The next step is to set the transparency options in the Document Setup 
dialog box.

7. Choose File➪Document Setup.
 
 From the Transparency section in the middle of the dialog box, click 
the Preset drop-down list and select the Low, Medium, High, or Custom 
option. Select the Low option for on-screen viewing, the Medium option 
for printers and copiers, or the High option for press. Click the Custom 
button to the right of the drop-down list if you want to control more of 
the settings.
 
8. Click OK.
 
If you find yourself customizing the settings on a regular basis, choose Edit➪
Transparency Flattener Presets to create and store your own presets.
You can apply the flattening in several ways. Here are three simple methods.
 
✦ Select the object(s) that requires flattening and choose Object➪Flatten 
Transparency. Choose one of the default settings or a custom preset 
that you created from the Preset drop-down list and click OK.
 
✦ Choose File➪Print and select Advanced from the list of print options 
on the left. Choose a preset from the Overprint and Transparency 
Flattener options. If you used the Attributes panel to create overprints 
(for trapping used in high-end printing), make sure that you preserve 
the overprints.
 
 Note: Overprints aren’t preserved in areas that use transparency.
 
✦ Choose File➪Save As and choose Illustrator EPS. In the Transparency 
section of the EPS Options dialog box, choose a flattening setting from 
the Preset drop-down list. If your Transparency options are grayed out, 
you have no transparency in your file.
Using the Flattener Preview panel
Want to preview your flattening? Use the Flattener Preview panel by choos-
ing Window➪Flattener Preview.
The Flattener Preview panel doesn’t apply the flattening, but it gives you 
a preview based upon your settings. Click the Refresh button and choose 
Show Options from the panel menu. Test various settings without actually 
flattening the file. Experiment with different settings and then save your 
presets by selecting Save Transparency Flattener Preset from the panel 
menu. The saved settings can be accessed in the Preset drop-down list in 
the Options dialog boxes that appear when you save a file as an EPS or in the 
Document Setup dialog box.
 
Click the Refresh button after making changes to update the preview.

Zoom in on the artwork by clicking in the preview pane. Scroll the artwork in 
the preview pane by holding down the spacebar and dragging. Zoom out by 
Alt+clicking (Windows) or Option+clicking (Mac).
Printing from Illustrator
Printing from Illustrator gives you lots of capabilities, such as printing com-
posites to separations and adding printer’s marks.
To print your illustration, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Print.
 
2. In the Print dialog box that appears, select a printer if one isn’t 
already selected.
 
3. If the PPD isn’t selected, choose one from the PPD drop-down list.
 
 A PPD is a printer description file. Illustrator needs this to determine 
the specifics of the PostScript printer you’re sending your file to. This 
setting lets Illustrator know whether the printer can print in color, 
the paper size it can handle, and the resolution, as well as many other 
important details.
 
4. Choose from other options as follows:
 
 Use the General options area to pick what pages to print. In the Media 
area, select the size of media that you’re printing to. In the Options area, 
choose whether you want layers to print and any options specific to 
printing layers.
 
5. Click the Print button to print your illustration.
And that’s it. Printing your illustration can be really simple, but the following 
list highlights some basic things to keep in mind as you prepare your illus-
tration for printing:
 
✦ Printing a composite: A composite is the full-color image, where all the 
inks are applied to the page (and not separated out onto individual 
pages — one for cyan, one for magenta, one for yellow, and one for 
black). To make sure that your settings are correct, click Output in the 
print options pane on the left side of the Print dialog box and select 
Composite from the Mode drop-down list.
 
✦ Printing separations: To separate colors, click Output in the print 
options pane on the left side of the Print dialog box; from the Mode 
drop-down list, choose the Separations (Host-Based) option. Select the 
In-RIP Separations option only if your service provider or printer asks 
you to. Other options to select from are as follows:

• The resolution is determined by your PPD, based upon the dots per 
inch (dpi) in the printer description. You may have only one option 
available in the Printer Resolution drop-down list.
 
• Select the Convert Spot Colors to Process check box to make your 
file 4-color.
 
• Click the printer icons to the left of the listed colors to turn off or on 
the colors that you want to print.
 
✦ Printer’s marks and bleeds: Click Marks and Bleeds in the print options 
pane on the left side of the Print dialog box to turn on all printer’s 
marks, or just select the ones that you want to appear.
 
 Specify a bleed area if you’re extending images beyond the trim area of 
a page. If you don’t specify a bleed, the artwork stops at the edge of the 
page and doesn’t leave a trim area for the printer.
 
After you create a good set of options specific to your needs, click the Save 
Preset. Name your preset appropriately; when you want to use that preset, 
select it from the Print Preset drop-down list at the top of the Print dialog 
box for future print jobs.

Chapter 1: Exploring New Features 
in Photoshop CS4
In This Chapter
✓ Working with the improved panel workspace
✓ Experimenting with nondestructive adjustment layers
✓ Experimenting with 3D
P
hotoshop CS4 includes significant improvements to the workspace, 
editing tools, and 3D tools. In this chapter, you take a quick tour of 
some of the most exciting new capabilities. The features you see depend on 
the version of Photoshop CS4 that you have (Standard or Extended).
This quick rundown of what’s new and exciting in Photoshop CS4 is a help 
to you when you start experimenting with the new tools and features.
 
If you really want to dive into the new features, choose Window➪
Workspace➪What’s New in CS4. Instantly, all the new features are high-
lighted in the menus! (We have to say that not all the highlighted features 
are totally new — many existed in CS3. Maybe Adobe thinks that users 
missed them!)
An Improved Workspace Helps 
You Find the Tools You Need
You have to give it to the Adobe Photoshop engineers; they hear the pleas 
of the average users and they’re trying to help. Help with what you ask? 
Understanding the Photoshop terminology and unique names of their tools 
and controls. Many people who have been using Photoshop for years feel 
quite at ease with the unique terminology, but new users seem to have a 
more difficult time finding the tools and options that they want to use.
Palettes are now panels, like the rest of the CS4 applications. The panels are 
collapsed to a compact view and represented by space-saving icons. This 
workspace makes focusing on the images easier, and the tools become a 
natural extension of your work.
Photoshop continues to make extensive use of panels. To activate a panel 
in this new version, simply click the appropriate panel icon. If you select 
another panel icon, its panel is brought to the front of the display. You can 

Adjustments Panel

return panels to icons by clicking the Collapse to Icons bar at the top of 
the panel docking area. When an icon is dragged to the work area, it auto-
matically expands and then returns to an icon when dragged back into the 
docking area.
Showing and hiding all your tools and panels is easy. Press the Tab key to 
hide all your tools and panels. To cause them to reappear, move your cursor 
over the left or right side of your screen and pause when you see the vertical 
gray bar appear — the toolbar or panels then appear!
Other improvements to the workspace include
 
✦ Tool options are easier to find. This is partly because some of the tools 
and panels now have relevant names. For example, the Control palette 
in earlier versions is now more appropriately the Options panel. If you 
want to make your brush bigger or smaller, or change the color of your 
text, simply choose Window➪Options.
 
✦ You can change the one-column toolbar to two columns by clicking 
the gray bar at the top of the toolbar.
 
✦ You can select layer features, such as Auto Align and Auto Blend 
right from the Layer menu (choose Layer➪Auto Align or Layer➪
Auto Blend).
Adjustments Panel
The new Adjustments panel makes non-destructive editing changes quick 
and easy. Use the new Adjustments panel to apply one new adjustment layer 
after another to your image, without affecting the original image. Adjustment 
layers have been a fabulous feature that’s existed in the last several versions 
of Photoshop. Far too few people seem to take advantage of them, but 
when you do, it’ll be hard to imagine using any other method to change 
your image.
Here’s an overview of how to use the new Adjustments panel in 
Photoshop CS4:
 
1. Open an image in Photoshop.
 
2. If the Layers panel isn’t open, choose Windows➪Layers.
 
3. Click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer button, and select 
an adjustment that you want to apply to the active layer (which can 
also include the layers below), as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
 The Adjustments panel appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
 For this example, the Black & White adjustment was selected because it 
shows a drastic change to the underlying layers,

panel.
 
 
4. Choose a preset from the Preset drop-down list or make your changes 
with the sliders.
 
 A new adjustment layer is added on top of the last active layer.
 
 To experiment with color to black-and-white conversions, click your image 
or a color that you want to appear lighter (when converted to black and 
white) and then drag to the right. Click a color that you want to appear 
darker and then drag to the left. Photoshop figures out what sliders need to 
be adjusted automatically!

Make Your Layers Go 3D!

Adjustment layers affect only the layers beneath them in the layer 
stacking order.
Turn off the visibility icon to the left of the new adjustment layer in the 
Layers panel, and the adjustment no longer occurs. Double-click the 
adjustment layer, and the Layer Style dialog box appears so that you can 
make changes. Drag the adjustment layer to the trash can, and it’s like 
you never did anything to the image.
Make Your Layers Go 3D!
In earlier versions of Photoshop, you could open and make some slight edit-
ing changes on 3D files. Now, in CS4 you not only can open 3D files, but you 
can also take standard layers in Photoshop and convert them to 3D layers. 
This gives you the opportunity to convert virtually anything into a 3D image.
To experiment, open any image in Photoshop to experiment with the 
different methods of converting to 3D layers. Choose 3D➪Create 3D Shape 
and then choose a method. For example, the image in Figure 4-3 was 
created by choosing 3D➪Create 3D Shape➪Soda Can. This method wraps 
your image around a soda can!
Rotate and revolve your 3D layer by using two new tools that are added to 
the toolbar — the 3D Rotate and 3D Orbit tools, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
By double-clicking the icon in the 3D layer in the Layers panel, you can edit 
the 3D layer, and experiment with different texture and lighting rendering 
methods.

We could write an entire book on just the new 3D options, but the reality 
is that for the scope of this book, we’ll just have to recommend that you 
experiment . . . a lot! The 3D options are definitely worthy new features.
Kuler System Comes to Photoshop
Advanced color users in Illustrator could take advantage of the Kuler feature 
since CS3, but now Photoshop can use this incredible color themed-based 
application. With Kuler, you can easily generate color combinations to 
experiment and apply to your artwork. Whether you’re creating Web sites, 
brochures, patterns, or logos, you can experiment quickly with color 
variations.
ConnectNow
Adobe ConnectNow is a free Web conferencing solution that allows users 
to share ideas, discuss details, and complete work together while online. 
By choosing File➪Share Your Screen, you can collaborate through chat, a 
whiteboard, and a shared notes Connections panel.

N
avigating the work area in Photoshop can be slightly cumbersome at 
first, especially if you’ve never worked in a program that relies so 
heavily on panels. In this chapter, we introduce you to Photoshop CS4. We 
introduce you to the work area, show you what the Photoshop CS4 tools are 
all about, and reveal how to neatly organize and hide panels. We also show 
you how to do basic tasks, such as opening, cropping, and saving an image.
Getting to Know the Tools
Tools are used to create, select, and manipulate objects in Photoshop CS4. 
When you open Photoshop, the Tools panel appears along the left edge 
of the workspace (see Figure 2-1), and panels appear on the right side of 
the screen. (We discuss panels in the upcoming section, “Navigating the 
Work Area.”)
 
In the Tools panel, look for the name of the tool to appear in a ToolTip when 
you hover the cursor over the tool. Following the tool name is a letter in 
parentheses, which is the keyboard shortcut command that you can use to 
access that tool. Simply press the Shift key along with the key command you 
see to access any hidden tools. In other words, pressing P activates the Pen 
tool, and pressing Shift+P activates the hidden tools under the Pen tool in 
the order that they appear. When you see a small triangle at the lower-right 
corner of the tool icon, you know that this tool contains hidden tools.

Navigating the Work Area
Getting around in Photoshop isn’t much different from getting around in 
other Adobe applications. All Adobe applications make extensive use of 
panels, for example. In the following sections, we cover the highlights on 
navigating in Photoshop.
Docking and saving panels
Panels, panels everywhere . . . do you really need them all? Maybe not just 
yet, but when you increase your skill level, you’ll take advantage of most 
(if not all) of the Photoshop panels. The panels give you easy access to 
important functions. Book I, Chapter 3 provides a lot of basic information 
about using panels in the Adobe Creative Suite, so check out that chapter 
if you need a refresher on using panels. We add only a few things here that 
are specific to using the panels in Photoshop.
 
When you work in Photoshop, keep in mind these two key commands:
 
✦ Press Tab to switch between hiding and showing the tools and panels.
 
✦ Press Shift+Tab to hide the panels, leaving only the Tools panel visible.
If you find that you’re always using the same panels, hide the panels that you 
don’t need and arrange your other panels on-screen where you want them. 
Then follow these steps to save that panel configuration:
 
1. Choose Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace.
 
2. In the Save Workspace dialog box that appears, name your workspace 
and click Save.
 
3. Any time you want the panels to return to your saved locations, 
choose Window➪Workspace➪Name of Your Workspace (where 
Name of Your Workspace is the name you supplied in Step 2).
 
Choose Window➪Workspace➪Reset Panel Locations to put the panels back 
in the same order they were upon the initial installation.
Taking advantage of new workspace features
Photoshop CS4 includes many new saved workspaces that you can take 
advantage of to streamline workspaces and open the panels you need for 
specific tasks. These new workspaces include those that can be used for 
Web design, painting and retouching, and color and tonal correction, to 
name a few.

Navigating the Work Area
389
Increase your work area by turning your panels into icons, as shown in 
Figure 2-2. Do so by either right-clicking the tab of a panel and selecting 
Collapse to Icons or clicking the Auto Collapse gray bar at the top of the 
panel drawer. Yes, you read it correctly — the area where the panels are 
located is actually a drawer that can be adjusted in or out by clicking and 
dragging on the vertical pane to the left of the panels.

Zooming in to get a better look
What looks fine at one zoom level may actually look very bad at another. 
You’ll find yourself zooming in and out quite often while you work on an 
image in Photoshop. You can find menu choices for zooming in the View 
menu; a quicker way to zoom is to use the keyboard commands listed in 
Table 2-2.

Choosing Your Screen Mode
390
Here are a few things to keep in mind while you work with the Zoom tool to 
get a better look at your work:
 
✦ 100-percent view: Double-clicking the Zoom tool in the Tools panel 
puts you at 100-percent view. Do this before using filters to see a more 
realistic result of your changes.
 
✦ Zoom marquee: Drag from the upper left to the lower right of the area 
you want to zoom to. While dragging, a marquee appears; when you 
release the mouse button, the marqueed area zooms up to fill the image 
window. The Zoom marquee gives you much more control than just 
clicking the image with the Zoom tool. Zoom out again to see the entire 
image by pressing Ctrl+0 (Windows) or Ô+0 (Mac). Doing so fits the 
entire image in the viewing area.
 
✦ Zoom with the keyboard shortcuts: If you have a dialog box open and 
you need to reposition or zoom to a new location on your image, you 
can use the keyboard commands without exiting the dialog box.
 
✦ A new window for a different look: Choose Window➪Arrange➪New 
Window to create an additional window for your front-most image. This 
technique is helpful when you want to see the entire image (say, at 
actual size) to see the results as a whole, yet zoom in to focus on a small 
area of the image to do some fine-tuning. The new window is linked 
dynamically to the original window so that when you make changes, 
the original and any other new windows created from the original are 
immediately updated.
 
✦ Cycle through images: Press Ctrl+Tab (Windows) or Ô+Tab (Mac) to 
cycle through open images.
Choosing Your Screen Mode
You have a choice of three screen modes in which to work. Most users start 
and stay in the default (standard screen mode) until they accidentally end 
up in another. The modes are
 
✦ Standard mode is the typical view, where you have an image window 
open but can see your desktop and other images open behind.
 
✦ Maximized screen mode displays a maximized document window that 
fills all available space between docks and that resizes when dock 
widths change.
 
✦ Full-screen mode with menu view surrounds the image out to the edge 
of the work area with a neutral gray. This mode not only prevents you 
from accidentally clicking out of an image and leaving Photoshop, but 
also from seeing other images behind your working image.

✦ Full-screen mode, no menu is a favorite with multimedia types. This 
mode shows your image surrounded by black and also eliminates the 
menu items from the top of the window. Press Tab to hide all tools, and 
you have a very clean work environment.
Getting Started with Basic Tasks in Photoshop CS4
Unless you use Photoshop as a blank canvas for painting, you may rarely 
create a new file in Photoshop. This is because you usually have a source 
image that you start with. This image may have been generated by a 
scanner, digital camera, or stock image library.
The following sections show you how to open an existing image file in 
Photoshop, create a new image (if you want to use Photoshop to paint, for 
example), crop an image, and save your edited image.
Opening an image
You can open existing Photoshop images by choosing File➪Open, selecting 
the file in the Open dialog box, and then clicking the Open button.
You can also open your file by choosing File➪Browse. By selecting Browse 
instead of Open, you launch the Adobe Bridge application. Read more about 
Adobe Bridge later in this section and also in Book I, Chapter 5.
 
Photoshop can open a multitude of file formats, even if the image was 
created in another application, such as Illustrator or another image-editing 
program, but you have to open the image in Photoshop by choosing File➪
Open, or with Adobe Bridge, you can select an image and drag it to the 
Photoshop icon in the taskbar (Windows) or Dock (Mac). If you double-click 
an image file (one that wasn’t originally created in Photoshop, or from 
different versions) in a directory, the image may open only in a preview 
application.
If you’re opening a folder of images that you want to investigate first, choose 
File➪Browse to open Adobe Bridge, the control center for Adobe Creative

Creating a new file
If you’re creating a new file, you may be doing so to create a composite of 
existing files or to start with a blank canvas because you’re super creative.
If you haven’t discovered the Camera Raw 
capabilities in Adobe Photoshop, you’ll want 
to give them a try. Camera Raw is a format 
available for image capture in many cameras. 
Simply choose the format in your camera’s 
settings as Raw instead of JPEG or TIFF. These 
Raw files are a bit larger than the standard 
JPEG files, but you capture an enormous 
amount of data with the image that you can 
retrieve upon opening. (See www.adobe.
com for a complete list of cameras supporting 
Camera Raw.)
A Camera Raw file contains unprocessed pic-
ture data from a digital camera’s image sensor, 
along with information about how the image 
was captured, such as the camera and lens 
used, the exposure settings, and the white 
balance setting. When you open the file in 
Adobe Photoshop CS4, the built-in Camera 
Raw plug-in interprets the Raw file on your 
computer, making adjustments for image color 
and tonal scale.
When you shoot JPEG images with your 
camera, you’re locked into the processing done 
by your camera, but working with Camera Raw 
files gives you maximum control over your 
image, such as controlling the white balance, 
tonal range, contrast, color saturation, and 
image sharpening. Cameras that can shoot in 
Raw format have a setting on the camera that 
changes its capture mode to Raw. Instead of 
writing a final JPEG, a Raw data file is written, 
which consists of black-and-white brightness 
levels from each of the several million pixel 
sites on the imaging sensor. The actual image 
hasn’t yet been produced, and unless you have 
specific software, such as the plug-in built into 
Adobe Photoshop, opening the file can be very 
difficult, if not impossible.
To open a Camera Raw file, simply choose 
File➪Browse. Adobe Bridge opens, and you 
see several panels, including the Folders, 
Content, Preview, and Metadata panels. With 
the Folders panel, navigate to the location on 
your computer where you’ve saved your 
Camera Raw images; thumbnail previews 
appear in the Content panel. Think of Camera 
Raw files as your photo negative. You can 
reprocess the file at any time to achieve the 
results you want.
Starting in Photoshop CS3, you can right-click 
(Windows) or Control+click (Mac) a JPEG or 
TIFF file and choose Open in Camera Raw 
from the contextual menu. This is a great 
way to experiment with all the cool features 
that are available with this plug-in, but your 
results aren’t as good as if you used an actual 
Raw file.
If Adobe Photoshop CS4 doesn’t open your 
Raw file, you may need to update your Raw 
plug-in. (See www.adobe.com for the latest 
plug-in.) The plug-in should be downloaded 
and placed in this location in Windows: C:\
Program Files\Common Files\
Adobe\Plug-Ins\CS4\File Formats, 
and this location on the Macintosh: Library\
Application Support\Adobe\Plug-
Ins\CS4\File Formats.

For whatever reason, note that when you choose File➪New, you have a 
multitude of basic format choices that you can select from the Preset menu. 
They range from basic sizes and resolutions, such as U.S. Paper or Photo, to 
other final output such as the Web, Mobile Devices, or Film.
Keep in mind that you’re determining not only size but also resolution in 
your new file. If your new file is to contain images from other files, make 
sure the new file is the same resolution. Otherwise, you may get unexpected 
size results when cutting and pasting or dragging images into your new file. 
Choose Image➪Image Size to see the document dimensions.
Cropping an image
A simple but essential task is to crop your image. Cropping means to 
eliminate all that isn’t important to the composition of your image.
Cropping is especially important in Photoshop. Each pixel, no matter what 
color, takes up the same amount of information, so cropping eliminates 
unneeded pixels and saves on file size and processing time. Because of that, 
you want to crop your image before you start working on it.
You can crop an image in Photoshop CS4 in two ways:
 
✦ Use the Crop tool.
 
✦ Select an area with the Marquee tool and choose Image➪Crop.
To crop an image by using the Crop tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Press C to access the Crop tool and drag around the area of the image 
that you want to crop to.
 
2. If you need to adjust the crop area, drag the handles in the crop-
bounding area.
 
3. When you’re satisfied with the crop-bounding area, double-click in the 
center of the crop area or press the Return or Enter key to crop the 
image.
 
4. If you want to cancel the crop, press the Esc key.
 
Ever scan in an image crooked? When using the Crop tool, if you position the 
cursor outside any of the handles, a rotate symbol appears. Drag the crop-
bounding area to rotate it and line it up how you want it cropped. When you 
press Return or Enter, the image is straightened out.

Saving images
Save an image file by choosing File➪Save. If you’re saving the file for the first 
time, the Save As dialog box appears. Notice in the Format drop-down list 
that you have plenty of choices for file formats. The different file formats are 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 10 of this minibook. You can always play 
it safe by choosing the Photoshop (PSD) file format. The native Photoshop 
format supports all features in Photoshop. Choosing some of the other 
formats may eliminate layers, channels, and other special features.
Many users choose to save a native Photoshop file as a backup to any other 
file formats. It’s especially important to have a backup or original file 
saved as a native Photoshop file (PSD) when you increase in capabilities 
and start taking advantage of layers and the other great capabilities of 
Photoshop. Keep in mind that as a Creative Suite user, the native file 
format for Photoshop (.psd) can be used in all the other Creative Suite 
applications.

Chapter 3: Messing 
with Mode Matters
In This Chapter

✓ Understanding Photoshop image modes
✓ Working in black and white, RGB, or CMYK
B
efore diving into Photoshop, you must know what image mode you 
should be working in and how important color settings are. So no 
matter whether you’re doing a one-color newsletter, a full-color logo, or 
something in between, this chapter can help you create much better 
imagery for both the Web and print.
Working with Bitmap Images
You may have already discovered that Photoshop works a little differently 
than most other applications. In order to create those smooth gradations 
from one color to the next, Photoshop takes advantage of pixels. Bitmap 
images (or raster images) are based on a grid of pixels. The grid is smaller or 
larger depending on the resolution that you’re working in. The number of 
pixels along the height and width of a bitmap image are the pixel dimen-
sions of an image, which are measured in pixels per inch (ppi). The more 
pixels per inch, the more detail in the image.
Unlike vector graphics (mathematically created paths), bitmap images can’t 
be scaled without losing detail. (See Figure 3-1 for an example of a bitmap 
image and a vector graphic.) Generally, it’s best to use bitmap images at or 
close to the size that you need. If you resize a bitmap image, it can become 
jagged on the edges of sharp objects. On the other hand, you can scale 
vector graphics and edit them without degrading the sharp edges.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Bitmap 
versus 
vector.
 

Choosing the Correct Photoshop Mode
396
Photoshop has the capability to work on both bitmap and vector art. 
(See the path line around the vector shape layer and notice that the path 
isn’t pixilated.) It gives you, as a designer, incredible opportunities when 
combining the two technologies.
 
For information on changing and adjusting image resolution, see Chapter 6 
of this minibook.
Choosing the Correct Photoshop Mode
Choose Image➪Mode to view the image mode choices you can choose from. 
Selecting the right one for an image is important because each mode offers 
different capabilities and results. For example, if you choose the Bitmap 
mode, you can work only in black and white . . . that’s it. No shades of color, 
not even gray. Most features are disabled in this Bitmap mode. This is fine if 
you’re working on art for a black-and-white logo, but not for most images. If, 
instead, you work in the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) mode, you have full access 
to Photoshop’s capabilities. Read on to see what image mode is best for 
your needs. When you’re ready to make your mode selection, open a file and 
choose a selection from Image➪Mode. You can read descriptions of each 
image mode in the following sections.
Along with a description of each image mode, we include a figure showing 
the Channels panel set to that mode. A channel is simply the information 
about color elements in the image. The number of default color channels in 
an image depends on its color mode. For example, a CMYK image has at 
least four channels — one each for cyan, magenta, yellow, and black infor-
mation. Grayscale has one channel. If you understand the printing process, 
think of each channel representing a plate (color) that, when combined, 
creates the final image.
Bitmap
Bitmap mode offers little more than the ability to work in black and white. 
Many tools are unusable, and most menu options are grayed out in this 
mode. If you’re converting an image to bitmap, you must convert it to 
grayscale first.
Grayscale
Use Grayscale mode, as shown in Figure 3-2, if you’re creating black-and-
white images with tonal values, specifically for printing to one color. 
Grayscale mode supports 256 shades of gray in the 8-bit color mode. 
Photoshop can work with grayscale in 16-bit mode, which provides more 
information, but may limit your capabilities when working in Photoshop.

Book IV

When you choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale to convert to Grayscale mode, 
you get a warning message confirming that you want to discard all color 
information. If you don’t want to see this warning every time you convert an 
image to grayscale, select the option to not show the dialog box again before 
you click Discard.
 
Using the Black & White adjustment is the best way to get a good grayscale 
image. Simply click and hold on the Create New Fill or adjustment button at 
the bottom of the Layers panel and choose Black & White. Set the sliders to 
achieve the best black-and-white image and then choose Image➪Mode➪
Grayscale.
 
Figure 3-2: 
Grayscale 
supports 256 
shades of 
gray.
 
Duotone
Use Duotone mode when you’re creating a one- to four-color image created 
from spot colors (solid ink, such as Pantone colors). You can also use the 
Duotone mode to create Monotones, Tritones, and Quadtones. If you’re pro-
ducing a two-color job, duotones create a beautiful solution to not having 
full color.
 
The Pantone Matching color system helps to keep printing inks consistent 
from one job to the next. By assigning a numbered Pantone color, such as 
485 for red, you don’t risk one vendor (printer) using fire-engine red and the 
next using orange-red for your company logo.
To create a Duotone, follow these steps:

Choosing the Correct Photoshop Mode
398
 
1. Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale.
 
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪Duotone.
 
3. In the Duotone dialog box, choose Duotone from the Type drop-
down list.
 
 Your choices range from Monotone (one-color) up to Quadtone (four-
color). Black is assigned automatically as the first ink, but you can 
change that if you like.
 
4. To assign a second ink color, click the white swatch immediately 
under the black swatch to open the Color Libraries dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 3-3.
 
5. Now comes the fun part: Type (quickly!) the Pantone or PMS number 
that you want to access and then click OK.
 
 There’s no text field for you to enter the number in, so don’t look for 
one. Just type the number while the Color Libraries dialog box is open.
 
 Try entering 300 for an easy one. That selects PMS 300. You can already 
see that you’ve created a tone curve.
 
6. Click the Curve button to the left of the ink color to further tweak 
the colors.
 
7. Click and drag the curve to adjust the black in the shadow areas, 
perhaps to bring down the color overall; experiment with the results.
 
8. (Optional) If you like your Duotone settings, store them by clicking the 
Save button.
 
 Click the Load button to find your customized presets and to find preset 
Duotones, Tritones, and Quadtones supplied to you by Adobe.
 
 Duotone images must be saved in the Photoshop Encapsulated 
PostScript (EPS) format in order to support the spot colors. If you chose 
another format, you risk the possibility of converting your colors into a 
build of CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black).

9. Click OK when you’re finished.
Index color
You may not work in Index color, but you probably have saved a file in this 
mode. The Indexed Color mode (see Figure 3-4) uses a color look-up table 
(CLUT) in order to create the image.
A CLUT contains all the colors that make up your image, such as a box of 
crayons used to create artwork. If you have a box of eight crayons and 
only those crayons are used to color an image, you have a CLUT of only 
eight colors. Of course, your image would look much better if you used 
the 64-count box of crayons with the sharpener on the back, but those 
additional colors increase the size of the CLUT and the file size.
The most colors that can be in index mode are 256. When saving Web 
images, you often have to define a color table. We discuss the Save for Web 
& Devices feature (which helps you to more accurately save an index color 
image) in Chapter 10 of this minibook.
 
Choose Image➪Mode➪Color Table to see the color table making up 
an image.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Index 
color uses 
a limited 
number of 
colors to 
create an 
image.
 
RGB
RGB (Red, Green, Blue), as shown in Figure 3-5, is the standard format that 
you work in if you import images from a digital camera or you scan images 
on a scanner in RGB mode. For complete access to features, RGB is probably 
the best color mode to work in. If you’re working on images for use on the 
Web, color copiers, desktop color printers, and on-screen presentations, 
stay in the RGB mode.

Choosing the Correct Photoshop Mode
400
 
Figure 3-5: 
RGB creates 
the image 
from red, 
green, and 
blue.
 
If you’re having your image printed on a press (for example, if you’re having 
the image professionally printed), it must be separated. Don’t convert 
images to CMYK mode until you’re finished with the color correction and 
you know that your color settings are accurate. A good print service may 
want the RGB file so that it can do an accurate conversion.
CMYK
CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) is the mode used for final separations 
for the press. Use a good magnifying glass to look closely at anything that 
has been printed in color, and you may see the CMYK colors that created it. 
A typical four-color printing press has a plate for each color and runs the 
colors in the order of cyan, magenta, yellow, and then black.
 
Don’t take converting an image into this mode lightly. You need to make 
decisions when you convert an image to CMYK, such as where the file will 
be printed and on what paper stock, so that the resulting image is the best 
it can be. Talk to your print provider for specifications that are important 
when converting to CMYK mode.
Lab color
Lab (Lightness, A channel, and B channel) is a color mode that many high-
end color professionals use because of its wide color range. With Lab, you 
can make adjustments to luminosity (lightness) without affecting the color. 
In this mode, you can select and change an L (Lightness or Luminosity) 
channel without affecting the A channel (green and red) and the B channel 
(blue and yellow).
Lab mode is also a good mode to use if you’re in a color-managed environ-
ment and want to easily move from one color system to another with no loss 
of color.
 
Some professionals prefer to sharpen their images in Lab mode because 
they can select just the Lightness channel and choose Filter➪Sharpen➪
Unsharp Mask to sharpen only the gray matter of the image, leaving the 
color noise-free.

Multichannel
Multichannel is used for many things; sometimes you end up in this mode, 
and you’re not quite sure how you got there. Deleting a channel from an 
RGB, CMYK, or Lab image automatically converts the image to Multichannel 
mode. This mode supports multiple spot colors.
Bit depth
You have more functionality in 16-bit and even 32-bit mode. Depending upon 
your needs, you may spend most of your time in 8-bit mode, which is more 
than likely all that you need.
Bit depth, or pixel depth or color depth, measures how much color informa-
tion is available to display or print each pixel in an image. Greater bit depth 
means more available colors and more accurate color representation in the 
digital image. In Photoshop, this increase in accuracy does also limit some of 
the features available, so don’t use it unless you have a specific request or 
need for it.
To use 16-bit or 32-bit color mode, you also must have a source to provide 
you with that information, such as a scanner or camera that offers a choice 
to scan at 16-bit or 32-bit.

Chapter 4: Creating a Selection
In This Chapter
✓ Discovering the selection tools
✓ Painting selections the easy way
✓ Giving transformed selections a try
✓ Feathering away
✓ Keeping selections for later use
✓ Using the Vanishing Point feature
U
sing Photoshop to create compositions that may not actually exist 
and retouching images to improve them is common. What you don’t 
want is obvious retouching or a composition that looks contrived. (The 
exception is if you intend an image to be humorous, such as putting baby 
Joey’s head on Daddy’s body.)
That’s where the selection tools come in. In this chapter, you discover 
several selection methods and how to use the selection tools to make your 
images look as though you haven’t retouched or edited them. Even if you’re 
an experienced Photoshop user, this chapter provides a plethora of tips and 
tricks that can save you time and help make your images look absolutely 
convincing.
Getting to Know the Selection Tools
You create selections with the selection tools. Think of selections as 
windows in which you can make changes to the pixels. Areas that aren’t 
selected are masked, which means that these unselected areas are 
unaffected by changes, much like when you tape around windows and 
doors before you paint the walls. In this section, we briefly describe the 
selection tools and show you how to use them. You must be familiar with 
these tools in order to do anything in Photoshop.
 
As with all the Photoshop tools, the Options bar (viewed across the top of 
the Photoshop window) change when you choose different selection tools. 
The keyboard commands you read about in this section exist on the tool 
Options bar and appear as buttons across the top.

Getting to Know the Selection Tools
404
 
 If you move a selection with the Move tool, pixels move as you drag, leaving 
a blank spot in the image. To clone a selection (that is, to copy and move the 
selection at the same time), Alt+drag (Windows) or Option+drag (Mac) the 
selection with the Move tool.
The Marquee tool
 
 The Marquee tool is the main selection tool; by that, we mean that you’ll use 
it most often for creating selections. The exception, of course, is when you 
have a special situation that calls for a special tool — the Lasso, Magic Wand 
tool, or the new Quick Selection tool. Throughout this section, we describe 
creating (and then deselecting) an active selection area; we also provide you 
with tips for working with selections.
The Marquee tool includes the Rectangular Marquee (for creating rectangu-
lar selections), Elliptical Marquee (for creating round or elliptical selec-
tions), and Single Row Marquee or Single Column Marquee tools (for 
creating a selection of a single row or column of pixels). You can access 
these other Marquee tools by holding down on the default, Rectangle 
Marquee tool in the Tools panel.
To create a selection, select one of the Marquee tools (remember you can 
press M) and then drag anywhere on your image. When you release the 
mouse button, you create an active selection area. When you’re working on 
an active selection area, whatever effects you choose are applied to the 
whole selection. To deselect an area, you have three choices:
 
✦ Choose Select➪Deselect.
 
✦ Press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Ô+D (Mac).
 
✦ While using a selection tool, click outside the selection area.
How you make a selection is important because it determines how realistic 
your edits appear on the image. You can use the following tips and tricks 
when creating both rectangular and elliptical selections:
 
✦ Add to a selection by holding down the Shift key; drag to create a 
second selection that intersects the original selection (see the left image 
in Figure 4-1). The two selections become one big selection.
 
✦ Delete from an existing selection by holding the Alt (Windows) or Option 
(Mac) key and then drag to create a second selection that intersects 
the original selection where you want to take away from the original 
selection (on the right in Figure 4-1).
 
✦ Constrain a rectangle or ellipse to a square or circle by Shift+dragging; 
make sure that you release the mouse button before you release the 
Shift key. Holding down the Shift key makes a square or circle only when 
there are no other selections. (Otherwise, it adds to the selection.)

Book IV
Chapter 4

✦ Make the selection from the center by Alt+dragging (Windows) or 
Option+dragging (Mac); make sure that you release the mouse button 
before the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key.
 
✦ Create a square or circle from the center out by Alt+Shift+dragging 
(Windows) or Option+Shift+dragging (Mac). Again, make sure that you 
always release the mouse button before the modifier keys.
 
✦ When making a selection, hold down the spacebar before releasing the 
mouse button to drag the selection to another location.

You can

delete from 
selections.
 
Fixed size
If you’ve created an effect that you particularly like — say, changing a block 
of color in your image — and you want to apply it multiple times throughout 
an image, you can do so. To make the exact same selection multiple times, 
follow these steps:
 
1. With the Marquee tool selected, select Fixed Size from the Style 
drop-down list on the Options bar.
 
 You can also select Fixed Ratio from the Style drop-down list to create 
a proportionally correct selection, but not fixed to an exact size.
 
2. On the Options bar, type the Width and Height values into the 
appropriate text fields.
 
 You can change ruler increments by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪
Units and Rulers (Windows) or Photoshop➪Preferences➪Units and 
Rulers (Mac).

Getting to Know the Selection Tools
406
 
3. Click the image.
 
 A selection sized to your values appears.
 
4. With the selection tool, drag the selection to the location that you 
want selected.
 
Shift+drag a selection to keep it aligned to a straight, 45-degree, or 
90-degree angle.
Floating and nonfloating selections
As a default, when you’re using a selection tool, such as the Marquee 
tool, your selections are floating, which means that you can drag them to 
another location without affecting the underlying pixels. You know that 
your selection is floating by the little rectangle that appears on your cursor 
(see the left image in Figure 4-2).
If you want to, however, you can move the underlying pixels. With the selec-
tion tool of your choice, just hold down the Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) key 
to temporarily access the Move tool; the cursor changes to a pointer with 
scissors, denoting that your selection is nonfloating. Now, when you drag, 
the pixel data comes with the selection (as shown on the right in Figure 4-2).
 
Hold down Alt+Ctrl (Windows) or Option+Ô (Mac) while using a selection 
tool and drag to clone (copy) pixels from one location to another. Add the 
Shift key, and the cloned copy is constrained to a straight, 45-degree, or 
90-degree angle.
 
Figure 4-2: 
The Float 
icon is used 
on the left, 
and the 
Move icon 
is used on 
the right.
 
The Lasso tool
 
 Use the Lasso tool for freeform selections (selections of an irregular shape). 
To use the Lasso tool, just drag and create a path surrounding the area to be 
selected. If you don’t return to your start point to close the selection before 
you release the mouse button, Photoshop completes the path by finding the 
most direct route back to your starting point.

Just like with the Marquee tool, you can press the Shift key to add to a lasso 
selection and press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) to delete from a 
lasso selection.
Hold down on the Lasso tool to show the hidden Lasso tools, the Polygonal 
Lasso and the Magnetic Lasso tool. Use the Polygonal Lasso tool by clicking 
a start point and then clicking and releasing from point to point until you 
come back to close the selection. Use the Magnetic Lasso tool by clicking to 
create a starting point and then hovering the cursor near an edge in your 
image. The Magnetic Lasso tool is magnetically attracted to edges; as you 
move your cursor near an edge, the Magnetic Lasso tool creates a selection 
along that edge. Click to manually set points in the selection; when you get 
back to the starting point, click to close the selection.
You may find that the Polygonal Lasso and the Magnetic Lasso tools don’t 
make as nice of a selection as you want. Take a look at the upcoming section, 
“Painting with the Quick Mask tool,” for tips on making finer selections.
The Quick Selection tool
 
 The Quick Selection tool was introduced in CS3. This incredible tool lets you 
quickly “paint” a selection with a round brush tip of adjustable size. Click 
and drag and then watch as the selection expands outward and automati-
cally follows defined edges in the image. A Refine Edge command lets you 
improve the quality of the selection edges and visualize the selection in dif-
ferent ways for easy editing.
Follow these steps to find out how you can take advantage of this new tool:
 
1. Open a file that requires a selection.
 
 You can find sample images in Windows at C:\Program Files\
Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS4\Extras\Samples and on the Mac at 
Applications\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Extras\Samples.
 
2. Select the Quick Selection tool.
 
3. Position the cursor over the area that you wish to select. Notice the 
brush size displayed with the cursor; click and drag to start painting 
the selection.
 
 You can adjust the size of the painting selection by pressing [ to make 
the brush size smaller or ] to make the brush size larger.
 
 With the Add to Selection or Subtract from Selection buttons in the 
Options bar, you can paint more of the selection or deselect active areas 
(see Figure 4-3).

Figure 4-3:

The Magic Wand tool
 
 The Magic Wand tool is particularly helpful when you’re working on an 
image of high contrast or with a limited number of colors. This tool selects 
individual pixels of similar shades and colors. Select the Magic Wand tool, 
click anywhere on an image, and hope for the best — the Magic Wand tool 
isn’t magic at all. You decide how successful this tool is. What we mean by 
that is that you control how closely matched each pixel must be in order for 
the Magic Wand tool to include it in the selection. You do so by setting the 
tolerance on the Options bar.
When you have the Magic Wand tool selected, a Tolerance text field appears 
on the Options bar. As a default, the tolerance is set to 32. When you click 
with a setting of 32, the Magic Wand tool selects all pixels within 32 shades 
(steps) of the color that you clicked. If it didn’t select as much as you want, 
increase the value in the Tolerance text field (all the way up to 255). The 
amount that you enter really varies with each individual selection. If you’re 
selecting white napkins on an off-white tablecloth, you can set as low as 5 so 
that the selection doesn’t leak into other areas. For colored fabric with lots 
of tonal values, you might increase the tolerance to 150.
 
Don’t fret if you miss the entire selection when using the Magic Wand tool. 
Hold down the Shift key and click in the missed areas. If the tool selects too 
much, choose Edit➪Undo (step backward) or press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or 
Ô+Z (Mac), reduce the value in the Tolerance text field, and try again.

Creating a Selection
Getting to Know the Selection Tools
409
Painting with the Quick Mask tool
If you have fuzzy selections (fur, hair, or leaves, for example) or you’re 
having difficulty using the selection tools, the Quick Mask tool can be 
a huge help because it allows you to paint your selection uniformly in one 
fell swoop.
To enter into Quick Mask mode, create a selection and then press Q. 
(Pressing Q again exits you from Quick Mask mode.) You can also click the 
Quick Mask button at the bottom of the Tools panel. If you have a printing 
background, you’ll notice that the Quick Mask mode, set at its default 
color (red), resembles something that you may want to forget: rubylith and 
amberlith. (Remember slicing up those lovely films with Exacto blades 
before computer masking came along?) In Quick Mask mode, Photoshop 
shows your image as it appears through the mask. The clear part is selected; 
what’s covered in the mask isn’t selected.
To create and implement a quick mask, follow these steps:
 
1. Press Q to enter Quick Mask mode.
 
2. Press D to change the foreground and background color boxes the 
default colors of black and white.
 
3. Select the Brush tool and start painting with black in the clear area of 
the image in Quick Mask mode.
 
 It doesn’t have to be pretty; just get a stroke or two in there.
 
4. Press Q to return to the Selection mode.
 
 You’re now out of Quick Mask mode. Notice that where you painted with 
black (it turned red in the Quick Mask mode), the pixels are no longer 
selected.
 
5. Press Q again to re-enter the Quick Mask mode and then press X.
 
 This step switches the foreground and background colors (giving you 
white in the foreground, black in the background).
 
 6. With the Brush tool, paint several white strokes in the red mask area.
 
 
 The white strokes turn clear in the Quick Mask mode.
 
7. Press Q to return to the Selection mode.
 
 Where you painted white in the Quick Mask mode is now selected.
When in Quick Mask mode, you can paint white over areas you want 
selected and black over areas that you don’t want selected. When painting in 
the Quick Mask mode, increase the brush size by pressing the ] key. 
Decrease the brush size by pressing the [ key.

Manipulating Selections with Refine Selection
410
In the Selection mode, your selection seems to have a hard edge; you can 
soften those hard edges by using a softer brush in the Quick Mask mode. To 
make a brush softer, press Shift+[; to make a brush harder, press Shift+].
Because the Quick Mask mode makes selections based on the mask’s values, 
you can create a mask by selecting the Gradient tool and dragging it across 
the image in Quick Mask mode. When you exit Quick Mask mode, it looks as 
though there’s a straight-line selection, but actually the selection transitions 
as your gradient did. Choose any filter from the Filters menu and notice how 
the filter transitions into the untouched part of the image to which you 
applied the gradient.
If you’re working in Quick Mask mode, choose Window➪Channels to see that 
what you’re working on is a temporary alpha channel. See the later section, 
“Saving Selections,” for more about alpha channels.
Manipulating Selections with Refine Selection
After you master creating selections, you’ll find that working with the 
selections — painting, transforming, and feathering them — can be easy 
and fun.
Transforming selections
Don’t deselect and start over again if you can just nudge or resize your 
selection a bit. You can scale, rotate, and even distort an existing selection. 
Follow these steps to transform a selection:
 
1. Create a selection and then choose Select➪Transform Selection.
 
 You can use the bounding box to resize and rotate your selection.
 
• Drag the handles to make the selection larger or smaller. Drag a 
corner handle to adjust width and height simultaneously. Shift+drag 
a corner handle to size proportionally.
 
• Position the cursor outside the bounding box to see the Rotate icon; 
drag when it appears to rotate the selection. Shift+drag to constrain 
to straight, 45-degree, or 90-degree angles.
 
• Ctrl+drag (Windows) or Ô+drag (Mac) a corner point to distort the 
selection, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
2. Press Enter or Return or double-click in the center of the selection 
area to confirm the transformation; press Esc to release the transfor-
mation and return to the original selection.

Feathering
Knowing how to retouch an image means little if you don’t know how to 
make the retouching discreet. If you boost up the color using curves to the 
CEO’s face, do you want it to appear like a pancake has been attached to his 
cheek? Of course not — that isn’t discreet at all (or very wise). That’s where 
feathering comes in. Feathering a selection blurs its edges, so as to create a 
natural-looking transition between the selection and the background of 
the image.
To feather an image, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a selection.
 
 For the nonfeathered image shown on top in Figure 4-5, we used the 
Elliptical Marquee tool to make a selection. We then copied the 
selection, created a new, blank image, and pasted the selection into 
the new image.
 
 To create the feathered image on the bottom in Figure 4-5, we used the 
Elliptical Marquee tool to select the same area on the original image and 
went on to Step 2.
 
2. Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather.
 
3. In the Feather dialog box that appears, type a value in the Feather 
Radius text field and then click OK.
 
 For example, we entered 20 in the Feather Radius text field. (We then 
copied the selection, created a new image, and pasted the feathered 
selection into the new image to create the image on the bottom of 
Figure 4-5.) Voilà! The edges of the image are softened over a 20-pixel 
area, as shown on the bottom of Figure 4-5. This technique is also 
referred to as a vignette in the printing industry.

Chapter 4

The results of the feathering depend upon the resolution of the image. A 
feather of 20 pixels in a 72-ppi (pixels per inch) image will be a much larger 
area than a feather of 20 pixels in a 300-ppi image. Typical amounts for a 
nice vignette on an edge of an image would be 20 to 50 pixels. Experiment 
with your images to find what works best for you.
This feathering effect created a nice soft edge to your image, but it’s also 
useful when retouching images:
 
1. Using any selection method, create a selection around a part of an 
image that you want to lighten.
 
2. Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather; in the Feather dialog box that 
appears, enter 25 in the Feather Radius text field and click OK.
 
 If you get an error message stating, “No pixels are more than 50% 
selected,” click OK and create a larger selection.
 
3. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Curves.
 
4. Click in the center of the curve to add an anchor point and drag up to 
lighten the image.
 
 This step lightens the midtones of the image.
Notice how the lightening fades out so that there’s no definite edge to the 
correction. You can have more fun like this in Chapter 7 of this minibook, 
where we cover color correction.
More fun with selections
Like to experiment, but also want a preview of exactly what your changes to 
the selection are actually doing? Then you’ll love the Refine Edge feature. 
The Refine Edge feature was introduced in Photoshop CS3 and is available 
in the Options bar across the top of the Photoshop window whenever you 
have any selection tool active.
To use the Refine Edge feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Make a selection.
 
2. With any selection tool active, click the Refine Edge button in the 
Options bar at the top of the Photoshop window.
 
 The Refine Edge dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.

Saving Selections
414
 
Figure 4-6:

edges of a

with the

dialog box.
 
 
3. Choose a preview method by clicking the icons across the bottom of 
the Refine Edge dialog box.
 
 On White is the default setting, and it shows your selection as it would 
appear on a white background.
 
 Don’t worry! The rest of your image hasn’t been removed; this preview 
helps you to better see the effects of this feature.
 
 Here are the selections that you can choose from in the Refine Edge 
dialog box:
 
• Radius: Radius determines the size of the region around the selection 
boundary in which edge refinement occurs.
 
• Contrast: Contrast sharpens selection edges and removes fuzzy 
artifacts.
 
• Smooth: Smooth reduces irregular areas in the selection boundary.
 
• Feather: Feather creates a soft-edged transition between the 
selection and its surrounding pixels.
 
• Contract/Expand: Use Contract/Expand to shrink or enlarge the 
selection boundary.
 
4. When you’re happy with the results, click OK.
Saving Selections
The term alpha channel sounds pretty complicated, but it’s simply a saved 
selection. Depending upon the mode you’re in, you already have several 
channels to contend with. A selection is just an extra channel that you can 
call on at any time.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Creating a Selection
Using the Improved Vanishing Point Feature
415
To create an alpha channel, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a selection that you want to save.
 
2. Choose Select➪Save Selection.
 
3. Name the Selection and click OK.
 
 An additional named channel that contains your selection appears in the 
Channels panel.
To load a saved selection, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Select➪Load Selection.
 
 The Load Selection dialog box appears.
 
2. Select your named channel from the Channel drop-down list.
 
 If you have an active selection and then choose to load a selection, you 
have additional options. You can do the following with an active selec-
tion when loading a channel by selecting one of the following options:
 
• New Selection: Eliminate the existing selection and create a new 
selection based upon the channel you select.
 
• Add to Selection: Add the channel to the existing selection.
 
• Subtract from Selection: Subtract the channel from the existing 
selection.
 
• Intersect with Selection: Intersect the channel with the existing 
selection.
 
3. Click OK.
 
Other Adobe applications, such as InDesign, Illustrator, Premiere, and After 
Effects, can also recognize alpha channels.
Using the Improved Vanishing Point Feature
This incredible new feature lets you preserve correct perspective in edits 
of images that contain perspective planes, such as the sides of a building. 
You can do so much with this feature, and we provide you with a simple 
introduction. Try experimenting with multiple planes and copying and 
pasting items into the Vanishing Point window for even more effects. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open a file that you want to apply a perspective filter to.
 
 If you don’t have an appropriate image handy, try using a Vanishing 
Point.psd file. You can find the file in Windows at C:\Program 
Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Extras\Samples and on the 
Mac at Applications\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Extra\
Samples.

Using the Improved Vanishing Point Feature
416
 
2. Create a new blank layer by clicking the Create a New Layer button at 
the bottom of the Layers panel.
 
 If you create a new layer each time you use Vanishing Point, the results 
appear on a separate layer. Putting the Vanishing Point results in a 
separate layer and also preserves your original image, as you can delete 
the result of the vanishing point filter and still retain your original layer.
 
3. Choose Filter➪Vanishing Point.
 
 A separate Vanishing Point window appears. If you receive an error 
message about an existing plane, click OK.
 
 If you’re using a sample file from Photoshop, it will have a perspective 
plane already created for you. To help you understand this feature 
better, delete the existing plane by pressing the Delete or Backspace key.
 
4. Select the Create Plane tool and define the four corner nodes of the 
plane surface.
 
 Try to use objects in the image to help create the plane. In Figure 4-7, 
the planks of wood were used to make the perspective plane.
 
 After the four corner nodes of the plane are created, the tool automati-
cally is switched to the Edit Plane tool.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Use objects 
in an image 
to build a

5. Select and drag the corner nodes to make an accurate plane.
 
 The plane grid should appear blue, not yellow or red, if it’s accurate.
 
 After creating the plane, you can move, scale, or reshape the plane. 
Keep in mind that your results depend on how accurately the plane lines 
up with perspective of the image.
 
 You can use your first Vanishing Point session to simply create perspec-
tive planes and then click OK. The planes appear in subsequent 
Vanishing Point sessions when you choose Filter➪Vanishing Point. 
Saving perspective planes is especially useful if you plan to copy and 
paste an image into Vanishing Point and need to have a ready-made 
plane to target.
 
6. Choose the Stamp tool in the Vanishing Point window and then 
choose On from the Heal drop-down list in the Options bar.
 
 You’ll love where this is going. In the example image, Vanishing 
Point.psd, we simply clone the blue broom, but it should get your 
brain working about all the ways that you can apply this greatly 
improved feature.
 
7. With the Stamp tool still selected, cross over part of the area or part of 
the image you want to clone and Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click 
(Mac) to define it as the source that’s to be cloned.
 
 In the image Vanishing Point.psd, we clicked the middle part of the 
blue broom.
 
8. Without clicking, move toward the back of the perspective plane 
(you can even clone outside the plane) and then click and drag to 
reproduce the cloned part of the image.
 
 Notice in Figure 4-8, it’s cloned as a smaller version, in the correct 
perspective for its new location.
 
9. Start from Step 7 and clone any region of an image up closer to the 
front of the perspective pane.
 
 The cloned region is now cloned as a larger version of itself.
 
 You can use the Marquee tool options (Feather, Opacity, Heal, and Move 
Mode) at any time, either before or after making the selection. When you 
move the Marquee tool, the Stamp tool, or the Brush tool into a plane, 
the bounding box is highlighted, indicating that the plane is active.

Chapter 5: Using the 
Photoshop Pen Tool
In This Chapter
✓ Putting shape layers to work
✓ Working with a path as a selection
✓ Creating clipping paths
T
he Pen tool is the ultimate method to make precise selections. You can 
also use it to create vector shapes and clipping paths (silhouettes). In 
this chapter, you discover how to take advantage of this super multitasking 
tool. This chapter also shows you how to apply paths made with the Pen 
tool as shapes, selections, and clipping paths. If you’re interested in the 
fundamentals of creating paths with the Pen tool in Illustrator, check out 
Book III, Chapter 5, where we cover the Pen tool in more detail.
We recommend that you use the Pen tool as much as you can to truly 
master its capabilities. If you don’t use it on a regular basis, it will seem awk-
ward, but it does get easier! Knowing how to effectively use the Pen tool 
puts you a grade above the average Photoshop user, and the quality of your 
selections will show it. Read Chapter 9 of this minibook to find out how to 
use the Pen tool to create layer masks and adjustment layers.
Using Shape Layers
As a default, when you start creating with the Pen tool, Photoshop automati-
cally creates a shape layer, which is useful for adding additional elements, 
but is frustrating if you’re attempting to create just a path with the Pen tool. 
Select the Pen tool and note the default setting on the left side of the 
Options bar. You can choose from the following options:
 
✦ Shape layers: Creates a new shape layer, a filled layer that contains 
your vector path.
 
✦ Paths: Creates a path only; no layer is created.
 
✦ Fill pixels: Creates pixels directly on the image. No editable path or 
layer is created. This option may not be useful to new users, but some 
existing users prefer to use this method because it’s the only way to 
access the Line tool from earlier versions.

Using Shape Layers
420
Shape layers can be very useful when the goal of your design is to seam-
lessly integrate vector shapes and pixel data. A shape layer can contain 
vector shapes that you can then modify with the same features of any other 
layer. You can adjust the opacity of the shape layer, change the blending 
mode, and even apply layer effects to add drop shadows and dimension. 
Find out how to do this in Chapter 9 of this minibook.
Create a shape layer with any of these methods:
 
✦ Create a shape with the Pen tool. With the Pen tool, you can create 
interesting custom shapes and even store them for future use. We show 
you how in the following section.
 
✦ Use a Vector Shape tool, as shown in Figure 5-1. Vector shapes are 
premade shapes (you can even create your own!) that you can create by 
dragging on your image area with a shape tool.
 
✦ Import a shape from Illustrator. Choose File➪Place and choose an .ai 
file; when the Options window appears, choose to place as a shape layer 
or a path. This imports an Illustrator file as a shape layer or path into 
Photoshop.

Creating and using a custom shape
Perhaps you like the wave kind of shape (see Figure 5-2) that’s been 
cropping up in design pieces all over the place.

421
 
You can copy and paste shapes right from Illustrator CS4 into Photoshop 
CS4. Simply select your shape in Adobe Illustrator, choose Edit➪Copy, 
switch to the Photoshop application, and with a document open, choose 
Edit➪Paste.
You can create a wavy shape like that, too. With an image or blank docu-
ment open, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click and drag with the Pen tool to create a wavy shape.
 
 Don’t worry about the size of the shape. The shape is vector, so you can 
scale it up or down to whatever size you need without worrying about 
making jagged edges. Just make sure that you close the shape (return to 
the original point with the end point).
 
 When you create the shape, it fills in with your foreground color. Try to 
ignore it if you can; the next section shows you how to change the fill 
color, and Chapter 8 of this minibook covers how to change it to a 
transparent fill.
 
2. With the shape still selected, choose Edit➪Define Custom Shape, name 
the shape, and press OK.
 
 After you save your custom shape, you can re-create it at any time. If 
you don’t like the shape, choose Windows➪Layers to open the Layers 
panel and then drag the shape layer you just created to the Trash Can in 
the lower-right corner of the panel. If you want to experiment with your 
custom shape now, continue with these steps.
 
3. Click and hold on the Rectangle tool to access the other hidden vector 
tools; select the last tool, the Custom Shape tool.
 
 When the Custom Shape tool is selected, a Shape drop-down list appears 
on the Options bar at the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 5-3.
 
 You have lots of custom shapes to choose from, including the one 
you’ve just created. If you just saved a shape, yours is in the last square; 
you have to scroll down to select it.

4. Select your custom shape; click and drag in the image area to create 
your shape.
 
 You can make it any size that you want.
 
5. To change the shape’s size, choose Edit➪Free Transform Path, press 
Ctrl+T (Windows) or Ô+T (Mac), grab a bounding box handle, and 
drag.
 
 Shift+drag a corner handle to keep the shape proportional as you 
resize it.
 
Because a shape is created on its own layer, you can experiment with 
different levels of transparency and blending modes in the Layers panel. 
Figure 5-4 shows shapes that are partially transparent. Discover lots of 
other features you can use with shape layers in Chapter 9 of this minibook.

Changing the color of the shape
When you create a shape with a shape tool, the shape takes the color of 
your present foreground color. To change the color of an existing shape, 
open the Layers panel by choosing Window➪Layers; notice that the Vector 
Shape tool creates a new layer for every shape you make. Creating a new 
layer is a benefit when it comes to creating special effects because the 
shape layer is independent of the rest of your image. (Read more about 
using layers in Chapter 9 of this minibook.)

To change a shape’s color, double-click the color thumbnail on the left in the 
shape layer, or click the Set Color box in the Options bar across the top of 
the Document window. The Color Picker appears, as shown in Figure 5-5. To 
select a new color, drag the Hue slider up or down or click in the large color 
pane to select a color with the saturation and lightness that you want to use. 
Click OK when you’re done.
 
With the Color Picker open, you can also move outside the picker dialog box 
and sample colors from other open images and objects.
 
Figure 5-5:

Editing a shape
 
 Like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop provides both a Path Selection tool and a 
Direct Selection tool. The Direct Selection tool is hidden under the Path 
Selection tool. To move an entire shape on a layer, choose the Path Selection 
 
 tool and drag the shape.
To edit the shape, deselect the shape (while using the Path Selection or 
Direct Selection tool, click outside the shape). Then select the Direct 
Selection tool. With the Direct Selection tool, click individual anchor points 
and handles to edit and fine-tune the shape, as shown in Figure 5-6.

Using a Path as a Selection
424
Removing a shape layer
Because the Pen tool now has multiple options, you may find yourself unex-
pectedly creating a shape layer. Delete a shape layer by dragging the layer 
thumbnail to the Trash Can in the lower-right corner of the Layers panel.
If you want to keep your path but throw away the shape layer, choose 
Window➪Paths. Then drag the shape vector mask to the New Path icon, as 
shown in Figure 5-7, which creates a saved path. Now you can throw away 
the shape layer.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Save your 
path by 
dragging 
the shape 
path to the 
Create New 
Path icon.
 
Using a Path as a Selection
You can use the Pen tool to create precise selections that would be difficult 
to create with other selection methods. The Pen tool produces clean edges 
that print well and can be edited using the Direct Selection tool. Before using 
the Pen tool, make sure that you click the Paths button on the Options bar.
To use a path as a selection (which is extremely helpful when you’re trying 
to make a precise selection), follow these steps:
 
1. Open any file or create a new blank file.
 
2. With the Pen tool (make sure that the Paths button is selected on the 
Options bar or else you’ll create a shape layer), click to place anchor 
points.
 
3. Drag to create a curved path around the image area that you want 
selected and completely close the path by returning to the start point 
(see Figure 5-8).
 
 Use the techniques that we discuss in Book III, Chapter 4 to perform this 
step. A circle appears before you click to close the path.
 
4. Choose Window➪Paths.
 
 In the Paths panel, you can create new and activate existing paths, apply 
a stroke, or turn paths into selections by clicking the icons at the 
bottom of the panel (see Figure 5-9).

Clipping Paths
If you want to create a beautiful silhouette that transfers well to other 
applications for text wrapping (see Figure 5-10), create a clipping path.

Clipping Paths
426
 
Figure 5-10: 
Clipping 
paths 
allow you 
to create 
silhouettes 
in other 
applications.
 
Creating a clipping path is easy when you have a good path! Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Use the Pen tool to create a path around the image area that’s to be 
the silhouette.
 
2. In the Paths panel, choose Save Path from the panel menu (click the 
triangle in the upper-right corner of the panel to access this menu), 
as shown in Figure 5-11, and then name the path.
 
 If Save Path is grayed out, your path has already been saved; skip to 
Step 3.
 
3. From the same panel menu, choose Clipping Path.
 
4. In the Clipping Paths dialog box, choose your path from the drop-
down list if it’s not already selected; click OK.
 
 Leave the Flatness Device Pixels text field blank unless you have a need 
to change it. The flatness value determines how many device pixels are 
used to create your silhouette. The higher the amount, the less points 
are created, thereby allowing for faster processing time. This speed 
does come at a cost, though; set the flatness value too high, and you 
may see (you’d have to look really close) straight edges instead of 
curved edges.

5. Choose File➪Save As and in the Format drop-down list, select 
Photoshop EPS; in the EPS Options dialog box that appears, accept the 
defaults and click OK.
 
 If you get PostScript errors when printing, choose Clipping Path from 
the panel menu and up the value to 2 pixels in the Flatness Device Pixels 
text field. Keep returning to this text field and upping the value until the 
file prints, or give up and try printing your document with another 
printer.
 
 If you’re placing this file in other Adobe applications, such as InDesign, 
you don’t need to save the file as EPS; you can leave it as a Photoshop 
(.psd) file.
Here’s an even faster method that you can use to create a clipping path that 
can be used in other Adobe applications, such as InDesign and Illustrator:
 
1. Create a path around the item that you wish to keep when the clipping 
path is created.
 
 Make sure that you’re working on a layer and not the Background layer. 
To convert the Background layer to a layer, hold down the Alt key 
(Windows) or the Option key (Mac) and double-click the Background 
layer. The Background layer is now Layer 0.
 
 2. In the Layers panel, click the Add Layer Mask button and then click 
the Add Layer Mask button again.

S
omething as important as getting the right resolution for your images 
deserves its own chapter, but fortunately, the topic isn’t all that 
complex. In this chapter, you discover the necessary resolution for various 
uses of Photoshop imagery (from printing a high-resolution graphic 
to e-mailing a picture of your kids to Mom), how to properly increase the 
resolution, and how to adjust image size.
Having the proper resolution is important to the final outcome of your 
image, especially if you plan to print that image. Combine the information 
here with using the correction tools that we show you in the Chapter 7 of 
this minibook, and you should be ready to roll with great imagery.
Creating Images for Print
To see and make changes to the present size and resolution of an image in 
Photoshop, choose Image➪Image Size. The Image Size dialog box appears.
 
The Width and Height text fields in the Pixel Dimensions area of the Image 
Size dialog box are used for on-screen resizing, such as for the Web and 
e-mail. The Width and Height text fields in the Document Size area show the 
size at which the image will print. The Resolution text field determines the 
resolution of the printed image; a higher value means a smaller, more finely 
detailed printed image.
Before you decide upon a resolution, understand what some of the 
resolution jargon means:
 
✦ dpi (dots per inch): The resolution of an image when printed.
 
✦ lpi (lines per inch): The varying dot pattern that printers and presses 
use to create images (see Figure 6-1). This dot pattern is referred to as 
the lpi, even though it represents rows of dots. The higher the lpi, the 
finer the detail and the less of the dot pattern or line screen you see.

Creating Images for Print
430
 
✦ Dot gain: The spread of ink as it’s applied to paper. Certain types of 
paper will wick a dot of ink farther than others. For example, newsprint 
has a high dot gain and typically prints at 85 lpi; a coated stock paper 
has a lower dot gain and can be printed at 133–150 lpi and even higher.
Human eyes typically can’t detect a dot pattern in a printed image at 133 dpi 
or higher.
 
Figure 6-1: 
The dot 
pattern 
used to print 
images is 
referred to 
as lpi (lines 
per inch).
 
 
Deciding the resolution or dpi of an image requires backward planning. If 
you want to create the best possible image, you should know where it’ll 
print before deciding the resolution. Communicate with your printer service 
if the image is going to press. If you’re sending your image to a high-speed 
copier, you can estimate that it will handle 100 lpi; a desktop printer will 
handle 85 lpi to 100 lpi.
The resolution formula
When creating an image for print, keep this formula in mind:
2 x lpi = dpi (dots per inch)
This formula means that if your image is going to press using 150 lpi, have 
your image at 300 dpi. To save space, many people in production use 1.5 x 
lpi because it reduces the file size significantly and you get very similar 
results; you can decide which works best for you.
Changing the resolution
Using the Image Size dialog box is only one way that you can control the 
resolution in Photoshop. Even though you can increase the resolution, 
do so sparingly and avoid it if you can. The exception is when you have an 
image that is large in dimension size but low in resolution, like those that 
you typically get from a digital camera. You may have a top-of-the-line digital 
camera that produces 72 dpi images, but at that resolution, the pictures are 
28 x 21 inches (or larger)!

Chapter 6

Resolution Basics
Creating Images for Print
431
To increase the resolution of an image without sacrificing quality:
 
1. Choose Image➪Image Size.
 
 The Image Size dialog box appears.
 
2. Deselect the Resample Image check box.
 
 This way, Photoshop doesn’t add additional pixels.
 
3. Enter the desired resolution in the Resolution text field.
 
 Photoshop keeps the pixel size (the size of the image on-screen) the 
same, but the document size (the size of the image when printed) 
decreases when you enter a higher resolution.
 
4. If the image isn’t the size that you need it to be, select the Resample 
Image check box and type the size in the Width and Height text fields 
in the Document Size section.
 
 Note that it’s best to reduce the size of a bitmap image, such as a digital 
photo, rather than increase it.
 
 You can also deselect the Resample Image check box and essentially 
play a game of give and take to see what the resolution will be when you 
enter the size you want your image printed at in the Width and Height 
text fields in the Document Size area.
 
 Images can typically be scaled from 50 to 120 percent before looking 
jagged (to scale by a percentage, select Percent from the drop-down 
lists beside the Width and Height text fields). Keep this in mind when 
placing and resizing your images in a page layout application, such as 
InDesign.
 
 5. Click OK when you’re finished; double-click the Zoom tool in the 
Tools panel to see the image at actual size on-screen.
 
To increase the resolution without changing the image size, follow these 
steps. (This situation isn’t perfect because pixels that don’t presently exist 
are created by Photoshop and may not be totally accurate. Photoshop tries 
to give you the best image, but you may have some loss of detail.)
 
1. Choose Image➪Image Size.
 
2. When the Image Size dialog box appears, make sure that the Resample 
Image check box is selected.
 
 Note that Bicubic is selected in the Method drop-down list. This method 
is the best, but slowest, way to reinterpret pixels when you resize an 
image. With this method, Photoshop essentially looks at all the pixels 
and takes a good guess as to how the newly created pixels should look, 
based upon surrounding pixels.
 
3. Enter the resolution that you need in the Resolution text field, 
click OK, and then double-click the Zoom tool to see the image at 
actual size.

Determining the Resolution for Web Images
432
Determining the Resolution for Web Images
Did you ever have somebody e-mail you an image, and, after spending ten 
minutes downloading it, you discover that the image is so huge that all you 
can see on the monitor is your nephew’s left eye? Many people are under 
the misconception that if an image is 72 dpi, it’s ready for the Web. Actually, 
pixel dimension is all that matters for Web viewing of images; this section 
helps you make sense of this.
Most people view Web pages in their browser windows in an area of about 
640 x 480 pixels. You can use this figure as a basis for any images you create 
for the Web, whether the viewer is using a 14-inch or a 21-inch monitor. 
(Remember, those people who have large monitors set to high screen 
resolutions don’t necessarily want a Web page taking up the whole screen!) 
If you’re creating images for a Web page or to attach to an e-mail message, 
you may want to pick a standard size to design by, such as 600 x 400 pixels 
at 72 dpi.
To use the Image Size dialog box to determine the resolution and size for 
on-screen images, follow these steps:
 
1. Have an image open and choose Image➪Image Size.
 
 The Image Size dialog box appears.
 
2. To make the image take up half the width of a typical browser 
window, type 300 (half of 600) in the top Width text field.
 
 If a little chain link is visible to the right, the Constrain Proportions 
check box is selected, and Photoshop automatically determines the 
height from the width that you entered.
 
3. Click OK and double-click the Zoom tool to see the image at actual 
size on-screen.
 
 That’s it! Whether your image is 3,000 or 30 pixels wide doesn’t matter; 
as long as you enter the correct dimensions in the Pixel Dimension area, 
the image works beautifully.
Applying the Unsharp Mask Filter to an Image
When you resample an image in Photoshop, it can become blurry. A good 
practice is to apply the Unsharp Mask filter. This feature sharpens the 
image based upon levels of contrast, while keeping the areas that don’t have 
contrasting pixels smooth. You do have to set up this feature correctly to 
get good results. Here’s the down-and-dirty method of using the Unsharp 
Mask filter:
 
1. Choose View➪Actual Pixels or double-click the Zoom tool.

Book IV
Chapter 6
Thinking about 
Resolution Basics
Applying the Unsharp Mask Filter to an Image
433
 
 When you’re using a filter, view your image at actual size to best see 
the effect.
 
2. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.
 
 In the Unsharp Mask dialog box that appears, set these three options:
 
• Amount: The Amount value ranges from 0 to 500. The amount that 
you choose has a lot to do with the subject matter. Sharpening a car 
or appliance at 300 to 400 is fine, but do this to the CEO’s 75-year-old 
wife, and you may suffer an untimely death because every wrinkle, 
mole, or hair will magically become more defined. If you’re not sure 
what to use, start with 150 and play around until you find an Amount 
value that looks good.
 
• Radius: The Unsharp Mask filter creates a halo around the areas that 
have enough contrast to be considered an edge. Typically, leaving 
the amount between 1 to 2 is fine for print, but if you’re creating a 
billboard or poster, increase the size.
 
• Threshold: This option is the most important one in the Unsharp 
Mask dialog box. The Threshold setting is what determines what 
should be sharpened. If left at zero, you’ll see noise throughout the 
image, much like the grain that you see in high-speed film. Bring it up 
to 10, and this triggers the Unsharp Mask filter to apply only the 
sharpening when the pixels are ten shades or more away from each 
other. The amount of tolerance ranges from 1 to 255. Apply too 
much, and no sharpening appears; apply too little, and the image 
becomes grainy. A good number to start with is 10.
 
 To compare the original state of the image with the preview of the 
Unsharp Mask filter’s effect in the preview pane of the Unsharp Mask 
dialog box, click and hold on the image in the Preview pane; this shows 
the original state of the image. When you release the mouse button, the 
Unsharp Mask filter is previewed again.
 
3. When you’ve made your choice, click OK.
 
 The image appears to have more detail.
Once in a while, stray colored pixels may appear after you apply the 
Unsharp Mask filter. If you feel this is a problem with your image, choose 
Edit➪Fade Unsharp Mask immediately after applying the Unsharp Mask 
filter. In the Fade dialog box, select the Luminosity blend mode from the 
Mode drop-down list and then click OK. This step applies the Unsharp 
Mask filter to the grays in the image only, thereby eliminating sharpening of 
colored pixels.
 
Note that you can also choose Filter➪Convert for Smart Filters before you 
apply the Unsharp Mask filter. Smart filters allow you to undo all or some of 
any filter, including sharpening filters that you apply to a layer. Find out how 
by reading Chapter 9 in this minibook.

W
ith all the incredible things you can do in Photoshop, you can 
easily forget the basics. Yes, you can create incredible compositions 
with special effects, but if the people look greenish, it detracts from the 
image. Get in the habit of building good clean images before heading into 
the artsy filters and fun things. Color correction isn’t complicated, and if 
done properly, it’ll produce magical results in your images. In this chapter, 
you discover how to use the values you read in the Info panel and use the 
Curves panel to produce quality image corrections.
Reading a Histogram
Before making adjustments, look at the image’s histogram, which displays an 
image’s tonal values, to evaluate whether the image has sufficient detail to 
produce a high-quality image. In Photoshop CS4, choose 
Window➪Histogram to display the Histogram panel.
 
The greater the range of values in the histogram, the greater the detail. 
Poor images without much information can be difficult, if not impossible, 
to correct. The Histogram panel also displays the overall distribution of 
shadows, midtones, and highlights to help you determine which tonal 
corrections are needed.
Figure 7-1 shows a good full histogram that indicates a smooth transition 
from one shade to another in the image. Figure 7-2 shows that when a 
histogram is spread out and has gaps in it, the image is jumping too quickly 
from one shade to another, producing a posterized effect. Posterization is an 
effect that reduces tonal values to a limited amount, creating a more defined 
range of values from one shade to another. Great if you want it, yucky if you 
want a smooth tonal change from one shadow to another.

So how do you get a good histogram? If you’re scanning, make sure that your 
scanner is set for the maximum amount of colors. Scanning at 16 shades of 
gray gives you 16 lines in your histogram . . . not good!
 
If you have a bad histogram, we recommend that you rescan or reshoot 
the image. If you have a good histogram to start with, keep the histogram 
good by not messing around with multiple tone correction tools. Most 
professionals use the Curves feature . . . and that’s it. Curves (choose 
Image➪Adjustments➪Curves), if used properly, do all the adjusting of 
levels (brightness and contrast) and color balance, all in one step. You can 
read more about curves in the section “Creating a Good Tone Curve,” later in 
this chapter.

Figure 7-3 shows what happens to a perfectly good histogram when someone 
gets a little too zealous and uses the entire plethora of color correction 
controls in Photoshop. Just because the controls are there doesn’t mean 
that you have to use them.
 
If you see a Warning icon appear while you’re making adjustments, double-
click anywhere on the histogram to refresh the display.

Breaking into key types
Don’t panic if your histogram is smashed all the way to the left or right. The 
bars of the histogram represent tonal values. You can break down the types 
of images, based upon their values, into three key types:
 
✦ High key: A very light-colored image, such as the image shown in Figure 
7-4. Information is pushed toward the right in the histogram. Color 
correction has to be handled a little differently for these images to keep 
the light appearance to them.
 
✦ Low key: A very dark image, such as the image shown in Figure 7-5. 
Information is pushed to the left in the histogram. This type of image is 
difficult to scan on low-end scanners because the dark areas tend to 
blend together with little definition.
 
Figure 7-4: 
A high key 
image is a 
light image.

✦ Mid key: A typical image with a full range of shades is considered mid 
key, such as the image shown in Figure 7-6. These images are the most 
common and easiest to work with. In this chapter, we deal with images 
that are considered mid key.

A low key 
image is a 
dark image.
 
 
Figure 7-6:

image with

Setting up the correction
To produce the best possible image, try to avoid correcting in CMYK 
(Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) mode. If your images are typically in RGB 
(Red, Green, Blue) or LAB mode (L for lightness, and A and B for the color-
opponent dimensions), keep them in that mode throughout the process. 
Convert them to CMYK only when you’re finished manipulating the image.

Book IV
Chapter 7

439
 
Don’t forget! Press Ctrl+Y (Windows) or Ô+Y (Mac) to toggle on and off the 
CMYK preview so that you can see what your image will look like in CMYK 
mode without converting it!
Set up these items before starting any color correction:
 
1. Select the Eyedropper tool; on the Options bar, change the sample 
size from Point Sample to 3 by 3 Average in the Sample Size drop-
down list.
 
 This setting gives you more accurate readings.
 
2. If the Histogram panel isn’t already visible, choose 
Window➪Histogram.
 
3. If the Info panel isn’t already visible, choose Window➪Info to show 
the Info panel so that you can check values.
 
4. Make sure that your color settings are correct.
 
 If you’re not sure how to check or set up color settings, see Chapter 3 of 
this minibook.
Creating a Good Tone Curve
A tone curve represents the density of an image. To get the best image, you 
must first find the highlight and shadow points in the image. An image 
created in less-than-perfect lighting conditions may be washed out or have 
odd color casts. See Figure 7-7 for an example of an image with no set 
highlight and shadow. Check out Figure 7-8 to see an image that went 
through the process of setting a highlight and shadow.
 
Figure 7-7:

Figure 7-8: 
The tonal 
values are

after

and shadow

To make the process of creating a good tone curve more manageable, we’ve 
broken the process into four parts:
 
✦ Finding the highlight and shadow
 
✦ Setting the highlight and shadow
 
✦ Adjusting the midtone
 
✦ Finding a neutral
Even though each part has its own set of steps, you must go through all four 
parts to accomplish the task of creating a good tone curve (unless you’re 
working with grayscale images, in which case you can skip the neutral part). 
In this example, an adjustment layer is used for the curve adjustments. The 
benefit is that you can turn off the visibility of the adjustment at a later 
point or double-click the adjustment layer thumbnail to make ongoing edits 
without destroying your image.
Finding and setting the highlight and the shadow
In the non-computer world, you’d spend a fair amount of time trying to 
locate the lightest and darkest parts of an image. Fortunately, you can cheat 
in Photoshop by using some of the features in the Curves panel. Here’s how 
you access the panel:
 
1. With an image worthy of adjustment — one that isn’t perfect already — 
choose Window➪Layer (if the Layers panel isn’t already open).
 
2. Click and hold on the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer button at 
the bottom of the Layers panel and select Curves.
 
 The Adjustments panel appears with the Curves panel active, as shown 
in Figure 7-9.

Book IV
Chapter 7

Notice the grayed-out histogram behind the image in the Curves panel. 
The histogram aids you in determining where you need to adjust the 
image’s curve.
 
If you’re correcting in RGB (as you should be!), the tone curve may be 
opposite of what you think it should be. Instead of light to dark displaying 
as you’d expect, RGB displays dark to light. Now think about it: RGB is 
generated with light, and no RGB means that there’s no light and you 
therefore have black. Turn all RGB on full force, and you create white. Try 
pointing three filtered lights, one red, one green, and one blue. The three 
lights pointed in one direction really do create white.
If working with RGB confuses you, simply select Curve Display Options from 
the panel menu in the upper-right corner of the Adjustments panel. When 
the Curves Display dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-10, select the 
Pigment/Ink % radio button and click OK.
 
 If you need a little more space in the Curves panel, click the Expanded View 
button at the bottom of the Curves panel. The panel enlarges.

Note that in the Curves panel, you see a Preset drop-down list that offers 
quick fixes using standard curves for certain corrections. These settings are 
great for quick fixes, but for the best image, create a custom curve.
The first thing you need to do in the Curves panel is determine the lightest 
and the darkest parts of the image, which is referred to as locating the 
highlight and shadow:
 
1. Before starting the correction, click once on the Set Black Point 
eyedropper (as shown in Figure 7-11).
 
2. Hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key and click the 
shadow input slider, as shown in Figure 7-11.
 
 When you Alt/Option+click, the clipping preview turns on, revealing the 
darkest area of the image.
 
 If you don’t immediately see a dark area in the clipping preview, you can 
drag the shadow input slider to the left while holding down the Alt/
Option key.
 
3. While still holding down the Alt/Option key, hold down the Shift key 
and click directly on the image in that dark region.
 
 This drops a color sampler on the image that will help you reference 
that point later.

4. Repeat Steps 1–3 with the highlight input slider. Select the Set White 
Point eyedropper in the Curves panel.
 
5. Hold down the Alt/Option key and click the highlight input slider.
 
 Again, you can drag the slider toward the right if the lightest point 
doesn’t immediately show up.
 
 When you locate the lightest point, as indicated by the lightest point in 
the clipping preview, you can (still holding down on the Alt/Option key) 
Shift+click it to drop a second color sampler. See Figure 7-12.

Setting the highlight and shadow values
Now that you’ve determined the lightest and darkest points in the image, set 
their values:
 
1. Set the highlight values by double-clicking the Set White Point eye-
dropper (the white eyedropper on the left side of the Curves panel).
 
 When you double-click the Set White Point eyedropper, the Color Picker 
dialog box appears.
 
2. Enter a generic value for the lightest point in your image: Type 5 
into the Cyan text box, type 3 into the Magenta text box, type 3 into 
the Yellow text box, leave the Black text box at 0 (zero), and then 
click OK.
 
 The Black value helps to correct most images for print and online.
 
3. With the Set White Point eyedropper still selected, click once on the 
color sampler that you dropped on the image, indicating the lightest 
point in the image.
 
 Now, set your shadow point.

444
 
4. Double-click the Set Black Point eyedropper.
 
 The Color Picker dialog box appears.
 
5. Type 65 in the Cyan text box, type 53 in the Magenta text box, 
type 51 in the Yellow text box, type 95 into the Black text box, and 
then click OK.
 
 As with the highlight value, the Black value is a generic value that works 
for most print and online images.
 
6. With the Set Black Point eyedropper still selected, click once on the 
color sampler that you dropped on the image, indicating the darkest 
point in the image.
Adjusting the midtone
You may have heard the statement, “Open up the midtones.” This phrase 
essentially means that you’re lightening the midtonal values of an image. In 
many cases, opening up the midtones is necessary to add contrast and bring 
out detail in your image.
To adjust the midtones, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Curves panel, click the middle of the curve ramp to create an 
anchor point; drag up slightly.
 
 The image lightens. (If you’re in Pigment/Ink % mode, drag down to 
lighten the image.) Don’t move a dramatic amount and be very careful to 
observe what’s happening in your Histogram panel (which you should 
always have open when making color corrections).
 
 Because you set highlight and shadow (see preceding section) and are 
now making a midtone correction, you see the bars in the histogram 
spreading out.
 
2. To adjust the three-quarter tones (the shades around 75 percent), click 
halfway between the bottom of the curve ramp and the midpoint to 
set an anchor point.
 
 Use the grid in the Curves panel to find it easily. (In Pigment/Ink %, the 
three-quarter point is in the upper section of the color ramp.) Adjust 
the three-quarter area of the tone curve up or down slightly to create 
contrast in the image. Again, keep an eye on your histogram!
 
 If you’re working on a grayscale image, your tonal correction is done.
 
 If you’re working on a color image, keep the Curves panel open for the 
final steps, which are outlined in the next section.

Finding a neutral
The last steps in creating a tone curve apply only if you’re working on a 
color image. The key to understanding color is knowing that equal amounts 
of color create gray. By positioning the mouse cursor over gray areas in an 
image and reading the values in the Info panel, you can determine what 
colors you need to adjust.
 
1. With your Curves panel open, position it so that you can see the 
Info panel.
 
 If the Info panel is buried under another panel or a dialog box, choose 
Window➪Info to bring it to the front.
 
2. Position your cursor over your image and, in the Info panel, look for 
the RGB values in the upper-left section.
 
 You see color values and then forward slashes and more color values. 
The numbers before the slash indicate the values in the image before 
you opened the Curves panel; the numbers after the slash show the 
values now that you’ve made changes in the Curves panel. Pay attention 
to the values after the slashes.
 
3. Position the cursor over something gray in your image.
 
 It can be a shadow on a white shirt, a counter top, a road — anything 
that’s a shade of gray. Look at the Info panel. If your image is perfectly 
color balanced, the RGB values following the forward slashes should 
all be the same.
 
4. If your color isn’t balanced, click the Set Gray Point eyedropper in the 
Curves panel and click the neutral or gray area of the image.
 
 The middle eyedropper (Set Gray Point) is a handy way of bringing the 
location that you click closer together in RGB values, thereby balancing 
the colors.
Curves can be as complex or as simple as you make them. As you gain 
more confidence using them, you can check neutrals throughout an image 
to ensure that all unwanted color casts are eliminated. You can even 
individually adjust each color’s curve by selecting it from the Channel 
drop-down list in the Curves panel.
When you’re finished with color correction, using the Unsharp Mask filter 
on your image is a good idea. Chapter 6 of this minibook shows you how 
to use this filter.

Editing an Adjustment Layer
446
Editing an Adjustment Layer
You may go through a curve adjustment only to discover that some areas of 
the image are still too dark or too light. Because you used an adjustment 
layer, you can turn off the correction or change it over and over again with 
no degradation to the quality of the image. Here are the steps you can take if 
you still have additional adjustments to make to an image, such as lightening 
or darkening other parts of the image:
 
1. Select the area of the image that needs adjustments.
 
 See Chapter 4 of this minibook if you need a refresher on how to make 
selections in Photoshop.
 
2. Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather to soften the selection.
 
 The Feather dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a value into the Feather dialog box.
 
 If you’re not sure what value will work best, enter 15 in the Feather 
Radius text field and click OK.
 
 You can also click the Refine Edge button in the Options panel (when 
you have a selection tool active) to preview the feather amount.
 
4. If the Layers panel isn’t visible, choose Windows➪Layers; click 
and hold on the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer icon and 
select Curves.
 
5. In the Curves panel, click the middle of the curve ramp to create an 
anchor point; drag up or down to lighten or darken your selected area.
 
 Notice in the Layers panel (see Figure 7-13) that your adjustment 
layer, Curves 1 by default, has a mask to the right of it. This mask was 
automatically created from your selection. The selected area is white; 
unselected areas are black.

6. With your adjustment layer selected in the Layers panel, use the 
Brush tool to paint white to apply the correction to other areas of the 
image; paint with black to exclude areas from the correction.
 
 You can even change the opacity with the Brush tool in the Options bar 
at the top to apply only some of the correction!
Testing a Printer
If you go through all the work of making color corrections to your images 
and you still get printed images that look hot pink, it may not be you! Test 
your printer by following these steps:
 
1. Create a neutral gray out of equal RGB values (double-click the Fill 
Color swatch in the Tools panel).
 
2. Create a shape, using your neutral gray as the fill color.
 
 For example, you can use the Ellipse tool to create a circle or oval.
 
3. Choose File➪Print and click OK to print the image from your color 
printer.
If you’re seeing heavy color casts, adjust your printer; cleaning or replacing 
the ink cartridge may fix the problem. Check out Chapter 10 of this minibook 
for more about printing your Photoshop files.

Chapter 8: Working with Painting 
and Retouching Tools
In This Chapter
✓ Working in the Swatches panel
✓ Getting to know foreground and background colors
✓ Introducing painting and retouching tools
✓ Discovering blending modes
✓ Saving presets for tools
T
his chapter shows you how to use the painting and retouching tools in 
Photoshop. If you’re unsure about how good the painting you’re about 
to do will look, create a new layer and paint on that. (See Chapter 9 of this 
minibook to find out how to create and use layers.) That way, you can 
delete the layer by dragging it to the Trash Can (at the bottom of the Layers 
panel) if you decide that you don’t like what you’ve done. Don’t forget to 
make the Eraser tool your friend! You can also repair painting or retouch-
ing mistakes by Alt+dragging (Windows) or Option+dragging (Mac) with the 
Eraser tool selected to erase the last version saved or present history state.
Have fun and be creative! Because Photoshop is pixel-based, you can create 
incredible imagery with the painting tools. Smooth gradations from one 
color to the next, integrated with blending modes and transparency, can 
lead from super-artsy to super-realistic effects. In this chapter, you discover 
painting fundamentals, and we show you how to use retouching tools to 
eliminate wrinkles, blemishes, and scratches. Don’t you wish you could do 
that in real life?
Using the Swatches Panel
Use the Swatches panel to store and retrieve frequently used colors. The 
Swatches panel allows you to quickly select colors. The Swatches panel also 
gives you access to many other color options. By using the panel menu, you 
can select from a multitude of different color schemes, such as Pantone or 
Web-safe color sets. These color systems are converted to whatever color 
mode in which you’re working.

Choosing Foreground and Background Colors
450
To sample and store a color for later use, follow these steps:
 
1. To sample a color from an image, select the Eyedropper tool in the 
Tools panel and click a color in the image.
 
 Alternatively, you can use any of the paint tools (the Brush tool, for 
example) and Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac).
 
 The color you click becomes the foreground color.
 
2. If the Swatches panel isn’t already open, choose Window➪Swatches.
 
3. Store the color in the Swatches panel by clicking the New Swatch 
button at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
Anytime you want to use that color again, simply click it in the Swatches 
panel to make it the foreground color.
Choosing Foreground and Background Colors
At the bottom of the Tools panel reside the foreground and background 
color swatches. The foreground color is the color that you apply when using 
any of the painting tools. The background color is the color that you see if 
you erase or delete pixels from the image.
Choose a foreground or background color by clicking the swatch, which 
opens the Color Picker dialog box. To use the Color Picker, you can either 
enter values in the text fields on the right, or you can slide the hue slider.
Pick the hue (color) that you want to start with and then click in the color 
panel to the left to choose the amount of light and saturation (grayness or 
brightness) you want in the color. Select the Only Web Colors check box to 
choose one of the 216 colors in the Web-safe color palette. The hexadecimal 
value used in HTML documents appears in the text field in the lower right of 
the Color Picker.
If you want to quickly save a color, click the Add to Swatches button right in 
the Color Picker.
The Painting and Retouching Tools
Grouped together in the Tools panel are the tools used for painting and 
retouching. The arrow in the lower right of a tool icon indicates that the tool 
has more related hidden tools; simply click and hold on the tool icon to see 
additional painting and retouching tools. In this chapter, we show you how 
to use the Spot Healing Brush, Healing Brush, Patch, Red Eye, Brush, Clone 
Stamp, History Brush, Eraser, and Gradient tools. You also discover ways to 
fill shapes with colors and patterns.

Changing the brush
As you click to select different painting tools, note the Brush menu (second 
from the left) on the Options bar, as shown in Figure 8-1. Click the arrow to open 
the Brushes Preset picker. You can use the Master Diameter slider to make the 
brush size larger or smaller, as well as change the hardness of the brush.
 
The hardness refers to how “fuzzy” the edges are; a softer brush is more 
feathered and soft around the edges, whereas a harder edge is more definite 
(see Figure 8-2).
 
Figure 8-1: 
The Brushes 
Preset 
picker.
 
 
Don’t feel like accessing the Brushes Preset picker every time you want to 
make a change? Press the right bracket ] several times to make your brush 
diameter larger or press the left bracket [ to make the brush diameter smaller. 
Press Shift+] to make the brush harder or Shift+[ to make the brush softer.
Choose Window➪Brushes to see a list of brush presets, plus more brush 
options that you can use to create custom brushes. You can also choose 
other brush libraries with the panel menu. When you select an additional 
library, a dialog box appears, asking whether you want to replace the cur-
rent brushes with the brushes in the selected library. Click the Append 
button to keep existing brushes and add the library to the list, or click OK to 
replace the existing brushes.
 
Access the Brushes Preset picker while you’re painting by right-clicking 
(Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac) anywhere in the image area. Double-
click a brush to select it; press Esc to hide the Brushes Preset picker.

The Spot Healing Brush tool
 
 
The Spot Healing Brush tool is destined to become everyone’s favorite. 
Who wouldn’t love a tool that can remove years from your face and any 
blemishes, too?
The Spot Healing Brush tool quickly removes blemishes and other imperfec-
tions in your images. Click a blemish and watch it paint matching texture, 
lighting, transparency, and shading to the pixels being healed. The Spot 
Healing Brush tool doesn’t require you to specify a sample spot. The Spot 
Healing Brush automatically samples from around the retouched area.
The Healing Brush tool
 
 You can use the Healing Brush tool for repairs, such as eliminating scratches 
and dust from scanned images. The difference between the Spot Healing 
Brush tool and the Healing Brush tool is that a sample spot is required 
before applying the Healing Brush. Follow these steps to use this tool:
 
1. Select the Healing Brush tool in the Tools panel (it’s a hidden tool of 
the Spot Healing Brush tool).
 
2. Find an area in the image that looks good and then Alt-click 
(Windows) or Option-click (Mac) to sample that area.
 
 For example, if you’ll eliminate wrinkles on a face, choose a wrinkle-free 
area of skin near the wrinkle. (Try to keep it relatively close in skin tone.)
 
3. Position the mouse cursor over the area to be repaired and start painting.
 
 The Healing Brush tool goes into action, blending and softening to 
create a realistic repair of the area.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as necessary to repair the blemish, wrinkles, or 
scratches.

The Patch tool
 
 Hidden behind the Healing Brush tool in the Tools panel is the Patch tool. 
Use the Patch tool to repair larger areas, such as a big scratch or a large 
area of skin, by following these steps:
 
1. Click and hold the Healing Brush tool to select the Patch tool; on the 
Options bar, select the Destination radio button.
 
 You can either patch the source area or the destination. The preference 
is really up to you. We recommend taking a good source and dragging it 
over the area that needs repaired.
 
2. With the Patch tool still selected, drag to create a marquee around the 
source that you want to use as the patch.
 
 The source is an unscratched or wrinkle-free area.
 
3. After you create the marquee, drag the selected source area to the 
destination that’s to be repaired.
 
 The Patch tool clones the selected source area while you drag it to the 
destination (the scratched area); when you release the mouse button, 
the tool blends in the source selection and repairs the scratched area!
 
Make the patch look better by choosing Edit➪Fade Patch Selection imme-
diately after you apply the patch. Adjust the opacity until no tell-tale signs 
show that you made a change.
The Red Eye tool
 
 
So you finally got the group together and shot the perfect image, but red eye 
took over! Red eye is caused by a reflection of the camera’s flash in the retina 
of your photo’s subject(s). You see it more often when taking pictures in a 
dark room because the subject’s irises are wide open. If you can, use your 
camera’s red-eye reduction feature. Or, better yet, use a separate flash unit 
that you can mount on the camera farther away from the camera’s lens.
You’ll love the fact that red eye is extremely easy to fix in Photoshop. Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Red Eye tool (hidden behind the Spot Healing Brush tool).
 
2. Click and drag to surround the red eye.
 
 You should see a change immediately, but if you need to make adjust-
ments to the size or the darkness amount, you can change options in the 
Options bar.

The Brush tool
 
 
Painting with the Brush tool in Photoshop is much like painting in the real 
world. What you should know are all the nifty keyboard commands that you can 
use to be much more productive when painting. These shortcuts are really 
great, so make sure that you try them while you read about them. By the way, 
the keyboard commands you see in Table 8-1 work on all the painting tools.

You have several choices of attributes, most of which have dynamic controls 
in the menu options that allow you to vary brush characteristics by tilting or 
applying more pressure to a stylus pen (if you’re using a pressure-sensitive 
drawing tablet), among other things.
 
A warning sign indicates that you don’t have the appropriate device attached 
to use the selected feature, such as a pressure-sensitive drawing tablet.
The following options are available in the Brushes panel:
 
✦ Brush Tip Shape: Select from these standard controls for determining 
brush dimensions and spacing.
 
✦ Shape Dynamics: Change the size of the brush as you paint.
 
✦ Scattering: Scatter the brush strokes and control brush tip count.
 
✦ Texture: Choose from pre-existing patterns or your own.
 
 Create a pattern by selecting an image area with the Rectangular Marquee 
tool. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern, name the pattern, and then click OK. 
The pattern is now available in the Brushes panel’s Texture choices.
 
✦ Dual Brush: Use two brushes at the same time.
 
✦ Color Dynamics: Change the color as you paint.
 
✦ Other Dynamics: Change the opacity and flow.
Here’s what these attributes available in the Options bar do:
 
✦ Noise: Adds a grainy texture to the brush stroke.
 
✦ Wet Edges: Makes the brush stroke appear to be wet by creating a 
heavier amount of color on the edges of the brush strokes.
 
✦ Airbrush: Gives airbrush features to the Brush tools. Enable the 
Airbrush feature by clicking the Airbrush button and adjusting the pres-
sure and flow on the Options bar.
 
 If you click and hold with the Brush tool on the image area, the paint stops 
spreading. Turn on the Airbrush feature and notice that when you click and 
hold, the paint keeps spreading, just like with a can of spray paint. You can 
use the Flow slider on the Options bar to control the pressure.
 
✦ Smoothing: Smoothes the path created with the mouse.
 
✦ Protect Texture: Preserves the texture pattern when applying brush 
presets.

The Painting and Retouching Tools
456
In addition to the preceding options, you can also adjust the jitter of the 
brush. The jitter specifies the randomness of the brush attribute. At 0 per-
cent, an element doesn’t change over the course of a stroke; at 100 percent, 
a stroke will totally vary from one attribute to another. For example, if you 
select Other Dynamics in the Brushes panel and then change the Opacity 
Jitter to 100 percent, the opacity will vary from 0 to 100 percent while you’re 
painting.
After going through all the available brush options, you may want to start 
thinking about how you’ll apply the same attributes later. Saving the Brush 
tool attributes is important as you increase in skill level.
The Clone Stamp tool
 
 
The Clone Stamp tool is used for pixel-to-pixel cloning. It’s different from the 
Healing Brush tool in that it does no automatic blending into the target area. 
You can use the Clone Stamp tool for removing a product name from an 
image, replacing a telephone wire that is crossing in front of a building, or 
duplicating an item.
Here’s how you use the Clone Stamp tool:
 
1. With the Clone Stamp tool selected, position the cursor over the area 
that you want to clone and then Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click 
(Mac) to define the clone source.
 
2. Position the cursor over the area where you want to paint the cloned 
pixels and start painting.
 
 Note the cross hair at the original sampled area, as shown in Figure 8-4. 
While you’re painting, the cross hair follows the pixels that you’re cloning.
 
Figure 8-4: 
A cross 
hair over 
the source 
shows 
what you’re 
cloning.
 
 
When using the Clone Stamp tool for touching up images, it’s best to resample 
many times so as to not leave a seam where you replaced pixels. A good clone 
stamper Alt-clicks (Windows) or Option-clicks (Mac) and paints many times 
over until the retouching is complete.

Choose Window➪Clone Source to open the Clone Source panel, as shown in 
Figure 8-5. With this handy little panel, you can save multiple clone sources 
to refer to while working. Even better, you can scale, preview, and even 
rotate your clone source . . . before you even start cloning!
 
The Clone Source panel can be extremely helpful with difficult retouching 
projects that involve a little more precision.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Additional 
options in 
the Clone 
Source 
panel.
 
Follow these steps to experiment with this fun and interactive panel:
 
1. If the Clone Source panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Clone Source.
 
 
 Note the Clone Source icons across the top. These are yet to be defined. 
The first stamp is selected as a default.
 
 2. Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) in the image area to record 
the first clone source.
 
3. Click the second Clone Source icon at the top of the Clone Source 
panel and then Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) somewhere 
else on the page to define a second clone source.
 
 Repeat as needed to define more clone sources. You can click the Clone 
Source icons at any time to retrieve the clone source and start cloning.
 
4. Enter any numbers you want in the Offset X and Y, W and H, and 
Angle text boxes in the center section of the Clone Source panel to set 
up transformations before you clone.
 
5. Select the Show Overlay check box to see a preview of your clone 
source.
 
 Whatever you plan on doing, it’s much easier to see a preview before you 
start cloning. If you don’t use the Clone Source panel for anything else, 
use it to see a preview of your clone source before you start painting. If it 
helps to see the clone source better, select the Invert check box.
 
 You see an overlay (or preview) prior to cloning. This helps you to align 
your image better, which is great for precision work. If you want the pre-
view to go away after you start cloning, select the Auto Hide check box.

The History Brush tool
Choose Window➪History to see the History panel. You could work for weeks 
playing around in the History panel, but this section gives you the basics.
At the top of the History panel is a snapshot of the last saved version of the 
image. Beside the snapshot is an icon noting that it’s the present History state.
 
 
By default, when you paint with the History Brush tool, it’ll paint back to the 
way the image looked at the last saved version, but you can click the empty 
square to the left of any state in the History panel to make it the target for 
the History Brush tool. Use the History Brush tool to fix errors and add 
spunk to images.
The Eraser tool
 
 
You may not think of the Eraser tool as a painting tool, but it can be! When 
you drag on the image with the Eraser tool, it rubs out pixels to the back-
ground color. (Basically, it paints with the background color.) If you’re drag-
ging with the Eraser tool on a layer, it rubs out pixels to reveal the layer’s 
transparent background. (You can also think of using the Eraser tool as 
painting with transparency.)
The Eraser tool uses all the same commands as the Brush tools. You can 
make an eraser larger, softer, and more or less opaque. But even better, 
follow these steps to use the Eraser tool creatively:
 
1. Open any color image and apply a filter.
 
 For example, we chose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur. In the Gaussian Blur 
dialog box that appeared, we changed the blur to 5 and then clicked OK 
to apply the Gaussian Blur filter.
 
2. Select the Eraser tool and press 5 to change it to 50 percent opacity.
 
 You can also use the Opacity slider on the Options bar.
 
3. Hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key to paint back 50 
percent of the original image’s state before applying the filter.
 
4. Continue painting in the same area to bring the image back to its orig-
inal state!
 
 The original sharpness of the image returns where you painted.
 
Holding down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key is the key command to 
erase to the last saved version (or history state). This tool is incredible for 
fixing mistakes or removing applied filters.

The Gradient tool
 
 Choose the Gradient tool and click and drag across an image area to create a 
gradient in the direction and length of the mouse motion. A short drag cre-
ates a short gradient; a long drag produces a smoother, longer gradient.
With the Options bar, you also can choose the type of gradient that you 
want: Linear, Radial, Angle, Reflected, or Diamond.
As a default, gradients are created using the current foreground and back-
ground colors. Click the arrow on the Gradient button on the Options bar to 
assign a different preset gradient.
To create a gradient, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the Gradient tool and click the Gradient Editor button on the 
Options bar.
 
 The Gradient Editor dialog box appears. At the bottom of the gradient 
preview, you see two or more stops. The stops are where new colors 
are inserted into the gradient. They look like little house icons. Use the 
stops on the top of the gradient slider to determine the opacity.
 
2. Click a stop and click the color swatch to the right of the word Color 
to open the Color Picker and assign a different color to the stop.
 
3. Click anywhere below the gradient preview to add more color stops.
 
4. Drag a color stop off the Gradient Editor dialog box to delete it.
 
5. Click the top of the gradient preview to assign different stops with 
varying opacity, as shown in Figure 8-6.

Blending Modes
460
 
6. When you’re finished editing the gradient, name it and then click the 
New button.
 
 The new gradient is added to the preset gradient choices.
 
7. To apply your gradient, drag across a selection or image with the 
Gradient tool.
Blending Modes
You can use blending modes to add flair to the traditional opaque paint. Use 
blending modes to paint highlights or shadows that allow details to show 
through from the underlying image or to colorize a desaturated image. You 
access the blending modes for paint tools from the Options bar.
You really can’t get a good idea of how the blending mode works with the 
paint color and the underlying color until you experiment. (That’s what 
multiple undos are for!) Alternatively, you can copy the image you want to 
experiment with onto a new layer and hide the original layer; see Chapter 9 
of this minibook for more about layers.
The following list describes the available blending modes:
 
✦ Normal: Paints normally, with no interaction with underlying colors.
 
✦ Dissolve: Gives a random replacement of the pixels, depending on the 
opacity at any pixel location.
 
✦ Behind: Edits or paints only on the transparent part of a layer.
 
✦ Darken: Replaces only the areas that are lighter than the blend color. 
Areas darker than the blend color don’t change.
 
✦ Multiply: Creates an effect similar to drawing on the page with magic 
markers. Also looks like colored film that you see on theater lights.
 
✦ Color Burn: Darkens the base color to reflect the blend color. If you’re 
using white, no change occurs.
 
✦ Linear Burn: Looks at the color information in each channel and 
darkens the base color to reflect the blending color by decreasing the 
brightness.
 
✦ Darker Color: Compares the total of all channel values for the blend and 
base color and displays the lower value color.
 
✦ Lighten: Replaces only the areas darker than the blend color. Areas 
lighter than the blend color don’t change.

Blending Modes
461
 
✦ Screen: Multiplies the inverse of the underlying colors. The resulting 
color is always a lighter color.
 
✦ Color Dodge: Brightens the underlying color to reflect the blend color. If 
you’re using black, there’s no change.
 
✦ Linear Dodge: Looks at the color information in each channel and 
brightens the base color to reflect the blending color by increasing the 
brightness.
 
✦ Lighter Color: Compares the total of all channel values for the blend and 
base color and displays the higher value color.
 
✦ Overlay: Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the base color.
 
✦ Soft Light: Darkens or lightens the colors, depending on the blend color. 
The effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the artwork.
 
✦ Hard Light: Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the blend 
color. The effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the artwork.
 
✦ Vivid Light: Burns or dodges the colors by increasing or decreasing the 
contrast.
 
✦ Linear Light: Burns or dodges the colors by decreasing or increasing 
the brightness.
 
✦ Pin Light: Replaces the colors, depending on the blend color.
 
✦ Hard Mix: Paints strokes that have no effect with other Hard Mix paint 
strokes. Use this mode when you want no interaction between the colors.
 
✦ Difference: Subtracts either the blend color from the base color or the 
base color from the blend color, depending on which has the greater 
brightness value. The effect is similar to a color negative.
 
✦ Exclusion: Creates an effect similar to, but with less contrast than, the 
Difference mode.
 
✦ Hue: Applies the hue (color) of the blend object onto the underlying 
objects but keeps the underlying shading or luminosity intact.
 
✦ Saturation: Applies the saturation of the blend color but uses the lumi-
nance and hue of the base color.
 
✦ Color: Applies the blend object’s color to the underlying objects but 
preserves the gray levels in the artwork. This mode is great for tinting 
objects or changing their colors.
 
✦ Luminosity: Creates a resulting color with the hue and saturation of the 
base color and the luminance of the blend color. This mode is the oppo-
site of the Color mode.

Blending Modes
462
Painting with color
This section provides an example of using the blending modes to change and 
add color to an image. A great example of using a blending mode is tinting a 
black-and-white (grayscale) image with color. You can’t paint color in Grayscale 
mode, so follow these steps to add color to a black-and-white image:
 
1. Open an image in any color mode and choose Image➪Mode➪RGB.
 
2. If the image isn’t already a grayscale image, choose 
Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate.
 
 This feature makes it appear as though the image is black and white, but 
you’re still in a color mode with which you can apply color.
 
3. Choose a painting tool (the Brush tool, for example) and, with the 
Swatches panel, choose the first color that you want to paint with.
 
4. On the Options bar, select Color from the Mode drop-down list and 
then use the Opacity slider to change the opacity to 50 percent.
 
 You could also just type 5.
 
5. Start painting!
 
 The Color Blending mode is used to change the color of the pixels, while 
keeping the underlying grayscale (shading) intact.
 
Another way to bring attention to a certain item in an RGB image (like 
those cute greeting cards that have the single rose in color and every-
thing else in black and white) is to select the item you want to bring 
attention to. Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather to soften the selection a 
bit (5 pixels is a good number to enter in the Feather Radius text field). 
Then choose Select➪Inverse. Now with everything else selected, choose 
Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate. Everything else in the image looks black 
and white, except for the original item that you selected.
Filling selections
If you have a definite shape that doesn’t lend itself to being painted, you can 
fill it with color instead. Make a selection and choose Edit➪Fill to access 
the Fill dialog box. From the Use drop-down list, you can choose from the 
following options to fill the selection: Foreground Color, Background Color, 
Color (to open the Color Picker while in the Fill dialog box), Pattern, History, 
Black, 50% Gray, or White.
If you want to use an existing or saved pattern from the Brushes panel, you 
can retrieve a pattern by selecting Pattern in the Fill dialog box as well. 
Select History from the Use drop-down list to fill with the last version saved 
or the history state.

Saving Presets
463
 
 If you’d rather use the Paint Bucket tool, which fills based upon the toler-
ance set on the Options bar, it’s hidden in the Gradient tool. To use the Paint 
Bucket tool to fill with the foreground color, simply click the item that you 
want to fill.
Saving Presets
All the Photoshop tools allow you to save presets so that you can retrieve 
them from a list of presets. The following steps show you an example of 
saving a Brush tool preset, but the same method can be used for all other 
tools as well:
 
1. Choose a brush size, color, softness, or anything!
 
2. Click the Tool Preset Picker button on the left side of the Options bar.
 
3. Click the triangle in the upper-right corner to access the fly-out menu 
and then choose New Tool Preset.
 
 The New Tool Preset dialog box appears.
 
4. Type a descriptive name in the Name text field (leave the Include 
Color check box selected if you want the preset to also remember the 
present color) and then click OK.
 
5. Access the preset by clicking the tool’s Preset Picker button and 
choosing it from the tool’s Preset Picker list.
Each preset that you create is specific to the tool that it was created in, so 
you can have a crop preset, an eraser preset, and so on. After you get in the 
habit of saving presets, you’ll wonder how you ever got along without them!

Chapter 9: Using Layers
In This Chapter
✓ Discovering layers
✓ Using text as a layer
✓ Implementing layer masks
✓ Organizing layers
✓ Using Smart Objects
✓ Using 3D layers to create 3D objects
✓ Merging and flattening a layered image
L
ayers are incredibly helpful in production. By using layers, you can make 
realistic additions to an image that you can remove, edit, and control 
with blending modes and transparency. Unfortunately, to show you all the 
features of layers goes beyond what we can cover in this chapter. This chap-
ter covers layer basics to get you started working with layers in Photoshop. 
We show you how to create composite images using easy layer features — 
just enough knowledge to get yourself into a pretty complex mess of layers! 
Even if you’re an experienced Photoshop user, read this chapter to discover 
all sorts of neat key commands that can help you in your workflow.
If you’re a video professional, you can open videos in Photoshop CS4. 
Photoshop Extended automatically creates a Movie layer, and with the 
Timeline, you can do pixel editing frame by frame!
New in Photoshop CS4 Extended, you can make regular layers into 3D files! 
Though many of the 3D features are beyond the scope of this book, you can dis-
cover enough to be dangerous in the “Experimenting with 3D Files” section.
 
Have fun with layers and don’t worry if you mess up; you can always press 
F12 to revert the image to the state it was in at the last time you saved it.
Creating and Working with Layers
Layers make creating composite images (images pieced together from many 
other individual images) easy because you can separate individual elements 
of the composite onto their own layers. Much like creating collages by cut-
ting pictures from magazines, you can mask out selections on one image and 

Creating and Working with Layers

place them on a layer in another image. When pixel information is on its own 
layer, you can move it, transform it, correct its color, or apply filters just to 
that layer, without disturbing pixel information on other layers.
The best way to understand how to create and use layers is to, well, create and 
use layers. The following steps show you how to create a new, layered image:
 
1. Choose File➪New to create a new document.
 
 The New dialog box appears.
 
2. Select Default Photoshop Size from the Preset Sizes drop-down list, 
select the Transparent option from the Background Contents area, and 
then click OK.
 
 Because you selected the Transparent option, your image opens with an 
empty layer instead of a white background layer. The image appears as a 
checkerboard pattern, which signifies that it’s transparent.
 
 If you don’t like to see the default checkerboard pattern where there’s 
transparency, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Transparency and Gamut 
(Windows) or Photoshop➪Preferences➪Transparency and Gamut (Mac). 
In the Preferences dialog box that appears, you can change the Grid Size 
drop-down list to None to remove the checkerboard pattern entirely. If you 
don’t want to totally remove the transparency grid, you can change the size 
of the checkerboard pattern or change the color of the checkerboard.
 
 When you open an existing document (say a photograph), this image is 
your background layer.
 
3. Create a shape on the new image.
 
 For example, we created a black square by using the Rectangular 
Marquee tool to create a square selection; we then filled the selection 
with black by double-clicking the Foreground color swatch, selecting 
black from the Color Picker, and clicking in the selection with the Paint 
Bucket tool (hidden under the Gradient tool).
 
 After you select the color, you can also use the key command Alt+Delete 
(Windows) or Option+Delete (Mac) to fill the selected area with color.
 
4. To rename the layer, double-click the layer name (Layer 1) in the 
Layers panel and type a short, descriptive name.
 
 A good practice is to name your layers based on what they contain; for 
this example, we named the layer we created in Step 3 with the catchy 
name square.
 
 
5. Create a new layer by Alt-clicking (Windows) or Option-clicking (Mac) 
the New Layer button at the bottom of the Layers panel.
 
 The New Layer dialog box appears.
 
6. Give your new layer a descriptive name and then click OK.
 
7. Create a shape on the new layer.

 We created a red circle by using the Elliptical Marquee tool and filling 
the selection with red.
 
 The new shape can overlap the shape on the other layer, as shown in 
Figure 9-1.
 
Figure 9-1: 
The circle 
overlaps the 
square.
 
Duplicating a layer
Perhaps you want to create a duplicate of a layer for your composite. This 
technique can be helpful for do-it-yourself drop shadows, as well as adding 
elements to an image, such as more apples in a bowl of fruit.
 
 Alt+drag (Windows) or Option+drag (Mac) a layer to the New Layer button 
at the bottom of the Layers panel to duplicate it. Again, by holding down Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac), you can name the layer while you create it.
Selecting a layer
When you start working with layers, you may find yourself moving or adjust-
ing pixels, only to discover that you accidentally edited pixels on the wrong 
layer. Select the layer that you plan to work on by clicking the layer name in 
the Layers panel.
 
Unlike previous versions of Photoshop, Photoshop CS4 represents a selected 
layer by simply highlighting the layer in the Layers panel. The indicator 
paintbrush icon is gone in this version.

Creating a Text Layer
468
Here are some tips to help you select the correct layer:
 
✦ Select the Move tool and then right-click (Windows) or Control-click 
(Mac) to see a contextual menu listing all layers that have pixel data at the 
point you clicked and to choose the layer that you want to work with.
 
✦ Get in the habit of holding down the Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) key while 
using the Move tool and when selecting layers. This technique temporar-
ily turns on the Auto Select feature, which automatically selects the top-
most visible layer that contains the pixel data that you clicked.
 
✦ Press Alt+[ (Windows) or Option+[ (Mac) to select the next layer down 
from the selected layer in the stacking order.
 
✦ Press Alt+] (Windows) or Option+] (Mac) to select the next layer up 
from the selected layer in the stacking order.
Controlling the visibility of a layer
Hide layers that you don’t immediately need by clicking the Eye icon in the 
Layers panel. To see only one layer, Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click 
(Mac) the eye icon of the layer you want to keep visible. Alt-click (Windows) 
or Option-click (Mac) the Eye icon again to show all layers.
Rearranging the stacking order
Layers are like clear pieces of film lying on top of each other. Change the stack-
ing order of the layers in the Layers panel by dragging a layer until you see a 
black separator line appear, indicating that you’re dragging the layer to that 
location. You can also use these great commands to help you move a layer:
Command

Creating a Text Layer
When you create text in Photoshop, the text is created on its own layer. 
By having the text separate from the rest of your image, applying different 
styles and blending modes to customize the type, as well as repositioning 
the text, is simplified.

Using Layer Masks
In this section, we show you how to create a layer mask from a selection or 
a pen path. A layer mask covers up areas of the image that you want to make 
transparent and exposes pixels that you want visible. Masks can be based 
upon a selection that you’ve created with the selection tools, by painting on 
the mask itself, or by using the Pen tool to create a path around the object 
you want to keep visible.
Creating a layer mask from a selection
You need to have two images open to follow these steps where we show you 
how to create layer masks from a selection:
 
1. When combining images, choose Image➪Image Size to make sure that 
the images are approximately the same resolution.
 
 Otherwise, you may create some interesting, but disproportional, 
effects.

2. With the Move tool, click one image and drag it to the other image 
window.
 
 A black border appears around the image area when dropping an image 
into another image window. By dragging and dropping an image, you 
automatically create a new layer on top of the active layer.
 
 Hold down the Shift key when dragging one image to another to per-
fectly center the new image layer in the document window.
 
3. With any selection method, select a part of the image that you want to 
keep on the newly placed layer and choose Select➪Modify➪Feather to 
soften the selection (5 pixels should be enough).
 
 4. Click the Layer Mask button at the bottom of the Layers panel.
 
 
 A mask is created off to the right of your layer, leaving only your selection 
visible, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
5. If you click the Layer thumbnail in the Layers panel, the mask thumb-
nail shows corner edges, indicating that it is activated.
 
 While the layer mask is active, you can paint on the mask.
 
6. Press D to return to the default black-and-white swatch colors in the 
Tools panel.
 
7. Select the Brush tool and paint black while the mask thumbnail is 
selected to cover up areas of the image that you don’t want to see; 
press X to switch to white and paint to expose areas on the image that 
you do want to see.
 
 You can even change the opacity while you paint to blend images in with 
each other.

Organizing Your Layers
472
 
To create a smooth transition from one image to another, drag the Gradient 
tool across the image while the layer mask is selected in the Layers panel.
Creating a vector mask from a pen path
A vector mask masks a selection, but it does so with the precision that 
you can get only from using a path. The following steps show you another, 
slightly more precise, way to create a layer mask by using a pen path:
 
1. Use the Pen tool and click from point to point to make a closed pen path.
 
 If you already have a path, choose Windows➪Paths and click a path to 
select it.
 
 See Chapter 5 of this minibook for more about working with the Pen tool.
 
2. On the Layers panel, click the Layer Mask button and then click it again.
 
 Wow! A mask from your pen path! Anything that wasn’t contained within 
the path is now masked out. Use the Direct Selection tool to edit the 
path, if necessary.
If you no longer want a vector mask, drag the thumbnail to the Trash Can in 
the Layers panel. An Alert dialog box appears, asking if you want to discard 
the mask or apply it. Click the Discard button to revert your image to the 
way it appeared before applying the mask or click the Apply button to apply 
the masked area.
Organizing Your Layers
As you advance in layer skills, you’ll want to keep layers named, neat, and in 
order. In this section, we show you some tips to help you organize multiple 
layers.
Activating multiple layers simultaneously
Select multiple layers simultaneously by selecting one layer and then Shift-
clicking to select additional layers. The selected layers are highlighted. 
Selected layers will move and transform together, making repositioning and 
resizing easier than activating each layer independently.
Select multiple layers to keep their relative positions to each other and take 
advantage of alignment features. When you select two or more layers and 
choose the Move tool, you can take advantage of alignment features on the 
Options bar (see Figure 9-4). Select three or more layers for distribution options.

Ever have multiple shots of a group, one with the guy’s eyes shut, and the 
girl looking the other way? Or maybe you like the smile in one better than in 
another. With the auto-alignment feature, you can pull the best parts of mul-
tiple images into one “best” image.
To use this new tool, simply have the Move tool active, select multiple 
layers, and then click the Auto-Align Layers button to the right of the align-
ment tools. The Auto-Align Layer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-5; 
make your selection and click OK.

Organizing Your Layers
474
Layer groups
After you start using layers, you’ll likely use lots of them, and your Layers 
panel will become huge. If you find yourself scrolling to navigate from one 
layer to another, take advantage of layer groups, which essentially act as 
folders that hold layers that you choose. Just like a folder you use for paper, 
you can add, remove, and shuffle around the layers within a layer group. Use 
layer groups to organize your layers and make the job of duplicating mul-
tiple layers easier.
To create a layer group, follow these steps:
 
1. After creating several layers, Shift-click to select the layers that you 
want to group together in a set.
 
2. Choose New Group from Layers from the Layers panel menu, name 
the group, and then click OK.
 
 That’s it. You’ve created a layer group from your selected layers.
 
With the Blending Mode drop-down list in the Layers panel, you can change 
all the layers within a group to a specific blending mode, or you can use the 
Opacity slider to change the opacity of all layers in a group at once. Pass 
through in the blending mode indicates that no individual blending modes 
are changed.
After you create a layer group, you can still reorganize layers within the 
group or even drag additional layers in or out. You can open and close a 
layer group with the arrow to the left of the group name.
Duplicating a layer group
After you create a layer group, you may want to copy it. For example, you 
may want to copy an image, such as a button created from several layers 
topped off with a text layer. The most efficient way to make a copy of that 
button is to create a layer group and copy the entire group. To copy an 
image made up of several layers that aren’t in a layer group would require 
you to individually duplicate each layer — how time-consuming!
To duplicate a layer group, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a group from the Layers panel.
 
2. From the panel menu, choose Duplicate Group.
 
 The Duplicate Group dialog box appears.
 
3. For the destination, choose the present document or any open docu-
ment or create a new document.
 
 Be sure to give the duplicated set a distinctive name!
 
4. Click OK.

Using Layer Styles
475
Using Layer Styles
Layer styles are wonderful little extras that you can apply to layers to create 
drop shadows, bevel and emboss effects, apply color overlays, gradients, 
patterns and strokes, and more.
Applying a style
To apply a layer style (for example, the drop shadow style, one of the most 
popular effects) to an image, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a layer on any image.
 
 For example, you could create a text layer to see the effects of the layer 
styles.
 
2. With the layer selected, click and hold the Layer Style button at the 
bottom of the Layers panel; from the menu options, choose Drop 
Shadow.
 
 In the Layer Style dialog box that appears, you can choose to change the 
blending mode, color, distance spread, and size of a drop shadow. You 
should see the style has already applied to your text. Position the cursor 
on the image area and drag to visually adjust the position of the drop 
shadow.
 
3. When you’re happy with the drop shadow, click OK to apply it.
 
To apply another effect and change its options, click and hold the Layer 
Style button in the Layers panel and choose the name of the layer style from 
the menu that appears — Bevel and Emboss, for example. In the dialog box 
that appears, change the settings to customize the layer style and click OK 
to apply it to your image. For example, if you choose Bevel and Emboss 
from the Layer Styles menu, you can choose from several emboss styles and 
adjust the depth, size, and softness.
Here are some consistent items that you see in the Layer Style dialog box, no 
matter what effect you choose:
 
✦ Contour: Use contours to control the shape and appearance of an effect. 
Click the arrow to open the Contour fly-out menu to choose a contour 
preset or click the contour preview to open the Contour Editor and 
create your own edge.
 
✦ Angle: Drag the cross hair in the angle circle or enter a value in the 
Angle text field to control where the light source comes from.
 
✦ Global light: If you aren’t smart about lighting effects on multiple 
objects, global light makes it seem as though you are. Select the Use 
Global Light check box to keep the angle consistent from one layer style 
to another.

Using Layer Styles
476
 
✦ Color: Whenever you see a color box, you can click it to select a color. 
This color can be for the drop shadow, highlight, or shadow of an 
emboss, or for a color overlay.
Creating and saving a style
If you come up with a combination of attributes that you like, click the New 
Style button in the upper right of the Layer Style dialog box. Name the style, 
and it’s now stored in the Styles panel. After you click OK, you can retrieve 
the style at any time by choosing Window➪Styles. If it helps, click the panel 
menu button and choose either Small or Large List to change the Styles 
panel to show only the name of the styles.
After you apply a layer style to a layer, the style is listed in the Layers panel. 
You can turn off the visibility of the style by turning off the Eye icon or even 
throw away the layer style by dragging it to the Layers panel’s Trash Can.
Thinking about opacity versus fill
In the Layers panel, you have two transparency options — one for opacity and 
one for fill. Opacity affects the opacity of the entire layer, including effects. Fill, 
on the other hand, affects only the layer itself, but not layer styles. Figure 9-6 
shows what happens when the Bevel and Emboss style is applied to text and 
the fill is reduced to 0 percent — it looks like the text was embossed onto the 
image. You can do lots of neat stuff with the Layer Fill feature!

Smart, Really Smart! Smart Objects
477
Smart, Really Smart! Smart Objects
Choose File➪Place and place an image, illustration, or even a movie into a 
Photoshop document and discover that, as always, a new layer is created, 
but even better than that, a Smart Object is created. The icon in the lower 
right of the layer thumbnail indicates that this layer is a Smart Object.
What does being a Smart Object mean? It means that you have much more 
flexibility with the placement of your images. Have you ever placed a logo, 
to find out later you need it to be three times the size? Resizing is no longer 
an issue, as the Photoshop Smart Object is linked to an embedded original. 
If the original is vector, you can freely resize the image over and over again 
without worrying about poor resolution. Want to change the spelling of your 
placed Illustrator logo? Just double-click the Smart Object, and the embed-
ded original is opened right in Adobe Illustrator. Make your changes, save 
the file, and voilà . . . the file’s automatically updated in the Photoshop file.
What could be better than this? Smart Filters, of course. You can apply 
Smart Filters to any Smart Object layer, or even convert a layer to use Smart 
Filters, by choosing Filters➪Convert for Smart Filters. After a layer’s been 
converted to a Smart Object, you can choose filters, any filters, and apply 
them to the layer. If you want to paint out the effects of the filter on the 
layer, simply paint with black on the Filter Effects thumbnail. Paint with dif-
ferent opacities of black and white to give an artistic feel to the filter effect, 
as shown in Figure 9-7. You can even turn off the filters by turning off the 
visibility on the Filter Effects thumbnail by clicking the Eye icon to the left of 
the Filter Effects thumbnail.

Experimenting with 3D Files
As previously mentioned, working with 3D files is beyond the scope of this 
book, but even a 3D novice can experiment with the new 3D features imple-
mented in Photoshop CS4. Follow these steps to try out some 3D features on 
your own:
 
1. Create a new Photoshop document.
 
 You can choose the Default Photoshop Size, but make sure that the 
Background Contents drop-down list is set to Transparent.
 
2. Select the Type tool, click in the image area, and type any word.
 
 In this example, we typed 3D.
 
3. Select the Move tool.
 
4. Choose 3D➪Create New 3D Postcard from Layer.
 
 The image looks like it’s now on a perspective plane. Also, note that the 
type layer now has a 3D icon on the layer thumbnail in the Layers panel, 
as shown in Figure 9-8, indicating that this is now a 3D layer.
 
 5. Experiment with angle and positioning by clicking and dragging on 
your 3D layer with the 3D Rotate tool and the 3D Orbit tool.
 
 
 Notice that these tools have additional options available in the Options 
bar across the top of your Photoshop document.

Merging and Flattening the Image
Merging layers combines several selected layers into one layer. Flattening is 
when you reduce all layers to one background layer. Layers can increase 
your file in size, thereby also tying up valuable processing resources. To 
keep file size down, you may choose to merge some layers or even flatten 
the entire image down to one background layer.

Book IV
Chapter 9
Using Layers
Merging and Flattening the Image
479
Merging
Merging layers is helpful when you no longer need every layer to be indepen-
dent, like when you have a separate shadow layer aligned to another layer 
and don’t plan on moving it again, or when you combine many layers to 
create a composite and want to consolidate it to one layer.
To merge layers (in a visual and easy way), follow these steps:
 
1. Turn on the visibility of only the layers that you want merged.
 
2. Choose Merge Visible from the Layers panel menu.
 
 That’s it. The entire image isn’t flattened, but the visible layers are now 
reduced to one layer.
 
To merge visible layers onto a target (selected) layer that you create while 
keeping the visible layers independent, do the following: Create a blank layer 
and select it. Hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) when choosing 
Merge Visible from the panel menu.
Flattening
If you don’t have to flatten your image, don’t! Flattening your image reduces 
all layers to one background layer, which is necessary for certain file for-
mats, but after you flatten an image, you can’t take advantage of blending 
options or reposition the layered items. (Read more about saving files in 
Chapter 10 of this minibook.)
 
If you absolutely must flatten layers, keep a copy of the original, unflattened 
document for additional edits in the future.
To flatten all layers in an image, choose Layer➪Flatten Image or choose 
Flatten Image from the panel menu on the Layers panel.

Chapter 10: Saving Photoshop 
Images for Print and the Web
In This Chapter
✓ Determining the correct file formats for saving
✓ Preparing your images for the Web
✓ Discovering the color table
✓ Saving your settings
A
 productive workflow depends on you choosing the proper format in 
which to save your Photoshop files. Without the correct settings, your 
file may not be visible to other applications, or you may delete valuable 
components, such as layers or saved selections. This chapter provides you 
with the necessary information to save the file correctly for both print and 
the Web. We cover the file format choices before moving on to the proper 
use of the Save for Web & Devices feature (for saving in the GIF, JPEG, PNG, 
and WBMP file formats).
 
Saving files in the correct file format is important not only for file size, but 
in support of different Photoshop features, as well. If you’re unsure about 
saving in the right format, save a copy of the file, keeping the original in 
the PSD format (the native Photoshop format). Photoshop alerts you auto-
matically when you choose a format in the Save As or the Save for Web & 
Devices dialog box that doesn’t support Photoshop features. When you 
choose a format that doesn’t support some of the features you’ve used, 
such as channels or layers, a yield sign appears when a copy is being made. 
Now with the ability of all the Adobe applications (and even non-Adobe 
applications) to read native Photoshop (.psd) files, it’s wise to keep files in 
this native file format unless there’s a compelling reason not to.
Choosing a File Format for Saving
When you choose File➪Save for the first time (or you choose File➪Save As 
to save a different version of a file), you see at least 18 different file formats 
that you can choose from in the Save as Type drop-down list. We don’t 
cover each format in this chapter (some are specific to proprietary work-
flows), but we do show you which formats are best for the typical workflow 
that you may face.

Choosing a File Format for Saving
482
Wonderful and easy Photoshop PSD
If you’re in an Adobe workflow (you’re using any Adobe products), you can 
keep the image in the native Photoshop PSD format. By choosing this format, 
transparency, layers, channels, and paths are all maintained and left intact 
when placed in the other applications.
If compatibility with older versions of Photoshop is an issue, choose Edit➪
Preferences➪File Handling (Windows) or Photoshop➪Preferences➪File 
Handling (Mac). Choose Always from the Maximize PSD and PSB File 
Compatibility drop-down list. This choice saves a composite (flattened) 
image along with the layers of your document. (PSB is a format used for 
saving large Photoshop documents over 30,000 by 30,000 pixels in size.)
 
Leaving the Maximize PSD and PSB File Compatibility drop-down list set to 
Always creates a larger file. If file size is an issue, leave the drop-down list 
set to Ask and only use the feature when you need to open the Photoshop 
file in older versions of Photoshop.
Photoshop EPS
Virtually every desktop application accepts the EPS (Encapsulated 
PostScript) file format. The EPS format is used to transfer PostScript-
language artwork between various applications. It supports vector data, 
duotones, and clipping paths.
When you choose to save in the EPS format, an EPS Options dialog box 
appears. Leave the defaults and click OK.
 
Alter the settings in the EPS Options dialog box only if you’re familiar with 
custom printer calibration, or if you need to save your image to a specific 
screen ruling. Screen rulings (lpi, lines per inch) are usually set in a page 
layout application, such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress.
Photoshop PDF
If compatibility is an issue, save your file in the Photoshop PDF (Portable 
Document Format) format. PDF files are supported by more than a dozen 
platforms when viewers use Acrobat or Adobe Reader. (Adobe Reader is 
available for free at www.adobe.com.) What a perfect way to send pictures 
to friends and family! Saving your file in the Photoshop PDF format supports 
your ability to edit the image when you open the file by choosing File➪Open 
in Photoshop.
 
If you’re planning to send a layered file by e-mail, it’s a good idea to select 
Layer➪Flatten Layers before choosing to save the file as a PDF. This cuts the 
file size considerably.

TIFF
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a flexible bitmap image format that’s sup-
ported by most image-editing and page-layout applications widely supported 
by all printers. TIFF supports layers and channels, but it has a maximum size 
of 4GB. We hope your files aren’t that large!
DCS
The Photoshop DCS (Desktop Color Separation) 1.0 and 2.0 formats are 
versions of EPS that enable you to save color separations of CMYK (Cyan, 
Magenta, Yellow, Black) or multichannel files. Some workflows require this 
format, but if you’ve implemented spot color channels in your image, using 
the DCS file format is required to maintain them.
Choose the DCS 2.0 format unless you received specific instructions to use 
the DCS 1.0 format — for example, for reasons of incompatibility in certain 
workflows.
Saving for the Web and Devices
To access the maximum number of options for the GIF, JPEG, PNG, and 
WBMP file formats, save your image by choosing File➪Save for Web & 
Devices. The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears, which allows you 
to optimize the image as you save it. This procedure may sound big, but it’s 
just the process of making the image as small as possible while keeping it 
visually pleasing.
Saving images for the Web is a give-and-take experience. You may find yourself 
sacrificing perfect imagery to make the image small enough in size that it can 
be downloaded and viewed quickly by users. Read the upcoming sections on 
GIF and JPEG formats to see how you can best handle creating Web images.
The following sections describe the differences between GIF, JPEG, PNG, and 
WBMP. Choose the appropriate format based upon the type of image you’re 
saving.
 
Having the image size correct before you save the file for the Web is a good 
practice. If you need to read up on resizing images, see Chapter 6 of this 
minibook. Generally speaking, you want to resize the image to the right pixel 
dimensions. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask to gain back some of 
the detail lost when resizing the image and then save the image for the Web.

GIF
Supposedly, the way you pronounce GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is 
based on the type of peanut butter you eat. Is it pronounced like the peanut 
butter brand (Jiff), or with a hard G, like gift? Most people seem to pro-
nounce it like gift (minus the T).
Use the GIF format if you have large areas of solid color, such as a logo like 
the one shown in Figure 10-1.
 
Figure 10-1: 
An image 
with lots of 
solid color 
makes a 
good GIF.
 
The GIF format isn’t lossy (it doesn’t lose data when the file is compressed in 
this format), but it does reduce the file size by using a limited number of colors 
in a color table. The lower the number of colors, the smaller the file size. If 
you’ve ever worked in the Index color mode, you’re familiar with this process.
Transparency is supported by the GIF file format. Generally, GIFs don’t do 
a good job with anything that needs smooth transitions from one color 
to another because of its poor support of anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing is the 
method that Photoshop uses to smooth jagged edges. When an image tran-
sitions from one color to another, Photoshop produces multiple colors of 
pixels to create an even blend between the two colors.
Because anti-aliasing needs to create multiple colors for this effect, GIF 
files are generally not recommended. In fact, when you reduce a GIF in size, 
you’re more apt to see banding because the anti-aliasing can’t take place 
with the limited number of colors available in the GIF format.
You can, of course, dramatically increase the number of colors to create a 
smoother transition, but then you risk creating monster files that take for-
ever to download.
Saving a GIF
When you choose File➪Save For Web & Devices, you first see the available 
GIF format options. The GIF options may be more clear to you if you have an 
image (with lots of solid color) open.

To save a file for the Web as a GIF, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save for Web & Devices.
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. At the top, click the 2-Up tab.
 
 You see the original image on the left and the optimized image on the 
right (or top and bottom, depending upon the proportions of your image).
 
 In the lower portion of the display, you see the original file size com-
pared to the optimized file size, as well as the approximate download 
time. This time is important! Nobody wants to wait around for a Web 
page to load; most people won’t wait more than ten seconds for the 
entire Web page to appear, so try to keep an individual image’s down-
load time down to five seconds or less. Remember, all the images on a 
page can add up to one monstrous wait time for the viewer!
 
 Change the download speed by choosing from the Preview menu (it’s 
the arrow on the upper-right side of the Save for Web & Devices dialog 
box). The Preview menu isn’t labeled, so look for the ToolTip to appear 
when you hover your cursor over the arrow icon.
 
3. Choose GIF 32 No Dither from the Preset drop-down list.
 
 You may see a change already. Photoshop supplies you with presets 
that you can choose from, or you can customize and save your own.
 
4. Choose whether you want dithering applied to the image by selecting 
an option from the Specify the Dither Algorithm drop-down list.
 
 This choice is purely personal. Because you may be limiting colors, 
Photoshop can use dithering to mix the pixels of the available colors to 
simulate the missing colors. Many designers choose the No Dither option 
because dithering can create unnatural color speckles in your image.
 
5. If your image is on a transparent layer and you want to maintain that 
transparency on a Web page, select the Transparency check box.
Using the color table in the Save 
for Web & Devices dialog box
When you save an image as a GIF using the Save for Web & Devices dialog 
box, you see the color table for the image on the right side of the dialog box. 
The color table is important because it not only allows you to see the colors 
used in the image, but also enables you to customize the color table by using 
the options at the bottom of the color table.
You may want to customize your color table by selecting some of your 
colors to be Web safe and locking colors so that they’re not bumped off as 
you reduce the amount of colors.

Saving for the Web and Devices
486
To customize a color table, follow these steps:
 
1. If your image has only a few colors that you want to convert to Web-
safe colors, choose the Eyedropper tool from the left of the Save for 
Web & Devices dialog box and click the color, in the Optimized view.
 
 The sampled color is highlighted in the color table.
 
2. Click the Web Safe button at the bottom of the color table.
 
 A ToolTip appears when you cross over this button with the text Shifts/
Unshifts Selected Colors to Web panel.
 
 A diamond appears, indicating that the color is now Web safe.
 
3. Lock colors that you don’t want to delete as you reduce the number of 
colors in the color table.
 
 Select a color with the Eyedropper tool or choose it in the color table 
and then click the Lock Color button. A white square appears in the 
lower-right corner, indicating that the color is locked.
 
 If you lock 32 colors and then reduce the color table to 24, some of your 
locked colors are deleted. If you choose to add colors, those locked 
colors are the first to return.
 
 How is the color table created? Based upon a color reduction algorithm 
method that you choose, the Save for Web & Devices feature samples 
the number of colors that you indicate. If keeping colors Web safe is 
important, select the Restrictive (Web) option for the method; if you 
want your image to look better on most monitors but not necessarily be 
Web safe, choose the Adaptive option.
 
4. Use the arrows to the right of the Colors combo box or enter a number 
to add or delete colors from the color table.
 
5. If your image uses transparency, select the Transparency check box.
 
 Remember that transparency is counted as one of your colors in the 
color table.
 
6. Select the Interlaced check box only if your GIF image is large in size 
(25K or larger).
 
 Selecting this option causes the image to build in several scans on the 
Web page, a low-resolution image that pops up quickly to be refreshed 
with the higher resolution image when it’s finished downloading. 
Interlacing gives the illusion of the download going faster but makes the 
file size larger, so use it only if necessary.
 
7. Click Save.
 
 Now the image is ready to be attached to an e-mail message or used in a 
Web page.

JPEG
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is the best format for continuous 
tone images (those with smooth transitions from one color to another, as in 
photographs), like the image shown in Figure 10-2.
 
The JPEG format is lossy, so you shouldn’t save a JPEG, open it, edit it, and 
save it again as a JPEG. Because the JPEG compression causes data to be 
lost, your image will eventually look like it was printed on a paper towel. 
Save a copy of the file as a JPEG, keeping the original image in the PSD 
format if you need to later edit the image, open the original PSD, make your 
changes, save the PSD, and then save a copy of the edited file as a JPEG.
The JPEG format does not support transparency, but you can cheat the 
system a little by using matting.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Images with 
smooth 
transitions 
from one 
color to 
another 
are good 
candidates 
for the JPEG 
file format.
 
A good image to save in the JPEG format is a typical photograph or illustra-
tion with lots of smooth transitions from one color to the next. To save an 
image as a JPEG, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save for Web & Devices and then click the 2-Up tab to 
view the original image (left) at the same time as the optimized image 
(right).

Saving for the Web and Devices
488
 
2. Choose one of the JPEG preset settings from the Settings drop-down list.
 
 You can choose Low, Medium, High, or customize a level in between the 
presets by using the Quality slider.
 
3. Leave the Optimized check box selected to build the best JPEG at the 
smallest size.
 
 The only issue with leaving this check box selected is that some very old 
browsers won’t read the JPEG correctly. (This is probably not an issue 
for most of your viewers.)
 
4. Leave the Embed Color Profile check box deselected unless you’re in 
a color-managed workflow and color accuracy is essential.
 
 Leaving this check box deselected dramatically increases the file size, 
and most people aren’t looking for exact color matches from an image 
on the monitor.
 
5. If you have to have the file size even smaller, use the Blur slider to 
bring down some detail.
 
 It’s funny, but one JPEG that’s the exact same pixel dimensions as 
another may vary in file size because the more detailed an image, the 
more information is needed. So an image of lots of apples will be larger 
than an image the same size that has a lot of clear blue sky in it. The blur 
feature does blur the image (surprise!), so you may want to use this for 
only a Low Source image in Dreamweaver.
 
6. (Optional) Choose a matte color from the Matte drop-down list.
 
 Because JPEG doesn’t support transparency, you can flood the transpar-
ent area with a color that you choose from the Matte drop-down list. 
Choose the color that you’re using for the background of your Web page 
by choosing Other and entering the hexadecimal color in the lower por-
tion of the Color Picker.
 
7. Click Save.
PNG
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is almost the perfect combination of JPEG 
and GIF. Unfortunately, PNG isn’t yet widely supported . . . note, as well, that 
PNG-24 images have file sizes that can be too large to use on the Web.
PNG supports varying levels of transparency and anti-aliasing. This variation 
means that you can specify an image as being 50-percent transparent, and it 
will actually show through to the underlying Web page! You have a choice of 
PNG-8 and PNG-24 in the Save for Web & Devices dialog box. As a file format 
for optimizing images, PNG-8 doesn’t give you any advantage over a regular 
GIF file.

Chapter 10

PNG files are not supported by all browsers. In older browsers, a plug-in may 
be required to view your page. Ouch . . . by choosing PNG, you could shoot 
yourself in the foot because not all your viewers can view the PNG.
If you’re saving a PNG file, you have a choice of PNG-8 or PNG-24. The PNG-8 
options are essentially the same as the GIF options; see the “Saving a GIF” 
section, earlier in this chapter, for details.
PNG-24 saves 24-bit images that support anti-aliasing (the smooth transi-
tion from one color to another). They work beautifully for continuous-tone 
images but are much larger than a JPEG file. The truly awesome feature of a 
PNG file is that it supports 256 levels of transparency. In other words, you 
can apply varying amounts of transparency in an image, as shown in Figure 
10-3, where the image shows through to the background.

parency.
 
WBMP
WBMP (Wireless BitMap) is a format optimized for mobile computing, has 
no compression, is one-bit color (just black and white, no shades!), and is 
one-bit deep. WBMP images aren’t necessarily pretty, but they’re functional 
(see Figure 10-4). You do have dithering controls to show some level of tone 
value.
If you’re creating images for mobile devices, know that WBMP is part of 
the Wireless Application Protocol, Wireless Application Environment 
Specification Version 1.1.
 
Click the Preview in Default Browser button at the bottom of the Save for Web & 
Devices dialog box to launch your chosen Web browser and display the image 
as it will appear with the present settings. If you haven’t set up a browser, click 
the down arrow and choose Other from the drop-down list. Browse to locate a 
browser that you want to preview your image in.

Want to see how your mobile content will look on specific devices? Click 
the Device Central button in the lower right of the Save for Web & Devices 
dialog box.
Matte
Matting appears as a choice in the JPEG, GIF, and PNG format options. Matting 
is useful if you don’t want ragged edges appearing around your image. 
Matting looks for pixels that are greater than 50-percent transparent and 
makes them fully transparent; any pixels that are 50 percent or less 
transparent become fully opaque.
Even though your image might be on a transparent layer, there will be some 
iffy pixels, the ones that aren’t sure what they want to be . . . to be trans-
parent or not to be transparent. Choose a matte color to blend in with the 
transparent iffy pixels by selecting Eyedropper, White, Black, or Other (to 
open the Color Picker) from the Matte drop-down list in the Save for Web & 
Devices dialog box.

Acrobat Information
In This Chapter
✓ Discovering Acrobat and PDF files
✓ Understanding when to use PDF files
✓ Becoming familiar with the Acrobat workspace and tools
A
dobe Acrobat 9 provides a variety of tools for sharing and reviewing 
documents. Adobe Creative Suite applications can create Portable 
Document Format (PDF) files, and you can also use Acrobat to create PDF 
files from programs that aren’t part of the Creative Suite. After you create 
a PDF file, you can use Acrobat to enhance the files by adding interactiv-
ity, merging PDF documents together, adding comments or annotations, or 
applying security that restricts features, such as printing or editing.
In this chapter, you find out why you may want to create PDF files and 
acquaint yourself with the Adobe Acrobat tools and workspace. You see 
how easy it is to navigate through PDF files with the navigational tools, tabs, 
and viewing options in Acrobat. In the following chapters of this minibook, 
you explore how to use Acrobat to create PDF files from documents pro-
duced in a variety of programs and discover ways to enhance your PDF files 
with Acrobat.
Working with PDF Files
Adobe Acrobat is used to create, review, and modify PDF files. You can use 
PDF as a way to share documents created with the Adobe Creative Suite. 
Because PDF is a common file format, you can use it to share Creative Suite 
files for review, approval, or final publication. When you use a program in 
the Creative Suite, such as Illustrator or InDesign, to create a document, 
others would need the same software to open or edit the files. By converting 
your documents to PDF, they can easily be shared with others who might 
not have the same software as you because PDF files can be viewed by users 
on virtually all types of computers and operating systems.
PDF provides a common file format for viewing files, regardless of what 
software program was used to create them. Additionally, Acrobat provides 
extensive tools for reviewing, commenting, and marking files so that you 

Working with PDF Files
496
can easily collaborate on a project without modifying the original document, 
along with tools to make PDF files interactive, merge related documents 
together, and secure files to restrict viewing or editing.
Because the software to view PDF files is free, you can be assured that those 
receiving your files don’t need to purchase any special software. In fact, the 
odds are quite good that most users already have some type of free PDF 
viewing software, such as Adobe Reader.
PDF has become a popular way to share files because it provides a true 
reproduction of an original document. PDF is used by the Internal Revenue 
Service to distribute tax forms online. Many financial services firms and 
insurance companies use PDF because the electronic documents can be 
secured, and they accurately represent documents that have been approved 
for distribution. Graphic artists even use PDF files to send books, like the 
one you’re reading now, to the printing plant.
Although PDF files provide a high-quality representation of an original file, 
they’re more than just a picture of a document. PDF files retain the high-
quality appearance of text while keeping the text searchable. Logos and 
illustrations created with Adobe Illustrator retain a high-quality appearance 
when converted to PDF, and intricate details from bitmap images, such as 
those edited with Adobe Photoshop, can also be maintained. PDF files allow 
you to distribute a high-fidelity electronic document. When creating a PDF 
file, you can choose settings that make the file suitable for high-quality print-
ing or make the file smaller and more suitable for posting to a Web site or 
sharing as an e-mail attachment.
Although Acrobat is part of the Creative Suite, it’s not a design tool — rather, 
it’s a tool for distributing documents created in other software programs 
and enhancing these documents for online distribution. You generally don’t 
use Acrobat to build new documents. Acrobat is a medium for sharing files, 
not for creating them. With Acrobat, you can
 
✦ Share documents with users who don’t have the same software or 
fonts that you use.
 
✦ Review and mark PDF files that others send you. With Adobe Acrobat, 
you can enable a PDF file to be reviewed by users with the free Adobe 
Reader software.
 
✦ Combine documents created in other programs. You can use Acrobat 
to merge PDF files together into one document, even files that may have 
been originally created in different programs.
 
✦ Create a PDF portfolio. You can combine various file formats into a 
single PDF package and yet retain the files in their original file formats.

✦ Edit Adobe PDF files to make minor changes to text or graphics.
 
✦ Apply security to PDF files when you don’t want them changed or you 
want to restrict viewing to certain individuals.
 
✦ Add interactivity to PDF files by enhancing them with sounds, movies, 
animations, and buttons.
 
✦ Create interactive forms to collect information electronically, avoid-
ing the need for manual data collection.
We cover these capabilities throughout the rest of this minibook.
Knowing When to Use Adobe PDF Files
So when does it make sense to use Adobe PDF files? Here are some examples:
 
✦ When you want to review a document quickly and efficiently: When 
documents need to be reviewed or approved, Acrobat really shines. The 
reviewers don’t need to have the Creative Suite software — or whatever 
you used to create the document. They only need a program to view 
PDF files, such as the free Adobe Reader or the Apple Preview applica-
tion. Recipients can then use commenting, markup, and annotation tools 
to add suggestions and edits to a file. You can even combine comments 
from multiple reviewers into a single document and manage the review 
process online or via e-mail.
 
✦ When you’ve created a document that you don’t want others to edit: 
Your recipients may have the same software you used to build the docu-
ment, but you can keep them from editing the original file by distributing 
it as a PDF file. Whether you want to secure a spreadsheet from editing 
or an InDesign document from modification, Acrobat includes security 
options that allow you to protect your original content.
 
✦ When you’ve created a presentation that includes files from different 
programs: By converting the documents to PDF, you can combine them 
into a single file. For example, you can merge PowerPoint, Excel, and 
InDesign files into a single PDF document. Whether you need to protect 
your brand and identity by keeping documents from being edited or 
simply want to ease the process of sharing files, PDF makes it easy to 
share your ideas.
 
✦ When you have a sensitive document: If you have a document con-
taining information that you don’t want unauthorized persons viewing 
or you don’t want printed, you can enhance the file with security with 
the Adobe Acrobat security tools. With the security options, you can 
require users to enter a password to view the file, or you can limit other 
features, such as the ability to print or edit the document.

Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
498
Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
To take advantage of all that Acrobat has to offer, you’ll want to discover the 
workspace and tools so you can get around within a PDF file. Acrobat opens 
with a blank workspace, and most tools and capabilities aren’t available until 
you open a document. You can open a document by clicking the folder icon 
in the upper-left corner of the Document window or choosing File➪Open.
When you open a document, you see the Acrobat workspace, which is 
divided into three areas. The largest portion of the workspace is the 
Document window, which displays the document you have opened. Across 
the top, the tools are stored in the toolbar well. Along the left side of the 
window, you find the navigation panels that help you find your way through 
the document. When you open a PDF document with Acrobat, you can use 
the toolbars and buttons in the toolbar well to navigate a file and you can 
use the navigation panel to move through a PDF file. For example, a PDF file 
may contain multiple pages. You can use the navigational buttons or the 
Pages panel to move between pages and then use a tool to manipulate the 
file, such as the commenting tools.
In the toolbar, you find useful information for navigating through your docu-
ment, including
 
✦ Current page and total pages: To move to a specific page, click in the 
area showing the current page, type a different page number, and press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac).
 
✦ Previous Page and Next Page buttons: Use these navigational buttons 
to skip forward or backward one page at a time.
Changing page magnification
Sometimes you want to see the entire page of a document; other times, you 
may only need to read the text or examine a small portion of a page. Acrobat 
provides several preset viewing options to help you with this, and you can 
also customize the magnification to zoom in on the page.
If things are a bit too small for you to see clearly, increase the magnification 
used for viewing pages with the Zoom drop-down list in the toolbar. Preset 
magnification choices are available in this drop-down list. You can also use 
the minus (–) and plus (+) symbols to the left of the current magnification 
level to zoom out or in.
The Marquee Zoom tool is the magnifying glass icon located to the left 
of the minus and plus symbols. You can use the Marquee Zoom tool to 
identify specific portions of a page that you want to magnify. Select this 
tool and then click and drag around a portion of the page to increase the

Information
Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
499
magnification. You can also click multiple times on an area with this tool 
to increase the page magnification, but clicking and dragging a box with 
the Marquee Zoom tool is generally a much faster way to focus on a por-
tion of a page you want to view. You can change the Marquee Zoom from 
its default attribute of increasing the magnification to decreasing the zoom 
by selecting the Marquee Zoom tool and Ctrl-clicking (Windows) or Option-
clicking (Mac) in the Document window. The magnifier’s plus (+) sign 
changes to a minus sign (–) to indicate that you’re decreasing the docu-
ment’s magnification. It’s usually faster to choose a preset zoom percent-
age though.
To the right of the magnification percentage box are page buttons that you 
can use to change the page magnification:
 
✦ Scrolling Pages: Use this button to avoid scrolling from left to right 
when reading a document. The view is changed to fit the document’s 
width in the available space on your display, making it necessary to only 
scroll up and down on a page. This also sets the page view to display the 
top or bottom of adjacent pages. When you scroll and reach the bottom 
of one page, the top of the next page becomes visible.
 
✦ One Full Page: Use this button to fit the current page within the avail-
able screen space on your monitor. For smaller documents, such as a 
business card, the magnification is increased. For larger documents, the 
magnification is generally decreased unless you have a large monitor. 
When viewing pages in the Fit Page mode, only one page is displayed at 
a time. This mode is good for viewing the entire display of a page layout.
Toolbars
The toolbars in Acrobat 9 are customizable, so you can display different 
toolbars or change the location of existing toolbars to meet your needs.
Customizing the location of toolbars on your screen can make it easier for 
you to work with PDF files in Acrobat. For example, you may want all the 
tools for navigating through your documents in one section of the toolbar 
well. To achieve this, you can rearrange the location of specific toolbars.
Along the left edge of every group of tools is a dotted double line. By clicking 
and holding onto this edge with your mouse, you can drag any toolbar to a 
new location on your screen. This new location can be within the same area 
holding the other toolbars, or anywhere in the Acrobat work area. If you 
pull a toolbar out of the docking area, the toolbar becomes independent and 
floating. You can reposition or drag floating toolbars back into the docking 
area when you’re finished working with them. You can also close a floating 
toolbar by clicking its Close Window button. You can place toolbars along 
the left or right side of the Acrobat work area — turning either side of the 
Acrobat workspace into a docking area for toolbars.

Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools

Although the flexibility of placing toolbars anywhere you like is useful, it 
may lead to a chaotic work environment. Instead of leaving toolbars all over 
your screen, you can have Acrobat clean up the workspace by choosing 
View➪Toolbars➪Reset Toolbars.
Toolbars contain both tools and buttons. For example, you choose the 
Marquee Zoom tool to change the magnification by clicking or selecting 
an area of the page. Buttons perform an immediate task, such as printing, 
saving, or applying security to a PDF document. In general, most of the task 
buttons are on the top row of the docking area, immediately below the menu 
bar, and most of the tools are on the bottom row — but you can move these 
toolbars.
 
Some tools and task buttons also include additional options that you can 
access through drop-down lists within the toolbars. Tools and buttons that 
contain additional choices are noted by the small triangle immediately to the 
right of the icon. Click this small triangle, and you see a drop-down list pro-
viding the additional choices for that tool or button.
Less than half the toolbars are visible in the default Acrobat display. You 
can add to the tools that are displayed or limit them by clicking the check 
box next to those you want to display or hide in the More Tools dialog box. 
Toolbars that have a check mark next to their names are visible, whereas 
those without a check mark aren’t visible.
To display additional tools, choose View➪Toolbars➪More Tools. In the 
More Tools dialog box that appears, select the tools you want displayed in 
the toolbar and then click OK. The Selecting and Zoom Toolbar section dis-
plays the navigation tool choices that can be displayed.
 
You can choose to show or hide additional toolbars by right-clicking 
(Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac) in the toolbar well. After right-clicking/
Control-clicking, choose the toolbar you want to show or hide from the con-
textual menu that appears.
Viewing modes
Acrobat provides several viewing modes that control how the document’s 
displayed. For example, you can choose to display the pages of a book or 
a magazine side-by-side, or view only one page at a time. You can choose 
which viewing mode is used by choosing View➪Page Display and selecting 
the viewing option you want.
The viewing modes are

Book V
Chapter 1
Discovering 
Essential Acrobat 
Information
Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
501
 
✦ Single Page: This mode displays only the current document page on-
screen and doesn’t show any adjoining pages. When you scroll to the 
top or bottom of the current page, other pages aren’t visible at the same 
time as the current page.
 
✦ Single Page Continuous: With this mode, you can see the current docu-
ment page, and if you scroll to the top (or bottom) of the current page, 
the adjoining page is also visible. If you reduce your page viewing magni-
fication, many document pages are visible.
 
✦ Two-Up (previously known as Facing): Use this mode to see pages as 
a spread, where you can view both the left and right sides of adjoining 
pages at the same time. When you have documents with pictures or text 
that spans a pair of pages, use this option to see the pages presented 
side-by-side in Acrobat. As with the Single Page mode, other pages that 
go before or fall after the spread aren’t visible — only the one pair of 
pages is visible on-screen, regardless of the magnification or scrolling.
 
✦ Two-Up Continuous (previously known as Continuous-Facing): If you 
have a document with many pages containing text or pictures on their 
adjoining pages, you can use this mode to scroll from one pair of visible 
pages to the next. When the Two-Up Continuous view is selected, you 
can see adjoining page spreads. This option is identical to the Two-Up 
option, but it also shows pages above or below the spread you’re pres-
ently viewing.
If you have pages where images or text goes across pages, the Two-Up 
choice is useful. By default, the pages generally display incorrectly. For 
example, a magazine will display the cover (page 1) and page 2 together, 
instead of pages 2 and 3. To correct this, choose View➪Page Display➪Show 
Cover Page during Two-Up. Additionally, the default option is for Acrobat 
to display a space between pages that are displayed together in the Two-Up 
mode. You can replace the space with a dotted line to divide the adjoining 
pages by choosing View➪Page Display➪Show Gaps between Pages.
 
You can add viewing modes as menu buttons by choosing 
View➪Toolbars➪More Tools, as described earlier in the “Toolbars” section 
of this chapter.
Additional viewing options
Acrobat has two additional options for changing your document display:
 
✦ Full Screen mode (View➪Full Screen Mode): You can use the Full 
Screen mode option to hide all menus, toolbars, and other parts of the 
Acrobat interface. This option is useful if you want to focus on the docu-
ment being displayed, not the program being used to view it. Use this 

Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
502
mode, for example, when you’ve a converted PowerPoint file to a PDF 
document and want to deliver the presentation with Acrobat. If you’re 
viewing a document in the Full Screen mode, press the Esc key to return 
to the regular viewing mode.
 
 When using the Full Screen mode, you can select Edit➪Preferences and 
choose Full Screen to define attributes that change the way the file dis-
plays. You can set the display to advance automatically from one page 
to the next at a certain interval, choose from many different page transi-
tion types, and define the background color.
 
 You can set a document to automatically open in Full Screen mode by 
choosing File➪Properties and choosing this option from the Initial View 
panel of the Document Properties dialog box.
 
✦ Reading mode (View➪Reading Mode): The many toolbars and buttons 
of Acrobat can get in the way of the document you wish to review. Use 
Reading mode to temporarily hide all the toolbars and buttons, making 
it easier to focus on the content of the PDF file.
Navigation panels
Acrobat offers a variety of panels that are helpful when navigating through 
PDF documents. The navigation panels are displayed along the left side of 
your Document window as small icons. Click an icon to make its panel vis-
ible. For example, click the Pages icon to display thumbnail-size representa-
tions of each page, as shown in Figure 1-1.
 
Figure 1-1:

icons to the 
left to see

In the Pages panel, click a thumbnail page to display that page in the 
Document window. You can also choose View➪Navigation Panels to access 
these same panels. There are 12 panels: Articles, Attachments, Bookmarks, 
Comments, Content, Destinations, Layers, Model Tree, Order, Pages, 
Signatures, and Tags.
Many panels have more advanced uses that are covered in later chapters 
of this minibook. In this chapter, we provide you with a brief understanding 
of how you can use the Pages panel to more easily navigate through a PDF 
document. Follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the Pages panel is visible by clicking its panel icon.
 
2. In the Pages panel, click any page thumbnail to navigate directly to 
that page.
 
 A dark border appears around the selected page and a red box in the 
Pages panel indicates what portion of the page is being viewed.
 
 You can click in the corner of the small red box and drag diagonally 
upward to increase the magnification on the section of the page con-
tained within the box. Alternatively, make the box larger by clicking and 
dragging down and out to expand the size of the viewing area. Changing 
the size of the red box displayed on the page in the Pages panel changes 
the focus of the magnification.

Chapter 2: Creating PDF Files
In This Chapter
✓ Creating PDF files from Microsoft Office documents
✓ Creating PDF files from Creative Suite applications
✓ Creating PDF files from all other electronic formats
✓ Creating PDF files from the Web and paper documents
C
onverting documents to the Portable Document Format (PDF) is a great 
way to share files when readers don’t have the same software as you or 
when you want to consolidate multiple file types together into a single docu-
ment. Adobe Acrobat lets you create files from all software programs and 
scanned documents and even pages from the Web. Although you can also 
create PDF files from Adobe Creative Suite 4 (CS4) documents, you don’t 
need Acrobat for this because the ability to create PDF files is built into 
the individual Creative Suite programs, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and 
InDesign. In this chapter, you find out how to create Adobe PDF files from a 
variety of programs.
Creating PDF Files from Microsoft Office
Adobe Acrobat includes tools that make it easy to convert Microsoft Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint files to PDF.
 
These capabilities are much more robust for the Windows versions of these 
programs, so Macintosh users may discover that not all these options are 
available.
When you install Acrobat on your computer, it looks for Microsoft Office 
programs. If Acrobat locates Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Outlook, it 
installs an add-in — the PDF Maker — to these programs that helps convert 
Microsoft Office documents to PDF in a single click.
You can tell whether the PDF Maker add-in has been installed in your 
Microsoft Office programs by looking for the Acrobat toolbar or the Acrobat 
tab, depending upon which version of Microsoft Office you use. In Office 
2007, the Acrobat tab appears to the right of the View tab. In earlier ver-
sions of Microsoft Office, the toolbar appears at the top of the Document 

Creating PDF Files from Microsoft Office
506
window. If the toolbar isn’t visible, choose View➪Toolbars to see whether 
the Acrobat toolbar is available in the Toolbars submenu. If it remains 
unavailable, you may need to reinstall Adobe Acrobat to gain access to the 
PDF Maker tools.
 
When you convert documents to PDF, the original file remains unchanged, 
so you have both the original file and a separate PDF document. The original 
document and the PDF file aren’t linked, so changes to the original source 
file aren’t reflected in the PDF file. When you edit the PDF document, the 
changes don’t update in the original file.
PDF conversion options
PDF Maker provides a variety of controls over how PDF files are created 
from Microsoft Office programs, such as Word and Excel. For example, you 
can have Acrobat create the file without asking you to confirm the location 
and name of the file each time you click the Create PDF button, and Acrobat 
will simply save the file in the same location as the original document. 
Similarly, you can choose to create PDF files that balance your need for qual-
ity and file size.
PDF Maker also provides controls over the type of PDF file you create 
because some PDF files may need to be of a higher quality for printing and 
others may need to be smaller to allow for fast electronic distribution. For 
example, you may want to post a PDF document to a Web site, where you 
want to make the file small so that it can be downloaded quickly.
When working in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, you can access 
the PDF Maker controls by clicking the Acrobat tab and then clicking the 
Preferences button (Office 2007) or by choosing Adobe PDF➪Change 
Conversion Settings (earlier versions of Microsoft Office). In the Acrobat PDF 
Maker dialog box that appears, you can then choose from a variety of set-
tings that control how the PDF file is created. In this section, we focus on the 
most useful options for Microsoft Office users.
From the Conversion Settings drop-down list in the Acrobat PDF Maker dialog 
box, you can find these useful options that control how the PDF file is generated:
 
✦ Standard: Choose this option to create PDF files that will be printed on 
an office laser printer or distributed via e-mail. This setting meets the 
needs of most users — it provides some compression of graphics, but 
they remain clear on-screen and look reasonably good when printed. In 
addition, this setting builds the fonts into the PDF file to maintain an exact 
representation of the document, regardless of where the file is viewed.
 
✦ Smallest File Size: With this setting, you can control the file size of the 
PDF documents you create. This setting provides significant compres-
sion of images and also reduces resolution, which causes graphics 
within the files to lose some clarity and perhaps appear jagged.

Book V
Chapter 2
Creating PDF Files
Creating PDF Files from Microsoft Office
507
 
 In addition, fonts aren’t embedded in PDF files created with this setting. 
If the fonts used in the document aren’t available on a computer where a 
PDF created with the Smallest File Size setting is viewed, Acrobat uses a 
font substitution technology to replicate the size and shape of the fonts 
used in the document. This feature typically provides a similar appear-
ance to the original document, but it’s not always an exact match of the 
original file.
 
 Because this setting is so lossy, use it only if you need to compress a 
large file to a small enough size to send as an e-mail attachment. Make 
certain the recipient has the fonts used in the document installed on his 
or her computer. Otherwise, Adobe uses font substitution.
 
✦ Press Quality: If you need to provide PDF files to your commercial 
printer or copy shop, use this setting to create a PDF file that’s designed 
for high-quality print reproduction. Along with including fonts in the PDF 
file, the graphics aren’t significantly compressed, and they maintain a 
much higher resolution. Overall, these files tend to be larger than similar 
PDF files created with different settings, but the quality of the PDF file 
is more important than the file size when you’re having the PDF profes-
sionally printed.
Several other highly technical options might be useful for you if you have 
a specialized profession. For example, if you archive items with PDF, the 
PDF/A options are designed for this. Additionally, the PDF/X options are 
useful for those submitting advertisements to publications that require the 
PDF advertisements adhere to the PDF/X standard.
PDF conversion options from 
Microsoft Word and Excel
Although Microsoft Word and Excel are widespread standards on many cor-
porate computers, they aren’t always the best choice for distributing docu-
ments. Formatting of Microsoft Word documents and Excel spreadsheets 
changes depending on the fonts available on users’ computer or even the 
printer with which they print, whereas PDF files can keep the file looking 
consistent on various computer types. In addition, Microsoft Word and Excel 
files can be easily edited, and users can also copy and extract information 
from these files with few limitations, whereas PDF files are more difficult to 
copy from, and they can be secured with robust security options.
Converting a Word or Excel file to a PDF file overcomes these limitations and 
is quite straightforward. Choose from two methods:
 
✦ From inside Microsoft Word or Excel, make sure that the document 
you want to convert to a PDF file is open and then click the Create PDF 
button in the main toolbar to convert the document.
 
✦ With Office 2003 or earlier, choose Adobe PDF➪Convert to Adobe PDF.

Creating PDF Files from Microsoft Office
508
No matter which method you choose, you must specify the location of the 
PDF file that’s created and name the file unless you have changed the PDF 
Maker preferences.
 
In Office 2007, click the Preferences button in the Acrobat tab, or with ear-
lier versions of Office, choose Acrobat➪Change Conversion Settings. In the 
Adobe PDF Maker dialog box, deselect the Prompt for PDF Filename option so 
that PDF files are generated in one step, without inputting the PDF filename.
You can add functionality into the PDF documents you create. Click the 
Preference tab if you’re working in Office 2007 or choose Acrobat➪Change 
Conversion Settings in earlier versions of Office. In the dialog box that 
appears, review the following settings:
 
✦ Attach Source File: Causes the original Office document to become 
embedded within the PDF file as an attachment. When the PDF file is dis-
tributed, the original source file is included within the PDF file.
 
✦ Create Bookmarks: Adds interactive bookmarks that make navigating 
the PDF file easy. Bookmarks are added based on Microsoft Word styles, 
such as text that’s styled as Heading 1. The bookmarks appear in the 
Bookmarks panel when viewing the PDF.
 
✦ Add Links: Automatically converts Word links, such as Web addresses, 
into PDF links that you can use when viewing the file in Acrobat or 
Adobe Reader. Within the PDF Maker preferences dialog box, click the 
Word tab to access additional link options that can be built into PDF 
files created from Word.
Converting PowerPoint files to PDF
You can convert your PowerPoint presentations to Adobe PDF documents 
with the PDF Maker add-in that installs with Adobe Acrobat. PDF versions of 
PowerPoint presentations can be distributed to avoid concerns about the file 
being edited or concerns that the recipient may not have the same fonts that 
you used, causing the presentation to look different on various computers.
From PowerPoint, click the Create PDF button to save the file as a PDF 
file. Of course, make sure that the presentation you’re converting is open 
before you click the button. In older versions of Office, you can also choose 
Acrobat➪Convert to Adobe PDF from PowerPoint’s main menu. If you’re work-
ing with a new file, you must save it before PDF Maker will convert the file.
As with Word and Excel, you can select options relating to the conversion 
of your PowerPoint documents to PDF. To access the preferences, click the 
Preference button in the Acrobat tab or in older versions of Office, choose 
Acrobat➪Change Conversion Settings. Along with the conversion settings 
that impact the quality of the resulting PDF file, select two additional options:

Book V
Chapter 2
Creating PDF Files
Creating PDF Files from Adobe Creative Suite Applications
509
 
✦ Preserve Slide Transitions: With this option, you can have the slide 
transitions that were created in PowerPoint converted into PDF transi-
tions that will be used when the presentation is delivered using Adobe 
Acrobat’s Full Screen mode option.
 
✦ Convert Multimedia: Because Adobe PDF files can contain integrated 
sound and movie files, you can choose this option to have sounds and 
movies used in a PowerPoint file converted into the PDF document.
 
After you create the PDF, you can use Acrobat as the tool for delivering your 
presentations that have been created using PowerPoint. After you convert 
the file to PDF, open it in Acrobat and choose View➪Full Screen Mode. You 
can even distribute the document to users with the free Adobe Reader, 
and they can use the free Adobe Reader software to view and display the 
PowerPoint presentation file. Press the Esc key to stop viewing a document 
in the Full Screen mode. To distribute a document so that it always opens in 
Full Screen mode, open the document, choose File➪Document Properties, 
and select the Open in Full Screen Mode check box.
Creating PDF Files from Adobe Creative 
Suite Applications
You can also convert Photoshop files, Illustrator files, or InDesign docu-
ments to the PDF format. In this section, we show you how.
Converting Photoshop and Illustrator files to PDF
Both Adobe Photoshop CS4 and Adobe Illustrator CS4 can save documents 
directly in the Adobe PDF file format. To do so, simply choose File➪Save or 
File➪Save As. Then, from the File Type drop-down list, choose Adobe PDF 
(Illustrator) or Photoshop PDF (Photoshop). In these programs, you can 
create PDF files without Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Distiller because they’ve 
integrated PDF creation capabilities.
You can use Adobe Reader or Acrobat to view PDF files created from 
Photoshop or Illustrator. You can also open and edit PDF files using the 
same program in which they were created. 
Converting InDesign documents to PDF
Like Photoshop and Illustrator, the ability to convert InDesign documents 
to PDF is integrated into the application. With Adobe InDesign, you can 
choose File➪Export and select Adobe PDF from the File Type drop-down 
list. InDesign provides a significant number of options for controlling the 
size and quality of the resulting PDF file. Many of these options are similar to 
those available for PDF Maker for Microsoft Office.

Creating PDF Files from Adobe Creative Suite Applications
510
In the Adobe InDesign Export PDF dialog box, you can choose from the 
Preset drop-down list at the top of the dialog box. The choices are many, but 
we list and describe here the most commonly used settings:
 
✦ Smallest File Size: Creates compact Adobe PDF files that are intended 
for display on the Internet or to be distributed via e-mail. Use this set-
ting to create PDF files that will be viewed primarily on-screen.
 
✦ High Quality Print: Creates Adobe PDF files that are intended for desk-
top printers and digital copiers.
 
✦ Press Quality: Use this setting to create PDF files that will be delivered 
to a commercial printer for high-quality, offset print reproduction.
 
When creating PDF files to be used for high-resolution printing, here are 
some settings you should use. Select Marks and Bleeds in the list on the left 
of the Export PDF dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-1, and specify the amount 
of space items need to extend off the page, referred to a bleed. If you’re deliv-
ering the file to a printing firm, they can provide you with guidance as to the 
required value. A good rule to follow is to use at least .125 inches if you have 
any items in your layout that extend to the edge of your document pages 
and beyond. Specify the value you want by entering the number in the Bleed 
and Slug section of the Marks and Bleeds tab. If the amount of bleed needs 
to be the same on all four sides, type the value in the Top text box and then 
click the link icon to the right of the Top and Bottom Bleed text boxes.

Converting Other Electronic Documents to PDF
As described earlier in this chapter, creating PDF files from Creative Suite 
applications and Microsoft Office programs is simple. You can also create 
PDF files from many other programs. When you installed the Adobe Creative 
Suite on your computer, you also installed a new printer — the Adobe PDF 
printer — which is used to convert electronic documents to PDF files. The 
Adobe PDF printer captures all the same information that’s normally sent to 
your printer, and, instead of printing on paper, the information is converted 
into an Adobe PDF file.
To create a PDF file from any program, choose File➪Print. In the Print dialog 
box, select Adobe PDF as the printer and click OK (Windows) or Print (Mac).
To change the type of PDF file that’s created, such as a smaller file for 
Internet Web posting or a higher quality file for delivery to a commercial 
printer, do this:
 
✦ Windows: Click the Properties button in the Print dialog box to open 
the Adobe PDF Document Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-2. 
Here, you can choose the settings you want to use to control the quality 
and size of the resulting PDF file.
 
✦ Mac: Choose PDF Options from the Copies and Pages drop-down list in 
the Print dialog box and then select the PDF settings you want to use.

We discuss the PDF conversion settings earlier in this chapter, in the “PDF 
conversion options” section.

Creating PDF Files from Paper Documents and the Web
512
Using the Print menu to control the quality of PDF files created from non-
Adobe programs may appear strange, but it’s the easiest way for Adobe to 
capture all the same information that you’d expect to see when you print 
your files. This provides an easy and standard method for generating PDF 
files from any program. In fact, you can even use this method for creating 
PDF files from Adobe Creative Suite programs. It’s useful to have this avail-
able as an option if you’re having difficulty with the Export command. The 
Print and Export commands use different processes for creating PDF files, 
so you can use one option if you have difficulty with the other when creating 
PDF files from Creative Suite programs.
 
Bookmarks, links, page transitions, and multimedia aren’t exported if a PDF 
is generated with the Print menu option. You must use the Export option to 
have these items included in PDF files.
Creating PDF Files from Paper 
Documents and the Web
PDF files don’t need to start as electronic publishing files. Adobe Acrobat 
provides options for converting both paper documents and Internet Web 
pages into PDF format.
Converting paper documents to PDF
To convert paper documents into PDF, you need a scanner to digitize the 
information. If you expect to scan a large number of pages into PDF, con-
sider purchasing a scanner with an automatic document feeder. Some scan-
ners can scan both the front and backside of a document at the same time. 
Scanners, such as the Fujitsu ScanSnap, now fit easily on your desktop and 
let you convert a large number of paper documents to PDF in a short period 
of time. Some scanners, such as the ScanSnap, automatically launch Acrobat 
and convert scanned documents to PDF; others require you to scan the file. 
If a scanner is already hooked to the computer on which you use Acrobat 
and doesn’t automatically start Acrobat, follow these steps to scan in a 
paper document and then convert it to PDF format:
 
1. From the Acrobat main menu, choose File➪Create PDF➪From 
Scanner.
 
 Then choose the type of PDF document you wish to create. For pages 
with text, choose one of the Document options: Black and White for line 
art or text that contains no shades of gray; Grayscale for documents 
that contain varying shades of gray; or Color for documents that contain 
color. For photographs, choose the Image option.
 
2. Make sure that your scanner is turned on, put the document to be 
scanned into the scanner, and then click the Scan button.

Book V
Chapter 2
Creating PDF Files
Creating PDF Files from Paper Documents and the Web
513
 
 If necessary, continue to scan multiple pages into a single document. 
When you’re done scanning, the scanned page appears in Acrobat.
 
 If you have a PDF open and choose Create PDF from Scanner, a window 
appears, giving you the opportunity to append the file (add to the exist-
ing file) or create a new PDF file.
 
 The scanned document opens in Acrobat.
 
 If the pages need to be rotated, choose Document➪Rotate Pages.
 
3. Choose File➪Save to save the finished document as a PDF.
Scanned text is fully searchable if you use one of the Document preset 
choices because Acrobat uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
to convert the image to text. If you open a previously scanned file, you 
can use Acrobat’s OCR capability by choosing Document➪OCR Text 
Recognition➪Recognize Text using OCR. This command makes previously 
scanned text searchable.
Converting Web pages to PDFs
By converting online content to Adobe PDF, you can capture contents from 
an Internet Web site. Because Web content can change rapidly, you can 
capture something that may not remain online for a long period of time. You 
can convert things, such as news stories or business information, from a 
Web site into PDF. Because PDF files can easily be combined together, you 
can merge a PDF from a Web site with other PDF files, such as spreadsheets, 
word-processing documents, and brochures.
If you want to convert only a single page and are using Internet Explorer, 
click the Convert Web Page to PDF button. This step converts the current 
Web page to a PDF. If you want to convert more than a single page, follow 
these steps from within Acrobat (not your Web browser):
 
1. From the Acrobat main menu, choose File➪Create PDF➪From Web 
Page.
 
 The Create PDF from Web Page dialog box opens.
 
2. In the URL text box, enter the URL for the Web site you’re converting 
to PDF.
 
3. To capture additional pages that are linked from the main page you’re 
capturing, click the Capture Multiple Levels button, and then select 
one of the following:
 
• Select the Stay On Same Path check box if you want only pages from 
the entered URL converted to PDF.
 
• Select the Stay On Same Server check box to download only pages 
that are on the same server as the entered URL.

 Be cautious about selecting the Get Entire Site radio button instead of 
the Get Only radio button. The Get Entire Site option may take an enor-
mous amount of time and not have any relevance to what you need.
 
4. Click the Settings button to open the Web Page Conversion Settings 
dialog box and see accepted file types and change PDF settings (on 
the General tab).
 
5. On the Page Layout tab of the Web Page Conversion Settings dialog 
box, make changes to page size, orientation, and margins if the Web 
page requires a wider or longer layout. See Figure 2-3.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Changing 
the layout of

6. When you’re done making changes in the Web Page Conversion 
Settings dialog box, click OK.
 
7. In the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box, click the Create button 
to generate a PDF.
 
 The Downloading Status window opens, showing the rate of download.
When the download is complete, the Web page (for the entered URL) 
selected appears as a PDF document, with hyperlinks (links to other pages 
within the site) intact. When links on the converted Web page are selected, 
you can open the linked page either in Acrobat or the Web browser.

Chapter 3: Adding Interactivity 
to PDF Files
In This Chapter
✓ Adding interactive bookmarks
✓ Creating and editing links
✓ Using buttons for easy navigation
B
ecause many Adobe PDF documents are viewed online, you need to 
make the documents easy for readers to navigate. With Acrobat, you 
can design documents that are easier to navigate than their printed counter-
parts and that include rich interactive features that simply aren’t available 
with paper documents.
Rather than making readers scroll through a document to find what they 
want, you can add links within an index or a table of contents, or you can 
add links to Web sites and e-mail addresses. Acrobat also includes features 
(known as bookmarks) to build your own online table of contents, and you 
can add buttons that link to specific pages within a PDF document or that 
cause an action to occur when clicked, such as closing the document. We 
discuss all these features in this chapter.
Adding Bookmarks to Ease PDF Navigation
One reason for distributing PDF documents is that it’s convenient and cost-
effective. But if users can’t easily find the information they need or they 
can’t effectively understand how the contents of a file are structured, they 
may become frustrated or they may need to print the document, which 
defeats the purpose of electronic distribution.
A table of contents in a traditional, printed book doesn’t work well with elec-
tronic PDF files. It requires you to constantly return to the page containing 
the table of contents and then navigate to the page containing the data you 
need. But you can make your documents more user-friendly by adding book-
marks, which are the equivalent of a table of contents that’s always avail-
able, no matter what page is being viewed in the Document window.
Bookmarks provide a listing of contents that reside within a PDF file or links 
to relevant external content. Bookmarks sit within a panel, and when you 
click one, you’re taken to a specific destination in the PDF document (or

possibly to an external file), much like a hyperlink. You can create book-
marks from existing text, or you can use your own text to describe the con-
tent, which is useful if the destination of the bookmark is a figure, chart, or a 
graphic.
By default, the Bookmarks icon resides along the left side of the Acrobat 
Document window in the navigation panel. Click the Bookmarks icon to make 
the panel appear; click the Bookmarks icon a second time to hide it. If the 
icon isn’t visible, choose View➪Navigation Panels➪Bookmarks to make it 
appear.
Creating bookmarks that link to a page
By navigating to a page, and to a specific view on a page, you can establish 
the destination of a bookmark link. With a PDF document open, follow these 
steps:
 
1. If the Bookmark icon isn’t visible, choose View➪Navigation 
Panels➪Bookmarks.
 
 The Bookmarks panel appears on the left of the Document window.
 
2. In the Document window, navigate to the page that you want as the 
bookmark’s destination.
 
3. Set the magnification of the view that you want by using the Marquee 
Zoom tool to either zoom in or zoom out.
 
 The zoom level that you’re at when you create the bookmark is the view 
that viewers see when they click the bookmark.
 
 4. In the Bookmarks panel, click the Options icon (it shows gears) and 
from the menu that appears, choose New Bookmark.
 
 The new bookmark appears in the Bookmarks panel as Untitled.
 
5. Change the name by typing something more descriptive.
 
 If you leave the bookmark as Untitled but want to rename it later, you 
must click the bookmark and then choose Options➪Rename Bookmark 
from the menu in the Bookmark panel.
 
6. Test your bookmark by scrolling to another page and viewing it in the 
Document window; then click your saved bookmark in the Bookmark 
panel.
 
 The Document window shows the exact location and zoom that you 
selected when you created the bookmark.
 
 If you use the Selection tool to highlight text, such as a headline or a caption, 
that’s part of the bookmark destination and then choose Options➪New 
Bookmark, the selected text becomes the title of the new bookmark. You can 
use this shortcut to avoid entering a new name for new bookmark titles. You 
can also press Ctrl+B (Windows) or Ô+B (Mac) to quickly create a bookmark.

Creating bookmarks that link to external files
Although bookmarks are most commonly used to link to content within a 
PDF file, you can also use bookmarks to create links to other documents. To 
create a link to an external file, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Options➪New Bookmark in the Bookmarks panel.
 
2. Replace the Untitled bookmark entry that appears in the Bookmarks 
panel with an appropriate title for the bookmark.
 
3. Choose Options➪Properties from the Bookmarks panel menu.
 
 The Bookmark Properties dialog box appears. With this dialog box, 
you can change a bookmark so that it links to any type of file. In this 
example, we use a PDF document, but the bookmark could be a link to 
another PDF file, a Photoshop file, or even a Microsoft Excel file. Just 
remember that this bookmark creates a relative link. The linked file must 
travel with the PDF document in order for the link to work.
 
4. In the Bookmark Properties dialog box, click the Actions tab, choose 
Open a File from the Select Action drop-down list, and then click the 
Add button.
 
 The Select File to Open dialog box appears.
 
 You can create links to Web sites as well. Choose Open a Web Link to 
access an Internet Web address.
 
5. Click the Browse button, choose a file to which the bookmark will 
navigate, and then click the Select button.
 
Note that the other file isn’t attached to the current document. If you distrib-
ute a PDF file containing the bookmarks to external files, you must distribute 
any external files that are referenced along with the source file; otherwise, 
the links won’t work. In addition, the linked files need to be in the same rela-
tive location as the original documents — so don’t change the name of the 
linked file or the folder in which it’s located.
Using bookmarks
Bookmarks are intuitive to use, which make them an attractive option to add 
to PDF files. After you click a bookmark, the action associated with it is per-
formed, which typically navigates you to a certain page within the PDF file.
Unfortunately, the Bookmarks panel doesn’t open automatically with a 
document, even when bookmarks are present within a file. To display the 
Bookmarks panel when a file is opened, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Properties.
 
2. In the Document Properties dialog box that opens, select the Initial 
View tab, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Adding Bookmarks to Ease PDF Navigation

Figure 3-1: 
The

in Adobe 
Acrobat.
 
 
3. From the Navigation drop-down list, choose Bookmarks Panel and 
Page and then click OK.
 
 After the file is saved and then reopened, the Bookmarks panel is dis-
played whenever the document is opened.
Editing bookmarks
You can change the attributes of bookmarks so that they link to 
other locations by clicking to select a bookmark and then choosing 
Options➪Properties in the Bookmarks panel. In the Bookmark Properties 
dialog box, choose the color and font type of the bookmark on the 
Appearance tab: To change the bookmark’s font style, choose a style from 
the Style drop-down list; to change the bookmark’s color, click the Color box 
and choose a color from the Color Picker.
On the Actions tab of the Bookmark Properties dialog box, you can delete 
existing actions (in the Actions section of the Actions tab) by clicking to 
select an action and then clicking the Delete button. Also, you can add 
actions by choosing another action from the Add Action section and then 
clicking the Add button. You can add more than one action to a bookmark.

Adding Interactive Links
519
Adding Interactive Links
When viewing a PDF file electronically, you can add links for e-mail 
addresses, Web addresses, and references to other pages. Links are 
attached to a region of a page, which you identify with the Link tool.
To add an interactive link to your PDF document, follow these steps:
 
1. Locate an area of a page where you want to add a link and then 
choose View➪Toolbars➪Advanced Editing to display the Advanced 
Editing toolbar.
 
 2. Select the Link tool and then click and drag to select the region that 
you want to link to.
 
 The Create Link dialog box appears.
 
3. Choose an action that the link will perform:
 
• Go to a Page View: This option is the default, where you can scroll to 
the page that is the destination of the link.
 
• Open a File: Alternatively, you can choose to link to another file; click 
the Browse button to locate the file.
 
• Open a Web Page: If you choose this option, you’re choosing to 
link to a Web address. In the Address text box, enter the complete 
address of the Web site to which the link should direct viewers. To 
create a link to an e-mail address, type mailto: followed by an e-mail 
address. (Note that mailto: is all one word with no spaces.)
 
• Custom Link: Use this option to choose from other types of links in 
the Link Properties dialog box.
 
4. Click Next and follow the instructions in the next dialog box before 
clicking OK.
 
The Link tool is relatively simple to use, but you may prefer to create links 
from text in another way: With the Selection tool, select the text, right-click 
(Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the selected text, and then choose Create 
Link from the contextual menu that appears.
 
You can have links transferred automatically from your original Microsoft 
Office documents when using PDF Maker.
You can edit links by choosing the Link tool and double-clicking the link to 
open the Link Properties dialog box. While editing a link, you can change 
how it’s presented in the Appearance tab. Make a link invisible or add a 
border to the link, such as a blue border that commonly is used to define 
hyperlinks. On the Actions tab of the Link Properties dialog box, you can 
add, edit, or delete actions, just as you can with bookmarks (see the preced-
ing section).

Adding Buttons to Simplify Your PDF Files

Adding Buttons to Simplify Your PDF Files
Along with links and bookmarks, buttons provide another way to make your 
files more useful when they’re viewed online. You can create interactive but-
tons entirely within Acrobat — designing their appearance and adding text 
to them. Or you can import buttons created in other Adobe Creative Suite 
applications, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. For example, you can create 
buttons that advance the viewer to the next page in a document.
 
Additional form editing tools are only available on the Windows platform.
 
 Buttons are added by entering the Form Editing mode. Choose Forms➪Add 
or Edit Fields to open the Forms Editor. You may have to click OK to have a 
scan for form fields performed.
To add a button to your PDF document, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Advanced Editing.
 
 The Advanced Editing toolbar appears.
 
2. Click the OK Button tool and drag where you want the button to 
appear in the document.
 
3. Type in an appropriate name for your button in the Field Name dialog 
box that appears.
 
4. Click the Show All Properties button to see the Button Properties 
dialog box.
 
5. In the General tab, you can enter a name for the button in the Name 
text box and provide a ToolTip in the ToolTip text box.
 
 A ToolTip is the text that appears whenever the mouse cursor is posi-
tioned over the button.
 
6. In the Appearance tab, establish how your button will look by setting 
the following options:
 
• Border Color/Fill Color: Click the square to the right of the appropri-
ate attribute in the Borders and Colors section of the Appearance tab 
and then choose a color from the Color Picker.
 
• Line Thickness and Style: These options don’t appear unless you 
change the border color from None (red diagonal line) to another 
selection.
 
• Font Size/Font: Change the size and font of the button text by making 
a selection from the Font Size and the Font drop-down lists.
 
• Text Color: Change the color of the text by clicking the color square 
and choosing a color from the Color Picker.

7. In the Options tab, make these selections:
 
• Layout: Use the Layout drop-down list to specify whether you want 
to use a label (text that you enter in Acrobat that appears on the 
face of the button) or whether you want an icon (an imported button 
graphic that you may have designed in Photoshop or Illustrator).
 
• Behavior: Choose Push from the Behavior drop-down list to create 
different appearances for a button so that it changes based upon 
whether the mouse cursor is positioned over the button. The button 
appearance can also change when clicked.
 
• State: To specify the different appearances (see Behavior, discussed 
in the preceding paragraph), click the State on the left side of the 
Options tab and then choose the Label or Icon status for each state.
 
• Label: If you choose to use a label, enter the text for it in the Label 
text field.
 
• Icon: If you choose to use an icon, specify the location of the graphic 
file by clicking the Choose Icon button. You can create button icons 
in either Photoshop or Illustrator.
 
8. In the Actions tab, choose an action from the Select Action drop-down 
list and then click the Add button.
 
 Actions are applied to buttons similar to the way in which they’re 
applied to links and bookmarks:
 
• To choose actions that are a part of the menu commands, such as 
printing a document, closing a file, or navigating to the next or pre-
ceding page, choose the Execute Menu Item action and then specify 
the command to be accessed.
 
• You can also choose the activity that causes the action to occur, 
known as the trigger. The default trigger is Mouse Up, which causes 
the action to occur when the mouse button is depressed and then 
released. You can choose other actions, such as the mouse cursor 
merely rolling over the button without the need to click it.
 
9. After you make all your changes in the Button Properties dialog box, 
click Close.

Chapter 4: Editing and Extracting 
Text and Graphics
In This Chapter
✓ Manipulating text with the TouchUp tools
✓ Modifying graphics with the TouchUp tools
✓ Pulling text and graphics out of PDFs for use in other documents
You may assume that PDF files are mere pictures of your documents 
and can’t be edited, but nothing is further from the truth. Adobe 
Acrobat includes a variety of tools for editing both text and graphics. You 
can use these tools as long as the file hasn’t been secured to prohibit edit-
ing. We introduce you to these great tools in this chapter. (We discuss 
security, which allows you to limit access to these tools, in Chapter 6 of 
this minibook.)
Editing Text
The tools for editing text and graphics are located on the Advanced Editing 
toolbar (see Figure 4-1).
 
Figure 4-1: 
The 
Advanced 
Editing 
toolbar.
 
 
You can add several TouchUp tools to the Advanced Editing toolbar by 
choosing View➪Toolbars➪More Tools and checking the tools you want 
to add.
For text tools, you have three choices:
 
✦ TouchUp Text tool: Used to manipulate text.
 
✦ TouchUp Object tool: Used to manipulate objects.

Editing Text
524
 
✦ TouchUp Reading Order tool: Used to correct the reading order or 
structure of the document.
The TouchUp Reading Order tool isn’t used for changing the appearance of 
the document, so we don’t discuss it in this chapter.
Using the TouchUp Text tool to manipulate text
The TouchUp Text tool is used for touching up, or manipulating, text. This 
touchup can include changing actual text characters or the appearance of 
text. You can change cat to read dog, or you can change black text to blue, or 
you can even change the Helvetica font to the Times font.
 
When you change a PDF file, the original source document isn’t modified.
You have a few ways to accomplish text edits:
 
✦ Choose the TouchUp Text tool, click within the text that you want to 
change to obtain an insertion point, and then start typing the new text.
 
✦ Click with the TouchUp tool in your text and press the Backspace or 
Delete key to delete text.
 
✦ With the TouchUp tool, drag to highlight text and enter new text to 
replace the highlighted text.
When changing text — whether you’re adding or deleting — Acrobat tries 
to use the font that was specified in the original document. Sometimes, this 
font is built into the PDF file, which means that it’s embedded in the file. 
Other times, the font may not be available either because it hasn’t been 
embedded or it’s been embedded as a subset where only some of the char-
acters from the font are included in the PDF file. In these cases, Acrobat may 
provide the following warning message:
All or part of the selection has no available system font. You cannot 
add or delete text using the currently selected font.
Fortunately, you can change the font if you need to edit the text. However, 
when you change the font, the text may not retain the same appearance as 
the original document. In some instances, you may not have the exact same 
font on your computer as the font used in the PDF document, but you may 
have a similar font you can use without causing a noticeable change — most 
people won’t notice the difference between Helvetica and Arial or between 
Times and Times New Roman. Fonts with the same name but from different 
font designers often look very similar. For example, Adobe Garamond looks 
similar to ITC Garamond, even though they’re two different fonts.
To change the font that’s used for a word or a range of words, follow 
these steps:

1. With the TouchUp Text tool, drag over the text you wish to select.
 
 You may get a Loading System Fonts message followed by another 
Loading Document Fonts message. Depending on the number of 
fonts installed on your system, it may take a while for this message to 
disappear.
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the highlighted text and 
choose Properties from the contextual menu.
 
 The TouchUp Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2:

dialog box.
 
 
3. In the Text tab, choose the typeface you want to use from the Font 
drop-down list and make any other changes you want.
 
 In this dialog box, you can also change the size by selecting or typing a 
number into the Font Size drop-down list. In addition, you can modify 
the color by clicking the Fill color swatch.
 
4. When you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Close button to 
apply your changes to the selected text.
Using the TouchUp Object tool to edit graphics
You can use the TouchUp Object tool to access editing software for modify-
ing graphics. For example, you can use the TouchUp Object tool to select a 
graphic, bring the graphic into Photoshop, and then save the modified ver-
sion back into the PDF file. In other words, you can edit the graphics used in 
PDF documents, even if you don’t have access to the original graphic files.
To edit a photographic file from Acrobat in Photoshop, follow these steps:

Editing Text
526
 
1. Select the image with the TouchUp Object tool, right-click (Windows) 
or Control-click (Mac) on a photographic image with the TouchUp 
Object tool, and then choose Edit Image from the contextual menu.
 
 The image file opens in Adobe Photoshop.
 
2. With the many tools of Photoshop, make the necessary changes to the 
graphic and then choose File➪Save.
 
 When you return to the PDF file in Acrobat, the graphic is updated auto-
matically in the PDF document.
 
If you have the original graphic file, it remains untouched — only the version 
used within the PDF file is modified. It isn’t necessary to have the original 
graphic file to perform these steps.
You can also use Acrobat to edit vector objects from within PDF files, such 
as those created with Adobe Illustrator. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select a piece of vector artwork with the TouchUp Object tool, right-
click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the vector artwork, and then 
choose Edit Object from the contextual menu.
 
 Note: Acrobat displays Edit Object in the contextual menu if it detects 
a vector object, and it displays Edit Image if it detects a bitmap image. 
Acrobat also displays Edit Objects (note the plural) if you have more 
than one object selected.
 
 If you’re editing a complex illustration, be sure to select all its compo-
nents by holding down the Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) key while clicking 
them with the TouchUp Object tool.
 
 After choosing Edit Object, the object opens for editing in Adobe 
Illustrator.
 
2. Make the necessary changes in Illustrator, choose File➪Save.
 
 The graphic is updated in the PDF document.
 
If Acrobat doesn’t start Photoshop or Illustrator after choosing the Edit 
Image or Edit Object command, you may need to access preferences by 
choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Touch Up and then specifying which programs 
should be used for editing images or objects.
 
You can also use the TouchUp Object tool to edit the position of text or 
graphic objects on a page, which includes the ability to relocate individual 
lines of text or to change the position of a graphic on a page. After you select 
an object with the TouchUp Object tool, you can simply drag it to a new 
location on the page.

Exporting Text and Graphics
Although editing text and graphics is helpful, you may need to take text 
or images from a PDF document and use them in another file. Fortunately, 
Acrobat also includes tools to make this a breeze. Of course, you should 
always make certain that you have the permission of the owner of a docu-
ment before reusing content that isn’t your original work.
You need the Select & Zoom toolbar for extracting text and graphics, so 
make sure that it’s visible. If it isn’t, choose View➪Toolbars➪Select & Zoom.
You can export text, images, or charts from Acrobat by copying and pasting, 
by saving as a specific file type, or by using the Snapshot tool. These meth-
ods are discussed in detail in the following sections.
Exporting text with Select, Copy, and Paste
Make sure that the Select & Zoom toolbar is visible (choose 
View➪Toolbars➪Select & Zoom) and then follow these steps to select, copy, 
and paste text from a PDF file:
 
1. With the Select tool, highlight the text you want to export.
 
 The Select tool is the I-bar/black arrow in the toolbar. When you hold 
the arrow over a section of your document, it turns into an I-bar cursor, 
which you can drag to select the text you want to copy.
 
 If the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands are unavailable after you’ve 
selected some text, the author of the document may have set the secu-
rity settings to disallow copying. If you can’t select the text, you may be 
trying to copy text that is part of an image.
You can use the Typewriter tool to type any-
where on the document. This tool resembles 
the Text Box tool, though its default prop-
erties are different. Access the Typewriter 
tool by choosing Tools➪Typewriter➪Show 
Typewriter Toolbar. Then select the Typewriter 
icon, position your cursor where you want to 
begin typing and type, pressing the Enter or 
Return key whenever you want to add a line. 
The Increase and Decrease size buttons will 
enlarge or diminish your type size.
Likewise, to change the leading, you select the 
text and click the Increase or Decrease Line 
Spacing buttons. You can move or resize the 
Typewriter block by selecting it with the Select 
tool and either moving or resizing the text box. 
Your text remains editable. So, if you’ve made 
a mistake and want to correct it, or want to add 
or delete text, you select the Typewriter tool 
again and double-click in the type box.

2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the selected text and 
choose Copy from the contextual menu.
 
 Being able to extract the text out of a PDF document by selecting and 
copying it is useful if you don’t have access to the original source docu-
ment, but you need to use the text from a PDF file.
 
3. Open another text-editing program, such as Adobe InDesign or 
Microsoft Word.
 
 You can paste the copied text into a new document or a preexisting file.
 
4. Insert your cursor in the document at the appropriate spot and choose 
File➪Paste or Edit➪Paste.
 
 The text is pasted into the document, ready for you to use.
Exporting text with Save As
The File➪Save As command exports all the text in your PDF file. The Save 
as Type drop-down list gives you various format options. After choosing an 
option and any settings, click the OK button to select the settings and click 
the Save button to save the text. The File➪Export command gives you the 
same options.
Here are the formats you can use to export text:
 
✦ Microsoft Word Document: Click the Settings button to choose whether 
to save the comments or images with your document. If you choose 
to save the comments or images, you can select additional formatting 
options.
 
✦ Rich Text Format: Click the Settings button to choose whether to save 
the comments or images with your document. If you choose to save the 
comments or images, you can select additional formatting options.
 
✦ Text (Accessible): Use this format to create a file that can be printed to a 
Braille printer.
 
✦ Text (Plain) (Secondary Settings): This format creates a plain vanilla file 
with no formatting. You can save some secondary options in various file 
encodings. Also, you can select to save the images in your PDF in a sepa-
rate images folder.
 
✦ Encapsulated PostScript, PostScript: These formats are generally used 
by commercial printers or IT professionals that need PostScript output.
 
✦ Various Adobe PDF options, such as PDF/E for engineering or PDF/A 
for archiving: These are used to switch to a specific subset of the PDF 
file format used for a particular industry or line of work.
 
✦ Various graphics formats (JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG, TIFF): If you choose 
one of these options, your text will no longer be editable as the entire 
PDF pages are converted to an image.

Book V
Chapter 4
Editing and

and Graphics

529
 
Text that’s copied from a PDF file is no longer linked to the original docu-
ment. Edits made to the extracted text aren’t reflected within the PDF file, 
and it’s extremely difficult to have the extracted text reinserted into the PDF 
document. Think of the extraction process as a one-way trip for the text, 
which can be extracted but not reinserted.
You can also copy text within a table to the Clipboard or open it directly in a 
spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, and maintain the table’s for-
matting after it’s extracted. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Select tool and click and drag to select the text in the table.
 
 Depending upon how the table was created, you may also be able to 
position your cursor just outside the edge of the table and then draw a 
box around a table.
 
 A border appears around the selected table.
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) and choose Open Table 
in Spreadsheet from the contextual menu.
 
 Alternatively, you can save the table directly to a file or copy to the 
Clipboard to be pasted later: If Acrobat has trouble identifying the text 
in the table, it may be saved as an image file, which is not editable text.
 
• To save the table directly to a file, choose Save as Table from the con-
textual menu.
 
• To copy the table to the Clipboard so that you can paste it into other 
documents, choose Copy as Table from the contextual menu.
 
 The table opens in Excel or whatever spreadsheet program you have 
installed on your computer.
 
 And that’s it. You can now use that table in another program.
Snapshot tool
You can use the Snapshot tool to select both text and images and create a 
picture of a certain area within a PDF file. The result is commonly referred 
to as a screen grab of a section within a PDF file. The result is an image, and 
your text is no longer editable.
To use the Snapshot tool, choose Tools➪Select & Zoom➪Snapshot Tool. 
You then have two options.
 
✦ After you select the Snapshot tool, click anywhere in the page. The snap-
shot tool automatically captures everything displayed on the screen.
 
✦ After you select the Snapshot tool, click and drag a rectangle around an 
area of the page.

Exporting Text and Graphics
530
You can include text and images. The area you’ve selected will be saved to 
the Clipboard so that you can paste it into another document. The Snapshot 
tool remains active so that you can keep selecting areas and saving them to 
the Clipboard. However, the previous selection in your Clipboard is deleted 
when you make a new selection. So, make certain you’ve pasted a selection 
into your other document before you make a new selection.
 
You have to select another tool to deactivate the Snapshot tool.
You can also extract graphics from PDF files, 
but extracting graphics is very different from 
editing them. We discuss editing graphics and 
vector objects earlier in this chapter. When 
editing graphics, you open the original graphic 
file at its highest possible quality. Extracting 
graphics is different because they’re removed 
at the quality of the screen display resolution, 
which may be of much lower quality than the 
original, embedded graphics.
With the Select tool, right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac) an image, or drag with the 
Select tool to select a part of the image. Then 
you can either drag and drop the selection into 
an open document or choose Copy Image from 
the contextual menu. The image is now avail-
able to be pasted into other applications. The 
other option in the contextual menu is to Save 
Image As and save the selected area as a BMP 
graphics file.

Chapter 5: Using Commenting 
and Annotation Tools
In This Chapter
✓ Adding comments to PDF files
✓ Working with comments
O
ne of the fantastic features of Acrobat is the capability to mark up 
documents electronically with virtual sticky notes, or comments. You 
can mark up text to indicate changes and add annotations and drawing com-
ments to a PDF (Portable Document Format) file. The Acrobat commenting 
tools don’t change the original file, and you can remove the comments at 
any time, which means you can disable comments for printing or viewing 
at any time. In this chapter, we describe these great features and show you 
how to put them to work for you.
Creating Comments with the Comment 
& Markup Toolbar
You can easily add annotations to PDF files, including stamps, text high-
lights, callouts, and electronic sticky notes by using the Comment & Markup 
toolbar, which you can access by clicking the Comment option in the Tasks 
toolbar. You can then choose Show the Comment & Markup Tools.
 
You can also access the Comment & Markup toolbar by choosing 
View➪Toolbars➪Comment & Markup.
The Comment & Markup toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-1, provides several 
tools for adding comments to PDF documents. It also includes a Show menu 
to help manage comments and the process of adding comments. We discuss 
these tools in the following sections.

The Sticky Note tool
Use the Sticky Note tool to add electronic sticky notes to your files. You can 
click the location where you want the note to appear within a PDF docu-
ment. An icon, representing the note, appears, along with a window where 
you can enter text. After entering text in the sticky note, close the window so 
that the document isn’t hidden beneath it.
You can change the icon and color used to represent the note by right-click-
ing (Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac) the note and choosing Properties 
from the contextual menu. In the Properties dialog box that appears, make 
the changes to the note icon or color and then click Close.
The Text Edits tool
The Text Edits tool is actually six separate text commenting tools. Use these 
tools to replace selected text, highlight selected text, add a note to selected 
text, insert text at cursor, underline selected text, and cross out text for 
deletion.
To use the Text Edits tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the Text Edits tool and drag to select text that requires a 
change or comment.
 
2. Click the arrow to the right of the Text Edits tool to access the drop-
down list containing your six choices.
 
3. Choose an option from the list of available editing choices:
 
• Replace Selected Text: Replaces the selected text.
 
• Highlight Selected Text: Highlights the selected text.
 
• Add a Note to Selected Text: Allows you to add a note to the 
selected text.
 
• Insert Text at Cursor: Places a cursor at the end of the selected text.

 Your selected text changes, depending on what you choose from the list.
 
After selecting the text that requires a comment, you can press the Delete or 
Backspace key to indicate a text edit to remove the text. Similarly, you can 
start to type, and Acrobat will create an insertion point. Also, if you right-
click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) after selecting the text, you can select 
the type of edit or comment you want to insert from the contextual menu.
The Stamp tool
You can use stamps to identify documents or to highlight a certain part of 
a document. Common stamps include Confidential, Draft, Sign Here, and 
Approved.
The stamps are grouped into sections. Some stamps automatically add your 
default username along with the date and time you applied them to the 
document; these stamps are available under the Dynamic category in the 
Stamps menu. The more traditional business stamps, such as Confidential, 
appear under the Standard Business category. You can access each of the 
different categories by clicking the arrow to the right of the Stamp tool in the 
Comment & Markup toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-2.

3. In the Add Attachment dialog box, browse to the file that you want to 
attach and click the Select button.
 
 You can attach text, graphic, or sound files.
 
4. Select the type of icon to represent the attached file and then click OK.
 
 Several types of icons can represent the attached file. You can select a 
paperclip, a graph, a pushpin, or a tag. Whatever icon you select appears 
on your document to denote that another file is attached. When you roll 
over the icon, a little annotation appears telling you the filename.
 
 With the Record Audio Comment tool, you can share a verbal comment 
by using a microphone and a recording a message directly into the PDF. 
The sound is added as a comment.
 
The file(s) that you attach with the Attach File tools becomes embedded 
within the PDF file. The attached file remains in its original file format, even 
if the attached file isn’t a PDF file. For example, you can attach an Excel 
spreadsheet to a PDF document.
The drawing tools
There are three shape tools, two line tools, and a pencil in the Comment & 
Markup toolbar. Use the drawing tools to add lines, ovals, rectangles, and 
other shapes to your PDF file. These shapes can call attention to specific 
portions of a document.
To use the Cloud Shape tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Cloud Shape tool from the Comment & Markup toolbar.
 
2. Click in your document to begin the shape.
 
3. Click again in another position to set the length of the first part of the 
cloud and then click again to begin shaping your cloud.
 
 Click as often as you like to create your shape.
 
4. When you’re finished with your shape, double-click to close the 
cloud shape.
 
5. While the Cloud Shape tool is selected, click the shape you created 
and drag the corner points to resize, if necessary.
 
6. After creating the cloud shape, right-click (Windows) or Control-click 
(Mac) the shape and choose Properties from the contextual menu to 
change the color and thickness of the line values; when you’re fin-
ished, click OK.
 
 You can also use the Style drop-down list in the Properties dialog box 
to change the appearance of a selected comment. Instead of the cloud 
edges, you can change them to dotted lines, dashed lines, and so on.

The Text Box tool
When creating notes that you want to prominently display on a document, 
you can use the Text Box tool.
Follow these steps to add a text box to hold your comments:
 
1. Select the Text Box tool from the Comment & Markup toolbar.
 
 A text field is placed directly on the document.
 
2. Drag to add the comment.
 
3. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) and choose Properties 
from the contextual menu to set the color of the text box that contains 
the note.
 
4. Make your choices to modify the appearance of the text box and then 
click OK.
 
You can select the text box and move it to another position any time you 
want. You can resize the text box by dragging an anchor point.
The Callout tool
The Callout tool creates a callout text box that points to a section of your 
document with an arrow. The callout text box is made up of three parts: the 
text box, the knee line, and the end point line. You can resize each part indi-
vidually to customize the callout area of your document.
To use the Callout tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Callout tool from the Comment & Markup toolbar.

and then click OK.
 
You can select the callout text box and move it to another position any time 
you want. You can resize the text box by dragging an anchor point.
The Pencil tool
With the Pencil tool, you can create freeform lines on your documents. 
These lines can be useful when you’re trying to attract attention to a specific 
portion of a page. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Pencil tool from the Comment & Markup toolbar.
 
2. Click and drag to draw on your document.
 
3. Edit the color and thickness of lines created with the Pencil tool by 
right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac) the line and choos-
ing Properties from the contextual menu.
 
 Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+E (Windows) or Ô+E (Mac) to access 
the Properties toolbar.
 
4. Make your choices and click OK.
 
By right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac) the Pencil tool, you 
can choose the Pencil Eraser tool. Use the Pencil Eraser tool to remove por-
tions of lines that had previously been created with the Pencil tool.
Managing Comments
One of the most powerful features of PDF commenting is the ability to easily 
manage and share comments and annotations among reviewers. For exam-
ple, you can determine which comments are displayed at any time, and you 
can filter the comments by author or by the type of commenting tool used to 
create the comment. In addition, you can indicate a response to a comment 
and track the changes that may have been made to a document based upon 
a comment. Also, you can consolidate comments from multiple reviewers 
into a single document.

Managing Comments
538
Viewing comments
You can use any of several methods to see a document’s list of comments:
 
✦ Click the Comments tab along the bottom left side of the document 
window in the Navigation panel.
 
✦ Choose Comment➪Show Comments List.
 
✦ Choose View➪Navigation Panels➪Comments.
No matter which method you use, the Comments List window that shows all 
the comments in the document appears along the bottom of the Document 
window. You can see the author of each comment and any notes entered by 
reviewers. By clicking the plus sign to the left of a comment, you can view 
more information about it, such as what type of comment it is and the date 
and time it was created.
 
If you’ve clicked the plus sign to the left of the comment to expand the view, 
it changes to a minus sign, which you can then click to return to the consoli-
dated view showing only the author and the initial portions of any text from 
the note.
To the right of the plus sign is a check box that you can use to indicate that 
the comment has been reviewed or to indicate that a certain comment needs 
further attention. Use these check boxes for your own purposes; their status 
doesn’t export with the document if you send the file to others, so they’re 
for your personal use only.
Changing a comment’s review status
Acrobat makes it easy to indicate whether a comment has been reviewed, 
accepted, or has additional comments attached to it.
To change the status of a comment, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Comments➪Show Comments List to see the entire list of com-
ments and the status of each one.
 
 You can also click the Comments tab located on the bottom left side of 
the screen to display the comments.
 
2. In the Comments List, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) a 
comment and choose Set Status➪Review from the contextual menu.
 
3. Select Accepted, Rejected, Cancelled, or Completed, depending on 
what’s appropriate to your situation.
 
 The comment you modified appears in the list, showing the new status 
you assigned to it.

Replying to a comment
You can right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) a comment in the 
Comments List and choose Reply from the contextual menu to add a follow-
up note to the comment. This way, new comments can be tied to existing 
comments. If your documents go through multiple rounds of review, adding 
a reply allows a secondary or final reviewer to expand on the comments 
from an initial reviewer. This also allows an author or designer to clearly 
respond to the suggestions from an editor.
Collapsing or hiding comments
Because the Comments List can become rather large, you can choose to 
collapse all comments so that only the page number on which comments 
appear is displayed in the list. To do so, click the Collapse All button in the 
upper left of the Comments List window; it has a minus sign next to it. To 
view all comments, click the Expand All button in the same location; this 
button has a plus sign next to it.
To hide all the comments within a document, click and hold the Show button 
on the Commenting toolbar and choose Hide All Comments. You can then 
click the Show button in the Comments toolbar and choose to show com-
ments based upon
 
✦ Type of comment, such as note, line, or cross out
 
✦ Reviewer, such as Bob or Jane
 
✦ Status, such as accepted or rejected
 
✦ Checked State, which can be checked or unchecked
Use these filtering options to view only those comments that are relevant 
to you.
Sharing comments
You can share your comments with other reviewers who have access to the 
same PDF document by following these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the Comments List is visible by clicking the Comments 
tab on the bottom left of the Document window.
 
2. Select the comment that you want to export by clicking it (Shift+click 
for multiple selections).
 
3. From the Comments List window, choose Options➪Export Selected 
Comments.
 
 The Export Comments dialog box appears.

Managing Comments
540
 
4. Browse to the location where you want the comments to be saved and 
give the saved file a new name.
 
 You now have a file that includes only the comments’ information, and 
not the entire PDF file.
You can share your file with reviewers who have the same PDF file, and they 
can choose Options➪Import Comments in the Comments List window to add 
the comments into their document. You can use this method to avoid send-
ing entire PDF files to those who already have the document.
Summarizing comments
You can compile a list of all the comments from a PDF file into a new, sepa-
rate document. To summarize comments, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Comments List window, choose Options➪Summarize 
Comments.
 
 The Summarize Options dialog box appears.
 
2. Create a listing of the comments with lines connecting them to their 
locations on the page by selecting the radio button from the top — 
Document and Connector Lines on a Single Page.
 
 In the Include section, you can choose which comments should be 
summarized.
 
3. Click the Create PDF Comment Summary button.
 
 This step creates a new PDF document that simply lists all the com-
ments, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Chapter 6: Securing Your PDF Files
In This Chapter
✓ Finding out about security in Acrobat
✓ Using passwords
✓ Setting limits for editing and printing
You may think that because you’ve converted your documents to PDF 
(Portable Document Format) that they’re secure. This isn’t quite true 
because Adobe Acrobat includes tools for changing text and images, as well 
as extracting them for use in other files. For example, you can use the Select 
tool (see Chapter 4 of this minibook) to select and copy a passage of text or 
the Select Object tool to copy or edit graphics.
Applying security provides you with control over who can view, edit, or 
print the PDF documents you distribute. You can restrict access to certain 
features, which deters most users from manipulating your files. All Adobe 
applications recognize and honor security settings applied in Acrobat, but 
some software ignores Adobe’s security settings or can bypass them all 
together. For this reason, we recommend that you share your most sensitive 
PDF documents only when you’ve applied security protection. This way, the 
only users who can open a file are those who know the password or have the 
correct certificate, depending upon the type of security applied to the file.
In this chapter, we discuss using security protection to limit access to PDF 
files and show you how to limit what users can do to the contents of your 
PDF documents.
Understanding Password Security
By requiring users to enter a password to open and view your PDF files, you 
limit access to those files so that only certain users can view them. You can 
also apply security to limit access to certain Acrobat and Adobe Reader fea-
tures, such as copying text or graphics, editing the file, and printing. Adobe 
calls this type of security password security because it requires a password 
to either open the document or to change the security that’s been applied 
to the document.
Apply security options to limit the opening or editing of your PDF docu-
ment, restricting these capabilities to users who have been provided the 
proper password. This is done by clicking the Secure button on the Tasks 
toolbar. If the Secure button isn’t visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪Tasks.

Understanding Password Security
544
Click and hold down the Secure button in the Tasks toolbar and choose 
2 Encrypt with Password to bring up the Password Security - Settings 
dialog box.
In the Password Security - Settings dialog box, choose an Acrobat version 
from the Compatibility drop-down list. The higher the version of Acrobat, 
the greater the level of security.
Your choice here is based on your needs for security and also the version 
of Acrobat or Adobe Reader that your audience uses. Lower versions of 
Acrobat provide more compatibility with the widest number of viewers, as 
they support much older versions of the free Adobe Reader. In the following 
list, we explain the compatibility choices before showing you how to enable 
security in the following sections:
 
✦ Acrobat 3 and Later: If the users who receive your PDF files may have 
older versions of the software, you can choose Acrobat 3 and Later from 
the Compatibility drop-down list to ensure that the recipients can view 
the PDF file you’re securing. This option provides compatibility for users 
who may not have updated their software in many years, but the level 
of security is limited to 40-bit encryption. Although this amount keeps 
the average user from gaining access to your files, it won’t deter a deter-
mined hacker from accessing them and can be easily circumvented by a 
sophisticated user.
 
✦ Acrobat 5 and Later: When sharing files with users who have access 
to Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat Version 5 or 6, this option provides 
expanded security, increasing the security level to 128-bit, which makes 
the resulting PDF files more difficult to access. Along with the enhanced 
security, you can also secure the files while still allowing access to the 
file for visually-impaired users. Earlier versions of security don’t pro-
vide this option, but it’s included when you choose either Acrobat 5- or 
6-compatible security.
 
✦ Acrobat 6 and Later: Along with the enhanced security offered with 
Acrobat 5 compatibility, this setting adds the ability to maintain plain 
text metadata. In short, this option allows for information about the file, 
such as its author, title, or creation date, to remain visible while the 
remainder of the file remains secure.
 
✦ Acrobat 7 and Later: This choice includes all security options of 
Acrobat 6 compatibility and also allows you to encrypt file attachments 
that are part of a PDF file. It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard, 
which is a very high level of encryption, making it unlikely that an unau-
thorized user can decrypt the file without the password.
 
✦ Acrobat 9 and Later: Choose this option if your audience is using the 
latest version of Acrobat and you need more advanced security. The 
encryption improves to 256-bit AES, making the file much more difficult 
for even the most determined hacker to access.

Files
Applying Password Security to Your PDF Documents

Applying Password Security to Your PDF Documents
Selecting the Encrypt with Password option from the Secure button in the 
Acrobat task bar limits access to the PDF file. Only those who know the 
password can open the file. Documents are only as secure as the passwords 
that protect them. To guard against discovery of a password, use passwords 
that are six or more characters in length and include at least one number or 
symbol. Avoid using words in the dictionary and short passwords. For exam-
ple, the password potato is less secure than p0tat0, which mixes numbers 
and letters.
To apply password security to a file, follow these steps:
 
1. With a PDF file open, click and hold the Secure button on the Security 
taskbar and choose Encrypt with Password.
 
 Click OK when the dialog box appears, verifying that you want to 
apply security to this PDF. The Password Security - Settings dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
The

Security - 
Settings 
dialog box.
 
 
2. Choose Acrobat 7 and Later from the Compatibility drop-down list.
 
 Although Acrobat 9 and later provides more robust security, few people 
are using version 9 of Acrobat, making it difficult to distribute the file 
with this high level of security.
 
3. Select the Require a Password to Open the Document check box.

Limiting Editing and Printing
546
 
4. Enter a password in the Document Open Password text box.
 
 You can also add additional security settings, which we outline in the 
next section. Or you can use this setting as the only security to be 
applied to the document.
 
 If password protection is the only security measure you apply to the 
document, authorized users can access the document by entering a 
password. Users with the password may also be able to edit or print the 
document unless you apply additional security measures. We discuss 
ways to limit the editing and printing of PDF files in the next section.
 
5. Click OK.
 
6. Confirm the password, click OK again, and the dialog box closes.
 
7. Save, close, and then reopen the PDF file.
 
 A password dialog box appears asking for the password to access 
the secured file. Every time a user accesses the file, he or she will be 
required to enter a password.
Limiting Editing and Printing
In addition to restricting viewing of a PDF file, you can also limit editing and 
printing, restricting users from making changes to your document. This 
allows users to view a file but not change it. 
To limit editing and printing of your PDF document, follow these steps:
 
1. With a PDF file open, click and hold the Secure button on the Security 
taskbar and choose Encrypt with Password.
 
 The Password Security - Settings dialog box opens.
 
2. In the Permissions area, select the check box labeled Restrict Editing 
and Printing of the document.
 
 You can now specify a password that will be required for readers to edit 
the file or change the security settings. (See the previous section.)
 
 With this option selected, you can apply a password for access to fea-
tures, such as printing or editing. This password can be different than 
the password used to open the document — in fact, you don’t even need 
to use a document open password if you don’t want to, but it’s a good 
idea to use both of these passwords for sensitive data. If you apply a 
document open password without a permissions password, it’s easy for 
an experienced user to bypass the security in the PDF file.
 
3. In the Change Permissions Password text box, enter a password.

Book V
Chapter 6
Securing Your PDF 
Files
Limiting Editing and Printing
547
 
 Users that enter this permissions password when opening the document 
can change the file or the security settings. The permissions password 
can also be used to open the file and provides more privileges than the 
open password.
 
4. Choose whether users can print the document by selecting from the 
Printing Allowed drop-down list.
 
 The choices include Low Resolution or High Resolution, or you can 
prohibit printing by choosing None. The settings you choose here 
apply to anyone who accesses the document and doesn’t know the 
permissions password.
 
5. Choose from the Changes Allowed drop-down list (see Figure 6-2) to 
restrict editing.
 
 For the most security, choose None.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Restrict 
what users 
can edit.
 
 
6. Select the last two check boxes if desired:
 
• Enable Copying of Text, Images, and Other Content: When dese-
lected, this option restricts copying and pasting of text and graph-
ics from a PDF file into other documents. Selecting this option lets 
users extract text and images from a file by using the simple Copy 
and Paste commands.

Limiting Editing and Printing
548
 
• Enable Text Access for Screen Reader Devices for the Visually 
Impaired: When you choose Acrobat 5 or Later from the 
Compatibility drop-down list at the top of the dialog box, you can 
also select this check box to allow visually impaired users to have 
the PDF file read aloud to them.
 
7. When you’re satisfied with the settings, click OK.
 
Choosing more advanced security settings, and choosing the latest version 
of compatibility, runs the risk of your file not being visible to many users 
that may not have upgraded. Always understand your audience and the soft-
ware versions they’re using before distributing files.

reamweaver CS4 lets you create and manage single pages, such as 
e-mail newsletters or groups of pages that are linked to each other, 
referred to as a site. Users can create basic Web sites with simple links from 
one page to another or advanced Web sites that include custom coding and 
interaction with those viewing the pages.
Since being included as part of the Adobe Creative Suite, Dreamweaver CS4 
has been made to work better than ever with other Adobe applications, such 
as Photoshop CS4, Illustrator CS4, Bridge, and Device Central. Even if you’ve 
never used Dreamweaver, you’ll be impressed with the many tools, panels, 
and powerful features that make Web-page building easy and intuitive.
If you’re a GoLive user, moving to Dreamweaver is actually a smooth tran-
sition. Dreamweaver CS4 is an industry-standard Web site creation and 
management tool, with the tools needed to do advanced coding or create 
data-driven Web sites.
All New CS4 Interface
New and previous Dreamweaver users alike will be excited to see 
the new interface that’s been put into place in Dreamweaver CS4, as 
shown in Figure 1-1. A more streamlined, easy-to-organize interface and 
improved relocation and redesign of some key panels mean a better 
workflow. You’ll even find some new workspace presets that are suited 
for different types of Dreamweaver users, including those geared for 
designers and hardcore coders.

The panels are tabbed, and you can separate them by dragging the tab 
to another location, just as in other Adobe applications. If you choose 
View➪Toolbars➪Standard, you can even use the Go to Bridge button to 
navigate and use Adobe Bridge. Using Adobe Bridge with Dreamweaver CS4 
is a big improvement, as you can search and navigate your assets, such as 
text, Flash, and images files. You can then drag and drop them right on to 
your page. (Read more about adding imagery to your Web page in Chapter 4 
of this minibook.)
Improved Property Inspector Panel
The Dreamweaver Property inspector is now split into two views! The 
Property inspector is your all-purpose detail view for anything you select 
on the page. It’s been improved to include specific views for HTML and CSS 
tasks: On the HTML tab, you can work specifically on tag and structural ele-
ments, or switch to the CSS tab to apply, create, and edit CSS formatting for 
a selected element (see Figure 1-2).

The HTML view lets you work specifically with HTML elements and apply basic 
formatting with HTML as well as create bullet-point lists and set text alignment.
The CSS view lets you create, edit, and apply CSS selectors (styles) to text 
and other page elements. This view provides more control than previous 
versions for modifying and naming styles, and lets you create any type of 
selector you need, when you need it.

Photoshop Smart Objects
The addition of Photoshop support in Dreamweaver CS3 was a huge work-
flow improvement for designers, and now version CS4 takes it further with 
full support for Photoshop Smart Objects, which allow you to maintain a link 
to the original PSD file so that edits are easily recorded and applied to the 
optimized image in your page.
Images placed from PSD files display a handy icon (as shown in Figure 1-3), 
which lets you know if its original file has changed, and the Update from 
Original button (located on the Property inspector) automatically regener-
ates and updates your image from the original Photoshop file.
In addition, Dreamweaver CS4 continues to support direct placement of 
Photoshop (.psd) files, allowing full optimization and creation of Web-
friendly formats on the fly! This speeds up your workflow by letting you do 
more in Dreamweaver without jumping between different applications.
Browser Compatibility Check and the CSS Advisor
The Browser Compatibility Check (BCC) was introduced in Dreamweaver 
CS3 and allows you to check if CSS rules used within your page will work 
and appear consistently in most modern browsers on both Mac and 
Windows platforms.

icon in the 
corner of 
an image 
to let you 
know when 
the image 
needs to 
be updated 
from the 
original.
 
If the Browser Compatibility Check finds any compatibility issues, you’ll see 
them in the Results panel with an explanation of the problem (and browser 
version, if applicable). BCC also provides a direct link to Adobe’s new CSS 
resource site, the CSS Advisor, for possible solutions or workarounds to 
your specific issue.
Adobe’s CSS Advisor is an online resource portal that helps find and address 
common solutions to many CSS-related issues and questions. Best of all, it’s 
just a click away from the Browser Compatibility Check!
 
You can visit Adobe’s CSS Advisor Web site directly at www.adobe.com/
cfusion/communityengine/index.
cfm?event=homepage&productId=1.
To use this feature, select the Check Page button on the Document toolbar. (If 
you don’t see your Document toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars➪Document.) 
From the Check Page drop-down list, choose Check Browser Compatibility. 
The Browser Compatibility tab appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Very often, solutions to your problem can be addressed in the CSS Styles 
panel, or in some cases, may involve editing some code by hand. (Read 
about the basics of coding and HTML in Chapter 3 of this minibook.)

Live View
Dreamweaver adds a new Document view — the Live View — making it pos-
sible to see your page in a browser-simulated environment without leaving the 
application. Live View displays your page just as it would in a Web browser, as 
shown in Figure 1-5, allowing you to get a more accurate view of your work.
Code Navigator
 
 The new Code Navigator, as shown in Figure 1-6, helps you easily target and 
edit code included on or applied to elements on your page. Page content 
controlled by or with external code appears with a steering wheel icon, and 
a small window displays any external code, such as CSS rules or parent 
library item files so that you can jump to them for quick editing in Split view.
This is a huge help when working with lots of CSS rules and JavaScript code, 
as locating these manually to make changes can be a very tedious process.

New Spry Widgets
The Spry Framework isn’t covered in detail in this book, but you should 
at least be familiar with what it allows you to create. The Spry Framework 
helps users, beginner to advanced, take advantage of interactive page ele-
ments and cool widgets commonly used within rich-internet applications 
built in AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).
AJAX is a Web-development technique for creating interactive Web appli-
cations. The intention is to make Web pages feel more responsive by 
exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes so that 
the entire Web page doesn’t have to reload each time the user requests a 
change. By not reloading the entire page, you can increase the Web page’s 
interactivity, speed, and usability. Still confused? Check out the samples on 
Adobe Labs at http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry.
Dreamweaver CS4 includes a collection of objects (a library) that contains 
ready-to-use Spry elements, such as cool drop-down lists, tabbed panels, 
and page elements that automatically update from XML files. When one of 
these elements is placed on a page, it creates an area that can change with-
out the entire page reloading. For example, a user can create a photo gallery 
in which a person can click a smaller image and see a larger image with a 
Spry Framework library item.
This feature is really worth investigating, especially if you’re leaning 
toward including more sophisticated interactivity on your page. The Spry 
Framework contains Spry widgets and data objects, which are commonly 
used elements that you can easily add to pages without complex code. 
Widgets include form elements, database tables, and menu bars.
The Spry widgets, including some cool new validating form objects and data 
elements can be found under the Insert panel’s Spry category, and some wid-
gets are also available from the Insert panel’s Layout category.
You can also use Spry effects to apply fun transition effects, such as grow 
and shrink, appear and fade, and shake, to objects on the page. Because 
these effects are based on the Spry Framework, when the transition is 
applied, only the object is affected.
Related Documents
Very often, your pages rely on several other files, such as attached style 
sheets and JavaScript files. The Document toolbar now includes a Related 
Documents section, where you can see and jump to other documents uti-
lized by and attached to your page. Selecting a document in the Related 

Improved CSS Capabilities
558
Documents toolbar displays a special Split view where you can edit the 
selected file in Code view while continuing to work with the original page in 
Design view below, as shown in Figure 1-7.
The best part is you don’t have to jump between multiple Document windows; 
just edit while you watch the changes applied to your document!

Improved CSS Capabilities
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that gives Web-site developers 
and users more control over how text is formatted and pages are displayed. 
With CSS, designers and users can create style sheets that define how differ-
ent elements, such as headers and links, appear and then apply these style 
sheets to any Web page. If you’re familiar with paragraph and character 
styles in InDesign and Illustrator, you’ll understand the concept of CSS. In 
addition, CSS provides a powerful way of creating full Web-page layouts, a 
method that’s been adopted by most Web designers and developers as the 
new standard.

Book VI

In addition, CSS provides a wealth of additional attributes that you can 
apply to a page’s format and text and the ability to make changes across an 
entire Web site quickly. Although Dreamweaver has provided full support 
for CSS for some time now, CS4 offers some great new convenience features 
that make it even easier to manage and create CSS styles directly from the 
Property inspector (available by choosing Window➪Properties).
Direct formatting and CSS styling from the Property inspector provide three 
new key improvements:
 
✦ You name CSS rules at creation time (which avoids lots of vaguely 
named rules) and have the ability to set the type of CSS selector you 
want to create.
 
✦ You can add a new CSS rule to either an internal (in-page) or external 
(outside file) style sheet. Previously, the Property inspector could 
create styles only within the page itself (internal), even when an external 
style sheet existed.
 
✦ You have more control — you can determine whether modifications 
to an existing style generate a new rule or modify the existing one (the 
default).
 
The words rule and style are used interchangeably here and in other chap-
ters throughout this minibook. The proper term, however, for a new set of 
CSS attributes in CSS-speak is rule.

reamweaver CS4 lets you create and manage Web pages and complete 
Web sites. In this chapter, you find out how to start a Web site and 
build pages within it. Basically, a Web site is simply a group of linked pages 
that contain text and images and can also contain media, such as Flash 
movies, sound and video.
Getting to Know the New Workspace Setup
As a default, most workspace options are available to you in the form of 
panels, toolbars, or inspectors. This workspace can take some getting used 
to because it isn’t totally consistent with the other Adobe applications in 
the suite.
When Dreamweaver is first launched, you see a Welcome screen. This 
screen provides the option to open any recent items (if you’ve created 
pages already), but also allows you to create new HTML, CSS, XML, sites, 
and many other files. You can also choose a selection from the Create from 
Samples column.
Dreamweaver provides you with all the tools you need in the initial work-
space (see Figure 2-1).

The Insert panel
The Dreamweaver CS4 Insert panel provides you with tools to insert 
common page elements, such as hyperlinks, e-mail links, tables, and images 
to your page, as well as more advanced coding related to CSS (Cascading 
Style Sheets) and AJAX (Spry elements).
The Insert panel is divided into eight categories that provide you with differ-
ent elements to add to your page. You can switch between these categories 
by using the drop-down list at the top of the panel.
 
✦ Common: Contains the most commonly used objects, such as images 
and tables.
 
✦ Layout: Contains layout elements, such as tables and CSS elements like 
the DIV tag, that help you create a Web page layout.
 
✦ Forms: Contains the elements necessary to create a form in your 
Dreamweaver page.
 
✦ Data: Contains elements related to dynamic content and some Spry data 
objects.

✦ Spry: Contains the new Spry Framework objects, used to create pages 
and widgets, such as Spry tables and accordion menus.
 
✦ Text: Provides you with text formatting tags.
 
✦ Favorites: Allows you to group and organize the Insert panel buttons 
you use the most within one common location.
 
✦ Extensions: Here you’ll find some more obscure properties, such as 
forced page breaks, filters, and cursor effects.
 
 To bring up the Customize Favorite Objects dialog box, simply right-
click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) within the Insert panel and 
choose Customize Favorites from the contextual menu. The Customize 
Favorite Objects dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-2, appears. Click an 
object in the Available Objects window and then click the double arrow 
to add the object to your Favorites category.
 
Figure 2-2:

The Document toolbar
The Document toolbar, as shown in Figure 2-3, contains helpful tools to 
help you view your document in different modes, such as Code and Design 
views, as well as address such items as the document title and browser 
compatibility.
 
✦ Show Code View: Show the code and only the code using this view. 
Dreamweaver helps you to decipher code by color coding tags, attri-
butes, CSS, and other elements.
 
✦ Show Code and Design Views: Selecting this option splits the Document 
window between the Code and Design views. If you understand a little 
about code, this view can be extremely helpful because you see both the 
design and code simultaneously.
 
✦ Show Design View: This option displays your page in the Design view in 
the Document window.

Getting to Know the New Workspace Setup
564
 
✦ Live View: The new Live View renders your page as you’d see it in an 
actual browser, free of borders, guides, and other visual aids. In Live 
View, you can’t edit the previewed content — however, you can still 
jump to Code, Split, or Design views and modify your page content.
 
✦ Live Code: When Live View is enabled, you can view the source code of 
your document as a user would see it in a browser (via the View Source 
or Page Source menu options in most browsers). You can’t edit your 
page code in this view.
 
✦ Related Documents: Documents utilized by and attached to your page, 
such as external CSS and JavaScript files, are listed below (Mac) or 
above (Windows) the view selection (Code/Split/Design) buttons. You 
can click any listed document to edit the attached file in Split view with-
out having to switch documents.
 
 Note: XML, JavaScript, CSS, or other code-based file types are visible 
only in Code view; the Design and Split buttons appear dimmed out.
 
✦ Document Title: Enter the name of your document in this field.
 
✦ File Management: Click this button to display the File Management 
pop-up list. Use this menu to check in and out of your document.
 
✦ Preview/Debug in Browser: Clicking this button allows you to preview or 
debug your document in a browser that you select from a drop-down list.
 
✦ Refresh Design View: Click this button to refresh the document’s Design 
view after you make changes in Code view. Changes you make in Code 
view don’t appear automatically in Design view until you perform certain 
actions, such as saving the file or clicking this button.
 
 Note: Refreshing also updates code features that are Document Object 
Model (DOM) dependent, such as the ability to select a code block’s 
opening or closing tags.
 
✦ View Options: Click and select options from the View Options drop-down 
list. This button allows you to set options for Code view and Design view, 
including which view should appear above the other. Options in the 
menu are for the current view: Design view, Code view, or both.
 
✦ Visual Aids: Click this button to select different visual aids to help you 
see various elements and make designing your pages easier.
 
✦ Validate Markup: Click this button to validate the current document or 
a selected tag.
 
✦ Check Page: This menu shows options that let you check page integrity, 
such as accessibility or whether your CSS rules are compatible across 
different browsers.

Using the panel groups
Dreamweaver provides you with a panel docking area off to the right of your 
workspace. The panels in Dreamweaver appear grouped and tabbed, and 
can easily access the appropriate panel for the job by either clicking the tab 
of the panel to bring it forward or by selecting the named panel from the 
Window menu.
Close a panel by either selecting the name of the panel from the Window 
menu or by tearing the panel out of the group and clicking the close icon.
Saving your workspace
Just like the other Creative Suite 4 applications, you can organize your work-
space by turning on the visibility of the panels and toolbars that you use on 
a regular basis and closing the others. You can also save your workspace so 
you can recall it at any time:
 
1. Choose Window➪Workspace Layout➪New Workspace.
 
 The New Workspace Layout dialog box appears.
 
2. Type an appropriate name in the name text box.
 
3. Click OK to create the new workspace.
To recall a workspace you’ve previously saved, you can either:

✦ Select the workspace from the Workspace menu in the upper-right 
corner of the screen (above the panel group).
 
 Or
 
✦ Open your workspace by choosing Window➪Workspace Layout➪[Your

Dreamweaver CS4 features several new workspaces geared toward different 
types of users as well as different tasks. You can recall any of these work-
spaces using either of the ways described in the previous list or by select-
ing a workspace from the application bar, which appears at the top of your 
screen, as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
You can hide the application toolbar by choosing View➪Application Bar.

Creating a Site
Sites are very important to maintain links, consistency, and general organiza-
tion of your Web pages. (See Chapter 3 of this minibook for more on sites.)
To create a site, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Site➪New Site.
 
 The Site Definition dialog box appears; make sure the Basic tab is 
selected at the top.
 
 This dialog box takes you through the steps to create a new site. In this 
chapter, you breeze through the steps, but you can find more details 
about them in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
 
2. In the text field below What Would You Like to Name Your Site?, type 
a name for your new site and click Next.
 
 For this example, we entered chap2 for the site’s name.

site assets into; click Next.
 
6. Choose None from the How Do You Want to Connect to Your Remote 
Server drop-down list and click Next.
 
7. Click Done in the Summary page.
 
 The site appears in the Files panel.
Checking Out the Property Inspector
After you have a site created, you can begin to add new pages as well as 
assets, such as images, to that site. The Property inspector becomes one 
of your most useful panels because it provides you with information about 
any element that you’ve selected. This contextual panel, as shown in Figure 
2-5, displays text attributes when text is selected or image attributes when 
images are selected, and so on.
 
Figure 2-5:

To see this panel in action, open a page with various elements on it. (If you 
don’t have any of your own pages yet, you can use one of the sample pages 
that loaded with your Dreamweaver CS4 installation.) Then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New to open a sample page in Dreamweaver.
 
 The New Document dialog box appears.

Previewing Your Page in a Browser or with Live View
568
 
2. Select the page you want to open and click Create.
 
 If you want to open a sample page, click the Page from Sample icon 
on the left side of the New Document dialog box. Choose Starter Page 
(Theme) from the Sample Folder column, Lodging — Home from the 
Starter page column (or any page that you think looks interesting), and 
click Create.
 
 Make sure that the page you select has text and images on it.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears. Dreamweaver wants to make sure that 
the page is saved immediately.
 
3. Type a name in the Save As text box.
 
 The location is routed automatically to the site folder that you created. 
See the “Creating a Site” section in this chapter to see how to create a 
site.
 
4. Click Save.
 
 The Copy Dependent Files dialog box appears. Dreamweaver even pro-
vides you with the image files.
 
5. Click Copy.
 
 Dreamweaver places the image files into your site folder, and the sample 
page appears.
 
6. After you have a document with text and images open, select various 
elements, such as an image, text, table, or hyperlink (linked text).
 
 With each selection, your Property inspector provides you with specific 
information about that element (refer to Figure 2-5).
 
The Property inspector is analogous to the Option bar, which appears at the 
top of the Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign workspaces, and the Property 
inspector in Flash. If you’re a former GoLive user, the concept of using the 
Property inspector is also very familiar to you because this same feature 
existed in that application as well.
Previewing Your Page in a Browser or with Live View
Perhaps you’ve completed your page and want to investigate how it looks on 
a browser. You can quickly preview your file by simply clicking the Preview/
Debug in Browser button on the Document toolbar and selecting the 
browser you want to preview your page in, as shown in Figure 2-6. You can 
also preview your page in Adobe’s Device Central, which simulates several 
different mobile and PDA devices.

You can always add browsers through the Preferences panel by 
choosing Dreamweaver➪Preferences➪Preview in Browser (Mac), or 
Edit➪Preferences➪Preview in Browser (Windows).
Previewing your page using Live View
Dreamweaver CS4’s new Live View displays your page as you would see it 
in a browser. This is a nice alternative to the Preview in Browser command 
because you don’t ever need to exit Dreamweaver.
To view your page in Live View, follow these steps:
 
1. With a page open in the Document window, click the Live View button 
on the Document toolbar.
 
2. To see the resulting source code of your page, click the Live Code 
button that appears next to the Live View button.
 
 This is equivalent to the View Page Source or View Source options avail-
able in most every browser. In this mode, you can only view the code, 
not edit it.
 
3. To edit your page code, switch to Split or Code view in the Document 
toolbar.

Understanding Dreamweaver Preferences
You can change many preferences in Dreamweaver CS4 (see Figure 2-7 for 
Mac OS X preferences). You see categories, such as General, Accessibility, 
and AP Elements, in the panel on the left, along with subcategories that 
appear in the panel to the right.
 
Figure 2-7: 
You can 
change 
numerous 
preferences 
to help you

To access general preferences, choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or 
Dreamweaver➪Preferences (Mac). The general rule for changing preferences 
is that if you don’t know what it means, don’t touch it. But if you want to 
tweak certain things, this is the place to go.
 
Preferences are especially helpful to those who hand-code and want to enter 
their own code hints, highlight colors, or change the font that appears in the 
Code view.

Chapter 3: Creating a Web Site
In This Chapter
✓ Creating a site
✓ Creating a page for your site
✓ Adding images to your pages
✓ Keeping track of your Web site files
✓ Discovering HTML
I
n this chapter, you discover the basics of putting a Web site together, 
from creating that first new, blank site, to adding files to Web sites, to 
playing (just a little bit) with HTML.
Web Site Basics
A Web site is a collection of related pages linked to one another, preferably 
in an organized manner. With the proper planning and an end goal in sight, 
you can easily accomplish the task of creating a great Web site. Figure 3-1 
shows the general structure of a Web site. Web sites start with a main page 
(or the home page), the central link to other pages in the site. The main page 
is also the page viewers see first when they type your URL in a browser. The 
main page is typically named index.html, but it may also be index.htm 
or even default.htm. Check with your provider to find the correct name.
Pages are linked together with hyperlinks, references that take viewers 
from one point in an HTML document to another or from one document to 
another. (Read more about hyperlinks and how to create them in Chapter 6 
of this minibook.)
 
Figure 3-1: 
A diagram 
of the 
structure of 
a Web site.
 

Starting a New Site
572
 
The following are terms that you should understand when you forge through 
the steps to create a Web site:
 
✦ TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): Underlying 
protocols that make communication between computers on the Internet 
possible. TCP/IP ensures that information being exchanged goes to the 
right place, in a form that can be used, and gets there intact.
 
✦ URL (Universal Resource Locator): A standard for specifying the loca-
tion of an object on the Internet, such as a file. The URL is what you 
type into a Web browser to visit a Web page, such as www.dummies.
com. URLs are also used in HTML documents (Web pages) to specify the 
target of a link, which is often another Web page.
 
✦ FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Allows a user on one computer to trans-
fer files to and from another computer over a TCP/IP network. FTP is 
also the client program the user executes to transfer files. You may use 
FTP to transfer Web pages, images, and other files to a host Web server 
when you publish your site.
 
✦ HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The client-server TCP/IP protocol 
used on the Internet for the exchange of HTML documents.
 
How Web sites are organized is important. Typically, the purpose of a 
Web site is to sell something — a product, a service, or a thought, such as 
“Vote for me!” Without sound organization, a Web site may fail to sell to its 
visitors. Read these words slowly: Plan your site. Seriously, you’ll save an 
extraordinary amount of time if you just think ahead and plan your site’s 
organization. Think about the topics you want to cover and then organize 
your site as you would a high school essay project, planning the topic sen-
tence, subtopics, and so on. This plan can be a tremendous aid when you 
start mapping which pages should be linked to others.
Starting a New Site
Even if you’re creating only one page, it’s best to create a site. A site gives 
you an organized method for keeping images and other assets together and 
offers additional options for management of those files.
To create a new site, follow these steps:
 
1. In Dreamweaver CS4, choose Site➪New Site.
 
 You could also choose Dreamweaver Site from the Create New column 
of the Welcome screen. The Site Definition dialog box appears. Make 
sure the Basic tab is selected.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Creating a Web Site
Starting a New Site
573
 
2. In the Site Name text box, enter a name for the site, and click Next.
 
 For example, if your site’s focus is on bikes, you might name the site 
biking.
 
 Because you’re creating a new page but not immediately uploading it, 
leave the HTTP address blank.
 
3. Select the No, I Do Not Want to Use Server Technology radio button 
and click Next.
 
 This step allows you to design a Web site on your computer and test it 
in various browsers without setting up complicated server information. 
If you’re actually using ASP, ColdFusion, and JSP, you can choose your 
server technology, but that path isn’t covered in this example.
 
4. Because you haven’t yet defined a server (where your pages will be 
accessible on the Internet), select the Edit Local Copies radio button.
 
 It’s best to leave this option selected, even if you do have a server set 
up, because you can keep originals intact on your computer until they’re 
ready to be uploaded.
 
5. Click the Browse Folder icon to the right of the File Path text box. 
As shown in Figure 3-2, browse to the location where you want to 
create the site folder that you’ll use to store all the site’s assets and 
click Next.
 
 If you already have a folder where you’ve saved your assets (such 
as images, .doc files, and media), choose this folder. Otherwise, 
Dreamweaver creates a new, empty one.
 
 The Sharing Files Site Definition dialog box appears.
 
6. Choose None from the Remote Server drop-down list and click Next.
 
 You can set up the server information later.
 
 The Summary window appears.
 
7. Review the information and, if you want to make changes, click the 
Back button; otherwise, click Done.
 
 You’ve created a local folder on your computer.
As soon as you create a site, your site folder is waiting in the Files panel, as 
shown in Figure 3-3. Think of the Files panel as the central control center for 
all your files, folders, and other assets, such as images, sound, and video, 
that you’ll use to create your Web site.
The Files panel allows you to view files and folders, whether they’re related 
to your Dreamweaver site or not. You can use the Files panel to do typical 
file operations, such as opening and moving your files.

Creating a New Page for Your Site
After you create a site, you typically build your main page, the index.html 
or index.htm page. index.html and index.htm are reserved filenames 
that are recognized by most every Web server as the starting page for a 
Web site. In addition, default.html and default.htm are also commonly 
recognized as starting pages. Check with your Web site hosting company 
or Internet service provider because in some instances, your server may 
require a different name or may prefer one naming convention over another.

Creating a Web Site
Adding an Image to Your Page
575
The following steps walk you through creating a new page and placing an 
image on it:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Page dialog box appears.
 
 You can create many types of new files, from blank pages to more 
advanced pages that include layouts already created in CSS.
 
2. To create a blank page, choose Blank Page➪HTML➪<none> and then 
click Create.
 
 A blank untitled HTML page appears.
 
3. Choose File➪Save.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears.
 
4. In the File Name text box, type index.html.
 
 Note that the file is already mapped to your site folder. If you don’t see 
the site’s root directory (the main folder where all the pages and assets 
are stored), click the Site Root button in the Save As dialog box to 
locate it.
 
5. Click Save.
Note that when you save a file, it appears in your Files panel.
Adding an Image to Your Page
After you have a blank page, you can add an image to it, including native 
Photoshop (PSD) files and Fireworks (PNG) images. You can find out more 
about images in Chapter 4 of this minibook, but in this section, you can take 
a look at how placing images affects your Files panel.
To place an image on a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Insert➪Image.
 
 
 Alternatively, click the Common tab of the Insert panel and click the 
Images button.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box appears.
 
2. Navigate to the location of your image and click Choose.
 
 If you choose a native Photoshop (PSD) or Fireworks (PNG) file, an 
Image Preview dialog box appears, allowing you to optimize your image 
right in Dreamweaver.

Adding an Image to Your Page
576
 
 If you select a Web-ready image, such as JPG, GIF, or PNG, and the image 
is outside your site folder, you see a warning. Dreamweaver alerts you 
that your image is outside the root folder, which causes issues when you 
copy your pages to a Web server. Click Yes to copy the file to your site’s 
root directory. Assign a new name here or just click Save to keep the 
same name and duplicate the image file into your site folder.
 
 The Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box appears.
 
 All images should have Alt (alternate) text — text that appears before the 
image has downloaded or that appears if the viewer has turned off the 
option to see images.
 
3. Add an appropriate description of the image in the Alternate Text 
text box.
 
 If the image is a logo, the description should include the company name 
as the Alt text, or if it’s a photo or illustration, describe the image in a 
few words.
 
 From an accessibility standpoint, Alt text aids screen readers (such as 
those used by the visually impaired) in identifying image content to 
users. In addition, Alt text is a valuable tool in providing search engines 
a way of indexing image content included on your site.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The image is added to the page and to the Files panel, as shown in 
Figure 3-4.
 
You can edit your image by double-clicking it in the Files panel. You can also 
use the Property inspector to see info about your image, including dimen-
sions and file size. From here, you can modify image properties, including 
border, hyperlink, and vertical/horizontal padding.
When you create a larger site with multiple pages linked to each other, you 
may want to change the view of the Files panel. By clicking the drop-down 
list (on the left side of the Files panel) where your site is located, you can 
locate folders and other sites that you’ve used recently. By clicking the 
View drop-down list to the right, you can change the appearance of the Files 
panel. See Figure 3-4 for an example of how a site appears in Local view.
 
Open your files from the Files panel by double-clicking them.

Naming Files
Get in the habit right away of naming your files and folders correctly. 
Follow these rules to make sure that links and pages appear when they’re 
supposed to:
 
✦ Use lowercase for all filenames. Using all lowercase letters in filenames 
is an easy way to ensure that you don’t have broken links because you 
couldn’t remember whether you initial-capped a filename. Some Web 
servers (such as those based on UNIX or Mac OS X) are very case-sen-
sitive. Although a Windows server may be more forgiving of case, you 
don’t want to count on that in the event that your files are moved to a 
different type of server.
 
✦ Don’t use spaces in filenames. If you need to separate words in a file-
name, use the underscore character instead of a space. For example, 
instead of file new.html, use file_new.html or even filenew.
html.

Managing Your Web Site Files
578
 
✦ Use only one dot, followed by the extension. Macintosh users are 
used to having no naming restrictions, so this rule can be the tough-
est to adhere to. Don’t name your files something like finally.done.
feb.9.jpg. That is B-A-D for the Internet. Examples of dot-extensions 
are as follows: .jpg, .gif, .png, .htm, .html, .cgi, .swf, and so on.
 
✦ Avoid odd characters. Characters to avoid include dashes (-) or forward 
slashes (/) at the beginning of the filename. These characters can mean 
other things to the Web server and will create errors on the site.
Managing Your Web Site Files
You can find out more about uploading your site in Chapter 9 of this 
minibook, but for now, understand that you can go back into your Site 
Definition dialog box at any time by choosing Site➪Manage Sites. The 
Manage Sites dialog box that appears offers options for editing, duplicating, 
removing, exporting, and importing sites. Click Edit to add an FTP server 
or change the name of your site, as well as change any of your original site 
definition settings.
Delving into HTML Basics
The Web page itself is a collection of text, images, links, and possibly media 
and scripts. The Web page can be as complex or simple as you want, both 
being equally effective if created properly. In this section, we show you how to 
create a page in Dreamweaver and then investigate the HTML that creates it.
To create a blank page, choose File➪New➪Blank Page➪HTML➪<none> and 
then click Create. A blank untitled HTML page appears. This blank page has 
no formatting until you add tables or layers (see Chapter 7 of this minibook). 
When you type on the page in the document, text appears on the Web page. 
But there’s much more to it than that; type some text (say, your name) on 
the page and click the Code button on the Document toolbar.
Dreamweaver’s working in the background to make sure that your page 
works in most all recent versions of common Web browsers, such as 
Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. Lots of code is created to help the Web 
browser recognize that this is HTML and which version of HTML it uses.
 
By default, Dreamweaver uses the XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard each 
time you create a new HTML page. XHTML combines the strictness of XML 
(Extensible Markup Language) with HTML tags to create a language that 
works dependably and consistently across Web browsers and new devices 
(such as cellphones and PDAs) alike.

Select the Split view by clicking the Split button on the Document toolbar; 
this displays both the Design and Code view simultaneously so you can see 
how your changes affect HTML behind the scenes. Select the text, click the 
Text tab in the Insert panel, and select B (for bold). The text turns bold. 
Click the Code button to switch back to the Split view, and you see that the 
<strong> tag was added before the text and the </strong> tag was added 
after the text, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Working in 
Split view 
helps you 
see how 
elements 
are 
formatted 
with HTML 
tags.
 
HTML code, though easy, is just like any other language, in that you must 
figure out the syntax (the proper sequence and formation of the code) and 
vocabulary (memorize lots of tags). You don’t have to have gobs of tape on 
your glasses to build good, clean Web pages, but you do have to review the 
following HTML basics.
 
If you’re an experienced user, you know that by copying and pasting code, 
you can figure out a lot about HTML code. If you’re a new user, copying and 
pasting code can help you understand what others have implemented on 
their pages and perhaps give you some ideas. Working in Split view also 
helps you understand how the items you add from the toolbars and panels 
translate into code.
In general, HTML tags are composed of three parts:
 
✦ Tag: The main part of the HTML information — for example, <strong> 
for strong or bold, <font> for the font tag, <table> for an HTML table, 
and so on. Tags always are constructed of a keyword enclosed in a set of 
brackets, such as <p>, or <blockquote>.

Delving into HTML Basics
580
 
 Most tags come in pairs, meaning that you must enter an opening tag 
(<p>) and a closing tag (</p>). In XHTML 1.0 Transitional (the standard 
used for all new pages created in Dreamweaver), all tags must be closed. 
You can either close a tag or create a self-closing tag by including the 
slash before the closing bracket like so: <br/>.
 
 For example, if you make text bold by adding the tag <b>, tell the 
text where to stop applying boldface by inserting a closing tag </b>. 
Otherwise, the text continues to appear bold throughout the remainder 
of the page.
 
✦ Attribute: An attribute gives you a way of further fine-tuning the appear-
ance of a specific HTML tag. Attributes are always added to an opening 
tag and can take different values to control color, size, the destination 
of a link, and so on. For example, bgcolor is an attribute of the <body> 
tag that specifies what color the background of the Web page should 
be. You’ll also see that many HTML tags share the same attributes: For 
instance, both the <body> and <table> tags can accept a bgcolor 
attribute.
 
 An example of a paragraph (<p>) tag with an attribute added:
<p align=”center”>This is centered text</p>
 
✦ Value: The actual color, size, destination of a link, and so on, specified in 
an attribute. For example, you can specify a hexadecimal number as the 
value for a color attribute. An example of a value for the bgcolor attri-
bute of the <body> tag (which controls overall page appearance) could 
be “red” or “#CC0000”.
One last thing: Nesting is the order in which your tags appear. If a <strong> 
tag is applied, it looks like this: <strong>This text is bold</strong>. 
Add an italic tag, and you have <strong><em>This text is bold and 
italic.</em></strong>. Notice the in-to-out placement of the tags; you 
work your way from the inside to the outside when closing tags.

P
lacing images that are interesting and informative is one of the 
most exciting parts of building a Web page. In this chapter, you dis-
cover how to insert and optimize native Photoshop (PSD) files directly in 
Dreamweaver, as well take care of basic needs, such as resizing, cropping, 
and positioning the image. You also find out how to create interesting back-
grounds and create easy rollovers.
 
If you plan on following along with some of the steps in this chapter, create 
a site or have a practice site open. Images are much-needed linked assets on 
your page. You don’t want to lose track of them in your filing system. If you 
don’t know how to create a site, read Chapter 3 of this minibook.
Creating Images for the Web
Placing images isn’t difficult, but you must consider which format images 
are saved in and how large the files are. (See Book IV, Chapter 10 for details 
on selecting the correct format and using the Save for Web & Devices fea-
ture in Photoshop.)
Putting images on a Web page requires planning to make sure that sizes 
are exactly what you want them to be. You also need to make sure that you 
don’t have too many images to keep the page loading quickly.
If you look in the lower right of your Document window, you see the page file 
size and its approximate download time. In Figure 4-1, the page file size is 26K, 
and the download time is 4 seconds. This download time is based upon the 
preference of 56K per second. You can change the download speed by choos-
ing Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences (Mac), select-
ing the Status Bar category, and clicking the Connection Speed drop-down list.

The jury is always out as to how fast a page should download, but less than 
15 seconds is a good target. Unless you have some really compelling con-
tent, you’ll probably lose viewers after that.
Putting Images on a Page
Putting your images on a Web page in Dreamweaver is easier than ever, 
mostly because of the integration with other Adobe products. You can use 
menu items, copy and paste, and even drag and drop images on to your 
Dreamweaver page. In the following sections, you not only find out how 
to place your images, but you also discover some general helpful tips that 
relate to putting graphics on the Web.
Inserting an image
If you’re preparing images ahead of time, save or move the optimized 
images into your site folder. It’s not that you can’t select an image from 
anywhere in your directory; it just adds another step, copying the image 
into your site folder.
After you have a page open, you can insert an image as follows:

Book VI
Chapter 4
Working with 
Images
Putting Images on a Page
583
 
1. Click to put your insertion point on the page where you want the 
image placed.
 
 2. Locate the Common tab on the Insert panel and click the Insert Image 
button or choose Insert➪Image.
 
 If image isn’t the default for your Insert Image button, click and hold 
the arrow to the right of the button and choose Image from the drop-
down list.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box appears.
 
3. Navigate to where your image is located and click OK (Windows) or 
Choose (Mac) to place the selected image.
 
 If your images are located in your site folder, you can click the Site Root 
button shown on the Select Image Source dialog box to navigate there 
quickly. If your image isn’t in your site folder, you see an alert dialog 
box, asking whether you want to copy the file there now.
 
4. If you’re prompted to copy the image to your site’s root folder, click 
Yes, and in the Copy File As dialog box that appears, verify that the 
name is correct and click Save.
 
 You now see the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box, request-
ing that you enter Alt text. (For more on Alt text, see the sidebar “Gotta 
have that Alt text.”)
 
5. Type a word or two that best describes your image (such as Our Family 
Photo) in the Alternate Text text box and click OK.
 
 The image is placed.
Dragging and dropping an image
In addition to the Image object found in the Insert panel, if your Files panel 
is visible within the workspace, you can click and drag images directly to 
the page from the Files panel onto the page. If you’re dragging an image, the 
cursor follows you while you move around the document until you release 
the mouse button and drop the image.
If you’re taking advantage of the Adobe Bridge workflow, you can leave 
Bridge running and drag images as you need them right from the Bridge 
window into your Dreamweaver page. You can access Bridge by choosing 
File➪Browse in Bridge.
If the image is a native Photoshop (PSD) or Fireworks (PNG) file, the Image 
Preview dialog box appears, giving you the opportunity to optimize the 
image before placing it.
You can also drag and drop an optimized image from your desktop or other 
folders right into a Dreamweaver page. If they’re not in your site folder, you 
get the opportunity to copy the image to your site folder.

Getting to Know the Property Inspector
584
Getting to Know the Property Inspector
Many of the tools you use when working with images are located on the 
Property inspector (see Figure 4-2).
 
Figure 4-2: 
The 
Property 
inspector’s 
image-
editing 
options.
 
You can choose from these properties when an image is selected:
 
 
✦ Editing the original: If you want to make a quick change, it shouldn’t 
have to involve a lot of navigating through the directories on your oper-
ating system. To edit your original image file, select it and click the Edit 
in Photoshop button on the Property inspector. The image is launched 
in Photoshop, where you can make changes and re-save the image.
You’ve probably seen Alt text a gazillion times; 
it’s the text that appears before an image when 
a Web page is loading. Alt text also appears as 
a ToolTip when you hover your mouse cursor 
over an image in a Web page.
Alt text is helpful because it tells viewers 
something about the image before the image 
appears, but Alt text also is necessary for view-
ers who turn off their preference for viewing 
graphics (such as in certain e-mail applica-
tions), or for folks using a Web-reading program 
like those for the visually impaired. U.S. federal 
regulations also require Alt tags for any work 
completed for federal agencies. These tags 
are also helpful for people with slow Internet 
connections.
In addition, Alt text is a valuable tool for index-
ing image content for search engines: Search 
engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, all 
utilize Alt text as a key method of indexing images 
for their respective image search listings.
To assign or change Alt text to an image that’s 
been placed already, type your descriptive 
copy in the Alt text box located in the Property 
inspector.
Gotta have that Alt text

 You can select the default image editing application for different 
image file types with the Preferences➪Files Types/Editors. By default, 
Photoshop CS4 and Fireworks CS4 are the primary or secondary editors 
for most any image type.
 
✦ Optimizing an image: You do have the opportunity to optimize images 
right off your Dreamweaver page, but this method doesn’t provide quite 
the same capabilities that you have when placing a native Photoshop 
or Fireworks file because the image you’re selecting has already been 
optimized. It may already be a JPEG or GIF — and yes, you can reduce 
the number of colors in the GIF or change a JPEG to a GIF, but you really 
can’t increase color levels or quality on these images, as they’re not 
linked to the original image file.
 
✦ Cropping an image: This feature is sure to become a favorite because 
you can make cropping decisions right on your Dreamweaver page. 
Simply click the Crop tool, acknowledge the warning message telling you 
that you’re editing the image, and then click and drag the handles to the 
desired size. Press the Enter key, and you’re done!
 
✦ Resampling an image: You may have heard that you shouldn’t resize 
an image placed on a Dreamweaver page because, if you were making 
the image larger, it would become pixilated, and if you were making the 
image smaller, you were wasting lots of bandwidth downloading the 
file. Fortunately, you can now use the Resample button on the Property 
inspector after you resize the image. Just keep in mind that making the 
image larger still causes some quality issues, so it’s best to reduce the file 
size before choosing the Resample button. If you need to make an image 
considerably larger, find the original and optimize it to the proper size.
 
 To resize an image, you can either click and drag out the lower-right 
corner handle of the image or type a pixel value in the W (Width) and H 
(Height) text boxes in the Property inspector.
 
✦ Brightness and contrast: If high quality is important to you, open your 
original image in Photoshop and make tonal corrections with professional 
digital imaging tools. If volume and quickly getting lots of images and pages 
posted is important, take advantage of the Brightness and Contrast con-
trols built right into Adobe Dreamweaver. Simply click the Brightness and 
Contrast button in the Property inspector, acknowledge the Dreamweaver 
dialog box, and adjust the sliders to create the best image.
 
✦ Sharpen: Add crispness to your image by applying the Sharpness con-
trols available in Dreamweaver. Just like some of the other image-editing 
features in Dreamweaver, you’re better off using the Unsharp mask filter 
in Photoshop, but in a pinch, this feature is a great quick tool to take 
advantage of. To use the Sharpening feature, click the Sharpen button, 
acknowledge the warning that you’re changing the image, and use the 
slider to sharpen the image.

Placing Photoshop Files
586
Placing Photoshop Files
If you’ve created artwork or prepared images in Photoshop, you can place 
your original PSD files directly into your pages. The Image Preview window 
lets you save your Photoshop files into Web-ready image formats, such as 
PNG, GIF, and JPEG, as well as scale and crop your artwork before it’s placed 
on the page.
Photoshop Smart Objects
The ability to work with Photoshop files is great for most designers who 
depend on Photoshop as part of their workflow. Now, when you place 
Photoshop files on a page, Dreamweaver creates a Smart Object — an image 
that maintains a connection to the original Photoshop file from which it was 
created.
The image now displays an icon that lets you know if the original file was 
updated, and you can apply the changes in the original file to the image in 
one click.
To place a Photoshop file in your page:
 
1. Click where you want to place the new image and then click the Image 
object in the Insert panel’s Common category.
 
2. When the Select Image Source dialog box appears, browse and select 
a Photoshop PSD file and then click Choose/Select to select the image.
 
3. The Image Preview dialog box appears, where you can optimize, crop, 
scale, and save your image in the Web-friendly JPEG, GIF, or PNG for-
mats, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
4. In the Options tab, select the file format you want to save your image 
in from the Format drop-down list, and choose the quality settings that 
best suit your image from the Quality drop-down list.
 
 You can use the Saved Settings drop-down list at the top of the dialog 
box to choose one of the image quality presets.
 
5. (Optional) Click the File tab to switch to the File options and then 
enter settings to scale your image or use the Crop tool at the bottom of 
the preview window to crop your image.
 
6. Click OK to save the image.
 
7. When the Save Web image dialog box appears, navigate to your site’s 
root folder and click OK to save the image into the appropriate folder 
(for instance, your default images folder).

 If the Image Tab Accessibility Attributes dialog box appears, type a 
short description of your image in the Alternate text field and click OK 
to place the image.
 
 The new image is placed, and a small icon appears in the upper-right 
corner of the image. This Smart Object indicator shows two green 
arrows, indicating that your image is up to date.
 
Figure 4-3: 
The Image 
Preview 
dialog box 
lets you 
optimize 
and save a 
Web-ready 
image from

file.
 
Select the image you just placed in the preceding steps list and locate the 
Original text field on the Property inspector — this displays the location of 
the original Photoshop file. To edit the image, you can simply click the Edit 
in Photoshop button on the right side of the Property inspector to open the 
source file in Photoshop.
Updating Photoshop Smart Objects
If you make any changes to the original Photoshop file, the image you placed 
in your page displays a red and green arrow icon to let you know that it’s not 
up to date.
 
 To update a Smart Object when you see this indicator, as shown in Figure 
4-4, select the image and click the Update from Original button on the 
Property inspector to apply the new changes to the placed image.

Aligning an Image
588
 
Figure 4-4: 
The original

Moving the original PSD file connected to a page image displays an alert 
icon on the image and disables the link between the two. Keep your origi-
nal PSD files in a set location and make sure to revise the location of your 
source file by selecting the image and updating the original in the Property 
inspector.
Aligning an Image
As a default, images and any adjacent text sit on the same baseline, forcing 
text to run in one line off to the right of the image. To control the wrapping/
runaround of the text, change the alignment of the image by selecting the 
image and then choosing an option from the Align drop-down list in the 
Property inspector.
The Align drop-down list provides the following options:
 
✦ Default: Uses Baseline alignment (described next).
 
✦ Baseline (Default): Aligns the bottom of the image with the baseline of 
the current line of text.
 
✦ Top: Image aligns itself with the top of the tallest item in the line of text.
 
✦ Middle: Image aligns the baseline of the current line of text with the 
middle of the image.
 
✦ Bottom: Baseline aligns the bottom of the image with the baseline of the 
current line of text.
 
✦ Text Top: Image aligns itself with the top of the tallest text in the line. 
This is usually (but not always) the same as ALIGN=top.
 
✦ Absolute Middle: Aligns the middle of the current line with the middle 
of the image.
 
✦ Absolute Bottom: Aligns the bottom of the image with the bottom of the 
current line of text.
 
✦ Left: Aligns the image to the left, text flushes to the right of the image.
 
✦ Right: Aligns image to the right, text flushes to the left of the image.

Using an Image as a Background
589
Adding Space around the Image
You may want some space around the image to keep the text from butting 
right up to the image. To create a space around the image, enter values into 
the H Space and V Space text fields in the Property inspector.
 
If you want space added only to one side of the image, CSS (Cascading Style 
Sheets) provides the ability to add margins to one side of an image only. See 
Chapter 5 of this minibook for more on using CSS to format text and page 
elements.
In addition, you can open the image in Photoshop and choose Image➪Canvas 
Size. In the Canvas Size dialog box that appears, click the middle-left square 
in the Anchor section and add a value in pixels to your total image size. Click 
the right-middle square to add the size to the left side of the image.
Using an Image as a Background
Creating backgrounds for Web pages is fun and can be pursued in more 
ways than most people think. You can create a repeating pattern with a 
single small image, create a watermark, or use a large image to fill an entire 
background. As a default, HTML backgrounds repeat the selected image until 
the entire screen is filled. In conjunction with CSS properties, you can con-
trol or eliminate repeating behavior, and even set precise positioning for a 
single background image.
If you’re filling your background with a pattern, make sure that you create 
a pattern image that has no discernable edges. (In Photoshop, choose 
Filter➪Texture➪Texturizer to see some good choices in the Texturizer 
dialog box.)
To utilize the default, repeated tiling for a background image to your advan-
tage, follow these steps:
 
1. In Photoshop, choose File➪New to create a new image.
 
2. In the New dialog box that appears, create an image that’s much wider 
than it is high, choose RGB, choose 72 dpi, and then click OK.
 
 For example, enter 1000 in the Height text field and 20 in the Width 
text field.
 
3. Select a foreground and background color to create a blend; then with 
the Gradient tool, Shift+drag from the top to bottom of the image area 
to create a gradient fill.

4. Choose File➪Save for Web and save the image as a JPEG into your 
site’s Web content folder and then close the image.
 
 See Book IV, Chapter 10 for more about the Save for Web & Devices feature.
 
5. In Dreamweaver, choose Modify➪Page Properties or click the Page 
Properties button on the Property inspector to place the image as a 
background image in your Web page.
 
 If the Page Properties button isn’t visible, click the page, making sure 
that you don’t select another element, such as an image.
 
6. In the Page Properties dialog box that appears, click the Browse 
button to the right of the background image, navigate to the location 
of your saved background image, and then click Choose; click OK in 
the Page Properties dialog box.
 
 The image appears in the background, repeating and creating a cool 
background gradient across the page!
Depending on the size and resolution of a user’s monitor, your background 
image may be forced to repeat, as shown in Figure 4-5. This can be used in 
many creative ways as demonstrated in the text earlier.
 
In certain cases, you may not see your background until you click the Preview/
Debug in Browser button and preview the page in your default browser.

Creating Rollovers
With Dreamweaver, you can insert image objects. These image objects 
include image placeholders, rollover images (images that change when 
a viewer crosses over the image), navigation bars, and Fireworks HTML. 
Access these image objects by choosing Image➪Image Objects.
To create a rollover image, follow these steps:
 
1. Create the images that’ll be used as the rollover.
 
 You can generate these images with Illustrator, Photoshop, Fireworks, 
or any application capable of saving images optimized for the Web.
 
 2. Put your cursor on the page where you want the rollover to appear 
and choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Rollover Image, or click the 
Rollover Image button in the Insert panel.
 
 The Insert Rollover Image dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-6, appears.
 
3. Type an image name without spaces in the Image name text box.
 
 This name is used in the script creating the rollover.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Rollovers 
are made 
easy in 
Dream-
weaver.
 
 
4. Click the Browse buttons to the right of Original Image and Rollover 
Image text boxes to locate the image that you want to appear as a 
default on the page and the image that will appear only when some-
one mouses over the image.
 
5. Leave the Preload Rollover Image check box selected.
 
 This option downloads the rollover image when the page is downloaded 
to avoid delays in rollovers.
 
6. Type the appropriate descriptive Alt text in the Alternate text text box.

Inserting Media Content
592
 
7. In the When Clicked, Go to URL text box, instruct Dreamweaver as to 
where viewers are directed when they click your rollover image.
 
 You can either click the Browse button to locate another page in your 
site or enter a URL.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 The rollover image is created on your page.
 
9. To preview your new rollover image, choose File➪Preview in Browser 
or select the Live View button on the Document toolbar.
 
If you don’t have a real link to use for a button or hyperlink just yet, you can 
enter a pound sign (#) to create a dead link. The link or button appears click-
able but won’t go anywhere when clicked. This is a better option than creat-
ing a white space for a link, as that generates a Page Not Found error when 
clicked.
Inserting Media Content
Make your pages more interactive and interesting by adding Flash and 
Shockwave content. Dreamweaver makes it simple by providing you with 
the tools that you need to add Flash animation, FlashPaper, Flash Text, Flash 
Button, and Flash video (.flv) files.
Follow these steps to place a Flash file on to your Dreamweaver page:
 
1. Put the cursor on your page where you want to insert the Flash file.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Media➪SWF.
 
 The Select File dialog box appears.
 
3. Navigate to the SWF file that you want to place and click OK 
(Windows) or Choose (Mac) to select the file.
 
4. In the Object Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box, type a descrip-
tive title for the movie in the Title field and click OK.
 
 The Flash file is placed on the page.
 
5. On the Property inspector, click the Play button to preview your new 
Flash movie.
 
 You can also adjust settings for your movie, as shown in Figure 4-7.

Chapter 5: Putting Text 
on the Page
In This Chapter
✓ Adding text to your page
✓ Choosing and editing fonts
✓ Understanding CSS
✓ Creating an external style sheet
A
dding text to your Web page requires more than just typing on a page. 
You must carefully plan your Web pages so that search engines (and 
viewers) can easily find relevant content on your Web site. In this chapter, 
you discover fundamentals of text formatting for your Web pages, from the 
basics of font size and font family, to spell checking your text, to implement-
ing Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
Because you can assign type properties quickly and update several 
instances in a few easy steps with CSS, CSS is viewed as the most efficient 
and preferred method of applying text attributes on a Web page. When 
you create text for the body of your page, include keywords that provide 
descriptions of your site’s content. This makes your page more relevant to 
the search engine and the viewer.
 
As a default, Dreamweaver formats all text on your page with CSS, which 
is the standard for formatting a styling text. In previous versions of 
Dreamweaver, you still had the option to enable and use archaic <font> 
tags to format text if you so chose; this option has been removed from the 
CS4 preferences. Now, formatting with font tags can only be done by manu-
ally inserting <font> tags by choosing Insert➪Tag or by hand-coding meth-
ods. By default, when you format text directly from the Property inspector, 
CSS styles are always created to save and apply the formatting you choose.
Adding Text
To add text to your Web page, simply click the page wherever you want the 
text to appear; an insertion point appears where you can start typing. You 
can add text right to the page, in a CSS layer, or in the cell of a table.

Adding Text
596
Formatting text
Formatting text in Dreamweaver can be as simple as formatting text in any a 
word-processing application or applications such as InDesign or Illustrator. 
By using the Property inspector, you can easily apply basic font attributes, 
such as color, typeface, size, and alignment options. Clicking the Text cat-
egory of the Insert panel gives you several different HTML text tags to apply 
to your selected text (see Figure 5-1).
 
Figure 5-1: 
You can 
use the Text 
category of 
the Insert 
panel to do 
basic text 
formatting.
 
Most of the options in the Text category are apparent, but here’s a break-
down of some text tags that may be unfamiliar to you. To use these tags, 
simply select the text that you want the tag to be applied to and then click 
the tag on the Insert panel:
 
✦ Bold: Bolds text
 
✦ Italic: Italicizes text
 
✦ Strong: Bolds text
 
✦ Emphasis: Indicates emphasis, looks like italic
 
Dreamweaver favors the accessibility friendly <strong> and <em> tags 
over <b> and <i>, although both bold and italicize text, respectively, 
<strong> and <em>, are used in almost all cases, even when you click the 
B and I buttons.
 
When you press the Enter or Return key, a <p> tag is created automatically 
in the HTML source code. This tag may create more space than you like 
between lines and create new list items. Pressing Shift+Enter (Windows) or 
Shift+Return (Mac) creates a <br> tag, which is essentially a line break or 
soft return. See Figure 5-2.

Using the Property inspector to style text
Use the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 5-3, to apply HTML tags and 
build CSS classes to format text color, face, size, and more. The Property 
inspector is divided into two views: HTML and CSS. You can toggle between 
these two different views with the buttons on the left side of the panel.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Change text 
attributes.
 Click to toggle between HTML and CSS properties.
Here’s what all the buttons on the Property inspector mean:
 
✦ Format (HTML): Use the Format drop-down list to apply HTML tags 
that format an entire paragraph. This includes heading tags (Heading 
1–Heading 6) that are generally applied to headers and titles, the para-
graph tag, and the preformatted text tag. You can easily fine-tune each 
of these tags’ attributes (color, size, font family, and so on) later by 
using CSS.
 
 Note that Heading 1 is the largest format size (on average, about equiva-
lent to 24-point text), and Heading 6 is the smallest. This makes sense if 
you think about how these tags were originally used to create technical 
documents and outlines on the Internet, where text contained in Heading 
1 should be treated as more important than text in Headings 2 or 3.
 
 The last choice in the Format drop-down list is Preformatted. 
Sometimes, you want the browser to display text exactly the way you 
composed it — with indents, line breaks, and extra spaces. You can line 
up text this way if you choose Preformatted; it’s not pretty, but for down 
and dirty lists and columns, it can work well.

Adding Text
598
 
✦ ID (HTML): This applies a CSS ID style to an element. IDs are a specific 
type of CSS rule (or selector) that are used to store formatting informa-
tion that’s unique to a single item on the page (for instance, positioning 
information for a container).
 
✦ Class (HTML): This drop-down list applies an existing class style to a 
selection on the page. Class styles can be created with the Property 
inspector (discussed later in this chapter) or directly from the CSS 
styles panel. Note: This drop-down list was labeled Style in previous ver-
sions of Dreamweaver.
 
✦ Link (HTML): Type a hyperlink (such as www.wiley.com) or click the 
folder icon to browse and link to another page within your Web site. The 
selected text becomes linked (preview your page in a browser or enable 
Live View to see this work).
 
✦ Target (HTML): Choose where the linked target will appear. (Read about 
targets in Chapter 6 of this minibook.)
 
✦ Bold (HTML/CSS): Bolds your selected text.
 
✦ Italic (HTML/CSS): Italicizes your text.
 
✦ Alignment (CSS): You can click the alignment buttons on the toolbar to 
apply left, center, and right alignment. To revert to the default left align-
ment, click the currently selected alignment button again.
 
✦ Unordered List (HTML): Automatically puts bullets in front of the listed 
items. As you advance in the use of Cascading Style Sheets, you can 
apply many more attributes to lists, including customizing the bullets.
 
✦ Ordered List (HTML): Automatically numbers each additional line of 
text every time you press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac) key. To 
force the text to another line without adding the automatic numbering, 
press Shift+Enter (Windows) or Shift+Return (Mac).
 
✦ Text Outdent (HTML): Undo an Indent with the Text Outdent button. This 
removes the <blockquote> tag that the Text Indent button creates.
 
✦ Text Indent (HTML): Use to indent your text. Simply put your cursor in 
the paragraph of text that you want to indent and press the Text Indent 
button. A <blockquote> tag is applied. You can apply this tag multiple 
times to a paragraph to indent it further and further.
 
✦ Targeted Rule (CSS): This allows you to modify an existing CSS rule or 
create a new one; in previous versions of Dreamweaver, this was vague 
as to whether changes made to an existing CSS class would modify it or 
create a new one. This drop-down list lets you be very clear as to what 
your actions on the Property inspector will actually do.
 
✦ Edit Rule / CSS Panel buttons (CSS): For the rule shown in the Targeted 
Rule drop-down list, you can either edit the properties and values for 
that rule in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box or view it in the CSS Styles 
panel on the right, respectively.

Book VI
Chapter 5

599
 
✦ Font (CSS): Use this drop-down list to select a font family. The font is the 
typeface that you choose to display your text in. The lack of typeface 
selection isn’t a restriction in Dreamweaver, but rather in Web design as 
a whole. Keep in mind that what font the viewer sees on your Web page 
is based upon the availability of the fonts on that user’s computer. For 
this reason, font sets are limited to basic system fonts that are installed 
on most every computer, regardless of operating system.
 
 The viewer may not have fonts that you load in your font sets, so 
try to stick to common typefaces like the ones already included in 
Dreamweaver’s existing font sets.
 
✦ Size (CSS): With the Font Size drop-down list, you can apply a fixed font 
size from 9–36 (pixels) or enter a value by typing it directly in. You can 
use the relative sizes shown (x-small, small, and so on), which resize the 
font relatively larger or smaller according to the user’s browser prefer-
ences for font size. If you don’t change the font size, it defaults to 12 
pixels (px). By default, the unit of measurement is set to pixels, but you 
can use the neighboring drop-down list to set other units of measure-
ment including points, picas, ems, and more.
 
 Keep in mind that the user can set his browser preferences to override 
the size settings you’ve chosen.
 
✦ Color (CSS): Assign a color to your selection by clicking the swatch icon 
and selecting a swatch from the panel that appears. Colors are represented 
in HTML and CSS by hexadecimal codes, 6-character codes that represent 
the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values that form that color. This code is shown 
at the top of the Swatches panel whenever you select a color.
Spell checking your text
You can spell check just the file that you have open or multiple files by 
choosing Commands➪Check Spelling. With the Check Spelling dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 5-4, you can choose to add words to your personal diction-
ary, ignore words, or change the spelling of words.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Make sure 
that your 
spelling is 
correct.
 

Understanding Cascading Style Sheets

Understanding Cascading Style Sheets
Using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is definitely the cleanest and most effi-
cient method for stylizing text on your Web pages, and is the method that 
Dreamweaver uses. Style sheets are a powerful design tool that allows you 
to assign properties to type and other page elements quickly and update 
all instances in a few easy steps. The reason for the name Cascading Style 
Sheets is because certain cascading rules apply when several styles (and 
style sheets) are used at once.
If you apply many different styles to a page, whether they’re internally 
built on the page or linked to external style sheets, you may have conflicts. 
Conflicts occur when two (or more) styles assign different properties to 
the same element. For example, if you specify in an internal style sheet that 
anything bolded is blue but an external style sheet instructs the browser 
When a viewer opens a page referencing a 
font set, the text is displayed using the first 
available font in the font family. If the first font 
face on the list isn’t available, the next font face 
is referenced, continuing down the list in the 
font family until a font in the font set is found on 
the viewer’s computer. If you choose Edit Font 
List from the Font drop-down list, the Edit Font 
List dialog box appears (see figure).
Assigning and editing fonts
Click the existing font lists to see which fonts 
are included in each set. You can add new 
fonts to the sets by clicking the double arrow 
pointing from the Available Fonts panel into the 
Chosen Fonts panel. Delete a font from an exist-
ing font list by clicking the font in the Chosen 
Fonts panel and clicking the double arrow 
pointing toward the Available Fonts panel. You 
can even create an entirely new list yourself by 
clicking the + (plus sign) in the upper left of the 
Edit Font List dialog box.

to display anything bolded as red, which style wins? The blue instruc-
tion from the internal style sheet wins. If conflicts occur in external style 
sheets, you can set the order of importance by using the up and down 
arrows. By default, the Web page’s style sheet overrides the browser’s 
default values.
 
Keep in mind that style sheets are compatible with most all modern browser 
versions, but some older browsers may not provide consistent (if any) sup-
port for CSS. Always preview your pages in multiple browsers or use the 
Check Browser Compatibility button (located under the Check Page list on 
the Document toolbar) to test CSS properties you’ve used against a variety 
of browsers and versions.
We definitely offer the quick-and-dirty course on CSS here. If you’re inter-
ested in finding out more about this topic, check out CSS Web Design For 
Dummies by Richard Mansfield (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 
Dreamweaver CS4 uses Cascading Styles Sheets (CSS) exclusively to format 
text and no longer provides direct support for <font> tags. You can still 
add <font> tags if you absolutely need to by choosing Insert➪Tag.
Dreamweaver offers CSS starter pages that have CSS layouts available and 
that include CSS hints visible only in the Code view (see Figure 5-5). Find the 
CSS starter pages by choosing File➪New➪Blank Page➪HTML Template.
 
Figure 5-5: 
Helpful CSS 
tips are built 
into the 
CSS starter 
pages.
 
Using CSS for text
Using Cascading Style Sheets in Dreamweaver is very intuitive; simply create 
a blank HTML page, add and select some text, and begin styling your selec-
tion directly in the Property inspector CSS view by selecting properties for 
color, size, typeface, and more.

Understanding Cascading Style Sheets
602
Assigning formatting to a selection opens the New CSS Rule Dialog box, 
allowing you to save the choices you’ve made into a new CSS rule (or style). 
You can choose a name, selector type, and a location for the new rule.
Several types of selectors determine what style properties should be applied 
and where. When Dreamweaver finds a selector, it applies the properties 
and values you’ve chosen. This means you make formatting choices once 
and reapply them over and over in a single click!
(You can find out how to take advantage of advanced properties for creating 
layouts in Chapter 8 of this minibook.)
Creating a new tag style
Creating a tag (or an element) selector is a simple and safe route for new 
users to understand CSS because you can work with existing HTML tags, 
such as H1, H2, and so on. With existing element tags on your page, you 
can choose to apply automatic formatting wherever existing HTML tags are 
used. For instance, you can make anything inside a <strong> tag automati-
cally italic, 20 px, and red.
To create a tag style with the Property inspector, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an HTML page that contains text.
 
2. On the Property inspector, click the CSS button on the left of the panel 
to display the Property inspector in CSS view.
 
3. Locate the Targeted Rule drop-down list and make sure it’s set to 
<New CSS Rule>.
 
4. Select some text on the page and assign the <strong> tag by clicking 
the B button.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
 
5. Use the color selector on the right side of the panel (located below the 
B and I buttons) to select a new color for any text appearing inside the 
<strong> tag (bold text).
 
6. From the Selector Type drop-down list, choose Tag (Redefines an 
HTML Element); choose Strong from the Selector Name drop-down 
list; choose (This Document Only) from the Rule Definition drop-
down list.
 
 See Figure 5-7. The selector type determines how the formatting will be 
applied to elements on the page. Tag styles change the appearance of 
any element formatted with a specific HTML tag.
 
7. Click OK to create the new tag style and exit the panel.

Figure 5-6:

 By choosing to define the style in this document only, it inserts the CSS 
rule in the head section of this page only. The <strong> tag would be 
adjusted to your definition only on this page. This can be beneficial if 
you have one page in your site that’s black, for example, and you want 
the <strong> tag to be white for that one page only.

 Here are a few things to keep in mind as you choose your attributes:
 
• Font family: Notice that you can apply a font family with the Font 
drop-down list. This is the preferred method of assigning a font 
family.
 
• Font size: Enter a text size and then, with the Unit drop-down list to 
the right of the size, enter it as pixels, points, inches, centimeters, 
and other units of measurement. By specifying a size and unit of 
measurement here — 12 px, for example — you can be assured that 
the text appears as relatively the same size on both the Windows and 
Macintosh platforms.
 
• Line height: By assigning a size in any unit, you can define the space 
between lines of text. For example, if the type size is 12, the line 
height of 24 px is essentially the same as double-spacing. If you come 
from the typesetting or design world, it works much like leading.
 
• Font decoration: Hmm, if you want it, get it here! Blinking isn’t a good 
idea, as it is just plain B-A-D and also not compatible on all browsers. 
Try and use underlines to make key text stand out, or use underlines 
to create a line underneath paragraph or page headers.
 
 Don’t like underlines under your links? Create a tag style for the <a> 
tag (this is the HTML tag used to create a link) and select None in the 
Decoration drop-down list.
 
• Font-Weight: Make your text lighter or heavier with this drop-down 
list. Just so you know, a value of 700 is the typical boldness of bold 
text; any heavier is bolder than bold.
 
• Font-Variant: Use this drop-down list to choose small caps.
 
 You may be wondering why Normal is a choice in the Style drop-
down list. Normal is choice because you may have defined small 
caps, for example, as the variant for all instances of the <strong> 
tag, but then decided that on one page you wanted to override that 
attribute. By creating a style defined in the document only with 
Normal selected in variant, you can override the style (small caps) 
definition on the external style sheet.
 
• Font transform: Choose from Capitalize, Uppercase, Lowercase, or 
None.
 
• Color: Assign a color to your selector by clicking the arrow in the 
lower-right corner of the Color definition swatch or type a number in 
the Color text box.
 
8. Click Apply.

Creating a new class style
For more styling control over your page, you can create class selectors, 
which are named styles for body, text, headlines, subheads, and so on. 
Unlike tag selectors, you can choose just about any name for a class and 
apply its style selectively to items if and when you want.
If you choose properties that work on a variety of elements, you can get a 
lot of mileage from a single class style in many places throughout your page. 
Essentially, class styles are like creating your own character or paragraph 
styles, if you’re familiar with that feature from common page-layout applica-
tions, such as InDesign.
This time, you can also make your new rule available to more than one page 
in your site by defining a new external style sheet. This saves your rules in 
an external file which can be attached to several pages at once.
Follow these steps to create a class style from the CSS Styles panel:
 
1. Locate your CSS panel, off to the right, and click the New CSS Rule 
button at the bottom or choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box appears (refer to Figure 5-6).
 
2. From the Selector Type drop-down list, choose Class (Can Apply to 
Any HTML Element).
 
3. In the Selector Name text box, enter a name to your new class.
You may find that when you assign certain 
properties, you see varying results because 
some properties that you select affect only 
block level elements as compared to inline 
elements. Block level elements apply to ele-
ments that take up their own horizontal space 
on a page, such as an entire paragraph or 
an ordered/unordered list. If you create a P 
element style and change the line spacing, 
the space takes effect within the block-level 
element.
An inline element is one that applies formatting 
to tags or items that fall within the flow with 
text, such as the <strong> tag. If you choose 
to apply line spacing to the b element, the lead-
ing in paragraphs that contain the <strong> 
tag aren’t affected.
You’ll eventually figure out which properties 
work with which tags. Just keep this point in 
mind so that you’re not dumbfounded when 
some properties don’t work as expected!
Block level versus inline

 You can enter any name that you want but make sure that it has no 
spaces and is descriptive of how you’ll use it. Reallycoolstyle is a bad 
name; headlinestyle is a better name. Dreamweaver inserts the period 
at the front of the style name as it’s a necessary naming convention.
 
4. From the Rule Definition drop-down list at the bottom, choose (New 
Stylesheet File).
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The Save Style Sheet File As dialog box appears. Locate your site folder 
(or if you haven’t defined a site, a folder where you’ll keep all relevant 
information, such as image files and pages for your site).
 
6. Enter a name for your style sheet.
 
 Enter something appropriate, such as main.css or basic.css if it’s the 
main set of styles you’re creating for your Web site. (Make sure to 
include the .css extension at the end of the name.)
 
7. Leave the URL as is and the Relative To drop-down list set to 
Document.
 
8. Click Save.
 
 You’ve now created a new .css file, or external stylesheet. The CSS Rule 
Definition dialog box appears.
 
 In this dialog box, you can create the set of attributes that you want 
included in the CSS definition for the style you’re creating. As you might 
notice, this dialog box is the same definition that you work with when 
you create a tag style (see the previous section). The difference with the 
tag and class styles is really only in the application of the style.
 
9. Apply a font, size, style, line height (leading), and any other attributes 
that you couldn’t apply to text using straight HTML coding.
 
10. After you select attributes for your class style, click OK to exit the 
dialog box and return to your page.
Now you can apply the CSS class style to some text. When applying a class 
style, you can choose to apply it to only some text or to an entire paragraph 
of text. Follow these steps to apply a class style to an entire paragraph:
 
1. Place your cursor into a paragraph of text or click and drag to select a 
line of text.
 
2. If the Property inspector isn’t visible, choose Window➪Properties. 
Click the HTML button on the left side of the Property inspector to 
toggle to HTML view.
 
3. From the Class drop-down list shown in the Property inspector HTML

Chapter 6: Linking It Together
In This Chapter
✓ Using internal links
✓ Discovering how to use anchors
✓ Linking to external documents, e-mail, and PDFs
✓ Making sure that your links work
L
inks are a major and necessary component of any Web site. You must 
incorporate links on your Web site; this way your viewers can easily 
navigate throughout your site to get the information they’re seeking. In 
this chapter, we show you how to add links easily and effectively with 
Dreamweaver.
The Basics of Linking
Links (also referred to as hyperlinks) are navigational aids; viewers click links 
to go to other Web pages, a downloadable resource file, an e-mail address, or 
a specific spot on a Web page (known as an anchor). As you create the first 
link from one of your Web pages to another, you’ve essentially created a Web 
site — it may be a small site, but it’s a start. While you’re still in the small site 
stage, here are a couple of things we recommend that you keep in mind as 
you add more pages and create more links, making your site ever bigger:
 
✦ Essentially, there are two kinds of links: internal and external. Internal 
links connect viewers to other parts of your Web site; external links con-
nect viewers to other pages or content outside your site. We show you 
how to create each kind of link in this chapter.
 
✦ Before you start working with any pages that are to be linked, make sure 
that you’ve created a Dreamweaver site; this helps you locate local files 
to link to, and later you’ll have the ability to check and validate links 
between pages in your site.
Implementing Internal Links
Internal links, an essential part of any user-friendly site, help your viewers 
easily and quickly navigate to other parts of your Web site.

Implementing Internal Links
610
 
If you need to change names of files after they’ve been linked anywhere, do 
so only within the Files panel in Dreamweaver. Otherwise, you’ll end up with 
broken links. Take a look at the “Resolving Link Errors” section, later in this 
chapter, to find out how to change the names of linked files without breaking 
the links.
You can create a link out of text or an image (such as a button graphic). The 
following sections outline several methods that you can use for creating links.
Using the Hyperlink dialog box to create a link
To create a hyperlink with text as the link, you can use the Hyperlink command:
 
 1. Select some text, make sure that the Common category of the Insert 
panel is forward, and click the Hyperlink button.
 
 The Hyperlink dialog box appears with your selected text already 
entered in the Text field, as shown in Figure 6-1. (You can also choose 
Insert➪Hyperlink.)
 
Figure 6-1: 
Create a 
link from 
selected 
text with the 
Hyperlink 
button.
 
 
2. You can either enter a URL (or location of a file) or click the Browse 
folder icon to the right of the Link drop-down list and browse to the 
file you want to link to.
 
 You can also enter an external link here; see how to link to external loca-
tions a little later in the “Linking to Pages and Files Outside Your Web 
Site” section.
 
3a. If you want the page to appear in the same Document window, essen-
tially replacing the existing page, leave the Target drop-down list 
blank or choose _self.
 
3b. If you want to force the link to create its own Document window, 
choose _blank.
 
4. Click OK to create your link.

Creating Anchors
611
Using the Property inspector to create a link
You can link text and images with the Property inspector HTML view.
 
1. Select the element on your page that you want to link up.
 
2. With your text or image selected, select the HTML button on the left of 
the Property inspector to switch to HTML view and then type the link 
location into the Link text box.
 
3. To locate the destination file, click the Browse folder icon to the right 
of the Point to File button.
 
 The Select File dialog box opens.
 
4. Navigate to the folder containing the file you want to link to, select it, 
and click OK (Windows) or Choose (Mac).
Creating hyperlinks with Point to File
In a hurry and want a more visual way of linking up your pages? You’ll love 
this quick method for creating hyperlinks:
 
1. Select the text you want to use as a link on your page.
 
 2. On the Property inspector, find the Point to File icon located next to 
the Link field; click and drag it and pull toward the Files panel — an 
arrow follows you.
 
3. Move the arrow pointer over the file in the Files panel that you want 
to link to and release the mouse button (see Figure 6-2).
 
 Voilá! The connection is made, the filename appears in the Hyperlink 
text box, and the selection is now hyperlinked to your selected file.
Creating Anchors
Anchors are a link to a specific section of a page, either on the same page as 
the link or on another page entirely. Anchors are especially handy for long 
pages that have a lot of text. You’ve probably seen and used anchors, for 
example, when clicking a Back to Top button or when navigating within a 
page using a Table of Contents. Anchors are extremely helpful to the viewer 
and should be implemented whenever possible.

Creating Anchors
612
 
Figure 6-2: 
Creating a 
hyperlink 
with the 
Property 
inspector.
 
To create an anchor in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert your cursor where you want the destination to be for your link.
 
 The anchor may be placed before a line of text or on its own line.
 
2. Click the Named Anchor button in the Common category of the Insert 
panel.
 
 The Named Anchor dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-3, appears.
 
 You can avoid clicking the Anchor button by using the keyboard short-
cut Ctrl+Alt+A (Windows) or Ô+Option+A (Mac).
 
3. Type a short name that’s relevant to what the link is connected to.
 
 In Figure 6-3, you see that top was entered because this anchor returns 
the viewer back to the top of the page. Keep the name all lowercase, as 
anchors are case sensitive.
 
4. Click OK.
You’ve now created the anchor but have no links directed to it yet. You 
can define an anchor as a link manually or by using the Point to File tool, as 
described in the following two sections.

Book VI
Chapter 6

Linking to an anchor manually
Here’s one reason why a short, appropriate name is useful for anchors: You 
may end up having to type it! By manually linking to an anchor, you can link 
within the page you’re working on or direct the link to an anchor on a com-
pletely different page.
You can manually define an anchor as a link by following these steps:
 
1. Select the text that’s to be the link.
 
2. If the Property inspector isn’t open, choose Window➪Properties.
 
3. Select the text you want to link to your new named anchor and click 
the Hyperlink button located on the Insert panel.
 
4. In the Hyperlink dialog box, locate the Link field and click the drop-
down list directly next to it.
 
 Your named anchor appears as a selection, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
5. Select your anchor to apply it and then click OK.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Select the 
anchor 
name in the 
Hyperlink 
dialog box.
 
You can also link to a page and add an anchor reference to it with the 
Property inspector. For example, if you wanted to link to this spot from 
another page, you’d select an element on that page and in the Link text box 
(in HTML view), type the name of the page, a pound sign (#), and the name 
of the anchor — for example, type birds.html#canary. This directs the 
browser to the birds page and then to the canary anchor within that page.

Linking to Pages and Files Outside Your Web Site
614
Frequently, you see anchors separated by the pipe sign (|). You can create 
this type character by pressing Shift+\. The backslash key is directly above 
the Enter (Windows) or the Return (Mac) key.
Linking to anchors with Point to File
You can use the same cool Point to File icon you used earlier to create 
hyperlinks for creating anchors. The Point to File icon on the Property 
inspector can also target anchors you’ve created on your page.
 
1. Select the text you want to use as a link on your page.
 
 2. On the Property inspector, find the Point to File icon located next to 
the Link field, click and drag over it, and release the arrow directly 
over an anchor icon on your page.
 
 The text is now linked to the anchor, and the anchor’s name appears in 
the Property inspector’s Link text field preceded by a pound sign (such 
as #canary).
Linking to Pages and Files Outside Your Web Site
You can link to pages anywhere, in your site or out. An internal link (some-
times referred to as a relative URL) is one within your site. The link to 
another page in your site may appear as contact.html in your Link text 
box in the Property inspector. But if you’re directing people to a contact 
page posted on another site, you’d have a link that looks more like http://
www.aquent.com/contact. By typing the http:// and the address of 
the external link (sometimes referred to as an absolute URL) in the Property 
inspector, you’re essentially directing the browser to a site out on the 
Internet and away from your site.
 
It’s essential to include the http:// prefix before a Web address — omitting 
this results in a Page Not Found error in your browser. This is because the 
browser may interpret www.aquent.com as a local filename rather than an 
outside Web address.
Linking to E-Mail
Linking to an e-mail address opens a new mail message on the viewer’s com-
puter that’s already addressed to the e-mail address you specify in the link. 
(This, of course, requires that the viewer has set up an e-mail program on 
his or her machine.)
Linking to an e-mail address is easy and extremely helpful if you want to 
give your users an easy way to contact someone through your Web site. To 
create an e-mail link, follow these steps:

Book VI
Chapter 6
Linking It Together
Resolving Link Errors
615
 
1. Select the element that will be the link to an e-mail.
 
 It can be text or an image.
 
2. In the Property inspector, locate the Link text box and type mailto:
(address), and then press Enter/Return.
 
 For example, type mailto:info@agitraining.com and press the Enter or 
Return key. The mailto: directive tells the browser that the link is to 
an e-mail address so that the default e-mail application on the user’s 
computer opens with a new, pre-addressed message.
Linking to a PDF File
To link to a PDF file instead of a Web page, you link to the name and location 
of the PDF file. If you link to a PDF file and the Acrobat PDF plug-in is loaded 
in the viewer’s browser, the PDF is opened in the browser window. If the 
viewer doesn’t have the Acrobat plug-in (free from www.adobe.com), the 
Save dialog box appears, and the viewer can browse to save the file to open 
with Acrobat Reader at another time.
Resolving Link Errors
Page names can change and pages can be deleted (intentionally or not), so 
periodically checking for broken links is a good idea. You can check to make 
sure that links are working correctly in several ways. The most cumbersome 
is previewing your page and clicking each and every link. This method would 
take you a long time and wouldn’t be much fun. To check your local links 
more efficiently and quickly, try the following:
 
1. Choose Site➪Check Links Sitewide.
 
 The Results panel appears, with the Link Checker tab active.
 
 Any links appear, including page, scripts, images, and so on, as shown in 
Figure 6-5.
 
2. Use the Show drop-down list in the top-left corner to sort the link 
results by Broken Links, External Links, or Orphaned Files.
 
 To focus only on broken links, leave Broken Links selected.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Check to 
make sure 
that your 
links aren’t 
broken.
 

Resolving Link Errors
616
 
 If you don’t have broken links . . . congratulations! If you do, you can 
fix them right in the Results panel. The page that has the broken link is 
listed in the Files column on the left. The broken link appears under the 
Broken Link column on the right.
 
3. Click the name of the broken link and correct the filename, if it’s a 
problem, or click the Browse folder icon to locate the correct location 
or file.
 
4. Click OK (Windows) or Choose (Mac).
 
 The broken link is repaired.
 
Orphaned files are pages, images, or any other assets that aren’t linked to 
anything else within your site. Although these aren’t necessarily a problem, 
take a glance at any orphaned files by selecting Orphaned Files from the Link 
Checker tab Show menu. Make sure no pages are unlinked that shouldn’t be.

Chapter 7: Creating Tables
In This Chapter
✓ Creating tables
✓ Manipulating rows, columns, and cells
✓ Selecting tables and cells
✓ Changing colors of a table or cells
✓ Adding and importing your content
T
ables are great for presenting data, such as schedules and pricing, and 
can be helpful in instances where you’re trying to arrange elements in a 
tabular format.
In this chapter, you find out how to create a table and make changes that 
alter the look of the table. Tables are also used as an alternate method for 
creating page layouts.
Working with Tables
When you think of a table, think of a grid that has multiple cells in it, much 
like a spreadsheet. Tables are used in HTML pages so that elements can be 
contained and positioned within specific cells. You can change the colors 
of cells in tables, divide or span the cells (that is, combine them with other 
cells), and apply borders to them.
In some cases, you don’t actually see the table itself because you can place 
content into row and column form without showing the table itself; in this 
case, the table is just a formatting tool. When you create a table, you can 
determine how many rows and columns it contains. You can also choose to 
span rows and columns to create unique tables, as shown in Figure 7-1.
To create a table in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
 1. Put your cursor where you want the table to appear, make sure that 
the Common tab of the Insert panel is visible, and then click the 
Table button.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Table. Whatever method you use, 
the Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.

cations in

dialog box.
 
 
2. Enter or select the attributes of the table that you want to create:
 
• Rows: Enter how many rows you want in your table in the Rows text 
box. Rows stack vertically and can be added or deleted after you 
create the table.

Book VI
Chapter 7
Creating Tables
Working with Tables
619
 
• Columns: Enter how many columns you want in your table in the 
Columns text box. Columns are created horizontally across your 
table and can be added or deleted after you create the table.
 
• Table width: Enter the desired width in the Table Width text box and 
then select a measurement (Pixels or Percent) from the drop-down 
list to the right. Table width is an important attribute because it sets 
the default size for the table. If you leave this set to 100 percent, the 
table will take up 100 percent of your Web page, dynamically expand-
ing and reducing in size when the page is resized. You can change 
the width to a different percentage, such as 50 percent, to have the 
table take up half the width of your Web page, or enter a pixel value 
to assure that the table always stays the same size.
 
• Border thickness: Enter the thickness you want for the width of the 
border (in pixels) surrounding the cells and outside the table. If 
you don’t want to see the table formatting, type 0 in the Border 
Thickness text box. Note: In Design view, you still see dashed table 
borders — this is only a visual aid. You see the actual borders when 
you view the page in a browser or in Live View.
 
• Cell padding: Enter a number in the Cell Padding text box if you want 
to use padding to create a margin around all contents inside the cell.
 
• Cell spacing: Enter a number in the Cell Spacing text box if you want 
to change the spacing to push cells apart.
 
• Header: Select the type of header you want to include in your table 
(or select None if you don’t want any headers). Including headers 
is important, especially if you’re creating a table containing data to 
assist viewers in associating the header with the data. Screen read-
ers rely on headers to help visually-impaired users navigate through 
the table without getting lost.
 
• Accessibility: You can provide some additional information to help 
visually-impaired users understand the contents of your table. Add 
a caption that’s relevant to your table in the Caption text box. In the 
Summary area, include several lines of text to provide more informa-
tion about the purpose of the table.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 Your table’s created.
 
When working with tables, it may help to take advantage of the Expanded 
table feature in Dreamweaver. (Find the Expanded button on the Layout 
category of the Insert panel.) The Expanded view adds cell padding and 
spacing in a table, as well as increases the size of the border to make selec-
tion easier. It’s important to return to the Standard view (click the Standard 
button in the Layout category of the Insert panel) after you’re finished edit-
ing for the most accurate preview.

Working with Tables
620
Editing your table’s attributes
Even if you’ve already created your table, you can go back and edit the 
table’s attributes by selecting the table and entering changes in the Property 
inspector, as shown in Figure 7-3.
If your Property inspector isn’t expanded, as in Figure 7-3, click the arrow in 
the lower right of the inspector. The inspector then expands, offering addi-
tional options.
 
When a table is selected, you can use the handles that appear in the lower-
right corner as well as the bottom and left sides to resize the table manually.
Adding and deleting rows and columns
You can add rows and columns as well as delete them as fast as your client’s 
(or boss’s) needs require with the Property inspector, but the Modify menu 
gives you a little more control as to which rows and columns are deleted and 
where new ones are added.

To add a row, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert your cursor in a cell in the row that you want a new row added 
above or below.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Table Objects➪Insert Row Above or Insert Row Below.
 
 Alternatively, press Shift+M.
 
 The new row appears.
 
If you want to add more rows to the bottom of the table, place your cursor in 
the last current row and press the Tab key to add rows.
Follow these steps to delete a row:
 
1. Insert your cursor in a cell of the row you want to delete.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Table➪Delete Row.
 
 Alternatively, press Shift+Ctrl+M (Windows) or Shift+Ô+M (Mac).
 
 The row is deleted.
To add a column, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert your cursor in a cell.
 
 Insert your cursor in the cell in the column that you want a new column 
added to the left or right of.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Table Objects➪Insert Column to the Left or Insert 
Column to the Right.
 
 The new column appears.
Follow these steps to delete a column:
 
1. Insert your cursor in a cell of the column you want to delete.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Table➪Delete Column.
 
 Alternatively, press Shift+Ctrl+– (minus) (Windows) or Shift+Ô+– 
(minus) (Mac).
 
 The column is deleted.
Spanning or merging cells
Often, you need to span or merge cells. You can combine cells with other 
cells horizontally or vertically. By merging cells, you can create more inter-
esting and useful tables. Figure 7-4 contains a table with one large merged 
cell across the top.

Working with Tables

Follow these steps to merge cells in a row or column:
 
1. Double-click a cell to select it, and then drag across to select contigu-
ous cells in the row or drag down to select contiguous cells in the 
column.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Table➪Merge Cells.
 
 The cells are merged.
If you want to split a merged cell back to into separate cells, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Put your cursor in the merged cell or column.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Table➪Split Cell.
 
 The Split Cell dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.

3. Choose whether you want to split into rows or columns by selecting 
either the Rows or Columns radio button.
 
4. Enter how many rows or columns you want to create by splitting the 
cell in the Number of Rows/Columns text box.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The merged cell is now split into the number of cells you specified.

Selecting a Table and a Cell
623
Selecting a Table and a Cell
You can use several methods to select a cell or the whole table. After a cell 
or table is selected, you can change all sorts of attributes for the selected 
cell or table, including color, size, and format of its contents.
To select a table or cell, follow these steps:
 
1. In Design view, select the Layout category from the Insert panel and 
select Expanded to put your table in the Expanded view.
 
 It’s easier to select and make changes in this view. (Remember to click 
the Standard button to get a more realistic preview of what your table 
will look like.)
 
2. Select a cell by Ctrl-clicking (Windows) or Ô-clicking (Mac) it.
 
Another option is to use the tag selector in the lower-left corner of your 
Document window, as shown in Figure 7-6. The tag selector is an incredible 
tool to use to select any tag element, but it’s especially helpful when select-
ing individual components of a table or a nested table.
To use the tag selector, just put your cursor inside a cell. The tag selec-
tor shows the tags that apply to where the insertion point is. Then select 
<td> to select the cell that the cursor is in, <tr> to select the entire row, or 
<table> to select the entire table.
 
The tag for table is <table> (a difficult one to remember, right?), and each 
row is in a <tr> tag, which stands for Table Row. Each cell is in a <td> 
(Table Data) tag. Tables created with a header also make use of the <th> 
(Table Header) tag.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Use the tag 
selector to 
select cells 
and tables.
 

Changing the Color of Table Cells
624
Changing the Color of Table Cells
You can change colors of a single cell, multiple cells, or an entire row in 
Dreamweaver. You can use either standard HTML attributes or use CSS rules 
to apply color to any portion of a table, but the easiest way is to use the 
Property inspector to assign a background color.
To change the color of cell or multiple cells in a table:
 
1. Ctrl-click (Windows) or Ô-click (Mac) anywhere within a cell to select 
that cell.
 
 You can continue to add cells to your selection by keeping the key 
pressed and clicking more cells.
 
2. In the Property inspector, make sure the HTML view is selected (click 
the HTML tab on the left edge of the panel), and locate the Bg Color 
Picker.
 
3. Assign color to a cell(s) using one of the following methods.
 
• Click the swatch to the right of Bg and select a color from the Color 
Picker that appears. Remember that you can choose from additional 
color models by clicking the palette menu in the upper right of the 
Color Picker.
 
• If you know the hexadecimal number for your color, you can type it 
in the text field next to the Bg color swatch.
 
• Select a color from any element that you can see on the screen by 
clicking and holding the color fill box to the right of Bg and then 
moving the Eyedropper tool over any color on your screen that you 
want the cell color to pick up. Click when the color appears in the 
Color Picker preview window.
 
4. The color is applied as a background to the selected cell(s).
In addition to using the Property inspector, you can include background 
color settings in a new CSS rule and apply them to an entire table, cell, or 
row with the Property inspector.
You can add a color to a cell or table using CSS by following these steps:
 
1. Create a CSS rule from either the Property inspector or the CSS styles 
panel (as discussed in Chapter 5 of this minibook).
 
2. Under the Background category in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, 
assign a color to the Background color property.
 
3. Apply the style by selecting the table or cell you want to modify.
 
4. Assign a class by using the Class drop-down list on the Property 
inspector.

Adding and Importing Content
625
Adding and Importing Content
Adding content to a table is easy — insert your cursor into the cell and type 
directly into a cell for text or click Image in the Common category of the 
Insert panel to insert an image in a cell. You can also cut, copy, and paste 
content from documents and other Web pages directly into table cells.
Importing CSV and tab-delimited files
If you already have spreadsheet style data in text form it’s not necessary 
to retype it into a Dreamweaver table. Dreamweaver has an incredibly easy 
feature that you can use to bring in tabular data as a formatted table: Import 
Tabular Data.
CSV (comma separated values) and tab-delimited files are plain text files 
that can be generated from a number of popular programs such as Microsoft 
Excel. This allows you to save spreadsheet data in a way that can be 
exchanged with other applications such as Dreamweaver.
In CSV files, columns are noted by commas between values, and each line 
return indicates a new row. In tab-delimited files, a tab between values indi-
cates a new column, and a line return forces a new row. To import tabular 
data, follow these steps:
 
1. Put your cursor on the page where you want the table created.
 
2. Choose File➪Import➪Tabular Data.
 
 The Import Tabular Data dialog box appears.
 
3. Browse to the location of a comma separated values (.csv) file or a 
tab-delimited (.txt) plain text file with the Browse button.
 
4. Verify or select the delimiter that your file uses.
 
 Typically, the delimiter (where a new column will be created) is a 
comma or tab; however, you can also instruct Dreamweaver to create a 
new column from other delimiters, such as Comma, Semicolon, Colon, or 
other options, by using the Delimited drop-down list.
 
5. Determine the table width.
 
 You can choose to have the table automatically sized to fit the data by 
leaving the Fit to Data radio button selected, or you can enter a number 
in the Set To text box to set a percent or pixel value.
 
6. Enter numbers in the Padding, Spacing, and Border text boxes and 
specify top row formatting with the Format Top Row drop-down list at 
the bottom of the dialog box.
 
7. When you’re finished with these settings, click OK.
 
 Your table’s created!

Adding and Importing Content
626
 
You can export table data from Dreamweaver just as easily by selecting a 
table and choosing File➪Export➪Table. When the Export Table dialog box 
appears, choose what you want the delimiter to be and the type of line break. 
Click Export, determine where you want to save the file, and click Save.
Setting alignment for table cells
As a default, all elements center vertically inside a cell and are flush left. 
Change this on a cell-by-cell basis by selecting the cell(s) and then changing 
the Horz (horizontal) and Vert (vertical) alignment in the Property inspector.
 
Make sure the Property inspector is fully expanded to see the Horz and Vert 
drop-down lists.
If you select every cell in a row, you also have the opportunity to change the 
alignment of an entire row. In the Property inspector, you’ll find a horizon-
tal alignment drop-down list that changes the alignment for an entire row 
or selected cell. Choose from Left (default), Center, or Right. Note that any 
changes you make in the individual cell alignment override the row alignment.
You can also change the vertical alignment in the Property inspector when 
you have a row selected. Click the Vert drop-down list and choose Default, 
Top, Middle Bottom, or Baseline.
 
To select an entire row at once, position your cursor on the left side of the 
row you want to select. When the black arrow appears, simply click. You 
can also use this method for selecting an entire column by positioning your

C
reating a page layout sometimes requires more precision than what 
tables or standard HTML tags are capable of. More designers are 
moving to the flexible and preferred method of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
positioning to create innovative layouts without boundaries. Dreamweaver 
provides you with an extensive gallery of CSS-based layouts to get started, 
or you can build your own using the Insert panel’s Layout tools, including 
the Insert DIV and AP Div objects.
Using CSS Starter Pages
Dreamweaver provides you with a library of sample pages with CSS-based 
layouts as an alternative to starting from scratch. These CSS sample pages 
feature useful and common layout ideas, and because they’re created with 
CSS positioning, they’re highly flexible. You can modify them directly from 
the CSS Styles panel or the Property inspector. Just add your content and go!
Follow these steps to create a new document from a CSS sample page:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document panel appears.
 
2. Choose Blank Page from the left, select a layout from the Layout 
column on the right (for example, the 2 Column Elastic, Left Sidebar, 
Header and Footer layout), and click Create.
 
 A new untitled page opens based on the layout you chose.
 
3. Choose File➪Save to name and save the document.
 
4. Replace the placeholder text in each column with your own content.

Modifying a New Layout
628
Modifying a New Layout
As the name indicates, CSS layouts are controlled completely by style sheet 
rules, so you can modify the look and feel of the page directly from the CSS 
Styles panel and the Property inspector. Each column, box, and space on 
your new page is positioned and sized using CSS rules and properties, all of 
which you can adjust from either the Property inspector (on the CSS Styles 
panel) or the CSS Rule Definition panel.
You can modify the layout by following these steps:
 
1. If not already open, choose Window➪CSS Styles to open the CSS 
Styles panel.
 
2. Select the All tab to display the style sheet and its rules.
 
 The internal style sheet is shown as <style> at the top. Click the arrow 
to its left to expand it and show all the rules it contains. Note: Layouts 
using an attached (external) style sheet will display the style sheet name 
(such as styles.css) instead of the <style> tag.
 
3. Select the body rule.
 
 This tag-based style controls the general formatting of the entire page 
(everything inside the <body> tag).
 
4. Click the field next to the background rule to edit it; instead of 
#666666 (medium gray), type a hexadecimal color (such as #CC0000 
for red) to change your page’s background color.
 
5. Click the swatch next to the color rule to open the Swatches panel; 
pick a new default type color for the text on your page.
 
6. At the top of the CSS Styles panel, select another style (for example, 
the .twoColElstHdr #container style) to view its properties.
 
 The .twoColHybLtHdr #container style is an ID style that controls 
the size and appearance of the main layout container on your page.
 
7. In the Property inspector, edit the properties to change the appear-
ance of the style.
 
 For example, you can change the width of the rule by entering a new 
number in the Width Rule text box. If you enter 95%, for example, you 
make the entire layout wider.
Each column and section that composes your layout is controlled by one of 
the ID styles listed in the CSS Styles panel. Most every ID style features a width 
property that you can use to change the size of different areas on the page.
Continue to modify different styles listed in the CSS Styles panel and see how 
they affect different elements on your page. Try changing type color, font 
family, and other properties, such as padding and background color.

Creating AP Divs

To figure out exactly which ID controls which column or section, click within 
the page area and look at the tag selector at the bottom of the Document 
window. The last <div> tag at the end of the chain shows you which con-
tainer you’re currently in and its corresponding ID in the CSS Styles panel 
(for example, <div#mainBox>).
Creating AP Divs
Dreamweaver uses CSS-positioned virtual containers, or boxes, created by 
the DIV tag to freely position content on a page. DIV tags are a basic tag 
used to create areas for content on your page. You can create DIV tags 
from several places in Dreamweaver, including the Layout category of the 
Insert panel. Each DIV tag can have a unique ID style assigned to it to con-
trol its position, appearance, and size. The process of placing content often 
requires two steps: creating the DIV tag and then creating its corresponding 
style.
Dreamweaver makes this task easy with the AP Div tool, which enables you 
to draw boxes freely on the page and place your content inside.
 
AP Div is short for absolute-positioned DIV; an item with an absolute position 
means that it’s fixed at a specific location on the page. When you draw an AP 
Div, its position is commonly set using the top and left CSS properties, with 
the top-left corner of the page as its reference point.
 
For those of you who have used much earlier versions of Dreamweaver, you 
may remember Dreamweaver layers. The AP Div object replaced the Layer 
object as of version CS3, and the AP Elements panel now replaces the Layers 
panel.
CSS treats every element on a page as a box that holds content; this 
approach is referred to as the CSS Box model. Although CSS can consider 
most any containing element on a page (such as a table or a list) a box, DIV 
tags are most commonly used to create virtual boxes that you can use to 
position text, images, and even other boxes.
Each box can have its own width, height, position (via the top and left prop-
erties), border, margins, and padding; each one is set using CSS rules.
To create AP Divs, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Insert panel, select the Layout category.
 
2. Click the Draw AP Div object.
 
 Your cursor appears as a cross hair when you move it back over the page.
 
3. Click anywhere on the page and drag to draw a new AP Div, as shown 
in Figure 8-1; release the mouse button.

Figure 8-1: 
Click and 
drag on the

4. Move the mouse pointer over the edge of the box until it changes to a 
hand; click once and handles appear on all sides.
 
5. Click and drag any of these handles to resize the box vertically or 
horizontally.
 
6. To move the box, click and drag it by the tab that sits on its top-left 
edge and place the box where you want it on the page.
 
 Take a look at the Property inspector, and you see the name as well as 
many of the DIV’s properties listed.
 
7. If the CSS Styles panel isn’t open, choose Window➪CSS Styles to open 
it; under the All panel, click to the left of the style sheet (<style>) to 
expand it.
 
 You see a new #apDiv1 ID style that’s attached to the new AP Div you 
created. For each new DIV created, Dreamweaver assigns apDiv with a 
corresponding number in order of creation.
 
8. Click inside the new box to type, paste, or insert new content.
When you draw an AP Div on the page, two things occur: Dreamweaver 
inserts a tag to create the box and creates an ID selector that stores the 
DIV’s position, width, height, and other properties. After you create an AP 
Div, you can type, paste, or insert content directly inside it. You can also 

Book VI
Chapter 8
Creating CSS 
Layouts
Creating AP Divs
631
assign a class rule to any DIV from the Property inspector — this is most 
often for handling content formatting, leaving the ID selector to control posi-
tioning and dimensions.
Each AP Div that you draw is listed automatically in the AP Elements panel 
(choose Window➪AP Elements to display it). The AP Elements panel can 
help you select, hide, and show any AP Divs on the page. This panel is handy 
when you have lots of AP Divs on the page and want to navigate among them 
accurately. Most of all, because you can modify the properties for any AP 
Div from its corresponding ID style, the panel helps you figure out which ID 
style belongs to an AP Div.
 
The AP Elements panel is often grouped with the CSS Styles panel, just in 
case you’re looking for it!
To modify a box (AP Div), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪AP Elements to open the AP Elements panel.
 
2. In the panel, locate and select apDiv1 to highlight it on the page, as 
shown in Figure 8-2.
 
 The Property inspector displays its size and position in addition to other 
properties.
 
3. With the text boxes on the Property inspector, change the box’s width 
by entering a number into the W field and change its height by enter 
a number in the H field.
 
4. Click the swatch next to Bg Color and choose a color from the pop-up 
Swatches panel to set a background color for the box.
 
 For additional properties, such as border or padding, add them in the 
CSS Styles panel.
 
5. If the CSS Styles panel isn’t already visible, open it by choosing 
Window➪CSS Styles.
 
6. Double-click the #apDiv1 ID style that controls the box.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
7. Select the Border category from the left to change the border.
 
8. In the Style column, use the Top drop-down list to set a border style 
(such as Solid) to all four sides.
 
 Use the Top drop-down list under the Width category to select a border 
thickness (for example, medium) for all four sides. Use the topmost 
Color Picker under the Color column to assign a border color to all four 
sides.
 
 To assign different values to any or all sides for style, width, or color, 
deselect the Same for All check box under their respective columns.

9. In the Box category on the left, under Padding, set the padding for all 
four sides of the box to the desired thickness (for example, enter 10 px 
in the text boxes).
 
10. Click OK to exit the panel and apply the changes.
 
 You see how the CSS properties you applied affect the apDiv1 box on 
the page.

Creating Relatively Positioned DIVs
633
 
To hide a box shown under the AP Elements panel, click the column to the 
left of its name (under the Eye icon) until a closed Eye icon appears. To 
make the box re-appear, click the Eye icon until the box opens again.
 
You may notice the Prevent Overlaps check box at the top of the AP 
Elements panel. Because AP Divs can easily overlap each other, selecting 
this check box overrides that behavior by forcing boxes next to each other 
and preventing the creation of new boxes on top of each other. Because this 
is usually a desired effect, the check box is deselected by default.
Creating Relatively Positioned DIVs
The precision and to-the-pixel positioning of AP Divs can be very liberating 
for designers, especially those who desire the flexibility of print-based lay-
outs. However, on certain occasions, you may want boxes to flow inline with 
other content on the page. AP Divs literally float above other elements, so 
shifting other page content has no effect on their position.
For more traditional inline behavior, you can create DIVs that use relative 
positioning. Relative positioning allows an element to be shifted along with 
content surrounding it, making for a more liquid layout. This is important 
for nested content or any situation where you need items to fall in line with 
other page content. For this task, use the Insert Div Tag tool, which can be 
found within the Insert panel’s Common and Layout categories.
Follow these steps to create a relatively positioned DIV:
 
1. Click within the body of your page to position your cursor and then 
click the Insert Div Tag tool under the Insert panel’s Common and 
Layout categories.
 
2. When the Insert Div Tag dialog box appears, fine-tune the location of 
your new DIV by selecting a location from the Insert drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 (For example, choose After Start of Tag to place it after a specific tag in 
your page.)
 
 You can also place the DIV before, after, or inside existing elements 
on the page using this menu. Leave the Insert drop-down list set to At 
Insertion Point to leave the box where you drew it or choose another 
location where you want the DIV created.
 
3. If you have an existing class selector you want to apply, choose it from 
the Class drop-down list; otherwise, leave it blank.

634
 
Figure 8-4: 
Choose a 
specific 
location to

4. Assign an ID selector to the DIV to control its appearance by selecting 
from the ID drop-down list.
 
 If one isn’t available, enter a new name and click the New CSS Rule 
button to create one. When the New CSS Rule dialog box appears, make 
sure your new selector is set to ID and that the name has a pound sign 
(#) in front of it. Click OK.
 
5. When the CSS Rule Definition dialog box appears, click and select 
Positioning from the Category list on the left to view CSS positioning 
properties.
 
6. Under Positioning, select Relative from the Position menu, enter a 
width and height value in the Width and Height text boxes, and then 
click OK.
 
7. Click OK to exit the Insert Div Tag dialog box.
 
 A new relatively positioned DIV appears with placeholder text, as shown 
in Figure 8-5.

Using Behaviors with Boxes
635
Using Behaviors with Boxes
To add cool effects and serious interactivity, you can use Dreamweaver’s 
built-in behaviors, a collection of ready-to-use scripts that you can apply to 
boxes, form elements, text, and images on your page. When used with boxes 
(AP Divs), behaviors can enhance them with special effects or mouse inter-
action (such as clicks and rollovers) to make your page more exciting.
The Behaviors panel features a whole new set of effects, such as Fade/
Appear, Shrink, Highlight, Slide, and more — all of which you can apply to 
the AP Divs that you create.
You can add behaviors by following these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Behaviors to open the Behaviors panel.
 
2. Select a box using the AP Elements panel or select it directly on the 
stage.
 
3. In the Behaviors panel, click the plus sign.
 
 The menu of available behaviors appears.
 
4. From the menu, choose the behavior you want to apply.
 
 For example, to apply a fade effect, choose Effects➪Appear/Fade, as 
shown in Figure 8-6.
 
 The Appear/Fade dialog box appears.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Add a cool 
Appear/
Fade effect 
to a DIV on 
your page.
 
 
5. Make sure the effect is set to Fade and click the Toggle Effect check box 
to make sure that the box reappears when it’s clicked a second time.
 
 The behavior is added to the list. The phrase onClick to its left indicates 
this action occurs when the box is clicked.

Using Behaviors with Boxes
636
 
6. Choose File➪Save to save the page.
 
 To see the effect in action, preview the page in a browser.
 
7. Choose File➪Preview in Browser and pick a browser to launch the 
page in.
When you test the page, clicking the box makes it disappear or reappear — 
lots of fun for you and highly interactive for your user!
 
If your browser is restricting the Web page from running scripts or ActiveX 
controls, click the message at the top of your browser window and select 
Allow Blocked Content to properly test the new behaviors.
 
When effects behaviors are used, Dreamweaver needs to copy several files 
to your local site that make the effects possible.

W
hen you’re ready to launch your Web site, you can take lots of steps 
to ensure that your site looks and works great. Dreamweaver’s tools 
and reports streamline the process of testing and fixing any problems so 
that you can present your visitors with a great first impression.
Clean Up after Yourself!
The first step toward getting your Web site ready for the world is making 
sure everything works and all your files are in order. Dreamweaver is 
packed full of tools that let you know exactly what’s broken, what can be 
done better, and how your site will perform across a spectrum of different 
browsers.
One of the key benefits of a Dreamweaver site is its ability to see relation-
ships between your various pages and files and detect any broken links 
or missing images before you copy the site up for public viewing. Choose 
Files➪Check Links Sitewide to comb your entire site to find broken links, 
missing, or orphaned (unlinked) files.
To use the Check Links Sitewide feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Files to open the Files panel.
 
 You can also use the F8 shortcut key (Windows or Mac).
 
2. Open the Files panel menu (it’s in the upper-right corner) and choose 
Site➪Check Links Sitewide.
 
 The Link Checker panel appears and displays the results (if any). Each 
listing shows the broken link and the name of the page that contains it 
to the left, as shown in Figure 9-1.

Running Site Reports
638
 
Figure 9-1: 
The Link 
Checker 
lists the 
filename 
and the 
broken link.
 
 
3. To open and edit the page to correct the link, double-click the file-
name shown.
 
 You can then edit the broken link directly from the Link Checker panel 
without opening the file. Click the broken link displayed, and a folder 
icon appears next to it on the right.
 
4. Double-click the folder to open the Select File dialog box and choose 
an available file to correct the link or re-link it to a different file.
 
5. Click OK (Windows) or Choose (Mac).
 
If you want to change a link that appears across several pages, open the Files 
panel menu and choose Site➪Change Links Sitewide. When the panel appears, 
you’re asked what file the original link points to and you can specify a new file 
to link to instead. Warning: This answer changes all links to that file sitewide, 
so don’t use it if you want to change that link only on certain pages.
Running Site Reports
Dreamweaver’s site reports provide a detailed look at potential issues lurk-
ing within your site, as well as assistance in cleaning out redundant or empty 
tags from your pages.
Reports are broken down into two categories:
 
✦ Workflow reports show you where your files have been, and when, and 
are useful if you’re using functions, such as the Check In/Check Out fea-
ture to share your work with others.
 
✦ HTML reports point out design and accessibility issues, such as missing 
ALT tags for images, improperly nested tags, or empty tags that you can 
clean up.
You can run a site report by following these steps:

 As shown in Figure 9-2, we chose all the reports under the HTML 
Reports category.
 
3. Click the Run button to run the selected reports.
 
 The Results panel appears to display the results of each report.
 
 Each report result displays the file, line number, and a description of the 
problem.
 
4. To address a problem shown, double-click the filename to open 
the page.
 
 The page opens for editing, and the section in which the problem occurs 
appears highlighted in Split view.
Checking CSS Compatibility
If you’re using CSS for formatting and layout throughout your site, make 
sure that your page appears properly across all popular browsers, such as 
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape, and Safari. Over the years, different 
browsers adopted CSS at different levels and paces, requiring designers to 
test pages in a variety of browsers and versions.

Checking CSS Compatibility
640
To eliminate this time-consuming task, Dreamweaver introduces the new 
Browser Compatibility Check, which works hand-in-hand with the CSS Advisor 
to discover and report any CSS-related display issues that may occur in 
selected browsers and versions. By default, the Browser Compatibility Check 
checks CSS compatibility in the following browsers: Firefox 1–3; Internet 
Explorer (Windows) 6.0–8.0b1; Internet Explorer (Macintosh) 5.2; Netscape 
Navigator 7.0–8.0; Opera 7.0–9.0; and Safari 1.0–3.0.
For any problem that the Browser Compatibility Check discovers, the 
Results panel displays a description of the problem along with a direct link 
to the Adobe CSS Advisor Web site. The CSS Advisor reports on known 
browser display issues and possible solutions for fixing them.
Follow these steps to test a page with the Browser Compatibility Check:
 
1. Open a page for editing by choosing File➪Open or by selecting it from 
the Files panel.
 
2. At the top-right corner of the Document window, click and hold the 
Check Page button and then choose Check Browser Compatibility 
from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Use the 
Check Page 
button to

CSS in your 
page.
 
 
 The Results panel appears, with the Browser Compatibility tab forward. 
Any results are displayed in this tab.
 
3. To view details and possible solutions for any results that may appear, 
select the result (see Figure 9-4).
 
 The description, as well as a link to the Adobe CSS Advisor, appears on 
the right side of the panel.
 
 Possible compatibility issues are listed along with the filename, line 
number, and a description of the problem.
 
4. Click the link below the detail panel to jump to Adobe’s CSS Advisor 
Web site for solutions.

Getting Connected
When you’re ready to publish your site for the world to see, set up a remote 
server in your site definition so that you can connect and copy files to your 
Web-hosting account or dedicated server.
Typical remote server information consists of an ID and password, an FTP 
(File Transfer Protocol) or network address, and the name of the specific 
directory where your files need to go. This information is available from the 
company whom your hosting service was purchased from or from your net-
work administrator.
To set up your remote connection, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
 
 The Manage Sites panel appears.
 
2. Select your site from the list and click the Edit button.
 
3. When the Site Definition dialog box appears, select the Advanced tab 
at the top and select the Remote Info category that appears on the left.
 
4. Select the method that you use to connect to your Web site from the 
Access drop-down list.
 
 For most hosting accounts, choose the FTP from Access drop-down list. 
If you’re unsure of how to connect to your remote server, contact your 
hosting company or network administrator.
 
5. If you’re using an FTP host, enter the address in the FTP Host text box.
 
 The address is typically a numerical IP or FTP address, such as 
192.1.1.1 or ftp.mywebsite.com.
 
6. If necessary, type the name of the host directory in the Host Directory 
text field.
 
 The host directory is the path to the specific folder where your site files 
are kept on the server. Some FTP addresses are set up to bring you 
directly to the right directory.

Getting Connected
642
 
7. Enter the your login name and password for your account in the Login 
and Password text boxes, respectively; to avoid being prompted for 
your password in the future, select the Save check box next to the 
Password text box.
 
8. To make sure that all your information is correct and the connection 
is set up properly, click the Test button.
 
 A dialog box lets you know that Dreamweaver connected to your site 
successfully. If it doesn’t, double-check the information you entered and 
try again.
 
9. Click OK to update the site definition.
 
If you experience difficulty connecting to your remote server or the connec-
tion is taking unusually long, check the Use Passive FTP option found by 
choosing Site➪Manage Sites➪[Your Site]➪Advanced➪Remote Info. Passive 
FTP can be a workaround if you’re trying to connect from behind a firewall.
Your Web site — live!
After your connection is up and running, you’re ready to upload your files 
and present your Web site to the world. Files can be transferred to and from 
your remote Web server using the built-in FTP functionality of the Files 
panel. The Files panel displays files in your local directory and the remote 
server, and between them, you can put, get, or synchronize site files.
Follow these steps to upload your Web site to a remote Web server:
 
1. Choose Window➪Files to open the Files panel.
 
2. Click the Expand to Show Local and Remote Sites icon.
 
 The panel expands so that you see both the local site and the remote 
site in which you want to copy (upload) the files to.
 
3. Make sure that the correct site definition is selected in the Show drop-
down list at the top-left corner of the panel.
 
 Your local files appear on the right.
 
4. To connect to and display files on the remote Web server, click the 
Connect button at the top of the panel.
 
 When the connection is made, all the files (if any) are displayed on the 
left side of the panel.
 
5. To copy files, select and drag them from the local files on the right to 
the remote files on the left.
 
 Alternatively, select the files you want to copy on the right and click the 
Put button at the top of the Files panel.

 You can put an entire site at once by selecting the root folder at the top 
of your local files panel and clicking the Put button.
 
6. After you copy all the files to the remote Web server, test your site by 
opening a browser and typing the Web site’s URL.
 
 The URL is a full address, such as www.mywebsite.com, or an IP 
address, such as http://192.1.1.1.
 
 If you notice broken images or files, return to Dreamweaver and double-
check that all files were copied to the server and run the Link Checker 
by choosing Site➪Check Links Sitewide.
To retrieve files from a remote Web server, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the file(s) you want to retrieve from the remote files on the left 
side of the Files panel.
 
2. Click the Get button at the top of the panel or drag the files to the 
local root folder on the right.
 
To return your Files panel back to its original position on the right side of 
the workspace, click the Expand button in the top-right corner of the panel 
to deselect it. The Files panel minimizes and docks back with the panel 
group on the right.
Synchronizing your site
Dreamweaver’s handy site synchronization feature compares files between 
your local and remote sites to ensure that both are using the same and the 
most recent versions of your site files. This check is essential if there’s a 
chance that files on the remote server may be more up-to-date or if you’re 
unsure which files have been updated since the last time you worked on a 
Web site.
Follow these steps to synchronize your local and remote directories:
 
1. If the Files panel isn’t already visible, choose Window➪Files to open 
the Files panel.
 
2. Select the site you want to synchronize in the Show drop-down list at 
the top-left corner of the panel.
 
 Your local files appear on the right.
 
3. Click the Connect button at the top of the panel to connect to the 
remote server.
 
 If you’re not viewing your Files panel in Expanded view, choose Remote 
View from the drop-down list at the top to display your remote files.

 4. Click the Synchronize button at the top of the Files panel.
 
 The Synchronize Files dialog box appears.
 
5. From the Synchronize drop-down list, choose whether you want to 
synchronize the whole local site or only files selected in the Files 
panel (if any).
 
6. From the Direction drop-down list, choose whether you want newer 
files put to the remote server, retrieved from the remote sever, or 
both.
 
7. To clean up unused or old files on your remote server, select the 
Delete Remote Files Not on Local Drive check box.
 
8. Click the Preview button to begin the process.
 
 This step may take a while depending on the number of files in your site.

Improving Your Site
Remember that a site is like a living organism; it continues to grow and will 
still need care after it’s live. As you add to your site, find new and innovative 
ways to present information to site visitors; after all, it’s all about giving your 
visitors what they came looking for.
To improve your site and keep visitors coming back, try the following tips:

✦ Solicit feedback from focus groups or colleagues in different fields on 
best and worst features of the site. Use this feedback to assist in design, 
layout, and content decisions.
 
✦ Use Web statistics (often provided free by Web-hosting companies) to 
see where your users are spending the most time and where they exit 
the site.
 
✦ Provide a feedback form to allow site visitors to comment on service 
and information they received, with the opportunity to provide com-
ments and suggestions.
 
✦ Always keep your content fresh. Stale information and features can 
deter return visits and ruin first impressions.
 
✦ Don’t ignore problems that surface. Address broken links, images, or 
misspellings right away.

W
elcome to the world of Flash, one of today’s hottest applications for 
creating eye-catching motion graphics featuring sound, video, and 
visual effects. In this minibook, you explore the whole process, from basic 
graphics creation and animation to complex effects and user interaction.
Creating Your First Flash Document
To get started, create a new blank Flash document and set up your work-
space. You can create a new document in two ways:
 
✦ From the Start page, choose Flash File (ActionScript 3.0) under the 
Create New column.
 
✦ Choose File➪New➪Flash File (ActionScript 3.0).
Your new document is created, and the workspace appears. Before you get 
to work, specify some important settings, such as width and height, for your 
file by using the Document Properties dialog box.
To open the Document Properties dialog box, choose Modify➪Document 
and set the following options:
 
✦ Frames Rate: Because Flash files behave like movies, the Frame Rate is 
an important setting that impacts the performance and playback speed 
of your movie. The default setting of 24 fps (frames per second) should 
do fine.

Getting Familiar with the Workspace

✦ Dimensions: The width and height set here determine the size of your 
stage and in turn, the visible area of your final movie. For now, leave the 
default setting of 550 pixels wide by 400 pixels in height.
 
✦ Background Color: Click the swatch to pick a background color for your 
stage from the Web-safe color palette. This also sets the background 
color of any Web pages created by Flash when you publish your movie 
to the Web.
 
✦ Ruler Units: This drop-down list lets you select the unit of measurement 
used for all measurement values in your document, including document 
size, width and height values, and ruler increments when rules are vis-
ible in the workspace.
When you’re done fine-tuning your document’s properties, click OK.
Getting Familiar with the Workspace
The Flash workspace, as shown in Figure 1-1, is where you create your Flash 
movies. The most prominent item you’ll notice is at the top of your screen: 
the stage. The stage is where the action happens — where you draw, build, 
or import graphics, create text, and construct layouts.

The gray area surrounding the stage is your pasteboard. Items placed here 
aren’t visible in your final movie because they’re outside the bounds of the 
stage. However, it helps to think of this area as backstage — where text, art-
work, and images can make their entrance or exit or be placed until they’re 
ready to appear in your movie.
The Tools panel
What CS4 application would be complete without a fancy toolbar? Flash has 
a comprehensive set of tools for just about any drawing task you’ll need to 
wrap your hands around. Table 1-1 gives you a rundown and description of 
the tools you’ll find. The Tools panel, as shown in Figure 1-2, has been rede-
signed to make your work area flow better. A double arrow at the top lets 
you toggle between expanded and icon views to maximize your work area.

The Timeline
Below the stage sits the Timeline, where you bring your artwork to life 
through animation. The Timeline is composed of frames, each one repre-
senting a point in time moving left to right. The Timeline is further broken 
out into layers; new documents automatically contain one new layer labeled 
Layer 1. Each layer on the Timeline is composed of frames that span horizon-
tally from left to right, each one representing a point in time, just like frames 
in a movie reel (see Figure 1-3).
The Motion Editor
The all-new Motion Editor allows you to see and modify all properties of an 
animation in a graph-style format. All properties that can be animated are 
displayed in rows, each of which contains a value line that can be manipu-
lated to change the behavior of a selected tween. You can also add complex 
forces, such as gravity and inertia, and even add to or subtract from your 
tween without using the Timeline or stage.

The Property inspector
Sitting at the right side of your workspace, the Property inspector allows 
you to get (and set) attributes (such as height and width) for a selected item 
on the stage or work area (see Figure 1-4). When nothing is selected, the 
Property inspector displays your document properties.

The panel group
The panel group sits on the right of the workspace and features multiple 
panels grouped together. Panels can be added to or removed from the panel 
group on the right.
The panel group can’t be freely repositioned in the workspace. However, it 
can be resized or collapsed down to icon view with the double arrows found 
in its upper-right corner.
You can remove and float panels from the panel group. Simply click and drag 
a panel away from the group by its title tab. To add a panel into the group, 
drag it into the panel group on the right.
Managing individual panels
You can position each panel individually anywhere in the workspace by 
dragging it by its title tab. You can find additional appearance options under 
each panel’s menu, accessible from the icon in its upper-right (see Figure 
1-5). Each panel’s panel menu also provides another way of getting to that 
panel’s primary tasks.

a panel.
 
Panel menu
Expand/Collapse
To group panels together, simply drag one on top of the other; after they are 
grouped together, you can move and minimize several panels as one unit. 
This is handy for keeping commonly used or related panels together.
You can save panel groups and panel positions as part of custom work-
spaces. (See the following section “Creating and Saving Workspaces.”)

Creating and Saving Workspaces
656
 
Panels can always be toggled on or off from the Window menu. If you don’t 
see a panel you need or have accidentally closed one, look for it in the 
Window menu. Many panels have shortcut keys; if you use a panel often, use 
its shortcut key combination for easy access.
Creating and Saving Workspaces
One of the most useful additions in recent versions of Flash is the ability to 
save your workspaces (the appearance and layout of workspace items, such 
as the toolbar, Timeline, Property inspector, and panels).
Saving workspaces is essential if you’re sharing a computer workstation with 
others and want to recall your favorite panels and setup instantly. However, 
it can also be useful for maintaining different workspaces for different proj-
ects, even if you’re the only person working on your computer.
To create and save your workspace layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Open and position any panels you want available, including the Tools 
panel, Timeline, Motion Editor, and Property inspector.
 
 You can toggle panels on or off from the Window menu.
 
2. Choose Window➪Workspace➪New Workspace.
 
3. Enter a new name for your workspace and click OK.
 
To recall a workspace, choose Window➪Workspace➪Your Workspace Name 
or select your workspace from the Workspace selector at the top-right 
corner of your screen. The current workspace rebuilds and appears exactly 
as you saved it.
You can view all your saved workspaces at any point by choosing 
Window➪Workspace➪Manage Workspaces. From this panel, you can choose 
to delete or rename existing workspaces at any point.
The default workspaces, such as Default, Classic, and Designer, can’t be 
modified, deleted, or renamed.
Saving and Opening Documents
It’s always recommended that you save your document after you make any 
significant changes or additions, and although not necessary, it’s also a good 
idea to save a new document immediately after creating it. To save a docu-
ment, choose File➪Save. Enter a name for your file and choose a location on 
your hard drive to save it to.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Getting Started 
in Flash CS4
Talking about Layers
657
To open an existing document, choose File➪Open and locate the Flash file 
on your hard drive. Flash files are saved with a .fla extension, and pub-
lished Flash movies are saved with .swf extensions.
You may need at some point to save a copy of your document under a new 
name, either to create an alternate version or perhaps to make it compatible 
with an older version of Flash.
To save a copy of your document under a new name, choose File➪Save As. 
Choose a location on your hard drive and enter a new filename. The drop-
down list at the bottom of the Save As dialog box lets you choose what ver-
sion of Flash you want to save the file in. For example, you can save files one 
version backward into Flash CS3 format.
 
Saving a document for an older version of Flash may make some newer fea-
tures unavailable. Avoid saving your file in an older file format unless you 
absolutely need to make it available to an older version of Flash.
Getting to Know Flash Player 10
The Flash Player is at the heart of Flash technology. The player, which you 
can find as a plug-in to Web browsers or as a standalone application, runs 
and plays completed Flash movies, known as SWF (ShockWave Flash) files.
Beyond simple playback, the Flash Player is also responsible for deciphering 
and carrying out instructions written in ActionScript, Flash’s powerful built-
in scripting language. ActionScript, which is discussed in Chapter 7 in this 
minibook, gives your Flash movies many more abilities, including playback 
control, real-time user interaction, and complex effects.
Your end user needs the Flash Player in order to view your movies. 
Fortunately, at the time of this writing, the Flash Player is in use by 96 per-
cent of Internet-enabled PCs worldwide. If a user doesn’t have the Flash 
Player installed, it’s available as a free download from the Adobe Web site at 
www.adobe.com.
Talking about Layers
If you’ve worked with other programs that utilize layers (such as Photoshop 
or Illustrator), the concept is very much the same. If you’re new to layers, 
think of them as clear pieces of film stacked on top of each other. Each layer 
can contain its own artwork and animations.

Talking about Layers
658
In Flash, you use layers to stack artwork and animations on the stage, allow-
ing them to exist together visually but to be edited or moved independently 
from one another. You can reorder layers to position artwork in front of or 
behind artwork on other layers.
 
 To create a new layer, click the New Layer icon at the bottom of the 
Timeline. The layer is automatically assigned a name; you can rename any 
layer by double-clicking its name and typing a new name.
To delete a layer, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Timeline window below the stage, select the layer you want to 
delete.
 
 Hold down the Shift key to select multiple layers. You can then click the 
Trash icon to delete all the selected layers at once.
 
 2. Click the Delete Layer icon below the Timeline.
The beauty of working with layers is that you can easily change the stacking 
order and appearance of artwork and animations distributed across those 
layers. To reorder layers, simply select a layer by clicking its label on the 
Timeline and then click and drag the layer up or down in the stacking order 
and release it to its new position (see Figure 1-6). Layers at the top of the list 
will appear in front of other objects in lower layers; in contrast, layers at the 
bottom of the list will appear below or behind items on higher layers.
Two additional aspects of managing layers include toggling a layer and its 
contents visible or invisible, and locking layers to prevent their contents 
from being accidentally moved or modified.

It’s easy 
to shuffle 
layers — 
just drag.

Importing Files
659
 
 To toggle a layer’s visibility on or off, click any layer in the column below the 
Eye icon. To toggle all layers on or off, click the Eye icon at the top of the 
column.
 
 To prevent layer contents from being modified, click any layer in the column 
below the Padlock icon. To unlock it, click the Padlock icon again. To lock or 
unlock all layers, click the Padlock icon at the top of the column.
Locking layers ensures that you won’t accidentally move or delete the art-
work it contains. Make a habit of locking layers whenever you’re not working 
with them.
 
Layer visibility only affects what you see inside the authoring environment 
and has no effect on the finished SWF file. Layers whose visibility is toggled 
off in your document will still appear when published.
Importing Files
There will be times when you need to bring resources — such as artwork or 
photo files created in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, MP3 sound files, and 
even video files — that weren’t created in Flash. You can import the follow-
ing file formats into Flash:
 
✦ JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, EPS files
 
✦ Flash SWF files
 
✦ Native Adobe Illustrator (.ai) and Photoshop (.psd) files
 
✦ AIFF, WAV, and MP3 audio files
 
✦ MPEG, MOV, DV, QuickTime, and FLV video files
You can import these files directly to the stage for immediate use or to your 
document’s library (which you find out more about in Chapter 3 of this mini-
book) for storage until you’re ready to place them on the stage.
Follow these steps to import files to the stage:
 
1. Choose File➪Import➪Import to Stage.
 
2. Select the file(s) from your hard drive that you want to import.
 
 Imported items are placed on the stage on the currently selected layer 
and frame.

Exporting Files from Flash
660
To import files directly to the library:
 
1. Choose File➪Import➪Import to Library.
 
2. Select the files from your hard drive that you want to import and click 
the Open button.
 
 Imported files don’t appear on the stage but are available in the Library 
panel for use later on.
 
To select multiple files for import, hold down the Shift key when prompted 
to select files from your hard drive. You’ll be able to bring several files to the 
stage or library in one step.
Exporting Files from Flash
In contrast to the Import menu, the Export menu is used to generate files 
from your current document out of Flash, most often to create a compressed 
SWF file (movie) for final delivery. Additionally, it can be used to generate 
static images (such as JPEGs or GIFs) from specific frames in your movie.
FLA and SWF files
The life of a Flash project involves at least two 
different types of files: your authoring file (FLA) 
in which all your work is created; and the final 
product, your compressed movie or SWF file.
FLA files work only within the Flash CS4 applica-
tion (the authoring environment). When you’re 
ready to distribute your finished movie, publish 
an SWF file that can be displayed by the Flash 
Player.
These SWF files can be created from the 
Publish or Export menu options and are com-
pressed movie files (typically smaller than their 
FLA counterparts) that contain all the graph-
ics and information necessary to display your 
movie.
The Flash Player can’t read FLA files, and SWF 
files can’t be deconstructed into usable FLA 
files. Changes to your Flash movie are always 
done in the original FLA file and must be re-
exported to a new SWF file if you want to view 
them in the Flash Player.

Publishing Your Final Movie
661
Publishing Your Final Movie
The final step in getting your movie ready to be posted on the Web, distrib-
uted on a CD-ROM, or sent through e-mail is the publishing process. The 
publishing process handles two important tasks: exporting the final SWF file 
playable by the Flash Player and creating any additional files (such as Web 
pages) necessary to display your movie. The File menu’s Publish Settings 
and Publish options handle the setup and publishing of your movie so that 
you can show the world your new creation.
Flash can create any and all the following file types at publish time:
 
✦ SWF files
 
✦ JPG, GIF, or PNG bitmap files
 
✦ Projector files
 
 If you want to distribute your movie as a standalone file, you can create 
a Mac or PC compatible projector that includes the Flash Player.
 
✦ HTML files
 
 To display your movies on the Web, you’ll need to contain them within a 
Web page, or HTML file. Flash takes care of creating this page for you.
 
✦ QuickTime movies

✓ Using the Paintbrush tool
M
any great creations start with the most basic of shapes and build 
from there. In this chapter, you discover the secrets of drawing 
shapes and lines and working with colors in Flash.
Drawing Shapes and Lines
To get your creation started, become familiar with the Shape and Line tools 
on the Tools panel and use them as the starting point for everything from 
basic buttons to complex illustrations.
When you’re ready to create more complex artwork beyond what the Shape 
and Line tools offer, the Pen and Pencil tools are standing by. These tools 
work very differently, and for that reason, should be chosen based on the 
kind of artwork you want to create.
The following sections show you how to get started creating basic shapes 
and lines.
Drawing basic shapes with the shape tools
 
 
On the Tools panel, locate the Rectangle tool; also notice a small arrow at 
the lower-right corner of the icon, which means that more tools are hidden 
underneath. Click and hold the Rectangle tool to reveal the Oval and 
Polystar tools; select the shape tool you want to use.
Before you draw the shape, set some colors for your shape with the two 
swatches located at the bottom of the Tools panel. The Fill color swatch 

Drawing Shapes and Lines
664
(indicated by the paint bucket icon) lets you set what color your shape will 
be filled with. The Stroke Color swatch (indicated by the ink bottle icon) 
controls the outline color.
Flash lets you choose colors from the Swatches panel. You can add your 
own colors to this panel, but for now, choose one of the available colors for 
your shape’s fill and stroke.
 
Click and drag on the stage to create a shape. Notice that by default, shapes 
are drawn from the left corner outward. You can draw shapes from the 
center (which is sometimes easier) by holding down the Option (Mac) or Alt 
(Windows) key while drawing the shape.
 
To constrain a shape proportionally, hold down the Shift key while drawing 
or resizing.
Merging shapes
If you overlap two or more shapes in Flash, they automatically merge, or 
become one complete shape. You can take advantage of this behavior by 
using an overlapping shape to knock out another, or you can make more 
complex shapes by combining simpler ones.
You may also find that overlapping strokes results in divided fill areas, 
which can be a desirable effect. Experiment by drawing and overlapping 
shapes and using the Selection tool to select parts of the resulting object.
Creating perfect lines with the Line tool
 
 
The Line tool makes constructing perfect, straight lines quick and easy. To 
create a straight line, choose the Line tool from the Tools panel, click and 
drag on your stage where you want the line to start, and release the mouse 
button where you want the line to end.
To modify your line’s color or appearance, select it with the Selection tool 
and use the Property inspector to change the stroke color and size. You also 
find a Style drop-down list, which lets you choose among straight, dotted, 
dashed, and artistic stroke styles.
 
To create perfectly vertical or horizontal lines, hold down the Shift key while 
using the Line tool. You can also create diagonal lines in 45-degree increments 
with this same method.
Creating lines and curves with the Pen tool
Using the Pen tool may be a bit different than you’re used to, unless of course, 
you’ve used the Pen tool in applications like Illustrator or Photoshop. The 

Book VII
Chapter 2
Drawing in 
Flash CS4
Drawing Shapes and Lines
665
Pen tool isn’t a freehand drawing tool; rather, it allows you to create paths, or 
outlines, composed by connecting anchor points. When you click and create 
new points, lines are automatically drawn connecting those points together. 
You can then either bend those lines into precise curves or leave them 
straight.
The best way to understand the Pen tool is to practice working with it. 
Visualize a shape you want to draw (for example, a leaf), and try to create it 
with the Pen tool.
To get started, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Pen tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Use the Color swatch on the bottom of the Tools panel to set a stroke 
color.
 
3. Click to set the first point on the stage and then construct a line by 
clicking again to set a second point where you want the line to end.
 
4. Click to set a new point and before releasing the mouse button, drag 
to the left or right to bend the new line into a curve.
 
 The more you drag in a particular direction, the more extreme the curve 
will be.
 
5. Continue creating new points and experimenting with different curves.
 
6. Move your mouse pointer over the first point you created (a loop appears 
above the icon) and click to close the path and complete the shape.
 
The Pen tool attempts to continue a curve in the same direction even after 
a new point is set. To reset the last point drawn back to a straight line, hold 
down the Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key and click the last point created 
before setting a new one.
Drawing freehand with the Pencil tool
The precise nature of the Pen tool is great for certain situations, but if you 
prefer the intuitive feel of freehand drawing or want to create more natural 
or rough artwork, consider using the Pencil tool.
An attractive feature of the Pencil tool is that it has three different modes to 
choose from. Each mode provides a different level of smoothing, so even if 
your hand isn’t the steadiest, the Pencil tool compensates by automatically 
smoothing out lines or curves while you create them.
 
 Select the Pencil tool and choose the appropriate smoothing mode using the 
selector at the bottom-right corner of the Tools panel:

Selecting and Editing Shapes
666
 
✦ Straighten: Forces lines to the nearest straight line; perfect for drawing 
or tracing straight edges or boxy outlines.
 
✦ Smooth: Smoothes out lines or curves to the next closest perfect curve.
 
✦ Ink: Provides less smoothing and keeps lines and curves as natural as 
possible.
 
The mode you select depends completely on what type of shapes and lines 
you’re trying to draw. If your shape is more diverse than one mode can 
handle, you can switch modes from line to line as needed.
Selecting and Editing Shapes
 
 After you create a shape, you can select and move it by using the Selection 
tool at the top of the Tools panel. Flash shapes are easy to edit because you 
can select the stroke and fill independently to separate one from the other.
To select and move the stroke or fill only, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Click once on either your shape’s stroke or fill to activate it.
 
 To select the entire shape, double-click the fill of your shape or use the 
Selection tool to drag around it on the stage (see Figure 2-1).
 
3. Click and drag the selected stroke or fill or use the arrow keys to sepa-
rate it from the rest of the shape.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Select the 
fill (left) or 
the stroke 
(right).
 
Modifying fill and stroke colors
You can choose your fill and stroke colors ahead of time before you start 
drawing, but if you change your mind, modifying colors is easy to do.
You can modify either the fill or stroke colors of a pre-existing shape in the 
three ways:
 
✦ Select the entire shape and change its fill and/or stroke colors from the 
swatches on the Property inspector (see Figure 2-2).

✦ Select the entire shape and change your fill and/or stroke colors with 
the Fill and Stroke swatches on the Tools panel.
 
✦ Set your colors on the Tools panel and use the Ink Bottle tool by clicking 
the stroke or use the Paint Bucket tool by clicking the fill.
To apply a fill color to your shape, select it on the stage and choose a color 
from the Fill swatch at the bottom of the Tools panel. Grab the Paint Bucket 
tool and click inside of your shape. To apply a stroke color, select a color 
from the Stroke swatch at the bottom of the Tools panel, and select the Ink 
Bottle tool. Click once on the edge of your shape to set a stroke with the 
selected color.
 
You can also set Fill or Stroke colors from the Fill and Stroke section of the 
Property inspector when the Ink Bottle or Paint Bucket tools are selected.
 
 
To remove a fill or stroke completely, select a shape, and select None from 
either the Fill or Stroke color swatch.

Merge versus Object Drawing mode
The ability to freely tear apart shapes can be very flexible and useful, but 
some prefer to work with shapes as single objects (similar to how Illustrator 

Splicing and Tweaking Shapes and Lines
668
CS4 does). For this reason, Object Drawing mode was created; this optional 
mode automatically combines the stroke and fill of a shape into a single 
object, which you can move and resize as a whole. Shapes drawn in Object 
Drawing mode have a bounding box around them; the stroke and fill are 
moved together as one object.
 
 You can enable Object Drawing mode when any drawing or shape tool is 
selected, as shown in Figure 2-3, by selecting the Object Drawing mode 
button at the bottom of the Tools panel. Try drawing a shape on the stage 
with this enabled; you’ll notice that the shape appears with a bounding box 
around it, and the stroke and fill can no longer be individually selected and 
separated.
To convert a shape drawn with Object Drawing mode to its raw form, select 
the shape and choose Modify➪Break Apart, or double-click the shape to edit 
it within the Drawing Object itself.
 
Figure 2-3:

mode.
 
 
Unlike shapes drawn in standard mode, Drawing Objects can’t be merged 
together; break any Drawing Objects apart first, or choose Modify➪Combine 
Objects➪Union to merge them together.
Splicing and Tweaking Shapes and Lines
You can easily dissect mergeable shapes (not Drawing Objects) by selecting 
only certain portions with the Selection or Lasso tools, as shown in Figure 
2-4. Try drawing a marquee around only half the shape with the Selection or 
Subselection arrow; notice that only half the shape or line becomes selected, 
and you can then separate it.

Tweaking a shape with the Selection 
and Subselection tools
If you need to tweak the shape beyond its original form, you can use 
Selection or Subselection tools to tweak, distort, and reshape. To tweak 
or reshape with the Selection tool, move it outside and close to an edge or 
corner of your shape; notice a small curved or angled line icon appears next 
to your pointer. Click and drag to bend, reshape, and distort the outline of 
your shape, as shown in Figure 2-5.

You can use the Selection tool to bend straight edges into curves. Try it on a 
line or straight edge from a rectangle, and you’ll see that you can easily pull 
the line into a curve!
To tweak or reshape with the Subselection tool, click the outside edge or 
stroke of a shape to activate its path. Each point is represented by a hollow 
box. Click any point to activate it; click and drag it or move it using the 
arrow keys to reshape (see Figure 2-6).

Editing a shape with the Lasso tool
When you need to create a selection with more precision than the Selection 
tool allows (for example, around an odd shape or a tricky area), use the 
Lasso tool. The Lasso tool draws freehand selections around specific areas 
of your artwork. To draw a selection with the Lasso tool, select it from the 
Tools panel and click and drag to draw a selection around the target area, 
as shown in Figure 2-7. Make sure to close the selection by overlapping the 
starting and ending points.
You can perform partial selections only with raw (broken apart) shapes and 
lines. Artwork drawn in Object Drawing mode needs to be broken apart first 
(choose Modify➪Break Apart) or modified in edit mode. To enter a Drawing 
Object’s edit mode, double-click it with the Selection tool.

Modifying artwork created with 
the Pen and Pencil tools
Interestingly enough, although the Pen and Pencil tools behave in com-
pletely different ways, both ultimately create the same thing: paths. These 
paths can be filled (if closed) or modified on a point-by-point basis, or you 
can apply a stroke to them.
To fine-tune a path, choose the Subselection tool (white arrow) from the 
Tools panel. Click the path; it becomes highlighted, and the points show up 
as hollow boxes. You can now select any individual point and selectively 
drag it or move it with the arrow keys to reshape the path.
To adjust a curve with the Subselection tool, highlight the point adjacent to 
the curve you want to modify. A handle appears; you can grab and move this 
handle to adjust the curve.
To add or subtract points, click and hold down on the Pen tool to select 
the Add Anchor Point or Subtract Anchor Point tools. Click exactly on the 
path where you want to add an anchor point or click directly on a point to 
remove it.
Transforming Artwork and Shapes
After you have some drawing done, you may want to adjust the width, 
height, or rotation of your artwork. Depending on the level of precision 
you’re looking for, you can do this in two ways: manually with the Transform 
tool or by dialing in exact values on the Transform panel.
Using the Transform tool
 
 Select a shape or artwork on your stage and then choose the Transform tool 
from the Tools panel. A bounding box with handles at all four sides and cor-
ners appears, as shown in Figure 2-8. You can drag any of the side handles to 
resize the width and height.
To rotate your artwork, hover over any corner handle until you see the rota-
tion icon (a circular arrow) and then click and drag to rotate your artwork 
freely.
To resize your art proportionally, hold down the Shift key while dragging a 
handle. If you hold down the Shift key while in rotation mode, it limits your 
movements to precise 45-degree increments.

Transforming  Artwork and Shapes

Transform 
tool on a

Using the Transform panel
For those times when you need to dial in exact transformation values, 
you can use the Transform panel, which you can open by choosing 
Window➪Transform (see Figure 2-9). The Transform panel uses text boxes 
where you can enter exact transformation values for width and height or a 
specific rotation angle in degrees.
Follow these steps to transform artwork with the Transform panel:
 
1. Select the object you want to transform on the stage and open the 
Transform panel by choosing Window➪Transform.
 
2. To increase the size of the artwork, enter width and height percentage 
values above 100 percent; to decrease the size, enter values below 100 
percent. To keep the sizes proportional, select the Constrain Values 
check box.
 
3. To rotate your artwork, select the Rotate radio button, click the 
number to activate the text box, type a value above 0 degrees, and 
press Enter.
 
 Rotation is performed clockwise; to rotate counter-clockwise, enter a 
negative number.

Working with Type
673
Skewing your artwork
Skewing transforms your artwork on a 3D plane and can add interesting per-
spective to your shape. You can perform skewing with the Transform panel 
by selecting the Skew option button and entering values for horizontal and 
vertical skew amounts.
Give it a try: Select your shape, type in some Skew values, and press Enter to 
see the transformation applied. If you’re not happy, don’t fret; simply click 
the Remove Transform button in the lower-right corner of the Transform 
panel to set everything back to normal.
Working with Type
 
 
If you’re looking to display important information in your Flash movie or 
simply want to add creative text elements to your design, Flash’s flexible 
Text tool can create attractive type for design elements, buttons, titles, and 
informational text areas.
To create a line of type, select the Text tool from the Tools panel, click a 
location on the stage, and begin typing. With the Property inspector, fine-
tune your text’s size, typeface, alignment, and color, as shown in Figure 2-10. 
Additional options in the Property inspector, such as paragraph formatting 
and alignment, can help with larger blocks of text.
To edit type, choose the Text tool and click the text you want to edit. When 
the blinking cursor appears, you can select, add, or modify the text. While 
the text is selected, you can also change colors, typeface, and size with the 
Property inspector.
Transforming type
You can transform type just like shapes and artwork by using either the 
Transform tool or the Transform panel. Regardless of any transformations 
you put your type through, it remains editable.
To transform a line of type, make sure that it’s active by first selecting it with 
the Selection or Text tools. To transform, choose the Transform tool or open 
the Transform panel.
Distorting and modifying character shapes
You can distort and modify type outlines just like any other shape or path. 
However, type is created on a special type path so that it can be edited at 
any point. You’ll need to break your type characters off a path first in order 
to tweak any of their outlines.

Creating Colors and Gradients

To modify or distort type outlines, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the type you want to modify and choose Modify➪Break Apart.
 
2. If your type is longer than a single character, repeat Step 1.
 
3. Use the Selection or Subselection tool to modify the outlines (as dem-
onstrated with shapes earlier in the chapter).
 
4. (Optional) Use the Ink Bottle tool to apply a stroke to your type.
Creating Colors and Gradients
You’ve undoubtedly seen and made use of the built-in color swatches in 
Flash, but suppose that you want to use colors that are not included in the 
Swatches panel. Here’s where the Color panel comes into play. From this 
panel, you can mix and create your own color swatches, make gradients, and 
even apply transparency effects to existing colors on the stage.
You’ve already seen the Swatches panel in action — you used it to select 
fill and stroke colors from the Tools panel and Property inspector. The 
Swatches panel exists on its own free-floating panel as well, which you can 
open by choosing Window➪Swatches.

Book VII
Chapter 2

Creating Colors and Gradients
675
The 256 colors on this panel represent the Web-safe color spectrum, which 
is optimized to make sure that any user, even those with monitors using 
lower color depth settings, can enjoy your creations.
You can add colors to the Swatches panel from the Color panel, which 
means that you have access to your own custom colors from anywhere the 
Swatches panel appears.
Creating and adding colors from the Color panel
The Color panel features two ways to select a precise color: the color wheel 
on the right or the sliders on the left. You can combine the two methods to 
hone in on just the right shade. After you choose the color you want, you 
can easily add it as a swatch to the Swatches panel by choosing Add Swatch 
from the panel menu, as shown in Figure 2-11.
 
Figure 2-11: 
Select a 
custom 
color with 
the sliders 
or color 
wheel.
 
To apply a color choice automatically to the stroke or fill swatches, click 
either the Fill or Stroke color swatch on the top-left corner of the Color 
panel. Any changes made using the color wheel or sliders are applied auto-
matically to the selected swatch.
To select a color on the color wheel, click and drag the cross hair inside the 
color wheel until you find the right hue (for example, greens). Use the slider 
to the right to select the exact shade of that color.
To select a color with the sliders, first select either the RGB (Red, Green, 
Blue) or HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) sliders from the Color panel’s 
panel menu. Move the sliders to find the exact color you want. You can fine-
tune this color further with the color wheel and slider.
To save your new color as a swatch, find your desired color and choose 
Add Swatch from the panel menu. Your new color appears as a new swatch 
on the Swatches panel, and you can select it anywhere the Swatches panel 
appears.

Creating Colors and Gradients
676
Creating gradients
Gradients are blends between two or more colors that you can use to fill any 
area or shape, just like a solid color. If you look at the Swatches panel, you see 
some gradient presets that you can use right away. You can also use the Color 
panel to create your own gradients and add them to the Swatches panel.
Follow these steps to create a gradient:
 
1. Open the Color panel by choosing Window➪Color and choose Linear 
from the Type drop-down list.
 
 Linear is one of two gradient types that you can create.
 
2. Double-click one of the horizontal sliders that appears above the gra-
dient ramp at the bottom to see the Swatches panel; pick a color to 
apply to that slider.
 
 To add more colors to your gradient, click anywhere on the gradient 
ramp to add a slider. You can then double-click this slider to set the 
color.
 
3. Adjust the color blends of the gradient by moving the sliders closer 
together or farther apart.
 
 To remove colors or sliders, click the slider you want to remove and 
drag it off the panel to the left or right.
 
4. Choose Add Swatch from the panel menu to save your new gradient.
 
 The gradient swatch is added to your Swatches panel alongside the 
existing gradients.
In addition to linear gradients, which blend colors evenly in a straight line, 
you can create radial gradients. Radial gradients are a special type of gradi-
ent shape where colors blend from the center outward in a circular motion. 
To set a gradient as a radial gradient, choose Radial from the Type drop-down 
list on the Color panel. To set a gradient as a linear gradient, choose Linear 
from the Type drop-down list.
Both gradient types are created and added to the Swatches panel in the 
exact same manner, as described in the preceding step list.
Applying and transforming gradients
After you create a gradient, you can use it to fill a shape the same way you’d set 
a solid fill color. After you apply a gradient to a shape on the stage, you can use 
the Gradient tool to modify the gradient’s direction, size, and intensity.

Working with the Paintbrush Tool
677
To modify a gradient fill, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Click and hold down your mouse pointer on the Free Transform tool 
to select the Gradient Transform tool. Select a shape with a gradient 
fill.
 
 A bounding box appears.
 
2. Use the bounding box’s center point to move the transition point of 
the gradient.
 
3. Use the handle on the right side to modify the intensity of the gradient.
 
4. Change the direction of the gradient by using the rotating arrow icon 
at the upper-right corner of the selection area.
If you’re working with a radial gradient, you’ll notice the Gradient Transform 
tool behaves slightly differently. An extra round handle appears to let you 
scale the gradient, and the rotating arrow icon (which rotates the gradient 
area) is located on the bottom right. Experiment with both linear and radial 
gradients to see the differences.
Working with the Paintbrush Tool
 
 Tools, such as the Pen and Pencil, offer you different ways of creating 
stroked paths. In contrast, the Paintbrush tool paints with fills. A lot like a 
good old-fashioned paintbrush, this tool can create thick, broad strokes with 
solid colors or gradients for excellent artistic effects.
The Paintbrush tool features several different brush sizes and tips, as well as 
five modes for controlling how (and where) the Paintbrush tool does its magic.
Follow these steps to use the Paintbrush tool:
 
1. With the Paintbrush tool selected, choose a brush size and tip shape 
from the very bottom of the Tools panel.
 
2. Choose a fill color from the Fill color swatch on the Tools panel, 
Property inspector, or Color panel.
 
3. Freely paint on the stage to see the Paintbrush tool in action.
The different Paintbrush modes change where and how the tool works 
against different objects on the stage. A good way to see these modes in 
action is to draw a shape on the stage and make sure that the shape has 
both a stroke and fill set. Experiment by changing between the different 

Working with the Paintbrush Tool
678
modes and trying to paint over the shape. In Figure 2-12, the selected object 
was painted over with the Paintbrush tool in Paint Selection mode. This 
mode affects only the area of the selected shape.
 
Figure 2-12: 
Painting 
with Paint 
Selection 
mode 
affects only 
the selected 
shape.
 
Because the strokes left behind by the Paintbrush tool are simply filled 
shapes, you can apply a stroke to it, change its fill color, or use it to create 
interesting shapes that you can tweak by using the same methods demon-
strated in the “Transforming Artwork and Shapes” section, earlier in this 
chapter.
To apply an outline to a painted area, set a color by using the Stroke color 
swatch on the Tools panel, select the Ink Bottle tool, and click the outer 
edge of the fill. You can now use the Property inspector to change the width, 
color, and style of the stroke as well.

fter you’re familiar with Flash’s drawing tools, explore what Flash is 
best known for: animation. In this chapter, you bring your creations 
to life with movement, interactivity, and sounds. Flash CS4 introduces some 
significant new changes to the way animation is created on the Timeline, 
which will be exciting for new and experienced users alike.
First, you’ll explore some central concepts in Flash: symbols and the library. 
Because symbols are an essential part of creating animation in Flash, you’ll 
discover how to create and modify symbols before diving into your first ani-
mation tasks.
Visiting the Library
Each Flash document contains a library, a repository of reusable graphics, 
animations, buttons, sounds, video, and even fonts. As you build your Flash 
movie, you can add any piece of artwork you’ve created on the stage to your 
library, where the artwork’s stored as a symbol (as shown in Figure 3-1).
What makes symbols so powerful is that you can reuse them as many times 
as necessary. Simply drag and drop a copy (referred to as an instance) from 
the Library panel onto the stage anywhere in your movie. Most importantly, 
each instance remains linked to the original in your library. Any changes 
made to the original (or master) automatically update any instances of that 
same symbol used throughout the movie.

Figure 3-1: 
The Library

as well as

Symbols are broken down into three main categories: graphics, buttons, and 
movie clips. You can find out more about button and movie clip symbols in 
Chapters 6 and 7 of this minibook.
Creating and Modifying Graphic Symbols
Certain types of animation in Flash require the use of symbols, so it’s a good 
time to become familiar with the most basic of symbol types: graphics. You 
can convert any object on the stage into a graphic symbol, allowing you to 
take advantage of additional features unique to symbols. You can also create 
empty graphic symbols from the Library panel or by choosing Insert➪New 
Symbol and adding content to them afterward.

Book VII
Chapter 3

Animation
Creating and Modifying Graphic Symbols
681
Follow these steps to create a graphic symbol:
 
1. Choose Insert➪New Symbol or choose New Symbol from the panel 
menu located in the top-right corner of the Library panel.
 
 The Create New Symbol dialog box appears.
 
2. Assign a name to the symbol, choose Graphic from the Type drop-
down list, and click OK.
 
 You see a blank slate on the stage where you can add to your symbol.
 
3. Choose Scene 1 from the navigation bar above the stage to exit the 
symbol and return to the main Timeline.
 
 You now see your new symbol listed in the Library panel.
Follow these steps to create a graphic symbol from existing artwork on the 
stage:
 
1. With the Selection tool, select the object(s) on the stage that you want 
to convert to a symbol.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a name for the symbol, choose Graphic from the Type drop-
down list, and click OK.
 
 Your new symbol now appears listed in the Library panel.
 
 Whenever you convert existing graphics to a symbol, the graphics remain on 
the stage, enclosed inside a blue bounding box (see Figure 3-2). Your 
Property inspector confirms that the selection is now a graphic symbol 
(indicated by the icon).
 
Don’t confuse symbols with Drawing Objects — both display artwork inside 
a bounding box, but Drawing Objects don’t have the same abilities that 
symbols have, nor are they stored automatically in your library. Use the 
Property inspector to determine whether an object is a symbol or a Drawing 
Object if you’re unsure — a distinctive icon and description appear for each 
one at the top of the Property inspector.
Adding symbols to the stage
After you add graphic symbols to your library, if you need to reuse one, you 
can simply drag a copy from the Library panel and drop it on to the stage 
(see Figure 3-3). Each copy of a symbol is referred to as an instance in Flash. 
Although all these instances remain linked to the original, you have the flex-
ibility to scale, transform, and rotate each instance individually.

Follow these steps to add symbols to the stage:
 
1. Locate a symbol in your library that you want to add to the stage.
 
2. Drag a copy from the Library panel to the stage; repeat this a few 
times so that you have several instances on the stage.
 
3. Select each instance individually and experiment with different 
scaling, transforming, and rotating for each one.
Modifying symbols
After you create symbols, you can modify them from within the library or 
directly on the stage. Changes made to a symbol are applied to all instances 
of that symbol throughout the movie.
To edit a symbol from within the library, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a symbol in your Library panel and choose Edit from the panel 
menu, or double-click any symbol in the Library panel.
 
 To really see the effect of editing the master symbol, use a symbol you 
dragged previously to the stage.
 
 The symbol appears on the stage in edit mode.
 
2. Make some changes in color, shape, or size.
 
3. Exit the symbol by selecting Scene 1 from the navigation bar above 
the stage to return to the main Timeline.
 
 Instances of this symbol on the stage reflect the changes you’ve made to 
the symbol in the library.
Editing a symbol in place on the stage can be more intuitive, as you may 
want to modify it to work better with other artwork on the stage. You can 
directly edit a symbol from any of its instances on the stage (as shown in 
Figure 3-4), but keep in mind that regardless of which instance you edit, all 
instances will be affected.
To edit a symbol in place, follow these steps:
 
1. Select and double-click any symbol instance on the stage.
 
 You’re now in the symbol’s edit mode, but you can still see the other 
objects on the stage in the background. Flash dims objects in the back-
ground so that you can see your changes in context.
 
2. Make your changes and exit the symbol’s edit mode by selecting 
Scene 1 on the navigation bar above the stage.

Sorting symbols
Symbols in your library can be sorted using any of the column headers at the 
top of the symbol list. You may only be able to see Name and Linkage at first 
glance, but if you use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the panel, you 
can see additional columns for Use Count, Date Modified, and Type.
To sort by any column, click the column name. If the arrow next to the 
column name is pointing up, the sort is descending, with the highest value 
up; if the arrow is pointing down, the sort is ascending, with the lowest value 
up top.
Duplicating symbols
You may want to create a variation of one of your symbols that goes beyond 
what you can do on an instance-by-instance basis. A good example is two 
birds that are similar in appearance, but one has different shaped wings or 
a different base color. This instance would be a good case for duplicating an 
existing symbol so that any changes can be made to the copy and treated as 
a new symbol.
To duplicate a symbol, select the symbol in the library you want to copy and 
choose Duplicate from the panel menu in the top-right corner of the panel. 
You’re given a chance to name the new version of the symbol when the 
Duplicate Symbol dialog box appears.
 
You can rename any symbol directly from the Library panel. Select the 
symbol and choose Rename from the panel menu.

A closer look at the Library panel
Your Library panel is the main storage location 
for all your symbols, and very much like any 
library, it has essential organizational tools that 
make managing your symbols easy.
The most basic and common functions are 
made easy through several icons found along 
the bottom of the panel (see figure):
 ✓ Panel menu: All panels have panel menus, 
which offer additional options or modify the 
view of the panel itself. The Library panel’s 
panel menu carries out additional symbol 
and library-related tasks.
 ✓ Pin Library: Clicking this icon makes sure 
that the current library stays active even 
when you switch between other open doc-
uments. Normal behavior (unpinned) is for 
library views to switch automatically when 
moving between open documents.
 ✓ New Library: Creates a duplicate Library 
panel in case you want multiple, distinctive 
views of your current library. You can also 
open a new Library panel to view libraries 
from other currently open documents.
 ✓ Search: The text box and magnifying glass 
under the preview panel allow you to search 
for symbols by name in the library, which is 
especially helpful for large libraries. Simply 
type a full or partial name and the panel will 
display matches (if any exist).
 ✓ New Symbol: Create a new symbol, iden-
tical to the command found by choosing 
Insert➪New Symbol.
 ✓ New Folder: Create folders that you can 
sort your symbols into for easy categoriza-
tion. You can create folders within folders 
for even finer sorting capabilities.
 ✓ Properties: If a symbol is highlighted in your 
library, clicking the Properties icon opens 
the Symbol Properties window. From here, 
you can redefine the symbol’s name, type, 
or registration point.
 ✓ Trash Can: Yes, you guessed it — this 
symbol deletes (trashes) the currently high-
lighted symbol in the library. Be careful with 
this: No warning is given before the deed is 
done. However, you can choose Edit➪Undo 
to reverse this action, if necessary.

Painting with Symbols
Flash CS4 introduces two new tools that enable you to get truly creative with 
symbols: the Spray Brush and Deco tools. These tools rely on symbols from 
your library, allowing you to paint random textures or fill areas with com-
plex patterns. You can even easily draw symmetrical artwork with the Deco 
tool’s included Symmetry Brush mode.
The Spray Brush tool
The Spray Brush tool paints with instances of a single symbol from your 
library. You can use the Property inspector to dial in settings for scaling, 
randomness, and brush size.
Follow these steps to paint with the Spray Brush tool:
 
1. Click the New Layer button (found below the Timeline) to create a 
new, empty layer to paint on.
 
2. Select the Spray Brush tool from the Tools panel (click and hold down 
on the Brush tool to find the Spray Brush tool).
 
 The Property inspector displays options for the Spray Brush tool.
 
3. In the Property inspector, click the Edit button in the Symbol options 
area.
 
 The Swap Symbol dialog box appears, prompting you to select a symbol 
from your library.
 
4. Choose a symbol and click OK to exit the dialog box.
 
5. In the Symbol options area, use the Scale Width and Scale Height slid-
ers to reduce or increase the scaling for each instance painted on the 
stage.
 
6. In the Brush options area, enter values for the Width and Height of 
the brush, and if desired, Brush Angle.
 
7. Click and drag on the stage to begin painting.
 
 The Spray Brush paints with the symbol you selected using the settings 
you chose in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
The Spray Brush tool creates groups from all the paint droplets it leaves 
behind. You can break apart these groups by choosing Modify➪Break Apart, 
or edit its contents by double-clicking the group on the stage.

The Deco tool
 
 The new Deco tool features three different modes: Vine Fill, Grid Fill, and the 
Symmetry Brush for creating interesting textures, patterns, and symmetrical 
drawings. Like the Spray Brush tool, the Deco tool uses symbols from your 
library.
In the following steps, we show you how to experiment with the Deco tool’s 
three different drawing effects using symbols from your library. First, we 
show you how to use the Vine Fill:
 
1. Open or create a new Flash document, and add at least two graphic 
symbols to your library with the methods described earlier in this 
chapter.
 
2. Select the Deco tool from the Tools panel.
 
 The Property inspector changes to reflect that the current drawing 
effect is set to Vine Fill.
 
 Vine Fill mode creates a vine-style pattern between two symbols, using 
one as the leaf (that decorates the vine path) and one as the flower (that 
appears at the end of each vine).
 
3. In the Leaf section of the Property inspector, click the Edit button to 
select a symbol from your library to serve as the leaf.

688
 
4. From the dialog box that appears, choose a symbol from your library 
and click OK to set that symbol.
 
5. In the Flower section of the Property inspector, click the Edit button 
to select a symbol from your library to serve as the flower.
 
6. From the dialog box that appears, select a symbol from your library 
and click OK to set that symbol.
 
7. In the Advanced Options section of the Property inspector, click the 
color swatch and choose a color for the vine that will interconnect the 
two symbols you’ve chosen when the pattern is created.
 
8. Click the New Layer button below the Timeline to create a new, empty 
layer to paint on.
 
9. Click the stage, and the Deco tool begins to draw a new vine pattern 
using the symbols you’ve chosen.
 
 The Deco tool draws a vine and caps the vine with the flower symbol 
you chose. Continue to click and release to draw new vines.
To give the Grid Fill drawing effect a try, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Layer button below the Timeline to create a new empty 
layer to use with the Grid Fill.
 
2. If the Deco tool isn’t active, select Deco tool from the Tools panel.
 
3. Change the drawing effect from Vine Fill to Grid Fill with the drop-
down list at the top of the Property inspector.
 
 Grid Fill creates a uniform grid-style pattern within a selected area. You 
can use Grid Fill to fill a specific shape on the stage, or the entire stage 
itself.
 
4. Click the Edit button to select the fill symbol.
 
5. When the Swap Symbol dialog box appears, choose a symbol from 
your library to use as a pattern and click OK.
 
6. In the Property inspector, click and drag over the Horizontal Spacing 
and Vertical Spacing values to set the desired distance (in pixels) 
between each row and column.
 
7. (Optional) Use the Pattern Scale slider to reduce or increase the size 
of the symbol used to create the pattern.
 
8. Click the stage with the Deco tool, and the stage fills up with a grid pat-
tern using the symbol and settings you chose, as shown in Figure 3-6.

The last drawing effect we show you how to use is the Symmetry Brush, 
which lets you draw cool symmetrical artwork with symbols. Follow these 
steps to use the Symmetry Brush:
 
1. Click the New Layer button to insert a new layer on the Timeline.
 
2. If the Deco tool isn’t active, select the Deco tool from the Tools panel.
 
3. On the Property inspector, select Symmetry Brush from the Drawing 
Effect drop-down list.
 
4. To the right of Module, click the Edit button.
 
5. From the Swap Symbol dialog box that appears, select a symbol from 
your library to use with the Symmetry Brush and then click OK.
 
6. On the stage, click and drag to begin drawing with the Symmetry 
Brush.
 
 The symbol you chose is duplicated in a rotating pattern around your 
brush point. Release the mouse button to stop drawing.
 
 The new pattern displays two handles — one to adjust pattern size, and 
one to adjust the distance between each symbol.

Understanding Frames and Keyframes

7. Move your cursor over the top of the vertical handle until you see a 
black arrow; click and drag to readjust the size of the pattern.
 
8. Move your cursor over the end of the horizontal handle until you see a 
black arrow; click and drag clockwise or counter-clockwise to reduce or 
increase the distance between symbol instances, respectively.
If you look at the Advanced Options for the Symmetry Brush (on the bottom 
of the Property inspector), you’ll see quite a few other interesting modes 
that let you reflect symbols or reconfigure them into a grid. Experiment with 
these and try different symbols from your library for contrast.
Understanding Frames and Keyframes
The Timeline, located above the stage, is where your animation is created. 
It’s important to take a detailed look at the components that make the 
Timeline tick: frames, keyframes, and the playhead.
The Timeline is composed of a series of consecutive frames (see Figure 3-7), 
each of which represents a point in time (much like a historical timeline). 
When the Flash Player plays your movie, the playhead moves from left to 
right across the Timeline. The playhead is represented by a red vertical line 
in your Timeline window. The numbers above the Timeline represent spe-
cific frame numbers.
 
Figure 3-7: 
The Timeline
is composed 
of frames 
and 
keyframes.  
Playhead
Keyframe
Frame number
Think of historical milestones represented at specific points on a Timeline 
with prominent markers. On a Flash Timeline, significant events (such as the 
beginning and end of an animation sequence) are represented as keyframes.
Every time you want to place a graphic, animation, or sound, first create a 
keyframe at the specific point on the Timeline where you want it to occur. 
When you create a new document, a single keyframe is automatically 
created on frame 1. Keyframes look like standard frames, except with a 
hollow or black circle inside.

Creating Animation with Motion and Shape Tweens
691
Add more keyframes as necessary to create animations or have graphics 
appear and disappear at specific points along the Timeline.
Creating Animation with Motion and Shape Tweens
When you understand the basics of the Timeline (see preceding section), 
you’re ready to create your first animation. The good news is that Flash does 
a lot of the hard work for you!
Flash can automatically create animation sequences from nothing more than 
a starting point and an ending point, figuring out everything in between. This 
type of animation is a tween. Motion and shape are the two types of tweens.
Creating a motion tween
A motion tween is a type of Flash-generated animation that requires the use 
of symbols and is best for creating movement, size, and rotation changes, 
fades, and color effects. All you need to do is tell Flash where to change 
the appearance of a symbol instance, and it fills in the blanks in between to 
create an animation sequence.
 
Only one object can be tweened on one layer at a time. If you want to tween 
several objects simultaneously, each object needs to occupy its own layer 
and have its own tween applied.
To create a motion tween, follow these steps:
 
1. Drag a symbol from your library to the stage to a new layer.
 
 The symbol is added to frame 1. For example, we positioned the symbol 
on the left edge of the stage, which is where the motion will begin.
 
2. Right-click the first frame of the layer that your symbol is on and 
choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu that appears.
 
 A shaded span of frames appears on the Timeline, called a tween span, 
and the layer is converted to a tween layer.
 
 To create animation, you can now move the playhead to different points 
along the tween span and make changes to your object’s appearance or 
position.
 
3. Drag the playhead to a new frame and then reposition your symbol.
 
 For this example, we dragged to frame 15 and repositioned the symbol 
in the middle of the stage.
 
 A new keyframe (which appears as a bullet point) has been created 
automatically at this frame to mark the change.

Creating Animation with Motion and Shape Tweens
692
 
4. Drag the playhead to another frame and move the symbol instance to 
another location on the stage, as shown in Figure 3-8.
 
 For this example, we dragged to frame 24 and repositioned the symbol 
on the left side of the stage.
 
 In addition to another keyframe, a motion path is created on the stage to 
show the path of animation that the symbol will take.
 
5. Press Enter/Return to play the Timeline and preview your animation.
 
 For the motion tween we created, the symbol moves from left to right.
 
 To see all frames of your animation at once, select the Onion Skin option 
underneath the Timeline. This option lets you select and show several 
frames at once so that you see the frames that the Flash tween has created 
for you.
You’re just scratching the surface of what Flash can do; feel free to experi-
ment further with different symbols and positions, and alter the length of 
your animations by placing starting and ending keyframes closer together or 
farther apart.

Resizing tween spans
If you want a tween to play out longer or shorter, or have more time for 
additional keyframes and motion, you can expand the number of frames in a 
tween span. By default, the length of each new tween span is based on your 
frame rate. A frame rate of 24 fps (frames per second) creates a 24-frame 
tween span each time, a frame rate of 30 fps creates a 30-frame tween span, 
and so on.
To expand or trim a tween span, follow these steps:
 
1. Locate and select a tween span on the Timeline and select the last 
frame in the span.
 
2. Move your cursor over the last frame of the span until a double-arrow 
icon appears.
 
3. Click and drag left or right to trim or lengthen the span, respectively.
 
If you resize a tween span after animation already has been created, existing 
keyframes will shift from their original positions on the Timeline. This will 
cause certain animations to begin or end at different times than you origi-
nally intended.
Using the new Motion Editor panel
Flash CS4 features a brand new Motion Editor panel, which gives you precise 
control over each aspect of a motion tween. The Motion Editor displays the 
various properties of a motion tween (such as motion, scale, and transpar-
ency) in a graph-style format that you can use to edit or add to your anima-
tions. You can use the Motion Editor only on motion tween spans; it can’t 
be used to modify shape tweens or classic tweens (motion tweens created in 
Flash CS3 or earlier).
The Motion Editor can be found behind the Timeline panel at the bottom of 
your default workspace.
Follow these steps to modify a motion tween with the Motion Editor:
 
1. Clicking the Motion Editor tab (you can find it behind the Timeline 
panel) to bring the Motion Editor panel forward.
 
2. Select a tweened object on the stage; you can click either the object or 
the motion path to select the tween.
 
 The Motion Editor displays each property as a row with a graph line 
running through it, as shown in Figure 3-9. The graph line represents the 
changes in a property value (such as scaling percentage) throughout the 
course of a tween span.

Creating Animation with Motion and Shape Tweens
694
 
3. Locate a property that your tween is using, such as Alpha, X, or Y, and 
click the row’s title to expand it.
 
 Along each line you’ll find points, or keyframes, that mark changes in the 
value of that property at different points in time.
 
4. Select a keyframe and drag it up or down to change the value of the 
current property.
 
5. Move your pointer over a different portion of the line. While holding 
down the Ctrl key (Windows) or the Ô key (Mac), click directly on the 
line to create a new point (or keyframe).
 
 Drag this point up or down to change the property’s value at this position.
 
6. Press the Enter/Return key to play back your Timeline and see how 
your modifications have affected the current tween.
Creating a shape tween
It’s easy to see how Flash can open up new worlds for creating quick, sleek 
animation without too much effort. After experimenting with motion tweens 
(see the preceding sections), you may find working with symbols a bit limit-
ing, especially if your goal is to modify the shape of an object from start to 
finish, such as morphing a star into a circle. In this case, you’d want to take 
advantage of shape tweens.

Chapter 3
Symbols and 
Animation
Creating Animation with Motion and Shape Tweens
695
For the most part, shape tweens are created in a very similar manner to 
motion tweens. However, unlike motion tweens, shape tweens must use raw 
shapes instead of symbols.
In addition to morphing between distinctively different shapes, shape 
tweens can morph color. Like motion tweens, you can tween only one shape 
at a time on a single layer. If you want to create multiple shape tweens simul-
taneously, isolate each one on its own layer.
Follow these steps to create a shape tween:
 
1. Create a new Flash document. At the bottom of the workspace, click 
the Timeline panel’s tab to bring it forward.
 
2. On an empty layer, draw a shape (for example, a star or polygon with 
the Polystar tool) on frame 1.
 
 You can include a stroke and a fill, as the shape tween can handle both.
 
3. Create a blank keyframe on frame 30 by choosing Insert➪Timeline➪
Blank Keyframe.
 
 As opposed to the motion tween, we choose a blank keyframe here 
because we don’t want a copy of the shape drawn on frame 1 to be car-
ried over to the new keyframe.
 
4. Draw a distinctively different shape on the new blank keyframe on 
frame 30.
 
5. Select frame 1 and choose Insert➪Shape Tween.
 
 You see an arrow and green shaded area appear between the starting 
and ending keyframes, indicating that you’ve successfully created a 
shape tween.
 
6. Turn on the Onion Skin Outlines option below the Timeline (see 
Figure 3-10) to see the frames that Flash has created for you.
 
7. Press Enter/Return to play back your animation.
 
 You now see the original shape transform into the final shape.

Tweened versus Frame-by-Frame Animation
696
Try creating a tween between two type characters with the preceding steps. 
Create the letters using the Text tool. Break the characters into their raw 
forms before creating a shape tween by choosing Modify➪Break Apart.
Tweened versus Frame-by-Frame Animation
If you come from a traditional animation background, you may want to 
create animation the old-fashioned way: frame-by-frame. Flash easily sup-
ports this method, but it’s best to decide which method you want to use 
based on what type of animation you want to create.
There are advantages to both methods: Although motion and shape tweens 
give you the power to create sleek animations quickly and easily, you may 
find they’re limited. Frame-by-frame animation is significantly more time-
consuming and complex to create but can afford some detail and flexibility 
that you can’t otherwise achieve.
To create a frame-by-frame animation, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a blank keyframe for each frame you want to include in your 
animation.
 
 Frames don’t have to be consecutive; you can leave space between key-
frames to control the time that elapses between each.
 
2. Draw (or insert) a graphic for each state of your animation on the 
appropriate keyframes.
 
3. Play back your animation by pressing the Enter/Return key.
In Chapter 4 of this minibook, you explore advanced animation techniques 
using Flash’s new IK and Armature features, which allow you to create 
sophisticated animation with the ease of tweens, but the complexity of 
frame-by-frame animation.
 
If your goal is to simply move an object from one location to another, create 
fades, or transform size and rotation, it makes sense to use motion tweens 
and let Flash do the thinking for you. If you’re trying to create highly com-
plex animations that tweens can’t handle (for example, a person running), 
you may want to try the more traditional frame-by-frame approach.
In some cases, you can break your artwork into individual moving parts (like 
wheels on a bicycle) across several layers to achieve similar affects to frame-
by-frame by using motion tweens. You can explore these further in the next 
chapter.

Understanding Frame Rate
697
Understanding Frame Rate
Frame rate plays an important part in the performance and appearance of 
your Flash movie. It dictates how many frames are played back per second by 
the Flash Player, in turn affecting the speed and smoothness of your animations.
You can modify frame rate in three ways:
 
✦ Choose Modify➪Document.
 
✦ With nothing on the stage selected, use the Property inspector. You’ll 
see your document properties.
 
✦ Click and drag over the frame rate value displayed at the bottom of 
the Timeline panel.
 
Frame rate is completely based upon the result you’re trying to achieve. 
Although the default frame rate in Flash is 24 fps (frames per second), you 
may also want to consider something around 30 fps, which is consistent with 
broadcast/digital video frame rates and should provide a good starting point 
for smooth, consistent animation. To keep things in perspective, keep in mind 
that a film projector (like the one at your local movie theater) runs at 24 fps.
If you want to increase the overall speed and smoothness of your animation, 
you can try increasing the frame rate gradually until you find the one that’s 
right for you. Flash can support frame rates of up to 120 fps.
 
Changing frame rate affects the playback of your entire movie. If you’re 
trying to adjust the speed of one specific animation, consider modifying the 
tween itself.

W
ith motion and shape tweens, creative animation possibilities are 
limited only by your imagination. You’ll no doubt want to explore 
what’s possible, and in this chapter, you get started with some popular ani-
mation effects, such as fades and transformations. In addition, we show you 
how to use new features, such as Inverse Kinematics (IK), which give you 
new and unprecedented abilities to create sophisticated animation with less 
effort.
Creating Transformations
Some of the most common effects, such as zooms, flips, leans, and spins, are 
all different types of transformations, or changes to a symbol’s dimensions, 
rotation, or skew. You can perform transformations on a symbol from the 
Tools panel, Transform panel, or Modify menu, and combine transforma-
tions for many animation possibilities.
Follow these steps to create a zoom-in effect:
 
1. On the first frame of a new layer, create an interesting shape on the 
stage with one of the Shape tools.
 
2. With the shape selected, choose Modify➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears.

Creating Transformations
700
 
3. Enter a name for the symbol in the Name text box, (for example, type 
Zoom Shape), choose Graphic from the Type drop-down list, and click OK.
 
 The symbol is added to your library and is ready to be used as part of a 
motion tween.
 
4. Select the first keyframe; right-click and choose Create Motion Tween 
from the contextual menu that appears.
 
 A new tween span is created on the layer. If you’re working with the 
default frame rate of 24 fps, the tween span should be exactly 24 frames 
long, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
5. Click the frame ruler above the Timeline at frame 24 to reposition the 
playhead at this point.
 
6. Choose Window➪Transform to open the Transform panel. With the 
Transform panel, enter 300% in the Scale Width and Scale Height text 
boxes.
 
 A new keyframe is created automatically at frame 24 within the tween 
span — this marks the change in scaling you’ve just made.
 
7. Press Enter/Return to play your movie.
 
 The smaller instance slowly tweens into the larger one, creating the illu-
sion that you’re zooming in closer to the object.

The zoom-out effect is identical to the animation you just created, but in 
reverse. Rather than starting with the smaller symbol instance, you start 
with the larger one and gradually pull away by tweening into the smaller 
one. Instead of creating a new animation, you can copy and reverse the exist-
ing one using a few handy shortcuts from the Timeline menu, which appears 
when you right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) a frame.
To duplicate and reverse the existing tween, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click your tween span directly on the Timeline and choose Copy 
Frames from the contextual menu that appears.
 
2. Select the next empty frame on the same layer.
 
 If your tween span is 24 frames long, this will be frame 25.
 
3. Right-click and choose Paste Frames from the contextual menu that 
appears.
 
 A copy of your tween span is pasted back-to-back with the existing one.
 
4. Right-click the new tween span, and choose Reverse Keyframes from 
the contextual menu that appears.
 
5. Click frame 1 and then press Enter/Return to play back your animation.
 
 The zoom-in effect will play, followed immediately by the exact reverse 
(zoom-out).
Joining Motion
The beauty of the new tween engine is that you no longer need to create 
several tweens or keyframes to have lots of different motion changes. You 
can create several different movements, transformations, and color effects 
sequentially within a single tween span.
On occasion, you may end up with two or more tween spans back-to-back. 
This is true if you copy and paste tween spans, as described in the previous 
section. You can, however, easily join tweens together into a single span for 
easier editing and tweaking.
Follow these steps to join multiple tween spans together:
 
1. While holding down the Shift key, click and select two or more con-
secutive tween spans on a single layer.
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) any of the selected 
tweens and then choose Join Motions from the contextual menu that 
appears.
 
 The tween spans are now joined together as one. You can now edit the 
tween span as a whole directly on the Timeline or with the Motion Editor.

Creating Fade Ins and Fade Outs
702
 
You can undo joined motion by choosing Split Motion from the Timeline’s 
contextual menu.
Creating Fade Ins and Fade Outs
Fade effects are very popular because they can add a cinematic feel to 
images, text, and graphics. You can see fades used in familiar media, such as 
photo slideshows or film, where images or scenes fade from one to another.
In Flash, fades are a type of basic color transformation that you can apply to 
any symbol by modifying its transparency, or alpha.
To create a fade in, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Layer icon at the bottom of the Timeline to create a new 
layer; select the Type tool and create some text on the new layer.
 
 Use no more than two words with a font size of 24 points. You can set 
the type size and style from the Property inspector’s Character options 
when the Type tool is active, so make sure that the panel is visible by 
choosing Window➪Properties.
 
2. Select the type with the Selection tool and convert it to a graphic 
symbol by choosing Modify➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 This step adds the type to the library as a symbol and makes it available 
for tweening.
 
3. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the first keyframe of the 
current layer and choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual 
menu that appears.
 
 A new tween span is created, and the playhead moves ahead to the end 
of the tween span.
 
4. Grab the playhead and drag it back to frame 1. With the Selection 
tool, click the new symbol once to select it.
 
5. In the Property inspector’s Color Effects section, choose Alpha from 
the Style drop-down list.
 
6. Use the slider or text box to set the alpha of the symbol instance to 0 
percent.
 
 The symbol becomes fully transparent and seems to disappear. (Don’t 
worry; it’s still there!)
 
7. Click frame 24 in the Timeline; with the Selection tool, select the 
symbol.

8. In the Property inspector, choose Alpha from the Style drop-down list 
and then use the slider or text box to set the alpha to 100 percent.
 
9. Press Enter/Return to play the movie.
 
 The text appears to fade in from nowhere onto the stage!
Very much like your zoom-out effect, the fade out is simply a reverse of a 
fade in. You can use the Timeline menu’s Reverse Frames command to turn 
your fade in into a fade out as follows:
 
1. Select the tween span that contains your fade in.
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) anywhere on the selected 
frames to open the contextual menu and choose Reverse Keyframes.
 
 The action reverses the animation so that the symbol starts out fully 
opaque.
 
3. Press Enter/Return to play the movie.
 
 The text you created now fades out on the stage.
 
Try duplicating and then reversing the fade-in tween to have the text fade in 
and then out.
Copying and Pasting Motion
A recent addition to Flash is the ability to copy the behavior of a motion 
tween and then paste it to a completely different symbol instance. This tech-
nique is handy if you need to have multiple objects follow the same exact 
animation behavior, such as birds of different colors and sizes all following 
the same flight pattern.
To copy and paste motion, you need an existing tween to copy from and then 
a symbol instance on a different layer to copy to. The following steps show 
you how to copy animation behavior from one tween that you can paste and 
apply to a different symbol afterwards:
 
1. Select an existing tween span on your Timeline, right-click (Windows) 
or Control-click (Mac), and then choose Copy Motion from the contex-
tual menu that appears.
 
2. On a new layer, place an instance of a symbol from your library.
 
 It can be the same symbol you’ve already tweened or a completely dif-
ferent symbol.

Animating along a Path with Motion Guides

3. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the first keyframe of the 
new layer, and choose Paste Motion from the contextual menu that 
appears.
 
 A new tween span is created.
 
4. Press Enter/Return to play your movie.
 
 The new symbol instance animates in the same way as the original 
object from which its motion was copied.
 
You can work with two instances of the same symbol, but the beauty of 
this feature is that you can copy and paste animation between completely 
nonrelated symbol instances. You can also paste motion between symbol 
instances that have drastically different size, color, and rotation properties.
Animating along a Path with Motion Guides
The motion tweens described earlier in the chapter have involved simple 
animation from one location to another. For some tweens, you’ll want to 
have your symbol follow a more elaborate path of motion, such as a race car 
following a track. For these cases, you can give your tween a specific path to 
follow by creating a custom motion path.
Experienced Flash users may notice the absence of the Add Motion Guide 
button below the Timeline. Because the animation engine has been com-
pletely revised, the process of creating motion guides no longer requires a 
separate layer. You can now modify or replace the motion paths that are cre-
ated automatically with each new tween span.
Snap to it: The importance of snapping
Snapping is an essential part of your workflow 
and can very often make positioning items on 
the stage much easier and more accurate. 
Snapping is like turning on a magnet; when you 
drag an object, it jumps to the closest guide, 
path, or object that it finds on the stage, depend-
ing on what type of snapping you’ve enabled. 
Snapping is great for lining up objects with each 
other, for positioning artwork on a ruler guide, 
and especially for positioning a symbol on the 
beginning or end of a motion guide path.
By default, snapping is enabled for alignment, 
guides, and objects. Additionally, you can 
choose View➪Snapping➪Snap to Grid (when 
working with a grid) or View➪Snapping➪Snap 
to Pixels, which makes sure that objects are 
positioned on the stage to the nearest whole 
pixel.
You can find snapping options by choos-
ing View➪Snapping, and you can also 
fine-tune snapping behavior by choosing 
View➪Snapping➪Edit Snapping.

Motion guides are especially useful when you work with a shape that has an 
obvious orientation (or direction, such as the nose of a car or an airplane). 
For this reason, make sure you use a symbol with an obvious orientation as 
your tweened object in the following steps:
 
1. Create a new layer on the Timeline and place or create a new graphic 
symbol on the layer.
 
2. With the Selection tool, select the entire graphic and press the F8 
shortcut key to convert it to a symbol.
 
3. When the Convert to Symbol dialog box appears, choose Graphic from 
the Type drop-down list and enter a name for the symbol in the Name 
text box.
 
4. Create another new layer on the Timeline, select the Pencil tool in the 
Tools panel, and select a stroke color from the Property inspector on 
the right.
 
 Note: Make sure that Object Drawing mode is OFF. This button can be 
found on the bottom of the Tools panel when the Pencil tool is selected.
 
5. Draw a path on the stage with the Pencil tool, as shown in Figure 4-2.

6. Switch to the Selection tool and double-click the path you just created.
 
7. Choose Edit➪Cut to remove it from the stage temporarily.
 
8. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) frame 1 of the layer 
which contains your symbol and choose Create Motion Tween from 
the contextual menu that appears.
 
 A new tween span is created for your triangle symbol.

9. Choose Edit➪Paste in Place to paste the path you created earlier.
 
 Flash automatically converts it to a motion path, and your symbol snaps 
to the path, as shown in Figure 4-3.

10. Press Enter/Return to play your movie.
 
 The symbol follows the path you created. Next, you can tweak the tween 
so that the symbol follows the exact orientation of the path.
 
11. Select frame 1 of your tween span; on the Property inspector, locate 
and select the Orient to Path check box (it’s located under the 
Rotation options).
 
12. Press Enter/Return again to play your movie and you’ll see that the 
symbol now changes rotation to match the direction of the path.
 
Starting your symbol off on the right foot often helps get better results when 
using Orient to Path. If the symbol orientation isn’t what you expect, try 
rotating the symbol in the right direction at both the beginning and ending 
frames of the tween span.
 
Be cautious of paths that overlap themselves; the results may not be what 
you expect!

Creating Inertia and Gravity with Easing
707
Creating Inertia and Gravity with Easing
When objects take motion in real life, several factors affect their speed as 
they move. Take the example of a ball bouncing up and down on a side-
walk: When the ball hits the ground and bounces, it loses speed as it moves 
upward because gravity pulls it back toward the ground. When the ball 
changes direction and moves back downward, increased gravity makes it 
pick up speed as it nears the ground again.
You can reproduce the two most recognizable forces, inertia and gravity, by 
using a special tween option — Ease. The new animation engine makes lots 
of easing behaviors available, including Bounce, Spring, Ease In (speed up), 
Ease Out (slow down), and more. You can assign easing to any tween span 
with the Motion Editor.
To create an easing behavior, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Oval tool and on a new layer, create a perfect circle at the 
bottom of the stage.
 
 Hold down the Shift key to constrain the circle while you draw it.
 
2. With the new circle selected, press the F8 keyboard shortcut; when the 
Convert to Symbol dialog box appears, choose Graphic from the Type 
drop-down list and enter a name for the symbol in the Name text box.
 
 In this example, we named the circle Ball.
 
3. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the first frame of the 
layer and choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu that 
appears.
 
 A new tween span is created, and the playhead advances to the last 
frame of the tween span.
 
4. With the Selection tool, select and move the symbol straight up to the 
top of the stage while leaving its horizontal position the same (see 
Figure 4-4).
 
 Drag the symbol slowly toward the top of the stage to keep it from shift-
ing left or right. The Snap to Objects behavior keeps the symbol aligned 
with its original horizontal position until you release it.
 
5. Press Enter/Return to preview the animation.
 
 The Ball should now move from the bottom to the top of the stage.

6. Click directly on the tween span on the Timeline to select it and then 
click the Motion Editor’s panel tab to bring it forward.
 
 You see the various properties of your tween represented on the Motion 
Editor panel.
 
7. Scroll to the bottom of the Motion Editor, locate the Eases row, and 
change the Simple (slow) value from 0 to 100.
 
 You can click and drag over the value to change it, or double-click and 
enter the value by hand.
 
 You see the default Simple (slow) ease is already listed. You can add 
other types of eases to use later on, but for now, the default will do fine.
 
 Changing the value creates an Ease Out, which slows the animation as it 
comes to completion.
 
8. Scroll up to the top of your Motion Editor and locate the Basic Motion 
row; directly to the right, choose Simple (slow) from the drop-down list.
 
 This applies the ease to the motion properties of your tween.
 
9. Press Enter/Return to play back and preview your animation.
 
 The animation slows down gradually as it reaches completion.

Fine-Tuning Shape Tweens with Shape Hinting
709
You can see how easing affects the speed of the tween as it progresses, and 
now a simple animation becomes much more lifelike. However, what goes up 
must come down, so the following steps walk you through making the Ball 
return to the ground:
 
1. Click the Timeline tab and then click directly on the layer anywhere 
within the tween span to select the entire motion tween.
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the selected frames to 
open the contextual menu and choose Copy Frames.
 
3. On the same layer, select the next empty frame right after the tween 
span ends.
 
4. With the frame selected, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) 
and choose Paste Frames from the contextual menu that appears to 
paste the tween you copied in Step 2.
 
5. Click the newly pasted tween span to select it.
 
6. Right click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the selected frames and 
choose Reverse Keyframes from the contextual menu that appears to 
flip the tween backward.
 
7. Press Enter/Return to preview your animation.
 
 The Ball now goes up and then down, and conveniently the animation is 
not only reversed, but so is easing.
Fine-Tuning Shape Tweens with Shape Hinting
Chapter 3 of this minibook explores the possibilities of morphing shape 
and color with shape tweens. Flash does a great job of recalculating shapes 
during a tween, but sometimes you need to give it a little help, especially 
when you have two shapes that have common features. Flash may overthink 
things and perform more shape morphing than it has to. For these cases, 
you can use shape hints — sets of matched markers that can tell Flash that 
two points on two different shapes are related. You can attach shape hints 
to the outlines of shapes on the starting and ending frames of a shape tween 
to let Flash know what common points exist between the two.
A good example of related shapes are the letters F and T. The two letters 
have many common angles. A shape tween between the two is a great way to 
make use of shape hints.
Before you get started, create a new document. Select the Type tool and, 
with the Property inspector, set the font style to Arial Black (or equivalent) 
and set the font size to 200. Then follow these steps:

Fine-Tuning Shape Tweens with Shape Hinting
710
 
1. On the first frame of a new layer, type F in the middle of the stage.
 
2. Select the letter with the Selection tool and choose Modify➪Break 
Apart to break the type down to its raw outlines.
 
3. On frame 20 of the same layer, create a new blank keyframe with the 
F7 keyboard shortcut.
 
4. Type T on the new keyframe and position it in the same place as the F 
on the first frame.
 
 You can use the Property inspector to match the X and Y positions, if 
necessary.
 
5. Break the T apart by choosing Modify➪Break Apart.
 
6. Create a shape tween by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking 
(Mac) the first frame and choosing Create Shape Tween from the con-
textual menu that appears.
 
 An arrow and green shaded area appear, indicating that the tween was 
created successfully.
 
7. Press Enter/Return to preview your movie.
 
 The F morphs into the T.
Even though the shape tween was successful, the outcome may not have 
been what you expected. Chances are the F seems to get mashed up (instead 
of a smooth transition) before being completely reconstructed into the T 
because Flash can’t see the common angles between the two shapes (even 
though you can). That’s where shape hints come in. You can add shape hints 
to suggest common points to Flash and smooth out the tween.
Before you get started, make sure that Snap to Objects is enabled by choosing 
View➪Snapping➪Snap to Objects. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Select frame 1 of your shape tween and choose View➪Show Shape 
Hints to turn on shape hinting.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Shape➪Add Shape Hint to create a new shape hint on 
the stage.
 
 A red button, labeled with the letter a, appears.
 
3. Repeat Step 2 to add another shape hint.
 
 This time, the shape hint appears labeled with the letter b.
 
 Sometimes shape hints stack on top of each other; move one to reveal 
the others underneath if only one is visible.

4. Position the two shape hints on the outline of the F.
 
 To do so, move shape hint (b) over just a bit so that you can see shape 
hint (a). Then move (a) and snap it to the lower-left corner of the F. 
Position the second shape hint (b) in the upper-left corner of the F.
 
5. Select frame 20.
 
 You see the companions to the shape hints you created, waiting to be 
positioned.
 
6. Position shape hints (a) and (b).
 
 This step matches the bottom-left and top-left corners of the T to the 
ones in F, and the buttons turn green to indicate a successful match.
 
7. Press Enter/Return to preview your animation.
 
 If you watch carefully, you see that the shape hints are keeping those 
two corners anchored while the rest of the shape transforms, creating a 
smoother transition.
Note: Like motion guides, shape hints don’t appear in your final, published 
movie.
 
Add Shape Hints with the shortcut key combination: Shift+Ctrl+H (Windows) 
or Shift+Ô+H (Mac).
You can also add some remaining hints to finalize your tween by following 
these steps:
 
1. Select frame 1 of your shape tween and make sure that shape hints 
are still visible by choosing View➪Show Shape Hints.
 
 If they’re already enabled, you see a check mark.
 
2. Create one new shape hint with the keyboard shortcut Shift+Ctrl+H 
(Windows) or Shift+Ô+H (Mac).
 
 The shape hint is automatically labeled with the letter c.
 
3. Position the (c) shape hint on the F (see Figure 4-5) on the top-right 
corner.
 
4. Select frame 20 and you see the companion to the new shape hint 
waiting to be placed.
 
5. Position the shape hint on the T to match the angle you marked on the F.
 
6. Press Enter/Return to play your animation.
 
 You see that the shape hints have provided a much smoother transition 
from what you initially started with.

Figure 4-5:

Shape hints have their own contextual menu that appears when you right-
click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) on any shape hint on the first frame 
of a shape tween. To clear a selected shape hint, choose Remove Shape Hint 
or choose Remove All Hints to clear all hints on the stage and start over.
 
While it’s often not necessary to add more than a handful of shape hints, you 
may be wondering: What is the maximum number of shape hints allowed? 
The answer is 26 — the exact amount of letters in the alphabet. Once Flash 
runs out of letters to label shape hints, it won’t allow you to create any addi-
tional ones.
Creating Inverse Kinematics Poses and Animation
A significant new addition for designers and animators is Flash’s support for 
Inverse Kinematics (IK), a principle relied upon in 3D and computer anima-
tion and modeling. Inverse Kinematics determines how jointed or connected 
objects position themselves relative to one another when moved.
For example, when animating a human arm, if the forearm changes position, 
it ultimately affects the position of the connected hand and upper arm. It’s 
these principles that help create life-like animation and interaction.
 
 Flash adds two new tools, the Bone tool and the Bind tool, that you’ll use to 
connect objects together and edit those connections. Connected objects can 
be posed, and changes between those poses can ultimately be animated. 
You can create IK relationships between symbol instances or shapes.

To create and connect IK container objects, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new Flash document, and place two symbol instances on a 
new layer.
 
 These can be instances of the same symbol or of two different symbols.
 
2. Select the Bone tool from the Tools panel, move your pointer over the 
first object until a plus sign appears, drag until the cursor is over the 
second object, and release the mouse button, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
 This draws a virtual bone between the two shapes, connecting them 
together.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Drag the 
Bone tool to 
draw virtual 
bones that 
connect two 
shapes or 
symbols.
 
 
 You’ve now converted the two symbol instances to IK container objects, 
and the layer’s been converted to an Armature layer.
 
3. Choose the Selection tool and drag either of the connected symbols to 
see how the connected objects will behave.
 
 The second symbol changes its position based on the position of the 
first.
You can add more objects to the chain. Although you can’t add objects ran-
domly to an Armature layer, you can connect existing IK container objects to 
artwork on other layers to add them to the chain.
Follow these steps to add objects to an existing Armature layer:

Creating Inverse Kinematics Poses and Animation
714
 
1. Create a new layer on the Timeline and drag a symbol instance to it 
from the Library panel.
 
 Position the symbol where you want it relative to the existing IK con-
tainer objects on the stage.
 
2. Choose the Selection tool and select the object in the existing 
Armature layer that you want to connect the new symbol to.
 
3. Choose the Bone tool, locate the joint (or connection point) on the 
selected IK container object, and click and drag from that point to the 
new symbol.
 
 A new bone is drawn to connect the two objects together, and the 
symbol is removed from its original layer and added to the Armature 
layer.
 
4. Choose the Selection tool and drag the new symbol around to see how 
its motion affects the other objects in the chain.
Creating animation with poses
After you create a series of connected IK objects, you can put them into 
motion with poses. Poses capture different positions of your IK objects, 
and Flash can animate from pose-to-pose to create sophisticated animation 
sequences.
After an Armature layer is created, poses can be inserted (much like key-
frames) to note different points along the Timeline where a new pose will be 
created.
To create and animate poses, follow these steps:
 
1. Click and select an empty frame on an existing Armature layer (for 
example, frame 15).
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the selected frame and 
choose Insert Pose from the contextual menu that appears, as shown 
in Figure 4-7.
 
 A new keyframe is created here, where you can re-pose the IK objects.
 
 Very much like a keyframe, a pose lets you change the position of IK 
objects at a specific point on the Timeline.
 
3. Choose the Selection tool and reposition the connected objects on 
your Armature layer to create a unique pose, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
4. Press Enter/Return to play back the Timeline.
 
 Flash creates an animation to transition from one pose to the next!

Using Mask Layers
716
Adding easing to Armature layers
Just as with motion tweens, you can mimic the forces of gravity and inertia 
using easing with IK animations. Although the Motion Editor isn’t available 
for posed animation, you can easily add easing behavior from the Property 
inspector to give your IK animation a more realistic look and feel.
Follow these steps to add easing to an Armature layer:
 
1. Click and select the first frame of an existing IK Armature layer on the 
Timeline.
 
2. Locate the Ease options on the Property inspector on the right — the 
default value is set to zero (no ease) — and then click and drag to 
change the value to 100 (Ease Out).
 
3. (Optional) Select another type of ease from the Type drop-down list.
 
4. Press Enter/Return to view the animation.
 
 You see the easing change the behavior of your animation.
Using Mask Layers
The concept of masking involves using a shape (or shapes) to hide or reveal 
portions of a piece of artwork — working very much like a small window 
in your house. You can see only what the window allows you to see when 
you’re inside. Flash features a special type of layer, known as a mask, and 
its contents are used to selectively reveal (or hide) artwork or animation on 
another layer.
You can convert any layer into a mask by using the Layer contextual menu, 
which is launched by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac) 
the layer’s name area. Artwork on a mask layer isn’t visible; the content of a 
mask layer always represents the visible area of the layer underneath.
Animated text is a great candidate for masking. The following steps take you 
through creating a tween to which you add a mask layer for added effect. 
Before you get started, create a new document and select the Type tool. 
Choose a stroke and fill color and then use your Property inspector to set 
the type face to Arial Black (or something similar) and the font size to 40. 
Then follow these steps:
 
1. On a new layer, select the Text tool and type a few words on the layer.
 
 For this example, we typed FLASH ROCKS in capital letters.
 
2. Switch to the Selection tool, and select the text. Choose 
Modify➪Convert to Symbol or press the F8 keyboard shortcut to con-
vert the text to a new graphic symbol.

3. In the Convert to Symbol dialog box, choose Graphic from the Type 
drop-down list and enter a name for the symbol in the Name text box.
 
4. Place the text off the stage to the left so that it’s sitting in the paste-
board area.
 
 You animate the text to bring it across the stage, entering from one side 
and exiting on the other.
 
5. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the layer that contains 
your text, and choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu 
that appears to create a new tween span.
 
 An instance of the text is created there as well.
 
6. Move your pointer over the last frame of the new tween span until 
you see the double arrows. Click and drag to extend the tween span to 
frame 40.
 
7. On frame 40, select the text and drag it all the way to the right side of 
the stage.
 
 A keyframe is created at frame 40, and this creates a tween that moves 
the text from left to right across the stage.
 
8. Insert a new layer above the tween layer and name it Mask; create a 
shape to use as your mask on this layer. Make sure that the shape is at 
least as tall as the text symbol you created.
 
 For example, we used the Polystar tool to create a star in the center 
of the stage. The Star option for the Polystar tool is available on the 
Property inspector under Options.
 
9. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the new layer name and 
choose Mask from the contextual menu that appears.
 
 The new layer is converted to a mask layer, and the tween layer appears 
indented underneath, as shown in Figure 4-9. Both layers are locked 
automatically.
 
10. Press Enter/Return to play your movie.
 
 The text animates, appearing through the shape (a star, in this exam-
ple), much like you’re viewing the animation through a window.
 
For the masking layer to take effect, both the mask layer and the layer being 
masked must be locked. To edit the contents of either layer, unlock the 
layers by clicking and removing the padlock icons on each layer.
 
Mask layers can contain just about anything a standard layer can, including 
tweens. Try creating a motion tween on your mask layer and see what 
happens!

Previewing Your Movie
Previewing your movie in the Flash Player to check its speed and size is 
a good idea. To view your movie in Preview mode, choose File➪Publish 
Preview➪Flash or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or 
Ô+Return (Mac).
This step creates an .swf file from your current authoring file and displays 
it immediately in the Flash Player. Previewing is a great way to see how your 
movie will actually appear to your users and can highlight any potential 
snags.
 
Ultimately, the final viewing environment for most Flash movies is on the 
Web in a browser, such as Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox. Part of what 
Flash creates for you at publish time isn’t only a finished .swf but also 
an HTML (HyperText Markup Language) page to contain your movie. To 
see how your movie looks as viewed in a browser, choose File➪Publish 
Preview➪Default (HTML). Your default system browser launches and pres-
ents your movie in a Web page, just as your user will see it.

Chapter 5: Importing Graphics 
and Sounds
In This Chapter
✓ Importing bitmap images and vector artwork
✓ Converting your bitmap images to symbols
✓ Importing Illustrator and Photoshop files
✓ Adding sounds to your movie
You may decide to enhance your Flash movies with the addition of 
photos or graphics created in other applications, such as Photoshop 
CS4 and Illustrator CS4. Flash natively supports Photoshop and Illustrator 
file format imports, as well as many popular image formats. Combine this 
feature with the ability to import and utilize .mp3 and other popular sound 
formats, and you can truly make your Flash movies an immersive multime-
dia experience.
Bitmap versus Vector Artwork
In computer-based design, you need to be aware of two graphic types: 
bitmap and vector. The drawing environment in Flash natively creates 
vector graphics, but you can use both bitmap and vector graphics in a Flash 
movie.
Vector graphics refer to scalable artwork consisting of points, paths, and fills 
that the computer creates based on mathematical formulas. While you may 
see a plain red rectangle, Flash sees an equation that creates the points, 
paths, and fill color necessary to re-create the graphic. Changing the rect-
angle’s size, position, or color is a matter of simply recalculating the formula 
and redrawing the shape. As a result, vector graphics maintain crisp qual-
ity even when scaled far beyond their original size. Flash (like its cousin 
Illustrator CS4) can natively create detailed vector illustrations and typogra-
phy that you can easily scale or modify.
Bitmap graphics are created very much like the picture on your TV set. If you 
ever looked closely at a tube television, you’ll see the picture is created from 
lots of multicolored, tightly arranged dots. The same is true of bitmap graph-
ics, which are created from many pixels of varying colors on your computer 
screen. The detail of the image can vary based on how many pixels, or dots, 
are used per inch to create the image. This amount is referred to as dpi, or dots 

Importing Other File Formats
720
per inch. Due to the immense range of colors and detail that bitmap images can 
re-create, they’re the format of choice for digital photographs and photo art. 
Flash doesn’t natively create bitmap graphics, but easily imports a variety of 
popular image formats and natively supports Photoshop (.psd) files.
 
Bitmap images are created with a certain amount of pixel data; rescaling 
the image means either eliminating that data or trying to create information 
where it didn’t exist before. For this reason, bitmaps are far more limited 
than vectors in terms of scalability and can lose quality quickly if scaled 
too far beyond their original size, as shown in Figure 5-1. In Figure 5-1, both 
stars are zoomed at 400 percent. The bitmap image begins to pixelate as you 
zoom in, revealing the pixels that create it.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Left: A star 
created 
with vector 
graphics. 
Right: The 
same star 
as a bitmap.
 
Importing Other File Formats
Your choice of file formats will be based on what applications you com-
monly work with. Flash supports many popular file formats, as well as 
industry-standard Photoshop and Illustrator file formats, giving you lots of 
flexibility. Flash doesn’t generate bitmap artwork, though, so you may ask 
yourself what format you should use to save photos, graphics, and type cre-
ated in other applications before you import them into Flash.
Flash supports and imports the following file formats:
 
✦ Illustrator (.ai)
 
✦ Photoshop (.psd)

Flash, like many Web-centric applications, works at screen resolution: 72 
dpi. Images at higher (or lower) resolutions are conformed to screen resolu-
tion upon import, and their sizes on the Flash stage may be different than 
what you expect.
Vector graphics, such as illustrations and typography, can be created in 
applications like Adobe Illustrator CS4. Artwork that contains layers should 
be saved natively as Illustrator (.ai) format because Flash can import and 
re-create those layers exactly as they were in the original document without 
loss of quality. You work with the Adobe Illustrator Import panel to view and 
distribute imported layers in the “Importing Photoshop and Illustrator Files” 
section in this chapter.
Bitmap graphics, such as photos, can be saved and imported in a variety 
of formats. If you’re working with a layered Photoshop document, you can 
import the document (.psd) directly into Flash with the new Photoshop 
Import panel. Like the Illustrator Import panel, you can view and choose how 
to distribute layers into Flash. Layer effects, such as drop shadows, are main-
tained, and where possible, they’re converted into their Flash equivalents.
Other popular formats include JPEG, GIF, and PNG:
 
✦ JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) can reproduce the wide range 
of color and detail necessary to reproduce photographs while keeping 
file size reasonable, and as such, are the best choice for photo-centric 
documents (see Figure 5-2).
 
✦ GIF (Graphics Interchange Format; see Figure 5-3) is a lightweight format 
with a limited color gamut (range) of 256 colors and is a good choice for 
reproducing crisp type, logos, and titling. GIF also supports transpar-
ency, so it’s a good choice when the graphics you need to import need 
to be placed discretely against varying backgrounds.
 
✦ PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format has capabilities that cross 
over between those of JPEGs and GIFs. PNG also supports transparency 
and opacity. Between the two PNG types (PNG-8 or PNG-24), you can 
reproduce both simple graphics and photos with depth and accuracy.
Ultimately, your choice of format depends on what type of graphics you’re 
working with and how they work in context with the rest of your Flash 
movie.

Importing Bitmap Images
When you need to make use of a photo or graphic file, such as JPEG, GIF, or 
PNG, import it into Flash by choosing File➪Import.
Imported bitmaps are added to your library as assets. Assets aren’t to be 
mistaken for symbols, which you can duplicate and manage from the library. 
Assets are simply non-Flash items that you import, store, and use through-
out your movie. Although bitmap assets can be converted to symbols, 
they’re not automatically converted upon import; you still need to add them 
as symbols (see Chapter 3 of this minibook).
To import a bitmap image, follow these steps:
 
1. In a new Flash document, choose File➪Import➪Import to Stage.
 
 The Import dialog box appears, asking you to find a file on your local 
computer.

 To import an image (or images) to the library for later use, such as a 
series of photos that will be used in a photo gallery, choose File➪
Import➪Import to Library. This command places the chosen images 
directly in the library so that you can use them when you’re ready.
 
2. Locate a bitmap file (such as a JPEG or a GIF) from your hard drive, 
select it, and click Open (Windows) or Import (Mac).
 
 The file is imported and placed on your stage on the currently active 
layer.
 
3. Locate and open your Library panel (choose Window➪Library), and 
you see that the bitmap has also been placed in your library.
 
If you try to import an image to the stage and the currently active layer is 
locked, the Import to Stage option will be unavailable (grayed out). In that 
case, choose a different, unlocked layer or unlock the currently active layer.
Converting Bitmap Images to Symbols
When the bitmap is on the stage or in the library, the image can be con-
verted to a symbol just like any other graphic on your stage. The process is 
the same, and the image inherits the same abilities that graphic symbols do, 
including tween ability, tint, transparency, and management from a master 
symbol in the library.
Follow these steps to convert a bitmap image to a symbol:
 
1. Choose an imported bitmap image from the library and drag it to the 
stage.
 
 If you already have a bitmap on the stage, select it with the Selection tool.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a name in the Name text box, choose Graphic from the Type 
drop-down list, and set the registration point using the grid.
 
 You can also convert bitmaps to buttons or movie clips by choosing 
Button or Movie Clip from the Type drop-down list.
 
4. Click OK to complete the conversion.
 
 Your bitmap image appears as a new graphic symbol in your library. 
You can now drag several instances to the stage and then tween and 
transform it.
 
Symbols created from imported bitmaps create dependencies and continue to 
reference the original raw bitmaps in the library. Deleting raw bitmap assets 
from the library causes them to disappear from any symbols that use them.

Converting Bitmap Images to Symbols
724
Modifying tint and transparency
After you convert a bitmap image to a symbol, you can apply the same 
transparency and color effects available to graphic symbols. To create these 
effects, use the Color drop-down list on the Property inspector, so make 
sure that your Property inspector is visible (choose Window➪Properties) 
before you get started.
Follow these steps to apply a color tint:
 
1. Drag a symbol from the Library panel onto the stage that uses an 
imported image.
 
2. Locate the Color Effect section of the Property inspector on the right; 
from the Style drop-down list, select Tint.
 
 A percentage slider and color swatch appear.
 
3. Click the swatch to choose a color from the Swatches panel and then 
adjust the amount of color applied using the percentage slider (see 
Figure 5-4).
Note: Flash remembers color settings, such as Tint and Alpha percentages 
between uses (see Figure 5-4). If you set an object to 50 percent alpha, the 
next time you select Alpha for a symbol, Flash automatically applies the 
same 50 percent setting again (which you can easily change with the slider).

Applying motion tweens
Any bitmap that’s been converted to a symbol can have motion tweens 
applied in the exact same way as you would with any other symbol.
When you’re working with symbols created from images, you open up cre-
ative options, such as cinematic fades, moving slideshows, and unique pre-
sentation ideas.
To create a motion tween with a bitmap image, follow these steps:
 
1. Drag an instance of a bitmap-based symbol to your stage from the 
Library panel onto a new, empty layer. Position it on the one side of 
the stage.
 
 For this example, we placed a symbol on the left side of the stage. The 
instance should be on frame 1 of the new layer.
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the first keyframe of the 
new layer and select Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu 
that appears.
 
 The playhead advances to the end of a new tween span (at the default 
frame rate, this is frame 24).
 
3. Position the symbol on the other side of the stage. Select the symbol 
once more and drag the playhead back to the beginning of the tween 
span at frame 1.
 
 We moved the symbol to the right side of the stage for this example.
 
4. With the Selection tool, click the symbol once to select it.
 
5. Locate the Style drop-down list in the Color Effect section on the 
Property inspector, choose Alpha, and set the percentage to 0%.
 
 The symbol is set to full transparency and disappears.
 
6. To make sure the symbol returns to full opacity later on, drag the 
playhead back to frame 24, and use the Alpha slider on the Property 
inspector to return the symbol’s opacity to 100%.
 
7. Press Enter/Return to play the animation.
 
 The image (symbol) appears to slide and fade in from the left side of the 
stage, as shown in Onion Skin view in Figure 5-5.
 
Figure 5-5: 
The image 
fades and 
flies in from 
the left.
 

Creating Bitmap Fills
726
Creating Bitmap Fills
As an alternative to solid colors or gradients, bitmap images can be used as 
fills for shapes, illustrations, and even type. Bitmap fills can create very cool 
effects and let you add interesting photographic textures to enhance your 
artwork.
You can create bitmap fills from existing bitmaps that have already been 
imported into your library, or you can use the Color panel to import a 
bitmap whenever you need to create a new bitmap fill.
Follow these steps to create a bitmap fill:
 
1. Create a shape on the stage, as shown in Figure 5-6; set a fill and 
stroke color with the swatches at the bottom of the Tools panel.
 
 To use a bitmap fill on type, you first have to break the type apart by 
choosing Modify➪Break Apart. Type is created and edited on a type 
path, so you need to break it off the path and down to its raw form 
(points and paths).
 
Figure 5-6: 
Create an 
interesting 
shape with 
the shape 
or drawing 
tools.
 
 
2. Select the shape with the Selection tool and choose Window➪Color to 
launch the Color panel.
 
3. Make the fill color active by clicking the Paint Bucket icon on the 
Color panel.
 
4. Locate the Type drop-down list and choose Bitmap.
 
 If you have no bitmaps in your library, choose a bitmap file from the 
Import to Library dialog box that appears.

Importing Photoshop and Illustrator Files

 Or, if you have bitmaps already in your library, a thumbnail preview of 
each appears at the bottom of the Color panel. Click the one you want to 
fill the shape with.
 
 The shape is now filled with the bitmap you chose (see Figure 5-7).
 
Figure 5-7: 
The imported
bitmap 
image 
fills the 
shape like 
a picture 
frame.
 
After you apply a bitmap fill, you may want to adjust the positioning and size 
of the bitmap within the fill area. Use the Gradient Transform tool (located 
underneath the Transform tool). Gradients and bitmap fills, although very 
different, both have a visible orientation point that you can adjust.
To position a bitmap fill, select the Gradient Transform tool and select a 
shape that uses a bitmap fill. Drag the center point of the circular bounding 
box that appears to reposition the bitmap, or use the outside handles to 
rotate, scale, and skew the bitmap.
Importing Photoshop and Illustrator Files
Flash offers seamless import of Photoshop and Illustrator files with the all-
new Illustrator and Photoshop Import panels. Graphics created in these 
applications can be imported with ease and the highest quality possible, 
which is great news if Photoshop and Illustrator are already essential parts 
of your creative workflow.
With the Import panels, you can view, select, and convert Photoshop layers 
to symbols or keyframes or distribute them to Flash layers while maintaining 
common layer effects, such as drop shadows and blurs. The ability to select 
individual layers means that you can use specific elements from .psd and .ai 
files without the need to bring in lots of unnecessary art from complex files.

Importing Photoshop and Illustrator Files

The Photoshop Import Options panel
The Photoshop Import Options panel gives you 
a detailed choice of what is imported and how 
from .psd files. You can send bitmap artwork 
directly to the library as assets or movie clips; 
type and vector layers can be converted or kept 
as editable paths or type layers.
Here’s a detailed look at what you see in this 
new panel:
 ✓ Select Photoshop Layer Comp: If your 
document contains Layer Comps, you can 
select one from this drop-down list. The 
layers and positioning that makes up the 
selected comp become active in the Layer 
view.
 ✓ Layers view: All layers in your .psd appear 
listed on the left side of the Import to Library 
panel, and you can choose which layers to 
import by selecting the check boxes to the 
left. Highlighting a layer displays its import 
options on the right.
 ✓ Merge Layers button: When more than 
one layer is highlighted, you can choose 
to merge the layers on import into a single 
layer, which has no effect on the original 
.psd.
 ✓ Convert Layers to Flash Layers or Convert 
Layers to Keyframes: Selecting the Flash 
Layers option keeps layer structure (as 
well as layer groups) and distributes layer 
contents exactly as they are in your .psd 
file. Selecting the Keyframes option distrib-
utes layer contents across a sequence of 
keyframes on the Timeline.
 ✓ Place Layers at Original Position: This 
check box (selected by default) positions 
layer contents exactly as they are in the 
original .psd.
 ✓ Set Stage to Same Size as Photoshop 
Canvas: Selecting this option resizes your 
movie to match the original size of the 
.psd file.
 ✓ Import This Image As: Selecting this option 
converts the layer contents to either a 
bitmap image with editable Flash filter 
effects (converted from Photoshop layer 
styles or a flattened bitmap image, which 
merges any applied layer styles along with 
the bitmap image).
 ✓ Editable Paths and Layer Styles (Shape 
Layers Only): You can keep shape layers 
and vector artwork editable in Flash by 
selecting this option, which places artwork 
on the stage as drawing objects.
 ✓ Editable Text (Type Layers Only): Selecting 
this option keeps imported text layers edit-
able, re-creating Photoshop type layers as 
Flash type layers.
 ✓ Vector Outlines (Type Layers Only): 
Selecting this option converts type layers 
into raw vector graphics (drawing objects). 
Type is no longer editable, but its outline 
can be manipulated with tools, such as the 
Subselection tool and Pen tool.
 ✓ Create Movie Clip for This Layer: Selecting 
this option converts the layer contents to a 
new movie clip symbol that’s also added to 
the library. You have the option of setting 
a registration point as well as an instance 
name. (See Chapter 7 of this minibook for 
more on instance names.)
 ✓ Publish settings: For each layer, you can 
set individual compression and quality 
settings or choose to use the document’s 
publish settings instead. A handy Calculate 
Bitmap Size button lets you see how your 
selected compression and quality settings 
affect the resulting file size of the imported 
content.

Importing Photoshop (.psd) files
Whether you need a simple photograph or complex compiled artwork, the 
Photoshop Import options make it easy to import any .psd file while keep-
ing individual layers editable, even with type and layer styles. You can dis-
tribute Photoshop layers to Flash layers, sequence them as keyframes, or 
individually convert layer contents to symbols that are added to the library.
Flash even supports Photoshop Layer Comps, so you can choose from and 
import any Layer Comp in your .psd file.
Before you begin, locate a Photoshop file that you want to import into Flash. 
A great example would be a file that combines layers, type, and basic use of 
Photoshop layer styles (such as drop shadows).
To import a Photoshop file, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Import➪Import to Stage.
 
2. When the Import dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-8, choose 
a Photoshop file from your hard drive and click Open (Windows) or 
Choose (Mac).
 
 The Import to Library dialog box appears with full Photoshop file import 
options and a full view of all layers in your file.
 
3. With the check boxes next to each layer, select the layers you want to 
import into Flash.
 
 Now, you can set options for how to import the contents of each layer.
 
4. Highlight one of the layers you’ve chosen to import.
 
 You can choose from several options that appear on the right side of 
the panel. (See the sidebar “The Photoshop Import Options panel,” for a 
detailed explanation of each option.)
 
5. Click OK to import the file.
 
 The artwork you selected appears on your stage.
 
Because you can selectively import layers and merge layers together 
directly from the Import panel, consider using .psd files instead of import-
ing flattened artwork (such as JPEGs or GIFs). This new panel allows you to 
extract specific elements and maintain transparency from Photoshop layers.
Importing Illustrator (.ai) files
Because Illustrator and Flash both natively create vector artwork, you can 
import graphics created in Illustrator into Flash for placement or editing 
with tools, such as the Pen tool and Subselection tool.

Importing .ai files is nearly identical to importing .psd files, with a full 
layer view and lots of options for converting and distributing artwork and 
type from Illustrator layers. In addition to the new import options, the qual-
ity of imported Illustrator artwork is superior to past versions of Flash.
Before you begin, select an Illustrator file that you want to use. The flexibil-
ity of the Illustrator Import panel can best be explored with files that make 
use of type and graphics.
To import an Illustrator file, follow these steps:
 
1. In a new Flash document, choose File➪Import➪Import to Stage; 
choose an Illustrator file from your hard drive and choose Open 
(Windows) or Import (Mac).
 
 The Import to Stage dialog box appears with a full view of all layers in 
your Illustrator document.
 
2. With the check boxes, select the layers you want to import into your 
document.
 
3. Highlight each layer you’ve chosen for import to set options for each 
one, as shown in Figure 5-9.
 
 You can import each layer and individual path as either a bitmap or an 
editable path. You can import groups as bitmaps or movie clips.
 
4. Click OK to import the artwork to the Flash stage.
 
 Check out the stage and the Library panel to see how your artwork was 
placed in Flash (see Figure 5-10).

Look for the Incompatibility Report button at the bottom of the layer view 
in your Import panel. This button can indicate potential problems that 
can prevent the artwork from importing properly into Flash. If you see the 
Incompatibility Report button, click it and read the warnings to address any 
pending issues before import.
A view of the Illustrator Import Options panel
The Illustrator Import Options panel gives you 
a detailed choice of what gets imported from 
.ai files. You can convert grouped artwork, 
compound paths, and type layers to movie clips 
or bitmaps or keep them as editable paths or 
type layers.
Layer view: All layers in your .ai appear in 
this panel, and you can choose which layers to 
import by selecting the check boxes to the left. 
Highlighting a layer displays its import options 
on the right.
Incompatibility Report button: When this button 
is active, potential issues exist in your Illustrator 
file that may need to be resolved for a clean, 
successful import. Click this button and review 
the report to resolve any problems before com-
pleting the import.
Convert Layers to Flash Layers or Convert Layers 
to Keyframes: Selecting the Flash Layers option 
keeps layer structure (as well as layer groups) 
and distributes layer contents exactly as they 
are in your .ai file. Selecting the Keyframes 
option distributes layer contents across a 
sequence of keyframes on the Timeline.
Place Layers at Original Position: This check 
box (selected by default) positions layer con-
tents exactly as they appear in the original 
Illustrator file.
Set Stage to Same Size as Illustrator Canvas: 
Selecting this option resizes your movie dimen-
sions to match the original size of the .ai file.
Import as
 ✓ Bitmap Image: Selecting this option raster-
izes (converts vector to bitmap) the selected 
artwork and imports it to the stage and 
library as a bitmap. Any vector artwork or 
type loses its editability.
 ✓ Editable Path (Individual Paths Only): 
Selecting this option places vector paths in 
Illustrator as drawing objects that you can 
further modify on the Flash stage.
 ✓ Editable Text (Type Layers Only): Selecting 
this option keeps imported text layers edit-
able, re-creating Illustrator type paths as 
Flash type layers.
Create Movie Clip for This Layer: Selecting this 
option converts the layer contents to a new 
movie clip symbol, which is also added to the 
library. You have the option of setting a regis-
tration point as well as an instance name. (See 
Chapter 6 of this minibook for more on instance 
names.) This option and Convert to Bitmap are 
the only available options for entire Illustrator 
layers and grouped artwork.
Import Unused Symbols: Illustrator CS4 files can 
contain their own symbol libraries, which work 
in a similar manner to Flash symbols. Symbols 
that exist in an imported .ai file but that aren’t 
being used on the canvas are added to the Flash 
library when you select this check box.
Note: You can choose to import an Illustrator 
document’s entire symbol library without import-
ing any visible artwork from its canvas.
Import as a Single Bitmap Image: Selecting 
this option flattens and rasterizes the entire 
Illustrator document and places it as a bitmap 
image on the stage, as well as a bitmap asset in 
your Flash document’s library.

Importing Sounds

Importing Sounds
The best multimedia creations not only use visuals and motion, but also 
sound and music, so your Flash movies should, too! Flash fully supports the 
import, placement, and control of sounds in lots of different formats, so you 
can easily bring in loops, sound effect files, and even music from your .mp3 
collection.
You can enhance your movie with background music or narrative, and 
sound effects can make using buttons and menus more intuitive. Flash can 
stream longer sounds (such as soundtracks or long form narration) to mini-
mize loading time so that your user gets right to the good stuff.
Flash imports the following audio file formats:
 
✦ MP3
 
✦ Windows WAV
 
✦ AIFF
Note: Additional file formats are available with the optional QuickTime plug-in 
installed.
Follow these steps to import a sound into your library:
 
1. Create a new Flash document and choose File➪Import➪Import to 
Library.
 
2. Browse and choose an .mp3, .wav, or .aiff file from your hard drive 
and click Open (Windows) or Choose (Mac).
 
3. Choose Window➪Library to launch the Library panel.
 
 The sound appears in the library with a speaker icon, as shown in 
Figure 5-11.
 
Figure 5-11:

4. Select the sound and check out the Preview window.
 
 A waveform preview of your sound appears, and you can listen to your 
sound with the Stop and Play buttons in the upper-right corner of the 
panel.
 
If you need audio files to work with, many Web sites, such as Flash Kit, 
and FlashSound, provide low-cost or free sound effects and loops in Flash-
friendly formats. Adobe also has a listing of sound effects sites at www.
adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_14274.
Placing sounds on the Timeline
After you have your favorite sounds into your Flash document, you can 
place them on keyframes along the Timeline to have them play at specific 
points in your movie.
You can assign sounds with the Property inspector, which displays the 
Sound section when a keyframe is selected. Sounds can be combined across 
different layers and utilized inside buttons to create sound effects for con-
trols and navigation menus.
To place a sound on the Timeline, follow these steps:
 
1. On a new layer, create a blank keyframe along the Timeline and 
launch the Property inspector (if it’s not already visible).
 
2. On the right side of the Property inspector, locate the Sound section 
and select a sound from the Name drop-down list.
 
 This drop-down list gives all the sounds currently in your library (see 
Figure 5-12).
 
 The sound is now placed on your Timeline.
 
3. Press Enter/Return to play your movie.
 
 The sound plays when the playhead reaches the keyframe.
After you place a sound on your Timeline, you can use additional options 
on the Property inspector to control looping, repeats, and playback perfor-
mance. The most common options to experiment with are the Repeat and 
Loop options, which control the number of times (if any) a sound should 
repeat when it’s played.
To repeat the sound, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the keyframe where you already have a sound placed and 
locate the Sound options on the Property inspector.

want the sound to repeat in the text box to the right.
 
 By default, the sound repeats at least once, but if you enter 2 for exam-
ple, your sound repeats twice.
 
3. Press Enter/Return to play your movie.
 
 The sound you placed plays and then repeats the number of times you 
entered in Step 2.
To loop (repeat endlessly) the sound, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the keyframe and, with the Sound options, click the arrow 
beside Repeat and choose Loop from the drop-down list.
 
 The sound is now set to loop continuously until the movie is shut down 
or another action turns it off.
 
2. Choose File➪Publish Preview➪Flash to preview your movie.
 
 The sound plays and then continues to repeat until you close the preview.

Editing sounds
One of Flash’s hidden treasures is the Edit Envelope dialog box, which per-
forms trims and volume effects and lets you dial in volume and pan settings 
for each sound placed in your movie. Although nothing quite replaces well-
recorded and edited source files, you can do last-minute, nondestructive 
edits so that your sounds complement the rest of your movie.
To edit a sound, select a keyframe that has a sound placed on it or add a 
sound to a new keyframe, and then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the keyframe on which the sound is placed.
 
2. In the Property inspector, locate and click the Edit button in the 
Sound section.
 
 The Edit Envelope dialog box appears with a waveform preview. The 
center time ruler has two sliders on the far left and far right.
 
3. Move these sliders to edit the in and out points of the sound or to trim 
unnecessary silence, as shown in Figure 5-13.
 
 The lines above each waveform represent the volume envelope.
 
Figure 5-13: 
Eliminate 
silence by 
sliding the 
starting trim 
point right 
and the

4. Click the lines above each waveform and drag them up or down to 
adjust the overall volume of the sound or to add handles and vary the 
volume at different points during the sound.
 
 The higher the line or handle, the louder the sound.
 
5. Use the Effect drop-down list in the top-left corner to choose from sev-
eral preset volume and pan effects to enhance your sound.
 
6. When you’re done, click OK and then press Return/Enter to play your 
movie and hear the changes made to your sound.

Playing it right with Sync options
In the Sound section of the Property inspector, 
you see the Sync Options drop-down list, which 
controls how individual sounds load and play in 
your movie. Because a sound can serve differ-
ent purposes (background music, narrative, and 
sound effect), the sync options can tell sounds 
to stream, stop, start, or fully load before play-
back so that they keep in step with animation 
and events in your movie.
Here are four options in the Sync Options drop-
down list, each of which is tailored for a spe-
cific sound situation:
 ✓ Event: Choose Event when sounds need 
to fully load in your movie before they can 
play. This option is a good choice for short 
sounds and effects used on the Timeline, 
buttons, or navigation elements. Like their 
namesake, these sounds are best suited 
for responding to non-synchronized events, 
such as a button being clicked or the play-
head hitting a specific frame.
 ✓ Start: Choose Start to set a sound in motion, 
but also keep more than one instance of that 
sound from playing at a time, preventing 
overlap. You can use this option for sounds 
that can potentially be triggered multiple 
times (such as an introductory narrative on 
the first frame). A sound with the Start option 
plays until the end and can be interrupted 
only by a sound with the Stop option.
 ✓ Stop: Choose Stop when you don’t actually 
play a chosen sound, but want to stop that 
sound if it’s already playing. A sound with 
the Stop option can be used to terminate a 
sound with the Start or Event options of the 
same name.
 ✓ Stream: Choose Stream for long form sounds, 
such as a soundtrack or a narrative that 
needs to remain in sync with animation on 
the Timeline. When a sound is set to Stream, 
it starts immediately, even as the remainder 
of the sound continues to load in the back-
ground. Flash ensures that the sound keeps 
playing in sync with the Timeline, even if it 
has to drop frames from the animation.

C
omplicated machines, such as an automobile, are made from many 
smaller machines and moving parts. To build an automobile any other 
way is just not possible. Along those lines, you may find that some anima-
tions are too elaborate to create on the main Timeline alone. You’ll want to 
break them down into smaller animations that can be brought together as 
part of a larger animation.
You’ll also find that your movie may need to reuse several, identical anima-
tions. (Think about the four spinning wheels on a car.) For these cases, you 
have movie clips.
What Are Movie Clips?
The movie clip is a powerful and versatile symbol type that can include 
entire, independent animations, yet be placed and maintained in your movie 
just as easily as graphic symbols. It’s one of three symbol types in Flash, 
and just like graphic symbols (see Chapter 3 of this minibook), they can be 
easily duplicated and maintained from a single master symbol in the library.
Movie clips are unique in that each one contains its very own timeline that 
looks and works just like the main Timeline. This timeline is completely 
self-contained, so animations in movie clips don’t depend on or rely on the 
length of an animation contained within the main Timeline. Movie clips 
can almost be thought of as movies within your movie. Movie clips behave 

Creating and Placing Movie Clips

just like other symbols, so several instances of the same movie clip can 
be dragged to the main stage to easily duplicate animations. If you need to 
change an animation that appears several times throughout your movie, you 
need to modify only the original movie clip in the library that contains it.
Movie clips have all the same features as graphic symbols: You can easily 
drag multiple instances to the stage, and each instance can have its own 
scaling, tint, alpha, and rotation applied.
Because movie clips are capable of containing independent animations, 
they’re a great way to break down complex animations into smaller, more 
manageable pieces. Trying to coordinate too many animations across the 
main Timeline may not only be very difficult, but in some cases, impossible, 
depending on what you’re trying to create.
Movie clips can also be nested inside other movie clips, giving you virtually 
unlimited levels of depth and complexity!
 
Frame rate is a global setting for your movie and sets the rate for all movie 
clips as well as the main Timeline. To speed up or slow down individual 
movie clip animations, consider modifying the length of any included tweens 
before adjusting the overall frame rate.
In conjunction with Flash Player 10, movie clips provide 3D support, allow-
ing you to take 2D artwork contained in movie clip symbols and rotate and 
position them in the 3D realm. In addition, all 3D properties can be animated, 
opening the door for stunning camera, rotation, and depth effects.
Flash CS4 adds two new tools: 3D Rotation and 3D Translation tools, which 
let you transform movie clip instances along x, y, and z axes. You can animate 
3D properties as part of a standard motion tween and modify them with the 
Motion Editor panel. You explore these in detail later in this chapter.
Creating and Placing Movie Clips
Movie clips are created as new, empty symbols as well as from existing con-
tent on the stage. If you create a movie clip from scratch, you can add anima-
tion and graphics later by editing the symbol.
Follow these steps to create a movie clip from existing graphics:
 
1. Create some interesting graphics on the stage with the drawing tools.
 
2. Select the new artwork and choose Modify➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears (see Figure 6-1).

3. Enter a name for your new movie clip in the Name text box, choose 
Movie Clip from the Type drop-down list, select a Folder (if other than 
the main Library root), and click OK.
 
 The artwork now appears as a movie clip on the stage.
 
 4. Choose Window➪Library to check out your new symbol in the library 
with a special Movie Clip icon next to it.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Add artwork

library as a

symbol.
 
Nonanimated graphics converted to movie clips behave the same as graphic 
symbols, so you can place, tween, and modify instances on the stage. The 
difference, however, is that you can always add animated content later to 
the movie clip by editing it and creating tweens on its own Timeline.
In most cases, you’ll want to take full advantage of movie clips by adding 
animation in a new movie clip symbol. To do so, you can start with a new 
empty movie clip symbol and add the animated content afterward.
To create a new movie clip symbol and add animation, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Insert➪New Symbol.
 
 The Create New Symbol dialog box appears.
 
2. Enter a name for your movie clip in the Name text box, select Movie 
Clip from the Type drop-down list, choose a Folder (if other than the 
Library root) to sort the new symbol into, and click OK to create the 
new symbol.
 
 You see a new Timeline, as shown in Figure 6-2, and you will be inside 
the symbol ready to add animation. This Timeline works just like the 
main Timeline: You can add and reorder layers and create tweens. You 
still need to convert any artwork to graphic symbols before creating 
motion tweens.
 
3. Create a new graphic on frame 1 of the existing layer 1, select the 
graphic, choose Modify➪Convert to Symbol, and choose Graphic from 
the Type drop-down list.

4. Right-click frame 1 and choose Create Motion Tween to create a new 
tween span on the layer; click and drag the last frame of the tween 
span to shorten it to 24 frames (only if the span is greater than 24 
frames).
 
5. On frame 24, change the position or rotation of your symbol to set it 
in motion.
 
6. Press Enter/Return to preview the new Movieclip Timeline and make 
sure your animation plays back properly.
 
7. Click the Scene 1 link above the stage to return back to the main 
Timeline.
 
8. Locate your new movie clip symbol in the Library panel and drag two 
instances of it to the stage, as shown in Figure 6-3.
If you hit the Enter/Return key to watch your movie clip play on the stage, 
you’ll probably be a little disappointed. Don’t worry; to see your movie clip 
in action, you just need to preview your movie in the Flash Player.

Previewing Movie Clip Animation
Movie clips contain their own Timelines, and pressing Enter/Return doesn’t 
start the movie clip’s Timeline, but rather the main Timeline instead. To 
view movie clip animation, preview your movie in the Flash Player using one 
of two methods:
 
✦ Test Movie mode exports a compressed (.swf) Flash movie and imme-
diately launches it in the Flash Player. Test Movie is used to give you a 
quick look at how the finished movie will appear to your end user as you 
build. Test the new movie clip by choosing Control➪Test Movie.
 
 You can preview your movie in Test Movie mode by using the shortcut 
key combination Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Ô+Return (Mac).
 
✦ Publish Preview works similar to Test Movie but exports the .swf 
(compressed Flash movie) using the final delivery settings you’ve 
already created under File➪Publish Settings. Publish Preview can 
also display your movie in an HTML (Web) page in your system’s 
default browser. To preview your movie in Publish Preview, choose 
File➪Publish Preview➪HTML or File➪Publish Preview➪Flash.

Modifying Movie Clip Instances
744
Chapter 9 of this minibook covers publish settings for your movie, but it’s 
important to know how these seemingly identical methods differ. Both meth-
ods let you accurately preview movie clip animation while you create it in 
your movie.
Modifying Movie Clip Instances
You can modify each movie clip instance with its own size, transformation, 
and color settings. This type of flexibility lets you get lots of mileage from a 
single movie clip symbol before having to create a new version or variation 
of your symbol in the Library panel. Just like graphic symbols, these trans-
formations don’t affect the master symbol or other instances on the stage.
 
Although all instances of a movie clip share a Timeline with its master 
symbol in the library, each individual instance can be stopped, started, and 
controlled individually with ActionScript. For more on how to control movie 
clip instances with ActionScript, see Chapter 7 of this minibook.
To transform any instance of a movie clip, you can use the Transform tool, 
the Transform panel, or the Transform submenu located at Modify➪
Transform. Try dragging two more instances of your new movie clip on the 
stage and applying different transformations to each.
To apply a transformation to a movie clip instance, choose the Transform 
tool from the Tools panel and select an instance on the stage. Use the 
handles to resize, distort, and skew the instance or select an instance on the 
stage with the Selection tool and use the Transform panel (open it by choos-
ing Window➪Transform) to type exact amounts for horizontal and vertical 
scale, rotation, and skew.
Use the Style drop-down list in the Color Effect section of the Property 
inspector with any selected movie clip instance to apply unique tints and 
alpha (transparency) effects and change brightness. To apply a color effect 
to a movie clip instance, select an instance on the stage and choose an effect 
from the Style drop-down list. Use the option controls to dial in the exact 
amount and type of color effect you need.
Combining Movie Clips
To create a new animation from several smaller ones, you can create a new 
movie clip from other movie clip instances on the stage. This technique 
allows you to group together several movie clips and drag them as one 

Combining Movie Clips
745
Book VII
Chapter 6
Lights, Camera, 
Movie Clips!
instance to the stage. Unlike a group, however, you gain all the advantages of 
working with symbols, including the ability to duplicate, maintain, and tween 
the combined movie clips as one unit.
The practice of including one movie clip inside another is sometimes 
referred to as nesting. Although movie clips can include other movie clips, 
graphic symbols, and buttons, graphic symbols shouldn’t include movie clip 
instances. Movie clips should always be included in other movie clips so 
that their animation plays back properly.
Follow these steps to create a new movie clip from other movie clips on the 
stage:
 
1. Select two or more movie clip instances on the stage.
 
 These can be instances of different movie clips symbols in your library 
or of the same symbol.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
Figure 6-4: 
You can 
combine 
multiple 
movie clips 
into a single 
movie clip.
 
 
3. Enter a name for your new symbol in the Name text box, choose the 
movie clip from the Type drop-down list, set the Registration Point by 
clicking a point on the grid shown to the right. Click OK to create the 
new symbol.
 
 The Registration Point sets the location from which a symbol’s position 
is determined on the stage. This can be any of the four corners, four 
sides, or the center of the symbol.

Rendering and Animating Movie Clips in the 3D Realm
746
 
 The symbol instances appear on the stage as a single movie clip, and a 
new movie clip appears in your library.
 
4. Convert the selected instances to a new movie clip symbol as you 
would with a single graphic.
You can now drag and drop several instances of the new movie clip to the 
stage. Experiment by adding a few instances to the stage and applying differ-
ent transformations or color effects to each. Preview your movie by choos-
ing Control➪Test Movie, and you see that the movie clips now are treated as 
one item, but still animate and behave as they did when they were separate 
instances on the stage.
When you nest movie clips inside each other, you’re creating dependencies 
between those symbols in your library. Movie clips that include other movie 
clip symbols do so by reference; the included movie clip symbols aren’t 
duplicated but are connected to the movie clip that includes them.
Movie clips become dependent on any other symbols they’re created from. 
The smaller symbols remain in the library and are referenced by the movie 
clip that includes them. This means that you can’t remove included movie 
clips without destroying the symbols that they’re part of. For this reason, 
make sure that you don’t trash any symbols in your Library panel until 
you’re sure that they’re not being used in your movie or by another movie 
clip symbol.
A great way to check what symbols are in use is to choose Select Unused 
Items from the Library panel’s panel menu. This highlights symbols in your 
Library panel that aren’t being used anywhere on the stage or by other sym-
bols in the library. If a movie clip isn’t used on the stage but is included in 
another symbol, it isn’t highlighted, indicating that it’s “in use.”
Rendering and Animating Movie Clips 
in the 3D Realm
A welcome new addition to Flash’s extensive capabilities is 3D rendering via 
the 3D Translation and 3D Rotation tools. You can use each of these tools to 
rotate and position 2D content in any movie clip instance around or along x, 
y, and z axes.
Combined with Flash’s powerful animation engine, you can animate these 
properties as part of a motion tween to add cool depth, camera panning, and 
rotation effects to your movies.

The 3D Rotation tool
 
 This new tool can be used on any movie clip instance to rotate and trans-
form the symbol around x, y, and z axes.
To render a movie clip instance in 3D, follow these steps:
 
1. Place a movie clip instance on a new layer on the Timeline by drag-
ging it from the Library panel.
 
2. Select the 3D Rotation tool from the Tools panel and click the new 
movie clip instance to select it.
 
 Color-coded circular handles appear, each one corresponding to an axis 
along which the movie clip can be rotated.
 
3. Rotate your movie clip as follows (see Figure 6-5):
 
• Click and drag the green line that crosses horizontally through your 
movie clip directly on the line to spin your movie clip around the y 
(vertical) axis.
 
• Click and drag the red line that crosses vertically through your 
movie clip to rotate your movie clip around the x (horizontal) axis.
 
• Click and drag on the blue circle that surrounds your movie clip to 
rotate it around the z axis (depth).
 
• Click and drag the outermost red circle in any direction to rotate 
multiple axes at once.
 
To reset all transformations performed with the 3D Rotation tool, select the 
movie clip and hold down Ctrl+Shift+Z (Windows) or Ô+Shift+Z (Mac).
Using the 3D Translation tool
 
 In contrast to the 3D Rotation tool, which rotates movie clips around an axis, 
the 3D Translation tool slides a movie clip along a specific axis to change its 
perceived distance and depth relative to other objects on the stage.
Think of it as having three train tracks going left to right, up and down, or 
forward and backward that your movie clip can ride along.
To use the 3D Translation tool to move your movie clip in three dimensions, 
follow these steps:
 
1. With the Selection tool, place a movie clip from by dragging it from 
the Library panel, or click to select an existing movie clip instance on 
the stage.

at once.
 
 
2. Choose the 3D Translation tool from the Tools panel, which you can 
find under the 3D Rotation tool.
 
 Three guides appear corresponding to the x, y, and z axes. You can slide 
your movie clip along any of these three guides by clicking and dragging 
the appropriate guide, as shown in Figure 6-6:
 
• To slide your move clip left to right along the x axis, click and drag the 
arrow connected to the red horizontal guide line.
 
• To slide your movie clip up or down along the y axis, click and drag 
the arrow connected to the green vertical guide line.
 
• To change the perceived distance of your movie clip on the stage, click 
and drag the blue center point to slide it along the z axis.
 
3D Translation and 3D Rotation transformations can be combined on the 
same movie clip for interesting perspective effects.

Tweening 3D properties
After you have a feel for how the 3D Rotation and 3D Translation tools trans-
form your movie clips, you can incorporate these effects into a motion tween 
just as easily as you would with position and transparency.
Follow these steps to create a tween with 3D properties:
 
1. Place a single movie clip instance on a new layer on the Timeline by 
dragging it from the Library panel.
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the first frame of the new 
layer and choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu that 
appears.
 
 A new tween span is created, and the playhead jumps to the end of the 
span.
 
3. Select the 3D Rotation tool and click the movie clip to make it active; 
circular handles appear around the instance.

4. Click and drag the axes to rotate your movie clip until you’ve set an 
angle and position you want.
 
5. Press the Enter/Return key to play back your Timeline, and your 
movie clip tweens from its original 2D position to the 3D settings you 
applied, as shown in Figure 6-7.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3–5 with the 3D Translation tool to see your movie clip 
slide in three dimensions.

Chapter 7: Controlling Your 
Movie with ActionScript
In This Chapter
✓ Introducing ActionScript
✓ Adding actions to the Timeline
✓ Creating button controls
✓ Working with buttons in ActionScript
W
hether you’re creating a Web site, presentation, or game, a truly 
interactive experience is one in which your users can control the 
action. If you want to take your movies to the next level, ActionScript can 
help. Flash’s built-in scripting language has come a long way and can do 
anything from controlling movie playback to creating complex games.
This chapter introduces you to ActionScript and shows you how to use it to 
create interactive elements, such as clickable buttons, in your movies.
Getting to Know ActionScript
ActionScript is a powerful scripting language that you can incorporate into 
your movies to control playback, navigation, and imported media, such as 
images, video, and audio. ActionScript is written as a series of commands 
(or actions) that are placed on the Timeline, buttons, movie clip, and exter-
nal files using the Actions panel. Think of ActionScript as a set of instruc-
tions that you can give your movie to tell it how to behave and add abilities.
ActionScript is often used for timeline control so that your animations can 
be told when and where to stop, loop, play, or jump to other points along a 
Timeline. You can also make truly interactive movies by adding ActionScript 
to buttons on the stage so that your users can control the animation, too!
The Actions panel
All ActionScript throughout your movie is placed using the Actions panel 
(see Figure 7-1), which acts as a wizard, reference book, and script editor 
all in one. You can add actions from the Actions toolbox using a categorized 

Getting to Know ActionScript
752
tray or drop-down list, or you can type them directly into the script editor. A 
handy Script Assist mode (see the next section) is available so that you can 
add and modify actions without typing the code by hand (we highly recom-
mend the Script Assist mode for new users).
 
Figure 7-1: 
The Actions 
panel.
 
To launch the Actions panel, choose Window➪Actions or use the F9 
(Windows) or Option+F9 (Mac) shortcut key combination.
To place an action on a frame, select the frame on the Timeline and launch 
the Actions panel. To place an action on a button or movie clip (ActionScript 
2.0 only), select the button or movie clip instance on the stage and launch 
the Actions panel.
Script Assist mode
For users who are new to ActionScript, the Script Assist mode is a wizard that 
lets you use a series of menus, buttons, and text boxes to build your scripts 
without getting into the nuts and bolts of the code itself. Script Assist mode 
helps prevent time-consuming errors so that you spend more time being cre-
ative and less time troubleshooting.
Throughout this chapter, you use Script Assist mode while you become 
more familiar with ActionScript and how it works.
To enable Script Assist mode, click the Script Assist button in the upper-
right corner of the Actions panel.

Book VII
Chapter 7
Controlling 
Your Movie with 
ActionScript
Getting to Know ActionScript
753
ActionScript is understood and processed by the Flash Player, so some 
scripted movies need tested by choosing Control➪Test Movie. However, you 
can also enable simple actions in the authoring environment so that you can 
see your work in progress while still working from the Timeline.
ActionScript 3.0 versus ActionScript 2.0
ActionScript Version 3.0 brings many new major changes and improvements 
to the way ActionScript performs, as well as how it’s created within your 
movies. ActionScript 3.0 requires the placement of actions on the Timeline 
or within external files (you can no longer place actions directly on movie 
clips or buttons) to make the code as modular as possible.
 
For first-time coders or users who aren’t familiar with the principles of 
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages, these concepts may present 
a significant learning curve.
ActionScript 2.0 doesn’t take advantage of the new methods, abilities, and 
speed improvements of ActionScript 3.0, but it does allow for more flexibility 
by allowing scripts to be added directly on buttons and movie clips. In addi-
tion to a smaller learning curve, ActionScript 2.0 is still utilized in movies 
created in earlier versions of Flash.
Note: ActionScript 3.0 support is available only in Flash Player versions 9 
and 10. However, these later versions continue to support ActionScript 2.0 
as well.
This chapter illustrates both versions wherever possible to give you the abil-
ity to work with movies published for either version. This is especially true 
of legacy (or older) files that you may need to update.
Specifying the correct publish settings
Depending on whether you choose to use ActionScript 2.0 or 3.0, you’ll need 
to adjust the ActionScript version in your publish settings to match the 
version you choose to work in. In most cases, you can’t publish newer 3.0 
scripts in a version 2.0 movie, and vice versa. To choose the appropriate 
ActionScript version, choose File➪Publish Settings; click the Flash tab and 
choose ActionScript Version 2.0 or ActionScript Version 3.0 from the Script 
drop-down list.
 
You can also open the Publish Settings dialog box from the Property inspec-
tor by making sure no objects or frames are selected and then clicking the 
Edit button in the Publish section.

Adding Scripts to the Timeline
754
Adding Scripts to the Timeline
To add actions to a specific point on the Timeline, create a keyframe that 
you can put your ActionScript in. You can add ActionScript to keyframes 
with existing content, but it’s always a good practice to separate your 
scripts from visual elements on the stage by creating a dedicated layer for 
your ActionScript. This layer prevents accidentally selecting the wrong thing 
when you try to add ActionScript to a keyframe or symbol.
The following sections use basic ActionScript to control a new tween on 
your Timeline. Before getting started, you need to create a new graphic 
symbol from artwork or typography on your stage.
Using stop()
The stop() action does exactly what it sounds like: stops the Timeline at 
whatever frames the action’s placed on. A common use of stop() is to keep 
a movie from looping, which is the default behavior for the Flash Player.
Follow these steps to create a stop action in your movie:
 
1. On a new layer, create a motion or shape tween from frames 1–24 and 
press Enter/Return to play back and preview the animation.
 
 For more information on creating tweens, see Chapter 3 of this minibook.
 
2. Click the New Layer button below the Timeline to create a new layer 
and name it Actions. If necessary, drag the layer upwards so it’s the 
topmost layer in the stack.
 
 This dedicated layer is where you add ActionScript to control your new 
motion tween.
 
3. Add a keyframe on frame 24 of the new Actions layer with the F6 
shortcut key.
 
4. Select the keyframe and choose Window➪Actions to launch the 
Actions panel.
 
5. In the Actions panel, locate the Script Assist button and click it.
 
 The top panel expands, and you’re now working in Script Assist mode.
 
6. Add a stop method, which stops the Timeline of a movie clip (includ-
ing the main Timeline).
 
 Here’s how:

Adding Scripts to the Timeline
755
 
• In ActionScript 3.0: Click the plus sign at the top of the Actions panel 
and choose flash.display➪MovieClip➪Methods➪Stop. Specify the 
name of the object you want to control in the Object text box up 
top. Because you’re stopping the current (main) Timeline, refer to it 
by entering this in the Object text box, as shown in Figure 7-2. The 
actions panel reads
   import flash.display.MovieClip;
   this.stop();
 
• In ActionScript 2.0: Click the plus sign at the top of the Actions panel 
and choose Global Functions➪Timeline Control➪Stop. The Actions 
panel should read stop();.
 
 Take a look at your Timeline and you’ll notice that a lowercase a now 
appears inside the keyframe, which indicates that ActionScript on the 
keyframe. These scripts run when the playhead passes that keyframe.
 
7. Choose Control➪Test Movie to preview your movie.
 
 The animation plays until frame 24 and then stops.

Using goto: gotoAndPlay() and gotoAndStop()
To loop a movie or to send the playhead to a different point on the 
Timeline, you can tell your movie to jump forward or backward to a spe-
cific frame with one of two variations of the goto action: gotoAndPlay() 
and gotoAndStop(). Each of these two actions requires a frame name or 
number so that the action knows where to send the playhead. When placed 
on a frame, these actions send the playhead forward or backward to the 
specified frame and stop, or they resume playback from that point.
To use gotoAndStop, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Actions layer, select and create a new keyframe at frame 23.
 
2. Choose Window➪Actions to open the Actions panel.
 
3. Apply a gotoAndStop action on this frame to send the playhead to a 
specific frame and have it stop.
 
 Here’s how:
 
• In ActionScript 3.0: Click the plus sign and choose flash.display➪
MovieClip➪Methods➪gotoAndStop. In the Object field, have the 
Timeline refer to itself by entering this in the Object text box. Enter 
1 in the Frame text box and make sure the Scene text box is empty. 
The actions should now read
   import flash.display.MovieClip;
   this.gotoAndStop(1);
 
• In ActionScript 2.0: Click the plus sign and choose Global Functions➪
Timeline Control➪goto. The action defaults to gotoAndPlay() — 
select the gotoAndStop() radio button instead. Leave 1 in the 
Frame text box. The action should now read
   gotoAndStop(1);
 
4. Choose Control➪Test Movie to preview your movie.
 
 The tween plays and jumps to the first frame, where it stops.
Follow these steps to use gotoAndPlay():
 
1. Select and create a new keyframe at frame 22 on your Actions layer 
and launch your Actions panel.
 
2. Apply a gotoAndPlay action at frame 22 to create a loop between this 
frame and frame 5 of your movie.

 The animation plays until frame 22 and loops between frames 5 and 22.
Creating Button Symbols
In everyday life, buttons give you control over your world, whether it’s 
switching on a light or your TV at home or navigating through Web pages 
and e-mail messages online. To make your movies better, you can use but-
tons to give your users control over the action with Timeline control and 
navigation.

Creating Button Symbols
758
In Flash, buttons are special symbol types built to respond to mouse or key-
board interaction, such as clicks, rollovers, and specific key presses. When 
paired with ActionScript, buttons can be used for just about any navigation 
or control task. Buttons are created in the same way as other symbol types, 
and you can easily drag instances to the stage from your library to create 
more buttons.
Creating a new button
Like graphic symbols, you can create buttons from existing content on the 
stage or as new empty symbols to which you can add content later.
Follow these steps to create a new button symbol from existing content:
 
1. On a new layer in your document, create a new, solid shape on the 
stage that you want to use as a button and select the shape with the 
Selection tool.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a name for your new button in the Name text box and choose 
Button from the Type drop-down list.
 
4. Click OK to create the button.
Choose Window➪Library to launch the Library panel, and you see the new 
symbol with the special button icon next to it.
Button states
Take a look inside your button by double-clicking it on the stage or in the 
Library panel; its unique Timeline contains four specially marked frames: Up, 
Over, Down, and Hit. Each frame represents a button state, or the appearance 
of a button, as it interacts with a mouse in different ways.
Each frame, or state, can contain unique artwork so that your button can 
change appearance as it’s clicked, pressed, or released. You can even add 
layers inside your button to stack artwork for more creative flexibility. Here 
are the states and what they represent:
 
✦ Up: The appearance of your button when it’s not pressed or rolled over. 
This is the state you see most of the time as the button sits on the stage.
 
✦ Over: The appearance of the button when the mouse pointer rolls over 
it. Adding unique content to this frame creates the rollover effect many 
people know and love from Web buttons.
 
✦ Down: The appearance of the button when it’s clicked and the mouse 
button is held down.

✦ Hit: The contents of this frame aren’t actually visible but set the hot 
spot, or clickable area, of your button. If the Hit frame is empty, it uses 
the shape on the last available state by default. You can create a more 
specific clickable area if you want to give the user more or less area to 
work with or simplify usability for odd-shaped buttons.
 
 Use a filled shape in the Hit frame so that the end user has no problem 
interacting with your button.
Adding content to button states
You can add content to each frame of your button to make it complete as 
follows:
 
1. If it’s not already open, edit your new button by double-clicking it on 
the stage or in the Library panel.
 
 You should have some content on the Up state from when you created 
the button. Now you can define content for remaining states as well.
 
2. Select the Over frame on the button’s Timeline and add a new key-
frame with the F6 shortcut key.
 
3. Use the Selection tool, Property inspector, or additional drawing tools 
to modify the artwork on the Over frame (see Figure 7-4).

4. Select the Down frame and insert a new keyframe with the F6 short-
cut key.
 
5. Modify or add content to the Down frame.
 
 This determines how the button appears when the user clicks and holds 
down the mouse button.
 
6. Select the Hit frame and create a new keyframe by pressing the F6 
shortcut key.
 
7. Use the existing artwork that is copied to this keyframe, or one of the 
shape tools to fill this frame with a large, filled Hit area.
 
8. Exit the button by clicking Scene 1 above the stage.
 
9. Choose Control➪Test Movie to preview your movie.
 
 Rollover and click your new button to see the different states in action.
Enable simple buttons
Although choosing Control➪Test Movie to preview your work is always a 
good idea, you may want to see how certain elements of your movie behave 
in real time on the stage. To see buttons in action on the stage as you build 
your movie, you can choose Control➪Enable Simple Buttons. You then see 
buttons as they’d appear and respond to your user in the Flash Player.
 
Keep in mind that buttons can’t be selected or modified on the stage in this 
mode; you need to disable Enable Simple Buttons to apply actions or trans-
formations, or to edit the button in place.
Modifying button instances
Individual button instances can each have unique transformations and 
color effects applied, just like graphic symbol instances. In addition, each 
button can have a unique ActionScript applied to it, so you can use several 
instances of a single button symbol to create an entire menu or control bar.
Here’s how you add and modify additional instances of your button on the 
stage:
 
1. Choose Window➪Library to make sure that your Library panel is 
visible.
 
2. Drag two more instances of your button symbol onto the same layer as 
your existing button instance.
 
 If necessary, position the buttons so that they’re spread apart from each 
other.
 
3. Select one of the button instances and choose Window➪Properties.
 
 The Property inspector opens.

4. Choose Tint from the Style drop-down list in the Color Effect section.
 
5. Select a color and set the tint percentage to 100 percent.
 
 The button becomes tinted with the chosen color.
 
6. Select a different button instance, choose the Transform tool from 
the Tools panel, and use the Transform tool to resize or rotate the 
selected button.
Preview your buttons by choosing Control➪Test Movie or by choosing 
Control➪Enable Simple Buttons.
Using Buttons with ActionScript
The real power of buttons is realized when you combine them with 
ActionScript. In ActionScript 2.0, you can apply actions directly to button 
instances; in ActionScript 3.0, you define button actions and the events that 
trigger them on the Timeline or in external ActionScript files.
The tasks described in the following sections take place in ActionScript 
3.0. Before you get started, make sure your publish settings are set to 
ActionScript Version 3.0. Choose File➪Publish Settings; in the dialog box 
that appears, click the Flash tab and then choose ActionScript 3.0 from the 
Script drop-down list.
Understanding event handlers
In the following sections, you get a chance to define actions for your button, 
as well as the event handlers that trigger them. An event handler tells your 
button what actions to perform if and when a certain event occurs, such as 
clicks, rollovers, and key presses.
Unlike frame-based actions, which always occur at the same time and only 
respond to the playhead, you can use buttons at any time (or not at all) and 
respond to several different types of user interaction. For this reason, as you 
place actions on buttons in Script Assist mode, event handlers are added 
automatically.
Creating a stop button
To get rolling (or clicking), you can use the button instances you’ve already 
placed as controls for the tween on your Timeline. You can add unique 
scripts to each of these buttons to tell the Timeline to stop, play, or jump to 
specific points on it.
 
An important step you need to take before trying to connect actions to a 
button is assigning that button an instance name. Instance names are how 
ActionScript can identify a specific object on the stage.

Using Buttons with ActionScript
762
Before you get started, make sure that you remove and re-create the Actions 
layer if you’ve created one (described in the earlier section, “Using stop( )”); 
the actions on this layer will conflict with your button actions.
To create a stop button, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new Flash document.
 
 Add some basic animation to the Timeline by creating a symbol, placing 
it on a new layer, and creating a Motion tween.
 
2. Create a new button and drag it from the library to a new layer on the 
Timeline.
 
3. Select the button instance on the stage and in the Property inspector, 
enter a name (such as stop_btn) for the button instance in the text box 
to the right of the button icon (see Figure 7-5).
 
 Before you can control this button with ActionScript, assign it an 
instance name. You use this name from this point in your ActionScript 
to refer to and to control this specific button instance.
 
4. Create a new layer on the Timeline, and name it Actions.
 
Figure 7-5: 
Assign 
a button 
instance a 
name with 
the Property 
inspector; 
ActionScript 
can’t control 
the button 
without it.

5. Select the first keyframe of the new Actions layer and choose 
Window➪Actions to open the Actions panel if it’s not already open.
 
 In the upper-right corner, make sure the Script Assist button is turned off.
 
6. Click in the Script window and enter the following:
function stopAnim(evt:Event):void {
stop();
}
 
 This code represents the event handler — the instructions that respond 
when the stop button is clicked. Just as described earlier in this chap-
ter, you’re using the same basic stop() action, but this time, it runs 
in response to the button click and not at any specific point when the 
movie plays back.
 
 Here, the event handler is given the arbitrary stopAnim name, but 
it could be named just about anything. The function statement lets 
ActionScript know that all the code that follows is grouped under 
stopAnim.
 
 A function is a group of related ActionScript statements. Just like how 
you can physically group together graphics on the stage, a function 
statement virtually groups together multiple lines of ActionScript code 
that need to run together for a common purpose.
 
7. Assign this new block of code to a specific button instance on the 
stage — in this case, the button you assigned an instance name to in 
Step 1.
 
 Press Enter/Return a few times to move down a few lines under the code 
you just typed and enter the following line of code:
stop_btn.addEventListener(“click”,stopAnim);
 
 This code assigns an event listener, which tells the button to wait for a 
click, and when clicked, to respond using the new stopAnim event han-
dler you created. You’ll notice that ActionScript can now refer to your 
button by its new instance name, stop_btn, and assign code directly to 
it this way.
 
8. Save your file.
 
9. Choose Control➪Test Movie and click your stop button to test it.
 
 Any animation in your movie comes to a halt.
 
If you receive compiler errors in the Compiler Errors window, make sure to 
check spelling, casing, and look for the presence of any odd characters in 
your code. ActionScript is extremely sensitive to case and spelling, so this 
is the first place you look when troubleshooting. Compare your code to the 
code shown in the preceding steps. Also, make sure that the instance name 
you gave your button matches exactly with the name you’re referring to in 
ActionScript.

Using Buttons with ActionScript
764
Using goto
Unlike the stop or play actions, which park or resume playback at the cur-
rent frame, you can use goto to jump forward or backward on the Timeline. 
You can use one of two variations: gotoAndPlay() or gotoAndStop() to 
resume or stop playback from the selected frame, respectively.
To use goto in your movie, follow these steps:
 
1. Place a new button instance on the stage and select it.
 
 Make sure it’s selected by verifying that its options are displayed in the 
Property inspector.
 
2. At the top of the Property inspector, assign the new button an 
instance name by typing in the text box to the right of the button icon.
 
 For example, we entered rewind_btn for the instance name.
 
3. Select the first keyframe of the Actions layer you created in the steps 
in the previous section; choose Window➪Actions to open the Actions 
panel.
 
4. Press the Enter/Return key to make a few lines of room underneath 
any code already in the Script window.
 
5. Type the following on a new line in the Script window:
function rewindAnim(evt:Event):void {
gotoAndStop(1);
} 
 
 This new event handler, rewindAnim, instructs the Timeline to return 
to the first frame and stop.
 
6. Below the new event handler code, make a new line and enter the 
following:
rewind_btn.addEventListener(“click”,rewindAnim);
 
 An event listener has been assigned to the button instance you named 
rewind_btn, instructing it to run the code in rewindAnim when it’s 
clicked.
 
7. Choose Control➪Test Movie.
 
 Clicking the rewind button on the stage now forces the playhead to 
frame 1 and playback stops.
Using frame labels
Many actions often reference exact frame numbers to move backward and 
forward on the Timeline. If you happen to change the placement of some-
thing on your Timeline, however (such as the start or end of an animation),

Book VII
Chapter 7
Controlling 
Your Movie with 
ActionScript
Using Buttons with ActionScript
765
frame numbers may become inaccurate. For cases like these, assign names 
directly to keyframes on the Timeline that you can call directly from 
ActionScript.
Frame labels are familiar names that you can assign to any keyframe (such 
as start, end, or big_finale). You can then tell ActionScript to jump to 
these frames by name as an alternative to using a frame number. If the loca-
tion of the named frame changes, scripts still function as long as the label 
name is the same. When you move a keyframe, the label you assign to it 
moves with it.
Here’s how you can modify a button to use a frame label instead of a frame 
number:
 
1. On an animation layer, select frame 1 of your current Timeline.
 
2. Enter a name for your frame label in the Name text box in the Label 
area of the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
 For example, we assigned this keyframe the label name of top.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Assign any 
keyframe a 
label name 
with the 
Property 
inspector.
 

Using Buttons with ActionScript
766
 
3. Select frame 1 of your Actions layer and choose Window➪Actions to 
open the Actions panel (if it’s not already open).
 
 If you haven’t already, follow the steps in the previous section, “Using 
goto,” to create the rewindAnim function (or event handler).
 
4. Locate the line that reads gotoAndStop(1). Replace 1 with the name 
of your new frame label in double quotes.
 
 The code now reads
function rewindAnim(evt:Event):void {
gotoAndStop(“top”);
} 
 
5. Choose Control➪Test Movie to preview your changes.
 
 Click the rewind button and you’ll see the animation jumps to the begin-
ning just as it did earlier. This time, however, the code uses a frame 
label instead of an absolute frame number.
 
 Now, no matter where you move the keyframe, the script follows auto-
matically as long as the frame label remains the same.
Naming frame labels and instances
Because ns and instance names both end up 
utilized within the ActionScript language, you’re 
limited to certain “programming-friendly” 
naming conventions:
 ✓ Frame labels and instance names can’t con-
tain empty spaces, such as my label. 
You can, however, use underscores if you 
want to string several words together, such 
as my_label.
 ✓ Frame labels and instance names can con-
tain numbers but not in the first character 
position, such as 2ndframe.
 ✓ Avoid punctuation of any type, such as My_
label!!!!
You can use both upper- and lowercase letters 
but make sure that you reference the frame with 
the exact case you named it with; ActionScript 
interprets myButton and mybutton as 
completely different items.

S
ometimes the difference between a good project and a great project 
is having a seamless workflow. Visual aids, such as guides and grids, 
alignment aids, and proper placement of tools and panels are essential parts 
of creating better movies in less time. The Flash workspace is highly cus-
tomizable so that you can work in the most efficient way possible and spend 
more time being creative. Flash CS4 includes a new, easy-to-use interface, as 
well as some great workspace presets for most every type of user.
Using Workspace Layouts
Your Flash workspace consists of all the panels and tools you rely on, so 
why not take some time to customize it? You can save the position and 
appearance of these essential components by creating custom workspace 
layouts.
Workspace layouts take a snapshot of the appearance and position of 
panels you’re using so that you can recall that same configuration at any 
time. You can save as many workspace layouts as you want for different 
projects or different designers who may share the same computer with you.
Choose Window➪Workspace to recall, save, reset, or manage your work-
space layouts.

Using Workspace Layouts
768
 
Flash CS4 comes with several layout presets: Default, Classic, Debug, 
Designer, Developer, and Essentials. You can select and use these layouts 
as a starting point for a new workspace layout or to reset the workspace. 
The default layouts can’t be deleted or overwritten (even by saving a layout 
under the same name).
Creating new layouts
Before creating a new workspace layout, open any panels you need, close 
any panels you don’t use often, and position and size them exactly how you 
think is best. All panels can be toggled on or off with the Window menu. 
Grouping options for each panel are available under their respective panel 
menus, or you can drag and drop panels on top of one another to group 
them together.
To create a new workspace layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Position all panels and toolbars as you want to see them.
 
2. Group any panels together or resize individual panels and groups.
 
 You can also collapse any panels or groups to Icon mode to maximize 
screen area.
 
3. Choose Window➪Workspace➪New Workspace.
 
 A dialog box appears, prompting you to name the new layout.
 
4. Enter a name for the new layout in the Name text box and click OK.
 
 The new workspace is created.
 
5. Choose Window➪Workspace.
 
 You see the new workspace as an available selection.
Managing layouts
After you create workspace layouts, you can rename, delete, or update 
them as needed. Deleting layouts you no longer use is good practice so that 
you can keep the list manageable. Also rename layouts to indicate when 
they were created (for example, MyLayoutFeb2009). You can manage lay-
outs by using the Manage panel (choose Window➪Workspace➪Manage 
Workspaces).
To delete a layout, choose Window➪Workspace➪Manage Workspaces. Select 
the layout you want to delete and click the Delete button. Click OK to exit 
the Manage Workspaces dialog box. Note: You can’t undo this action, but a 
dialog box gives you the same warning and a chance to change your mind.

To rename a layout, choose Window➪Workspace➪Manage Workspaces. 
Select the layout you want to rename and click the Rename button. Enter the 
new name in the Name text box, click OK, and then click OK again to exit the 
dialog box.
To update (or overwrite) an existing layout, recall the layout by choosing 
it in the Workspace menu. Make any adjustments to your workspace and 
choose Window➪Workspace➪New Workspace. When prompted, assign it 
the name of the layout you’re trying to update. A warning alerts you that 
you’re about to replace an existing layout by the same name; click OK to 
overwrite the layout with the new changes.
 
To condense right-side panels to Icon view, collapse the entire panel group 
with the double arrows at the top-right corner of the screen. To hide the 
labels and just view the icons alone, use the ridged handle at the top-left 
corner of the panel group to resize it as narrow as it will go.
Fine-Tuning with Grids and Guides
Having lots of visual aides right at your fingertips is indispensable when you 
need to line up, arrange, or measure objects on your stage with absolute 
accuracy. You’ll want some designs to take advantage of the place-it-anywhere 
flexibility that Flash provides, but other designs demand more precise control 
over placement and sizing. For these cases, you can take advantage of Flash’s 
large array of visual aides and helpers, many of which you can enable and set 
in the View menu.
These visual aides don’t appear in any way in your final movie; they’re 
strictly for your benefit during the design and building process.
Enabling rulers and guides
Flash’s built-in rulers appear on the top and left edges of your stage and are 
used to position and measure objects on the stage. You also use the rulers 
to create vertical and horizontal guides by dragging them off the ruler bars. 
Ruler units are in pixels by default, but you can choose Modify➪Document 
to change to other measurement units, such as inches, centimeters, or 
millimeters.
The top ruler represents the X, or horizontal axis, and the left ruler rep-
resents the Y, or vertical axis. The top-left corner of the stage represents 
absolute 0 for both X and Y, with X increasing as you move right, and Y 
increasing as you move down.

Fine-Tuning with Grids and Guides

To set up and use rulers and guides, follow these steps:
 
1. In a new document, choose View➪Rulers.
 
 The rulers appear on the top and left edges of your stage.
 
2. Click and drag anywhere on the stage.
 
 Markers on both rulers follow to indicate your X and Y positions and the 
width of your selection area. Now you can create guides that you can 
use to position artwork on the stage.
 
3. Click the top ruler bar and drag down.
 
 You’re carrying a guide with you while you drag.
 
4. Watch the ruler on the left and drop the guide where you want it (see 
Figure 8-1).
 
 Use the left ruler for reference so that you know exactly how far down 
you’re placing the new guide — for example, at 200 pixels.

5. Click the ruler on the left and drag toward the right to place another 
guide.
 
 Position this one using the top ruler for reference — for example, place 
it at 250 pixels.
 
6. Grab your Type tool and create a single line of type on the stage, as 
shown in Figure 8-2.
 
 Use a large enough font so that you can easily see and drag the new text.
 
7. Choose your Selection tool; grab the text with the Selection tool and 
drag it until the bottom and left sides of the text snap in place to the 
guides you created.
Your text snaps easily to the new guides because of a built-in mechanism — 
snapping. Think of snapping as turning on a magnetic force that allows objects 
to adhere to each other or to visual helpers (such as guides) to make position-
ing easier. By default, Snap Align, Snap to Guides, and Snap to Objects are 
enabled (choose View➪Snapping). You can also enable Snap to Pixels and 
Snap to Grid.

Enabling the grid
If you’ve ever drawn on graph paper, you know how fun it can be to follow 
the lines and create perfect shapes and drawings. Like good old graph paper, 
you can enable and use the Flash grid to draw and position objects and 
create precise layouts by just following the lines. Like guides, you can snap 
type, drawing objects, and symbols to gridlines. You can also draw along 
gridlines to easily measure and match shapes.
To enable the grid, choose View➪Grid➪Show Grid (see Figure 8-3). To take 
full advantage of the grid, choose View➪Snapping➪Snap to Grid to make it 
magnetic.
Follow these steps to draw and position objects with the grid:
 
1. Choose View➪Grid➪Show Grid to make sure the grid is enabled and 
choose View➪Snapping➪Snap to Grid turn on snapping for the grid.
 
2. Grab your Rectangle tool, choose a stroke color, and set the fill color 
to None.
 
3. Draw a rectangle with the gridlines as a guide.
 
 The shape snaps to the nearest gridline while you draw.
 
4. Use the Selection tool to click and drag the new shape and snap it into 
place, as shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 When you move objects along the grid, they snap by their registration 
point to the gridlines. Use the gridlines to snap the object to the exact 
position you want.
 
To customize the appearance of your grid, choose View➪Grid➪Edit Grid. 
From this dialog box, you can specify the grid’s size, color, and how accu-
rate you want the snapping to be.

Aligning Artwork
If you need to line up or space out several graphics on the stage, you can use 
the handy Align panel to assist you. The Align panel lets you line up, distrib-
ute, or space two or more objects relative to each other or the stage.
To experiment with the Align options, create a new layer, draw a shape on 
the stage, and place it on the bottom below any graphics you already have 
on the stage. Then follow these steps to align and distribute two or more 
graphics:
 
1. Select a graphic on the stage and duplicate it two to three times by 
choosing Edit➪Copy and then choosing Edit➪Paste.
 
2. Loosely position the graphics across the stage from left to right.
 
3. Select all the new copies you created with the Selection tool and 
launch the Align panel by choosing Window➪Align.
 
 The first row contains all the Align buttons, broken down into two 
groups: vertical and horizontal.

Aligning Artwork
774
 
4. Click the Align Vertical Center button to align the selected graphics 
horizontally by their top edge.
 
 The graphics reposition themselves so that they’re all flush by the top 
edge. Align the selected graphics horizontally with each other with the 
buttons under the Align row. The second row contains buttons that 
evenly distribute graphics vertically or horizontally by their center, top, 
or bottom edges.
 
5. Click the middle button of the second group (Distribute Horizontal 
Center) to distribute your graphics evenly based on their center 
points, as shown in Figure 8-5.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Distribute 
the graphics 
horizontally 
across the 
stage.
 
Distributing to the stage
The To Stage button (located on right side of the Align panel) can be enabled 
so that any distribution uses the stage as a point of reference. The distribute 
options are useful if you want to distribute objects across the full width of 
the stage regardless of their distance from each other.
To distribute objects across the stage, follow these steps:
 
1. Select two or more graphics on the stage.
 
2. Locate the To Stage button on the Align panel and click it.
 
3. Click any of the horizontal distribution buttons in the Distribute row.
 
 The graphics redistribute and spread across the full width of the stage.
Using Match Size options
If you need to resize two or more objects on the stage so that they’re all the 
same width and height, you can take advantage of the Match Size options 
in the Align panel. Match Size options can conform two objects to the same 
width, height, or both.
To match two objects in size, follow these steps:

1. Select two or more different-sized graphics, symbols, or drawing 
objects on the stage (refer to Figure 8-5).
 
2. Choose Window➪Align to launch the Align panel (if it’s not already 
open).
 
3. Locate the Match Size button group on the bottom of the panel and 
click the last button of the three (Match Width and Height).
 
 The objects resize to the same width and height, as shown in Figure 8-6.
 
 Note: You can also match only width or height by clicking either the first 
or second buttons of the group, respectively.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Match the 
width and 
height of 
two or more 
graphics.
 
 
With the Stage button enabled, Match Size resizes any selected object(s) to 
the full width and height of your stage. This is an easy way to create a full-
sized background or to stretch a graphic to fit the entire stage.
 
When using Match Size, the largest of the selected objects always dictates 
the resize. All other objects are resized to match the largest selected object.
Experimenting with Animation Helpers
Sitting discretely below the Timeline are some highly useful icons that can 
be a big help while you’re developing and fine-tuning your animations. The 
Onion Skin, Onion Skin Outlines, and Edit Multiple Frames options let you 
view, move, and manipulate entire animations at once to save time and guar-
antee better results.
When creating animation, you can enable onion skinning to view several 
frames at a time. With tweened animation, onion skinning can reveal all 
frames created in between the starting and ending keyframes to help you 
make adjustments and see them in action. You can choose between two 
types of onion skinning, depending on whether you want to view frames as 
outlines or full-color previews.

Experimenting with Animation Helpers
776
Before you get started, create a new motion tween or open a document with 
an existing tween that you can use for this example.
To enable onion skinning, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Onion Skin icon underneath the Timeline.
 
 A set of brackets appears above the Timeline.
 
2. Adjust the brackets so that all the frames in your tween are selected.
 
 You see a full preview of all the frames generated by your tween.
You can’t select the frames shown in between, but you can move the 
instances on the starting and ending keyframe. Select the symbol instance 
on the starting keyframe of your tween and move it. The onion skin reveals 
how the frames in between change when you shift your starting or ending 
instances.
As an alternative to seeing frames in your tween in full color, you can pre-
view them as outlines by using the Onion Skin Outlines option (see Figure 
8-7). This option works exactly like the Onion Skin option but shows selected 
frames using a wire frame-style outline view. The Onion Skin Outlines option 
can be a better choice if the full-color preview looks too cluttered.

(Work)flow
Using Keyboard Shortcuts
Part of creating a smooth and fast work environment is having your favorite 
commands, panels, and tools right at your fingertips. Most Flash menu items 
and panels are equipped with shortcut key combinations that provide easy 
access without the combing through several menus. If you need your own 
custom keyboard shortcuts, Flash lets you create and save keyboard short-
cut sets that you can fully customize to speed up your workflow.
To view the default keyboard shortcuts and create your own, choose 
Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts (Windows) or Flash➪Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac).
You can map almost any available tool, command, or panel to a keyboard 
shortcut. You can choose to memorize existing keyboard shortcuts for 
commonly used items or create custom keyboard shortcuts that are more 
intuitive for you.
To create a new keyboard shortcut, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts (Windows) or Flash➪Keyboard 
Shortcuts (Mac).
 
 The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box launches (see Figure 8-8).
 
2. Scroll down and click the plus sign (Windows) or triangle (Mac) to the 
left of where it reads Control.
 
 You see all menu items under the Control menu and any keyboard short-
cuts assigned to them.
 
3. Locate and select the menu command you want to create a shortcut 
for, as shown in Figure 8-8.
 
 For this example, we selected Control➪Loop Playback.
 
 The default set can’t be modified, so you’ll need to duplicate the default 
set and make changes to the new copy.
 
4. Click the Duplicate Set icon at the top of the dialog box and type My 
Custom Set in the Name text box when prompted; click OK to create 
the new set.
 
5. With the current menu item selected, locate and click the plus sign 
beside Shortcuts to add a new shortcut for the menu item.
 
 The word <empty> appears, ready for you to enter a keyboard shortcut.
 
6. Hold down Ctrl+Shift (Windows) or Ô+Shift (Mac) plus the key you 
want to assign as the keyboard shortcut (for example, Ctrl+Shift+G or 
Ô+Shift+G).

 Use a letter or a number for a keyboard shortcut. You can also use the 
Shift, Ctrl, and Alt keys (Windows) or Shift, Ô, and Option keys (Mac) in 
combination with a letter or a number to create keyboard shortcuts.
 
 You may receive a warning if the keyboard shortcut you’ve selected is 
already in use. Make sure the shortcut is not assigned to a crucial menu 
command before you decide to overwrite it.
 
 The Shortcuts text box fills in the keyboard shortcut as you hold it. Note 
that if the keyboard shortcut already exists, a warning appears.
 
7. To confirm the shortcut, click the Change button.
 
8. Click OK to exit the dialog box and save the shortcut to your new set.
 
At any time, you can return to your custom set in the Keyboard Shortcuts 
dialog box to add new shortcuts or modify existing ones. If at any point you 
want to switch sets, return to the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box and select 
a different set from the Current Set menu.
Working with the Movie Explorer
As a Flash project grows and becomes more complex, getting around 
your document can be a bit of a guessing game. As you add movie clips, 
ActionScript, media files, and more, the inner workings can overwhelm even 
the most organized of designers.

For these cases, the Movie Explorer panel (see Figure 8-9) offers an at-a-
glance view of your movie. From this panel, you see exactly what’s being 
used and where and can navigate directly to any item on the list. You can 
filter the panel to show only the types of items you want, whether it’s 
ActionScript, movie clips, sounds, or type, by clicking and selecting the 
icon buttons at the top of the panel. To launch the Movie Explorer, choose 
Window➪Movie Explorer.

✓ Choosing the right settings for your movie
✓ Creating custom publish profiles
T
o show your creations to the world, publish the final movie with the 
Publish command. Before publishing, you can use the Publish Settings 
option to specify important settings for your final movie, including quality 
and version settings as well as your choice of file formats. Different options 
let you publish for the Web, CD-ROM, and even mobile phones. We cover all 
those options in this chapter.
Getting Familiar with the Publish Process
The .fla file you build your movie in is intended for the Flash authoring 
environment only. When you’re ready to deliver a final product, create a 
final .swf (ShockWave Flash; compressed movie) file that the Flash Player 
can play. The Flash Player is responsible for displaying your movie in Web 
pages, mobile phones, and on CD-ROM (when packaged as a projector).
The Publish command, activated when you choose File➪Publish, creates 
your final .swf (often pronounced swiff), as well as additional files, such 
as .html (Web) pages that you need to display your movie in different 
environments. When the Publish process is complete, you can then upload 
the completed files to the Web, copy them to CD-ROM, or package them for 
mobile phone delivery.
Before publishing your final movie, use the Publish Settings dialog box to tell 
Flash exactly what files you want to generate and what settings to use for 
each file type. You can specify settings for every file format you choose, as 
well as quality settings for sounds and images used in your movie. The file 
types you choose depend on your movie’s final destination, whether it be the 
Web, CD-ROM, mobile devices, or standalone, kiosk-style presentation.

Selecting Your Formats
782
Selecting Your Formats
Depending on where and how you plan to distribute your movie, you can 
have Flash create a variety of different formats at publish time. Although the 
most common deployment for Flash is a SWF file and a companion HTML 
(HyperText Markup Language) file for the Web, it’s capable of generating 
files that can be used for CD-ROMs and mobile phones as well.
To choose your file formats, choose File➪Publish Settings and open the 
Publish Settings dialog box (see Figure 9-1). In the Formats tab, select the 
check box next to each format you want to create. Enter the file path in the 
text box or click the folder icon to browse to the destination (optional) for 
each file you create. By default, all files use the same name and are pub-
lished to the same location as the original .fla file.

Previewing Your Settings

Book VII
Chapter 9
Publishing 
and Final Delivery
Take a look at the different file formats you can publish and where they’re used:
 
✦ Flash (.swf): SWF is the most common file type you’ll publish; it’s what 
the Flash Player and plug-in use. Think about the Flash Player as a movie 
projector and the SWF file as a movie reel that you load onto it. When 
publishing for the Web, this is the file type you’ll choose, most often 
accompanied by an HTML (Web) page that contains it.
 
✦ HTML (.html): An HTML file, or a Web page, is used as a container for 
your Flash movie when the target venue is the Web. HTML files also can 
provide an extra level of abilities, such as checking for the Flash plug-in 
or enabling additional run-time parameters, such as looping.
 
✦ GIF Image (.gif), JPEG Image (.jpg), and PNG Image (.png): These 
selections create static images from your movie in the Web-friendly JPEG, 
GIF, and PNG formats (depending on which check box or check boxes you 
selected). You can use these images as placeholders (in the event that the 
user doesn’t have the Flash Player or plug-in) or as elements that you can 
use if you’re creating a non-Flash version of your site.
 
 Keep in mind, however, that images are generated only from the first 
frame of your movie, so exporting an image from your movie may not 
yield too much if your movie starts out blank or with minimal content.
 
✦ Windows Projector (.exe) or Macintosh Projector: A projector is 
a package that includes your movie and the Flash Player all in one. 
Projectors are commonly used for delivery on non-Web formats, such 
as CD-ROM, but you can use them for any situation where you want 
standalone distribution, such as through e-mail. Because the projector 
contains the Flash Player, your user doesn’t need anything (even the 
Flash Player installed) to view your movie. Projectors are created as EXE 
files for Windows or APP files for the Mac. If you’re delivering to users 
on both platforms, publish a projector for each.
 
 Projectors can’t be viewed in a Web browser, so they’re not a viable 
choice if you’re trying to work around requiring your users to have the 
Flash Player or plug-in.
Previewing Your Settings
Before you publish, it’s always a good idea to use Publish Preview to test the 
settings you created in the Publish Settings dialog box. Like the Test Movie 
command, Publish Preview can immediately create and display a SWF file in 
the Flash Player for immediate viewing, but that’s where the similarity ends.

Previewing Your Settings
784
Publish Preview creates a preview for any of the file formats you choose in 
the Publish Settings dialog box, including Web pages, images, and projec-
tors. The preview lets you see how these files will look before you do your 
final publish and gives you a chance to adjust your publish settings for the 
best results possible.
To preview any of your selected publish formats, choose File➪Publish 
Preview and select the format you want to preview. The default is a SWF file 
with an accompanying HTML page.
Publish Preview shows how the final movie will look in an HTML page. 
To preview an HTML and an embedded SWF file, choose File➪Publish 
Preview➪HTML.
 
Press the Publish Preview shortcut key combination Ctrl+F12 (Windows) or 
Ô+F12 (Mac) to create a preview from the default selection (HTML page and 
SWF file) at any time.
 
If HTML or SWF aren’t among your selected publish formats, the Publish 
Preview defaults to the next format you selected after choosing Publish 
Settings➪Format.
When previewing your movie with either the Test Movie or Publish Preview 
(Flash option only) command, you can use the Bandwidth Profiler. This 
graph, as shown in Figure 9-2, appears at the top of your preview window 
and shows the total file size of your movie, as well as where and how data is 
loaded as the movie plays. This step can be important in gauging whether 
the file size may be too much to download for the end user or whether you 
should distribute data-intensive items (such as sound files or images) more 
effectively across the Timeline.

Publishing for the Web
785
Book VII
Chapter 9
Publishing 
and Final Delivery
The bars across the graph appear at frames where data is loaded, and the 
height of the bar indicates how much data was loaded when the playhead 
reached that frame.
To view your movie with the Bandwidth Profiler, choose File➪Publish 
Preview➪Flash. When the movie appears in the Flash Player, choose 
View➪Bandwidth Profiler.
Publishing for the Web
If your movie’s final destination is the Web, select two necessary file for-
mats in the Publish Settings dialog box: Select the HTML (.html) and Flash 
(.swf) check boxes. The HTML file (or Web page) acts as a container for 
your SWF file, displaying it in the browser and placing it against a matching 
background. This HTML file also contains code that sets additional options 
in your movie at run time (such as instructions to loop automatically).
Playback of the actual SWF file is handled by the Flash Player, which works 
as a plug-in for all major Web browsers.
Uploading your files to the Web with FTP
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the method used 
to connect and transfer files between your local 
computer and a remote Web server and is the 
most common way of posting your finished files 
onto the Web for the public to see.
FTP connections occur between your com-
puter and a server that opens the connection 
to receive the files. Servers often are main-
tained by a hosting company that provides you 
an account and a space for your Web site files. 
You may also be posting your work to a network 
machine or a dedicated server maintained by 
your company. Flash doesn’t have FTP capabili-
ties, but there are many FTP programs are out 
there that vary in price and features that you 
can install on your computer.
Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 includes full FTP func-
tionality and can create and store connections to 
several different servers or hosting accounts. If 
you want a more basic (and free) option, you can 
connect to a Web server via FTP directly from 
Windows Explorer or choose the Go➪Connect 
to Server option in the Finder on Macintosh OS 
X. Alternately, browsers such as Firefox sup-
port cool, free add-ons such as FireFTP. In most 
applications, copying files to and from the server 
is as simple as dragging and dropping from one 
window to another.
Remember: In order to connect to a server, you 
need to purchase or have access to a Web-
hosting account, network computer, or dedi-
cated server. Most FTP connections require a 
user ID and password; check with your server 
administrator or hosting company to get infor-
mation for your specific account.

Publishing for CD-ROM
786
When you publish your final movie and HTML file, you upload both files to 
your Web-hosting account, company server, or wherever your movie needs 
to go to make it available for public viewing.
To publish the necessary files for the Web viewing, choose File➪Publish 
Settings and select the HTML (.html) and Flash (.swf) check boxes on 
the Formats tab. Click the Publish button to create the final files that you’ll 
upload to your Web server of choice.
Publishing for CD-ROM
Flash’s ability to include full-featured video, audio, and graphics has made it 
a very popular choice for creating CD-ROM based presentations, e-brochures, 
learning materials, and interactive application installers. When packaging 
for a CD-ROM, consider that a SWF file alone may not be enough, especially 
because it’s possible that users won’t have a standalone version of the Flash 
Player installed on their computers.
For this reason, you can package movies for CD-ROM as projectors. (See the sec-
tion “Selecting Your Formats,” earlier in this chapter, for more on projectors.)
To create standalone projectors for Mac and/or Windows, select the 
Windows Projector (.exe) and/or Macintosh Projector check boxes on the 
Formats tab of the Publish Settings dialog box. The projector(s) are created 
when you publish, along with other formats you’ve chosen. These projectors 
can then be copied to and distributed on a CD or a DVD.
Choosing the Right Settings
After you pick the file types you want to publish, you can specify settings for 
each selected format in the Publish Settings dialog box. Make sure that you 
take time to familiarize yourself with the available options and experiment 
with different settings until you get a finished movie that’s just right.
 
Flash stores publish settings as part of your document, so you need to set 
these settings only once for each Flash movie. Make sure to save your movie 
after you choose your publish settings so that your settings are available the 
next time you open the document.
Choosing settings for Flash (.swf) files
SWF files are compressed movies used by the Flash Player for display on the 
Web or directly on a user’s computer. When you choose to publish a SWF 
file, you have the opportunity to specify settings that determine version, 
security, and quality.

Choosing the Right Settings
787
Book VII
Chapter 9
Publishing 
and Final Delivery
The Flash settings are available on the Flash tab in the Publish Settings 
dialog box (see Figure 9-3). (First, make sure you select the Flash [.swf] 
check box on the Formats tab.) The following list takes a look at some of 
the settings you’ll work with and how each one affects the performance and 
quality of your Flash movie:
 
✦ Player: This drop-down list controls which version of the Flash Player 
your movie is created for. In most cases, you want to select the latest 
version, Flash Player 10, so that you can take advantage of the player’s 
latest features. In some cases, you may need to publish your movie to 
be compatible with a previous version of the Flash Player; here, you can 
specify versions as far back as Flash Player 1. You can also publish your 
movies for Adobe AIR, as well as Flash Lite, a version of the Flash player 
developed for mobile devices.
 
✦ Script: What you choose in this drop-down list is completely dependent 
on which version of ActionScript (if any) you’re working with. Because 
each version contains differences in both features and structure (par-
ticularly between ActionScript 3.0 and previous versions), publish in the 
version you’ve used throughout your movie. If your movie doesn’t use 
any ActionScript, leave the default setting for the Flash Player version 
you choose.
 
 Chapter 7 of this minibook discusses ActionScript and the differences 
between Versions 2.0 and 3.0.
 
✦ JPEG Quality: Flash performs a certain amount of compression on 
bitmap graphics in your movie (such as imported photos) to reduce file 
size and increase performance. Use this slider to determine the amount 
of compression applied and, in turn, the resulting file size and quality of 
your movie. The higher the quality, the less compression applied, and 
the larger the resulting file size.
 
✦ Audio Stream and Audio Event: If your movie includes sound, you can 
set the quality of the sound in your final SWF file by clicking the Set 
button beside either Audio Streams or Audio Events. By default, sound 
is converted to 16 khz, mono MP3 format, but you can change both com-
pression and quality settings as needed. Keep in mind that, like the JPEG 
quality settings, higher quality settings for sound likely increases the 
overall file size of your movie.
 
 Chapter 5 of this minibook discusses stream and event sounds.
 
✦ SWF Settings area: In previous versions of Flash, hidden layers were pub-
lished by default to your final movie. This behavior can be toggled off by 
selecting the Include Hidden Layers check box to insure that layers that 
are turned off in your FLA file won’t show in the resulting SWF file.
 
 The Compress Movie check box, which is selected by default, com-
presses your SWF file to reduce the file size and, in turn, the download 
time. Leave this check box selected, especially if your file is ActionScript 
or text intensive.

Choosing the Right Settings
788
 
✦ Advanced area: The Flash authoring software can’t open or decompile 
SWF files for editing, but it can import them as frame-by-frame movies 
into a FLA document. This opens the door for artwork and graphic 
resources to be extracted, perhaps against your will. Selecting the 
Protect from Import check box prevents SWF files from being imported 
into the Flash authoring environment. The Password text box below the 
check boxes becomes active when the Protect from Import check box is 
selected so that you can assign a password to allow only certain parties 
(such as a colleague or client, for example) to import the SWF file if they 
need to.

tab is

selected 
publish 
formats.
 
Choosing settings for HTML files
For presentation on the Web, publish an HTML file that contains your SWF file. 
This HTML file not only displays your movie, but also includes all the code 
necessary to control dimensions, appearance, and run-time options (such 
as telling your movie to loop). Your HTML file features the same background 
color as your movie so that it matches seamlessly when viewed in a browser.

Choosing the Right Settings
789
Book VII
Chapter 9
Publishing 
and Final Delivery
Select the HTML (.html) check box in the Formats tab of the Publish 
Settings dialog box and then click the HTML tab. On the HTML tab, you can 
choose from the following options for your published HTML file:
 
✦ Template: This setting generates your HTML file based on different 
possible environments, such as standard browsers, Pocket PCs, or addi-
tional options for full-screen support.
 
 For any template selected, an AC_RunActiveContent.js file is cre-
ated. Copy this file to your Web server with any other files generated. 
This file is a workaround for recent changes to Internet Explorer’s han-
dling of active content.
 
✦ Detect Flash Player Version check box: This option adds code in your 
HTML file to display alternate content if the end user doesn’t have the 
Flash Player installed. You can customize this content in any HTML 
editor. The default content provides a link for the user to download and 
install the latest version of Flash Player.
 
✦ Dimensions: The code in your HTML file specifies a size for your Flash 
movie, which, by default, matches your movie’s actual dimensions. 
You can override this setting and force your movie to a different size in 
either pixels or percent by typing values in the Width and Height text 
boxes.
 
✦ Playback: Check boxes in this area set run-time options for your Flash 
movie. By default, the Flash Player is directed to loop movies and to 
make the contextual menu available to the user. You can disable either 
of these features, as well as force the movie to pause at the start, or use 
device fonts (fonts from the end user’s machine instead of embedded 
fonts).
 
✦ Quality: Controls the overall display quality of your movie by allowing 
you to select a Low, Medium, or High quality setting from the provided 
drop-down list.
 
✦ Window Mode: This drop-down list lets you choose how Flash appears 
in context of your Web page. You can set Flash movies to be opaque or 
transparent to reveal the background of the page.
 
✦ HTML Alignment: Select a Left, Right, Top, or Bottom alignment of your 
movie as determined by the HTML code using the provided drop-down 
list.
 
✦ Scale: This drop-down list lets you choose if the HTML page scales the 
Flash movie to a size other than its default size.
 
✦ Flash alignment: This option controls the positioning of your Flash 
movie within the page. Use the drop-down lists to select Vertical and/or 
Horizontal alignment values.

Creating Publish Profiles
790
Creating Publish Profiles
If you want to use the same publish settings across multiple movies, you 
can capture your settings as a profile that you can recall and use in other 
documents.
To create a new publish profile, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Publish Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box 
(refer to Figure 9-1).
 
2. Select your formats and choose your settings as described earlier in 
this chapter.
 
 3. Locate the Create New Profile icon in the upper-right corner of the 
dialog box and click it.
 
 The Create New Profile dialog box appears, prompting you to assign the 
new profile a name.
 
4. Enter the profile name in the Profile name text box and click OK.
 
 The profile is created and is an available option under the Current 
Profile drop-down list at the top of the Publish Settings dialog box.
To make your profile available to other documents, export it:
 
1. Choose File➪Publish Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box.
 
 2. Choose Export from the Import/Export icon at the top of the Publish 
Settings dialog box.
 
 You’re prompted to name and save your profile (stored as a separate 
.xml file). Although you can save the file anywhere, it’s best to keep it 
in the Flash application’s Publish Profiles folder, which is the default 
location.
 
3. Assign the XML file a name by typing it in the Save As text box, choose 
a Save location, and click Save.
To import a profile from another document, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Publish Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box.
 
2. Choose Import from the Import/Export icon at the top of the dialog box.
 
 The Import Profile dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-4.
 
3. Locate the XML file you created when you exported the profile and 
click Open.
 
 The profile is now available under the Current Profiles drop-down list at 
the top of the Publish Settings dialog box.

Additional resources
One of the great things about working with Flash 
is the community that supports it. Countless 
Web sites are dedicated to Flash tutorials, 
training videos, example files, free resources 
(such as fonts and sounds), and forums to dis-
cuss and assist developers of all levels with a 
variety of Flash help topics.
There are too many to list them all, but here’s 
a short list of established and highly visited 
sites that can get you started. (Note: This isn’t 
a complete list, nor is it an endorsement of 
any specific Web site. These Web sites have 
been shown to be reputable and highly useful 
resources for Flash developers. You’re encour-
aged to be a part of the Flash community by uti-
lizing and contributing to these and other online 
resources to further your own knowledge.)

Fireworks CS4
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding when you should use Fireworks
✓ Discovering the workspace
✓ Finding out about the tools
✓ Looking into the views
✓ Using the basic selection tools
A
dobe Fireworks is an incredible application with specific solutions to 
meet online designers’ needs. With Fireworks, you have the freedom 
to create test Web sites, experiment with advanced scripting features, and 
come up with compelling graphics that look good and work well on Web 
pages.
In this chapter, you encounter the software and its workspace. You also dis-
cover how to use selection tools so that you can start to manipulate graphics 
in Fireworks right away.
Why Use Fireworks?
With all the applications included in the Creative Suite, why do you need 
one more? The reason is mostly because after CS2 (and the removal of 
ImageReady), the Creative Suite provided no easy way to create interest-
ing Web graphics. Sure, you can save images for online use in Photoshop 
and Illustrator using the Save for Web & Devices feature, but what about 
rollovers, easy image maps, and interactive wireframes? (A wireframe is a 
low-fidelity mock-up, page-schematic rough draft. In Web design, wireframes 
are basic visual guides used to suggest the layout and placement of funda-
mental design elements.)
With Fireworks, you can work intuitively by taking advantage of the logi-
cal interface. This interface provides panels and features that relate to the 
Web and that offer you the easiest way to optimize (make Web-ready) your 
graphics.

So what’s the big deal about Fireworks being built specifically for Web 
graphics? Well, first of all, you are working strictly with pixels — no messy 
dpi (dots per inch) or lpi (lines per inch), which are typical printing terms.
Figure 1-1 shows the dialog box that appears when you choose File➪Open 
to open a vector graphic from Illustrator. The dialog box offers conversion 
choices but emphasizes pixel dimensions.

When you’re working with Web images, it’s a good idea to know the approxi-
mate width, in pixels, of your final page. Typical Web pages range all the 
way from 650 to 1,000 pixels wide, but most designers stick with a page built 
to span approximately 800 pixels. When you create images, you must think 
about how they will fit within the context of your total page. An image 600 
pixels wide would take up most of your page, whereas one that’s 1,200 pixels 
wide would force the viewer to scroll to see the entire image.
Touring the workspace
Upon launching Fireworks CS4, you notice right away that its workspace is 
similar to the workspaces in the other CS4 applications. Adobe has done a 
good job of organizing each application so that the learning curve is quick 
and integration is easy.
You shouldn’t be surprised to find a toolbox to the left of the workspace and 
panels to the right. The tools even look very much like the tools you may 
already be familiar with from working in other CS4 applications.

Understanding the views
The tabs at the top of an image give you the opportunity to view it in four ways:
 
✦ Original displays your image as it appears before being optimized for 
the Web.
 
✦ Preview displays the image as it will appear when it’s saved for the Web, 
based on your current settings. (You find out more about those settings 
in Chapter 5 of this minibook.)
 
✦ 2-Up offers the opportunity to see your image in two windows, with dif-
ferent settings applied in each window. Most users tend to compare the 
original and optimized images in this view (see Figure 1-2).
 
✦ 4-Up is for those who are never quite sure which is the best way to opti-
mize an image. You don’t necessarily need to compare different formats 
when you use this view; you can experiment with different options for 
one format, such as pushing the limit with the amount of colors you 
want to keep in a GIF, as shown in Figure 1-3.

Investigating the panels
Not unlike the other CS4 applications, Fireworks lets you detach panels from 
the docking area on the right side of the workspace. Because this procedure 
is so similar to the methods you use to dock and undock panels in other CS4 
applications, we won’t bore you with the details here.
 
If you can’t locate a panel, choose its name from the Window menu.

Working with basic selection tools
You can work in Fireworks using the same selection tools for both vector 
and bitmap images.
Making a selection with the Marquee 
and Lasso tools
If you are familiar with Photoshop selection techniques, you will have no 
problem using the same tools in Fireworks.
To make a selection with the Marquee tool, simply select the tool from the 
Tools panel, and then click and drag to surround the area that you want to 
select.
You can add to the selection by holding down the Shift key and dragging 
another marquee region, or deselect some of the active selection by hold-
ing down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key while dragging with the 
Marquee tool.
To use the Lasso tool, select the Lasso tool from the Tools panel and click 
and drag to create a path that will then become your selection. As men-
tioned in the Marquee tool, you can add to the selection by holding down 
the Shift key and creating another selection region, or subtract from the 
selection by holding down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key while 
dragging a selection region with the Lasso tool.
 
You can use both the Marquee and Lasso tools interchangeably when 
making a selection.
By making a selection with the Marquee or Lasso tool and then clicking 
and dragging with the Pointer tool, you can move one part of an image to 
another, as shown in Figure 1-4. If you make no selection before you drag, 
everything on the existing layer is moved.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Drag a 
selection 
to move it.
 
Switch to the Subselection tool, and notice that if you have an existing selec-
tion, the pointer changes to a double arrow. This double arrow indicates 
that you will clone (copy) the selection when you click and drag it.

Jumping Right into the Interface
802
Making a selection in a vector image
With the same tools you use to select bitmap images, you can adjust vector 
paths. Use the Pointer tool to move an entire vector shape, as shown in 
Figure 1-5.
 
Figure 1-5: 
The Pointer 
tool lets 
you move 
a vector 
shape.
 
Use the Subselection tool to move the individual points on the path.

In This Chapter
✓ Understanding layers in Fireworks
✓ Finding the difference between vector and bitmap images
✓ Using the bitmap and vector drawing tools
✓ Discovering masking
You can easily import graphics into Fireworks from the other Creative 
Suite 4 applications or create your own graphics. Fireworks comes with 
a full set of tools for creating both bitmap and vector images. This chapter 
briefly discusses bitmap and vector graphics; you can find out more by 
reading Book I, Chapter 6.
Knowing What Happens in Layers
Create a new document by choosing File➪New. If the Layers panel is not 
visible, choose Window➪Layers. By default, the Layers panel contains two 
layers: Web Layer and Layer 1.
Web Layer is reserved for Web objects, such as hotspots, slices, and other 
interactive objects. You can’t delete, duplicate, or rename objects in this 
layer. You find out more about the Web Layer in Chapter 6 of this minibook.
You also have Layer 1 as a default layer. Everything that you create or 
import, whether it’s a bitmap or a vector graphic, lands here, essentially 
becoming a sublayer of Layer 1.
You can rename both main layers and sublayers. You can also reposition, 
delete, and duplicate them by using the tools at the bottom of the Layers 
panel (see Figure 2-1).
Understanding this layer organization and how it relates to drawing in 
Fireworks is important. When you use bitmap tools to paint and create 
pixels, everything falls onto one layer, much as you would expect. But when 
you start creating vector shapes, every new shape lands on a new layer. 
This arrangement makes it easier for you to move the shapes independently 
but can be confusing to new Fireworks users at first.

Choosing Vector or Bitmap Graphics
If you haven’t read enough about vector versus bitmap graphics before this 
minibook, you get even more information in this section.
Fireworks lets you work in a painterly fashion with the bitmap tools. These 
tools work like the brush and retouching tools in Photoshop, in that they 
are pixel based. You can use the bitmap tools to create smoother transitions 
and more realistic contours and shapes.
So why not use bitmap images for all your artwork? One drawback is that 
bitmap images tend to be a little larger in file size than vector images. Also, 
bitmap images aren’t scalable, as vector graphics are. Sometimes, it’s fairly 
clear when to use a bitmap instead of a vector image; see Figure 2-2 for an 
example.
Most designers use bitmap images for more realistic artwork, such as photo-
realistic renderings, and vector images for more graphical artwork, such as 
stylized buttons and logos.
 
No matter whether you use bitmap or vector drawing tools to create a 
graphic, it will be a bitmap image when it’s optimized (saved for the Web). 
Even if you use vector drawing tools in Fireworks, you see the graphic 
broken into pixels in the preview windows.

Creating with Bitmap Tools
The first set of tools that we investigate in this chapter are the bitmap tools: 
Marquee, Lasso, Magic Wand, Brush, Pencil, Eraser, Blur, and Rubber Stamp. 
We cover these tools briefly, focusing on the differences between using them 
in Fireworks and in other bitmap applications, such as Photoshop. If you 
don’t see the Tools panel, choose Window➪Tools.
The selection tools let you grab hold of pixels. You use the Marquee tool, 
for example, to select a section of pixels that you want to move, clone, or 
change in some way. To experiment with the Marquee tool, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New to create a new Fireworks document.
 
 The New dialog box appears.
 
2. Type 500 in both the Width and Height text boxes; leave Canvas set to 
White; then click OK.
 
 A new blank document opens.
 
3. With the Marquee tool, click and drag in the workspace from top left 
to bottom right to create a rectangular marquee.
 
4. Choose File➪Swatches to open the Swatches panel.

Creating with Bitmap Tools
806
 
5. Click any color you want to use for the fill of your selection.
 
6. Click the Paint Bucket tool (in the Colors section of the Tools panel) 
and then click inside your selection marquee to fill it with your 
selected color.
You’ve successfully created a bitmap graphic in Fireworks. In the next sec-
tion, you use other bitmap tools to make changes in this artwork.
Moving pixels
In this section, you use the Marquee tool to move the pixels to another loca-
tion. If you’re a Photoshop user, notice that the Marquee tool works just like 
the selection tools in Photoshop.
To move the graphic you just selected, follow these steps:
 
1. With the Marquee tool, click and drag over the bottom of your bitmap 
rectangle.
 
2. Select the Pointer tool and then drag the marquee down, as shown in 
Figure 2-3.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Move a 
selection 
with the 
Pointer tool.
 
Changing the way pixels appear
If you’ve followed along, you know how to select and move pixels and you’re 
ready to change the way selected pixels appear. To do that, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose Select➪Deselect, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+D 
(Windows) or Ô+D (Mac), to make sure that there are no active 
selections.
 
2. Hold down the Marquee tool to select the hidden Oval tool.
 
3. Holding down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key, click and drag 
from the center of the rectangle that you created (see the top of 
Figure 2-4).

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Free to Create

Figure 2-4:

feathered, 
oval 
selection.
 
 
 Many of the shortcuts you use in Illustrator and Photoshop also work in 
Fireworks . . . but not all. Finding compatible shortcuts is sort of hit-or-
miss when you’re in the beginning stage with Fireworks. You can choose 
Help➪Fireworks Help and select Preferences and Keyboard Shortcuts in 
the list of topics on the left side of the Help window for details.
 
4. To feather (soften) the edges of the selection, choose Feather from the 
Edge drop-down list in the Properties panel and set a feathering value 
(10 pixels is the default) in the combo box to the right of the Edge 
drop-down list, as shown in the middle of Figure 2-4.
 
 The bottom of Figure 2-4 shows the result.
Using additional bitmap tools
You’ll also use some additional bitmap tools:
 
✦ Brush: The Brush tool lets you paint just like you would in Photoshop, and 
you can mix it up with the selection tools to create interesting artwork.
 
 Options for the Brush tool — such as size, softness, and transparency —
are located in the Properties panel at the bottom of the workspace. 
Unfortunately, not all the great brush shortcuts in Photoshop work in 
Fireworks, so you may have to access the Properties panel in Fireworks 
more often than you may be used to.

Creating with Vector Tools
808
 
✦ Editing tools: Because you are working with pixels, you can edit those 
pixels rather easily.
 
• Pencil: Use the Pencil tool to add detail.
 
• Blur: The Blur tool softens edges.
 
• Eraser: The Eraser tool eliminates pixels.
 
✦ Rubber Stamp: The Rubber Stamp tool is similar to the one in Photoshop, 
and you use it the same way. Simply Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click 
(Mac) a bitmap source that you want to clone; then release the Alt/Option 
key and start painting somewhere else in the image area. The source is 
re-created or cloned as you paint with the Rubber Stamp tool.
If you make a mistake, you can undo multiple steps in Fireworks by press-
ing Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ô+Z (Mac) repeatedly. If you want to redo a step 
(essentially undoing an undo), press Ctrl+Y (Windows) or Ô+Y (Mac).
Creating with Vector Tools
The Vector tools in Fireworks are similar to the ones you may be used to 
in Illustrator or Photoshop. What you should notice right off the bat in 
Fireworks is that every time you create a new vector shape with one of the 
vector tools (such as Line, Pen, Shape, or Type), Fireworks creates a new 
sublayer automatically. This arrangement lets you move the shapes freely 
and independently.
 
Before repositioning or making other transformations in your vector images, 
confirm which sublayer is active by looking for the highlighted sublayer in 
the Layers panel. Otherwise, you may unexpectedly move the wrong image.
Using shape tools
To use a shape tool, simply click it and drag in the workspace. A shape is 
created, and a new sublayer is added automatically in the Layers panel.
In addition to the basic shape tools, Fireworks has more shapes that are 
useful for designing buttons, icons, and other Web graphics. To find these 
shapes, click and hold the Rectangle tool in the Tools panel. Hidden shape 
tools appear such as stars, arrows, and beveled rectangles, to name a few.
After you create a shape using a shape tool, you can edit it by using the 
Pointer and Subselection tools as follows:

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Free to Create
Creating with Vector Tools
809
 
✦ Pointer: If you need to reposition the shape, select the Pointer tool, and 
click and drag it to a new location. You can also grab the highlighted 
anchor points to resize the shape.
 
✦ Subselection: If you need to make more defined shape changes (such 
as changing the corner radius, bevel, or overall shape of the vector 
graphic), you want to switch to the Subselection tool. This tool works 
very much like the Select and Direct Select tools in Illustrator and 
Photoshop.
Creating a path
The most popular vector tool in most applications is the Pen tool. Using this 
tool in a freeform manner, you can create any shape you want (including the 
type you need to make a button look like it has a reflection, for example) or 
create your own custom graphics.
Fireworks offers three types of path tools, as shown in Figure 2-5:
 
✦ The Pen tool works much like other Pen tools. You create a path by 
clicking from one location to another (creating anchor points) or by 
clicking and dragging to create curved sections of paths.
 
✦ The Vector Path tool lets you click and drag in a painterly fashion to 
create a path.
 
✦ The Redraw Path tool lets you reshape a path (by dragging it over an 
existing path) while maintaining the original stroke information.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Create 
paths in 
Fireworks 
with three 
tools.
 
Changing an existing path
If you have a hard time using the Pen tool or want to make freeform adjust-
ments, you can get really great results by using the Freeform tool.
 
When you use the Freeform tool or some of the other hidden path tools 
(refer to the “Using shape tools” section, earlier in this chapter), you may 
get a warning message, essentially indicating that you could get unexpected 
results, as shown in Figure 2-6. Click OK, and cross your fingers.

Creating with Vector Tools
810
 
Figure 2-6: 
You may 
get an error 
when you 
use the 
Freeform 
tool.
 
To use the Freeform tool with an existing path active (select it with the 
Pointer tool), follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Freeform tool to select it; then click and drag in the work-
space to change the way the path looks.
 
 You can bend the path in different smooth directions.
 
2. In the Properties panel, set options to specify the width of the change.
Another tool hidden in the Freeform tool is the Reshape Area tool, which 
is handy for reshaping existing paths (see Figure 2-7). This tool lets you set 
a reshape size area in the Properties panel and then edit selected paths by 
clicking and dragging over them.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Change 
existing 
paths with 
the Reshape 
Area tool.
 
The additional path-scrubber tools let you edit paths that have pressure-
sensitive strokes. In fact if you did not have paths created using a pressure-
sensitive device, you cannot use these tools.

Working with type
Feel free to scale your text to your heart’s delight; text is vector! To create 
text in your image area, simply select the Text tool, click to set your inser-
tion point, and then start typing. Use the Properties panel to change the 
font and size, as well as other text attributes. Chapter 4 in this minibook dis-
cusses text and its formatting capabilities.
Masking: Going Beyond Tape
You can mask in Fireworks, but you don’t use quite the same method that 
you’d use in Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign. The result is essentially the 
same, however.
A mask lets you choose which part of a graphic is exposed and which part is 
covered (by the mask). See Figure 2-8 for an example of two vector graphics 
that have been masked with a gradient fill to fade the transparency from 100 
percent to none.
 
Figure 2-8: 
An example 
of two 
vector 
shapes 
with masks 
applied to 
them.
 
To apply a gradient mask, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a vector shape (such as an arrow).
 
2. In the Layers panel, choose Add Mask from the panel menu.
 
 A blank mask appears to the right of the vector shape’s sublayer, as 
shown in Figure 2-9.
 
3. With the new mask active, click and hold the Paint Bucket tool to 
select the hidden Gradient tool.

Masking: Going Beyond Tape
812
 
Figure 2-9: 
Adding a 
mask to a 
sublayer.
 
 
4. With the Gradient tool, click and drag across the shape to make the 
gradient on the mask and create the transparency effect on the vector 
shape.
 
 Notice that where the gradient is darker, the image is less visible, and 
where the gradient is lighter, the vector shape is more visible, as shown 
in Figure 2-10.
 
Figure 2-10: 
The arrow 
shows 
through 
more where 
the gradient 
is lighter.
 
You can experiment with this effect on other shapes. Also, you can try click-
ing and dragging the gradient until you get the depth and direction you want.
 
A gradient tends to work better as a mask if you use its default colors: black 
and white.

L
ike most other Creative Suite applications, Fireworks lets you define an 
object’s fill and stroke. You can use some unique tools for that selec-
tion, as well as some hidden features that work slightly differently from 
what you may be used to.
In this chapter, you find out how to get the fill or stroke color you want applied 
to your artwork, and you discover the basics of working with gradient fills.
Choosing Web Colors
Colors appear different on a monitor from the way they do when you view 
them off-screen, but this issue isn’t as serious now as it was in the past. 
Years ago, you had to base your color selections on the lowest common 
denominator. Today, most viewers have monitors that can display thou-
sands, if not millions, of colors.
 
When you’re choosing a color for the Web, it’s best not to fret over the 
exactness of a color when viewed on different monitors unless precision is 
critical. Critical color could apply to your company logo or to fabrics that 
viewers might be comparing onscreen.
In Fireworks, you can choose color from several panels, with each panel 
offering a different model from which to create your colors. Even though 
you are working in RGB (Red, Green, Blue), you can still enter CMYK (Cyan, 
Magenta, Yellow, Key or Black) or HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) values.

Finding Colors in Fireworks
814
Finding Colors in Fireworks
Perhaps you want to create a simple shape with a fill, which seems easy, but 
if you are unfamiliar with Fireworks, you may need a little direction to get 
this task done.
You can find most of Fireworks’s color functions in the Colors section of the 
Tools panel. This section features an Eyedropper tool for sampling color, as 
well as color boxes that make it easy for you to stroke and fill both bitmap 
and vector graphics.
You can set additional attributes for color in the Properties panel, including 
textures that you can apply from the Texture drop-down list.
Applying Colors to Objects
To create and color an object, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New to create a new blank document.
 
2. Create a path or a shape with the bitmap or vector drawing tools and 
leave that object selected.
 
3. To apply a fill color, click the Fill Color box located at the Colors sec-
tion of the Tools panel and then click the color you want to apply 
from the pop-up Swatches panel (see Figure 3-1).
 
4. To apply a stroke color, click the Stroke Color box in the Tools panel 
and then click the color you want to apply from the pop-up Swatches 
panel.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Take 
advantage

Adding Colors to Fireworks
Assigning a fill or stroke color to graphics is relatively simple. But what if the 
color you want to use isn’t in the default Swatches panel? In that case, you 

Adding Colors to Fireworks
815

Chapter 3
Livening Up Your 
Artwork with Color
need to create a color and add it to the panel. You can accomplish this task 
in several ways. In the following sections, we cover using the Eyedropper 
tool and the color palette.
Adding a color with the Eyedropper tool
The Eyedropper tool is useful when you have a color to sample. Just select 
the tool, click any color (in your working document or in any other open 
Fireworks document), and then choose Window➪Swatches. When the 
Swatches panel pops up, click an empty area, and your sample color is added.
 
To remove a color from the Swatches panel, position your mouse pointer 
over the color that you want to delete, and press Ctrl+Alt (Windows) or 
Ô+Option (Mac). When the scissors pointer appears, click the mouse; the 
color is deleted.
Adding a color with the color palette
The color palette is a dynamic and fun way to set color. It consists of three 
tabs, each tab offering the opportunity to choose a stroke or fill color and a 
different method of selecting that color.
You can open the Color palette by choosing Windows➪Others➪Color Palette.
The three color palette tabs are
 
✦ Selector: The Selector tab (see Figure 3-2) lets you pick a color in any 
of four color models: HLS (hue, lightness, saturation), HSV, CMYK, and 
RGB. Click the large color panel and then enter color values by using the 
sliders or text boxes at the bottom. To adjust the tonal value, use the 
slider to the right of the large color panel.

✦ Mixers: The Mixers tab (see Figure 3-3) lets you assign multiple colors 
by using the color wheel. You can also create a tint build at the bottom 
of the window so that you can build combinations of colors. In addition, 
you can export the colors as a bitmap or a table using the Export but-
tons on the left side of the Mixer tab, which makes it easy to reference 
them later.
 
✦ Blender: The Blender tab (see Figure 3-4) lets you select two colors and 
then view and choose combinations of those colors.

Y
ou definitely don’t want to attempt to create a brochure in Fireworks, 
but you can take advantage of its excellent capabilities to format your 
on-screen text. Whether you’re working with paragraphs or single lines of 
text, you have lots of options for fonts, styles, and interesting effects. In this 
chapter, you find out where to find the features you need to get the words 
looking just the way you like them.
Creating Text
You can create text in either of two ways:
 
✦ Select the Type tool, click in the image area, and begin typing.
 
✦ Copy (or cut) text from another application, select the Type tool, and 
paste it on the artboard.
 
In a hurry? You can select text from one application and then click and drag 
it into the Fireworks workspace.

Setting Text Attributes
820
Setting Text Attributes
Text can create mood and feeling, so you want to make sure you have the 
right font and style for your message. You can apply text attributes via two 
main methods: the Type menu or the Properties panel. In this chapter, you 
use the Properties panel (see Figure 4-1), as it provides an easier method for 
locating text attributes. If your Properties panel isn’t visible at the bottom of 
the Fireworks workspace, choose Window➪Properties.
Whether you use the Type menu or Properties panel, you can set your text 
attributes with the Properties panel either before or after you enter text.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Choose 
font, size, 
and other 
attributes.
 
 
The same rule applies in Fireworks as in all other applications: You have to 
select it to affect it. Before you apply any attributes, use the Pointer tool to 
select the text you want to format.
To set text attributes with the Properties panel, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text that you want to format.
 
2. Choose a font from the Font drop-down list and then choose a style 
from the Style drop-down list.
 
 If you don’t see your favorite font in bold, you can take advantage of the 
Bold button to create faux bold text (not really the bold font, but kind of 
close). The same trick works with the Italic button.
 
3. To assign color, click the color selector box to the right of the Size 
drop-down list and then choose a color from the pop-up Swatches 
panel.
Fine-Tuning Spacing, Alignment, and Orientation
Unfortunately, Fireworks’s text controls leave much to be desired compared 
with the other Creative Suite applications. But if you want to fine-tune your 
text, you might consider adjusting the spacing between characters or lines.

Adding Effects
821
Book VIII
Chapter 4
Creating Text in 
Fireworks
Sliders are available in the Properties panel for adjusting the kerning (spac-
ing between two characters), tracking (spacing between multiple letters), 
and leading (spacing between lines of text). Select the text you want to 
format, adjust the slider as shown in Figure 4-2, and then click off the slider 
to confirm the change.
 
Kerning and tracking are controlled using the same Kerning tool. To kern 
between two letters, insert the cursor between the two letters before making 
a change. To adjust tracking, select multiple letters before making a change.

To align selected text, click the Left, Center, Right, or Justified alignment 
button in the Properties panel.
You can also change the orientation of selected text by clicking the Set Text 
Orientation button, shown in Figure 4-3.

Adding Effects
Spunk up your text by adding Live Effects from Photoshop. You can add 
drop shadows or 3D effects, or even make your text look like wood!
To add effects to your text, follow these steps:
 
1. With the Pointer tool, select your text and then click the Add Filters 
button in the Properties panel.

3. In the list on the left side of the dialog box, check the effect that you 
want to apply.
 
4. Set the related options on the right side of the dialog box and click OK.
 
 The effects are applied to your text, as shown in Figure 4-5.

You’ve heard it before, but we have to say it again: Just because you can do 
something doesn’t mean that you always should. Translation: Don’t apply all 
these effects to your text at the same time.
Giving Your Text Some Style
You can choose among an array of interesting default styles to apply to both 
objects and text. You can also create your own styles — an extremely helpful 
capability when text needs to be consistent throughout an entire Web site.
Styles are applied to the entire text area.

Creating your own style
Save yourself time by applying all the text attributes you need to get your 
text looking just right.
To create a custom style, follow these steps:
 
1. Select your text and apply all the formatting and effects that you want 
to use, following the procedures described earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Choose Window➪Styles to display the Styles panel.
 
3. With the Style Category drop-down list, choose the category that you 
want the style to be saved in.
 
4. Click the New Style button in the bottom-right corner.
 
 The New Style dialog box appears.

824
 
5. Type an appropriate name for the style in the Name text box.
 
6. Check the attributes that you want to save and click OK.
 
 You have a saved style that you can apply to selected text at any time.
Spell-Checking Your Text
Checking your spelling is simple, right? It certainly is simple in Fireworks, so 
you have no excuse for typographical errors.
To check the spelling of your text in Fireworks, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Text➪Spelling Setup.
 
 The Spelling Setup dialog box appears.
 
2. Choose the language that you want to use for the spelling check.
 
3. Set any other options you want to use and click OK.
 
4. Choose Text➪Check Spelling.
 
 The Check Spelling dialog box appears with the first questionable spell-
ing highlighted.
 
If you want to add any unique words in your document to the spell-checking 
dictionary, click the Add to Personal button in the top-right corner of the 
Check Spelling dialog box.
Attaching Text to a Path
Add some excitement by attaching text to a path. In Figure 4-7, the text is 
attached to a curvy path, but you could just as easily create angled text or 
text that follows a circle.
 
Figure 4-7: 
You can 
make text 
curve by

Outlining Text
825
Book VIII
Chapter 4
Creating Text in 
Fireworks
Follow these steps to attach text to a path:
 
1. Select the text that you want to attach to the path.
 
2. Create a path with the Pen, Line, or Shape tool.
 
 See Chapter 2 in this minibook for details on creating a path.
 
3. With the Pointer tool, select the text area and then Shift-click the path.
 
 Both the text and the path are selected.
 
4. Choose Text➪Attach to Path.
 
 If you want the text to run inside a shape, such as a circle, choose 
Text➪Attach in Path.
To change the orientation of the attached text on the path, choose Text➪
Orientation and then choose an orientation option from the submenu. In 
Figure 4-8, the orientation has been changed to Skew Vertical.
 
Figure 4-8: 
You can

Outlining Text
Creating interesting text with unique fonts can be fun. But what if you need 
to send the text to someone who perhaps doesn’t have your funky Giddyup 
font? No problem — Fireworks lets you outline text, which means essentially 
turning it into a vector path.
 
The content of your text isn’t editable after it’s been outlined.
To outline your text, follow these steps:

Outlining Text
826
 
1. Create your text with the desired attributes, including font.
 
 The size doesn’t have to be exact, however; you can rescale even after 
outlining the text.
 
2. With the Pointer tool, select the text area.
 
 Note: You can’t outline individual letters or words within a text area.
 
3. Choose Text➪Convert Text to Paths.
 
 The text is outlined.
To edit the new vector path, switch to the Subselection tool and click an 
individual letter, as shown in Figure 4-9.

Chapter 5: Getting Images In 
and Out of Fireworks
In This Chapter
✓ Importing images
✓ Editing your images
✓ Optimizing and exporting images
C
reating images for your Web site is most likely what you’ll use 
Fireworks for most often. In this chapter, you find out how to work 
with images from various sources, discover the importance of optimizing, 
and see how to export your images.
Getting Images into Fireworks
Besides making your own graphics and illustrations, you can use four main 
methods for getting images into Fireworks:
 
✦ Open: Fireworks isn’t too picky. As long as you open images (vector or 
raster) by choosing File➪Open, you can open pretty much anything in 
Fireworks.
 
 In some cases, depending on the file format and color mode, choosing 
this command opens the Photoshop File Open Options dialog box (see 
Figure 5-1). This dialog box forces you to make some decisions about 
how the image will be rasterized in Fireworks before proceeding any 
further.
 
✦ Import: By choosing File➪Import, you can place an image directly in 
an existing image. The imported image is placed as a sublayer in the 
selected layer.
 
✦ Drag and drop: You can drag and drop an image from other applica-
tions, such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, right into the 
Fireworks workspace.

Editing Images
828
 
Figure 5-1: 
Some

decisions 
before 
opening 
them in 
Fireworks.
 
 
 To drag and drop between Adobe applications on the Windows plat-
form, you must drag your selection down to the application’s tab in the 
taskbar and wait for the application to come forward. Then you can drag 
into the work area.
 
✦ Browse: Just as you can in the rest of the Creative Suite applications, 
you can take advantage of Adobe Bridge to preview, search, and orga-
nize your images before opening them in Fireworks. Because images 
typically open in Photoshop by default, you need to right-click the image 
and choose Open with Adobe Fireworks CS4 from the contextual menu.
Editing Images
After you have an image, you can start editing it. The editing features in 
Fireworks are similar to those in Photoshop but not quite as extensive. 
You can do many of the basic tasks in Fireworks — cropping, painting, and 
even curve adjustments — but we suggest that you perform most in-depth 
retouching in Photoshop.
This section introduces five basic image-editing tasks that you typically per-
form when creating Web graphics. We also discuss the Image Editing panel, 
which lets you choose among multiple editing tools.
Scaling
Making images the right size is important. If an image is too large, you waste 
valuable download time; if it’s too small, the image will look pixelized and 
out of focus. We cover three scaling methods in the following sections.

Editing Images
829
Book VIII
Chapter 5
Getting Images 
In and Out of 
Fireworks
Proportional scaling
To scale an image in Fireworks proportionally (keeping the same width and 
height ratio), follow these steps:
 
1. Select the layer(s) that you want to scale.
 
 If you have multiple layers, you can hold down the Ctrl (Windows) or 
Ô (Mac) key and click the layers in the Layers panel to add them to the 
selection.
 
2. Select the Scale tool in the Select section of the Tools panel.
 
 Anchor points surround your selection.
 
3. To make an image smaller, Shift-click a corner anchor point and drag 
in toward the center; to make an image larger, Shift-click a corner 
anchor point and drag outward.
 
Typically, you don’t want to scale an image up, as it may become pixelized.
Nonproportional scaling
If you don’t want to scale proportionally, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the layer(s) that you want to scale.
 
2. Select the Scale tool in the Select section of the Tools panel.
 
3. To resize an image, click and drag a corner anchor point without 
using the Shift key.
Numeric scaling
If you need to constrain scaling to an exact amount, you are better off using 
the Image Editing panel. Follow these steps to perform numeric scaling:
 
1. Select the layer(s) that you want to scale.
 
2. Choose Window➪Others➪Image Editing.
 
 The Image Editing panel appears.
 
3. Click Transform Commands and choose Numeric Transform from the 
drop-down list, as shown in Figure 5-2.
 
4. In the Width and Height text boxes, type the percentage by which you 
want to scale and click OK.

Cropping
If you don’t need part of an image, get rid of it. Unwanted image data is a 
bad thing for Web graphics as it takes up valuable time when downloading. 
Follow these steps to eliminate unwanted image areas:
 
1. Select the Crop tool from the Select area of the Tools panel or from 
the Image Editing panel.
 
 Refer to the “Numeric scaling” section, earlier in this chapter, to see how 
to open the Image Editing panel.
 
2. Click and drag to select the area that you want to keep when the crop 
is complete.
 
3. Press the Enter/Return key.
 
 The image is cropped to the selected area, and the Crop tool is deselected.
If you’re working with a wireframe of a larger Web page design you may want 
to export only a small portion. For example, perhaps you want to export 
just the navigational tools, but not the rest of the page. To crop only when 
exporting, follow these steps:
 
1. Click and hold the Crop tool to select the Export Area tool.
 
2. Click and drag to select the area that you want to keep when the 
image is exported.
 
3. Double-click in the middle of the cropped area.
 
 The Image Preview window appears, offering you the opportunity to set 
export settings for this section of your image.

4. Choose your export settings.
 
 You can choose preset GIF and JPEG settings from the Saved Settings 
drop-down list in the upper right of the Image Preview dialog box, or use 
the Options, File, and Animation tabs on the left to set up custom export 
options.
 
5. Click Export.
 
 The selected area is exported to a location that you choose, and you are 
returned to your image, which is still intact.
Painting
Fireworks has many of the same painting capabilities as Photoshop, but the 
method in which you use them can be very different at times.
When you select the Brush tool from the Bitmap section of the Tools panel, 
for example, you make decisions about the size of the brush, paint color, 
and blending mode in the Properties panel (see Figure 5-3) rather than the 
Options panel, as in Photoshop.

Cloning
The Rubber Stamp tool works much like the Clone Stamp tool in Photoshop. 
Follow these steps to clone (copy) pixels in Fireworks:
 
1. Select the Rubber Stamp tool in the Bitmap section of the Tools panel.
 
2. Hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key, and click the part 
of the image you want to clone.
 
 On the left side of Figure 5-4, the head is selected as the source for cloning.

3. Position the mouse pointer over the area where you want the cloned 
pixels to appear, and start painting.
 
 The cloned pixels appear in the image area (see the right side of Figure 5-4).
As you paint, follow the marker for the source; it moves simultaneously 
with the mouse pointer. You can use the Properties panel to change brush 
attributes.
Filtering
Filters offer you many opportunities to edit your images. You can choose to 
blur your image or adjust the colors by using the Curves or Hue Adjustment 
layer. To access your filters, you can choose them from the Filters menu, or 
choose Window➪Others➪Image Editing.
If you want to apply additional filters that you can change later or even 
delete, click the Add Filters button in the Properties panel and choose 
Photoshop Live Effects from the drop-down list. The Photoshop Live Effects 
dialog box appears (see Figure 5-5).

In the following example, you use the Hue/Saturation filter to add a color tint 
to an image. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image and select it with the Pointer tool.
 
2. Click the Add Filter button in the Properties panel.
 
3. Choose Adjust Color and then Hue/Saturation.
 
 The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears (see Figure 5-6).

5. Adjust the Hue slider until you find a color that you want and click OK.
 
 The Add Filter button in the Properties panel now reads Edit Filter.
 
6. Click the Edit Filter button at any time to open the Filters panel and 
double-click the Hue/Saturation filter.
 
 The Hue/Saturation Filter panel opens, where you can make changes to 
the filter.
 
7. Delete a filter by selecting it from the filter list and clicking the minus 
icon (–) located in the top-left section of the Filter panel.
Red eye be gone!
Red eye is a typical result of using a camera 
with a built-in flash, but you can fix this problem 
easily. Click and hold the Rubber Stamp tool 
to select the Red Eye tool; then simply click 
and drag a marquee around each red-eye 
occurrence.

Optimizing Images for the Web
834
Optimizing Images for the Web
Now that you have created and edited your image, you’re ready to prepare 
it for the Web. You must consider two major factors in Web graphics: speed 
of download and appearance. Having the best of both worlds is difficult, 
however; usually, you opt to give up some appearance for better speed. This 
process is optimization.
Previewing Web settings
Fireworks helps you with the optimization process right from the beginning. 
By using the 2-Up preview in the top-left section of the image window, you 
can easily compare your optimized image with the original, based on your 
settings in the Optimize panel.
You can even use the preview windows to compare two to four Web formats 
and see which one looks best but has the most reasonable file size. Each pre-
view window includes important information such as file size.
If you want to go really crazy, you can compare four settings by clicking 4-Up 
(see Figure 5-7). With the preview windows, you can quickly change vari-
ous settings — such as format, number of colors, and quality — and see the 
effect immediately, without previewing the image on the Web.

Working with the Optimize panel
Now that you know how to compare images, where do you make the necessary 
optimization changes? In the Optimize panel, of course (see Figure 5-8). For a 
thorough description of each file format, including its benefits and drawbacks, 
see Book IV, Chapter 10, which covers Web optimization in Photoshop CS4.
 
Figure 5-8: 
Use the 
Optimize 
panel to find 
the best 
quality at 
the smallest 
file size.
 
When you understand the Web-format settings, you can click the preview 
image that you want to optimize; choose Window➪Optimize to open the 
Optimize panel; and apply settings that provide the best, most size-efficient 
image. Then you can export the image, as the following section explains.
Exporting for the Web
You can export individual images or entire Web pages by using the Export 
feature of Fireworks. The Export dialog box offers many of the same options 
as the Save for Web & Devices dialog box, which is described in depth in 
Book IV, Chapter 10.
To export a Fireworks document, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-9.
 
2. Navigate to an appropriate location to save your file.
 
 If you intend to use this image on a Web site, the best practice is to save 
it in the folder that you typically use for Web images.

In Chapter 6 in this minibook, you discover how to export entire pages with 
sliced images.

Chapter 6: Hotspots, Slices, 
and CSS Layouts
In This Chapter
✓ Getting familiar with Fireworks layers
✓ Hyperlinking with hotspots and image maps
✓ Creating slices
✓ Exporting images and HTML as tables or CSS
A
 simple method for organizing content and making a Web site dynamic 
is the faithful hyperlink. You can link to another location from a 
button, text, or even a move of the mouse pointer. By using layers in 
Fireworks, you can make those links dynamic and visually interesting.
In this chapter, you find out how Fireworks uses layers and then create navi-
gational links by using the slice feature.
Understanding Layers
Even though you may be an Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator user, the Layers 
panel in Fireworks may be somewhat of a mystery, as it works a little differ-
ently than you might expect. (Read on to find out how to take advantage of 
Fireworks layers.) To see the Layers panel, choose Window➪Layers.
Navigating the Layers panel
Figure 6-1 shows the two main components of the Layers panel:
 
✦ The Web Layer, which serves as a repository for anything code related, 
such as links and slices
 
✦ The default Layer 1, which includes sublayers that are created auto-
matically for every object you add to the Fireworks canvas

Working with the Layers panel
Here are just some of the things you can do in the Layers panel to organize 
your artwork better:
 
✦ Hide and show layers: Click the Visibility (Eye) icon to hide or show a 
layer or sublayer.
 
✦ Send objects forward and backward: Drag individual layers and sublay-
ers to arrange objects on those layers in front of or behind each other.
 
✦ Rename layers: By double-clicking the layer or sublayer name, you can 
rename the layer, which can be a huge help later when you’re trying to 
find a specific object.
 
✦ Organize layers: Create appropriately named layers to house related 
sublayers, thereby gaining the ability to move, copy, or delete multiple 
layers at the same time.
 
✦ Keep Web components separate: Use the Web Layer to keep track of 
hotspots and slices, as well as control the visibility of those items.
Creating Hotspots
Fireworks gives you lots of ways to take advantage of hyperlinks. In this sec-
tion, you see how to create a hotspot — essentially, a simple link from text or 
a graphic to a URL (Universal Resource Locator) on the Web. In Chapter 7 of 
this minibook, you find out how to create buttons that interact with the user.
Figure 6-1:

panel in 
Fireworks.

Creating Hotspots
839
Book VIII
Chapter 6
Hotspots, Slices, 
and CSS Layouts
Defining a hotspot
To link text or a graphic to a Web URL, you must first define it as a hotspot. 
You can define a hotspot by using either of two methods:
 
✦ Select the Hotspot tool in the Web section of the Tools panel, and click 
and drag over the part of the image that you want to create as the linked 
part of the image.
 
✦ Select the item (text or graphics) and then right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac) the selected item, and choose Insert Hotspot from 
the contextual menu.
Linking a hotspot
After you define a hotspot, you can define the location (typically, a Web 
page) that you want the hotspot to link to. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪URL.
 
 The URL panel appears (see Figure 6-2).
 
2. Type a URL address that you wish the viewer to go to after selecting 
this region.
 
 In Figure 6-2, a link to an external Web site (http://www.adobe.com) 
is referenced.
 
 When you reference pages beyond your Web site (external links), you 
must start the link with http://.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Assign a link 
to a hotspot.
 
 
3. Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers panel, if it isn’t already 
open.
 
 The hotspot you created appears as a separate sublayer of the Web 
Layer.
 
4. Double-click the name of this sublayer and give it a more appropriate 
name, as shown in Figure 6-3.
In the next section, you discover options for working with multiple hotspots.

Working with Image Maps

Working with Image Maps
When you create a graphic and add multiple hotspots to it, the graphic 
becomes an image map. In Figure 6-4, the image map was created from a 
polygon.
 
Figure 6-4: 
An image 
map allows 
you to

Creating an image map
To create an image map of your own, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a graphic file that you want to assign multiple hotspots to.
 
2. Click and hold the Rectangle Hot Spot tool in the Web section of 
the Tools panel and choose one of the three hidden hotspot tools: 
Rectangle, Circle, or Polygon.
 
3. If you choose the Rectangle or Circle tool in Step 2, simply click and 
drag to define the hotspot.
 
 Alternatively, to create a region with the Polygon tool, simply click and 
release from point to point to create a custom region.

Book VIII
Chapter 6
Hotspots, Slices, 
and CSS Layouts
 
If you didn’t get the shapes just right, don’t fret. You can use the Pointer and 
Subselection tools to move and resize images.
Linking an image map
After you create an image map, you can define hotspots on it and link those 
hotspots to URLs. For directions on both procedures, refer to the “Creating 
Hotspots” section, earlier in this chapter.
Here are some types of links other than URLs that you can use:
 
✦ E-mail address: Type mailto:youremail address in the URL text box to 
create a link that opens a message window, with your address already 
entered and ready to go!
 
✦ Non-HTML files on the server: You can type 2008/catalog.pdf, for exam-
ple, to instruct the browser to open a PDF file named catalog that is 
inside the 2008 folder.
Repeat the process of defining hotspots and assigning URLs as many times 
as you like.
Testing and exporting an image map
After you’ve created and linked your image map, you’re ready to test and 
export it for use on your Web page. Follow these steps:
 
1. Test your image map by choosing File➪Preview in Browser.
 
2. If you’re happy with the results, close the browser window and return

3. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box appears.
 
4. Type a name in the Name text box.
 
5. Choose HTML and Images from the Export drop-down list.
 
6. Choose Export HTML File from the HTML drop-down list.
 
7. Choose None from the Slices drop-down list and click Save.
That’s it! Now you can choose File➪Open in your browser and locate the HTML 
file to test your actual finished project, or choose File➪Open in a Web-editing 
program (such as Adobe Dreamweaver) to modify the HTML file.
In Figure 6-5, you see the completed file in a Web browser, along with the 
associated code that was created in Fireworks.

Slicing Up Your Art
Slicing is a technique for breaking large files into smaller packets so that 
they download faster on the Web. It’s also a method for attaching URLs to 
different regions of an image, like image maps. Unlike image maps, however, 
slices are created in a grid pattern.
You can even use slices to optimize different parts of an image with separate 
settings. Perhaps you can get away with having one section of an image be of 
lower quality than another section.
A perfect candidate for sliced artwork is a navigation bar, such as the one 
you see in Figure 6-6. Each tab is an individual slice that, when clicked in a 
Web browser, takes the viewer to a different location.

Creating the basic image
First, you create the basic image — a rectangle, for this example. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New to open the New Document dialog box.
 
2. Type 500 in the Width text box and 200 in the Height text box; then 
click OK.
 
 The new blank document opens. (Notice that the document is larger 
than the image you’re creating; you see how to modify it later in these 
steps.)
 
3. Select the Rectangle tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel, and 
click and drag to create a rectangle.
 
 For this exercise, any size is fine.
 
4. With the rectangle selected, click Fill Color in the Colors section of the 
Tools panel, and choose a color.
 
 For this exercise, we chose a light color (yellow).
 
5. Choose Window➪Info to open the Info panel.
 
6. Enter 300 in the W (Width) text box and 50 in the H (Height) text box.
 
 The rectangle is resized.
 
7. With the Pointer tool, click anywhere in the canvas outside the rect-
angle to deselect the rectangle.
 
8. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac), and choose Modify 
Canvas➪Fit Canvas from the contextual menu (see Figure 6-7).
 
 The canvas adjusts to the size of the rectangle (see Figure 6-8).
 
Figure 6-7: 
Choose the 
Fit Canvas 
command.

Adding text
Now you add some text areas to the navbar. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Text tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel.
 
2. Click Fill Color in the Colors section of the Tools panel, and choose a 
color.
 
 For this exercise, we chose a dark color (black).
 
3. Set the font and font size in the Properties panel.
 
 For this exercise, we changed the font to Myriad Pro, and used the Font 
Size slider to change the size to 25.
 
4. Click the left half of the rectangle to position the insertion point 
where you want the text to begin, and type the text.
 
 For this exercise, we typed Home, as shown in Figure 6-9.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Adding 
text to the

5. Click twice to the right of the text area to deselect the active text area 
and create a new one.
 
6. Type a word or two for your next navigation tab.
 
 For example, we typed About.
 
7. Use the Pointer tool to reposition the text.

Doing the actual slicing and dicing
Now that you’ve prepared your simple but efficient navbar, use the Slice tool 
to create a couple of slices and then export them. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Slice tool in the Web section of the Tools panel; then click 
and drag from the top-left corner of the Home section of the rectangle 
toward the bottom-right corner, as shown in Figure 6-10.
 
 Your drag doesn’t have to be exact.
 
 If you’re going for perfection, choose View➪Rulers to display the rulers. 
When the rulers are visible, you can click and drag guides out of them.
 
Figure 6-10: 
Creating a 
slice.
 
 
 When you have an active slice, the Properties panel changes to offer you 
various slice options.
 
2. Change the format by making a choice from the Slice Export Settings 
drop-down list.
 
 Choose the GIF format if the artwork has lots of solid color, or choose 
JPEG for images with lots of gradation of color.
 
3. Enter a link in the Link text box.
 
4. Enter a brief description of the link in the Alt text box.
 
 Alt text is the text that appears while a page is downloading. It also 
appears in place of the graphic if a viewer has turned graphics display 
off in his Web browser.
 
5. To test the link feature, type http://www.agitraining.com.
 
6. Type Training in the Alt text box, as shown in Figure 6-11.
 
Figure 6-11: 
Enter the 
URL and Alt

846
 
7. With the Slice tool, click and drag to surround the second half of the 
navbar.
 
8. Type http://www.adobe.com into the Link text box and type Adobe, 
Inc. into the Alt text box.
That is slicing in simple form. You can make the process as complicated as 
you want by creating entire sliced pages (because search engines like to 
search for text content) to navbars with many links and destinations.
In the next section, you find out how to get your navbar out of Fireworks and 
on a Web page.
Exporting Slices
You can export finished slices for use on a Web page.
Exporting slices as tables
To export sliced artwork as tables (for these steps, your test navbar), follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box appears.
 
2. Browse to the folder where you store your Web files and make sure 
that you pick a file connected with the Web site that you’re creating 
your images for.
 
3. In the File Name text box, enter a name.
 
 For this exercise, we typed navbar.htm.
 
4. Choose Export HTML and Images from the Export drop-down list.
 
5. Choose Export Slices from the Slices drop-down list and click Save.
Now that you’ve exported the HTML code and the image, you can open the 
image in a Web-editing program like Dreamweaver and add elements or 
simply copy and paste it into an existing page or template. Find out more 
about Dreamweaver in Book VI.

If you want more control of your slices, you can change the code that 
Fireworks creates upon output.

Chapter 7: Using Buttons 
and Symbols
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding states
✓ Creating rollover buttons
✓ Converting graphics to symbols
B
efore you jump into creating buttons and animations, you need to 
understand states and how they work in Fireworks. States let you 
organize layers in such a way that you can create several versions of your 
artwork; these states could be used for rollovers or animations.
Using States in Fireworks
You may want to use states for two reasons:
 
✦ States for animation: You can build and edit animated GIFs with states 
like the one you see in Figure 7-1. One step of the animation goes into 
each frame. The states (sometimes referred to as frames) are played 
one after another to create the appearance of motion — an effect a little 
like those cool flip books you may have found in caramel-corn boxes. By 
using layers, you can specify which items are animated and which items 
remain static.
 
Figure 7-1: 
In this 
example, 
the woman 
moves 
from left to 
right in five 
separate 
states.
 

Making a Rollover Button
850
 
✦ States for rollovers: You can also use states to produce rollovers. By 
slicing an image (discussed in Chapter 6 of this minibook), you can trig-
ger the different versions (or states) that appear when the user’s mouse 
pointer crosses over the artwork.
Making a Rollover Button
You can create interactive buttons in Fireworks to make rollovers, swap 
images, and react to other interactions with viewers. For all these effects, 
use the States panel.
In this section, you find out how to use states to create a rollover button — 
a button that changes when a mouse pointer passes over it.
Creating the basic art
First, you need to create the basic art for the button. (For this exercise, the 
button is a rounded rectangle, but you can substitute another shape.) Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click and hold the Rectangle tool in the Vector section of the Tools 
panel and then select Rounded Rectangle from the list of hidden tools.
 
2. Click and drag in the workspace to create a shape.
 
 Any size is fine for this exercise.
 
3. Choose Window➪Styles to open the Styles panel.
 
4. Choose a style from the drop-down list (see Figure 7-2).
 
 This basic button is what the viewer will initially see on your Web page.
 
Figure 7-2: 
Using the 
Styles 
panel, apply 
any style to 
the shape.

Adding rollover behavior
In this section, you add rollover behavior to the button and create the ver-
sion of the button artwork that the viewers will see when their mouse point-
ers pass over it. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Slice tool from the Web section of the Tools panel and then 
click and drag around the shape you created in the preceding section 
to create a slice.
 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the center of the slice 
and choose Add Simple Rollover Behavior from the contextual menu 
(see Figure 7-3).
 
Figure 7-3: 
Choose 
Add Simple

3. Choose Window➪States to open the States panel.
 
4. From the States panel menu, choose Duplicate State.
 
 The Duplicate State dialog box appears. Keep the settings at the default 
of state 1 being inserted after the current state.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 A state 2 row appears in the States panel.
 
6. Click the Hide Slices and Hotspots tool in the Web section of the Tools 
panel to hide your slice.
 
7. With the Pointer tool, select the original shape that you created.
 
8. Choose Window➪Styles to open the Styles panel.
 
9. Choose a new style from the drop-down list.
 
 This step creates the version of the button that will appear when view-
ers pass their mouse pointers over the button.
 
10. Save the file.

852
Testing and exporting the button
Now you’re ready to test and export your new rollover button. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Preview in Browser to test your button.
 
2. If you’re happy with the effect and want to use the button on a Web 
page, choose File➪Export to open the Export dialog box.
 
3. Name the file.
 
 Remember that you need to follow standard Web-based naming 
conventions.
 
4. Choose HTML and Images from the Export drop-down list.
 
5. Make sure that Export HTML File is selected in the HTML drop-down 
list and that Export Slices is selected in the Slices drop-down list and 
then click Export.
Discovering Fireworks Symbols
When you make Web graphics, you may discover that you create the same 
button or the same background image over and over. To stay consistent and 
save lots of time, you can turn artwork into a symbol or use some of the pre-
created symbols in the Common Library panel.
Symbols are simply elements that you can store in the Common Library or 
Document Library panel. Use the Common Library to store symbols that 
you can access across Fireworks; the Document Library is for symbols to be 
accessed only within the associated document.
Fireworks has three types of symbols: graphic, animation, and button. In this 
section, you find out how to use and modify symbols.
Symbol instances are the actual placement of the symbols on the artboard. 
Symbol instances are dynamically linked back to the original symbol used to 
create it.
 
If you convert artwork to a symbol, the new symbol object is linked dynami-
cally to all the instances of that symbol on the artboard. If you change the 
symbol object, all instances are updated automatically.

Working with a precreated symbol
To use a precreated symbol in Fireworks, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Common Library to open the Common Library 
panel.
 
 The precreated symbols in this library are organized in categories, such 
as Animations, Buttons, and Flex Components.
 
2. Double-click the category you want to use.
 
3. Select a symbol to see a preview in the preview pane at the top of the 
Common Library panel.
 
4. When you find a symbol that you want to use, drag it out to the 
artboard.
 
 The symbol instance is placed on the artboard (see Figure 7-4).
 
Figure 7-4: 
Creating 
a symbol 
instance.
 
If you’re creating a navigation bar with four buttons, for example, repeat 
Step 4 three more times.
Converting artwork to a symbol
If you find yourself in the position of repeatedly creating the same button, 
animation, or graphic, follow these steps to convert that artwork to a 
symbol:

Discovering Fireworks Symbols
854
 
1. With the Pointer tool, select the artwork that you want to convert.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Symbol➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 The Convert to Symbol dialog box opens.
 
3. Type a name for the symbol in the Name text box.
 
4. Select the symbol type: Graphic, Animation, or Button.
 
5. To scale the symbol without distorting it, check the Enable 9-Slice 
Scaling Guides check box (see Figure 7-5).
 
Figure 7-5: 
Setting 
symbol 
options.
 
 
6. To store the symbol so that it can be used in multiple documents, 
check the Save to Common Library check box.
 
7. Click OK to save the symbol.
 
 The saved symbol can now be found by selecting Window➪Common 
Library. Double-click the Custom Symbols folder to locate any symbols 
created and saved to the Common Library.
 
Adobe Illustrator has many symbols you can borrow from its symbol librar-
ies. Simply drag a symbol from the Illustrator Symbols panel onto the art-
board and then copy and paste it into Fireworks. All components, such as 
vector shapes, are maintained. Find out more about Illustrator symbols in 
Book III, Chapter 11.
Scaling with 9-slice
A helpful feature of Fireworks is 9-slice scaling, 
which lets you determine what part of a symbol 
will be scaled. This feature can be extremely 
helpful when you are working with buttons that 
have rounded corners or other elements that 
you don’t want to scale. To use this feature, 
simply check the Enable 9-Slice Scaling Guides 
check box in the Convert to Symbol dialog box.

Using Buttons 
and Symbols
Editing a symbol
You can edit a symbol object or just one instance of it. You might want to 
edit the symbol object if you decide to change the color of all your buttons 
to orange at the same time, but you’d edit each symbol instance individually 
if you want each button to have a different word on it.
To edit a symbol object or instance, double-click it. Then use your tools to 
reposition, recolor, retype, and make any other modifications that you’d 
make to any other graphic in Fireworks.
If you no longer want an object to be a symbol, choose Modify➪Symbol➪
Break Apart.
Editing a symbol without breaking the link
At times, you may want to change an instance but maintain its link to the 
symbol object. Perhaps you are creating a cool graphic effect of butterflies and 
want to change one butterfly’s position and opacity, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Edit 
properties 
of symbol 
instances 
without

You can use the Properties panel to modify the following instance properties 
without affecting the symbol object or other symbol instances:
 
✦ Blending mode
 
✦ Opacity
 
✦ Filters
 
✦ Width and height
 
✦ X and y coordinates

Editing a symbol component
At times, you need to break a symbol apart so that you can edit its compo-
nents, perhaps to change their colors. To edit individual components of a 
symbol, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the symbol instance that you want to modify.
 
2.  Choose Modify➪Symbol➪Break Apart.
 
 The symbol instance is no longer linked to the symbol object.
 
3. With the Subselection tool, select the components of the artwork that 
you want to edit.
 
 They’re now ready for you to make any changes that you would make to 
regular (non-symbol) objects on your artboard.
 
 When you modify the original symbol object, this instance is longer be 
affected.

A
nimations, used in moderation, can liven up a page. You can make 
simple animations to create effects of light and movement — or go to 
the max with dancing babies. The subtle approach probably is better, as 
most folks are more intrigued by interesting content than by distracting ani-
mations. Still, you find animations being used every day, especially in rotat-
ing banner ads.
The animations that you produce in Fireworks aren’t quite the same those 
in Flash. Fireworks animations typically are smaller and are saved in the GIF 
format, which doesn’t require a plug-in to view. You create them by using 
the States panel, which we cover in detail in Chapter 7 of this book.
In this chapter, you use the States panel to create multiple versions of your 
artwork that play one after another to create an animation 
 
The terms states and frames can be used interchangeably (though we gener-
ally prefer the term states).
 
As you create images for animation, experiment to find out how many 
colors you can include without increasing the file size dramatically. If you’re 
working with size restrictions (as many advertising sites require), you may 
have to make the image files smaller by deleting states or adjusting color. 
Creating animations is a give-and-take process, in which you’re trying to get 
the best effects from the smallest files.

Getting Started with Animation
858
Getting Started with Animation
Creating images is a simple process in Fireworks. Creating images for anima-
tions is also simple but slightly different, in that the images are created from 
several states that play one after another to create the illusion of movement. 
In the first two sections of this chapter, you create a simple manual anima-
tion of a bouncing ball. Later in the chapter, you find out how to automate 
the process.
Creating an animation
To create an image for animation, follow these steps:
 
1. Create or open the object that you want to animate.
 
 For this example, create a circle with the Ellipse tool.
 
2. With the Pointer tool, select the circle.
 
3. Choose Window➪States.
 
 The States panel appears, listing one state (see Figure 8-1).

5. Use the Number slider to add three new states.
 
6. In the Insert New States section, select the After Current State radio 
button and then click OK.
 
 Because all the states are identical, you see no change. The objects are 
positioned on top of one another.
Onion skinning
Onion skinning can be a huge help when you’re trying to create a good 
flow for an animation. Onion skinning gives you the opportunity to edit the 
selected state but view (in a dimmed view) the states that come before and 
after the selected state, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Keep track 
of the states 
with onion 
skinning.
 

Getting Started with Animation
860
To use onion skinning in your animation, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the State 2 row in the States panel.
 
2. Click the Onion Skinning button in the bottom-left corner of the panel 
(refer to Figure 8-1).
 
 A drop-down list appears.
 
3. Select Show All States to show one state before and one after the 
selected state.
Making the animation move
Creating the actual animation certainly isn’t rocket science, but you need to 
pay attention to the state you select before making your move.
To put your animation in motion, follow these steps:
 
1. Select State 2 in the States panel to view the state 2 circle.
 
2. With the Pointer tool, drag the circle slightly up and to the right.
Adding an object to multiple states
Perhaps you created the perfect animation but 
then discovered that you forgot to include an 
element. You can copy or create the missing 
object in one state and then add it to all the 
other states. Follow these steps:
 1. Select the state in which you want the new 
object to appear.
 2. Copy and paste the artwork for the new 
object to the selected state, or create the 
new object in that state.
 3. Make sure that the new artwork is 
selected, right-click (Windows) or Control-
click (Mac) the selected state in the States 
panel, and choose Copy to States from the 
contextual menu.
 
 The Copy to States dialog box appears.
 4. Select the All States radio button (see the 
following figure), and click OK.
 
 The selected object is included in all the 
states.

5. Select State 4 to view the state 4 circle.
 
6. Drag the circle above and to the right of the state 3 circle.
 
 You should see a flow that — in a very primitive way — represents a 
bouncing ball (see Figure 8-4).
 
Figure 8-4:

Testing the animation
You can test an animation right in the Fireworks artboard or on the Web.
Testing in Fireworks
Fireworks provides several playback controls on the right side of the art-
board window, as shown in Figure 8-5.
  
First State
Play/Stop
Last State
Current State

Adjusting Playback
862
To use these controls to test an animation in Fireworks, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Play button to start the animation.
 
 Notice that the Play button changes to the Stop button.
 
2. After playing the animation, click the Stop button to stop the animation.
In the “Adjusting Playback” section, later in this chapter, you find out how to 
control the speed of each state (or frame) and discover where to turn looping 
(repeat) off and on.
Testing on the Web
The Preview in Browser feature gives you a more accurate idea of how your 
animation will appear to the viewer. This procedure is so easy that no steps 
are necessary: Choose File➪Preview in Browser and select the browser in 
which you want to preview the animation.
Adjusting Playback
You can speed or slow an entire animation, or control the speed of each 
slide individually. Controlling the timing of individual states can be helpful 
in an advertising animation, for example, if you want to keep one state vis-
ible longer than the others. You can also loop an animation. This section 
describes both types of changes.
Changing the frame rate
The frame rate is the speed at which your animation will play. To change the 
frame rate, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the states(s) for which you want to set the frame rate.
 
2. Choose Properties from the panel menu in the top-right corner of the 
States panel.
 
 The State Delay pop-up appears, as shown in Figure 8-6.

3. In the text box, enter a value (in 100ths of a second) to make the ani-
mation go faster or slower.
 
 The lower the value you enter, the faster the animation plays. Make sure 
the Include when Exporting check box is selected. Click anywhere on the 
artboard to close the window.
 
4. (Optional) To test the results of you frame rate change, press the Play 
button in the lower-right side of the artboard window.
 
Want to display one state longer than the others? Select only that particu-
lar state and then change its frame rate to be slower than the other states’ 
frame rates.
Playing it again: Looping
You can choose to loop an animation into eternity or just a certain number 
of times. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the GIF Animation Looping button in the bottom-left corner of 
the States panel (refer to Figure 8-1).
 
 A menu drops down.
 
2. Choose the number of times you want the animation to loop (see 
Figure 8-7).
 
Figure 8-7: 
Set the 
loop for the 
animation in 
the States 
panel.
 
 
3. Save and close the animation.
You’ve completed a manual animation. In the next section, you find out 
how to create an animation in which Fireworks creates the states for you 
automatically.

Tweening in Fireworks
864
Tweening in Fireworks
Tweening is the process of creating a state between two others, usually as 
a start or stop point for the animation. Use tweening to simulate an object 
moving, like a ball bouncing, or fading an image in or out of an animation.
Creating a symbol
To use the tweening feature in Fireworks, you must have a symbol — for this 
example, an arrow. To create this symbol, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New and create a new document large enough to contain 
your animation.
 
 For this exercise, create a document 500 pixels by 500 pixels.
 
2. Click and hold the Rectangle tool, and select the Arrow tool from the 
Vector section of the Tools panel.
 
3. In the top-left corner of the canvas, click and drag to create a small 
arrow.
 
4. Choose Modify➪Symbol➪Convert to Symbol.
 
 The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears.
 
5. Type an appropriate name for the symbol in the Name text box (such 
as Arrow), select the Graphic radio button, and click OK.
 
 Fireworks converts your arrow graphic to a symbol.
Cloning the symbol
After you create a symbol, you need to clone the symbol to create start and 
end points for the animation. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the arrow symbol on the canvas.
 
2. Holding down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key, drag the arrow 
to the bottom-right corner of the canvas.
 
 As shown in Figure 8-8, by holding down the Alt/Option key while you 
drag, you’re cloning the arrow.
 
3. Choose the Scale tool in the Select section of the Tools panel, and 
make the cloned arrow (in the bottom-right corner) larger than the

4. With the Pointer tool, position both arrow symbols on the canvas the 
way you want them.
 
 These symbols are the start and end points for your animation, so place 
them where you want the animation to begin and end.

There — Animate!
 
Figure 8-8: 
Create a 
start and 
end point 
for the 
animation 
by cloning 
the symbol.
 
Tweening the symbols
When you have two instances of the symbol on the artboard, you’re ready to 
tween the symbols to create an animation. Follow these steps:
 
1. With the Pointer tool, select one of the arrow symbols and then Shift-
click the other to select both at the same time.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Symbol➪Tween Instances.
 
 The Tween Instances dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a value in the Steps text box.
 
 For this example, enter 5 (see Figure 8-9) to create 5 new states (or 
frames) for transforming the small arrow into the large arrow.
 
4. (Optional) If you want the symbols to appear one at a time, you want 
those states to be distributed to separate states in the States panel, so 
check the Distribute to States check box.
 
5. Click OK.
 
6. Test your animation by clicking the Play button in the bottom-right 
section of the Fireworks workspace and then save the file.
 
Figure 8-9: 
Set the 
number of 
states.
 

Animating with Masks
866
Animating with Masks
If you’re a Photoshop user, you’re probably familiar with masks. Masks let 
you choose the viewable area of an image. The process is much like cutting 
a hole in a piece of paper and then placing an image under it. The hole in the 
paper shows only the area of the image below that you want to expose; the 
rest of the paper masks (covers) the parts of the image that you don’t want 
to expose.
You can take this masking feature a step further in Fireworks by animating a 
mask. In this section, you create a simple object and mask, and then animate 
the mask.
Creating an image and mask
To create the image and mask for your animation, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new document that’s 500 pixels by 500 pixels in size.
 
2. With the Star tool (hidden in the Rectangle tool), create lots of stars 
close together.
 
 Use any colors and sizes you want for the stars. This step creates mul-
tiple layers.
 
3. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
 
4. Click the top layer listed in the Layers panel and then Shift-click the 
bottom layer to select all the layers that you created.
 
5. From the panel menu in the Layers panel, choose Flatten Selection.
 
 The layers are flattened into one bitmap layer.
 
6. Select the Marquee tool in the Bitmap section of the Tools panel, make 
a narrow rectangular selection through the middle of the stars, and 
then click the Add Mask button at the bottom of the Layers panel (see 
Figure 8-10).
 
 Fireworks creates a mask based on the image area you selected.
Animating the mask
In this section, you animate the mask but not the stars. Follow these steps:
 
1. In the Layers panel, click the chain that appears between the stars 
layer and the mask.
 
 This chain lets you move the layer and mask independently.
 
2. In the Layers panel, click the mask to select it.

3. From the panel menu in the States panel, choose Duplicate State.
 
 The Duplicate State dialog box appears.
 
4. Select the After Current State radio button, and click OK.
 
 State 2 appears.
 
5. With the Pointer tool, drag the mask down slightly on the canvas.
 
 The stars stay in place; only the mask moves.
 
6. Repeat Step 5 at least once.
 
7. Test your animation by clicking the Play button in the bottom-right 
section of the Fireworks workspace.
You can come up with some creative animations by using this technique, 
perhaps using a logo or other text as a mask.
 
Figure 8-10: 
Select an 
area for 
masking 
(top) and the 
mask based 
on the 
selection 
(bottom).
 
Exporting an Animation
You created it, you tested it, you previewed it, and now you want to use it. 
To make an animation work, all you have to do is choose the GIF format in 
the Optimize panel. (GIF is the Web format that supports animation.) No 
HTML is needed.

Exporting an Animation
868
To export an animation, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export dialog box appears.
 
2. Choose Images Only from the Export drop-down list.
 
3. Name the file.
 
4. Put the file in your site location by navigating to the correct folder 
and clicking Export.
