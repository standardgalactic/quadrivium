Financial Statements – Income Statement and Balance Shee
1	 Financial Statements – Income 
Statement and Balance Sheet
1.1	
Introduction
In all businesses, financial statements are important for reflecting the financial health of a company. The 
construction industry is without exception. Among various financial statements, two of them are the 
most important ones. They are (1) Income Statement (or called Profit & Loss Account) and (2) Balance 
Sheet. In this chapter, these two important financial statements will be discussed in detail. First, we will 
look at an income statement. Second, we will see the use of a balance sheet. Third, we will see other 
important items that are closely related to these two financial statements.
1.2	
Income Statement
An ‘income statement’ shows the profit made or the loss incurred by a company in a period of time 
(usually one year), and that is why it is sometimes also called a ‘profit and loss account’. In an income 
statement, usually two columns of figures are shown for comparison purpose, one column showing the 
figures of the most recent year and the other column showing that of the year before. An example of 
income statement is shown in Table 1.1 (see next page). It shows a company’s revenue, costs and other 
expenses including the interest payment on loan (if there is a loan borrowed by the company) and the 
income tax paid. The purpose of the income statement is to show whether or not a company’s business 
is profitable.
The first row of the income statement shown in Table 1.1 is Revenue (some people may use the terms 
such as Sales or Income). It represents the amount of money the company receives before (or without) 
deducting any expenditures related to the company’s revenue. The second row is Cost of Revenue. It 
is the direct construction/production cost etc. which the construction company has incurred in order 
to earn the Revenue. We obtain Gross Profit by deducting the Cost of Revenue from the Revenue. 
Operating Expenses usually consist of Variable Overhead (e.g. advertising, plant, equipment, vehicles, 
etc.) and Fixed Overhead (e.g. depreciation, rent, salaries, insurance, etc.), a more detailed example of 
which will be given in Table 2.1 of Chapter 2. After deducting the Operating Expenses from the Gross 
Profit, we obtain Operating Profit.
The Interest Expense shown under Other Income/Expense in Table 1.1 is the interest payment on loan 
if a loan is borrowed by the company. Since interest on loan is tax deductible so it must be deducted 
in order to obtain the Net Profit before Tax, which is calculated by deducting the Total Other Income/
Expense from the Operating Profit. The amount of income tax payable is then calculated based on the 
tax rate. By deducting this calculated Tax Expense from the Net Profit before Tax, we obtain Net Profit 
after Tax. This figure indicates whether or not the construction company’s business is profitable.

Balance Sheet
A balance sheet shows a company’s financial position as at a point of time (usually the last date of the 
company’s fiscal year), like a snap shot picture of the company’s financial situation at that particular time 
point. An example of balance sheet of a construction company is shown in Table 1.2 (see next page). 
There are three major items in a balance sheet: (1) Assets, (2) Liabilities, and (3) Equity (or called Net 
Worth). These will be explained in the following sub-sections.

Financial Statements – Income Statement and Balance Shee
1.3.1	
Assets
Assets are classified into two categories: (1) Current Assets and (2) Fixed Assets. They represent what a 
company owns, and are usually presented at the top (first part) of a balance sheet. Current Assets of a 
construction company are usually cash, accounts receivable, construction material inventory and so on 
which have high liquidity (i.e. can be turned into cash easily). Fixed Assets of a construction company 
are usually property and equipment, construction plant, trucks and so on which cannot be readily turned 
into cash in a short time. Fixed Assets are also called Long-term Assets. When Current Assets and Fixed 
Assets are added together, the sum is called Total Assets.
1.3.2	
Liabilities
When a construction company owes obligations to some third parties, we call these obligations Liabilities. 
Liabilities are usually presented at the middle part of a balance sheet. They are classified into (1) Current 
Liabilities and (2) Long-term Liabilities. Current Liabilities of a construction company include bank 
overdraft and short term bank loan, accounts payable to subcontractors, suppliers and employers, rents, 
utilities and so on. They are debts the company has to pay, say, within a year. Long-term Liabilities, 
however, are obligations with a period more than one year, usually a few years or even longer. They 
often refer to long term bank loans or loans for mortgages of equipment, building, land, or even cars/
trucks. These long-term debts are usually repaid by installments. When Current Liabilities and Long-
term Liabilities are added together, the sum is called Total Liabilities.
1.3.3	
Equity
Equity is the capital invested by the owner(s) of a company. Because some construction companies are 
owned by stockholders, so Equity is sometimes also referred to as Stockholders’ Equity. Another name 
for it is ‘Net Worth’. Equity represents the Net Worth of the business, and can be calculated by summing 
up the capital the owners have invested and the profits that have been accumulated (after deducting 
all the dividends paid so far to the owners) and retained up to the present moment since the business 
began (see Table 7.12 of Chapter 7).

Financial Statements – Income Statement and Balance Shee
The following is a very important mathematical relationship:
Equity + Total Liabilities = Total Assets
(Eq 1.1)
(Net Worth)
Equation 1.1 is also called “The Accounting Equation”. Readers can find that the last row of Table 1.2 
is equal to the Total Assets’ row at the middle of the balance sheet. The name, Balance Sheet, is in fact 
derived from this fact – they must be in balance.
1.4 	
Working Capital and Current Ratio
1.4.1	
Working Capital
The difference of Current Assets and Current Liabilities is called Working Capital. So, it can be 
mathematically presented as:
Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities
(Eq 1.2)
In our example (Table 1.2), the working capital is $2,207,462 (i.e. $10,676,728 – $8,469,266) as at 31 Dec 
2011, and is $3,838,665 (i.e. $12,289,500 – $8,450,835) as at 31 Dec 2012.
The amount of working capital in hand is a measure of the short term financial strength of a construction 
company. It is because the liquidity (see section 1.3.1) of working capital is high. Current assets are 
used to pay current liabilities, and therefore it is important to know how much current assets exceed 
current liabilities, which is told by the amount of working capital. Working capital increases when a 
company makes a profit on a project, sells equipment or other assets, or has a long term loan from a 
bank. A long term bank loan can increase current (short term) assets, but at the same time increases 
long term liabilities. However, construction companies usually do not easily resort to selling equipment 
or borrowing long term loans. Working capital decreases when a company loses money on a project, or 
when it purchases equipment, or makes repayments on long term loans. Construction companies are, 
however, eager to purchase equipment or to pay off loans.
Empirically, it has been found that the volume of unfinished work of all projects in hand should be at 
most about ten times the working capital for a construction company. If there is a big project among the 
projects in hand, the unfinished volume of work of this big project should not be more than five times 
the working capital. These are to ensure that the company may maintain a healthy financial condition.
1.4.2	
Current Ratio
Besides the working capital, we also use a ratio for identifying a construction company’s liquidity (or its 
ability to fulfill short term financial obligations). The ratio is called Current Ratio and is defined as follows:
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
(Eq 1.3)

Financial Statements – Income Statement and Balance Shee
In our example (Table 1.2), the current ratio is 1.26 (i.e. $10,676,728 / $8,469,266) as at 31 Dec 2011, 
and is 1.45 (i.e. $12,289,500 / $8,450,835) as at 31 Dec 2012.
The current ratio for a construction company should be 1.3 or higher. This is obtained by experience over 
a long period of time. In our example, the financial health of the company was a little unsatisfactory in 
2011, because the current ratio was 1.26, a little lower than 1.3. However, the financial situation became 
more healthy in 2012, because the current ratio increased to 1.45, higher than 1.3.
In financial management, there are many ratios other than the current ratio. We will look at them, 
particularly those related to construction, in Chapter 2.
1.5	
Under Billing and Over Billing
Under billing is expressed in the balance sheet as “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on 
work in progress” under Current Assets (see Table 1.2). Over billing is expressed as “Billings in excess of 
costs and estimated earnings on work in progress” under Current Liabilities. Let us look at an example 
of what they are and how they are evaluated.

Financial Statements – Income Statement and Balance Shee
A construction company has the following project financial data:
•	 Contract sum
$8,000,000
•	 Billed to date
$4,700,000
•	 Cost incurred (i.e. cost of revenue) to date
$3,700,000
•	 Estimated cost to complete
$3,000,000
Up to the present moment, the percentage of completion 
= [Cost incurred to date / (Cost incurred to date + Estimated cost to complete)] × 100%
= [$3,700,000 / ($3,700,000 + $3,000,000)] × 100%
= 55.22%
Revenue to date = (Contract sum) × (% of completion) 
= $8,000,000 × 55.22% = $4,417,600
Gross Profit to date = Revenue to date – Cost of Revenue to date
= $4,417,600 – $3,700,000 = $717,600
Over billing = Billed to date – Revenue to date
= $4,700,000 – $4,417,600 = $282,400
If over billing is a negative value, then it is called under billing. Hence,
Under billing = Revenue to date – Billed to date
Over billing means that the construction company is borrowing money from the client by billing the 
latter an amount of revenue more than what the company has actually done. This does not mean that 
the total (final) revenue is to be billed wrongly, but is just the case that more money is received at an 
earlier stage of the work. On the contrary, under billing means that the company is allowing the client 
to borrow money from it, because it has incurred cost for doing work but without appropriately billed 
for the work.
There is an interesting point to note in the above example. The difference of the ‘billed to date’ and ‘cost 
incurred to date’ is $1,000,000 (i.e. $4,700,000 – $3,700,000). This $1,000,000 is the gross profit obtained 
based on the so called ‘Straight Accrual Method’. (This method of calculating gross profit is rarely used 
in construction). The true gross profit (calculated by the Percentage of Completion Method shown just 
earlier) is $717,600, however. $1,000,000 – $717,600 = $282,400, and it can be seen that $282,400 is the 
over billing. In other words, the construction company billed the client for $4,700,000. It also incurred 
$3,700,000 as the ‘cost of revenue’, leaving it with $1,000,000 in hand. A part of this $1,000,000 is the 
true gross profit ($717,600), which belongs to the construction company, and the remaining part is over 
billing ($282,400), which belongs to the client.

Financial Statements – Income Statement and Balance Shee
A project can either be over billed or under billed and cannot be both. The above is an example of one 
project. A construction company usually has a number of projects in its hand at the same time. Some 
of the projects may be under billed and some may be over billed. Therefore, we can see that both under 
billing (current assets) and over billing (current liabilities) appear on the balance sheet.

Worked Examples
In this last section of Chapter 1, worked examples on the topics that have been discussed in this chapter 
are to be illustrated. There are eight short worked examples. It is hoped that readers will find them useful.
1.6.1	
Worked Example 1
At the end of the fiscal year 2012, ABC Construction Co. has the following financial profile:
Total assets
$1,000,000
Total liabilities
$700,000
Gross profit
$250,000
Total operating expenses
$210,000
a)	 What is the total net worth of this company?
Net worth = Equity (Owner’s capital)	 = Total assets – Total liabilities
	= $1,000,000 – $700,000 = $300,000
b)	 What is the Net profit after tax? (Assume a 25% tax rate)
Net profit before tax = Gross profit – Total operating expenses
= $250,000 – $210,000 = $40,000
Net profit after tax = $40,000 – $10,000 = $30,000

Worked Example 3
The following data regarding HJK Construction Company are:
Current assets
$450,000
Current liabilities
$350,000
Long-term liabilities
$640,000
Net worth
$340,000
a)	 What is the value of the company’s fixed assets?
Net worth + Total liabilities = Total assets
$340,000 + ($350,000 + $640,000) = ($450,000 + Fixed assets)
Fixed assets = $340,000 + $350,000 + $640,000 – $450,000 = $880,000

Worked Example 4
The founders of HJK construction company invested a total of $400,000 upon formation of the company 
two years ago. No dividends have been paid. Now the company has total assets of $170,000, current 
assets of $80,000, current liabilities of $95,000, and long-term liabilities of $50,000. Do you think that 
the company has been successful during its first two years of operations?
Before the start of the company, Equity = $400,000
After two years, Fixed assets = Total assets – Current assets = $170,000 – $80,000 = $90,000,
And, Equity = (Current Assets + Fixed Assets) – (Current Liabilities + Long term Liabilities)
= ($80,000 + $90,000) – ($95,000 + $50,000)
= $25,000
It shows that the company’s Equity has decreased from $400,000 to $25,000 in two years which means 
a severe loss in these two years.

Worked Example 5
The working capital of LMN Construction Company at 31 Dec 20012 is $70,000. Current assets are 
$120,000, total assets are $250,000, and the company owes no long-term liabilities. What is the balance 
of owner’s equity at 31 Dec 2012?
	 As we know: Working capital 	 =	 Current assets – Current liabilities
	
$70,000 	 =	 $120,000 – X
	
X	 =	 Current liabilities = $50,000
	
And since: Owner’s equity	 =	 Total assets – Total liabilities
	
=	 $250,000 – ($50,000 + 0) as long-term liabilities = 0
	
=	 $200,000

Worked Example 6
PQR Construction Co. expanded rapidly during 2012 by investing in new plant and equipment and other 
inventory. As a result, total assets increased from $400,000 at the beginning of 2012 to $700,000 at the 
end of 2012. The owner’s equity at the beginning of the year was $250,000 and the company’s net profit 
for the year was $50,000. Assuming the company paid no dividends during 2012,

a)	 what were the company’s total liabilities at the beginning and at the end of the year if there 
is no change in capital stock of the company during 2012?
At the beginning of the year, Assets 	 =	
Liabilities + Equity
$400,000 	 =	
Y + $250,000
Total liabilities 	 =	
Y = $150,000
At the end of the year, $700,000 	
=	
Z + ($250,000 + $50,000)
Total Liabilities = Z = $700,000 – $300,000 = $400,000
b)	 what were the company’s total liabilities at the end of 2012 if it received $200,000 in 2012 
from the sale of additional capital stock?
Though the company received $200,000 during 2012 from the sale of additional capital stock, 
Equity as well as Assets increased in the same amount, and hence Liabilities remain the same 
which is $400,000.
As at 31 Dec 2012, Assets	 =	 Liabilities + Equity
i.e. ($700,000 + $200,000) 	=	 $400,000 + ($300,000 + $200,000)
Or $900,000 	 =	 $400,000 + $500,000

Worked Example 7
The management of TUV Construction Company wishes to maintain a current ratio of 2 by reducing 
its short-term borrowing so as to achieve this result. The company’s cash balance is currently $40,000. 
Accounts payable are equal to $55,000 and the company is now having a short-term borrowing of $35,000 
from a bank. Inventory totals $95,000 and accounts receivable total $35,000. The current asset accounts 
consist of only cash, inventory, and accounts receivable; and the current liability accounts consist of only 
accounts payable and short-term bank loan payable. How much of its short-term bank loan should the 
company repay?
The problem can be presented by a table more clearly as follows:
Current Assets
Current Liabilities
Cash
$40.000
Accounts Payable
$55,000
Inventory
$95,000
Short term bank loan
$35,000
Accounts Receivable
$35,000
As the company wishes to maintain a current ratio of 2, it needs to pay back $10,000 to maintain such 
a ratio.

Financial Statements – Income Statement and Balance Shee
If the company uses $10,000 cash under current assets to pay back the short term bank loan under 
current liabilities, the short term bank loan will be $25,000 (i.e. $35,000 – $10,000).
Current liabilities = $55,000 + $25,000 = $80,000 
Current assets = $30,000 + $95,000 + $35,000 = $160,000
Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities = $160,000 / $80,000 = 2

$3,500,000
a)	 Determine the value of “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on works in 
progress” under the current asset account. (This is also called ‘under billings’)
Percentage of completion on contracts in progress
= (Cumulative costs incurred / Total estimated costs) × 100%
= ($3,150,000 / $4,500,000) × 100% = 70%
Revenue on contracts in progress = (Total contract sum) × (Percentage of completion)
= $5,400,000 × 70% = $3,780,000
Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on works in progress (or under billings)
= (Revenue on contracts in progress) – (Cumulative contract billings)
= $3,780,000 – $3,500,000 = $280,000
b)	 Compute the gross profit of the company applying the percentage-of-completion method.
Percentage of completion on current year’s completed contracts
= ($360,000 / $900,000) × 100% = 40%
Revenue on current year’s completed contracts
= $1,100,000 × 40% = $440,000
Percentage of completion on current year’s contracts in progress
= ($1,850,000 / $4,500,000) × 100% = 41.11%
Revenue on current year’s contracts in progress
= $5,400,000 × 41.11% = $2,220,000
Total revenue = $440,000 + $2,220,000 = $2,660,000
Total current year’s costs incurred = $360,000 + $1,850,000 = $2,210,000
Gross profit of the company = $2,660,000 – $2,210,000 = $450,000

Construction Company
2.1	
Analysis of Financial Statements by Financial Ratios
In financial statement analysis, Financial Ratios help a lot in indicating the financial health of a 
construction company. In this chapter, we are going to discuss these ratios first, and then to have a case 
study to see how we may use them to help management decisions. 
The financial ratios relevant to the construction industry can be classified into five categories. They are 
(1) Profitability Ratios, (2) Liquidity Ratios, (3) Working Capital Ratios, (4) Capital Structure Ratios, 
and (5) Activity Ratios. These ratios will be discussed in detail in Section 2.2.
2.2 	
Five Categories of Financial Ratios
In this section, we have to refer to Tables 1.1 and 1.2 of Chapter 1. The explanation of the financial ratios 
below will be based on these two tables – Income Statement and Balance Sheet (for 2012 only) – shown 
in Chapter 1.

Financial Statement Analysis of a Construction Company
2.2.1	
Profitability Ratios
Profitability ratios measure the construction company’s ability to earn profit from its operation. The 
three most commonly used profitability ratios are: 
Gross Profit Margin Ratio 	
= Gross profit / Revenue
	 = 8,098,000 / 40,185,000 = 20.15%
(The goal for net profit margin ratio is 25% minimum; if subcontractors (pay-as-paid basis) 
occupy a significant portion of the cost of revenue, the goal can be reduced to 20% minimum)
Net Profit Margin Ratio 	
= Net profit before tax / Revenue 
	
= 2,704,000 / 40,185,000 = 6.73%
(The goal for net profit margin ratio is 5% minimum)
Return on Equity Ratio 	
= Net profit before tax / Owners’ equity 
	
= 2,704,000 / 8,412,675 = 32.14%
(The return on equity ratio should be between 15% and 40%)
2.2.2	
Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios indicate the construction company’s ability to pay its obligations as they come due. The 
three most common liquidity ratios used are shown below.
Current Ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities 
= 12,289,500 / 8,450,835 = 1.45 
(The current ratio should be higher than 1.3 for a financially healthy construction company)
Acid Test Ratio (or Quick Ratio) = (Cash + Accounts receivables) / Current liabilities
= (2,589,000 + 5,767,000) / 8,450,835 = 0.99
(The acid test ratio or quick ratio should be higher than 1.1 for a construction company)
Current Assets to Total Assets Ratio = Current assets / Total assets
= 12,289,500 / 20,392,067 = 60.27%
(The current assets to total assets ratio should be between 60% and 80%)

Financial Statement Analysis of a Construction Company
2.2.3	
Working Capital Ratios
These ratios measure how well the construction company is utilizing its working capital. The three most 
commonly used working capital ratios are shown below.
Working Capital Turnover = Revenue / Working capital
= 40,185,000 / (12,289,500 – 8,450,835) = 10.47 times
(The working capital turnover should be between 8 and 12 times per year)
Net Profit to Working Capital Ratio = Net profit before tax / Working capital
= 2,704,000 / (12,289,500 – 8,450,835) = 70.44% 
(The net profit to working capital ratio should be between 40% and 60%)
Degree of Fixed Asset Newness = Net depreciable fixed assets / Total depreciable fixed assets
= 8,102,567 / 20,631,940 = 39.27% 
(The degree of fixed asset newness should be between 40% and 60%)
2.2.4	
Capital Structure Ratios
Capital structure ratios indicate the ability of the construction company to manage liabilities. These 
ratios also indicate the approach that the company prefers to finance its operation. The two major capital 
structure ratios are:
Debt to Equity Ratio 	= Total liabilities / Owners’ equity
	= 11,979,392 / 8,412,675 = 1.42
(The debt to equity ratio should be lower than 2.5)
Leverage	
= Total assets / Owners’ equity
 	
= 20,392,067 / 8,412,675 = 2.42
Or
Leverage 	
= Total assets / Owners’ equity 
	
= (Total liabilities + Owners’ equity) / Owners’ equity
	
= (Total liabilities / Owners equity) + 1
	
= Debt to Equity Ratio + 1
	
= 1.42 + 1 = 2.42

Financial Statement Analysis of a Construction Company
(The leverage should be lower than 3.5. Some construction companies prefer to use leverage 
of 3.5 or close to it but some conservative ones prefer to use a lower leverage. This relates to, 
of course, the use of a higher or lower debt to equity ratio by the company.)
2.2.5 Activity Ratios
Activity ratios indicate whether or not the construction company is using its assets effectively, and if 
yes, how effective they are. There are quite a number of activity ratios, and the seven commonly used 
ones are shown below.
Average Age of Material Inventory = (Material inventory / Materials cost) × 365 days
	
= (850,000 / 13,000,000) × 365 = 23.87 days 
(The average age of material inventory should be shorter than 30 days)
Average Age of Under Billings = (Under billings / Revenue) × 365 d
	
= (547,250 / 40,185,000) × 365 = 4.97 days
(The average age of under billings should be the shorter the better)

Average Age of Accounts Receivable = (Accounts receivable / Revenue) × 365 d
	
= (5,767,000 / 40,185,000) × 365 = 52.38 days
(The average age of accounts receivable should be shorter than 45 days)
Cash Conversion Period = Average age of material inventory + Average age of under billings 
+ Average age of accounts receivable 
= 23.87 + 4.97 + 52.38 = 81.22 days
(The cash conversion period should be shorter than 75 days)
Average Age of Accounts Payable = [Accounts payable / (Materials + Subcontracts)] × 365 d 
	
= [4,325,250 / (13,000,000 + 12,500,000)] × 365 
	
= 61.91 days 
(The average age of accounts payable should be shorter than 45 days)
Average Age of Over Billings = (Over billings / Revenue) × 365 d
	
	= (617,205 / 40,185,0 2 gl00) × 365 = 5.61 days
(Usually there is no guideline on average age of over billings)
Cash Demand Period = Cash conversion period – Average age of accounts payable 
– Average age of over-billings 
	
= 81.22 – 61.91 – 5.61 = 13.70 days
(The cash demand period should be shorter than 30 days)
Financial statement analysis involves the analyses of all the above ratios. We are going to have a case study 
in Section 2.3. We will see how we can use these ratios to analyze the financial health of a construction 
company by reviewing its income statement and balance sheet.
2.2	
A Case Study
First of all, the income statement and the balance sheet of the construction company under study are 
shown in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 respectively. The general manager of the company recently resigned. A new 
one has just been hired. The new general manager is reviewing the financial statements and hopes to 
find out the goods and the bads of the company and hence find ways to make improvement.

Financial Statement Analysis of a Construction Company
1.	 At the very first glance of the Income Statement, the new general manager notices that the 
revenue has increased by 6,174,101 from 34,701,250 in 2011 to 40,875,351 in 2012. The 
increment is about 17.79%. So, he is wondering if it is a very positive sign. After second 
thought, he reminds himself that this is only a preliminary analysis. Although it is correct to 
look at the trend of the revenue as a first step, he can only say that it might be a good sign 
but is too early to say that it is a very positive sign. Perhaps it is too early to be too happy 
about it. Further investigation on the financial statements is certainly necessary.

Financial Statement Analysis of a Construction Company
2.	 Very soon, the new general manger looks into the trend of the gross profit margin of the 
company. He finds that the gross profit margin ratios are 24.27% and 29.74% in 2012 and 2011 
respectively, representing a fall of 5.47%. He should be cautious about this fall as a fall in this 
ratio means less profit will be earned for every dollar of revenue generated. Also, the gross 
profit falls by 3.86% even though there is a rise of 17.79% in the revenue. It may be due to an 
increase in the cost of revenue without any increase in the contract price because of the highly 
competitive market at that moment, or unfavourable purchasing/markup policies, and so on. 
The general manager therefore should make a further investigation on the cost of revenue, that 
is, the costs of materials, labour, subcontracts, etc.
3.	 All items in the cost of revenue have a 2-digit increment in percentage except the labour cost, 
whose increase is insignificant (up by 0.28%). The general manager is even more impressive to 
find out that the labour cost as a percentage of the revenue has actually gone down (see vertical 
analysis of the income statement) while the revenue has gone up. One thing he needs to take 
note of is that the cost of subcontractors has risen by 35.92% compared to the previous year (see 
horizontal analysis). The reduction in labour cost may be due to the increase in subcontracts in 
2012. Anyway, the general manager needs to find out whether or not the reduction of labour 
has been really due to the increase of subcontracts as they are somehow interrelated. Keeping 
a certain level of direct labour in the company is essential and a balance has to be maintained 
between the company’s direct labour and subcontractors.
4.	 Upon further review of the Income Statement, the new general manager is rather disappointed 
by the performance of 2012 as there is a significant decrease of 52.63% in the net profit although 
the revenue has gone up. He requests a thorough study on the reasons for the decrease and 
a report from the management. He strongly thinks that the study is necessary and important 
because of such a discouraging performance. In fact, the net profit margin ratio is only 3.26% 
(see vertical analysis), which is well below the norm of the construction industry’s minimum 
5%. He is worrying about the company’s ability to achieve a satisfactory return on its investment. 
The rise of total variable overhead is 34.74% from 2011 to 2012 (see horizontal analysis). This 
rise certainly lowers down the operating profit considerably. When he looks into the items of 
the variable overhead, he is troubled by the acute rise of almost 2.5 times in the Travel and 
Entertainment cost. The increase of Bad Debts by 68.11% is also high. Both Truck, Vehicle & 
Equipment expenses and Insurance & Workers’ Compensation expenses have risen by almost 
35%. They are not good signs as well. A thorough investigation on “how? why? what?” of these 
expenses is also necessary. Why there is a big increase in the entertainment expenses? What are 
the guidelines in approving entertainment expenses? How is the collection policy on debtors? 
Does the Accounts Department follow the policy strictly? What kinds of debtors are they?

Financial Statement Analysis of a Construction Company
The total fixed overhead as 12.68% of the revenue in 2012 is a little down compared to 2011 
(see vertical analysis). Also, the increment is 8.99% in 2012 compared to 2011 (see horizontal 
analysis). Overall speaking, it is quite acceptable. However, the general manager needs to pay 
special attention to the sharp increases in Maintenance & Repair expenses of 82.13% and 
Utilities expenses of 55.34%.
5.	 While the general manger knows that the net profit margin ratio is lower than the industry’s 
norm, he also sees that 24.55% of a return on equity ratio is a satisfactory return in the industry. 
It is quite clear that the operation of the business has delivered a good return to the owners 
(partners or shareholders). Therefore, what he really needs to do now are those that have been 
said in Point 4. Doing them should be sufficient at the time being.
6.	 The general manager notes that the Maintenance and Repair cost in 2012 is much higher than 
that in 2011. This can be a signal to replace aging assets. The degree of fixed asset newness is 
found to be 47.99%. In fact, the overall indicator is healthy. Probably there are some particularly 
old assets among the fixed assets. In any case, the general manager needs to look closely into 
this matter so as to identify if there are really such old assets, and if yes, he should replace 
them in order to save repair costs. Furthermore, the high Maintenance and Repair cost may 
be due to poor management in cost control in that particular department which he should be 
responsible to rectify.

Financial Statement Analysis of a Construction Company
7.	 The general manager observes the declined working capital in 2012. However, he is not 
worrying about the company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations in the coming year 
(2013), because he thinks the current ratio of 1.65 (for 2012) is a very good one. On the top of 
that, the working capital turnover is 8.14 times. It has improved as compared to 2011. Actually, 
8.14 turns per year is a favourable level. Provided that the current ratio is healthy, if he can 
minimize the working capital so that fewer funds are tied up, he will be able to maximize cash 
flows,. Hence, the available cash can then be more profitably invested in the business.
8.	 Upon further review, the general manager finds that the quick ratio or acid test ratio is 1.10 
(just good enough according to the norm of the construction industry) for 2012. The general 
manager is convinced that the company is financially secure in short term obligations. The 
quick ratio is in fact a more rigorous assessment of a company’s short term financial ability 
than the current ratio. However, he cannot rely solely on the quick ratio itself as it provides no 
information about the timing of cash flows. The timing is crucial too as it really determines the 
ability of a company to pay debts when due. So it should be more meaningful to consider the 
quick ratio together with the cash demand period (Cash Demand Period is also called Cash 
Conversion Cycle – in days). In this case study, the cash demand period is 18.63 days, which 
is considered very satisfactory. Therefore, the company’s short term financial ability is good.
9.	 The general manager is interested to know how well the company can handle unpredictable 
future cash flows. A quick way to the answer is by looking at the debt to equity ratio of the 
company. For 2012 the ratio is 1.69, which is less than 2.5. The figure 1.69 is a healthy but rather 
low debt to equity ratio in some people’s eyes in the construction industry. It means that the 
borrowing capability of the company is strong to meet unpredictable expenses or to service its 
unexpected long term liability in the future. To some people, however, such a rather low debt to 
equity ratio cannot allow the company to earn a larger money with a limited equity (see Section 
4.4 of Chapter 4). The leverage is only 2.69, whereas the norm of the industry’s maximum can 
be 3.5. Yet, the general manager is a rather conservative man. He is satisfied with the debt to 
equity ratio being 1.69 and the leverage being 2.69. He is a debt averter, at least so at the time 
being when he is so new in the company. Even if he wants to take a bigger risk, it would not 
be now but would be in the future. He actually knows well the drawbacks of high debts.
Drawbacks of high debts:
a)	  L ow ability to handle unpredictable expenses.
b)	 Low ability to service unexpected long term liability.
c)	 Low grade of credit rating.
d)	 High interest expenses.
e)	 Sureties believe that construction companies with higher levels of working capital (i.e. lower 
current liabilities or lower debts) have a better chance of successfully finishing their projects.
f)	 Difficult to survive in economic downturn.
g)	 High risk in insolvency.

h)	 In general, the more debt a company has, the riskier its stockholder is, since debt holders 
have first claim to a company’s assets. So if a company becomes bankrupt, there may be very 
little left to its stockholders after the company has satisfied its debt holders.
10.	The general manager worries about the long period of average age of accounts receivable (54.69 
days is longer than the industry’s norm 45 days). He requests the management to have a better 
control on this aspect. His request is understandable especially when there is a sharp rise of 68% 
of bad debts in 2012 (see Point 4). In general, the greater the number of days outstanding, the 
greater the probability of delinquencies in accounts receivable. Also, the company is indirectly 
extending interest-free loans to its clients by maintaining accounts receivable. Therefore, it is 
correct for the general manager to ask the management to review its credit policies in order 
to ensure the timely collection of imparted credit. 
11.	The general manager is delighted with the efficacy of the inventory management as the average 
age of material inventory is 16 days for 2012 and 17 days for 2011, which are well within the 
industry’s norm – a maximum of 30 days. An efficient manager has to balance the fund tied 
up in inventory as well as meeting the needs of the projects in hand. For on the other hand, 
over aggressiveness in reducing the age of inventory may cause out of stock issues.
12.	Although the average age of accounts payable is higher than the normal practice 45 days, the 
general manager is not concerned about it at all. His philosophy is that the longer the payable 
days, the company will have more cash available in hand. However, on the other hand, he 
should not ignore building good relationship with his vendors. In fact, he needs the support 
and contribution from vendors from time to time to run his business efficiently and effectively. 
Moreover, the company can earn cash discount on timely payment as well as more favorable 
buying contracts from vendors, and there are both tangible and intangible benefits.

Compound Interest, Net Present Value (NPV),  
Equivalent Annual Cost and Loan Redemption
The bank interest rate 6% per year (or per annum) is also called “nominal rate” (or “apparent rate”). The 
term “nominal” means that the rate is not a “real rate”. In other words, the real value of the initial sum 
$100,000 does not grow at 6% per annum, but usually grows at a rate lower than 6% per annum because 
inflation usually exists. If we assume the inflation rate to be f % per annum, the nominal rate to be i' % 
per annum, and the real rate to be i % per annum, then we have the following approximate relationship:
i' = i + f 
(Eq 3.2)
It is an approximate relationship only and is nearly true if the values of i and f are small. The true 
relationship will be discussed in Chapter 5. If the inflation rate f in a year is very high, say, higher than the 
bank’s interest rate i ’ (nominal rate or apparent rate), then we will have a negative real interest rate. This 
means that if we put money into a bank we will in fact lose money, because the value of the accumulated 
amount we get is lower than the value of the principal amount we initially put. We must not forget one 
thing, that is, the bank’s interest rate is always a nominal rate, never a real rate. Investors, however, are 
only interested in the real rate, because only the real rate can reflect how much they really earn.
Now, let us take a look at an example how banks pay interests to their customers.
Example 3.1
a)	 A bank pays 6% interest per annum, but interest payment is on yearly basis. If $100,000 is

Compound Interest Calculations
In the discussion of compound interest mathematics, we want to make an assumption – an inflation-
free assumption, for the time being. We assume that there is no inflation in this world, and hence i 
is equal to i'. This assumption is of course not true in the real world. The purpose of making such an 
assumption temporarily is that we do not want to create confusion between nominal rate and real rate 
at the time being. We will remove this unrealistic assumption later after the next chapter and go back 
to live in the real world. 
3.2.1	
Uniform Series Compound Amount
In section 3.1, we have only considered a principal sum of single payment. Now we begin to see a series 
of uniform payments. For a series of uniform payments, let A = the periodic uniform payment made at 
the end of each period continuing for n periods to accumulate a sum S. The situation can be presented 
diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 3.1.

we have to rearrange terms to calculate A (A is usually referred to as Sinking Fund). In fact, we can

(0.22463 is found by substituting i = 0.04 and n = 5 into the formula, or from Appendix)	
It should be interesting to note that the answer of Example 3.3, which is $56,157, is exactly $10,000 
more than the answer of Example 3.2, which is $46,157. This is not a coincidence. The later part of this 
chapter will give hints to the explanation. Readers may know why it is so after they have finished reading 
Example 3.6, particularly the last part of it.

Compound Interest, Net Present Value (NPV),  
Equivalent Annual Cost and Loan Redemption
The value A in Example 3.3 is usually referred to as Equivalent Annual Cost as the period is defined as 
one year in the question. For example, the equivalent annual cost of owning the excavator in Example 3.3 
is $56,157 a year with i equal to 4% per annum. Comparatively, the annual cost of owning it is $50,000 
a year (i.e. 250,000 ÷ 5) if i is taken as 0% p.a. (i.e. zero interest rate; p.a. stands for per annum).

Present Value (Single payment and Uniform Series Payments)
Let us look at Fig. 3.5, which explains what Present Value is for a single payment.

Fig. 3.5 – Present value of a single payment F.
F would be equal to $16,289 if i is taken as 5% p.a. In other words, $16,289 of 10 years later is equivalent 
to $10,000 today, or we can say that the present value (i.e. today’s value) of $16,289 of ten years later is 
$10,000, because: 
$10,000 × ( 1 + 0.05 ) 10 = $16,289
Mathematically, the present value of F can be expressed in the form of:

Example 3.4
The construction cost of a service reservoir for supplying water to a housing estate is estimated to be 
$60,000,000. The annual operation and maintenance cost is estimated to be $2,500,000 per year. The 
annual income from the collection of water supply fees (for this service reservoir’s part) from the users 
will be $7,000,000. Assuming a time horizon of 30 years and taking i as 5% p.a., find out if the project 
is financially feasible.
The problem can be presented diagrammatically in Fig. 3.7 as follows:

Compound Interest, Net Present Value (NPV),

The two methods (a) and (b) must have consistent results. If the NPV is calculated to be positive, the 
NAB must also be calculated to be positive, and vice versa. Therefore, either one method only is sufficient 
to determine whether the project is feasible or not.
We should note that there exists a relationship between the results of methods (a) and (b):

If the B/C ratio is greater than 1, the project is worthwhile, and vice versa. When B/C ratio is exactly 1, 
the project is a break-even one. A project having a positive net present value or a positive net annual 
benefit must have a B/C ratio greater than 1. Similarly, a project having a negative net present value or 
a negative net annual benefit will have a B/C ratio less than 1.

Salvage Value and Equivalent Annual Cost
If the price of a new vehicle is $200,000, and if its price drops to $40,000 six years later, the vehicle is 
said to have a salvage value of $40,000 after six years. In general, the salvage value of an asset is its value 
after n years. (Readers are reminded that the inflation-free assumption is still valid). We usually use P 
to denote an asset’s initial cost, and R its salvage value. Diagrammatically, P and R can be presented as 
shown in Fig. 3.8.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The same conclusion can be drawn as Model B has a lower total equivalent annual cost.

Redeeming a Loan
The basic idea of compound interest is that, as seen in the previous sections, the interest is calculated 
based on the new balance for each period. If $100,000, say, is deposited in a bank and the interest rate is 
5% per annum, it becomes $105,000 (i.e. $100,000 × 1.05) at the end of the first year. The interest gained 
in the following year will be calculated based on the new balance $105,000, and this sum will grow to 
$110,250 (i.e. $105,000 × 1.05) at the end of the second year, and so on. The same basic idea applies to 
the interest charged to a loan, that is, interest will be charged based on the new balance (or the unpaid 
balance) of the loan. Let us take a look at several different repayment methods in recovering a loan of 
$100,000 in 5 years at i = 5% p.a.
NOTE: i is sometimes termed the cost of capital because one has to pay that percentage of money in 
order to obtain the capital. In this case, one has to pay $5,000 (5%) in order to obtain a loan of $100,000 
in the first year. Another name for i is discount rate.

Although the total amount of annual installment for Repayment Method 1 ($115,000) is less than that 
for Repayment Method 2 ($117,500), it would be wrong to say that Method 1 is a better alternative 
merely because of its lower value of total amount of annual installments. It is wrong to say so because 
the present values of the two methods are the same.
Now let us look at another method – Repayment Method 3.

Table 3.3 – Single principal amortization for a loan of $100,000
The present value of the annual installments for this method will of course be the same again, i.e. $100,000, 
if i is taken as 5 percent per annum. The verification is left to the readers.
We should pay attention to columns (3) and (4) of Table 3.3. Apparently, the annual interest seems  
like simple interest calculation, giving $5,000 of interest constantly from Year 1 to Year 5. The  
calculation has been based on the multiplication of the principal sum by the interest rate  
(i.e. P × i = $100,000 × 5% per annum), which looks similar to the method of simple interest calculation. 
However, the interest payment shown in Table 3.3 is in fact calculated by compound interest principle, 
with the new balances (i.e. column 3) remain unchanged at $100,000, the same as the principal, over the 
whole period of loan recovery of five years. In such a case, the interest is actually charged annually to 
the new balance (i.e. compound interest principle), as if it is charged to the principal sum.
3.6	
Principal Amortization and Interest Payment of a Loan 
In redeeming a loan, the redeeming amount is divided into two parts: (1) principal amortization, and 
(2) interest payment. The first part principal amortization does not include interest at all. The total 
amount amortized during the total period of the loan should be exactly equal to the loan itself. The 
words “amortized” and “amortization” have already appeared in Example 3.6. The second part interest 
payment is for paying the “cost of capital” (see the NOTE immediately before Example 3.6). We are going 
to illustrate these in Example 3.7.
Example 3.7
A company has borrowed $100,000 from a bank which charges the former 5% interest p.a. The loan has 
to be recovered in 5 years compounded annually.

a)	 How much should the company pay at the end of each year to the bank (assuming uniform 
payment)?
b)	 The bank changes the interest rate to 4% p.a. at the beginning of the third year. What will be 
the amount of the company’s last payment (i.e. payment at the end of year 5) if it keeps on 
paying the bank the same amount as calculated in (a) above at the end of years 3 and 4?
c)	 Continued from (b), what will be the company’s repayment schedule if it chooses to pay 
back the bank in the form of uniform payments at the end of years 3, 4 and 5?

In the above table, for year 1, interest = 100,000 × 5% = 5,000. The principal amortization = 23,097.48 – 5,000 
= 18,097.48, and therefore the remaining principal = 100,000 – 18,097.48 = 81,902.52. For year 2, 
interest = 81,902.52 × 5% = 4,095.12, and the principal amortization = 23,097.48 – 4,095.12 = 19,002.36, 
and hence the remaining principal = 81,902.52 – 19,002.36 = 62,900.16. Similar calculations are  
applied to years 3, 4 and 5. The final remaining principal would naturally be equal to zero at the end of year 5.
It is interesting to note that the five figures under the column Principal amortization sum up to exactly 
the loan amount $100,000. The same is true for parts (b) and (c) below.
b)	 In the part (b) table, only the first two rows (years 1 and 2) are similar to the part (a) table 
(5% p.a. interest rate). For years 3, 4 and 5, interest = principal unpaid × 4%.

Exercise Questions for Chapter 3
Exercise Question 1
The pavement of a road requires $400,000 per year to maintain. The feasibility of a new pavement is being 
considered for reducing maintenance costs. If the new pavement needs no maintenance in the first three 
years, then $200,000 per year for the next seven years, and then $400,000 per year thereafter, what is the 
immediate expenditure for the new pavement that is justifiable? (Assume a discount rate of 10% p.a.).
Exercise Question 2
A contractor borrowed $500,000 from a bank to buy earth-moving equipment with an estimated service 
life of 10 years. The bank charged the contractor 12% interest p.a. and required him to pay back the 
loan in 10 years’ time.
a)	 Assuming that the contractor paid back the bank in 10 equal instalments (once every year), 
calculate the amount of each end-of-year payment.

b)	 The contractor at the end of year 4 wished to make an early redemption (i.e. pay all the 
money that he owed the bank). How much should he pay?
c)	 The bank negotiated with the contractor and reduced the interest rate to 10% p.a. at the 
beginning of the 5th year in order to attract the contractor to stay borrowing. What would 
be the contractor’s repayment schedule if he chose to pay back the bank in the form of six 
uniform payments from the end of years 5 to the end of year 10?
d)	 If the bank changed the interest rate back to 12% p.a. at the beginning of the 8th year, what 
would be the amount of the contractor’s last payment (i.e. payment at the end of year 10) 
if he kept on paying the bank the same instalment as calculated in (c) above at the end or 
years 8 and 9?
Exercise Question 3
There are two alternatives to construct a storage house. Both serve the purpose of allowing construction 
materials to be stored in the house. However, due to different construction methods (one is made of 
wood and the other made of bricks), different life spans and cash flow patterns are associated with each 
alternative as follows:
Alternative 1 (wood)
Alternative 2 (bricks)
Life
10 years
15 years
Initial capital cost
$900,000
$1,300,000
Operation and maintenance cost
$80,000 p.a.
$20,000 p.a.
     	
	
  
Assuming the discount rate to be 16% p.a., choose the better alternative by:
a)	 the present value method, and
b)	 the equivalent annual cost method.
(Hints: compare the alternatives based on the same number of years, i.e. 30 years)
Exercise Question 4
We have seen from Section 3.5 (or Example 3.6) of Chapter 3 that no matter what methods we use to 
pay back a loan, the sum of the present values of the payments is a constant value, equal to the principal 
amount borrowed. Prove mathematically to show that such a phenomenon is always true.
Exercise Question 5
We have seen from Section 3.6 (or Example 3.7) of Chapter 3 that the number is zero at the bottom-
right corner of the table in Part a) of the example. Prove mathematically to show that this is always true 
for all cases in general.

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the  
Differences between IRR and NPV
Net Cash Flow (NCF in short) of a certain year is defined as (Cash-in – Cash-out) in that year. The 
NPV (net present value), which has been discussed in Section 3.2 of Chapter 3, can be calculated by 
Equation 4.1 as follows:
NPV =

(Eq 4.1)
As shown in Example 3.4 of Chapter 3, we can use NPV to find whether or not a project is viable. If 
the value of NPV is positive, then the project is viable, and vice versa. When such a method is used, we 
need to have a pre-determined i value to calculate the NPV. 
In this chapter, however, we will use a different approach to find whether or not a project is viable. The 
Discount Cash Flow (DCF in short) method will be introduced, and this method associates with the 
Internal Rate of Return (IRR in short). We will see these in Section 4.2.
4.2	
DCF Method and IRR
In the DCF (Discount Cash Flow) method, we do not need to have a pre-determined i. Instead of using 
Equation 4.1 to find the NPV, we set NPV equal to zero, that is:

(Eq 4.2)
We then solve Equation 4.2 and find the value of i. The solution of the variable i is called the IRR – internal 
rate of return. Equation 4.2, however, is difficult to solve, especially when n is large. Therefore, we rarely 
solve the equation algebraically, but usually use a numerical method, called DCF method, to find the 
solution of i in Equation 4.2. The following example illustrates how we can use DCF method to find IRR.
Example 4.1
Find the IRR of an investment of $50,000 whose receipts in the next four years are $15,000, $15,000, 
$20,000 and $20,000 respectively. Is this investment viable if the minimum desirable rate of return is 
10% p.a.?

Table 4.2 – IRR calculation by DCF method
The first four columns in Table 4.2 (including ‘End of Year’, (1), (2) and (3)) are the same as Table 4.1. 
The 12% p.a. in Column (4) is entered arbitrarily, and the figures in this column can be calculated using 
the present value formula or simply be copied from the Appendix. In Column (5), (DCF)12% tells us the 
PV ( present value) of each row of NCF at a 12% p.a. discount rate. Column (6) is similar to Column 
(4) and Column (7) is similar to Column (5), except that 16% p.a. instead of 12% p.a. discount rate is 
used this time. This 16% p.a. is also entered arbitrarily. The sum of the figures in Column (5) is 2,297, 
and this represents the NPV (net present value) of the NCFs at i = 12% p.a. (see Equation 4.1). Similarly, 
Column (7) tells us that the NPV of the NCFs is -2,061 at i = 16% p.a.
So, if i = 12% p.a., NPV = 2,297, and if i = 16% p.a., NPV = -2,061. There exists a value of i where 12% 
p.a. < i < 16% p.a. such that the NPV would be equal to zero, satisfying Equation 4.2. So, this value of 
i, by its mathematical definition, is the IRR, whose approximate value can be calculated by the “similar 
triangles method” as follows:
i = 12% + 






+
061
,2
297
,2
297
,2
 × (16 – 12)% = 14.11% p.a.
The above IRR (14.11% p.a.) is not very accurate because by similar triangles method we have assumed 
the NPV vs. i curve to be linear between the interval 12% and 16% of the i axis, but in fact it is not 
(Equation 4.1 is not linear). We can get a more accurate answer by narrowing down the interval, say, 
between 13.5% and 14.5% (instead of 12% and 16%) and carry out the whole process of Table 4.2 again. 
A more accurate answer will be obtained by doing this second iteration. Computer programs have been 
developed to be able to calculate a very accurate IRR by performing much such iteration. This was why 
we entered 12% and 16% (or any other percentages) arbitrarily at the first instant; we can finally obtain 
the same IRR anyway.

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the  
Differences between IRR and NPV
In Microsoft Excel, a built-in function is provided for calculating IRR. For Example 4.1, we can enter 
-50000 in Cell A1 (or any other cell we like). If we have entered it in Cell A1, then we have to enter 15000, 
15000, 20000 and 20000 in Cells A2, A3, A4 and A5 respectively. If we want to have the answer (a very 
accurate IRR) in Cell A7 (or any other preferred cell), then in this cell we enter =IRR(A1:A5) and then 
press Enter. A very accurate IRR answer will appear in this cell, and in this example it is 14.04%. Another 
built-in function of Microsoft Excel allows us to calculate NPV. If we enter =NPV(12%,A2:A5)+A1 in a 
cell and then press Enter, then the NPV 2,297 (see Table 4.2) will appear in this cell.
So far we have discussed the mathematical definition of IRR and the method to obtain it. But what does 
IRR mean in practice, that is, what does 14.04% p.a. represent? The following explains it. If we borrow 
$50,000 from a bank, and pay the bank $15,000 after one year, $15,000 after two years, $20,000 after 
three years, and $20,000 after four years, then the bank is actually charging us 14.04% p.a. interest rate. 
Or we may put it in another way: if we put $50,000 in a business, and the net incomes in the next four 
years are $15,000, $15,000, $20,000 and $20,000 respectively, then the rate of return of our investment 
is 14.04% p.a. This 14.04% p.a. is a constant rate throughout the whole period of four years. This is the 
practical meaning of IRR. Since the IRR is 14.04% p.a. and is greater than the minimum desirable rate 
of return 10% p.a. (given by the question), the investment is viable.
As a reminder, NPV method can also be used to find the viability of this investment. We can use Equation 
4.1 with i = 10% p.a. (the minimum desirable rate of return) to calculate the NPV. If the NPV is positive, 
the investment is viable, and vice versa. In this example, NPV is of course positive.

as it allows for the capital investment to be offset against the incomes over the life of the investment. What 
follows is a very simple example illustrating this point. If we invest $1,000 and the life of the investment 
is 1 year, and the income is $1,100 at the end of year 1 (i.e. the end of the life of the investment), then 
the gain is $100 and the IRR is 10% p.a. So we can see that $1,000 has depreciated in this 1 year. In 
performing financial analysis, we have to be careful that depreciation is not double-counted, since the 
DCF method takes account of depreciation automatically. We will see such examples in Chapter 7.
4.3	
IRR versus NPV
The NPV (net present value) and the IRR (internal rate of return) are the two most common and important 
indicators for capital investments. These two indicators, however, have intrinsic differences between one 
and the other. Some people take the view that IRR is more cognitively efficient than NPV, because IRR is 
expressed as a percentage (or a rate of return) while NPV is just a monetary value cognitively inefficient 
to decision makers. However, some people take the view that NPV is more conceptually “correct” despite 
the fact that IRR may be more popular than NPV, and that NPV is more theoretically sound because 
IRR may be too “capricious” or “fickle” and sometimes does not rank some projects in the same order 
as NPV does. We have to examine this in detail.
If there are two alternatives (A and B, say) for us to rank (or to prioritize), we may use either (1) highest 
IRR criterion, or (2) highest NPV criterion. It is important to note that the results of the two criteria 
may be consistent with each other or may be not. The NPV vs. i curves of Alternative A and Alternative 
B are plotted in Fig. 4.1. We should note that the two curves representing the two alternatives are not 
linear but for convenience sake we just draw them linear.

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the  
Differences between IRR and NPV
From Fig. 4.1, Alternative A is better than Alternative B if criterion (1), highest IRR, is used, since IRRA 
is greater than IRRB. For i > r, the NPV of Alternative A is higher than that of Alternative B so according 
to criterion (2), highest NPV, Alternative A is better than Alternative B. Hence, the two criteria give 
consistent ranking. For i < r, however, the NPV of Alternative B is higher than that of Alternative A, 
but IRRA is greater than IRRB, hence the two criteria give inconsistent ranking. Let us see Example 4.2.

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the  
Differences between IRR and NPV
The use of NAB, as discussed in the last part of Section 3.2 of Chapter 3, would have a ranking similar to 
that of NPV. The use of B/C ratio, as defined in Section 3.3 of Chapter 3, would have a ranking similar 
to that of IRR, because B/C is a ratio and somehow reflects a kind of ‘rate of return’, though it is not the 
same as IRR. The verification of the above statements is left as exercise to the readers.
In comparing multiple alternatives, we should use the highest NPV criterion and not the highest IRR 
criterion. The highest IRR criterion may lead to wrong conclusion. The next example (Example 4.3) and 
the next section (Section 4.4) discuss why it is so in detail.
Example 4.3
This example is an extension of Example 4.2. In addition to Alternatives A and B, we now have Alternative 
C. Their details are shown below:

Table 4.3 – NPV and IRR Rankings of Alternatives A, B and C
We can see that NPV and IRR methods give us different rankings of the alternatives. As said above, the 
NPV ranking is the correct ranking. The IRR ranking leads to wrong conclusion.
However, there is a method called Incremental IRR Analysis that will give us the result consistent with 
the NPV ranking (correct ranking). We are going to see how the incremental IRR analysis is used to 
rank the three alternatives.
First, we arrange the alternatives in an increasing order of initial capitals. In Example 4.3, we have 
already done this because the initial capitals of Alternatives A, B and C are $5,000,000, $7,000,000 and 
$11,000,000 respectively, already in an increasing order. (Otherwise, we would have to change A, B and 
C to, say, B, C and A, or whatever they might be).
Second, we compare Alternative A and Alternative B. The better alternative is determined by comparing 
the incremental IRR with the predetermined discount rate (or the minimum desirable rate of return) 
which is 6% p.a. in this example. The definition of incremental IRR is simply the IRR calculated from 
the incremental NCF. The incremental NCF is the difference of the NCF of Alternatives A and that of 
Alternative B, or more exactly, NCF of Alternative B minus NCF of Alternative A. If the incremental 
IRR is larger than 6% p.a., then Alternative B is better than Alternative A, and vice versa. Let us see 
how we do this below.

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the  
Differences between IRR and NPV
As defined before, the incremental IRR is the IRR of the Incremental NCFB-A, and is found to be 8.1% 
p.a. Since 8.1% p.a. is larger than 6% p.a., the minimum desirable rate of return, Alternative B is better 
than Alternative A. So, Alternative A is out and Alternative B is left behind for further consideration.
Third, we compare Alternative B and Alternative C. We repeat the process in a similar way to see whether 
Alternative C is better than Alternative B, or vice versa. This is done below.

The incremental IRR of the incremental NCFC-B is found to be 2.8% p.a. Since 2.8% p.a. is smaller than 
6% p.a., Alternative B is better than Alternative C. So, Alternative B is the best overall. Therefore, the 
incremental IRR ranking is consistent with the NPV ranking. In the following section, we will see why 
NPV is more reliable in engineering economy sense.
4.4	
IRR as Financial Indicator and NPV as Economic Indicator
As said before, IRR and NPV have intrinsic differences between one and the other. There is a more 
fundamental definition given to the two. The definition is: NPV is an economic indicator and IRR a 
financial indicator. In other words, NPV gives the society’s point of view and IRR the private investor’s 
point of view. Because IRR functions as a financial indicator, its value varies with the change of financial 
arrangement (e.g. change of equity-loan ratio) of a capital investment. NPV, however, does not vary when 
financial arrangement varies, because it functions as an economic indicator. Example 4.4 illustrates this. 
Example 4.4 – an illustrative example
If an investor has an all-equity case investment (i.e. no borrowing from bank; the capital is totally provided 
by the investor) in which an initial capital outlay of $10,000 leads to a receipt of $5,000 each year for 
three years as shown in Table 4.4, the investor obtains an IRR of 23.4% p.a.

If the investor uses $4,000 as the equity of the investment and borrows $6,000 as a loan (paying 10% interest 
per annum), making a total of $10,000 serving as the initial capital outlay of the same investment, then 
the net annual receipts in the next three years, having deducted the three annual principal amortizations 
and the annual interest payments from the gross annual receipts, are calculated to be $2,400, $2,600 and 
$2,800 as shown in Table 4.5 below.

Table 4.5 – Net Annual Receipts for Uniform Principal Amortization of $2,000 for Loan $6,000
In other words, the investor will obtain $2,400, $2,600 and $2,800 in Years 1, 2 and 3 respectively if he 
initially invests $4,000 (the equity). The cash flows of the investment become those as shown in Table 4.6. 
It should be noted Table 4.4 and Table 4.6 represent the same investment, although they have different 
financial arrangements. One should have no advantage over another as far as the economic value of 
the investment is concerned.

Table 4.6 – Cash Flows with $4,000 as Equity and $6,000 as Loan
The IRR is 41.2% p.a. for the cash flows of Table 4.6, which is higher than 23.4% p.a. as calculated from 
the cash flows shown in Table 4.4. This indicates that the financial arrangement of $4,000 equity and 
$6,000 loan is financially better than the all-equity case, although the economic value of the investment 
is unchanged (see below). If the NPV method is used to compare these two sets of cash flows, namely, 
Tables 4.4 and 4.6, or (-10,000, 5,000, 5,000, 5,000) and (-4,000, 2,400, 2,600, 2,800), using i = 10% p.a.

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the  
Differences between IRR and NPV
Now, a further case is to be investigated. If the investor uses only $1,000 as equity and borrows $9,000 
as loan at 10% p.a. interest rate, the cash flow will become (-1,000, 1,100, 1,400, 1,700), and the IRR 
calculated is 113.1% p.a., which is much higher than 23.4% p.a. (calculated from Table 4.4) and also 
41.2% p.a. (calculated from Table 4.6). The NPV, however, is the same (i.e. $2,434.26). Verification of 
the NPV is left to the readers.
A mathematical proof for the NPV to remain constant in different financial arrangement situations as 
shown in Example 4.4 can be found from the following journal article:
Tang, S.L. and Tang, H. John (2003). The variable financial indicator IRR and the constant economic 
indicator NPV. Engineering Economist. Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 69–78.
We have seen that the IRR becomes higher if a bigger loan is borrowed, although the economic value 
(indicated by the NPV) of the investment remains the same in all situations. This is because the borrowing 
interest rate 10% p.a. is smaller than the all-equity case IRR 23.4% p.a. If the borrowing interest rate is 
not 10% p.a. but higher than the all-equity IRR, then an exactly opposite effect will occur, that is, the 
higher the loan is, the lower the IRR will be.
To summarize, the NPV of a capital investment is constant in all situations and is not affected by the 
variation of financial arrangements. IRR, however, varies with the change of financial arrangements. 
NPV is an economic indicator for a capital investment, as the economic value of an investment does 
not change even its financial arrangement changes. The IRR, however, is suitable for use as a financial 
indicator, since private investors usually like to play around with financial arrangements to optimise 
their rates of return.

Effect of Inflation
5	 Effect of Inflation
5.1 	
Introduction
In Chapters 3 and 4, all discussions are based on the assumption that we are living in an inflation-free 
world. However, such an assumption is not true. The world is not inflation-free. In this chapter, we are 
going to remove this unrealistic assumption, that is, the first paragraph of Section 3.2 of Chapter 3 that 
i (real rate) is equal to i' (nominal rate or apparent rate) is no longer true.
5.2	
Real IRR and Its Calculation in a World with Inflation
Section 4.2 of Chapter 4 shows that in an inflation-free world the real IRR can be calculated by solving 
Equation 4.2, which is reproduced below and renamed as Equation 5.1.

However, in a world with inflation, the real IRR must be calculated from Equation 5.2 as follows:

NCF2 = the actual net cash flow of year 2 in a world with inflation

:
NCFn = the actual net cash flow of year n in a world with inflation
The effect of i devalues the future cash flows. The effect of f (inflation), similar to i, also devalues the 
future cash flows. The factors (1 + i ) and (1 + f     ), therefore, are both put as denominators in Equation 5.2.
If inflation is expected to be the same in every year within the life of the project, then: 
f1 = f2 = … = fn = f

f can also be regarded as the average inflation rate within those n years. The IRR (solution of i) calculated 
from Equation 5.3 is real. The apparent (or nominal) IRR can be calculated from Equation 5.4. The 
solution of i' from Equation 5.4 is of course apparent and not real.

(Eq 5.4)
By comparing Equations 5.3 and 5.4, we can observe that:
(1 + i') = (1 + i) (l + f )
(Eq 5.5)
or 	
i' = (1 + i)( 1 + f ) – 1
(Eq 5.5a)
From Equation 5.5a, i' = 1 + i + if + f – 1
i.e. i' = i + if + f
If i and f are small, then i×f is nearly equal to zero, and so
i' = i + f
(Eq 5.6)
Note that Equation 5.6 is Equation 3.2 in Section 3.1 of Chapter 3. It is an approximation of Equation 5.5a 
if i and f are small. Equation 5.5a is the true one.
Example 5.1
An asset was purchased four years ago at $60,000 and had a life of 4 years. This investment resulted in 
actual annual cash receipts of $14,000, $18,000, $23,000 and $28,000 respectively in the past 4 years. 
These figures are found from the accounting record of each year in the past 4 years. The average inflation 
rate in these four years was 3% p.a. Find the real IRR.
Answer:
First, find the apparent (nominal) IRR i' using Equation 5.4. We use the numerical method as described 
in Section 4.2 of Chapter 4 to find this i'.

Effect of Inflation
Solving for i gives i = 8.12%
Therefore, the real IRR is 8.12% p.a. (answer).
5.3 	
When Is Inflation Adjustment Considered Or Not Considered?
Suppose we look back to a finished 10-years investment (2002 to 2012, say) and from a search of the 
accounting records we have the data as shown in Table 5.2.
End of year

: 	
 :
NCF10 (based on 2012 money value)
	
Table 5.2 – NCFs of money value in respective years
The cash flows are actual transactions of those ten years so NCF0 represents the money value of 2002, 
NCF1 represents the money value of 2003, NCF2 represents the money value of 2004, and so on. This 
is only possible when the accounting records are kept because reference to the records is essential in 
getting these data. Example 5.1 is of this kind of data. For such cash flow data, the NPV in real terms 
(NPVreal) is calculated by Equation 5.7 as follows:

We only know the money value of 2013 well because we do the planning in this year. All the cash flows 
in the next 10 years are estimated based on the 2013 money value. We call these as ‘constant base year 
prices’. In such a case, the NPV in real terms (NPVreal) is calculated by Equation 5.10 (similar to Equation 
4.1 of Chapter 4) as follows:

(Eq 5.10)
The NPV calculated is real because all NCFs are of constant base year prices. It can be proved 
mathematically. The following shows the proof.
The cash flows shown in Table 5.3 (constant base year prices) can be changed to actual transactions as 
shown in Table 5.2. This is done in Table 5.4.

Effect of Inflation
Therefore, inflation although influences both revenues and costs, but the effect of inflation on both 
revenues and costs will cancel out each other. There is no need to consider inflation for cash flows which 
are based on constant year prices (i.e. Table 5.3). In Example 3.4 of Chapter 3, we can easily see that the 
annual operation and maintenance cost $2.5 million and the annual income $7 million are of constant 
base year prices, otherwise how can they remain unchanged for 30 years? During these 30 years (life of 
the project), the annual operation and maintenance cost will increase with the inflation rate. The same 
will happen to the annual income. Inflation may indeed influence both cost and income to differing 
degrees, but such impacts are of short duration. Usually, the effect of inflation on both cost and income 
will cancel out each other in the long run to regain a balance.
5.4 	
Concluding Remarks
In planning construction projects, we can only use constant base year prices to estimate our cash flow 
data (i.e. Table 5.3). So we do not have to consider inflation in calculating the real IRR or real NPV, 
whether in an inflation-free world or in a world with inflation. Inflation adjustment is not necessary for 
cash flows of this kind – constant base year prices. Examples 3.4 and 3.5 of Chapter 3 and Examples 4.1 
and 4.2 of Chapter 4 are examples of cash flows of constant base year prices.
However, Example 3.6 of Chapter 3 involves bank payments. We should note that all bank payments are 
NOT constant base year prices. But in this example we have not made any inflation adjustment. Why? 
It is because in this example we are using Equation 5.9 of this chapter (see Equations 3.10 and 3.11 of 
Chapter 3); bank interest rate is always nominal (i.e. i' ). The NPV calculated is therefore real too.
The only situation we have to be careful is Example 5.1. The cash flows in this example are those as 
shown in Table 5.2. For such a case, inflation adjustment is necessary. But this situation is rare. If we 
really come across cash flow data like this, we must make inflation adjustment.

Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
6	 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
6.1	
Introduction
Cost-volume-profit analysis usually involves the use of Break-even charts. Therefore, it is also called Break-
even analysis. The analysis and the break-even charts are to be fully discussed in this chapter. Examples 
on break-even chart applications will be illustrated for various situations of analyses in construction.
6.2	
Variable Costs, Fixed Costs and Break-even Point
A construction company expects that its Total Revenue (TR) is large enough to cover the following costs:
a)	 Direct costs (e.g. materials, labour, equipment, etc.)
b)	 Costs of administering the company
c)	 Costs of marketing/advertising
So, the company expects that:
TR > (a) + (b) + (c)
Or, TR = (a) + (b) + (c) + Profit

Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
However, if TR = (a) + (b) + (c) then the company neither makes any profit nor losses any money. For 
such a case, the company is operating at Break-even Point (BEP in short). If Total Cost is denoted by 
TC, then BEP is the Volume (amount of output) of the company at which TR = TC. We will discuss 
‘volume’ shortly, but before doing that we must explain what TC, total cost, is.
TC (total cost) is made up of VC (variable cost) and FC (fixed cost) as follows:
TC = VC + FC
(Eq 6.1)
VC (variable cost) includes direct materials, direct labour, equipment, fuel, etc. Variable cost varies with 
volume. Let volume = x so
	
VC is proportional to x
Or	
VC = v x
(Eq 6.2)
	
where v = variable cost per unit of x
FC (fixed cost) is constant, and is regardless of the level of the volume. Fixed cost includes rent, interest 
on investment, executive salaries, insurance, property taxes, etc. In practice, we usually talk about one 
year’s cost when we say the fixed cost amount.
Volume, as said above, is denoted by x, which is the number of units of output, usually in one year’s 
time. When volume changes, it will affect the profit or loss of the company. The following Example 6.1 
illustrates this.
Example 6.1
A construction material company makes and sells window panels. The selling price per panel is $900. 
The variable cost for making the window panels is $500 per unit. The fixed cost is $8,000,000. Find the 
BEP (break-even point).
Answer:
p = selling price per unit = $900
v = variable cost per unit = $500
FC = fixed cost = $8,000,000

Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
We can express our analysis in Table 6.1 as follows:
Volume
TR (Total Revenues)
x = 18,000
x = 20,000
x = 22,000
$900 × 18,000 
= $16,200,000
$900 × 20,000 
= $18,000,000
$900 × 22,000 
= $19,800,000
VC (Variable Cost)
FC (Fixed Cost)
$500 × 18,000 
= $9,000,000
$8,000,000
$500 × 20,000 
= $10,000,000
$8,000,000
$500 × 22,000 
= $11,000,000
$8,000,000
TC (Total Cost)

$18,000,000
$19,000,000
Net Income
($800,000)
Loss
0
BEP
$800,000
Profit
	
Table 6.1 – Cost-volume-profit analysis (or Break-even analysis)
We can see that breaking-even occurs when the volume x is 20,000 units. If x is smaller than 20,000 
units, the company will suffer a loss. If x is greater than 20,000 units, the company will have a profit. 
For example, if this company has a total (maximum) capacity of making 25,000 units of window panels 
in a year, then it will have a maximum profit of $2,000,000. Verification of it is left to the readers. 
Since the break-even point is at 20,000 units, we say that the BEP is at 80% of the company’s capacity  
(i.e. 20,000 / 25,000 = 80%).

Contribution
In Example 6.1, the construction material company sells one unit of the window panels it makes and 
gets $900 for it. Since the variable cost of that unit amounts to $500, and because $900 – $500 = $400, 
so $400 remains as a contribution per unit toward paying off the fixed cost. The concept of contribution 
is an important one in Cost-Volume-Profit analysis. Contribution is for paying off the fixed cost. If 
contribution can cover fixed cost, there will be profit, and vice versa. We will see an example that applies 
the concept of contribution.
Example 6.2
A subcontractor specialized in wastewater disposal makes and sells cast iron pipes, steel pipes and 
concrete pipes. The following variable costs and selling prices/sales volumes are obtained from the cost 
accounting department and sales department respectively.

Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
Answer:
Contribution per unit expressed in percentage = [(p – v) / p] × 100%
Contribution per unit due to cast iron pipes = [(3,000 – 2,000) / 3,000] × 100% = 33.33%
Contribution per unit due to steel pipes = [(3,500 – 2,500) / 3,500] × 100% = 28.57%
Contribution per unit due to concrete pipes = [(4,000 – 3,000) / 4,000] × 100% = 25.00%

28.33%
This 28.33% is the total contribution per overall sales dollars.
a)	 BEP = FC / Contribution = $200 m / 0.2833 = $706 m
Therefore, at BEP, the subcontractor is operating at 78.4% of capacity (i.e. 706/900=78.4%).
b)	 At 95% of capacity,
Profit = TR – TC 
= (900 m × 95%) – VC – FC
= 855 m – 855 m × (1 – 0.2833) – 200 m
= 855 m – 613 m – 200 m
= $42 million

The Make-or-Buy Decision
We have discussed the break-even chart in Section 6.3. The concept of the break-even chart can be applied 
to many decision problems. From this section onward, we are going to see three different applications 
in three examples. The first one is a make-or-buy decision problem as shown in Example 6.3.
Example 6.3
A site agent on a new construction site has to decide whether to supply concrete for his project by setting 
up a batching plant on his own site or to purchase concrete from a nearby ready-mixed concrete plant. He 
can purchase ready-mixed concrete at $400 per cubic meter. If he wants to set up a batching plant on site, 
he has to spend an equivalent annual cost of $500,000 as fixed cost, and the variable cost per cubic meter 
of concrete he makes is $150. Should he set up a batching plant on site so as to make his own concrete?

Fig. 6.2 – Break-even chart for the Make-or-Buy decision problem
The break-even chart suggests that if the site agent requires not more than 2,000 cubic meters of concrete 
in one year, to buy is more attractive than to make. But if he requires more than 2,000 cubic meters of 
concrete in a year, then to make is more attractive than to buy.

Equipment Selection Decision
The second example of applying the concept of break-even chart is on equipment selection decision. We 
are going to see how useful a break-even chart is.
Example 6.4
A construction company has three choices of the type of crane to be used on its sites. The choices are:
a)	 a fully automatic crane – this will add $900,000 a year to its fixed cost but the variable cost 
(hiring of operators, fuel, etc.) per hour will only be $40.
b)	 a semi-automatic crane – this will add $500,000 a year to its fixed cost but v (variable cost 
per hour) will be $200, since more operators will be needed.
c)	 a mainly hand operated crane – this will add $200,000 a year to its fixed cost , but v will be 
$500 per hour.
Which type of crane should the company choose?
The break-even chart is:
	
Hand- 
operated 
Semi- 
automatic 
Fully-automatic 
Slope 
= 500 
Slope 
= 40 
Slope 
= 200

Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
The break-even chart suggests that the hand operated crane has the lowest total cost up to a volume of 
1,000 hours of usage in a year. In the 1,000 hours to 2,500 hours range in a year, the semi-automatic 
crane has the lowest total cost. At volumes over 2,500 hours of usage in a year, the fully automatic crane 
has the lowest total cost.
6.8	
Engineering Scheme Choice Decision
We are going to see the third example on the application of break-even chart. In this example, formula 
introduced in Chapter 3 will be used.
Example 6.5

itemized costs of each scheme are shown below:

Fig. 6.4 – Break-even chart for the scheme choice decision problem
In Fig. 6.4, the slope of the line for Scheme A is 2, and those for Schemes B and C are 1.6 and 1.2 
respectively. The fixed costs for Schemes A, B and C are $43,140, $44,453 and $45,367 respectively. From 
this break-even chart, we see that for pumping time smaller than 2,784 hours per year, Scheme A is the 
best. For pumping time larger than 2,784 hours per year, Scheme C is the best. Scheme B is never to be 
used because it is in no situation better than Scheme A or Scheme C.
6.9	
Concluding Remarks
There are limitations in using cost-volume-profit analysis. It is useful only if the construction company has 
a good cost accounting system and adequate figures, which should be valid, accurate and readily available.
The cost-volume-profit analysis is not a tool for long range planning. Its use should be confined to only 
a not long duration. The analysis is usually limited to the budget period of a construction company, 
usually one calendar year.
The analysis presents only a simplified cost, volume and profit relationship. In reality, each is subject to 
outside influences and to the influences of the other two. The analysis, after all, should be regarded as a help 
to management decision, but not as a substitute for common sense, logical thinking and human judgment.

Financial Analysis of a Project
7	 Financial Analysis of a Project
7.1	
Introduction
In this chapter, we are going to see how we analyze the financial viability of a project. This chapter begins 
by describing the basic method employed to do financial analysis (financial analysis is different from 
financial statement analysis as described in Chapter 2). Then a more complicated case study will follow to 
show the detailed procedures of financial analysis. Readers will learn how to create an income statement 
and a balance sheet, the two most important financial statements as discussed in Chapters 1 and 2.
Readers should note that the two financial statements (income statement and balance sheet) are meant 
for the whole company for the examples in Chapters 1 and 2. However, these two financial statements 
discussed in this chapter are for a project only.
In a financial analysis,
1)	 depreciation of assets is tax deductible, and
2)	 interest on loan is also tax deductible.

Financial Analysis of a Project
For an all-equity investment case, there is no loan and hence no interest has to be paid so the only 
item that is tax deductible is depreciation. This can allow the analysis to be simpler. Example 7.1 in the 
next section (Section 7.2) is an example of such a case. Example 7.2 in the same section, however, is an 
equity-plus-loan case, and of course the analysis will be a little more complicated.
7.2	
Basic Method of Financial Analysis
Example 7.1 – An all-equity case
A small subcontractor is considering purchasing rock drilling equipment, which has a life of four years 
and costs $75,000. The average revenue generated per year is estimated to be $40,000 coming from 
rock drilling related works. The expense associated with maintaining the equipment is estimated to be 
$15,000 per annum. The profit tax rate is 25%. Assuming straight-line depreciation for the equipment 
and ignoring salvage value, carry out a financial analysis for the subcontractor. 
Answer:
Assuming straight line depreciation and zero salvage value after four years, the annual depreciation of 
the rock drilling equipment is $18,750 (i.e. 75,000 ÷ 4). An income statement can be produced as shown 
in Table 7.1.

Table 7.1 – Income statement for financial analysis
The net profit after tax of $4,687.50 per annum shown in the income statement, however, cannot be used 
to calculate the IRR. It must be adjusted such that depreciation is added back in order to avoid double 
counting so the DCF method will be correctly used for calculating the IRR (see the last part of Section 
4.2 of Chapter 4). This step is shown in Table 7.2.

Table 7.3 – All-equity case cash flows
We should note that in Table 7.2 depreciation is deducted first as cost because it is tax deductible. This 
step allows us to know how much the income tax payable is. In order to avoid double counting of 
depreciation in using the DCF method, we have to add depreciation back for the calculation of IRR.
Example 7.2 – (Equity + Loan) Case
Repeat doing Example 7.1 if the total capital of $75,000 is made up of $15,000 equity and $60,000 loan 
from a bank at an interest rate of 5% p.a. for a period of 3 years. The three end of year amortizations 
for the loan are equal, $20,000 each time. This time the financial analysis has to be modified. Carry out 
the modified financial analysis.

Table 7.5 – Cash flows used to calculate IRR
We must note that interest on loan, like depreciation, is tax deductible. Therefore, we can see from Table 
7.5 that interest expense has to be deducted first before tax expense is calculated. Amortization is not 
tax deductible because it is neither a cost of revenue nor an operating expense, and so it is considered 
only after the tax expense has been dealt with.
The cash flow table for IRR calculation is shown in Table 7.6:

Example 7.1. This is because the all-equity IRR (9.56% p.a.) is much higher than the interest rate on 
loan (5% p.a.). For such a case, the IRR will increase if a loan is borrowed. The NPV, however, remains 
stable. The NPV in Example 7.1 is about 15% lower than that in Example 7.2. They are not equal to 
each other (like Example 4.4 of Chapter 4) because the mathematical process has been disturbed by the 
subtraction of tax expense.

Financial Analysis of a Project
As a remark to Example 7.2, the revenue and cost for each of these four years are constant base year 
prices (see Sections 5.3 and 5.4 of Chapter 5). However, the interest expenses and the loan amortizations 
in the first three years are actual transactions (not constant year based). So, in Table 7.2, the numerical 
figures are a mixture of real and apparent (nominal) values. The real IRR should be even higher than 
20.44%, because the interest expenses and the amortizations could be adjusted to some lower values due 
to the effect of inflation if we want to convert them to constant base year prices.

A Case Study on Financial Analysis
We are going to see a more complicated example of financial analysis. It is a case study on analyzing the 
financial viability of a new project. Besides using the basic method as described in Section 7.2 which 
involves the income statement only, balance sheet and break-even chart are also used in this case study.
7.3.1	
The Proposed Project
The project is concerned with a special type of cement for construction use. It was initiated by a group of 
four professionals (the partners) – two engineers, one marketing specialist and one finance professional. 
One of the two engineers conducted the estimates of the new plant and equipment costs while the other 
estimated the cost of making this special type of cement. After completing the market study by the 
marketing specialist and the technical study by the two engineers, the finance person started the task 
of evaluating the financial viability.
7.3.2	
Summary of Market Study
a)	 Market share – the marketing specialist studied that the sales of the following number of 
bags of special cement would be feasible in the next ten years, including the consideration of 
the operational growth of the project in the first few years:
Target annual sales:
Year 1	
= 105,000 units (1 unit = 1 bag of special cement)
Year 2	
= 120,000 units
Year 3	
= 135,000 units
Years 4 – 10 	= 150,000 units
(See Note at the end of this chapter)
b)	 Price – the estimated price of each unit = $100 would be reasonable and competitive.
c)	 Selling expenses per unit = $3.33 (e.g. promoting, advertising, etc.)

Assumptions in financial analysis:
1.	 Accounts receivable = 1 month sales
2.	 Inventory:	
raw materials = 1 month usage
goods-in-process = 0.5 month of finished goods level
finished goods = 1 month of cost of goods sold
3.	 Trade credits = 1 month of raw materials purchased
4.	 Tax rate = 25% of net taxable income
5.	 Plant, equipment, etc. would follow straight-line depreciation; no depreciation on land
6.	 Pre-operation period = 1 year
7.	 All figures in Sections 7.3.2 and 7.3.3 were based on the money value of the year that the 
project was planned
7.3.4	
Pro-forma Income Statement and All-equity IRR
From the above data, the finance person prepared the pro-forma income statement and hence calculated 
the internal rate of return based on its performance forecasting. The pro-forma income statement was 
as follows (Table 7.7). All figures were constant base year prices.

Table 7.7 – Pro-forma income statement of the proposed project (× $1,000)
As explained in Section 7.2, the finance person added Depreciation to the Net Profit after Tax in order 
that the cash flows were suitable for calculating the IRR, as shown in Table 7.8.

Table 7.9 – All-equity cash flows of the proposed project (× $1,000)
* 5,050 + salvage value = 5,050 + (land cost + working capital) = 5,050 + (2,250 + 1,545) = 8,845
The all-equity IRR was found to be 23.48% p.a. It seemed to be a high return investment.
7.3.5	
Sources of Financing
These financial statements (7.3.2 through 7.3.4) were sent to a few banks/creditors. All showed interest 
in providing the four partners with loans because the proposed project looked promising as revealed by 
the financial statements. From these banks/creditors, the partners chose only two sources of financing. 
They were (1) a foreign supplier of equipment cum creditor and (2) a local bank, as detailed below.
1)	 A foreign supplier of equipment cum creditor showed its willingness to supply the project’s 
plant and equipment needs on the following terms:
a)	 15% down payment,
b)	 balance payable in 10 equal annual principal amortizations,
c)	 interest on the balance of 10% p.a. payable together with amortizations,
d)	 secured by a mortgage of plant and equipment.
2)	 A local bank agreed to lend up to 60% of the value of the land to be purchased for the 
project under the following terms and conditions:
a)	 payable in 3 equal annual principal amortizations,
b)	 interest of 12% p.a. on outstanding balance payable coincident with amortizations,
c)	 secured by a mortgage on the land.

Financial Analysis of a Project
Besides the above sources (1) and (2), the partners had to pool a total resource of at least $4,395,000 as 
the owners’ capital so that the total capital requirement of $16,795,000 could be satisfied. But the partners 
actually put $4,450,000 into the project which was more than enough. The equity and loan components 
were as follows (Table 7.10):
Equity (owners’ capital)
$4,450,000
Provided by the partners
Loan from Foreign Supplier
$13,000,000 × 85%
= $11,050,000
Loan for 10 years, 10% p.a. interest 
on the balance
Loan from Local Bank
$2,250,000 × 60%
= $1,350,000
Loan for the first 3 years, 12% p.a. 
on the balance
Total = $16,850,000 > $16,795,000, OK

Table 7.13 – Equity-Plus-Loan NCF of the proposed project (× $1,000)
* 3,862 + salvage value = 3,862 + (land cost + working capital) = 3,862 + (2,250 + 1,545) = 7,657
The IRR was found to be 44.93% p.a., an extremely profitable project with the said loans coming into 
the picture. Very good dividends could be seen from Item 14 of Table 7.12.

The Balance Sheet
For the balance sheet of this proposed project, it could be created based on the final income statement. 
It is shown in Table 7.14. The steps of creating it were as follows:
(Only the steps for Year 1 would be described; steps for other years would be the same)
Step 1: Enter 875,000 against the row Receivables
Step 2: Enter 175,000 against the row Raw materials
Step 3: Enter 190,000 against the row Goods-in-process
Step 4: Enter 380,000 against the row Finished goods
Step 5: Enter 2,250,000 against the row Land
Step 6: Enter 13,000,000 against the row Plant, equipment, buildings
Step 7: Enter -1,300,000 or (1,300,000) against the row Less accumulated depreciation
Step 8: Enter 13,950,000, sum of Fixed Assets (Steps 5 through 7), against Sub-total
Step 9: Enter 175,000 against the row Accounts payable

So, the column for Year 1 of the balance sheet had been completed. The same method was applied to all 
other columns so a complete balance sheet (Table 7.14) could be obtained.
7.3.8	
The Break-even Chart
The break-even chart for the 4th year of operation was as shown in Fig. 7.1 next page. It was drawn by 
referencing to Year 4 column of Table 7.12 (the final income statement). Year 4 was chosen because 
it was the first year of full (100%) operation. In the break-even chart (Fig. 7.1), the revenue line 
is represented by y=100x. The VC (variable cost) line is represented by y=46.66x, because the total 
variable cost for producing 150,000 units of cement bags was $7,000,000 (see Table 7.12). The FC+VC 
(fixed cost + variable cost) line is represented by y=46.66x+1,700,000 because the fixed cost (excluding 
depreciation) was $1,700,000 in the 4th year. The next line is including depreciation, and is represented by 
y= 46.66x+3,000,000. The next line is, besides VC, FC and depreciation, including interest expense also, 
and is represented by y= 46.66x+3,774,000, because the interest expense in the 4th year was $774,000. The 
next line (the last one) is, besides all, including the tax expense. It is represented by y=46.66x+4,831,000 
because $1,057,000 of tax was added to the fixed cost.
The revenue line intersects with the other five lines at five different points, including the one at the origin. 
If all costs (including tax expense) were considered, the breakeven point was at a volume of 90,581 units. 
Therefore, the BEP was at 60.4% capacity of the proposed project (i.e. 90,581 / 150,000) in the 4th year 
of operation. Readers may find out the break-even points of other years of operation by themselves.

Note: For a medium scale project, the time horizon used for financial analysis is usually ten years (i.e. 
n = 10 years). For small scale projects, n is taken as 4 or 5 years. For large scale projects, n is taken as 
25 or 30 years. For huge infrastructure projects, n can be taken as long as 50 or 60 years.
The project described in Section 7.3 is considered as medium scale and so n is taken as 10 years.

Exercise Questions for Chapter 7
Exercise Question 1
A construction company is considering setting up a new precast concrete yard. To do so, a new equipment, 
which has a life of four years and costs $1,000,000 has to be purchased. The revenue generated is estimated 
to be $500,000 per year. The total expenses associated with this precast concrete yard are estimated to 
be $120,000 per year. The profit tax rate is 25%.
a)	 Assuming straight line depreciation and ignoring salvage values, carry out a financial 
analysis for the company. (You are expected to create an income statement and derive a cash 
flow table for IRR calculation, and then to compute the IRR).
b)	 Carry out a new financial analysis and find the new IRR if the total capital of $1,000,000 is 
made up of $250,000 equity and $750,000 loan. The loan has to be paid back in three years 
(i.e. principal amortization of $250,000 per year) at an interest rate of 8% p.a.
c)	 Compare the internal rates of return in (a) and (b) above and give comments on them. If 
the NPV method at a discount rate of 8% p.a. (the borrowing interest rate) is used in (a) and 
(b), what results will be expected? And why?

S-Curve and Working Capital Financing  
of a Construction Project
8	 S-Curve and Working 
Capital Financing of a 
Construction Project
8.1	
Introduction 
This chapter discusses what an S-Curve is and how it is derived. In brief, an S-Curve is the graph/
curve showing the cumulative expenditure of a project (against time) spent by a contractor from the 
very beginning up to the very end of the project during construction. An S-Curve is usually considered 
together with another graph called cumulative interim payment graph, which shows the cumulative 
payment paid to the contractor by the owner/client of the project.
In the following sections, we will see how an S-Curve is derived. We will then see how a cumulative 
interim payment graph is drawn. By combining the two graphs, we will also discuss the maximum working 
capital required of the contractor for the project and the cost of its lock-up working capital, which, in 
other words, is the amount of interest, charged to the contractor for the lock-up working capital due to 
the project, if it is financed by a bank.
8.2	
S-Curve
A construction project always has a programme chart (or called bar chart or programme of work) such 
that each and every activity (or task) in the project is arranged to be carried out at proper time and in 
appropriate order. The programme/bar chart is usually first derived from a critical path analysis (the 
discussion of which is outside the scope of this book), and then an adjustment to the chart is made by 
experienced professionals in the construction company so that the programme of work is finalized in 
the most realistic manner.
The upper half of Fig. 8.1 (see next page) is an example of a bar chart for a small construction project. 
We can see a curve at the lower half of Fig. 8.1, and this curve is derived from the bar chart above it 
using the same time scale (or same x-axis). The cost of each task is given in the bar chart, and the curve 
below is drawn based on the cumulative cost (or expenditure). The shape of the curve looks like the letter 
S, and hence we usually call it an S-Curve. From experience, for almost all construction projects, their 
cumulative expenditure curves look like an S shape, quite similar to the one in Fig. 8.1. This is because at 
the beginning of a contract, works are catching up; at the middle, works are running smoothly; towards 
the end, works are slowing down.

8.3	
Cumulative Interim Payment Graph
For construction contracts, payments made by the owner/client to the contractor are on interim basis, 
that is, payments are made periodically. The length of the period depends on the type of construction 
contract employed. For a traditional unit rate contract, the interim payments are usually made on monthly 
basis. For a design-and-build lump sum contract, the interim payments are usually made based on mile-
stones achieved by the contractor that have been agreed with the client at the time of contract signing. 
In this case, the time periods between any two interim payments can be weeks or months. Supposing 
that the project in Fig. 8.1 is a traditional unit rate contract with a contract sum of $13,200,000 and that 
the interim payments are made by the client to the contractor on a monthly basis, Table 8.1 below shows 
the interim payments made by the client.

S-Curve and Working Capital Financing  
of a Construction Project
The cumulative interim payment graph is a step curve as shown in Fig. 8.2. It reflects the time and the 
amount of money the contractor receives from the client cumulatively from the very beginning to the 
very end of the contract. According to Fig. 8.1, the contract completion date is 5 months and 5 days, 
and the last few days are for “clean up and leave site”. In order to make the graph simple, we assume that 
the contract is substantially completed in 5 months. The maintenance period (or defect liability period) 
is assumed to be 3 months, and so the retention money (2.5% of the contract sum) can be released at 
the end of month 8.

S-Curve and Working Capital Financing  
of a Construction Project
From the combined graphs, we can find out the maximum working capital required of the contractor 
for this project, and the amount of interest charged to the contractor for the working capital if it is 
financed by a bank.
The maximum working capital needed by the contractor can be found from measuring the vertical 
differences between the two graphs at several points, and then these vertical differences are compared 
such that the largest difference is identified. This largest difference is the maximum working capital 
required. In the above example (Fig. 8.3), the difference immediately before the end of month 2 is 7,580 
(i.e. 7,580 – 0); the difference immediately before the end of month 3 is 6,750 (i.e. 9,750 – 3,000); the 
difference immediately before the end of month 4 is 3,170 (i.e. 11,170 – 8,000), and so on.
So, the largest vertical difference occurs immediately before the end of month 2. The maximum amount 
of working capital required is $7,580,000 for the project.

S-Curve and Working Capital Financing  
of a Construction Project
Apparently, the profit is $970,000 (i.e. 13,200,000 – $12,230,000). However, the contractor does not earn 
such an amount of profit but less than that. The reason is that the working capital has been locked up 
by the project, and the cost of the lock-up working capital must be deducted from $970,000, and what 
remains will then be the true profit. This is related to the so called opportunity cost, which means that if 
the working capital is not used here, it would have been used elsewhere to make money or gain profits. 
One way to find out this opportunity cost is to calculate the interest charged to the contractor as if the 
lock-up working capital is financed by a bank.
To calculate the interest charged (or the cost of the lock-up working capital), we have to find out area 
A and area B (see Fig. 8.3), the areas between the two curves. They are called finance areas. A finance 
area is positive if the S-Curve is above the cumulative interim payment curve, and vice versa. Therefore, 
in this case, finance area A is positive and finance area B is negative. The unit (or dimension) for these 
areas is $-month. The total (or net) finance area is equal to (area A – area B), calculated up to the end of 
month 8 only, which, if multiplied by the bank interest rate (in % per month, or % p.a. divided by 12), is 
the cost of the working capital. If the result of this multiplication is subtracted from $970,000 then the 
true profit can be known. The worked example in the next section (8.5) will illustrate this.

Table 8.2 – Expenditure each month for a 9-month contract
There is a mark-up of 8% to all unit rates contained in the contract document. The interim payments are 
made monthly. Due to the availability of trade credits, the contractor can delay paying his expenditures 
by an average of one month. Therefore, unlike Fig. 8.1, the S-Curve in this example starts at the end of 
month 1.
At the end of each month, quantity measurements are made, and the interim payment certified less 5% 
retention money is paid one month later. The accumulated retention money is released 6 months after the 
date of contract completion. The contract takes 9 months to complete and the contract sum is $47,520,000.
If the interest rate on money borrowing is 6% p.a., what are
a)	 the maximum amount of working capital required to execute the contract?
b)	 The cost of working capital for this project?
c)	 The contractor’s true profit gained from this project?

S-Curve and Working Capital Financing  
of a Construction Project
a)	 By inspection, the maximum vertical difference of the two curves occurs at the time immediately 
before month 6. Therefore, the maximum working capital required is $6.53m (i.e. 25.00 – 18.47).
b)	 From Fig.8.4, the positive finance area is found to be approximately 18.6 million$-month, 
and the negative finance area (up to the end of month 15) approximately 6.2 million$-month. 
Therefore, the total (or net) finance area is 12.4 million$-month.
Since the interest rate is 6% p.a. (i.e. 0.5% per month), the interest charges therefore is $0.062 
millon (i.e. 12.4 × 0.5%), or $62,000. This $62,000 is also called the cost of working capital for 
this project.
c)	 The contractor’s true profit gained from this project
= ($47,520,000 – $44,000,000) – $62,000
= $3,458,000
which is about 7.3% of the contract sum.

Calculate the cost to the contractor of borrowing the working capital necessary to finance the project if 
the annual rate of interest he has to pay is 12%.
Question 2
The expenditure per month for a small-medium scale building project scheduled for 5 months are given 
below. The mark-up is 5%. The retention money of the billed cost is 10% if the cumulative payment is less 
than half of the total value of work (contract value) and then 0% thereafter. The retention money will be 
released at the end of month 6, one month after the completion of the contract. Payment is billed at the 
end of each month and received one month later by the contractor. The finance charge is 1% per month.

Interim measurements are made monthly and payments of the amount certified less 10% retention are 
paid the contractor one month later. 50% of the retention money is released one month after substantial 
completion (i.e. end of month 11, since completion is at end of month 10), and the other 50% retention 
is released 6 months later (the defect liability period is 6 months). 
However, the client desires to decrease his administration duties and proposes to the contractor that 
interim payments be made bi-monthly. The contractor wishes to know the financial implications of 
this proposal. In other words, he wants to know how much more he has to pay for the cost of the 
working capital.
Assuming the contractor can delay paying his expenditures by an average of one month due to the 
availability of trade credits, calculate the extra financial charge for borrowing the working capital if 
interest rate is at 9% p.a. and interim payments are made on a bi-monthly basis.
