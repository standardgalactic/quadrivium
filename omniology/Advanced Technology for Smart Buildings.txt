This book deals with the deployment of advanced technology in buildings. 
It’s meant to be informative and useful. It covers major control systems and 
attributes of a smart building. Smart buildings are distinguished by the use 
of advanced technology. Advanced technology can come in many forms 
and can be deployed in many ways. Some of the advanced technologies 
addressed in the book are proven to provide value and results, while oth­
ers are new to the marketplace and appear very promising. The conclusion 
is that advanced technology can improve building performance, provide 
superior operation of building systems, lower the cost of operations, reduce 
service orders and maintenance, deliver higher satisfaction to tenants and 
occupants, and generate greater financial returns for the building owner.
A smart building is consistent with the holistic principal that it’s the 
whole is greater than the sum of the parts. It’s not one system or attribute 
that makes a building smart, it’s a combination of systems and practices 
that comprise a total approach. This book provides a summary with details 
regarding the roles of different participants in the smart building technology 
implementation process, various control systems, practices such as enter­
prise data management or energy management as well as emergent tech­
nology like indoor positioning systems, eye tracking systems, and software 
analytic applications.
The primary focus in the application of advanced technology is ongo­
ing building operations. It’s estimated that 75–80% of a building’s lifecycle 
costs and duration is related to building operations. Whether it’s an existing 
building or new construction the building owner who is not turning over 
real estate quickly has to take a long term view of the building operations. 
Astute owners will make longer term investments in smart buildings sys­
tems, equipment and building attributes if they’re to be assured of positive 
results, value, and return on investment.
Introduction

xii 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
There has been constant innovation in building construction since the 
first building was built for purposes other than just personal shelter. In the 
19th and 20th centuries major innovations such as running water, sew­
age systems, concrete, construction cranes, power equipment, electricity, 
and advanced materials all had an enormous impact on buildings. Likewise 
modern elevators facilitated high rise buildings and denser urban cities. 
Today’s technology produces new materials and innovations as well. The 
impetus for these advancements is related to the global focus on energy 
and sustainability with a growing and dynamic marketplace of new en­
ergy products, services, and companies. Efficient geothermal heat pumps, 
coatings for windows, companies aggregating utility demand response, mi­
crogrids, direct current electrical infrastructure, and renewables, are some 
examples.
The other major driver of advanced technology in buildings is informa­
tion and communications technology (ICT). In many ways ICT is much broader 
than energy and sustainability because billions on the planet are now habit­
uated to ICT via smartphones, tablets, and computers in their daily routine. 
The eventual vision to be created from ubiquitous ICT devices is the Internet 
of Things where any sensors, devices, or software applications that can be 
connected will be connected. These networks will be things to things, peo­
ple to things, and people to people. ICT is a major underlying foundation of 
smart buildings, as well as smart cities.
The penetration of ICT into building control systems has started with 
typical building control system communications protocols such as BACnet, 
Lonworks, and Modbus already incorporating the transport of those proto­
cols over an IT network. Many traditional building systems such as video 
surveillance, access control, and other components now operate over an IT 
network. We also have the crossover of IT cabling standards for building au­
tomation systems, automation controllers for mechanical equipment using 
Ethernet or Wi-Fi, and power to devices provided by Power-over-Ethernet 
(POE), an IT creation. In addition, the building management systems are IT 
devices; computers and servers, operating systems, databases, software ap­
plications, and IP addresses.
The facility management industry is in its infancy using IT as part of 
managing a building. However, facility management has already seen value 
in advanced building management tools, enterprise data management, data 
analytics, software applications, and leveraging and incorporating ICT. With 
the initial positive results of incorporating ICT into building construction, 
we can expect increased utilization. The penetration of IT has created is­
sues organizationally; that is, how IT and Facility Management departments 
work together in their responsibilities to monitor and maintain building 
systems. Eventually new organizational structures will be created, such as 

Introduction

an umbrella department for IT and facility management, or embedding IT 
experts in facility management. 
Despite recent advancements we’re not close to the full potential of 
automation and advanced technology in improving and optimizing building 
performance. Increased automation  would not only improve a buildings’ 
performance, but, will also support the facility management challenge to 
manage increasingly complex buildings at a time when the skills require­
dare constantly changing and in short supply. An example of where we are 
currently and where we need to go would be a software application like 
fault detection and diagnostics for HVAC systems, probably the most ef­
fective building analytic software application today, (still only half a loaf.) 
What if we had an application that could not only automatically detect 
system faults but also automatically repair the faults (perhaps something 
similar to an autopilot?)?
The autopilot for airplanes was born one hundred years ago. We’ve 
now developed driverless automobiles. Why can’t a building operate via 
auto pilot? Not only can buildings have autopilots but they should. Build­
ings are not airplanes or driverless cars, but, the idea of total automation 
should propel the control system and automation industry forward.
The roadmap to advanced, automated, and smart buildings involves 
several key issues the industry must address. One is the use of granular 
data. Granular data provides for more precision in properly managing spe­
cific spaces within a building, which can result in squeezing out the smallest 
amount of excess energy consumption and increase occupant satisfaction. 
Going granular will mean more sensors, tailored controls for individual 
spaces and a bit more investment which would ultimately lead to improved 
and less costly building operations. Another issue is policies and logic. For 
a building to be fully automated it requires the logic or policies of the au­
tomation use an array of data, data sources, and predetermined rules. As 
buildings become more complicated the decisions on their performance be­
come more complex as variables increase. The third issue is data mining and 
the use of data analytics applications. Analytics for the HVAC system has 
provided outstanding outcomes. We need to applythat template to other 
building systems. Such applications are based on rules of how the system 
should optimally operate, generally obtained from the original design docu­
ments, and monitoring key data points in real-time. For those systems that 
are not process based, applying analytics generally uses statistical monitor­
ing of key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor outliers. Accurately 
analyzing data in a building with enhanced levels of automation is crucial 
as that data will be the foundation of the logic and policies of the automa­
tion process. The remaining issue is the increased use and maintainenance 
of sensors. Yes, highly automated buildings will need additional sensors and

metering. With the market moving increasingly into developing informa­
tion based on data, we need to generate more data.
Smart buildings encompass many things, but, the primary goal is the 
use of building technology systems to enable enhanced services and the 
efficient operation of a building for the betterment of its occupants and 
building management. The main drivers of smart buildings are the positive 
financial impacts of integrated systems, energy conservation, greater sys­
tems functionality, and the continuing evolution of technology.

The Role of Owners and 
Architects in a Smart 
Building
One of the tried and true adages in the design 
and construction industry is that “there are no 
good projects without good owners”. The build­
ing owner is in the driver’s seat when it comes 
to the necessities in a newly constructed or ren­
ovated building. They have devised the project 
and will fund and pay for design and construc­
tion. As the eventual purchaser of the building, 
the owner obviously has significant input and a 
tremendous stake in a successful project.
A good owner is a leader who can clearly 
communicate, is  transparent in his decision-
making, listens to experts, and encourages col­
laboration and innovation among the designers 
and contractors. Typical considerations for the 
owner involve the purpose of the building or 
space, budget, time constraints, the complexity 
of design, physical conditions, economic condi­
tions, project sequencing, the project delivery 
method, as well as legal restrictions and envi­
ronmental impacts.

2 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
Prior to committing to a project, building owners will commission pre­
liminary studies to establish the project’s feasibility. The building owner (es­
pecially for a commercial building) wants to know if the idea is economical­
ly sound. Some of the variables that may be assessed are general economic 
conditions, specific situations of the area or community where the building 
is to be located, projected population growth, land prices, and current cost 
of construction. If the project is a commercial building or development, 
some of the initial studies will also be related to similar existing competing 
businesses  as well as an overall assessment of the business potential and 
climate.
The owner’s team usually consists of the owner (or a representative) 
a construction manager, possibly an existing facility manager or engineer, 
and major tenants or the overall facility user. The owner will select an ar­
chitect who will then assemble the design team. Two other project teams 
may be constituted as well. One would be the contractor team which in­
cludes the contractor or design-builder, the contractor’s Project Manager, 
Construction Manager, Superintendent and any subcontractors. A supplier 
team will also be established, involving representatives from equipment or 
material manufacturers, independent product representatives and suppliers 
or distributors.
There are a number of approaches to the overall delivery of a building 
project. Probably the most used and somewhat traditional method is design, 
bid, and build. In this process, the design of the building is completed, then 
bid out to qualified contractors; with the competitive bidding used to deter­
mine the lowest cost bidder. Government funded projects generally use this 
method. The downside here is that lowest cost doesn’t necessarily mean the 
best value for the owner.
A second approach is design, negotiate, and build. This is a more infor­
mal process where the contractor is involved in developing the costs and 
negotiating a contract to construct the project based on some stage of the 
design. In this case oftentimes the owner is looking for specific expertise, 
wants a notable architect or needs to expedite the schedule. 
Another approach is design-build. In the design-build delivery method 
the owner signs on with a single entity for the complete design and con­
struction of a project, providing design and construction under a single con­
tract with the owner. Generally the design and the construction companies 
enter into a joint venture or one entity subcontracts to the other. At some 
point after initial design the sole entity provides a guaranteed maximum 
price for construction. The potential benefits of this approach are greater 
collaboration between designers and the contactors with fewer change or­
ders or variances (since the designers and contractor are working as one 
team) and better adherence to the project schedule. This approach may save 

1.1  Design Teams 
3
time and money, as well as reduce the owner’s risk and potential litigation. 
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University found that design–build proj­
ects are generally delivered faster than those projects constructed under the 
design -bid-build process.
Often a building owner will hire a construction management company 
to manage the project from conception to completion in order to supple­
ment the owner’s staff and role. A construction management company will 
either advise the owner or act as a contractor. When acting as a contrac­
tor, they are referred to as construction management at-risk. Typically the 
building owner will bring in the construction management company prior 
to completion of the design and then incorporate the architect and construc­
tion management company into one entity or contract. Once contracted the 
construction management and the architect design teams review and evalu­
ate the project, eventually coming up with a guaranteed maximum price. 
There are architectural and engineering firms that can perform construction 
management at risk as well. The benefits to this approach are enhanced 
coordination with the design team and contractors, better cohesion in the 
project team and reduced risk.
These different approaches to project delivery are vitally important be­
cause they define roles, legal responsibilities and risks, and profoundly im­
pact the schedule, costs, and quality of the building.
1.1  Design Teams
The lead architect is typically the main interface with the building owner. 
It’s the architect that develops the owner’s facility program and assembles a 
design team, both of which are critical to the overall success of the project. 
With such a prominent role the architect heavily influences just how smart 
the building will be. The design team’s basic responsibility is to transform 
the owner’s vision and facility program into a detailed design. The team

determines the design requirements, specifies and draws up the project, 
produces the construction documents and eventually administers the con­
struction contract.
For a smart building it’s critical to select design team members that are 
open minded, innovative, technologically savvy, and experienced. If out 
of habit engineers and designers just select old legacy designs they simply 
short change the owner. Due to the influence of energy and sustainability 
concerns, as well as the use and penetration of IT into building systems 
most designers have had some experience with advanced technology and 
understand the concept of smart buildings. Architects should obviously also 
be experienced dealing with buildings becoming increasingly complex; re­
sulting in additional building systems, potential operational challenges for 
the owner, and design teams  growing as representatives of various. For 
example, if you’re trying to deploy solar panels, wind turbines, or a water 
reclamation system you’re likely to bring in several different specialists to 
represent the latest in technology and design.
1.2  Facility Programming
The initial phase of a project is Project Conception or Facility Programming 
and is sometimes referred to as visioning meetings to lay out how the own­
er’s requirements and objectives can be transformed into a clear or detailed 
concept or model. Such sessions may address current pain points, review 
emerging technology and innovations, and evaluate  what other building 
owners have experienced.
The development of a facility program will be led by the architect in col­
laboration with specialized facility programmers, engineers, consultants, fa­
cility managers, contractors and manufacturers. It’s a creative iterative pro­
cess which teases out the owner’s real objectives, values, and preferences, 
and identifies the needs and considerations related to aesthetics, econom­
ics, regulatory issues, energy, sustainability, and functionality. The result is 
the owner’s unique facility plan which forms the foundation of the design 
and construction. (For more on programming see the classic book “Problem 
Seeking” by HOK, an architectural programming primer).
During this early programming activity the discussion of a smart build­
ing, automation, advanced technology, system integration, emerging tech­
nology, tenant amenities, building management systems, and analytic 
software applications takes place. Facilitating such a discussion requires 
participants able to talk about emerging technologies, results of such de­
ployments at other projects, as well as the financial and operational ben­
efits. Many times site visits to projects that include smart building attributes 
are educational for owners and their design team. The goal of the project 

1.2  Facility Programming 
5
conception meeting should be an openness to innovation and a focus on the 
facility lifecycle and building performance.
Some potential obstacles during project conception include designers 
or participants that continue to provide legacy designed systems; designers 
that have a specification for a system and keep repeatedly using an aged 
specification. While part of the motivation of designers may simply be their 
familiarity and positive experience with specific equipment or manufactur­
ers, there is an incentive to reuse specifications and merely change the cli­
ent name because it takes much less time.  
Without focus on the potential use of advanced technology, options for 
system integration, and consideration of emerging technology and success­
ful deployment of smart building goals in other buildings, it will not become 
an integral part of the building program. When the idea of a smart building 
becomes an afterthought, possibly identified later in the design process, its 
consideration may be disruptive and potential benefits diminished because 
of existing design decisions and concerns.
There are prominent features of the facility program that will be man­
dated by government regulations. There will be attributes that will be 
influenced by third-parties, the most obvious being a green certification 
program. Assuming the owner is seeking such certification, the guidelines 
provide necessary benchmarks and parameters for the design, construction, 
and operation of buildings likely to be in the facility program. Similar to 
green certification is the Smart Buildings Institute (SBI) and other orga­
nizations’ certifications which focus on advanced technology, system and 
data integration and building operations, thus providing a framework and 
detailed properties for a smart building. 
So one role for architects, perhaps their most important role in a smart 
building, is simply putting advanced technology and smart building opera­
tions on the agenda, then explaining the technology and economics to the 
owner and incorporating the main tenets of this approach in the overall 
facility program.
Surely architects understand that the control, monitoring, and building 
automation systems are essential components in the smart building. These 
systems are the dynamic features or facets of the building; the nervous sys­
tem allowing for timely or real-time adjustments in the building’s envi­
ronment as well as optimal operational performance related to life safety, 
comfort, security, energy and an overall healthy atmosphere. 
Architects must also understand that it’s not just control systems that 
make up a smart building. The fixed attributes of the building such as the 
initial siting, the structure, envelope, windows, interior layout, materials, 
etc. also play a major role in how smart the building is and how well the 
building will operate. The best building control systems cannot compensate 

6 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
for the worst building construction and layout; in the same way, the best 
structure cannot overcome the worst building control systems. Both are 
critical in creating a smart and well-designed building. What follows are 
some of the functions and responsibilities of the architect and how they play 
a crucial role in designing, constructing, and operating a smart building.
1.3  Siting the Building
Architects frequently help the building owner with the process of select­
ing and acquiring the building’s site for new construction, or in existing 
buildings assessing current conditions and updating a survey. Why is the 
site selection process so important to being a smart building? Because it is 
a long term, 40 to 100 year decision. The specifics of a site, the topography, 
climate, and available public utilities will affect the design and construction 
of the building, possibly incorporating specialized building systems such as 
seismic, tilt, corrosion, and ground pressure monitoring. Also, the general 
area surrounding the specific site is critical; proximity to transportation in­
frastructure, to other businesses, schools, and skilled labor pools may be 
important to the long term success of the building.
1.4  Materials
The architect and the design team will select the materials used in the build­
ing. These decisions are often a balancing act between constructability, aes­
thetics, durability, regulations and affordability. These considerations are 
important because materials deteriorate and wear out. The unpleasant re­
sult may be condensation, corrosion, stains, moisture retention, bending, 
rot, fungus, and a host of other negative properties. Materials are critical 
because they will affect the ongoing cost and ease of maintenance and op­
erations, requiring servicing, cleaning, repairing or replacing. The selection 
of materials should focus on the long term use factoring in the cost of the 
materials as well as the minimization of maintenance.
Today’s building materials must also be sustainable; that is, materials ob­
tained from renewable, recycled, or replaceable sources. Products must be 
analyzed on a lifecycle basis, taking into account the environmental impacts 
of extracting the resources for the product, the manufacturing process, the 
materials transport and considering any impacts on material installers or 
building occupants. Guidelines for selection of materials are available from 
USGBC, the AIA’s environmental resource guide and the environmental 
lifecycle assessment specified in ISO 1400 standards

1.5  Coordination 
7
1.5  Coordination
Architects are generally tasked with coordinating the information and work 
of the design team members. Later in the construction phase a construction 
manager may coordinate the work of the contractors. Coordination of de­
sign and construction is especially essential when building control systems 
are being integrated, a very critical element of a smart building. It’s not 
enough to simply state in a specification that system A has to be integrated 
to System B; such pronouncements are too vague, don’t identify and detail 
the responsibility of each party and oftentimes can result in finger-point­
ing and delays. As the design team leader, the architect should endorse a 
compliance statement for system integration responsibilities that each of 
the designers and engineers can acknowledge and insert in their particular 
specification  that would cover the designers as well as the contractors. The 
statement may address standards for communications protocols, data for­
mat, submission of drawings and data points, responsibilities for any hard­
ware, timing of the integration, the contractors’ role in commissioning, etc.
1.6  The Handoff to Operations
As leader of the design team, the architect along with the contractors have 
responsibilities for the handoff from construction to operations. The design 
specifications must address important elements of the transition: startup 
procedures, closeout requirements, operation and maintenance data, pre­
ventative maintenance instructions, and facility operation procedures. A 
poor transition can mean the building launch and operations get off to a 
bad start, never fully recover or only catch-up after considerable cost, effort, 
and angst.
Studies have identified significant inefficiencies in the capital facilities 
marketplace primarily related to the lack of exchange of data. The inef­
ficiencies were estimated to be in the billions of dollars. More interesting 
was the fact that two-thirds of that cost are borne by owners and operators, 
primarily during ongoing facility operation and maintenance. Other stud­
ies have been done regarding the use of Building Information Modeling 
(BIM), a tool for design, construction, and exchange of data primarily used 
in design and construction fabrication but very little in building operations. 
The point is that the handoff from construction completion to operations 
is often inadequate, setting up suboptimal operations from the start. Better 
handoffs prescribe that we embed operations and maintenance into every 
aspect of design and construction.

Measuring the 
Performance of a 
Building
With increased global awareness of energy con­
sumption and sustainability we tend to mea­
sure the performance of a building based on 
its energy consumption, comparing its energy 
consumption against some base minimum en­
ergy performance such as the ASHRA E/IESNA 
Standard 90.1. The larger the improvement 
over the base energy performance the higher 
the building is performing. If a new building 
has exceeded the estimated base performance 
by 42% or an existing building by 35% (LEED 
criteria for optimizing energy performance) 
they have attained the highest level of building 
performance. But, what if this existing building 
has exceeded the base energy performance by 
35% but is unsafe, unprofitable, or is not satis­
fying it occupants? Is it still a high performance 
building?
Energy consumption and sustainability are 
critical in buildings, but, the view that only en­
ergy defines a building’s performance is myopic. 

10 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
The fact is that most buildings are too complex to be evaluated on energy 
consumption alone. If you were shopping for an automobile would you 
base your buying decision solely on miles-per-gallon or kilometers-per-liter 
of gasoline? If so we’d all be driving single-seat cars with 4-cycle engines. 
Building performance needs to be defined more broadly, more holistically. 
Aside from energy and sustainability we need to examine other factors of a 
building’s performance. While energy and sustainability are important unto 
themselves they also influence or affect other building performance factors, 
especially the financial aspect; that is, a large part of the motivation behind 
conservation, alternative energy sources, demand response, and so forth is 
to save money.
2.1  Financial Metrics
All buildings from modest houses to the tallest skyscrapers have financial 
aspects. Building is a business with defined industry sectors dealing with de­
sign, construction, management, and investments. Financial concerns cut 
across the lifecycle of a building; the construction or acquisition cost of the 
building, operating costs and the asset valuation of the building.
The financial metrics of a building can be almost endless, however there 
is published data for comparable commercial office or investment build­
ings a building owner can use to evaluate whether their building is above 
or below average financial metrics of similar buildings. For example, the 
Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) annually publishes 
the “Experience Exchange Report” which is based on data collected from 
thousands of buildings. The report allows users to examine expenses and 
income for similar type buildings in a common locale or submarket. The ex­
amination of basic balance and income reports for a building for profit and 
loss, increases or decreases to income, expenses and asset valuation can be 
used to judge financial performance.
Perhaps the major financial metric of a building is its overall value. For 
commercial income producing buildings the value of the building is gener­
ally tied to the income stream, mainly the net operating income (NOI).The 
NOI is potential gross income, less building operating expenses, vacancies, 
and collection losses. The value of the building can then be estimated or cal­
culated by using a revenue multiplier or capitalization rate of the building’s 
NOI. If the building has been operating for a while and has a history of NOI, 
another approach called discounted cash flow can be used. This technique 
uses discount rates to projected cash flows or income and calculates a pres­
ent value of the building. So income, expenses, occupancy, and rental rates 
all play a part of the valuation of the asset and determine the major metric 
of the financial performance of the building.

2.2  Security and Life Safety 
11
2.2  Security and Life Safety
Buildings must provide for the physical protection of its occupants and as­
sets. This includes protection from crime, vandalism, espionage, fire, ac­
cidents, and environmental elements. Typically a security threat assess­
ment of the building is conducted and then measures are identified and 
deployed. These may include deterring, detecting, delaying, mitigating or 
notifying of any attempt to injure, damage, modify, or remove an asset or 
person. These measures are put into place in three ways: the building sys­
tems, architectural countermeasures, and security operations. The building 
systems needed to provide security and life safety include fire alarm, video 
surveillance, access control and intrusion detection. Architectural counter­
measures include landscaping, doors, lighting, vehicular standoffs, and air 
intake (protecting building occupants from airborne chemical, biological, or 
radiological attacks). Building security operations include emergency pre­
paredness, training, policies, patrols, and so forth. So the security perfor­
mance of a building is based on regular threat assessments of the building, 
optimal operation and testing of the security related systems, prudent use 
of architectural countermeasures and a fully functional security operation. 
Security and life safety are affected by many different factors such as loca­
tion and age of the building, composition of the building occupants, climate, 
economic conditions, and education levels. Data on the number and type 
of security incidents in the building, trends in incidents, crime statistics for 
the area, and occupant surveys can be used to evaluate the security perfor­
mance of a building.
2.2.1  Operations and Maintenance
Efficient and effective operation and maintenance of a building is critical 
to its performance. It includes a variety of tasks: space planning, work or­
der processing, energy management, asset management, management re­
sponsiveness, systems performance, provision of specific space needs and 
Figure 2.1  Commercial building.

12 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
requirements, cleaning, training of staff, management of contractors, and 
so forth. Data from organizations such as BOMA and the International Fa­
cility Management Association (IFMA) allow building owners to compare 
the operations of their building with other comparable buildings to evalu­
ate building performance. For example, IFMA can provide information on 
gross and rentable square footage by industry type and facility use, square 
footage per occupant, janitorial costs and staffing, maintenance costs, roads 
and grounds costs, utility costs, life and safety costs, emergency and di­
saster planning costs, facility management information technology costs, 
employee amenities costs and best practices. So one way to evaluate the 
operational performance of a building is to gather operational data on the 
building and compare it to the operational metrics of similar buildings.
2.3  Productivity and Satisfaction of Building Occupants
Buildings enable their occupants to work, play, meet, shop, sleep, eat, social­
ize, educate, learn and a host of other activities. One performance criteria 
of a building should be how well it succeeds in enabling its occupants. This 
involves the comfort of the occupants, both physically and psychologically. 
The physical part is straightforward, involving thermal comfort, appropriate 
lighting and air distribution, workspace layouts and the technology systems 
to  to make the occupants’ tasks easier. These technology systems might 
include systems for digital signage, Wi-Fi, in-building cell phone coverage, 
asset location systems, audio video systems, and so forth. The physiological 
effect may relate to the building’s image, appearance, and aesthetics. 
Another measure of building performance is the productivity of build­
ing occupants. The largest effect on productivity over the last several de­
cades has been the penetration of IT technology and the Internet which 
reduces the time to access information, perform tasks and communicate. 
The workspace itself also plays a very important role. In a workplace sur­
vey conducted by a major architectural company, they found that effective 
workplace design directly correlated to improved business performance. 
The architect created a Workplace Performance Index that accounted for 
the criticality of the work mode, the time spent on the work and the ef­
fectiveness of the space for the particular work mode (work modes are ac­
tivities such as collaboration, focus and concentration, learning and social­
izing). This study accounted for the physical attributes of the space: layout, 
lighting, air, storage, furniture and access/privacy. What they found was 
that top-performing companies had workplaces with higher performance 
indices. They also found employees in workplaces with higher performance 
indices had greater job satisfaction, organizational commitment and were 
more engaged with their employer, all very positive for the businesses and 

2.3  Productivity and Satisfaction of Building Occupants 
13
organizations. The metrics and methodology of evaluating the satisfaction 
and productivity of building occupants have been developed and at the core 
it is a survey of people that use the building. The feedback from those peo­
ple, whether they are office workers, shoppers or teachers is valuable input 
to enhance building operations or improve the design of the next building.
Lighting in workplaces can affect our disposition, satisfaction and well­
being and is important to occupants comfort and productivity. Natural light 
is the best light for work but many commercial offices don’t have enough 
daylight. Lighting systems are used to complement or supplement daylight­
ing. The quality and quantity of such artificial lighting is key to comfort and 
productivity. Occupants also want control of the lighting in their workspace 
or desk, enough lighting to carry out their tasks, and the light to provide a 
pleasing ambience.
Many times new commercial buildings install generic lighting in tenant 
space prior to knowing who the tenant may be and the eventual tenant is 
left with general lighting rather than lighting specific to their needs. Issues 
such as lighting control, quality of the light, lighting too high or lighting at 
the wrong locations occur. Also, over time building space may change or be 
renovated and it’s at that point that lighting needs to be reconsidered.
In the past, offices in a commercial office building had four walls and 
a door. Over time many offices became desks in open plan spaces with the 
system furniture, where desks and cubicles were interlocked. The intent 
was primarily to facilitate employee interaction and collaboration. In some 
cases the objective was to reduce the space needed as well as cost. Many 
current office environments may have a few private offices and use flexible 
assignment of desks or offices via hoteling or hot-desking. Large open plan 
spaces can create acoustic issues; loss of privacy , and high noise levels, all 
of which cause distractions and decreased productivity. Studies show office 
workers biggest complaint is privacy, specifically overheard conversations.
To address acoustic issues in office spaces owners or tenants have imple­
mented several initiatives. One strategy is simply to separate incompatible 
office uses. That is, rooms meant for interaction, collaboration and a level of 
privacy, such as conference rooms, huddle rooms, focus rooms, etc. would 
be located  separate from open office space. The same would be true of sup­
port rooms, such as coffee bars or copier rooms.
If partitions are used in open office spaces, they should have a low noise 
reduction coefficient so the partition does not reflect speech when an oc­
cupant is seated at their desk. Another option is the use of sound absorbing 
ceilings and walls. Sound rated walls should be used for training rooms, 
conference rooms, and executive offices.
Another option to address acoustic issues in office space is the use of 
sound masking systems. These systems matured in the 1970s with the use 

14 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
of pick noise which could match the frequencies of human speech and im­
proved audibility. A sound masking system uses a series of loudspeakers 
installed in a predetermined grid pattern in the ceiling. There are meth­
ods to control and configure grid zones and output to optimize different 
spaces. The system basically distributes an engineered background sound 
throughout a work space. Independent studies have indicated that sound 
masking systems improve worker productivity, reduce stress, and increase 
job satisfaction
One of the most important factors affecting occupancy satisfaction is 
thermal comfort. If you were to ask a facility engineer what the most com­
mon service call is from a building occupant he would tell you it’s “hot and 
cold calls”. These calls are driven not only by the air temperature but also 
air velocity, relative humidity, and the temperature of the occupant’s im­
mediate surroundings. There are a number of other factors that can affect 
an occupant’s thermal comfort: their clothing, physical activity level, overall 
wellbeing, and food and drink.
While we focus on thermal comfort and health, thermal aspects of the 
building must also prevent mold and mildew as well as damage to the build­
ing’s materials. Thermal comfort in a commercial building must adhere to 
ASHRAE Standard 55 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Oc­
cupancy. This essentially defines thermal comfort in commercial buildings. 
This standard provides methods to determine thermal environmental con­
ditions (temperature, humidity, air speed, radiant effects) for buildings in 
which a significant proportion of the occupants (80%) will find acceptable 
comfort at a certain metabolic rate and clothing level.
Short of a quantitative whole building performance methodology, 
building owners will need to use comparable data, interviews, observa­
tions, surveys, tests, and demographic and financial data to evaluate other 
building performance factors. Note that there may be other measures to 
consider in a given building’s performance than the ones covered here and 
other methodologies to develop those performance metrics. One option of 
measuring performance is the use of Post Occupancy Evaluations (POE). 
These evaluations are primarily geared towards the occupants, but also in­
clude building staff, visitors, and others regarding how the building  meets 
user’s needs and suggestions for improving building performance. A POE 
usually involves both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The evaluation 
can be done as a focus group, via an interview or a questionnaire. Other 
information, such as energy consumption or lighting levels, air quality, or 
the number and responses to work orders can be taken into account. While 
POE obviously involves post occupancy, it can be used prior to the project 
to identify project success or set a baseline.

2.3  Productivity and Satisfaction of Building Occupants 
15
It is difficult, if not next to impossible, to quantify all the different as­
pects of a building environment on occupant productivity and satisfaction. 
However, a number of studies on a conducive building environment in­
dicate modest, measurable improvements in productivity which certainly 
result in significant financial gains.

Essential Attributes of a 
Smart Building
3.1  Cabling Infrastructure, Lighting 
Control Systems, and Facility 
Management Systems
Building owners, engineers, designers, contrac­
tors and facility management organizations are 
all aiming to build new buildings or renovate 
existing buildings identified as smart buildings. 
In general we think of smart buildings as be­
ing innovative, using advanced technology 
and materials, contributing to reduced energy 
usage, improving the building’s sustainability, 
and providing more efficient and effective op­
eration. But the high-level understanding of 
smart buildings doesn’t do justice to the con­
cept; a catch phrase doesn’t assist design teams 
or contractors, and it really doesn’t reflect the 
complexity of today’s buildings.
Generally, ethereal attributes describing 
smart buildings don’t help in defining a smart 
building so that the industry can have a com­
mon understanding of the concept. In contrast, 

18 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
look at green buildings or energy efficient or sustainable buildings; here 
you’ll find dozens of countries with environmental or energy building cer­
tifications with specific details on the requirements to be certified as a green 
building. Recall twenty years ago when the United States Green Building 
Council (USGBC) was formed, the idea was to provide the building industry 
with a system to define and measure green buildings. We need a similar ef­
fort for smart buildings to support the building industry. 
There have been various attempts to define a smart or intelligent build­
ing. They include the Asian Institute of Intelligent Buildings (AIIB), the 
Building Research Establishment Ltd., the Intelligent Building Society of 
Korea (IBSK), the Shanghai Construction Council (SCC), the Architecture 
and Building Research Institute, the Ministry of the Interior of Taiwan and 
finally the Smart Buildings Institute (SBI) in the USA. (http://www.smart­
buildingsinstitute.org/)
The SBI has certified buildings in the Americas as well as internation­
ally. The SBI certification structure is similar to LEED, having prerequisites, 
with other credit-based measures where applicants earn points during con­
struction and operation of the building. SBI also developed educational 
content that really isn’t available elsewhere, such as advanced automation, 
system integration, and so forth
Defining the attributes of a smart building cannot be done in few words; 
buildings are too complex and the features of a smart building too numer­
ous. The following sections will frame the major attributes of a smart build­
ing and provide details. 
3.1.1  Cabling Infrastructure
Cabling, cable pathways, and equipment rooms are important because in­
stalled cable tends to be in the building for 20-25 years. What is initially 
designed and installed is vitally important. Cable may seem mundane, but, 
with constant advancements in cable throughput, reductions in poten­
tial interference, and increased low voltage power over the telecom cable 
it means the long lifecycle requires the installation of the latest in cable 
technology.
The smart buildings approach is to maximize the use of structured cable 
plant for multiple building systems. A smart building will also supplement 
the wired infrastructure with the use of wireless systems. As IT continues 
to penetrate a building this infrastructure becomes increasing critical and a 
key attribute of a smart building. 

3.1  Cabling Infrastructure, Lighting Control Systems 
19
3.1.2  Lighting Control Systems
Lighting affects several important aspects of a building. There is the aes­
thetic impact it will have in the building and its spaces, resulting in how 
occupants will perceive and react to the built environment. There is the 
more practical and functional aspect of providing lighting to facilitate the 
work occupants undertake in and around a building. And finally, lighting 
consumes significant energy. 
A smart building entails a centralized lighting control system in all the 
building’s usable square footage. The system should provide a dimmable 
lighting strategy. It also should have a global and a zone light schedule and 
override capabilities.
3.1.3  Facility Management Tools
The operation of a facility represents the longest duration of the lifecycle of 
a building and the largest portion of the total lifecycle cost. The facility man­
agement responsibilities are wide-ranging and multidisciplinary; varying 
from responses to immediate alarms to regular maintenance work orders or 
long term capital planning. Given the fact that today’s buildings are increas­
ing more complex, the need for a smart building to have facility manage­
ment top of the line tools and processes to efficiently manage the facility 
becomes essential. The software facility management applications shape the 
administrative processes within facility management. They include: a work 
order system, a preventative and predictive maintenance application, space 
planning management, inventory control system, and asset management.
BIM Integration
Building Information Modeling is a significant data management tool for 
new construction. The data and modeling generated in the use of BIM 
should be exported in the facility management systems.
3.2  System Integration, Audio-Visual Systems, and Water
3.2.1  System Integration
Integration functionally links two building systems to provide functionality 
that neither system could by itself. The best example of this process is the 
integration that takes place with the fire alarm system. The fire alarm trig­
gers the HVAC system to control smoke and ventilation, the access control 
system to provide egress for occupant evacuation, and the elevator cabs are 

20 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
automatically recalled to a facility’s predetermined floor of egress. Without 
the automated systems’ integration each of these components would have 
to be separately and manually adjusted. The theory is  that the whole is 
greater than the sum of the parts. Another reason to integrate systems is 
to combine the system data. Rather than simply looking at data from one 
building system a database with data from multiple systems is created so 
that holistic data can be analyzed, correlated, and insightful building met­
rics can be developed. 
3.2.2  Audio-Visual Systems
Many times the deployment of audio visual systems are undervalued and 
marginalized. However,  AV systems can affect tenant satisfaction, energy 
usage and operations, and are an important part of a building. The AV in­
dustry is interesting because contractors, manufacturers, AV managers, and 
technicians have hands-on experience with system integration, albeit at a 
different point than the integration issues building owners and facility man­
agers generally deal with. Also they have experience with the design and 
construction process. Typical AV integration may include IT, shading, se­
curity, and other building systems. There are several AV facets and options 
that are needed to make a building smarter:
3.2.3  Paging and Messaging Systems
A building’s paging and messaging systems may be thought of as secondary 
systems, but often they are a part of life safety. Paging is also used in many 
educational,  large healthcare, corporate and government buildings such as 
airports, and convention centers. Legacy paging systems were typically a 
separate piece of equipment connected to a PBX (something which is now 
long gone). Current systems are built on VOIP-type technology and IP end 
devices, including IP speakers. The network connectivity allows authorized 
users to broadcast audio simultaneously to speakers and IP telephones. 
Some systems have the capability to concurrently send a multicast audio 
stream and text messages that can be delivered to not only paging speakers 
and IP telephones but also PCs, tablets, and smartphones.
Some messages could include information on weather conditions or 
event reminders for organizations. More importantly, the messaging and 
notification can be used for emergency situations. The notification capabil­
ity of the system can provide real-time communications within a building 
or across a campus regarding an emergency situation thus significantly im­
proving life safety and security. 

3.3  Occupant Satisfaction, Fire Alarm, Networks and Security 
21
Digital Signage
Digital signage is a very compelling technology. The medium has sticki­
ness—few people will not at the very least, glance at or pay attention to 
a plasma or LCD display. It’s a communication system that’s effective, im­
mediate, and dynamic. It can be utilized in a variety of building types. Digi­
tal signage can be used to inform, entertain, communicate, advertise, and 
enhance the experience one has within a building. Different building types 
will have various uses for digital signage.
3.2.4  Water
Water is a critically important resource; maybe our most precious resource. 
Where alternatives exist for energy sources there are no alternatives to wa­
ter. If you don’t think water is important consider that people can survive 
longer without food and certainly without energy than they can without 
water; not surprising considering that two thirds of the human body by 
weight is composed of water. Water also has a direct connection to energy 
use. The critical nature of water is recognized in green building programs 
throughout the world.
3.3  Occupant Satisfaction, Fire Alarm, Networks and Security
3.3.1  Occupant Satisfaction
Buildings enable their occupants to work, play, meet, shop, sleep, eat, so­
cialize, educate, learn and a host of other activities. This involves their com­
fort, both physically and psychologically. Considerations such as  thermal 
comfort, appropriate lighting for the occupants’ activity, control of lighting 
and air distribution,  workspace layouts and the technology systems make 
it easier for the occupants to complete their tasks. The physiological effect 
may relate to the building’s image, appearance, and aesthetics. 
3.3.2  Fire Alarm
The primary job of the fire alarm system is to warn building occupants of a 
fire so that they can safely evacuate the premises. The fire alarm system is 
one main component of a larger fire protection system. True fire protection 
encompasses mechanical systems, electrical systems, structural attributes, 
and architectural aspects such as means of egress. These may include: fire 
sprinklers that discharge water when a fire has been detected or a prede­
termined temperature has been exceeded. The structural and architectural 
aspects of the building play a part in fire protection. The building must be 

22 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
fire-rated and have a fire resistant structure, as well as intuitive means of 
egress for occupants.
3.3.3  Network and Security
The building automation industry now has legitimate and reasonable con­
cerns regarding the security of building control systems, especially in smart 
buildings where advanced technology is deployed. This apprehension is 
amplified in newer buildings because of increased penetration of IT infra­
structure in building control systems. The overarching security concern is 
primarily about network security and less about physical security, although 
the two are certainly related. 
3.4  Electrical, Building Metering, and Video Surveillance 
Systems
3.4.1  Electrical
Without stable, high quality electricity our world would be radically and 
negatively impacted. We rely on safe and reliable electricity from our utili­
ties and within our buildings. 
A smart building has an electrical infrastructure that is dependable, 
adaptable, and cost-effective to maintain and operate. In addition to the 
electrical infrastructure building owners also must have a relationship with 
their supplier for two-way communication with the utility grid, demand 
response notifications, and optimal rate structures. Building owners may 
address the use of renewable sources or a microgrid for a building or de­
velopment that can locally generate electricity. A prerequisite for electri­
cal distribution is a power monitoring control system, able to examine the 
quantity and quality of power being supplied and consumed. Measurement 
produces data, and data is the underpinning or basis of control and manage­
ment. Electrical backup capabilities are also a required for smart buildings, 
especially critical facilities such as healthcare and data centers. 
3.4.2  Building Metering
Smart meters gather data in real-time  and provide not only usage data but 
also information on outages, malfunctions, and quality. There are generally 
two types of power meters for buildings. One is for monitoring and measur­
ing power to the whole building. The second type is a submeter, meant to 
measure usage for specific spaces, tenants or electrical circuits.
There is also interest water monitoring and management systems con­
sisting of water meters, sensor-operator water fixtures such as faucets,

23
urinals, water closets, occupancy sensors, automated ball valves and water 
valves. 
3.4.3  Video Surveillance Systems
It’s a given that any sizable building will have a video surveillance system. 
Video surveillance systems, also known as closed-circuit television systems 
(CCTV), are one part of a facility’s larger security and life safety plan. The 
larger plan may include physical and operational aspects of security as well 
as other security or life safety systems, such as access control and intrusion 
detection. Much like the broader electronics marketplace, the technology 
for video surveillance has changed from legacy analog to digital technology.
IP-Based video surveillance leverages existing IT infrastructure and 
contributes to lower cost of installation. 
Cameras can detect smoke or fire, identify specific individuals, detect 
motion, determine if objects have been moved and provide occupancy data 
including the actual number of people in a given space. Generally, if you 
can develop a pixel template of the event or condition you are trying to 
track, the video analytic software can detect the event or condition. 
The array of consistent analytic tools related to video cameras are ex­
tensive. They include:

cation, Data Infrastructure and HVAC, Access Control and 
Sustainability 
3.5.1  Advanced Building Management Systems
The driver in advanced building management systems is the increasing 
complexity of buildings. From an equipment or hardware perspective we 
now have buildings with energy and sustainability systems which are rela­
tively new for buildings, systems that even five years ago were not com­
monplace. These include systems such as rain water harvesting, exterior 
shading, water reclamation, electric switchable glass, sun tracking systems, 
and so forth. Maintaining and optimizing each of these new systems is a 

24 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
challenge, further burdening and challenging facility management. The 
other aspect of increased complexity is related to management decisions 
regarding building operations. Many of these decisions now involve several 
variables, with some situations requiring real-time decisions, for example a 
demand response event from a utility requiring immediate action.
The shortcomings of the typical legacy BMS is quite a long list, including 
limited integration capabilities, inadequate and elementary analytic tools, 
proprietary programming languages, a dearth of software applications, and 
legacy user interfaces. 
A smart building will have an advanced building management system 
with an open programming language where all integration is accomplished 
via software. It requires middleware to normalize and standardize all data 
from subsystems into an open, standardized database using SOAP/XML or 
other computer software exchange architecture. The database would in­
clude all physical, virtual and calculated points. The user interface to the 
advanced systems include displays and dashboards completely configurable 
and customizable by users, with access via a browser. The system would be 
capable of data exchange with information in enterprise and business level 
software, providing a suite of software applications such as energy manage­
ment, building performance analytics, alarm management, and automatic 
fault detection and diagnosis.
3.5.2  Communication and Data Infrastructure
The method of communication and data exchange within and between 
building systems is vital. It is a foundation that will determine the difficulty 
or ease of integrating system functionality and data. Smart buildings shun 
proprietary protocols in favor of standard open communications protocols 
based on the ASHRAE BACnet I/P, Lonworks, OPC DA, Modbus TCP, oBIX, 
XML, SOAP and SNMP standards of data exchange or similar open standard 
protocols. Many building products now incorporate open protocols, some 
going through a process that verifies or certifies their adherence to the pro­
tocol standard. 
The network architecture of building systems should take into account 
the minimum speeds for serial buses, maximum size in points and devices 
per serial bus, maximum number of serial buses per network controller, 
and the use of native open-protocol controllers versus gateways in existing 
buildings. 
The adherence to standard open protocols and detailed network design 
extends not only to building control systems but also to facility manage­
ment systems, business systems, and IT systems in the use of standard data­
base structures such as SQL or ODBC, Oracle or DB2.

3.5  Advanced Building Management Systems 
25
3.5.3  HVAC
In many ways, HVAC equipment is the most complex building system, with 
numerous components arranged to produce heating, cooling and ventila­
tion through the principals of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and heat 
transfer.
The HVAC system not only makes the building comfortable and healthy 
for its occupants, it manages a substantial portion of the energy consumed, 
as well as plays a critical role in life safety. In maintaining the building’s air 
quality the HVAC system must respond to a variety of conditions inside and 
outside the building (including weather, time of day, different types of spac­
es within a building and building occupancy) and do so while optimizing its 
operation and related energy usage. Given the variety of conditions and the 
potential complexity of a substantial HVAC system this necessitates exten­
sive automation and system integration. For example, in a smart building 
we expect the HVAC system to automatically sequence chillers, pumps, and 
boilers, as well as automatically rotate parallel chillers, pumps, and boilers 
by accumulated run-time. The HVAC system should also perform an opti­
mal start calculation based upon real occupancy history instead of estimated 
start times.
Control of the HVAC system for occasional use facilities such as meet­
ing rooms, conference rooms, and cafeterias  is also important in reducing 
unnecessary energy consumption. HVAC for those spaces needs to be inte­
grated into another system which can supply data to the HVAC system re­
garding use or occupancy. These include data from an access control system, 
video surveillance, a people counter system, lighting control, a RTLS/RFID 
system or more likely, occupancy sensors.
The HVAC system also plays a substantial role in a demand response 
events as well as demand limiting. Data from the utility or a power manage­
ment system communicated to a BMS and chiller controls can be used to 
adjust the electric demand of the HVAC system to an acceptable level.
3.5.4  Access Control System
Access control systems are a critical component in smart buildings as secu­
rity has become more important. The access control system is also essential 
for life safety and is interfaced to the fire alarm system to facilitate building 
egress during life safety evacuations. Access control systems must interface 
or integrate with several other smart building systems (video surveillance, 
HVAC, and others) as well as share data with business systems, such as hu­
man resources, time, and attendance. 
In a smart building, one electronic access control system for non-public 
areas should be deployed. Within secured areas the access control system 

26 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
would provide two levels of authentication. The system should support of­
fline operation to allow doors to function if network connectivity is lost. 
The access control system should be supplemented by an intrusion detec­
tion system at potential unauthorized entrances, such as windows. While 
access cards are generally used in many systems, biometric authentication 
may be utilized for an additional degree of security.
The access control system should be configured to maximize security. 
For example, its use of vertical transport systems (elevators) can provide 
selective access to floors based on occupant identity, as well as spaces such 
as parking and garages.
Security levels would be determined by individual, floor, or areas, and 
access privileges can be changed in response to building occupancy states 
(i.e. time of day). An access control system can also generate anonymous 
occupancy statistics for building spaces and zones. Such data can be used to 
correlate occupancy to other building systems such as energy consumption 
or lighting schedule. One of the largest problems with access control sys­
tems can be piggybacking and tailgating. Piggybacking happens when some­
one with legitimate access to a building allows someone without access to 
the building to come in with them. Tailgating involves taking advantage of 
someone who legitimately has access to the building, where a trespasser 
enters the building with a person (or group of people) without their knowl­
edge. One way to prevent piggybacking and tailgating is a mantrap shield 
that use sensors to ensure that only one person is entering the building 
using one set of credentials. Mantrap shields can also be configured with 
separate compartments so that if more than one person is sensed passing 
through the first door, the second door will remain locked. 
3.5.5  Sustainability and Innovation
Green buildings and smart buildings have different focuses but they also 
overlap. A primary component of a smart building is energy efficiency and 
sustainability, acknowledged by an industry certification such as LEED, and 
a clear policy and plan for energy management by the building owner. This 
plan may involve delegation of responsibility for energy consumption, as 
well as tracking, monitoring, and reporting systems for energy consump­
tion. In addition, building owners would participate in demand response 
and automated load shedding in cooperation with the utility company
Innovation is integral to a smart building. Innovation by the building 
owner, designer, contractor or manufacturer that can demonstrate benefits, 
value and exceptional performance should be recognized and incorporated 
into the methods or criteria for deploying a smart building.

Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal
                                                        —Albert Einstein 
The smartest parts of a building, its systems and materials, are driven by 
innovation and technology. They may have focus on long term building 
operations and performance, but, some are simply major game changers. 
Inventions such as elevators, construction cranes, and power tools are ex­
amples of equipment that changed the way buildings are designed and con­
structed. While electricity is not a human invention, the commercialization 
of electricity and its use in buildings was a milestone. One of the latest game 
changers has to be Building Information Modeling (BIM); designing, fabri­
cating, implementing and managing construction in multiple dimensions. 
 The backdrop for buildings and related automation is now tied to the 
innovative information and communications technology for building sys­
tems, building design, construction, operations and building occupants. 
Many astute building owners embrace technology and innovation. How­
ever, it can be a challenge and uncomfortable for some building owners, 
architects, engineers, and facility managers to innovate and change. It’s al­
ways easier to keep doing what you’ve been doing than to put forth the ef­
fort to do something different. Some may choose not to innovate based on 
the rationale that they can mitigate risk. Nevertheless the smart designers 
and engineers will examine innovations, assess risk, and gauge the ultimate 
value for building owners, as well as include new ideas, systems and prod­
ucts in discussions of a project concept. 
The broader environment for smart buildings is related to: (a) the habit­
uation of the global society to communications and information technology, 
and (b) the emergence and convergence of three related markets: smart 
buildings, smart cities, and the Internet of Things. 
The morphing of these different markets has happened very quickly 
and almost without any measured intent of the building, city, and IoT in­
dustries. What’s driving the transformation is the commonality among the 
three markets. Each of these entities are pushing the envelope to advance 
the experience and performance for building occupants, citizens and indi­
viduals, using technology as the enabler. The tools being utilized to provide 
that experience are similar. They include system integration, the acquisition 
and management of data, the analysis of data, the creation of new software 
applications, the development of performance metrics, and the visualiza­
tion of the data tailored to the entity or individual consuming the data. 

28 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
3.6.1  Smart Buildings and Cities 
The best and most obvious example of these markets evolving is smart 
buildings and smart cities. The catalyst for smart cities is population growth, 
with the population becoming more urbanized. Predictions are that seventy 
percent of the world’s population will be in cities by 2050. Urbanization 
spawns buildings and requires building owners and the city community to 
take responsibilities for sustainability, energy management, and livability. 
Here’s a short list of mutual issues for cities and smart buildings:

 Energy: Cities need secured and adequate energy supplies. Energy also 
affects the environment of a city and the cost of living. The city’s utility 
grid needs to communicate with the cities’ buildings, and the power 
grid. Individual buildings should acquire, analyze, and share energy 
data. Major buildings and large developments should be encouraged to 
develop microgrids with a variety of energy sources to improve reliabil­
ity, stability, and efficiency. Communication between the grid and the 
buildings allows for demand response, but, also sets up the microgrids 
as energy sources especially when the grid’s capacity is being taxed. 

 Water Distribution Systems: Humans can live without energy; but they 
can’t without water. Water is our most precious resource so cities as 
well as building owners need to undertake water conservation and 
waste water treatment. Much like energy monitoring, real-time moni­
toring and management of water should be required, not only for con­
sumption metrics, but also for leak detection. 

 Transportation: Traffic congestion and a lack of alternative transpor­
tation modes are major negatives when it comes to a city’s livability 
and its economy. Traffic oftentimes is the top complaint citizens have 
about their city. Cities need to deploy intelligent traffic systems such as 
traffic signal control systems, license plate recognition, and real-time 
data from other systems to utilize predictive analytics in reducing travel 
times. However, it is critical that the road system be supplemented by 
alternative modes of transportation. Large developments and buildings 
are typically part of the transportation plan, with some cities requiring 
building owners to have a transportation management program and a 
plan for trip reductions in order to reduce traffic and parking loads. 

 Public Safety: Safety and security is key to a city and its buildings. For 
the city it involves multiple agencies and organizations; police, fire, 
emergency, courts, neighborhood groups, and more. The city is in a 
position to collect intelligence, use predictive data analytics, commu­
nications and situational awareness to help in predicting crime areas. 

3.6  The Constantly Evolving Smart Building 
29
Building owners are generally proactive and do a security risk assess­
ment which involves  systems to protect building occupants, resources, 
the building structure, and continuity of operations. While a city and a 
building owner have the same security and safety goals, their scope is 
different but complimentary. 

 Digital Services: Cities as well as buildings need to deploy electronic and 
internet services. This may be smartphone apps for finding your way in 
a building or a city, as well as interacting with a city official or a building 
manager electronically, essentially providing convenience. 
3.6.2  The Internet of Things and Smart Buildings 
The Internet of Things (or everything) is somewhat of a wild card. It seems 
to be a concept with little definition. The Internet of Things will basically 
connect everything to everything else using the internet, which will lead 
to an unprecedented  level of automation for a variety of fields. The fact 
that IoT a concept without boundaries may be a good thing and spawn new 
ideas. However, standards development may be the Achilles heel of the IoT. 
It may take some time and  may eventually result in multiple standards, in­
cluding proprietary ones from groups of commercial technology companies. 
This could delay the IoT market everyone is expecting. 
This level of connectivity could provide integration to enhance func­
tionality that none of the systems or devices could provide individually. 
Or it could simply acquire data from devices and analyze or mine the data 
in order to develop and gather information. This is  essentially what many 
astute facility management groups are already doing; integrating building 
systems to provide greater functionality and deploying analytic software 
applications to improve the performance of building systems. It’s difficult 
to see if IoT can add much for building owners who already are integrating 
and analyzing data. 
If you examine the commercial companies involved in the various 
associations or consortiums attempting to create the IoT standard, all are 
technology companies; chip manufacturers, and hardware, telecom, and 
software vendors. It would seem that home automation, wearable technol­
ogy and IT will be significant sectors of the IoT given the involvement of IT 
companies. 
What effect or influence will the IoT really have on building manage­
ment? If the initial products are related to wearable technology and home 
automation there will not be much interest by facility managers unless a 
building is mixed use, in which some apartments or condominiums require 
home automation to be deployed. Facility management can and will deploy 

30 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
additional sensors if needed without thinking much about IoT. With the 
building automation industry’s long history of a handful of well-known 
global communication protocols and the excellent gateways and middle­
ware in the market, facility managers have the tools to take their buildings 
to a higher and more valuable level of building automation, with or without 
the IoT.
Numerous research companies and organizations are predicting sig­
nificant growth in the smart building market. One company, Markets and 
Markets, expects the global marketplace to grow at a stunning compounded 
annual rate of 35% over the next five years. While it’s difficult to compare 
market research because there are various definitions of what submarkets 
(smart homes, smart grid, etc.) make up the larger smart building market, 
most research in the smart building area indicates substantial growth world­
wide. Given that the general economic outlook for the global economy is 
relatively flat, or for modest growth at best, it’s impressive that smart build­
ings are such a rapidly growing segment, but, this is by no means a surprise.
There are several factors creating demand for smart buildings. One of 
the most potent is the results from building owners that have already de­
ployed smart building technology. These building owners have found re­
ductions in energy consumption, enhancements to operations, and a very 
attractive return on investment. Such examples and stories validate the ap­
proach, verify the likely results, and reduce the risk for other building own­
ers to plan to deploy the technologies. Another element driving the market 
for smart buildings is our global society’s habituation to real-time informa­
tion and communications technology; people not only accept cutting-edge 
technology as an integral part of our buildings but expect that their build­
ings will be smart.
An additional factor to consider is that while the marketplace is rapidly 
evolving, there are existing elements that comprise a smart building. These 
include system integration, advanced building management tools, exten­
sive automation and sensors, energy management, enterprise data manage­
ment, data analytics, software applications and the leveraging and incorpo­
ration of IT. It is this emerging clarity that can guide designers, contractors 
and manufacturers, as we complete the definition of a smart building by 
addressing HVAC, communication and data infrastructure, access control 
systems, advanced building management systems and sustainability.

4.1  Overview
Transformative periods in the building indus­
try occurred several times in the 20th century 
with the introduction of mechanisms such as 
plumbing, construction cranes, and elevators. 
Thirty years ago, just prior to the mass intro­
duction of personal computers for businesses, 
the level of technology in a building was mea­
ger. It consisted of the local regulated public 
telecommunications utility installing services in 
a building, a mechanical contractor installing a 
pneumatic control system for the heating, cool­
ing, and ventilation system, a fire alarm system, 
and maybe a dedicated word processing system. 
While we’ve come a long way since those days, 
we’re still in a very early stage of fully deploy­
ing and integrating sophisticated building tech­
nology systems.
In due course, buildings will become full of 
technology. Walls and ceilings will be embedded 
with sensors; every aspect of a building’s perfor­
mance will be metered and measured; software 
tools will be used to automatically optimize 
building systems without human intervention; 

32 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
real-time information on the building will be provided to occupants and 
building management relevant to their particular needs; buildings will be 
fully interactive with the power grid; cars will be efficiently parked via con­
veyers, and geo-spatial location systems will be deployed for every building 
asset. Facilitating this transformation is information technology.
4.2  Communications Protocols
There is an increasing role for information technology in our lives, includ­
ing building control systems and facility management. All major commu­
nications protocols used in building systems (BACnet, Modbus, Lonworks, 
etc.) now have a version for Internet Protocol (IP) or Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) that allow the BAS protocol to ride on an IT network. We 
now have building management systems; basically an IT device with a serv­
er, IT operating system, IP address, and IT database. Further evidence of the 
IT infiltration includes international standards for cabling related to build­
ing automation systems that are identical to that of IT, BAS controllers using 
Wi-Fi, and the current focus on data analytics for building system data. This 
IT infiltration has and will cause disruptions and adjustments between IT 
and Facility Management organizational roles.
4.2.1  Wireless Infrastructure
The use of wireless networks control systems in buildings has many advan­
tages. By eliminating the need for cable and related conduit the initial costs 
for deploying system sensors, meters, and control devices are reduced and 
installation time is shortened. Wireless is the ideal approach for retrofitting 
existing buildings where the lack of cable pathways is an impediment.
Figure 4.1   The use of information technology to design a building in 3D.

4.2  Communications Protocols 
33
The major difference between the performance of wired and wireless 
networks is network communication capacity or bandwidth. However, 
building systems field devices generally do not need much bandwidth and 
conduct their business at relatively low data rates. Another potential issue 
with wireless is that some wireless transceivers may use batteries which 
require regular replacement. The low data rates and the possibility of peri­
odic battery replacements are minor strikes against wireless compared to its 
flexibility, cost advantages, and reduced installation time. What follows are 
some of the choices for wireless networks for building control systems as 
well as some of the building devices that can be deployed wirelessly.
4.2.2  Wireless Network Types
There are wireless networks using licensed radio frequencies and unlicensed 
radio frequencies. There are wireless technologies such as Zigbee, EnOcean, 
Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, RFID, Insteon, Bluetooth, etc. The following is a snapshot of 
some of the major technologies:
4.2.2.1  Zigbee
Zigbee is a wireless technology standard (IEEE 802.15.4) which provides for 
low data rate networks. It uses unlicensed frequencies (900 MHz in the US, 
868 MHz in Europe, and 2.4 GHz worldwide) which are also available for 
cordless phones Wi-Fi, and other devices. The standard is aimed to address 
residential, building, and industrial control devices. It is specifically useful 
for sensors and control devices of building automation systems within a 
smart building where very small amounts of information or data are being 
transmitted. Zigbee also has uses in home automation, industrial automa­
tion, home entertainment systems, and smart meters. 
The maximum speed of Zigbee devices varies up to 192-250 Kbps (a 
measure of bandwidth, kilobits per second). The maximum distance varies 
between 20 and 50 meters. Zigbee has several advantages: (a) low power 
usage since the devices only require two AAA batteries, (b) wide support 
from more than 100 companies that support the standard (Motorola, Hon­
eywell, Samsung, Mitsubishi, and others), (c) mesh technology which al­
lows Zigbee, like Wi-Fi, to be configured in several topologies including a 
mesh topology allowing multiple transmission paths between the device 
and the recipient, and (d) system scalability where thousands of Zigbee de­
vices can deployed within a building.
4.2.2.2   EnOcean
EnOcean Alliance is a consortium of companies in North America and Eu­
rope that are developing and promoting self-powered wireless devices. The 

34 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
initial consortium formed in 2008, and includes Texas Instruments, Omnio, 
Sylvania, Masco, and MK Electric. The consortium claims the largest in­
stalled base of wireless building automation networks.
The main objective of this technology is to allow sensors and radio 
switches to operate without batteries reducing maintenance. To do this the 
technology uses energy harvesting which exploits slight changes in motion, 
pressure, light, temperature, or vibration to transform small energy fluctua­
tions into usable electrical energy. The devices transmit at 120 Kbits per sec­
ond, up to 300 meters with a data packet of 14 bytes. The transmission fre­
quency used for these devices is 868.3 MHz, an unlicensed radio frequency.
EnOcean GmbH, a spin-off company of Siemens, supplies the trans­
mitters, receivers, transceivers and energy converters to companies such as 
Distech Controls, Zumtobel, Omnio, Osram, Wieland Electric, Peha, Ther­
mokon, Wago, Herga and MK Electric, who then develop and manufacture 
products. While the products tend to focus on building automation they are 
also targeted for industrial automation and automotive markets.
EnOcean is based on an international standard, the International Elec­
trotechnical Commission (IEC) standard—ISO/IEC 14543-3-10—for wire­
less applications with ultra-low power consumption. They have created 
EnOcean Equipment Profiles (EEP) for EnOcean devices that ensure in­
teroperability of different end-products based on EnOcean technology; re­
sulting in equipment from one manufacturer being able to communicate 
with equipment of another manufacturer.
4.2.2.3  Z-Wave
Z-Wave is about wireless solutions for residential and light commercial ap­
plications. The Z-Wave Alliance is an open consortium of over 160 man­
ufacturers. Members include Cooper Wiring Devices, Danfoss, Fakro, In­
gersoll-Rand, Intermatic, Leviton, Universal Electronics, Wayne-Dalton, 
Z-Wave and Zensys.
At the core is the Z-Wave protocol, developed by Zensys, a division of 
Sigma Designs. Sigma Designs provides embedded networking software and 
Z-Wave chip solutions for manufacturers and OEMs. The Z-Wave protocol 
stack is embedded in the chips, and flash memory is available application 
software. The standard is not open and is available only to Zensys/Sigma 
Design customers.
Z-Wave operates as a mesh network in the 900 MHz radio frequency 
range and is optimized for low-overhead commands such as on-off (as in a 
light switch or an appliance), with the ability to include device metadata in 
the communications.
Each device on the Z-wave network has an individual code or address. 
A single Z-wave network supports up to 232 devices. Multiple Z-wave 

4.2  Communications Protocols 
35
networks can be combined via gateways. The controllers can be handheld 
remotes, wall panels, or an internet interface via a browser. Like some of 
the other wireless networks, Z-Wave is a mesh networking technology 
where each node or device on the network is capable of sending and re­
ceiving control commands. Z-Wave can also use power line communication 
technologies.
Z-Wave has a speed of 40 Kbit/s with a range of about 100 feet or 30 
meters. The radio frequencies used include 900 MHz ISM band: 908.42MHz 
(United States), 868.42MHz (Europe), 919.82MHz (Hong Kong) and 
921.42MHz (Australia/New Zealand).
4.2.2.4  RFID
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is different than the other building 
wireless systems. It can’t control anything, and it only identifies things. Its 
primary use is in asset management and security. RFID tags are incorpo­
rated into products or carried by people to identify and track their location 
using radio frequencies. RFID is deployed in retail, hospitals, airports, edu­
cation, and other building uses.
Systems generally consist of RFID readers and tags. RFID tags are simply 
radio transponders. They are a small integrated circuit or computer chip 
which has a tiny radio antenna built in. In passive RFID systems the tag 
does not have its own power source, the tag absorbs energy from the sys­
tem reader antenna, a process called coupling. The tag is programmed with 
a unique identification. When the tag is excited by and absorbs the radio 
waves of the reader antenna it sends out its unique ID which is picked up 
by the reader antenna. 
Active RFID systems tags have their own power source and don’t need 
to use the reader’s antenna radio waves to power up and transmit their 
identity. Active tags have greater range, can store larger amounts of data, 
and are larger than passive tags.
RFID tags come in various sizes and shapes to address a variety of uses. 
The tag can be paper thin to fit inside a book. They also can be directly 
mounted onto equipment, embedded in wrist straps, attached to clothing, 
or worn on a belt.
Wireless tracking systems are only as good as their networks. RFID 
readers have an antenna attached to them. Essentially the reader interfaces 
or sits in between the wireless portion of the system (the antenna) and the 
head end or host system. The antenna attached to the reader sends radio 
signals out to activate tags. It listens for tags to communicate and once a tag 
responds, reads the data transmitted by the tag and sends it to the reader. 
Readers can have multiple antennas attached. The reader can decipher the 
signal and send the data to the host server.

36 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
RFID operates in several radio frequencies: 125 kHz or 134 kHz low-
frequency systems, 13.56 MHz for high-frequency system, and 2 or 3 fre­
quencies for ultra-high frequency systems.
4.2.2.5  Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi basically replaces a cabled Ethernet connection with a wireless device. 
Current Wi-Fi systems operate in two unlicensed radio frequencies, 2.4 GHz 
and 5 GHz. The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 
has set four standards for Ethernet communications via these frequencies 
which are commonly referred to as 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and the lat­
est, 802.11n. 802.11n has a throughput of 110 Mbps. 
The user’s distance from the Wi-Fi antenna, the uses of the same unli­
censed frequencies by other devices, and the obstacles within and the struc­
ture of buildings which could interfere with the radio signals all affect the 
communications bandwidth received from the Wi-Fi antenna. Typical cov­
erage areas indoors for omni-directional Wi-Fi antenna are 100 to 300 feet. 
In the past, the typical use of Wi-Fi in buildings has coexisted with oth­
er wireless systems using the 2.4 GHz radio frequency such as Zigbee and 
Bluetooth. However, Wi-Fi has started to gradually move into the build­
ing control systems. Examples include Wi-Fi temperature sensors (tem­
perature@lert product), Wi-Fi CO2 sensors (AirTest Technologies), Ethernet 
field panels with capability to use Wi-Fi transceivers to establish wireless 
connectivity (Siemens), and Real Time Location Systems (RTLS) (Cisco). 
With more sensors, meters, and control devices generally needed in 
buildings, expect the adoption of wireless buildings systems to accelerate.
4.2.3  Cable Infrastructure
How important is cabling? Cabling, cable pathways, and equipment rooms 
are long term. Many manufacturers provide 20–25 year warranties. So, 
what is initially designed and installed is important. Cable may seem mun­
dane but constant advancements in cable throughput, reductions in poten­
tial interference and increased low voltage power over the telecom cable 
requires the installation of the latest cable technology.
A smart building will take advantage of similar cable standards for IT 
(EIA/TIA 568) and BAS (EIA/TIA 862) and utilize the same cable types 
(twisted pair copper cable and fiber optic cable). This provides an opportu­
nity to reduce the number of cable contractors, reduce  coordination from 
the construction manager, and share cable pathways. In addition, one cable 
can supply communications and provide low voltage power to devices on 
the network via Power over Ethernet (POE). Thus POE eliminates one pow­
er cable, and reduces material and installation time and costs. 

4.3  Construction Costs 
37
The smart buildings approach is to maximize the use of the structured 
cable plant for access control, video surveillance, building automation, and 
other building systems. A smart building will also supplement the wired in­
frastructure with the use of wireless systems; deploying Wi-Fi throughout a 
building, installing a distributed antenna systems (DAS), and using Zigbee, 
Enocean and RFID in building control systems and asset management.
All of the telecom cabling generally terminates in and is managed 
from the telecommunications room. These rooms should be served by dual 
telecommunication entrances, physically separated dual power feeds, and 
emergency power. The telecommunications rooms need to be remotely 
monitored for security, water, temperature, and seismic events. The entire 
infrastructure: cabling, equipment, racks, and wireless access points needs 
to be labeled with predetermined naming conventions and documented for 
asset management and daily operations. As IT continues to penetrate our 
buildings, and our lives, this infrastructure becomes increasingly critical, 
and a key attribute of a smart building.
How can building owners and designers save money in specifying and 
installing a building’s technology infrastructure? Or more importantly, how 
can they make sure the money spent is for the best value? Here are a couple 
tips on saving upfront construction costs and ensuring longer term value for 
the building.
4.3  Construction Costs
4.3.1  Converge The Cabling Types 
There are probably 10–15 different technology systems in a decent size 
building. The telecom systems have standardized on unshielded copper 
twisted pair and fiber optic cable. The building automation systems have 
also standardized on twisted pair and fiber optic cable. While the life safety 
systems have not standardized, some life safety systems, such as video sur­
veillance and access control systems, are using twisted pair and fiber optic 
cable, and some cable manufacturers offer full solutions for life safety sys­
tems using twisted pair and fiber optic cable. The point is that the more you 
use standard twisted pair and fiber optic cable, and the more you get away 
from propriety cabling systems, the greater the opportunity to economize 
and save money.
4.3.2  Coordinate Pathways for All the Technology Systems 
Economize not only on the cable but also the cable pathways. While the ca­
bling of many technology systems have different end-points (such as tenant 
offices, surveillance cameras, HVAC fans, etc.), the longer backbone runs 

38 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
of cabling through a facility may be common pathways. Install one com­
mon highway or pathway for the cabling; try not to build several smaller 
pathways.
4.3.3  Reduce the Number of Cabling Contractors 
Over half of the cost cabling is labor. Why have one contractor install a cable 
from room A to room B, only to have second contractor install a cable for a 
different system from room A to B? Why pay twice when the cost for one 
contractor to install both cables at the same time is marginal? 
4.3.4  Use a Client’s Master Agreements for the Materials and 
Equipment 
Larger clients, such as corporations with many sites, university systems, 
school systems, healthcare entities, etc., should have standardized on the 
materials and equipment they use for their technology systems in their 
facilities. If they’ve standardized and are large enough, they should have 
master agreements with cabling manufacturers or suppliers that an installa­
tion contractor may be able to use. The master agreement will have lower 
prices because of the aggregation of facilities and commitment to suppli­
ers. If you’re client does not have master agreements, advise him that he 
should, and at least make the facility you’re involved with the first to avail 
itself to the lower pricing.
4.3.5  Single Point for Cabling Administration 
If you’re designing a three story building, do you need to have equipment 
rooms on every floor? You could serve the entire building from an equip­
ment room on the second floor if the distance between a second floor equip­
ment room and each cabling endpoint is within the distance for standard 
cabling. There’s a multitude of benefits from doing this; less space is utilized 
for equipment rooms, there’s more efficient use of the network equipment, 
and it’s easier from an operational and maintenance standpoint. The small 
cost for slightly longer cables pales in comparison to the overall savings.
4.4  Operational Costs
The building and the technology infrastructure (at least the cabling, cable 
pathways and equipment rooms) have long lifecycles, and you’ll want to 
balance the initial cost of the technology infrastructure with the long term 
value for the building. Here are a couple things to keep in mind:

4.5  Security 
39
4.4.1  Warranties 
Major cabling manufacturers offer long term warranties on their products 
and systems. If their products are installed by certified installers and the 
installation is inspected by a representative of the manufacturer, they will 
warrant the cable system for 15 to 25 years. Some companies warranty the 
installation and others warranty both the installation and future technical 
applications for the cable. Products that provide such warranties may be 
slightly more expensive, but probably offer better long term value.
4.4.2  Expansion 
Many times the size of equipment rooms are questioned—large equipment 
rooms are provided only to find that a few equipment racks are initially 
provided. Or cable pathways are provided and only half of the pathway is 
initially used. No it’s not a waste of space. It’s long term thinking. You don’t 
ever want to move an equipment room. In addition the emerging building 
technology systems will demand more space, more power, more air condi­
tioning, and more grounding. Build it right once, and avoid the tremendous 
disruption later. 
4.4.3  Use Cabling Consolidation Points 
Cable consolidation points are typically used in open office environments. 
Instead of running each cable from the equipment room to each modular 
office or cubicle, a consolidation point is installed close to the cubicles. You 
may run less cable from the equipment room to the consolidation point, 
and from the consolidation point you have shorter runs to each of cubicles. 
The initial cost of the consolidation point is about the same as running all 
the cabling from the equipment room; the savings is in recabling when 
the cubicles are moved around, which they typically are over time. Many 
modular furniture manufacturers have consolidation points hidden in their 
products that fit in with their modular furniture. 
Owners and designers are tasked with controlling initial construction 
costs while providing for long term value in the buildings that are being 
designed. It can be quite the balancing act. The technology system design 
can contribute to that effort.
4.5  Security
The building automation industry is now at a point where we have legiti­
mate and reasonable concerns regarding the security of building control 

40 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
systems, especially in smart buildings where advanced technology is de­
ployed. We see stories in the news regarding malicious cyber-attacks on 
private companies, government networks and internet sites, and there are 
questions as to what such an attack would mean for building control sys­
tems, building operations, occupants, and owners. The apprehension is am­
plified in newer buildings because there has been increased penetration of 
IT infrastructure in building control systems and greater integration and 
interconnection of building controls with other systems. The potential se­
curity vulnerability of a building can extend to the smart grid as we move 
to implement two-way communication between buildings and the grid, and 
of course it could also impact corporate business systems. The overarching 
security concern is more about network security and less about physical 
security, although the two are certainly related.
For a smart building it is a prerequisite to implement a secured con­
verged network. In addition, the building should have:

 An integrated video network

 Security Measures—Network admission control

 Security Measures—Network intrusion detection

 Security Measures—Ability to segment or isolate the network to limit 
access temporarily or permanently

 QoS management

 Bandwidth management 

 Core equipment and cabling redundancy

 ISP redundancy

 Uninterrupted Power Supply (core network)

 IP device management system

 Monitoring of energy usage of equipment at the data center/MDF/IDF

 Enhanced security elements for integrated networks

 Assign an administrator for building control systems with responsibil­
ity for ongoing network security.

 Utilize IT security measures for the building automation networks. 

 Provide physical security in areas or spaces where BAS equipment is 
located

4.5  Security 
41

 Encrypt and safeguard network traffic. 

 Secure any wireless network
The threat is that someone can penetrate a building’s systems via an un­
secured network to cause damage, disruption, theft or possibly loss of life. 
For traditional IT systems in a building, the threat may be loss of communi­
cations, unauthorized access to sensitive data, theft of intellectual property, 
disruption of equipment (which may include physical security systems such 
as access control and video surveillance), loss of data, and impediments or 
stoppage of normal business operations. For the other building systems, 
such as HVAC control, electrical distribution, lighting, and elevators, the 
threat is disrupting critical building infrastructure, which also impedes or 
stops normal operations. Depending on the building use and building con­
trol system, a security threat may be related to life safety; for example, dis­
rupting emergency power, lighting, and HVAC in a critical healthcare space. 
The threat to building systems is not hypothetical; the infamous Stuxnet 
cyber-attack in 2010 eventually affected programmable logic controllers 
(PLC), a controller heavily used in industry, but also commonly used in 
buildings, for example in elevators and lighting equipment.
In general the building automation industry and facility management 
has treated the security of building control networks as a secondary or 
tertiary issue, if at all. The most popular security approach for a building 
management system (BMS) is to isolate the BMS; not letting it connect to 
any other networks. But that in itself is a false sense of security; the BMS

at a minimum will have fire systems, HVAC, access control, elevators and 
possibly lighting connected into it, potentially allowing access from one of 
those networks or one of the devices on those networks. Some minimal or 
partial security measures may be in place for some buildings, but not the 
comprehensive security measures needed to prevent or minimize network 
vulnerability. It’s fair to say that most traditional building management sys­
tems are not secured. 
In fact, many legacy BMS systems have back doors allowing the BMS 
manufacturer or local control contractor to monitor, manage or update the 
systems. It is interesting that while the recent security concern is about 
newer intelligent buildings, it is older buildings with legacy BMS systems 
that are much more vulnerable to attacks. The legacy systems have less 
computing power and are vulnerable to newer, more powerful and ad­
vanced technology that a hacker may use. The legacy systems are also likely 
to be running older operating systems, some of which may no longer be up­
dated with security patches. In addition, the vulnerabilities of older systems 
are well known to hackers, thus minimizing the effort and time needed for 
an attack. 
The automation industry has rightfully strived for systems standards 
with a move from proprietary implementations to open and transparent 
communication protocols. There are many benefits to open standards: com­
patibility of products, customization, avoiding being locked-in to one man­
ufacturer, interoperability, competitive costs, and more support options. At 
the same time, open and transparent standards would seem to increase vul­
nerability of BAS networks, basically providing all the information hackers 
would need to assess vulnerabilities and potential approaches for an attack. 
This may look like something akin to giving the car thief the keys to the car. 
But one of the upsides of the open standards movement is that it al­
lows those communication protocol standards to incorporate network se­
curity related attributes into the standards. Most major BAS standards have 
incorporated some security mechanisms into their standards. The security 
aspects of BACnet are probably the most advanced. But at the other end of 
the spectrum is Modbus, which has no inherent security capabilities.
A cyber-attack on a BAS network is either going to access the network, 
trying to access or disrupt the communication or exchange of data, or the 
BAS devices, namely the controllers, actuators, and sensors. The BAS net­
work could be accessed physically, or possibly via wireless communication, 
but also through a network device, such as a compromised controller. The 
attacks on the devices are likely to come from the network or physical ma­
nipulation of the device.

4.5.1  Tips on Preventing a Security Breach
Developing, testing, and deploying security measures in buildings needs to 
be an ongoing activity, built into the operation of the building. Here are 
some suggestions for the first steps:
Assign a dedicated network administrator for building control systems, 
with the responsibility for ongoing network security. The network admin­
istrator should coordinate security efforts and responses, as well as internal 
and external assistance. 
Baseline your network. Know what normal traffic is. Identify the indi­
cators of an attack. If facility management is spearheading the effort, bring 
in your IT department early on.
Take a comprehensive approach. Assess every building system, the vul­
nerabilities, and what the loss or disruption of the systems will mean to 
building operations and occupants along with the financial impact.
Start with the use of IT security measures on the building automation 
networks. Understand that while the IT security measures are valuable they 
may not apply to all systems or portions of building control systems. For 
example, at the field or application control level, you may find controllers 
with limited processing power and memory utilizing a limited bandwidth 
network. 
1.	 Provide physical security in areas or spaces where BAS network 
cable runs.
2.	 Encrypt your network traffic. 
3.	 Secure any wireless network
Take into consideration the human aspects of security; the great­
est threat is from the inside; disgruntled employees, employees taking

shortcuts or bringing in their own laptop. Develop policies on passwords, 
configurations, settings, and a training program.
Comprehensively securing a building not only involves access control 
and video surveillance, or an IT security program, but must also include the 
building control and automation systems. 
4.6  Communication and Data Infrastructure
The method of communication and data exchange within and between 
building systems is vital. It is a foundation that will determine the diffi­
culty or ease of integrating system functionality and data. Smart build­
ings shun proprietary protocols in favor of standard open communications 
protocols based on the ASHRAE BACnet I/P, OPC DA, Modbus TCP, oBIX, 
XML, SOAP and SNMP standards of data exchange or similar open standard 
protocols. Many building products now incorporate open protocols, some 
going through a process that verifies or certifies their adherence to the pro­
tocol standard. 
The network architecture of building systems should take into account 
the minimum speeds for serial buses, maximum size in points and devices 
per serial bus, maximum number of serial buses per network controller, 
and the use of native open protocol controllers versus gateways in existing 
buildings. 
The adherence to standard open protocols and detailed network design 
extends not only to building control systems but also to facility manage­
ment systems, business systems, and IT systems in the use of standard data­
base structures such as SQL or ODBC, Oracle, or DB2.
4.7  Facility Management Software
The operation of a facility represents the longest duration of the lifecycle 
of a building and the largest portion of the total lifecycle cost. The facility 
management responsibilities are wide-ranging and multidisciplinary; vary­
ing from responses to immediate alarms or emergencies to long term capi­
tal planning. Throw in the fact that today’s buildings are increasing more 
complex, and the need for a smart building to have top of the line facility 
management tools and processes to effectively manage the facility becomes 
essential. The software facility management applications shape the admin­
istrative processes within facility management. These systems are discussed 
in the following sections.

4.7  Facility Management Software 
45
4.7.1  Work Order System 
This is a system that can initiate work orders, assign tasks to internal staff or 
third party contractors, track the work orders, and archive records. The sys­
tem should allow for analysis of work orders based on building, space, type 
of asset, personnel. The system should also track labor, materials, travel 
expenses and assign relevant work orders.
4.7.2  Preventative and Predictive Maintenance 
This application is used to prevent failure of equipment through the use of 
suggested preventative maintenance from the manufacturer or by predict­
ing equipment failure based on equipment data. The system should support 
the scheduling and tracking of recurring maintenance tasks, automatically 
assign tasks and work orders, and be able to create daily, weekly, monthly, 
and yearly tasks.  Typically this maintenance may involve inspections, test­
ing, measurements, and parts replacement or adjustment.
4.7.3  Space Planning 
This is a software application allowing effective space allocation for the use 
of the building by tenants or owners. It provides the capability to draw and 
manage space with two dimensional floor plans using actual sizes of real 
world objects such as furniture and equipment, walls, windows, doors, etc. 
It allows for the development of alternative space layout and provides the 
basis for real and well-organized space design and planning.
4.7.4  Material and Equipment Parts Inventory Control 
This is basically a system that tracks inventory and identifies inventory 
needs, possibly automatically triggering purchase orders of parts and equip­
ment based on certain thresholds.
4.7.5  Asset Management
This is a critical application that should house all the details of the facility 
assets. It should contain all the details for each piece of equipment. This 
should include the name of the item, identifying serial numbers, location, 
warranties, manufacturer and its maintenance history. The asset manage­
ment application must be integrated into the preventive maintenance ap­
plication and provide data on when preventative maintenance has to occur 
and generate the work order.

46 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
4.7.6  Data standards 
Data is an asset and facility management should have written standard 
methodologies and processes to manage the facility data. This would in­
clude document management, naming conventions and standardized data­
bases, in coordination with other relevant groups and applications, such as 
the IT department and enterprise asset management.
4.7.7  BIM Integration 
Building Information Modeling is the significant data management tool for 
new construction. The data and modeling generated in the use of BIM must 
be exported in the facility management system (specifically the COBie files 
into the asset management application.) This export of design and construc­
tion data into the facility management system is critical to the successful 
handoff from construction to operations. Without it FM and the building 
operations are handicapped at the outset.

The Management of 
Building System Data
A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention 
—Herbert Simon, Economist, 1971
5.1  Overview
There’s a lot of interest in the industry today 
about dashboards, especially energy-related 
dashboards. While dashboards are ultimately 
the user interface into building and energy 
data, very little attention has been given to the 
quality and management of the data behind the 
dashboards. Dashboards are somewhat like the 
cover of a book. The data is the book and the 
fundamental underpinning of the information 
provided to the user who’s looking at the cover. 
The best designed most intuitive dashboards are 
useless if the dashboards utilize inaccurate or 
incomplete data.
Building system data must be viewed as 
an asset: it has value, is necessary for properly 
operating and maintaining the building, and 
it must be managed and treated as such. The 
question is how to get accurate, validated, and 
well organized data from our building systems 

48 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
that can be managed on an ongoing basis. What follows are some of the is­
sues we face in managing building systems data.
5.2  Lack of Planning
Most building operations do not have a data management plan. What passes 
for the data plan consists of a database associated with their Building Man­
agement System (BMS). With this approach the information is limited to 
those systems monitored or managed by BMS. In addition, the setup of the 
database, the naming conventions format and structure is left to the BMS 
contractor, usually with little or no input from the building owner. Further­
more, getting the data out of the BMS database often involves additional 
software or application programming interfaces (API) from the manufac­
turer, sometimes even multiple copies of the same software or APIs based 
on data points limitations of the software or API.
Comprehensive planning means that one should take a broader look 
at all the data and information required in order to manage the building’s 
performance. The data management plan needs to be put in writing and 
a standard operations policy—no more makeshift, improvised approaches. 
An investment of time at the start to properly develop a data plan will save 
time later.
Start the plan with a wide-ranging scope. Identify the data and infor­
mation that different people need to perform their work. Much of the data 
will be monitoring points on building systems, but, some data may be need­
ed from business systems or other systems outside of facility management 
or even outside the organization.
Identify where the data exists or how it will be generated and collected, 
and estimate the scale or volume of data. Decide on a data format. Deal with 
the administrative aspects of the plan such as user access, dissemination of 
the data, how data will be integrated, how it will be archived, retention of 
data policies, and how often the plan is reviewed. Plan the organization of 
the data to assure the data is accurate and easily accessible. 
5.3  Standardized Naming Conventions
Standardize what you call things. A multi-building campus with buildings 
built at different times with different contractors is likely to have multiple 
names and tags for similar pieces of equipment. You don’t want to end 
up with ten different names for air handlers or pumps. Multiple naming 
conventions in an existing building or portfolio of existing buildings is the 
largest and most time consuming issue involved with implementing an in­
tegrated building management system.

5.3  Standardized Naming Conventions

Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
Building system data is no longer only for facility management and 
building operation,  but, also has value for larger business processes such 
as asset management, capital planning, regulatory compliance, energy 
management and a host of other business applications. This basic reality 
cries out for a comprehensive information and data management plan for a 
building or a portfolio of buildings.
Data does not belong to just one department. If you take that approach 
you end up with silos of data and miss opportunities to create meaningful 
metrics and key performance indicators. Consider coordinating the nam­
ing convention or a portion of the naming convention across systems (i.e. 
BMS, asset management, purchasing, work orders, etc.) so that other de­
partments and applications can understand and share the data.
The format of a naming convention for data and equipment is less im­
portant than strict adherence to and enforcement of one standard naming 
convention. 
5.4  Data Mining
Facility managers are missing opportunities if they don’t have the analytic 
tools to mine, predict, and correlate building data. Other organizations and 
businesses mine data from their users and customers and analyze the data 
in order to predict and guide their business. Data mining has been around 
for a while and is used extensively in web sites, retail purchases, financing, 
and smartphones, to name a few.A retailer like Wal-Mart knows how many 
rolls of paper towels are sold daily at each store location, data that is part 
of a process to optimize their just-in-time supply chain process. Yet, how 
many large building owners can even tell you how many people entered 
their building on a daily basis or which building space is the least energy 
efficient? Which is the most used space? Which is the least used?
Data mining related to energy usage would seem to be a wide open field. 
Energy consumption metrics related to space usage, operations processes, 
and business aspects can provide new insights. Predictive value means the 
organization can be proactive rather than reactive. 
5.5  Validation of Data
There’s no point in collecting inaccurate data. To get the most accurate in­
formation you’ll need to tune-up the building systems and check the cali­
bration of sensors and meters. The building systems themselves should be 
regularly recommissioned or better yet continuously commissioned using a 
real-time building system analytic tool.  Traditional commissioning uses the 
design documents and design intent for the foundation of commissioning. 

5.6  Document Management 
51
Over time however, building spaces or uses may change. So that while you 
can confirm or validate the design parameters, for example 54° air being de­
livered by an air handler, the space may have changed and have a different 
cooling load, not needing 54° air from the air handler. There the systems 
may need to be adjusted in order to reflect current conditions.
Sensors and meters should be regularly calibrated,  including the device 
itself as well as the communication between the device and its control­
ler. Inaccurate sensors may provide a false sense of complacency and more 
importantly waste energy and money. For example, assume you have a 
temperature sensor that is 2°off, showing a discharge air temperature of 55° 
when it’s actually 53°; this two degrees may trigger extra cooling and ad­
ditional power consumption by the chiller and air handler or reheating of 
overcooled discharge air which obviously wastes energy. 
5.6  Document Management
How much time do we spend trying to find as-built drawings or some simi­
lar dated documents? While the building systems’ data points can be part 
of a typical database, a significant portion of relevant facility management 
information is likely to be in other formats. These formats include paper, 
such as hard-copy drawings, submittals, O&M manuals, photographs, con­
tracts, faxes, and forms, but, also electronic files in Word, PDF, Excel and 
Autodesk, all of which need to be managed. A document management sys­
tem should be implemented to scan the paper documents into an electronic 
format and store all of the electronic files.
The system typically has an index with a format that may be similar 
to a building database, which either stores the document or directs users 
to another system where the document resides. Systems typically have a 
search capability allowing users to retrieve documents based upon different 
criteria. These systems compliment the data management plan and in order 
to truly integrate they need intuitive indexing with firm adherence to the 
administrative processes of indexing and document conversion.
With the flood of data potentially generated in a building it’s not un­
usual or unexpected to feel overwhelmed. With the proper administrative 
processes the technology generating the data can be put to work tofind the 
valuable information we need to effectively manage our buildings. 
5.7  Benefits of Data Management
There would seem to be a very good case for bringing all the facility data 
into one unified database architecture and putting into practice standard 

52 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
methodologies and processes to manage the data. There are several benefits 
to this approach:

 Building data would be more widely available and sharable:  Setting 
aside confidential data, more data would allow for additional analyt­
ics, possibe new correlations, metrics and insights into the building’s 
performance.

 Building data would be more easily accessible: Have you ever looked for 
as-built drawings or equipment spec sheets, only to discover that they 
are not where they should be? Without a structured approach to data 
management you waste time internally because of the disorganization 
in the data and documents. Many times building operators will need to 
contact the original architects, engineers, or contractors for data, thus 
wasting time and money. What’s needed is an orderly index as part of 
a larger data management system. A structured approach to indexing is 
vital as facility data grows, which is obviously very likely.

 A structured approach can improve the archiving, preservation and re­
tention of data for the long-term: There’s some data and information 
you’ll want for the life cycle of the building and there are analytic op­
portunities in long-term data you’ll want for comparison and trending.

 A comprehensive data management plan would improve the integrity 
of the data:  Bad data is worthless data. You want accurate, reliable, 
consistent, and complete data. A structured approach initially validates 
the data, and then puts into place a process where the data can’t be 
changed or destroyed without authorization.

 Streamlining data: There are roughly 6,500 languages spoken in the 
world today; for data management, you only want one language of 
standard naming conventions, formats, indexing, and data descriptors. 
This makes it easier to access and understand the data.

 Improving efficiency: We don’t organize data for its own sake, but, do 
so in order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of operating 
buildings. A structured approach can provide additional opportunities 
for greater correlation between data, improved data analytics, and the 
possibility of developing or identifying new building data metrics.
5.8  Practical Data Management Activities
Programming: If you’re involved with new construction, going through the 
programming and conceptual design of the facility, the project team should 

5.8  Practical Data Management Activities 
53
identify a person or group that establishes rules for the data management of 
data generated throughout the project. While the focus in new construction 
is typically the construction schedule and the capital budget,  acknowledg­
ment and appreciation of long-term operations, rules and standards for data 
management, and the need to exported data into operations and facility 
management systems is positive.
Building Information Modeling: BIM is the significant data management 
tool for new construction. Data can be generated and stored in the BIM CO­
Bie files throughout the process of design, construction, and commissioning. 
The updating of data occurs several times during the project. Responsibility 
for the data is shared and shifts from the designers to the contractors during 
the project. BIM data also needs to be updated based on RFIs, construction 
related changes, and change orders.
Submittals: Construction submittals are an important milestone in new 
construction or renovation. Submittals usually involve shop drawings, 
product data, samples, and coordination drawings. Quality assurance and 
quality control submittals involve design data, test reports, certificates, and 
manufacturer’s instructions. Submittals must be in an electronic format; 
all of this data and information needs to be provided in an electronic form, 
preferable COBie for the product data, or a format that is part of a building 
owner’s data management system.
Systems Integration: We generally integrate buildings systems to enhance 
functionality; integrating fire systems, access control system, elevators, and 
HVAC are the best examples. We also integrate systems when building own­
ers have multiple BMS systems but want one overall enterprise platform. 
In that case, the larger integration platform acquires data from multiple sys­
tems in various formats using different communications protocols. Through 
the use of middleware the data is standardized and one database is created, 
much like a data management system may use. In some cases the standard­
ization of data to facilitate advanced building management systems is in 
alignment and could be used with an enterprise data management system.
Commissioning: During commissioning and project closeout, data and 
information such as commissioning reports, project record documents, con­
tract drawings, project manuals, contract modifications, startup logs, test re­
ports, certifications, and the complete as-built BIM is generated. All this in­
formation should be permanently retained and accessible. Some documents 
may be paper, such as certifications, but all documents and data should be 
submitted electronically and stored. If the building or systems are modified, 
the designers and contractors will want to use the original record document 
as the baseline.
An immense volume of building data is created during the design, con­
struction and operation of a facility, but, we’ve only managed and analyzed 

54 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
a relatively small amount of the available data. The industry foray into data 
management and analytics is just in its infancy. The initial results, howev­
er, especially FDD applications, are impressive. We should expect the FDD 
model and other analytic methods to apply to other building systems and 
additional data to be generated by new building systems, such as indoor 
positioning systems, motorized shading and water reclamation. The start­
ing point is a facility manager given the responsibility for implementing a 
structured data management system.
5.8.1  The Role of a Facility Data Manager
If you think data is an asset, then you need a person to manage the asset.. 
During design and construction of a building, data will be generated. It is 
in the operations of the building that data not only will be generated, but, 
also consumed. Given that building operations and maintenance is the most 
expensive part of total life cycle costs, and the longest time duration within 
the building’s life cycle, we need data management during every building 
phase: design, construction, and operations.
During design and construction, we typically have two to three people 
tasked with managing various data. One is the LEED consultant tasked with 
gathering energy and sustainability information for the building certifica­
tion. Another is the BIM consultant organizing BIM models and data. The 
third is the architect who uses project management software to communi­
cate and share data with the project team. After commissioning or occu­
pancy of the new building, the roles of the BIM and LEED consultants, and 
possibly the architect, expire.
The facility manager tasked with data management would have a re­
sponsibility in implementing the data management system for the building 
along with the acquisition and management of the data from the initial 
building design through construction and facility management. Facility 
managers design, deploy, maintain, monitor and even enforce a compre­
hensive program for data management.
5.9  Dashboards: Transforming Data into Information
Data is raw material. Its real value is in transforming the data into useful 
information. Information is the finished material when some intelligence 
has been gleaned from analyzing or studying the raw data.
Building systems can provide a lot of data through BAS points, sen­
sors, meters and measurements, yet yield little information. Many of the 
graphics used to display data in a traditional BAS system seem like legacies. 

5.9  Dashboards: Transforming Data into Information 
55
They require enormous setup time and are generally reused from job to 
job. Today’s more advanced integrated building management systems use 
browser-based dashboards for the human-machine or user interface.
It is digital dashboards that can provide relevant and timely informa­
tion to several levels or groups involved with a building’s performance. 
These different users can be facility technicians, managers, C-level execu­
tives, tenants, occupants, or visitors via kiosks or a web page. The informa­
tion provided may cover the specifics of particular building systems such as 
HVAC, electrical, or specialty systems, but, tend to focus on energy usage, 
costs, performance trends, alarm management, comparisons with similar 
buildings, and  KPIs. 
The key to the use of dashboards is twofold. First, one needs to deter­
mine the right information for the viewer of the dashboard. Facility tech­
nicians have different information needs that C-level executives, though 
some of the data to create the information may be similar. The second key is 
the creation of the user interface and interaction with the dashboard, which 
involves visual design and human factors. This is more about how humans 
perceive, evaluate, process, and act on information. What follows are some 
tips on creating the most effective dashboards.
Information can be emphasized or de-emphasized by its position on 
a dashboard. The visual dominance is the in the center of the screen. De­
pending on how the culture  reads (left to right, or right to left) the other 
area of dominance will either be the top left or top right of the screen. The 
other corners are neutral, or in the case of the bottom right, actually de-
emphasized. So the most important data should go in the center or the top 
left of the dashboard. This is especially true if other secondary data on the 
dashboard can only be understood based on understanding  the primary 
information.
5.9.1  Facilitate Comparative Analysis
When you have two charts that are meant to be contrasted, it is best to ar­
range them side by side. This arrangement signifies the need for comparison.
When you have a very narrow range of data, scale the chart to make 
the data fill the chart. This makes it easier for the user to analyze the data.
5.9.2  Customize Chart Scale For Optimal Data Presentation
Sometimes data displayed on a chart has a very narrow range. This makes 
the task of analyzing the data more difficult. Such situations call for ma­
nipulation of the chart scale. The chart scale should be adjusted so that, 

56 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
its lower and upper limit are close to the lower and upper limit of the data 
range. This adjustment will help in accentuating the ups and downs of the 
plotted data, thereby making analysis easier.
5.9.3  Appropriate Selection of Charts
For maximum impact, it is essential that you choose the right chart for 
you data. The pie chart is often used inappropriately. A pie chart is actually 
meant for plotting percentages, but, it is sometimes used for plotting non­
percentage data such as sales, revenue, and quantity.
5.9.4  Proper Formatting of Numbers
It doesn’t make sense to have a chart that displays numbers with excessive 
accuracy. Neither does it help if the chart is cluttered with very large num­
bers. So, it is best to restrict the number of decimal places to 1 or 2. And, 
scale large numbers by defining a proper scaling parameter. The K,M scale 
can be applied to financial charts to scale down numbers that are greater 
than thousand and million.
Dashboards are an important aspect of business management systems 
and are referred to during the planning and decision making process. There­
fore, it is essential to make the dashboard uncluttered and user friendly.
Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful 
tools for communicating important information at a glance. The greatest 
display technology in the world won’t help if you fail to use effective visual 
design. Although dashboards are powerful, their potential is rarely realized. 
And if a dashboard fails to tell you what you need to know in an instant, 
you’ll never use it, even if it’s filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic 
lights. Don’t let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste.
This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create 
dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. Informa­
tion Dashboard Design will explain how to:

tation of information;

effectiveness.
Designing an effective UI for a dashboard can seem a deceptively simple 
task at first, but soon presents challenges sufficient to ensnare even the 
most deliberate of developers. The fundamental challenge with dashboard 
visualization is the conflict of having a limited amount of space in which to 
communicate a lot of information
Ideally dashboards are more than just business scorecards. They should 
do more than attempt to balance financial success with perceived business 
processes, in order to generate growth. Dashboards should provide users 
with the ability to relate and analyze large patterns of information, in order 
to glean new insights or understand the business condition more fully.
The UI should be designed to support the specific types of business deci­
sions and insights users hope to gain by viewing the dashboard. This clearly 
requires more than just a basic understanding of the user’s intent, lest we 
end up with a potpourri of gauges, charts, and tables that only superficially 
describe the health of the business and fail to uncover any meaningful or 
directed insights. Providing the user with an effective and engaging experi­
ence requires the effective use of layout, color, and interactivity in a syn­
chronistic manner.
But the challenge with dashboards is even bigger yet. Beyond visualiza­
tion and UI lie a unique set of engineering requirements for summarizing, 
aggregating, and pre-calculating information computed from large data sets. 
For instance, showing basic sales figures during a period of time filtered by 
product SKU would most likely entail gathering source information from 
some type of ERP transaction system on an order or line-item basis. A com­
pany with any significant order volume could easily be referencing millions 
of transactional records which would need to be summarized across product 
SKU.
Adding other filtering dimensions like geography, channel, market seg­
ment, etc., quickly creates need for some type of back-end data engine to 
aggregate and pre-calculate this summary information. In most cases these 
back end data repositories take the form of a data warehouse, with some 
type of online analytical processing (OLAP) system to process the data with­
in the warehouse.
Yet for many organizations, the data warehouse will never encompass all 
the information that needs to be referenced. Or perhaps they may not have 
sufficient business intelligence systems in place to collect and aggregate the 

58 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
information. In these cases, calculations tend to be performed by the most 
pervasive analysis tool employed by businesses today - the spreadsheet.
Business analysts collect data from several sources by hand in the form 
of extract reports, then import it into a spreadsheet and perform manual 
calculations to prepare reports for consumption by higher level executives. 
This manual aggregation process occurs at varied intervals depending on 
the demands of the business and may work in isolation or in conjunction 
with more automated back end data aggregation.
In both of these scenarios (using a data warehouse/OLAP solution 
to pre-calculate or manually aggregating and calculating data via spread­
sheets) the dashboard designer is faced with the same data structure chal­
lenges. The dashboard will need to collect data from several sources at once 
and present that data in some type of hierarchal format representing dif­
ferent levels of aggregations and calculations. Most dashboards need some 
way to transform, filter, and drill across hierarchal data structures, making 
it critically important to engineer a solution which accommodates these 
structures in a flexible and consistent manner.
When it comes to a development methodology for building dashboards 
there is no silver bullet solution. However, there are some general principles 
which have been found to be effective.
5.9.5  Prioritizing Users Over Data
First among these principles is the choice of basic orientation. There are 
two alternate approaches that can be used when gathering requirements 
for a dashboard project: the traditional “bottom-up” (aka the “data-cen­
tric”) approach; or the more contemporary “top-down” (aka “user-centric”) 
approach.
The data-centric approach is employed most often by teams with more 
of an engineering focus. It concentrates first and foremost on providing 
flexible ways to access the data available to users.
Beginning with the underlying data models, the bottom-up method 
envisions the user experience through the lens of the data structures and 
defines the navigation and access points accordingly. Highly efficient in its 
multi-level data access, the risk in this approach (and the reason many good 
dashboard designers avoid it) is that it often compromises the subtle re­
quirements of the users in favor of accommodating the data. This may lead 
to a poor outcome as success in dashboard design is not necessarily defined 
by having the most flexible access to the widest possible data sets, but rather 
by offering users quick access to the data most relevant to their specific busi­
ness needs.

5.9  Dashboards: Transforming Data into Information 
59
The user-centric approach, in contrast, begins with the questions of 
“what do we need to communicate, to whom, and to what degree of depth? 
Grounded in the requirements of the users, this path ensures that dash­
board design follows a more intuition-guided experience to maximize the 
level of engagement amongst the executive constituents.
While this approach may seem obvious to those with expertise design­
ing UI for web site applications, many engineers more accustomed to work­
ing on back office functionality (e.g. database and report design) might not 
be as familiar. Rest assured that data structures in this approach are no less 
important, but often need to be bent and molded through filtering and sum­
marizing techniques, which can result in table structures that are inefficient 
in the classical data sense, but optimized for a superior user experience.
Traditionalists often raise concerns about minimizing the importance 
of sound data management principles, in particular when large volumes of 
transaction-level data are involved. However, most dashboards are not used 
as data-mining tools seeking insights at the lowest level of data capture, 
but rather performance summary systems offering a broad view of things 
with one or two levels of drill-in capability to answer the most common 
questions.
The user-centric approach requires a keen understanding of the user’s 
needs, and the ability to design around them. This can be reduced to two 
fundamental questions:
What decisions or insights does the user hope to make by interacting 
with the dashboard?
What data is needed and how does it need to be presented to answer 
those questions?
In some cases, after gathering user requirements, it becomes clear that 
key pieces of data needed are not stored in the current data repository. In 
order to add meaningful insight to the data already available, it becomes 
necessary to devise a way to incorporate the missing elements. In a bottom 
up approach, this realization may not have occurred until the dashboard 
was deployed to the user audience.
Trying to design an OLAP solution for a dashboard without clear re­
quirements from end-users is a dicey proposition, mostly because users of­
ten have a difficult time articulating requirements until they’ve had an op­
portunity to tactilely experience the dashboard for themselves by pointing, 
clicking, dragging, and dropping. Prior to having a chance to “play” with the 
UI, users struggle with the prospect of validating back end data schemas and 

60 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
data structure requirements as these artifacts are too far removed from the 
real world use of the dashboards.

Executive Dashboard project participants are fortunate when they have 
the opportunity to work with true graphic designers on the visual design 
portion of the dashboard. There is a real opportunity to see that design is a 
discipline and that the value the visual design team is not merely skin deep, 
but integral to the success of the dashboard interface. Of course, graphic 
designers vary in skill and understanding, but you know you are in the pre­
sense of a real master when they teach you the fundamentals of their trade. 
When they expose the “why” of their decision making, you learn that mak­
ing your business intelligence dashboard intuitive relies on understanding 
factors of human perception.
Let me illustrate the point with a great example from the incredible 
book, Designing Interfaces by Jenifer Tidwell. In the chapter on “The Basics 
of Information Graphics,” Tidewell points out a topic of great interest and 
value: Pre-Attentive Variables.
Basically, the idea is that you have to choose your visual features very 
carefully because they operate “preattentively”—that is, they convey infor­
mation before the user pays conscious attention.
Now that you know how important it is to use preattentive variables 
when you need to impress upon your user a quick understanding, wouldn’t 
you like to know what the actual preattentive variables are? Of course, so

5.10  The Handoff Between a Newly Constructed Building and 
Building Operations; How Not To Fumble
Example is not the main thing in influencing others, it’s the only thing.
                                                      —Albert Schweitzer
One reason a building may not perform as well as it should is often related 
to how the newly constructed structure was “handed off” to building opera­
tions. A poor transition process may mean the building operations get off 
to a bad start and never fully recover or only catches-up after much effort. 
Design and construction phases for a new building have structured pro­
cesses, and the handoff activities from new construction to operations are 
addressed in the project specifications. Despite the clear requirements and 
acknowledgement of close out activities, the transition or handover is often 
undervalued, misunderstood and overlooked. 
Many of the critical elements of the “handover” pertain to the build­
ing systems and the relevant data or information regarding the design and 
construction of the building. However, these are not the only concerns and 
activities in the move to building operation. Prior to the turnover the build­
ing owner will need to determine staffing for maintenance and operations, 
and then assign and train the staff. Prior to occupancy the owner will also 
oftentimes be involved with the furniture and equipment, warranties, cor­
rection periods, record documents, spare parts, extra materials and special­
ized operating tools.

62 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
Addressing this transition from construction to operations, specifically 
regarding the building systems and data will improve the initial and long 
term operational performance in turn saving money and increasing the val­
ue of the building. In the following section are some tips on how to avoid 
fumbling the ball.
5.10.1  Give Operations Personnel a Seat at the Table with the De­
sign and Construction Teams
This happens frequently but not all the time. As active participants the op­
erational personnel is able to provide perspective into the operational and 
maintenance aspects of materials or design and construction alternatives. 
This must be tempered with an awareness of the natural inclination to sim­
ply operate the new building the same as the old building, especially an 
issue when the operations of the existing building are sub-optimal. This 
interaction helps to assure the facility manager is familiar with the new fa­
cility and allows the FM an opportunity to develop its O&M program.
5.10.2  Install Some of the Facility Management Software Applica­
tions Relatively Early in the Construction Process
Don’t do the typical thing and wait until the end of construction. Using 
software tools, such as system analytics, will assist in commissioning and 
start-up and installing them earlier in the process facilitates a longer time 
period for testing the tools and staff training. This initiative is consistent 
with a larger issue in that technology and specifically some form of an IT 
network should be in a building under construction earlier as well. For ex­
ample, if you’re installing BAS network controllers that directly connect to 
an IT network, the IT network has to be installed or you can’t fully test the 
system. Some of the IT components (servers, firewalls, etc.) may be in the 
“cloud” while the building is being constructed, and then later brought into 
the building.
5.10.3  Have the General Contractor or Sub-Contractors Operate 
the Building For a Short Time, and Then Transfer Operations to the 
Owner
While this model has generally been used on larger infrastructure projects 
the beauty of this approach is the incentives it provides the construction 
contractor to get the building operations right. The contractor has “skin in 

the game”. While this approach still involves an eventual handoff to the 
owner, the likelihood of a “cleaner” handoff is often much improved.
5.10.4  Insist On the Use of BIM During Design and Construction
Generally the transfer of data from the design and construction processes 
into a facility management system is inefficient and ineffective. Most of it 
is paper handed over in three-ring binders and boxes, supplemented with 
CDs of drawings and specifications. Lost in this handoff is data and infor­
mation that could improve the management and operation of the building. 
Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows for the design and construc­
tion data and information to be transferred electronically. 
5.10.5  The Most Value That Operational Personnel Can Bring to the 
Table Is Their Involvement In Defining the Requirements of Com­
missioning, System Start-Up, and Close Out Procedures
The owner’s facility staff doesn’t replace the project’s commissioning agent 
or take on the responsibilities of the contractor. However, it is the commis­
sioning, system start-up, demonstration of equipment operation and load 
testing that are at the heart of close-out activities and the turning over of 
the building systems. The facility staff’s involvement in these processes is 
essential to a smooth transition.

5.10.6  Identify the Data, Information and Resource Materials 
Needed to Operate the Building
Operating and maintaining a new facility requires data and information. 
The building owner, with the participation of the design and construction 
teams, needs to define the data and information required for efficient and 
effective operation of the systems and related services during the facility 
design process. These requirements will be part of the commissioning and 
close-out activities as well. Typically a contractor provides the owner record 
documents. These are O&M manuals, record submittals, shop drawings, 
and record specifications and drawings. Whatever the requirements, they 
need to be part of the contract documents for construction.
The discussion of data and information needs may also spur interest in 
more data points, such as meters or sensors that gather data. The process 
can also identify the need to integrate data into the owner’s business sys­
tems. If it does, it’s a good thing as it demonstrates the project team is look­
ing forward to operational needs.
5.10.7  The Expectations of Contractor’s Requirements Must Change 
From Just Installing Equipment to Completing and Leaving Their 
Work In a Condition for Long Term Operations and Support
Too many times contractors will install equipment, complete their de­
liverables and then reduce staffing and move on to the next job prior to 
completion of close-out activities. The result may be incomplete work or 
at the least, less than optimal involvement in close-out activities. Contract 
requirements and the mentality of the project team needs to be focused 
on the most important and costly part of the building’s lifecycle: long term 
operations and maintenance.
5.10.8  Conduct a Review of the Transition to Operations and Docu­
ment Lessons Learn 
Regardless of your expertise or experience there is always an opportunity to 
learn from each project closeout or at least confirm that existing procedures 
are producing the expected results. 
During the design and construction processes the focus is often on 
schedules and budgets. And with that process taking a couple years, build­
ing operations may seem far off and something that can be addressed close 
to completion. Better “handoffs” and transitions prescribe that we embed 
operations and maintenance into every aspect of design and construction.

Lighting
6.1  Overview
Lighting affects several important aspects of a 
building. There is the aesthetic impact it will 
have on the building and its spaces, resulting 
in how occupants will perceive and react to 
the built environment. There is the more func­
tional aspect of providing lighting to facilitate 
life safety and the work occupants undertake in 
and around the building. And finally, lighting 
is a significant consumer of energy. It is esti­
mated that lighting accounts for 21% of electric 
power consumption in commercial buildings 
and about 14% of electricity usage and costs 
in residential buildings. Unneeded and uncon­
trolled lighting within a building wastes energy 
and increases facility operational costs.
Different building uses will have different 
focuses for  the building’s lighting. These might 
be as part of building security, to maximize oc­
cupant productivity, energy conservation, or 
just to enhance the emotional reaction of occu­
pants, for example, in retail stores or theaters.

66 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
A smart building entails a centralized lighting control system in all the 
building’s usable square footage. The system should provide a dimmable 
lighting strategy. It also should have a global and zone light schedule and 
override capabilities. Lighting can also affect other technology systems, such 
as the need to cool spaces where lighting has increased the temperature. 
Lighting control systems provide lighting for occupants of the building as 
needed, but do it in an efficient manner, consistent with any applicable 
building needs and energy codes.
The requirement for lighting in a building varies by building type, spac­
es within the building, time of day, and occupancy of the building. Con­
sequently, the control strategies and functions of a lighting control system 
reflect these variances and primarily involve:

 Scheduling: A control system may have a predetermined schedule of 
when lights are turned on and off.

 Occupancy Sensors: For building spaces  where occupancy is difficult 
to predict (such as meeting rooms or restrooms), lights may be turned 
on and off based on a lighting control system device sensing occupancy.

 Daylight: To reduce the need and cost of lighting spaces, a control sys­
tem utilizes natural light as much as possible. This is sometimes called 
daylight harvesting or daylighting.

 Window coatings: Spectrally selective window coatings, designed for 
hot climates with large amounts of solar radiation, work by selectively 
filtering out frequencies of light that produce heat while minimizing 
the loss of visible light transmission.
The lighting control system distributes power to the available lighting 
units in a typical fashion, but inserts digital control and intelligence in many 
of the control devices, such as the circuit breaker panel, wall switches, 
Figure 6.1  Lighting in a building.

6.2  System Control 
67
photocells, occupancy sensors, backup power, and lighting fixtures. The 
control system significantly increases the functionality and flexibility of 
the lighting system by providing digital control and intelligence to the end 
devices. For example, a reconfiguration of lighting zones is accomplished 
through software rather than the physical recabling. In addition, intelligent 
end devices allow more focused application of lighting control  strategies to 
specific spaces within the building.
6.2  System Control
The heart of the lighting control center is typically a web-enabled server,, 
a workstation with a GUI interface, and client software applications for 
system administration. The lighting control system may be interconnected 
to other facility technology systems, such as shading or the HVAC system. 
The networked system allows any authorized individual, including tenants 
or other occupants, to adjust their lighting through the network or a web 
browser.
One approach to the lighting control system is the use of intelligent 
controllers These controllers are distributed throughout a facility, house 
system electronics, and manage downstream relay panels. The control­
lers and the system server are networked via an Ethernet network, usually 
sharing schedules and overrides. The controller may have a user interface 
panel, which can be used instead of a system workstation, to program and 
monitor the lighting control system. 
System controllers may be modular to allow for growth. The controller 
may also have several communications interfaces such as an Ethernet port, 
and ports for RS-232 and RS-485 communications. The system controller 
communicates with each of the panels through an Ethernet connection, or 
a BACnet, LonTalk or Modbus protocol that is routed to a larger IP network. 
Another emerging networking strategy for lighting control systems is 
distribution of the intelligence and control further downstream to each de­
vice by providing a network interface for each device, such as a lighting bal­
last. This approach centralizes the control to the network server and allows 
for network interfaces to specific devices.
6.2.1  Relay Panels
Relay panels are typically mounted next to the electrical circuit breaker 
panels. The circuit breaker panel feeds into the relay panel, with the relays 
within the panel acting as a switching device for the circuit. Many relay 
panels can be fed by both 120V and 277V circuit breaker panels, and relay 
groups can be fed by different voltages within the same panel. Each relay

can be individually programmed through the system controller or the relay 
panel. 
The relay panels provide line voltage control of the lighting loads. Re­
lay panels allow for a single circuit to feed into several relays, and allow 
multiple circuit breaker panels to feed into a single relay panel. While relay 
panels can be programmed or controlled by a system controller, they can 
also operate without the system controller. The relay panels typically have 
status indicators for the relay outputs, dry contact inputs for program over­
ride purposes, and inputs for monitoring devices, such as photocells and 
occupancy sensors.
In a multi-story facility, there may be a relay panel on each floor con­
trolling all the lights on the floor. Each room on the floor has a local switch 
and there is also a master switch for the whole floor. The master switch for 
the floor may be programmed to turn lights on at 7AM and off at 6PM; be­
tween 6PM and 7AM, the system may repeatedly perform an Off sweep to 
turn lights out where the programming has been overridden.
6.2.2  Occupancy Sensors
Occupancy or motion sensors are devices that sense the presence or ab­
sence of people within their monitoring range. Unlike scheduling controls, 
occupancy sensors do not operate on a time schedule, they merely detect 
whether a space is occupied or not. They may be used in restrooms, util­
ity rooms, conference rooms, coffee rooms, locker rooms, and many other 
spaces. Typically, the sensor and a control unit can be enclosed in one unit, 
such as a wall box, but for larger facilities, the sensor is tied to a relay panel. 
The control unit or the relay is programmed to turn lights on when the pres­
ence of people is sensed by the motion detector, and may be programmed to 
turn the lights off when the space is unoccupied for a predetermined time 
period. The sensitivity of the sensor may also be adjustable.

6.2  System Control 
69
There are several types of motion sensors available, including passive 
infrared (PIR), active ultrasound, and hybrid technologies, such as combi­
nations of PIR and active ultrasound, or PIR and audible sound. These sen­
sors are typically used in locations such as hallways, lobbies, private offices, 
conference rooms, restrooms, and storage areas. 
Ultrasonic sensors emit high frequency sound waves (ultrasonic) and 
sense the frequency of the reflected waves as they return to the device. 
Movement in the area where the waves are emitted changes the frequency 
of the reflected waves, causing the sensor to turn the lights on. Ultrasonic 
motion detectors provide continuous coverage of an area and are best suit­
ed for use in open areas, such as offices, classrooms, and large conference 
rooms. Mechanical devices that produce vibrations or changes in airflow, 
such as HVAC systems, can trigger ultrasonic occupancy sensors and cause 
lights to turn on.
PIR sensors detect radiation, that is, the heat energy that is released by 
bodies. They are labeled passive because they only accept infrared radiation 
and do not emit anything. PIRs operate in a line of sight and have to see an 
area, so they cannot be obstructed by open area partitions or tall furniture. 
PIRs use a lens to focus heat energy so that it may be detected. However, the 
lens views the covered area through multiple beams or cones and may cre­
ate coverage gaps. Any objects that prevent the sensors from seeing portions 
of its designated area will cause the sensor to assume the area is unoccupied 
and turn the lights off, even when it isn’t.
Careful placement of occupancy sensors is required to prevent false 
(nonintruder caused) alarms. Occupancy sensors should not be mounted in 
the direction of a window. Although the wavelength of infrared radiation to 
which the chips are sensitive does not penetrate glass very well, a strong in­
frared source such as from a vehicle headlight or sunlight reflecting from a 
vehicle window can overload the chip with enough infrared energy to fool 
the electronics and cause a false alarm. A person moving on the other side

of the glass however would not be seen by the device. Devices should not 
be placed in such a position that an HVAC vent would blow hot or cold air 
onto the surface of device. Although air has very low emissivity (emits very 
small amounts of infrared energy), the air blowing on the plastic window 
cover could change the plastic’s temperature enough to fool the electronics.
Other technologies and approaches to motion detection include sens­
ing audible noise. Hybrid sensors (PIR and ultrasound, PIR and audible) 
offer the most effective occupancy detection and have maximum sensitivity 
without triggering false detections.
The placement of occupancy sensors is key to their working properly. 
Sensors can be mounted on walls or ceilings, and using multiple sensors 
can sometimes provide more accurate detection, especially in large or ir­
regularly shaped areas. Occupancy sensors must be able to detect motion 
in their assigned space while ignoring mechanical vibrations and other false 
signals. Any malfunctioning of an occupancy sensor could be dangerous, 
especially if the area were a stairwell or other location where illumination 
is important for safety. Occupancy controls are best used in applications 
where occupancy does not follow a set schedule and is not predictable.
6.2.3  Dimmers
Dimmer modules manage low voltage switch and line voltage output con­
trols of the dimmer’s lighting loads. Stand-alone dimmers typically have 
status indicators, analog inputs for photocell or occupancy sensors, diag­
nostics, and are able to optimize responses for different types of lighting 
fixtures. Dimmers can be used for specific spaces, such as areas with au­
dio-visual presentations, or throughout the total system for managing large 
facilities. 
Like occupancy sensors, dimmer switches connected to a relay panel. 
Preset dimming controls from a relay panel provide predetermined dim­
ming for several channels or loads. Presets are tamper-proof, that is to say, 
they will not allow anyone except the approved and authorized lighting 
control personnel to override the presets.
Dimming can be used to implement several energy savings strategies. 
For example, lights can be dimmed when the demand for electricity exceeds 
a predetermined level, possibly as part of an overall load shedding policy. 
Such reductions are typically unnoticeable for most users. Another example 
involves fluorescent lamps. The output of fluorescent lamps decreases over 
the life of the lamp (the expected depreciated output may be used as an 
initial design factor). Dimming can be used with new fluorescent lamps to 
produce the desired light level and then gradually manage the lighting level 

6.2  System Control 
71
over the life of the lamps, to produce both a constant level of light output 
as well as a longer lamp life.
6.2.4  Daylight Harvesting
Photoelectric controls are designed to strategically use daylight to reduce 
the need for artificial lighting, a process called daylight harvesting. They 
may be located in perimeter offices, atriums, hallways, or in areas with sky­
lights. Ambient light sensors measure natural and ambient light, and based 
on the amount of natural light, adjust the lighting to maintain a constant 
light level. In some spaces, manual or automatic blinds, or other means of 
reducing the direct solar exposure glare, excessive light levels, and heat 
gain, can be used to supplement the photoelectric control. These may in­
clude motorized window shades or blackout shutters.
Proper daylight harvesting design not only includes providing enough 
daylight to an area, but doing so without any undesirable side effects, such 
as heat gain and glare. Successful daylight harvesting designs will incorpo­
rate shading devices to reduce glare and excess contrast in an area. Window 
size and spacing, glass type, and the reflectance of interior finishes must be 
taken into account as well. Despite all of these design considerations, day­
light harvesting provides little benefit without an integrated electric lighting 
system, because of the increased thermal loads from the sun. The electric 
lighting and thermal loads must be reduced while simultaneously increas­
ing daylight to an area.
6.2.5  Ballasts
By definition, an electrical ballast is a device that limits the amount of cur­
rent in an electric circuit. In electrical gas discharge lights, such as fluores­
cent and neon lights, ballasts control the current flowing through the light. 
Incandescent light bulbs produce light by running electricity through 
a metal filament inside the bulb, which heats it and causes it to glow and 
emit visible light. When fluorescent lights are turned on, electricity flows to 
two electrodes on opposite ends of the lamp, causing them to heat up. The 
electrodes, which are very similar to a filament in an incandescent bulb, 
then become hot and emit electrons which collide with and ionize noble 
gas atoms inside the bulb. This creates a voltage difference between the two 
electrodes, causing electricity to flow between the two electrodes, through 
the gas in the tube. These gas atoms become hot which vaporizes the liquid 
mercury inside the tube. 
The mercury vapor then becomes excited and emits ultraviolet light, 
which hits a white phosphor coating that converts the ultraviolet light into 
visible light. Due to an effect known as avalanche ionization, without a device 

72 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
to regulate the electricity flowing through the bulb the gas would continue 
becoming more excited and higher intensity light would be emitted until 
the light failed. Thus it is necessary to have a ballast to regulate current 
through the gas. Modern ballasts supply the electricity needed to start the 
lamp and produce light, and then regulate the current so the lamp will pro­
duce the desired light intensity. 
There are two main types of ballasts: magnetic and electronic. Magnetic 
ballasts use electromagnetic induction to create the voltages used to start 
and operate fluorescent lights. They contain copper coils which produce 
electromagnetic fields that control voltage. Magnetic ballasts, which have 
been used in fluorescent lights since their origin, are considered outdated 
and are being phased out by newer electronic ballasts. Electronic ballasts 
use solid state circuitry to control voltage to the lamp rather than magnetic 
coils, which makes them more energy efficient. One of the main problems 
with magnetic ballasts is that, while they can control the current to the 
light, they cannot alter the frequency of the input power. Because of this, 
the lamp illuminates on each half-cycle of the input power, causing the 
lamp to flicker and produce a low humming noise. This flicker can cause 
eye strain and headaches in some people, and the humming can be bother­
some and distracting. Electronic ballasts can control the input frequency, 
eliminating these problems. Another advantage of electronic ballasts over 
magnetic ballasts is that one electronic ballast can control more than one 
lamp, allowing for multi-lamp fixtures to be controlled by a single ballast.
From these two main categories, fluorescent ballasts come in three dif­
ferent types: rapid start, programmed start, and instant start. Rapid start 
ballasts start lamps by simultaneously providing voltage to the electrodes 
and across the lamp itself. As the electrodes become hotter and emit more 
electrons, less voltage is required for the lamp, and eventually the cathodes 
will become hot enough to ignite the lamp on their own. 
Programmed start ballasts are more advanced versions of rapid start bal­
lasts. They have preprogrammed start-up sequences designed to give supe­
rior longevity to their lamps. Rather than supplying simultaneous voltage, 
programmed start ballasts first apply voltage to the electrodes to heat them 
up for a short interval, then apply voltage to the lamps. This helps to avoid 
a common problem in fluorescent lights called tube blackening, which occurs 
when the electrodes are damaged from voltages without sufficient heating. 
Programmed start ballasts have the longest lamp lives and are best used in 
locations with lights that are constantly being turned on and off, such as 
restrooms.
Instant start ballasts start lamps by providing a high voltage directly 
to the lamps without preheating the electrodes at all. Because there is no 

6.3  Integration into Building Automation Systems 
73
heating time, light is produced within 50 milliseconds, thus giving it the 
name instant start. Instant start ballasts have the highest energy efficiency 
of any ballast and the lowest cost, but they suffer from emissive material de­
fects like the rapid start ballasts. Instant start ballasts are best used in lights 
that are not turned on and off very often. 
For certain applications where a light is intended to be constantly on 
and off, such as a flashing light, there are ballasts which will keep the elec­
trodes heated even when the light is off, which greatly increases the life 
span of the light. 
6.3  Integration into Building Automation Systems
Lighting systems provide a life safety function, assisting in security or light­
ing evacuation pathways from a building. Lighting systems may be integrat­
ed with fire alarm systems, security systems, or emergency power genera­
tors. In the case of a fire alarm or loss of normal power, the lighting control 
system may turn on key emergency lighting fixtures.
Data and information from a lighting system is also an integral part of 
an overall energy strategy and at some facility or business level needs to be 
considered with HVAC systems, metering, and building plug loads. Moni­
toring the number of hours that the lights are operated and the number 
of times lights are turned on provides information in estimating lamp life, 
which can be used to schedule group relamping.
Lighting systems have a communication protocol called digital address­
able lighting interface or DALI for ballasts and relay switches, which was de­
veloped in the 1990s. For a DALI implementation, each lamp uses dimming 
ballast and each lamp has its own network address. DALI uses a two-wire 
low-voltage wiring scheme in a bus topology, with the bus providing both 
power and control signals to the ballast.
DALI is an open-source protocol based on standard IEC60929, which 
specifies performance requirements for electronic ballasts. Each DALI con­
troller (called a busmaster) can handle up to 64 addresses and 16 groupings. 
Because the DALI protocol is solely for use by lighting control systems its 
integration to other systems may require a protocol translation with sys­
tems using BACnet or LonWorks. DALI has been extended into shading 
control, and wired network connectivity has been supplemented with wire­
less connectivity.
Programming lighting control systems use smart technology infrastruc­
ture at the higher levels of the control system. Technology evolution is in­
troducing increased use ofstructure cable, Ethernet, and TCP/IP protocols.

6.4  Emerging Lighting Systems
The relentless penetration of IT has a long history of changing building sys­
tems; transforming analog phones to digital phones, analog surveillance 
cameras to IP cameras, IP-enabled access control, IPTV as well as a host of 
other systems. The next building system to transform to an IT structure is 
low voltage LED systems. The impetus for an IT structure is linked to the 
fact that LEDs are low voltage light sources. One way of providing low volt­
age is installing AC power and converting it to DC; this will work but adds 
costs, additional points of failure, and generates additional unwanted heat. 
Meanwhile, the IT industry has been providing low voltage DC power 
via Power over Ethernet (PoE) for over a decade. In 2003 an IEEE standard 
was published allowing low voltage power (48 VDC) to be transmitted over 
an Ethernet Category 5 Twisted Pair cable. With the initial standard, the 
maximum that can be delivered to a powered Ethernet device is 15.4 watts, 
which is sufficient to power many low powered devices. Since its inception, 
the wattage of PoE has increased, and is now able to provide as much as 100 
Watts for some devices.
PoE has several benefits:

 It costs less: It is much less expensive to provide a PoE network port 
than to install conduit, wire, a backbox for an AC outlet, a transformer 
for conversion, and pay for  an electrician. PoE significantly reduces the 
cost of installation and construction. As an example, Purdue Univer­
sity installed over 1,100 PoE wireless access points across campus, and 
saved $350 to $1,000 per location by not having to install typical AC 
power. Others have estimated that the electrical cost to provide power 
to a device is about $864, while the cost of a PoE network port is around 
$47-$175. 

 PoE increases reliability: PoE centralizes power distribution. Instead of a 
power outlet at each local device power is now distributed from the tel­
ecom rooms. Centralized power makes it easier to provide uninterrupt­
ible and emergency power for critical hardware such as LED emergency 
lighting, thus increasing system reliability and uptime.

 End devices can be monitored and managed: Network switches provide 
management tools such as the Simple Network Management Protocol 
(SNMP), which allows staff to manage the end devices, including power 
to the end device. You can remotely turn the device on or off, change 
lighting levels, colors, schedules, and monitor energy consumption.

 Moves, addition, and changes are easier: PoE allows for asier building 
renovations and rearranging of spaces since devices only need one ca­

6.4  Emerging Lighting Systems 
75
ble. It’s easier to install devices on walls or ceilings and to setup tempo­
rary installations.

 It’s an international standard: PoE is marketed and deployed world­
wide, allowing manufacturers to avoid supplying different power cords 
for different countries, and eliminating the need for installers to worry 
about power cords. Manufacturers, contractors, building owners and 
designers can deploy a uniform solution around the world.

 Less high voltage is used in the building: PoE means that more low volt­
age distribution is used to power devices, and less high voltage is used 
throughout a building. This results in a safer environment and lower 
power consumption.
IT-based LED lighting systems can allow for additional sensors, such as 
occupancy, temperature, automated daylight harvesting based on ambient 
light levels, and passive motion sensors, with the data points shared with 
other building systems where appropriate. With the data from the light­
ing system and the building BMS, there is opportunity to create a rules-
based lighting system, similar to HVAC’s fault detection and diagnostic rules, 
where real time lighting and environmental data can be used to optimize 
the lighting system or can be shared with other building systems.
The use of DC is important. In most buildings, including our homes, we 
are surrounded by devices and equipment that internally operates on direct 
current (DC). We plug these devices into a typical alternating current (AC) 
outlet, but the AC is then converted to DC, and each conversion creates an 
energy loss. In addition, many newly constructed buildings are deploying 
renewable energy sources such as solar or wind which can generate DC 
power. With the large number of DC powered devices in buildings, and 
with DC generation now utilized in many newer structures, the addition of 
a DC LED lighting system adds to the consideration of distributed DC power 
in buildings and the maximization of the use of DC power generated by 
renewables.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have published a paper 
evaluating the cost of energy for lighting systems and concluded that a DC 
grid is far less expensive powering LED lighting. Researchers say DC power 
could save $24,000 a year in a 48,000-ft2 building lit by solid-state lighting 
(SSL).
While the approaches to IT-based LED lighting systems are sound, they 
do come with a few issues:

 IT contractors can certainly install an IT system, but they are neither 
electrical nor lighting contractors. They will need training on installing 

76 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
lighting fixtures and  handling stringer supports, mounting downlights 
in ceilings, or installing ceilings supports for pendant fixtures.

 Can IT understand required light levels, light distribution, contrast, 
color rending, luminous ﬂux, luminous intensity and the lighting needs 
of particular spaces? IT contractors may need to partner with a lighting 
company or develop in-house expertise. For a typical lighting control 
company, the reverse may be true, that is the lighting companies will 
need to team with an IT contractor or develop internal IT resources.

 Also, many times a lighting system for new construction may go be­
yond a lighting system to include a comprehensive solution incorporat­
ing motorized shading and sensors for sun tracking and thermal loads. 
These systems have to be integrated to optimize the thermal load from 
the windows with shades so as not to start the HVAC system cooling, 
as well as optimize occupant light levels. That type of complexity is be­
yond simply providing low voltage DC to an LED. 

 Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are semiconductors. They can be config­
ured in an analog mode to be used primarily in older lighting systems, 
but new systems are likely to be all digital. Digital means an infinite 
number of colors, scenes, brightness settings, and control. IT-based low 
voltage LED lighting systems provide energy efficiency, long lasting LED 
lights, the use of DC power, the opportunity for additional sensors and 
data points to assist in managing the building’s performance, and lev­
eraging the IT network to deploy the lighting systems. The low voltage 
LED lighting system seems to best reflect the goals of the building in­
dustry regarding building control systems. 
We typically don’t think of the building’s envelope as having much need 
for automation. However the fenestrations—specifically the windows—
have a critical role in relation to energy related thermal loads and lighting 
in building spaces. The sun provides heat and light, and affects the thermal 
loads and lighting levels in building spaces. The comfort and productivity 
of the occupants is very important including  thermal comfort and visual 
comfort such as brightness, glare, and shadows. Attention to windows has 
resulted in automation of windows and window shading devices.
6.4.1  Interior Shading
Until a few years ago most experience with interior shading in a typical 
commercial office space dealt primarily with the impact on audio-visual 

6.4  Emerging Lighting Systems 
77
presentations in meeting rooms. Often, blackout shades eliminated light 
and glare, and attendees experienced almost a movie theater type of light­
ing environment. Interior shading today is focused on energy conservation, 
specifically addressing the reduction of heat gain from the sun and daylight 
harvesting.
Interior shading tends to be less effective than exterior shading and 
window treatments for energy conservation, because interior shading deals 
with the sun’s heat after it has already entered the building. Some of the 
effectiveness of interior shading depends on the color of the shade; light 
colors reflecting some of the sun’s heat, dark colors absorbing the sun’s 
heat. Except for some energy-related benefits interior shading functions 
best when it is filtering rather than blocking light and controlling glare.
Manual interior shading further decreases the energy effectiveness 
of the shading because it depends on a user’s behavior, which may be in­
termittent. Automated interior shading uses motors to move the shade in 
place, with the control of the motor determining the overall automated 
functionality of the shade. Automated shades can respond to sun sensors, 
switches, a schedule, or a specific lighting condition.
When shading is deployed building-wide the network topology of the 
shading devices is analogous to a BAS system; that is individual shade mo­
tors are connected to a controller, which in turn are connected to a BACnet 
network. Eventually it connects to an IP network which includes a server 
connected for the management and monitoring of the shades. The shade 
server will typical have read and write capabilities for all points and values, 
and provide data on shade position and overall system operation.
6.4.2  Exterior Shading
Exterior shading comes in many flavors. Shading can be attached to the 
building skin or designed into the building; for example. windows can be 
set back deeply into a wall section to provide some shading. Both methods 
need to address exterior aesthetic concerns. Overall, exterior shading may 
be more aesthetically pleasing than interior shading which tends to have 
shades in a variety of positions. Exterior shades can be fixed or adjustable. 
Automated adjustable shades provide the most effective means for energy 
savings and occupant comfort. 
Automated shades, either interior or exterior, have higher initial and 
ongoing maintenance costs than nonautomated shades, but, are much 
more energy efficient. So the financial calculation is really a comparison 
of additional lifecycle costs of automation versus increased lifecycle energy 
savings.

78 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
6.4.3  Electrically Switchable Glass
Electrically switchable glass goes by many names: smart glass, smart glazing, 
or smart windows. It is basically glass or coatings that change light trans­
mission properties when voltage is applied. There are a variety of techni­
cal means to accomplish this including electrochromic, suspended particles, 
and liquid crystals.
When voltage is applied to electrically switchable glass the devices or 
coatings change to tint and absorb light. Depending on the underlying tech­
nical means, either a one-time or constant electrical current is needed to 
activate. The coatings or devices return to clear when current is interrupted 
or polarity of the voltage is reserved.
The clear to tint or tint to clear change can occur in just seconds or a 
few minutes depending on the technology. The tint level can be controlled 
manually or automated via integration into a BAS system. The control op­
tions vary with manufacturers; some being able to go from clear to tint back 
and forth, with others having some intermediate levels of tinting. Much 
like the motorized shades, the electrically switchable glass can be manually 
operated via a switch or automated based on light sensors, schedule, occu­
pancy sensors, lighting control or thermostats.
Electrically switchable glass is not new and you may have used or seen 
it. It’s been used in interactive displays in museums, outdoor displays, pri­
vacy glass, projection screens, and in windows on planes, trains, and auto­
mobiles. The rearview mirror in your car may be using one of the underly­
ing technologies in electrically switchable glass.
The issues with electrically switchable glass include installation cost, the 
limitations on the type of windows offered by some manufacturers (i.e., not 
applicable to operative windows), the degree of transparency of the glass, 
switching speeds, and the ability to control intermediate light transmission 
states. Prices on some of the electrically switchable windows are coming 
down as companies’ ramp up their manufacturing to meet what they see as 
a huge potential marketplace segment in energy conservation. 
6.4.4  Automation Issues
The automation issues with shading may seem simple and straight forward, 
but, they are not. There are multiple effects we try to optimize with shad­
ing and they are interrelated. For example, daylight harvesting may allow 
us to dim lights but also affects heat gain, possibly occupant comfort, and 
productivity due to increased glare or brightness. Shading done properly 
reduces the demand for cooling and provides a modification of the lighting 
to a space that improves the amount and dispersal of the lighting. 

6.4  Emerging Lighting Systems 
79
Several manufacturers of motorized shades have addressed this through 
shading management software, which optimizes the position of the shade 
based on multiple criteria. These include sun position, solar intensity, BTU 
Load, readings from indoor and outdoor photo sensors, and radiometers. 
Some software is able to calculate the optimum shade position every 60 
seconds and position the shade accordingly.
There are three systems that need to act in tandem: lighting control 
systems, the HVAC system, and the shading system. The lighting and HVAC 
control systems involve energy consumption, so optimal operation should 
take into account the cost of energy for both systems (i.e., saving money on 
dimming lights versus the additional cooling due to increased heat gain). 
Complexity increases when you start to consider systems schedules, sun 
sensors, occupancy sensors, room temperature, and time of day. Each de­
ployment of automated shading will have different variables to consider, so 
one generic solution is unattainable. The questions to be raised are what 
will automatically trigger shading? Will shading be used with daylight har­
vesting? What level of integration do we need between the systems? And 
finally, if we are to integrate the systems, what is the sequence of operation 
among the three systems?

Data Analytics
Astute facility managers try to extract data from 
building systems and transform that data into 
actionable information in order to better man­
age their building. To most, actionable informa­
tion means trending the data to observe pat­
terns and exceptions or producing enterprise 
reports on energy or alarms. What has emerged 
over the last several years, however, are soft­
ware analytic applications for building systems, 
allowing for deeper and more detailed analysis. 
The basis for many of these software applica­
tions is fault detection and diagnostics (FDD), 
a methodology developed by national research 
laboratories and relevant government agencies. 
FDD has taken actionable information and 
system intelligence to a new level. There are 
now a number of credible companies in the 
marketplace that offer FDD-based tools with 
case studies of implementations that resulted 
in optimal system performance, energy savings, 
and improved operations. For those that under­
stand the return on investment from commis­
sioning building systems and (given the normal 
degradation of the performance of a HVAC sys­
tem) FDD-based software tools, FDD becomes 
a real-time continuous commissioning opera­
tional tool. What follows are a description of 
FDD and some issues in utilizing FDD software 
tools.

82 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
7.1  Overview
While FDD can be used for other building systems, it focuses primarily on 
HVAC systems. HVAC systems are one of the more complex and energy-
consuming systems in a building involving different processes and the inter­
action of different types of equipment. We measure the performance of an 
HVAC system in several different ways: indoor air quality, energy consump­
tion, and thermal comfort.
FDD is based on research of faults in HVAC systems and the develop­
ment of hierarchical relationships and rules between the different equip­
ment and processes that make up the HVAC system. For example, a chilled 
water plant supplying chilled water to air handling units is a relationship; 
the chilled water plant is the single source and the air handling units are 
multiple loads. Another relationship is an air handling unit delivering sup­
ply air to terminal units; the air handling unit is the single source and the 
terminal units are the multiple loads. In an HVAC system this relationship 
between source and load can be via air or water. It is these relationships and 
the rules within the relationships that are at the core of FDD.
These hierarchical relationships are used to collect raw data, apply a set 
of rules and identify faults. For example, there is a set of rules for systems 
consisting of a chiller, a boiler, air handling units receiving hot and chilled 
water from the boiler and chiller, and terminal units receiving supply air 
from the air handling units. A different set of rules would be applied if 
there was staged heating and cooling directly at the air handling unit or for 
single-zone air handling units. There are also different rules for the same 
equipment based on the state of the equipment; for example a chiller will 
have a certain set of rules when it is off, another set of rules at start-up and 
still another during its steady-state. 
An example from the US National Institute of Standards and Technol­
ogy demonstrates how FDD can be applied. In this case it is FDD developed 
for residential split-system heat pumps. The US Department of Energy im­
plemented a regulation in 2006 requiring a 30% increase in the minimum 
seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) for central air conditioners. Equipment 
manufacturers made the improvements to their equipment and at the same 
time NIST’s HVAC&R Equipment Performance Group developed a FDD ap­
proach for residential heat pumps to assess and assure the improvements 
in the equipment. NIST identified six common faults in the equipment: 
improper refrigerant charge, improper indoor airflow, incorrect outdoor air­
flow, flow restriction in the refrigerant liquid line, noncondensable gases in 
the refrigerant and reversing valve or compressor valve refrigerant leakage/
bypassing. They took a look at fault-free and faulty performance charac­
teristics for both heating and cooling modes. The research resulted in a set 

7.2  Issues and Concerns in Implementing FDD 
83
of FDD rules that will be used in the commissioning and the detection of 
sensor failure for residential split-system heat pumps.
In a study on ongoing commissioning (an element of which is system 
diagnostics) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories,  showed an average energy 
savings of 10 percent and as much as 35 percent in some cases. Many of 
the FDD tools go beyond just identifying faults in building systems and can 
provide guidance on what the root cause of the fault may be. This is in­
formation that is valuable to the facility engineer and saves time. Some of 
these tools can also monetize the fault, where there is some indication of 
the severity of the problem or its wasted energy. The monetization of the 
faults tends to rearrange the priorities and urgency of work orders.
7.2  Issues and Concerns in Implementing FDD
Lack of Data: FDD needs data from the BAS systems. If there are not enough 
sensors, the sensors are inaccurate, or the building has a legacy control sys­
tem, there can be issues with obtaining the data required.
Rules Specific to Building Systems: The rules apply to specific HVAC rela­
tionships and equipment, and building owners need to be assured that their 
specific building systems are addressed by the FDD software application or 
can be developed. Many FDD software products start with FDD rules devel­
oped by NIST that are then augmented with rules developed by others or by 
the companies themselves.
How to Handle the FDD Information: Facility Management organizations 
need to decide how best to handle the FDD information. A fault indicates 
that the system may be operational, but, is not performing optimally. Faults 
should not be treated as an alarm. An alarm is a condition meaning im­
mediate response. Faults need to be addressed. Some facility management 
groups set faults aside, study the remedies, and manually prioritize the 
faults. Monetizing the faults helps in prioritizing the faults.
Using the Diagnostic Data: Many FDD-based software tools can provide 
information to the technician or engineer regarding potential corrective ac­
tions. This information should be integrated into the work order system, 
which may be one application in a whole suite of facility management ap­
plications, in order to effectively utilize the information.
Prognostics Data: While FDD seems inherently capable of providing prog­
nostic data (which it can analyze for fault conditions or degradation faults, 
predicting when a component will fail) very little has been developed in 
the area of predictive maintenance. In addition, prognostic data would al­
low for more proactive condition-based maintenance which may be a bet­
ter approach for facility management organizations that are reactive and 
corrective.

84 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
Lack of Applications For Emerging Systems: FDD routines do not currently 
address newer on-site energy sources such as solar, wind or geothermal, or 
touch on power management or demand response.
SaaS and Hosted Systems:  Many of the current offerings are provided as 
Software as a Service (SaaS). This can be an issue with corporate IT depart­
ments because of the need to pierce the IT firewalls and security. However, 
some facility management organizations see it as an advantage because it 
means less involvement and dependence on the IT department.
Alternative Ways to Deploy FDD: At some point in the future control man­
ufacturers will integrate FDD routines into their controllers, starting with 
the large equipment such as chillers. 
Keeping  a significant energy consuming system such as the HVAC run­
ning at optimal performance is challenging. Many times failures or subopti­
mal performance goes unnoticed for long periods of time. Case studies from 
companies vending FDD-based software services can show energy savings 
in the 10% to 35% range with the capability to correctly identify faults and 
the primary response 95% of the time. 
Software based on FDD is a new class of tools for building owners add­
ing some “smarts” to a smart building. It’s not difficult to imagine similar 
tools for other building systems and the potential for enhanced intelligence 
built into tools for facility management.Recently, the best use of an analytic 
software application for building systems has been fault detection and di­
agnostics (FDD) for HVAC systems. There is research including case studies 
with verified results showing that analytic software reduced energy con­
sumption, improved the efficiency and effectiveness of building operation, 
and reduced building operation costs. Once used, FDD becomes a core op­
erational tool for many facility management organizations.
Despite the impressive progress with FDD, the industry is in its infan­
cy in deploying data analytic applications in buildings. If analytics for the 
HVAC system have provided outstanding outcomes, we need to take that 
template to other building systems. Such applications are based on rules

85
of how the system should optimally operate, generally obtained from the 
original design documents, and monitoring key data points in near real-
time. You essentially compare the real-time data with the rules, and if the 
data adheres to the rule, the system is fine. If not, the system is not running 
optimally and has a fault. For those systems that are not process based, ap­
plying analytics generally uses statistical monitoring of key performance 
indicators (KPIs) to monitor outliers. This may not provide diagnosis of an 
issue, but it can identify faulty equipment for preventative maintenance.
7.3  Guest Industry Experts
To get a glimpse of how we could take analytics to other building systems, 
and possibly spark ideas from others, we asked some the best known indus­
try experts to provide examples. What follows is their examples:
7.3.1  Lighting Systems
Mike Welch, Control Network Solutions
The key to analytics for lighting systems is addressable networkable light 
fixtures communicating with an open standard protocol such as DALI® or 
IEC 62386. This allows the acquisition of data and command points which 
can develop into value information. This value information for standard 
lamp fixtures can be as simple as:

 Lamp failure

 LED driver/Lamp Ballast failure

 LED overvoltage

 Mains Failure

 DALI network failure
Figure 7.2

86 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
The more complex reporting would be:

 Run time

 Calculated power per fitting

 Dirty lamp fitting versus lamp fitting failing

 General lamp fixture failure

 Lamp change versus energy consumption cost analysis
There are also analytic opportunities with emergency lamp fixtures. 
These fixtures typically include a lamp with a rechargeable battery pack 
unit, and need to be tested regularly by law in most jurisdictions. While 
these tests are  usually performed manually, networkable emergency fix­
tures can be fully automated, from actually initiating the tests to recording 
results or sending alarms when failures occur. The data that can be acquired 
includes:

 Battery status

 Battery charge level

 Lamp status

 Emergency fixture availability

 Runtime

 Mains Failure

 Network failure
7.3.2  Water System and Conveyance Equipment 
Andres Szmulewicz
For water distribution or irrigation, you would be monitoring power usage 
and gallons per minute (gpm) of the pumps. If you see the kw/gallon drift 
up from historical data for the same gpm (i.e., not just a performance curve 
variance), you know that the pump (while operational) is in need of service 
because it is becoming inefficient.
For conveyance equipment, you would be monitoring the weight load 
sensor, drive power consumption, and travel distance. If you see the kw/
ft.*lb drift up from historical data, you know that the motor (again, while 
operational) is in need of service because it is becoming inefficient.

7.3  Guest Industry Experts 
87
7.3.3  Power Management Systems
Brian Turner, President, Controlco 
There are several other systems in the building envelope that benefit from 
analytics and fault detection, especially when they are integrated into the 
same architecture. Lighting controls and power management are the next 
logical systems to include fault detection. While it is a fact that these systems 
already include some level of fault detection, there is a strong argument to 
be made that including these faults within the context of the building is a 
better solution. 
Lighting control systems often include fault and system alarms for the 
devices and controllers. They rarely have algorithms defined to measure 
how well the sequences are performing, and if the overrides are impacted, 
the overall energy performance of the building. Similar to HVAC, lighting 
sequences and control strategies are customized for the building and tenant 
requirements. It is simply not possible for the manufacturer to predetermine 
what analytics or fault detection algorithms to include in the system before 
the sequences are commissioned. Once the sequences are understood, rules 
can be created that will measure the effectiveness of the sequence as com­
pared to occupancy, HVAC schedules, energy goals, safety, and other related 
and nonrelated data sets. 
Power management is another area of fault detection. Again, the sys­
tem rules cannot be built until the building sequences for HVAC and lighting 
are implemented, and time has passed to build a baseline of information. 
Energy managers largely look at the energy consumption in reports, either 
through dashboards or spreadsheets, to determine if they are meeting their 
energy goals. Analytics and fault detection can be applied to look for the 
same anomalies the energy managers look for, but they do it near real time 
and inform the appropriate energy manager of the situation. If the proper 
systems are in place, additional rules can be  implemented to automatically 
take corrective action to avoid new demand peaks or energy records. 
7.3.4  IT Infrastructure
Jim Lee, Cimetrics
Many organizations have IT infrastructure that is both centralized (data cen­
ters) and distributed (telecommunications/server rooms). Although energy 
efficiency is sometimes considered, especially during construction, the real 
value propositions that matter to the IT departmentare reliability and risk 
mitigation (ensuring uptime). The reliability of the infrastructure depends 
on a number of factors including environmental conditions, power qual­
ity, and IT equipment performance. Fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) 
can be applied to the reliability problem, but it requires the fusion of data 

88 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
from disparate sources such as HVAC, power metering, electrical switch­
gear, uninterruptable power supplies, backup generators, servers, routers 
and switches. Data is collected via SNMP, Modbus, BACnet, and proprietary 
protocols. Today’s servers can provide management data, including internal 
temperatures and computational workload metrics, which are also useful 
inputs to an FDD system. For IT, the benefits of FDD are to predict equip­
ment failures before they occur and to provide insight into the cause of 
failures that do occur. This requires that FDD analytics operate at the system 
level as well as at the equipment level.
7.3.5  Demand Response and Refrigeration
Brian Thompson and Chuck Sloup, Ezenics 
7.3.5.1  Demand Response
Demand Response is reducing or curtailing their electricity use (load) when 
requested by the utility grid during periods of high power prices or when the 
reliability of the grid is threatened. Fault detection is different than demand 
response but can be used to determine if a demand reduction program has 
met its bid/goals. If the customer finds that they are not meeting bid/goals, 
analytics will be able to tell why the goals were not met in order to make 
changes so that the next DR event can be successful. For this to happen, 
building systems that consume energy need to be monitored for correct op­
eration and coordinated in a central location. For instance, monitoring the 
operating modes of a lighting control system in a retail establishment will 
determine if they system is ready for an automated DR event such as shut­
ting off certain lighting tracks in order to reduce load. This automated load 
reduction cannot be achieved if the lighting circuit HOA switch has been 
overridden to the hand position. Therefore the analytics will send a notice 
to the store team to make the correction to make the system ready 
7.3.5.2  Refrigeration
Another benefit of analytics is the ability to monitor systems that are an in­
tegral part of the client delivering the product or service to their customers. 
For instance, monitoring the refrigeration system in a grocery/convenience 
store will determine if the system is working at peak efficiency and effec­
tiveness thereby preventing product loss due to spoilage. The criteria for 
peak efficiency and effectiveness are typically defined by the refrigeration 
case manufacturer. A typical requirement is to achieve a minimum number 
of defrost cycles per day to make sure the evaporator coil can achieve maxi­
mum flow, thereby protecting product from frost buildup.

Analytic software is a new class of tools for building owners, providing 
them real-time analysis and diagnostics of their systems and adding some 
“smarts” to a smart building. As John Petze, Brian Turner, Brian Thompson, 
Andres Szmulewicz, Mike Welch, and Jim Lee have demonstrated, it’s not 
difficult to imagine analytic tools for other building systems and the poten­
tial for enhanced intelligence built into tools for facility management.
Fault detection and diagnostics, like other analytic software tools related 
to building systems, primarily supports technicians and engineers in the field 
who are dealing with everyday operational matters and details of building op­
erations as well as the broader issues of complicated systems, advanced tech­
nology, and higher expectations for building performance. The fault detection 
and diagnostics analytic tools provide insights into building systems that help 
reduce energy consumption, improve building performance and lower costs. 
Fault detection and diagnostics does just what its name implies: It finds 
problems within HVAC systems and offers guidance about solving those 
problems.

7.4  Case Study: Microsoft Redmond Campus
In or around 2010, Microsoft started a project focusing on energy manage­
ment and improved building operations. The project involved the integra­
tion of seven building management systems used on the campus, and the 
deployment of fault detection and diagnostics across its campus. The cam­
pus has 15 million square feet of space in approximately 120 buildings. 
The initial pilot of the FDD application consisted of 2.5 million square 
feet of space, where three potential contractors demonstrated their soft­
ware, prior to selecting a contractor and deploying the application across 
the campus. Although Microsoft benefits from the third lowest utility rates 
in the country, they were able to save over $1 million in energy cost the first 
year from the use of FDD. 
Microsoft invested 10% of the yearly energy costs in the deployment of 
the FDD application, and had a payback of less than 18 months. Microsoft 
previously had a process of recommissioning each of its buildings every five 
years. After one year with the FDD application they are not recommission­
ing each building every year; saving energy, and operational costs.
Table 7.1
Definition of a fault and problems that can be detected with FDD
A fault is a deviation in the value of at least one characteristic 
variable from its normal expected behavior. Faults that can be 
detected through FDD include:
HVAC systems that improperly simultaneously heat and cool
Excessive outdoor air intake and conditioning
Under-utilized free cooling potential
Equipment malfunction (such as broken/leaking valves, broken/stuck 
dampers, sensors out of calibration)
Systems with the wrong setpoints and operating schedules
Unintentional manual overrides
Lack of energy-saving control sequences (such as chilled water reset)
A bad bearing in a motor or compressor (the bearing then can be replaced 
before the whole gear box fails and becomes an emergency repair)
Misaligned motor, rotor imbalance, or cracked rotor bar
Dirty filters or strainers
Incorrect refrigerant or oil levels
Pumps with throttled discharges
Short cycling of equipment
Excessive oscillation (hunting) of control points and/or control loop 
tuning needs
Incorrect fan and pump speeds, pressures, or low flow rates.
Improper building or space pressurizations (negative or positive)
Inefficient boiler combustion
Excessive building peak electrical demand

MICROSOFT Illustrative example of fault detection and diagnosis out­
put (simplified). Microsoft is now collecting 500 Million data point values 
every day, and using that data to create energy and operational savings. The 
company expects to reduce energy consumption by 10 percent. 
The use of analytic software applications have demonstrated positive 
measurable results. A study by Lawrence Berkley Labs titled “Automated 
Continuous Commissioning of Commercial Buildings in 2011, indicated 
30% reduction in building total energy consumption and related costs over 
the baseline; and 30% reduction in building peak demand and CO2 emis­
sions On top of that are operational savings related to increasing personnel 
efficiency and effectiveness; facility engineers and technicians being more 
quickly alerted to a fault in a building system, provided improved informa­
tion on potential system remedies, and monetizing faults to indicate the 
wasted energy. Given their track record, analytic applications have been 
successfully used in lighting systems, electrical distribution, conveyance 
equipment, data centers, etc.

Monitoring Conveyance 
Systems
Elevators, escalators, and moving walkways are 
key equipment that facilitates the movement of 
large numbers of people for public transit, air­
ports, theme parks, large buildings, and other 
venues. Without such equipment, people traffic 
and the related business operations are signifi­
cantly slowed. 
An example of the critical role that convey­
ance equipment plays in the operation of these 
types of facilities is the London Underground, 
where the famous Tube transports over 1.1 
billion passengers per year. The conveyance 
equipment used by the London Underground 
includes 426 escalators (one with a 90 foot ver­
tical rise) and 164 lifts, or elevators. This equip­
ment runs 20 hours a day and is able to handle 
over 13,000 passengers per hour. With that kind 
of volume and traffic, extremely high reliability 
of the conveyance equipment is a requirement.
Relying on complaints from the pubic to 
notify management of an outage in conveyance 
equipment will not result in high reliability of 
the systems. Achieving high reliability  requires 
the equipment to be monitored and managed 
in real time. Such monitoring can provide facil­
ity management with the current status of the 
equipment, as well as the capability to analyze 

94 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
data to discover and predict its performance, use, and the need for main­
tenance. If a facility has hundreds of conveyance systems, it’s going to be 
impossible to keep 100% of them operational at any given time; however, a 
smart monitoring system can get you in the high 90% range.
There are a few key indicators of equipment performance that help in 
managing these conveyance systems. The following are the basic metrics, 
required data, and applications to keep systems running smoothly.
8.1  Wait Time for Elevators 
People hate to wait. If there are long wait times for passengers, there’s prob­
ably a problem with the elevators related to equipment condition or legacy 
controls, such as the use of relays. You need to measure wait times dur­
ing peak and off-peak times and adjust equipment use as needed. Theresa 
Christy, a mathematician at Otis Elevator says that people get impatient and 
agitated after 20 seconds of waiting. Studies show that people overestimate 
Figure 8.1
Figure 8.2  Esclator.

8.2  Elevator Speed  
95
how long they’ve waited in a line by 36%. Remarkably, some building own­
ers that have had complaints of elevator long wait times have determined 
that the complaints are the result of boredom, and have responded by mak­
ing the lobbies more interesting.  
8.2  Elevator Speed 
Elevator speed is important. One needs to periodically monitor the time it 
takes to go from the bottom to the top floor. This is a good metric to mea­
sure and observe to see whether the speed is deteriorating, indicating issues 
with the equipment. 
The speed of an elevator is related to the different type of elevators 
(hydraulic, geared-traction, gearless-traction) and how tall the building is. 
A three-story building using a hydraulic system elevator has a speed around 
100 feet per minute; a geared-traction elevator in a 25 story building may 
be 700 feet per minute; real high rise buildings have speeds over 1,000 feet 
per minute. During the recent renovation of the Empire State Building, 
the speed of the elevators was increased to 20 feet per second to get more 
people up to the observation deck. Passengers now rise 80 floors in about 
48 seconds (without seatbelts).
8.3  Temperature and Humidity in The Machine Room 
Bad affects of temperature and humidity are not related to equipment use, 
but, to the conditions experienced by the equipment controller. Many ma­
chine rooms have inadequate ventilation; they’re too hot, too humid, and 
the outside air is not filtered. You don’t want the elevator drive and control 
system to overheat, fatigue the electronic controls, and possibly increase 
breakdowns. Even if you don’t have breakdowns you’ll shorten the life 
of the control equipment. These rooms need to be treated similarly to a 
Figure 8.3  Moving walkways.

Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
telecommunication room with adequate cooling and air quality, and sen­
sors for environmental and security aspects being remotely monitored.
8.4  Energy Consumption
On the initial industry push for building energy conservation and sustain­
ability, conveyance equipment was pretty much disregarded by the green 
certifications. Generally elevator energy consumption is about 5–10% of to­
tal energy consumption for a typical 5 to 30 floor building, modest compared 
to HVAC and lighting systems, but, still significant. In transit organizations 
and airports where you have hundreds of individual conveyance units, one 
would expect that percentage to be considerably higher. Organizations need 
to submeter the power provided to the conveyance equipment. This al­
lows for understanding  the energy consumption of the equipment, and its 
performance. The energy data can be rolled up into an enterprise energy 
management system and will provide some granularity to overall energy 
consumption of the organization.
8.5  Use Video Cameras
It may seem odd to use video cameras to capture activity of conveyance 
equipment but their use has two benefits. One is that large transit organi­
zations or airports may be liable for accidents involving passengers using 
the conveyance equipment. Video provides a record of what exactly hap­
pened to cause the accident and helps in determining any liability. The sec­
ond benefit is that video can also help in managing the performance of the 
equipment. If the equipment stops or has a fault, video before and after the 
event can be used to help diagnose the problem.  
8.6  Relevant Conveyance Data
The data that can be acquired will be limited by the configuration of the 
controller. Controllers for conveyance equipment are Programmable Logic 
Controllers (PLCs) and are configured using modules for different aspects of 
the equipment. Of course, alarms would be a top monitoring priority. Table 
8.1 shows some basic (nonexhaustive) data that should also be collected.
8.7  Applications
Acquiring relevant data from the conveyance equipment is one thing. 
Transforming the data into useful information is another. It involves identi­
fying individuals or groups within the organization that would be interested 

8.7  Applications 
97
in the information, what their key performance indicators are, and display­
ing the information in a way that a user can perceive the information, com­
prehend its importance, and project what needs to be done based on the 
information.
Typical monitoring applications include:

 Real Time Status of Equipment: This should be an enterprise or sum­
mary view of the equipment with the capability to drill down to view 
a schematic of a particular piece of equipment with all current data 
points.

 Alarm Management: This only works if an alarm management plan is 
developed for how the alarms will be prioritized and classified. Under­
lying the rules should be an assessment of the potential consequences 
of each alarm. For each alarm determine the response of the building 
technician or operator. Identify the roles and responsibilities of each 
person involved in responding, as well as the work process from alarm 
notification to resolution and documentation. Hierarchy rules for esca­
lation should also be included. This application should involve integra­
tion into a work order system.

 Preventative Maintenance: This involves an application with a Facil­
ity Management System. Data on the preventative maintenance of the 
conveyance equipment would be gathered with work orders automati­
cally processed upon key preventative maintenance dates or events.

 Equipment Usage and Traffic Patterns: The system should monitor and 
trend the usage of the equipment by hour, day, and month, and track

this information against the people or passengers using or occupying

the machine rooms, as well as energy consumption.
Once you appreciate the role of conveyance equipment in building 
operations, the monitoring of the equipment will be critical in improving 
building performance.

Positioning Systems
Real Time Location 
Systems
The idea of locating objects and finding people 
in buildings is not new. Back in the 1990s Real 
Time Locating Systems (RTLS) entered the mar­
ket. There are numerous business reasons why 
building owners would want to track people, 
equipment, and materials on their property. 
They may want to better track and manage the 
assets, equipment, and personnel within the 
building, increase the efficiencies and workflow 
of the operations, prevent theft, or improve the 
response to life safety situations. 
For decades, bar codes have been the tech­
nology of choice for ID and tracking. However, 
they can’t be changed, need a line-of-sight to 
be read, have a short lifespan and offer mini­
mal security. Newer technologies offer greater 
data capacities, higher security, tags that can be 
modified, and can be read without line-of-sight 
or contact. They may even be able to integrate 
into existing wireless systems.
Many wireless tracking systems are based 
on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and 
are fairly common. If you have been to a library 
recently you probably have used this technol­
ogy to check out a book. Library books have 
RFID tags. Sensors at the checkout counter or 

100 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
the door sense the RFID tag and the system identifies and tracks the book. 
Walmart and the U. S. Department of Defense legitimized the technolo­
gy and furthered its adoption by mandating its use in their supply-chain 
processes.
Other RTLS technology is based on Wi-Fi. The technology may the basis 
for the RTLS or the Wi-Fi network can be networked with active RFID sys­
tems. The Wi-Fi system uses wireless access points connected to a wired IT 
network and adheres to IT standards using Ethernet and radio frequencies 
standardized by IEEE 802.11. Initially the density of Wi-Fi access points in 
buildings had to be significantly increased to allow the system to triangu­
late the object or person and the Wi-Fi tags. The objects were fairly bulky, 
though there have been improvements to system accuracy and tag weight.
The technology for a RTLS deployment is dependent on how it’s uti­
lized. For large manufacturing or production the use of Wi-Fi may be more 
suitable given the reach, but, if you’re tracking a volume of smaller con­
sumable items, passive RFID Tracking may be more appropriate. What fol­
lows is a description of RFID tracking systems and how they can be used in 
a healthcare environment.

9.1.1  Barcodes
Barcode systems use lasers or cameras to read barcode labels. These systems 
have been around for many years and are less expensive, but, require line-
of-sight access to barcode labels in order to be read. They can be time con­
suming as each label must be found and read. Barcodes are cheap and work 
well, but they require a human being to perform a scan using line-of-sight. 
Figure 9.1

9.1  Tags 
101
The handheld scanners used to read barcodes work well. One of the advan­
tages of barcodes is you scan only one asset. RFID can scan many assets at 
one time.
9.1.2  RFID
RFID (radio frequency identification) uses radio frequency waves to sense 
tags within its read field. An RFID reader emits a signal, which can detect 
RFID tags that contain data. There are many types of RFID tags and read­
ers, which create read fields of widely varying sizes. This can be just a few 
centimeters (nfc), to hundreds of feet (active RFID).
RFID is faster and easier for collecting a lot of data in an automated 
way. Prior to deploying an RFID system, it’s suggested that a building owner 
check the radio frequency in the current environment for conflicts in com­
mon frequency ranges. RFID tags are simply radio transponders. They are 
a small integrated circuit or computer chip which has a very small radio 
antenna built in. In passive systems, the tag does not have its own pow­
er source—it absorbs energy from the system reader antenna that senses 
the tag. The tag has been programmed with its own unique identification. 
When the tag is excited and absorbs the radio waves of the reader antenna, 
the tag sends out its unique identification, which is picked up by the reader 
antenna. Passive tags are typically smaller, less expensive and have a short­
er range. They may be used with low cost assets in retail or manufacturing 
environments.
In active systems, tags have their own power source (battery) and don’t 
need to use the reader’s antenna radio waves to power up and transmit 
their identity. Active tags have a greater range, can store larger amounts of 
data and are larger than passive tags.
Tags come in a variety of sizes and shapes to address a variety of uses. 
The tag can be paper thin to fit inside a book. They also can be direct­
ly mounted onto equipment with an adhesive. Tags can be embedded in 
wrist straps, attached by a pin to clothing, worn on a belt, and even made 
tamperproof.

9.1.3  QR (Quick Response Code)
QR codes are two dimensional barcodes. Scanning can mean sending a text 
message, receiving a hyperlink, dialing a telephone number, or sending a 
message to an email address. QR has two major benefits. First, QR can han­
dle a lot of data (7,089 numeric characters, or 4,296 alphanumeric charac­
ters), and second it can be scanned with a smartphone. 
9.1.4  Readers and Antennas
Readers have an antenna attached to them. Essentially the reader interfaces 
or sits between the wireless portion of the system (the antenna) and the 
headend or system management and administration server. The antenna 
attached to the reader sends radio signals out that activate tags. It listens for 
tags to send a response and once it does, reads the data transmitted by the 
tag and sends it to the reader. Readers can have multiple antennas attached 
to it. The reader can decipher the signal and send the data to the host server.

The host server can have several functions. It can configure, manage, and 
monitor the readers. It can also host specific application software, such as 
card catalogue software for a library’s RFID system. The host system can act 
as a middleman between the RFID system and other software applications 
that a client may have, such as asset inventory, purchasing, patient records, 
or pharmaceutical supplies.
9.2.1  RTLS Healthcare Example
A hospital needs a fast and effective way of finding people (e.g., patients, 
doctors, nurses, orderly, translators, or duty staff), as well as locating key 
medical. The capability to identify persons and equipment in the hospital 
through the use of RFID addresses this need and provides several important 
benefits.
For hospital staff, an RFID chip is embedded into a smart card. Applica­
tions for the smart card for hospital staff include identifying their location, 
access control, point of sale applications, parking garage access, and event 
management. The system would also have the capability to list staff mem­
bers on duty.
The hospital can tag mobile medical equipment. The RFID system can 
quickly locate needed medical equipment saving significant time for staff 
while interfacing into an asset management system.

9.2  RTLS Host 
103
Patients are provided with wristbands with embedded RFID chips, al­
lowing patients to be automatically identified and located. The tags are also 
critical as a security measure, providing an alarm if a patient or infant were 
to leave the hospital premises unauthorized. 
These systems can automatically track and time stamp the progress of 
people or assets through a process, such as following a patient’s emergency 
room wait time, time spent in the operating room, and total time until 
discharge. Such a system can be utilized for quality control and improves 
delivery of services.
9.2.2  Administrating an RTLS
RTLS is a technology system used as a tool for organizations, primarily for 
asset management. There are several business benefits with a current, com­
plete, and accurate facility equipment asset management system:

 By tracking the useful life of assets the building owner can understand 
the return on assets. 

 An asset management system can automatically provide the history of 
the asset including all new work orders on the item in order to assist the 
technician or engineer in repairs and maintenance.

 Building owners can analyze the repair and maintenance of similar 
equipment types or models from different manufacturers to identify 
optimal equipment performance or common problems.
While an asset management system will be utilized by facility staff, 
there are other groups or departments that will need to be integrated as 
well. Purchasing would be involved in receiving equipment and dealing 
with invoices and payments, as well as coordinating the asset management 
data such as date of acquisition. The accounting department also has an 
interest in the equipment assets. Assets may be depreciated or taxed and 
accounting will want to know where the asset is located.
The naming conventions used for the assets (locations, asset categories) 
need to be consistent across multiple departments; without such continuity, 
one could expect increased labor, time, and errors. By using one platform as 
the database for all facility asset data there is opportunity to integrate asset 
data in other databases, such as business operations, human resources, and 
enterprise management performance.
The Data Elements Required in the Asset Database should include:


 Equipment Location



 Model

An example would be Table 9.1.
The major asset classes would be based on asset management groups. 
The naming conventions should have a structure where the facility tech­
nicians should be able to deconstruct the asset labeling convention for 
meaning.
9.2.2.1  Location Tagging 
Asset management should also track locations. Just like assets, one would 
assign a unique location code to each space, building, or a specific part of 
the building. The location tags would have to be uniquely different from the 
asset tags so that scanning tools can recognize the difference. 
9.2.2.2  Applying Asset Tags
If the organization receives an asset from a contractor, the asset should be 
scanned only for the serial number. You affix asset tags to the equipment 
when staging the asset for deployment. This requires that asset tags be 
placed on every asset as soon as it is in the possession of facility staff. Build­
ing owners should minimize the number of people responsible for tagging.
9.3  RTLS and Indoor Positioning Systems
RTLS and indoor positioning systems have many similarities. The differ­
ences in the systems involve the technology used and the purpose of the 
system. Most indoor positioning systems use Bluetooth beaconing. Some 
systems utilize Wi-Fi, but, Wi-Fi is less accurate. The tag used in indoor 
positioning is a person’s smartphone. A ubiquitous type tag may be less 
secure, depending on the mode of communication between the tag and the 
Bluetooth beacon.

Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
The purpose of indoor positioning is to locate an individual or count 
people within a space. You can also use indoor positioning for business pur­
poses. For example, an indoor positioning system in a shopping mall may 
communicate to mall shoppers via the individual’s smartphone with a cou­
pon from one of the retail stores. 
Studies have found that people spend 80–90% of their time indoors, so 
it’s no surprise that one of the most promising technologies for buildings is 
Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS). An IPS is just a data acquisition system, 
obtaining information as to location of people or objects within the build­
ing, providing data to occupants to assist in wayfinding. It has more poten­
tial uses, such as providing valuable information to businesses and building 
owners, security and life safety functions, and yet in some cases present 
some legitimate concerns. 
Many people are familiar with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). GPS 
depends on satellites; its use indoors is affected by roofs, walls, and objects 
in the building resulting in the attenuating, weakening, reflecting, or scat­
tering the radio waves from satellites. While typical GPS may not be suitable 
for indoor, use GPS and indoor positioning systems can be integrated. Also, 
some GPS have enhanced the sensitivity and power of their receivers (high 
sensitivity) and are able to receive some,  satellite signals within a building. 
Indoor Positioning Systems also have some similarities with Distributed 
Antenna Systems (DAS) that boost cell phone coverage in buildings. The 
IPS uses cellphone apps to allow users to navigate through a building and 
can use cellphone capabilities likeBluetooth to locate the cell phone us­
ers. Unlike the real time location systems (RTLS) where corporate users 
(hospitals, warehouses) bought a system, the DAS deployments are usually 
business deals between the building owner and local cell carrier. Building 
owners want to satisfy the needs of their tenants, and the cell carriers want 
to increase usage. It’s likely the indoor positioning systems will involve a 
commercial arrangement similar to DAS. Questions and concerns will arise 
about who will manage the system, who pays for what,  who owns the 
data, who profits,  privacy and security concerns, and who maintains and 
upgrades the system.  
One approach to the IPS architecture  is Bluetooth Beaconing. Bluetooth 
was created in 1994 to replace short cables. Today every smartphone is 
Bluetooth-enabled and we’re all familiar with using Bluetooth to connect 
ear buds, headsets, printers, game consoles, and keyboards. It is the Blue­
tooth capabilities of smartphones together with the Bluetooth beacons that 
can provide the location of smartphone users. In 2010 Nokia introduced an 
indoor positioning system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technol­
ogy (basically the latest Bluetooth technology operating on low power with 
low latency in communications). The density of the Bluetooth beacons is 

9.3  RTLS and Indoor Positioning Systems 
107
roughly the same as a typical Wi-Fi deployment, with accuracy around 0.3 
meters (1 foot), with no latency. 
There appear to be two general approaches for the Bluetooth beacon­
ing: one where the smartphone pulls data from beacons; the other just the 
opposite, where the beacons pull information from the smartphones. Sev­
eral experts believe the first approach is a better plan for privacy and data 
security. The second approach, with beacons detecting the smartphone, 
eliminates the need for specialized software on the smartphones and is pas­
sive for the smartphone.
While Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons may be the most widely 
used technology for indoor position systems, there are other existing tech­
nologies. These include Wi-Fi, which is less accurate that Bluetooth. Newer 
technologies are starting to be developed; these include LED lighting that 
emits modulated light specific to an indoor location, reading the Earth’s 
magnetic field energy, and embedding different sensors in smartphones. 
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth BLE are the most common technologies for most IPS 
deployment. 
The IPS system will use a variety of methods including triangulation, 
signal fingerprinting, and direct association:

 Triangulation: Most people understand that cell towers and GPS de­
termine locations based on the distance between a person and at least 
three radio devices such as Wi-Fi access points or BLE beacons, all of 
which are known locations. The potential issue here is interference; 
walls, and large objects such as equipment. IPS fingerprinting over­
comes the interference problems of triangulation.

 Fingerprinting-based system: This method requires capturing radio sig­
nals, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth beacons, from a smartphone in spaces 
within a building. Each sampling of radio signals in a specific room 
Figure 9.3  Blue beacons.

108 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
creates a fingerprint. Once organized, the IPS can be probed, and the 
system will have the data and analytics to determine the user’s location.

 Direct Association: This method works based on the addresses or unique 
identifiers of Wi-Fi access points or Bluetooth beacons. For Bluetooth, 
an application on a smartphone apprehends this identifier and the IPS 
can locate the device. Wi-Fi networks are a bit different because there 
are multiple access points. Each access point has a Basic Service Set 
Identifier. The Indoor Positioning System uses analytics to determine 
signal strength between any access point and a smartphone to estimate 
the smartphone’s location.
9.3.1  Companies in the IPS Space
Recently twenty-two international companies formed the In-Location Al­
liance to standardize and commercialize this technology. The alliance in­
cludes large multi-national companies such as Nokia, Samsung, Qualcomm, 
and Sony. The list also contains Broadcom, Dialog Semiconductor, Eptisa, 
Geomobile, Genasys, Indra, Insiteo, Nomadic Solutions, Nordic Semicon­
ductor, Nordic Technology Group, NowOn, Primax Electronics, RapidBlue 
Solutions, Seolane Innovation, TamperSeal AB, Team Action Zone and 
Visioglobe. 
Some tech giants, such as Google, are pursuing and developing the 
technology but are not part of the alliance. Apple has is expected to be a 
major player in indoor positioning with their iOS devices as well.
Some of the companies involved in IPS are high tech companies moti­
vated to extend their existing outdoor mapping applications to the indoor 
environment where GPS doesn’t work well due to signal attenuation. In 
addition to extending their mapping applications and advertising revenue, 
the companies have an opportunity to create a treasure trove of data that 
will assist businesses, primarily retail, in identifying customers and in prod­
uct placement.
9.3.2  Where Are Building Owners?
While all of this takes place inside buildings and has the potential to pro­
vide valuable data to building owners it is not the traditional building con­
trol system manufacturers, building operators or facility managers, that are 
driving the IPS deployments. Without building owners’ involvement some­
thing is likely to be lost in this approach, as several beneficial applications 
of IPS can be used to improve building operations. For example, one of the 
key metrics for building management is data on how occupants are us­
ing building spaces. That may include when and where building occupants 

9.3  RTLS and Indoor Positioning Systems 
109
enter and exit the building, what building spaces occupants inhabit, what 
time or day they occupy the spaces, and duration of occupancy. Such data 
can be used to optimize building operations, correlating the occupant data 
to building systems, energy consumption, space utilization, and even utiliz­
ing the data for renovations of existing buildings or design of new buildings. 
IPS could also be part of addressing life safety events, for example, locating 
people for safety or security purposes. With facility management organiza­
tions just starting to wade into the world of data analytics, IPS is posed to 
provide data on a building on a level that hasn’t existed in the past and will 
enrich the analytics of building operations.
IPS technology can be used for almost any size building but appears 
to be particularly well-suited for large commercial buildings, educational 
campuses, malls, airports and guided tours of museums. If you think IPS is 
pie-in-the-sky and way off in the future, think again:
Google launched their Indoor Maps and Indoor Location in late 2011. 
They already have over 10,000 floor plans for a variety of buildings in North 
America, Europe and Japan, and claim 5-10m accuracy inside these build­
ings. Some of the mapped clients include IKEA, MGM Resorts, Mission 
College, Mall of America, Macy’s, Home Depot, and Bloomingdales. (See 
http://maps.google.com/help/maps/indoormaps/).

 Walgreens has a partnership with a startup named aisle411. Any Wal­
green shopper using a smartphone can view maps of any of 8,000 Wal­
green stores and locate products down to the section of an aisle.

 Zonith has an IPS offering also using Bluetooth beaconing, while tar­
geting a different market focusing on security, safety, and situational 
awareness applications. They have an application call Lone Worker, 
which focuses on large utilities, production plants and commercial 
buildings that can locate lone workers and keep track of employees for 
safety purposes.
Some of the applications involve real time location of personnel such 
as doctors, supervisors, technicians, or tracking team members, as well as 
assets on missions in dark or crowded locations. Some companies have also 
used IPS to identify occupancy and adjust energy management systems 
based on where people are gathered.
Case Study—Museums
Many museums around the world are now interacting with visitors and 
patrons by acquiring data on their behavior and providing way-finding 
applications for smartphones. The technology systems utilized include in­
door positioning and eye tracking systems. One example of an IPS and eye 

110 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
tracking trial deployment is at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 
New York. They have installed beacon technology to develop metrics on 
how many people go to a specific exhibition, how long they stay and an eye 
tracking system to determine what people look at and how long they gaze. 
Based on the data developed, the museum then adjusts exhibits, spaces, 
schedules, and donor outreach. In many ways it is an approach similar to 
many retailers and malls; tracking the behavior of their customers to en­
hanced the relationship between the patrons and the museum. What’s hap­
pening at the Guggenheim Museum is similar to other museums in the US 
and around the world.
9.4  Security and Indoor Positioning Systems
Many times we associate IPS with commercial applications, such as retail 
stores and malls, where an IPS is deployed to identify past or potential cus­
tomers and used to entice customers to purchase via texting and discount 
coupons. But IPS has many other uses such as life safety and security, pro­
viding an innovative way to locate and communicate with people inside 
buildings during emergency situations.
The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is look­
ing at indoor positioning to enhance emergency response as well. The FCC 
has suggested a current baseline for indoor positioning for use in emergency 
response. One of the concerns is determining vertical location in a multilev­
el building. An FCC report concludes: “While the location positioning plat­
forms tested provided a relatively high level of yield, as well as improved 
accuracy performance, the results clearly indicate additional development 
is required.”
Life safety situations and emergencies obviously require a more imme­
diate and critical response. These include emergencies, fires, tornado and 
hurricanes, and active shooter situations. For the security industry, IPS is a 
key tool in pinpointing the real-time location of individuals inside buildings 
that help first responders during the incident and also provide information 
to assess the situation after the incident.
In addition to locating individuals, IPS based on smartphones can pro­
vide communications during an incident. Communicating with people in a 
building by first responders and law enforcement assists law enforcement in 
locating a possible shooter. Bi-directional communications can help people 
in the building to be guided to the safest exit passageways. (It is worth not­
ing that over 70 percent of all emergency calls come from mobile phones). 
The indoor positioning system can also be used in conjunction with an Ac­
cess Control System to trigger an alarm notification if a worker or asset en­
ters or leaves certain predefined zones

9.4  Security and Indoor Positioning Systems 
111
Many deployments of indoor positioning systems use multiple tech­
nologies, both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth BLE. Such installations strive for more 
precise and exact locations. Multiple technologies also provide some resil­
iency and reliability in the system. The use of multiple technologies may al­
low for compatibility with a larger spectrum of support for user smartphone 
and tablet devices. 
For  incidents that are occurring with growing frequency in shopping 
malls, office buildings, schools, and even government facilities, hybrid IPS 
technologies combining Wi-Fi and beacons offer the best methodology 
available to protect individuals, reduce injuries, and prevent loss of life.
Hybrid IPS technologies offer the most design flexibility, better accura­
cy, and a lower total cost of ownership—all of which are great advantages to 
organizations that have limited security budgets, yet have a strong need to 
provide a safer environment to customers, personnel, and visitors. Beyond 
that, by leveraging technology that may already be in place, such as exist­
ing Wi-Fi networks or beacons in retail environments, hybrid IPS technolo­
gies are faster to implement and easier to integrate with existing security 
systems. Finally, it makes sense to capitalize on the pervasiveness of mobile 
devices. The FCC is looking at indoor positioning to enhance emergency 
response.
9.4.1  Indoor Maps
Indoor Positioning systems do not work without indoor maps. Facility own­
ers will need to survey their facility and incorporate the maps into the facil­
ity’s app. Maps could be CAD drawings, PDFs, images, high and low resolu­
tion PNG, Shapefiles, SVG, and XML. There’s a new industry creating those 
data. Micello recently announced it had mapped 15,000 indoor venues. 
Google, in addition to collecting its own indoor mapping data is crowd­
sourcing maps from its proprietors. Nokia is collecting indoor data. Mapping 
indoor buildings is being implementedworldwide. 
Some of the buildings in the United States where indoor mapping is be­
ing implemented include:

You may have seen a Google car with cameras and sensors which is 
used to support Google Maps. For indoor space Google has a cartographer 
for indoor mapping. The cartographer uses a process called simultaneous lo­
calization and mapping (SLAM), a technique typically used for mapping new 
locations. As a backpacker walks through a building, the floor plan is auto­
matically generated in real time, Google says. The wearer also uses a tablet 
to add points of interest while walking around the building (for example, 
room numbers in a hotel or the exhibits in a museum).

9.4  Security and Indoor Positioning Systems 
113
 So we track and locate people and objects outdoors in real-time via 
GPS. IPS provides for similar tracking indoors. In the near future it may be 
that there will be few places on Earth where we can’t be tracked and identi­
fied. The key to successful IPS deployments are going to be: (a) users hav­
ing the option to opt in or out of being tracked via a smartphone app, (b) 
thoroughly secured IPS systems, and (c) the demonstration of benefits and 
value for smartphone users, business owners, building owners, and workers 
in emergencies.

10.1  Eye Tracking 
Technology
Eye-Tracking
We use our eyes constantly and how we use 
them is important. The study of human eye 
movement has been around for about 150 years, 
initially performed by simple observation. Eye 
movement is important because what people 
look at and how long they look at it influences 
their decision-making and comprehension. 
Anything with a visual element can be eye-
tracked. Eye-tracking has many applications 
including those for building design and opera­
tion. One example is a company that has sev­
eral mock supermarkets or shopper labs in order 
to track eye movements as people wander the 
aisles of retail stores to determine what items 
or displays catch their eye. Retailers have lim­
ited shelf space and strive to maximize sales and 
profits, so placing items at a certain shelf height 
or in specific aisles is important to catch cus­
tomer’s eyes, as well as exposing customers to 
the highest volume of product. 
Eye-tracking can benefit a building, espe­
cially its interior design, signage, way finding, 
and ergonomics for manual controls and kiosks. 
With eye movement directly related to decision 
making, we’ll start to see more use of research 
in the design and operation of buildings, touch­
ing on the visual structure of the facility, its lay­
out, lighting, colors, and placement of objects 
or controls. Some of the results could include 

116 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
improved productivity in commercial buildings, wellness in hospitals and 
enhanced learning in schools.
Eye-tracking is a component of new building concepts and design. For 
example, with new construction, alternative building facades or spaces can 
be displayed and viewed as three dimensional Building Information Mod­
els. By tracking eye movements and the gaze of design participants (build­
ing owners, occupants, architects, engineers, designers and consultants) the 
information from eye-tracking can provide data on the shape, size, texture, 
color of the façade or spaces revealing what people liked or disliked. Such 
data feedback can influence the façade or space design. Eye-Tracking can 
also complement construction safety, where it is used to identify worker’s 
perceptions of hazards.
Much of today’s eye-tracking technology is focused on commercial ap­
plications. You’ll see eye-tracking used in advertising, software interfaces, 
retail window design, web pages, and almost anything associated with mar­
keting and selling. Much of the eye-tracking is done for prototypes or draft 
products or ads, gathering data on how a consumer interacts with visual 
stimulus to perfect the ad or web page. The basic data evaluates what people 
look at, and how long it holds their gaze. 
There are also beneficial eye-tracking applications that can control com­
puters, monitor automobile drivers or pilots, and even applications allowing 
paralyzed people to operate wheelchairs via eye movement.
10.1  Eye Tracking Technology
Studies show that you can’t simply observe and directly detect what people 
are looking at. Without eye tracking technology, many studies simply ask 
questions and observe the person’s behavior. However eye tracking tech­
nology can generate reliable data. Typical eye tracking technology uses a 
camera and an infrared light source. The light source is directed to one or 
both eyes while the camera follows and records the reflection of the light as 
well as the eye or visual features. While there are other ways of tracking eye 
movements, the use of video cameras sensing reflected light from the eye is 
not invasive and generally inexpensive. 
Typically, an eye tracking project will first involve the relationship be­
tween the eye positioning of the participants, and the scenes are measured 
and calibrated. Each person has to be calibrated via a valid eye movement 
prior to using the eye tracker. The participant must look at a number of cali­
bration spots. Eye-tracking will then generate data. Finally the eye track­
ing data is analyzed and subsequently presented in meaningful framework. 
Eye trackers are primarily looking at the pupils of the eyes, and corneal 
reflection.

10.1  Eye Tracking Technology 
117
Many times the camera is remotely positioned to collect the data, such 
as mounted on a retail shelf or wall. Other methods include a head-mount­
ed eye tracker apparatus. Regardless of the eye tracking method the data 
is collected and analyzed by a computer. This data is used to identify the 
direction of gaze, pupil diameter, eye rotation, the motion of the eye related 
to the head, and blink frequency. Eye tracking will measure the point of 
gaze (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head, 
eye positions and eye movement. There are a number other of methods for 
measuring eye movement. 
The most widely used current designs are video-based eye trackers. A 
camera focuses on one or both eyes and records their movement as the 
viewer looks at some kind of stimulus. Most modern eye-trackers use the 
center of the pupil and infrared light to create corneal reflections (CR). The 
vector between the pupil center and the corneal reflections can be used to 
compute the point of regard on a surface or the gaze direction. 
Software interprets the data that is recorded by the various types of eye 
trackers, and animates or visually represents it, so that the visual behavior 
of a person can be graphically displayed. Graphical presentation and quan­
titative measures of the eye movement events and their parameters can be 
used in the analysis. The main measurements used in eye-tracking projects 
are fixations and saccades. A fixation is when the user’s gaze is relatively mo­
tionless on a specific area. A saccade is a quick movement between fixations 
to another element. There are other eye movement events that stem from 
these basic measures, such as smooth pursuit which allow the eyes to closely 
follow a moving object and blink rate measurements.
Heat maps are the most common visualizations of eye tracking. Heat 
maps are static representations, which can identify where users focused 
their gaze. Heat maps reveal exactly where people look. The results often 
point to useful insights.
Eye tracking generates data regarding what a person views and how 
long their gaze is. This is part of big data where data is obtained, mined and 
Figure 10.1  Eye tracking equipment.

118 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
analyzed. The heat maps show the distribution of attention with a color 
coded map superimposed on the stimulus with an intensity indicator.
The resulting data can be statistically analyzed and graphically rendered 
to provide evidence of specific visual patterns. By examining fixations, sac­
cades, pupil dilation, blinks, and a variety of other behaviors researchers 
can determine a great deal about the effectiveness of a given medium or 
product. 
The most common use of eye tracking is with web sites. Traditionally 
web sites have developed data on clicking and scrolling patterns. Eye track­
ing provides data on what is eye catching on the web site. Eye tracking can 
be used to measure search efficiency, navigation, and usability.
Eye tracking is commonly utilized in a variety of different advertising 
media. Commercials, print ads, online ads, and sponsored programs are all 
conducive to analysis with current eye tracking technology. For instance in 
newspapers, eye tracking studies can be used to find out in what way ad­
vertisements should be mixed with the news in order to catch the subject’s 
eyes. 
One of the most promising applications in eye tracking research is in 
the field of automotive design. Research is currently underway to integrate 
eye tracking cameras into automobiles. The goal is to provide the vehicle 
with the capacity to assess the visual behavior of the driver in real-time. The 
USA National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates 
that drowsiness is the primary causal factor in 100,000 police-reported acci­
dents per year. Another NHTSA study suggests that 80% of collisions occur 
within three seconds of a distraction. By equipping automobiles with the 
ability to monitor drowsiness, inattention, and cognitive engagement driv­
ing safety could be dramatically enhanced. For example, the Driver Moni­
toring System, also known as Driver Attention Monitor, is a vehicle safety 
system first introduced by Toyota in 2006 in its Lexus models providing a 
warning if the driver takes his or her eye off the road.
Since 2005, eye-tracking has been used in communication systems for 
disabled persons: allowing the user to speak, send e-mail, browse the In­
ternet and perform other such activities, using only their eyes. Eye control 
works even when the user has involuntary movement as a result of Ce­
rebral palsy or other disabilities, and for those who have glasses or other 
physical interference. 
10.1.1  Examples of Museums
New York’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum recently deployed an indoor 
positioning system and an eye tracking system. The devices will enable the 
museum to send messages about artworks to visitors via their smartphones 

10.1  Eye Tracking Technology 
119
while at the same time collect details about the visitors. The museum then 
filters the data to better understand guests’ behavior, such as how often 
they visit, which shows they flock to, and what art they ignore.
Understanding audience behavior enables museums to target market­
ing for future exhibits or personalize messages to visitors based on their 
past viewing history. From an educational standpoint, this data can help 
museums find the most effective tools for teaching their audiences about 
the art on the walls.

subscriptions (6.8 billion) as there are people 
on this earth (seven billion). In 2013 there 
were 96 cell-phone service subscriptions for ev­
ery 100 people in the world (information from 
the United Nations’ telecommunications agen­
cy). A subscription doesn’t mean that everyone 
has a cell phone; penetration rates in wealthy 
countries exceed 100% because some people 
have multiple phones and cell subscriptions. 
But even in developing and poor countries, the 
penetration rate of cell phones is around 90%. 
Africa has very few fixed-line telephones with a 
rate of 1.4 subscriptions per 100 people, but has 
63.5 cell subscriptions per 100 people.
Several studies have profiled the use, be­
havior, and bond of a smartphone user and 
the device. A study of 2,000 smartphone us­
ers indicates that the average cell phone user 
reaches for their phone at 7:31am in the morn­
ing, and checks personal emails and Facebook 
before they get out of bed. Incredibly, 40% of 
cell phone users admit to feeling lost without 

122

their device. Another study indicates that the average smartphone user 
checks their phone 150 times per day.
With cell phone penetration around 90–100% and studies showing that 
people spend 80-90% of their time indoors, obviously cell phone coverage 
in buildings is critical. 80% of voice calls and 90% of data usage is indoors. 
Some buildings have a poor quality cell phone signal, with the result be­
ing dropped calls and spotty coverage. Very large facilities, tall buildings, 
facilities with a high density of occupants, and buildings with a steel roof 
or steel/aluminum siding, or brick buildings, as well as concrete and steel 
joists may affect cell signals. Low-E glass windows, which typically are used 
to reduce energy consumption by minimizing the amount of ultraviolet and 
infrared light that can pass through also reflect radio waves and cell signals, 
creating reception issues with in-building wireless coverage.
Other weak wireless situations may be related to a lack of capacity of cell 
coverage where demand cannot be met. These facilities may be large pub­
lic venues such as stadiums, convention centers, corporate offices, multi-
tenant high-rise buildings, university campuses, hospitals, manufacturing 
facilities, upscale hotels and high-rise condos, casinos and federal and local 
government facilities, as well as rail and subway systems.
The major issues with cell coverage in buildings are either weak signals 
from the closest cell tower or lack of capacity. The remedies are different for 
these two problems. Weak signals are typically addressed by strengthening 
the existing signal from the nearest cell site or tower, referred to as a repeat­
er-based solution. This entails an outdoor antenna on the building pointed 
toward the nearest cell tower site. The antenna receives the signal from a 
cell tower and sends it through a cable to a bidirectional amplifier (BDA) that 
strengthens or boosts the signal, then relays and amplifies the RF signal traf­
fic between the remote base station and the mobile radios.
Figure 11.1  Distributed antenna systems.

11.1  DAS Business Model 
123
The issue with increasing cell capacity is typically addressed by install­
ing smaller antennas in the building. These are active systems referred to as 
a distributed antenna systems (DAS). Distributed antenna systems are a net­
work of amplifiers and antennas throughout a facility that are connected 
with copper or fiber cable to a hub. It provides voice and data wireless ser­
vice within a geographic area or structure. 
The headend of the DAS may allow for multiple wireless providers to 
connect radios at various radio frequencies. A neutral host DAS allows multi­
ple wireless providers to use the network at the same time. The DAS essen­
tially feeds smaller cell antennas that cover the buildings’ zones or floors. 
A distributed antenna system may be deployed indoors or outdoors. For 
outdoor DAS, some state Public Utility Commissions have require the utility 
to allow Distributed Antenna Systems in the utility right of way.
11.1  DAS Business Model
Initially wireless carriers deployed Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) to 
expand their service into buildings. The carrier funded, installed, and main­
tained the DAS anticipating increases in their revenues. The carriers real­
ized that their investment in the DAS could be leveraged by leasing the 
capabilities of the DAS to other carriers, thus creating a neutral host DAS.
The deployment of a DAS can benefit the building owner and the wire­
less carriers. With the building having a DAS, the tenants and occupants of 
the building have enhanced cell coverage resulting in reduced complaints 
and service calls. The DAS also improves the marketability of the prop­
erty for the building owner by increasing connectivity and  increases build­
ing safety by improving emergency services. The carriers’ benefits include 
Figure 11.2  Cell tower.

124 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
increased data and voice usage of their wireless networks, leading to ad­
ditional revenues. 
One projection is that DAS installations could grow by 300% by 2017 
(iGR Research). Driving this growth is user demand for ubiquitous reliable 
connectivity, rising bandwidth requirements, and quality of service expec­
tations. The cost for typical DAS systems now range from $5 to $10 million. 
Worldwide distributed antenna system (DAS) revenue reached $2 billion 
in 2013. The major DAS leaders are Commscope, Corning Mobile, and TE 
Connectivity. (Data from Infonetics).
DAS business models vary. In one model the building owner owns the 
DAS and takes on the responsibility for service, maintenance, and upgrades. 
Another option is a third party that could provide a neutral-host multi-car­
rier network; the provider would own, operate, manage, and monitor the 
network relieving the building owner from having to invest in the DAS. A 
third option  is for the building owner and the third party to split the capital 
of the DAS with the third party owning the network and being responsible 
for all maintenance service and carrier relationships.
Generally wireless carriers are hesitant to finance the installation of 
DAS in office buildings and malls, they look instead at larger venues such 
as airports, stadiums, and corporate campuses as they seek to concentrate 
their efforts only on the most high-profile, profitable opportunities. The 
costs to install and operate the DAS networks are significant and typically 
cannot be justified by the wireless carriers from a return on investment 
perspective. The carriers may install and operate a DAS in stadiums and 
airports, but cannot justify it in smaller buildings.
Finally, another DAS variant is the large building which has an anchor 
tenant, often the building owner. The anchor tenant occupies most of the 
Figure 11.3  Multiple antennas in a large building.

11.1  DAS Business Model 
125
building but leases out unused space. The wireless carrier for the anchor 
tenant would probably bring in a single carrier but could benefit from the 
additional revenue for the leasers. Under the terms of most commercial real 
estate leases the building owner can pass through the cost of operating and 
maintaining the building to the tenants in the form of additional rent, com­
mon area maintenance (CAM) or utilities cost, including, but not limited to 
communication systems and other equipment used in common. If the DAS 
infrastructure is paid for by the DAS provider, and the wireless communi­
cation service is sold back to the building as a utility, a commercial lease 
would cover this charge as a tenant utility expense. In these cases the DAS 
provider should be a licensed competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) with 
the transaction structured as a utility easement in gross, with a utility service 
agreement provided by the CLEC for a fixed term. In this scenario the DAS 
provider gets its return on investment and the building owner collects fees 
for utility charges since the tenants are the beneficiaries of the improved 
wireless service.
The business considerations for these models involve: (a) who owns 
the network, (b) who provides the capital, (c) agreements with each car­
rier, and (d) the service level agreements (SLA) for the DAS including their 
scope, quality, responsibilities and a contracted delivery time (of the service 
or performance). Part of ongoing service and maintenance includes changes 
to the building over time due to renovations and space modifications; such 
alternations could affect the performance of the building antennas. Also 
the latest technology changes (such as the recent shift from 3G to 4G) will 
impact updates and changes to the DAS deployment. 
Below are some examples of real world DAS implementations:

 Merchandise Mart in Chicago: When it opened in 1930, the Merchan­
dise Mart in Chicago was the largest building in the world, with 4 mil­
lion square feet. The Merchandise Mart now has a distributed antenna 
system. The system is neutral host, allowing competing carriers to con­
nect their radios and send out their signal. The DAS head-end or central 
distribution is in a 2,000-square-foot space, located on the 18th floor. 
Initially AT&T funded the installation. The leasing agents for the Mer­
chandise Mart use the DAS as a sales point.

 Olympic Stadium in Baku, Azerbaijan: The DAS was installed to sup­
port the first European Games held at the 68,000-seat stadium in 2015.
The DAS supports multiple radio frequencies for three mobile operators 
and ensures that capacity crowds at the Games received strong mobile 
services throughout the event.

126 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings

 Gautrain Railway Systems: Gautrain Railway Systems is an 80-kilo­
metre (50 mi) mass rapid transit railway system in Gauteng Province, 
South Africa, which links Johannesburg, Pretoria, Ekhuruleni and OR 
Tambo International Airport. A DAS was designed and installed in three 
underground Gautrain train stations. One of the challenges for the DAS 
deployment was that construction could not interrupt the train service. 
The master unit is located in one of the three train stations with the 
other two covered by remote units. The project supports both data and 
voice services for Vodacom and MTN subscribers in the Gautrain un­
derground stations at Sandton, Rosebank and Park Stations. The next 
phase of the project addresses wireless coverage and capacity to the 
tunnels via leaky feeder and retrofitting the train cars.
11.2  Life Safety and Emergencies
A building with a DAS can increase the safety of the building’s occupants. 
During an emergency the DAS will enable 911 calls within the building. 
The multiple antennas in a DAS will provide improved communication re­
liability, and provide communications with First Responders, police, and 
fire fighters. Note that two national fire codes, the National Fire Protection 
Association’s NFPA-1 and the International Fire Code were enacted in 2009 
require in-building amplification systems such as a DAS. Such codes have 
been adopted in municipalities across the country.
 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for en­
suring that 911 services and other critical communications remain opera­
tional during emergencies. This includes ensuring communications interop­
erability among first responders and promoting use of enhanced 911 best 
practices. One of the main components is 911 call processing and delivery 
through public safety answering points (PSAP).
 At the PSAP, the dispatcher verifies the caller’s location, determines 
the nature of the emergency, and decides which emergency response teams 
should be notified. However, the use of cell phones makes determining a 
wireless 911 caller’s location more complicated than determining a tradi­
tional wireline 911 caller’s location (where numbers are associated with a 
fixed address.) For callers placing wireless 911 calls, the FCC has required 
wireless service providers to make location information automatically 
available to public-safety answering point (PSAPs). Basic 911 rules require 
wireless service providers to transmit all 911 calls to a PSAP, regardless of 
whether the caller subscribes to the provider’s service or not. The wireless 
service providers have to provide the PSAP with the telephone number of 
the originator of a wireless 911 call and the location of the cell site or base 

11.2  Life Safety and Emergencies 
127
station transmitting the call. Eventually wireless service providers will be 
required to provide more precise location information to PSAP. 
Emerging DAS systems can deploy a self-organizing network (SON). The 
self-organizing network can:
(a)	
Automatically configure and integrate new equipment into the 
wireless network, something akin to plug and play. The net­
work also discovers new components in a system without the 
need for a technician to manually reconfigure the equipment.
(b)	
Automatically optimize the wireless network. It optimizes based 
on data from the system itself. An example of self-optimization 
is the automatic switch-off of a percent of base stations during 
the night which would reconfigure to cover a larger area or a 
significant increase in usage.
(c)	
Self-heal, where the network can identify faults or failures in 
the network such as, base station failure. The network com­
pensates and reconfigures to minimize the impact. 
The DAS network can now move cell capacity from one location to an­
other needing capacity, as well as identify what radio spectrums and func­
tionality are needed on-demand in real-time. While all manner of base sta­
tions will be used in future network deployments, DAS will play a central 
role in providing on-demand capacity wherever and whenever it is needed.
While distributed antennas systems are primarily focused on large ven­
ues and buildings, there are smaller cells available for more modest spaces 
and buildings. These cells are called micro cells, pico cells, or femto cells. 
They are small mobile phone base stations that are connected to the wire­
less carrier’s network via the Internet and typically used in areas where the 
mobile signal is weak. Generally these are very low-range, low-power base 
stations, able to be deployed in a home, home office, enterprise businesses, 
indoor or outdoor public space. Generally the equipment is provided by a 
wireless carrier mobile network operator, and operates in licensed frequen­
cy bands. A base station in a wireless carrier’s network may have a radius of 
2–30 km coverage; the small cells may have coverage radius of 10 meters.

DC Current
While AC current is the worldwide electrical 
distribution system for buildings, we are sur­
rounded by electronic devices and equipment 
that operate internally on Direct Current (DC). 
These devices are plugged into a typical Alter­
nating Current (AC) outlet, but the AC is then 
converted to DC, typically using a rectifier or 
convertor to operate the internal electrical 
components and equipment. A rectifier con­
verts AC, which periodically reverses direction 
to DC, which flows in only one direction. This 
process is known as rectification. Now, many 
newly constructed buildings are deploying re­
newable energy sources such as solar or wind 
which can generate AC or DC power. One of 
the growing uses of DC is digital devices with 
transistors relying on direct current; smart­
phones, personal computers, flat screen TVs, 
and tablets. One example almost everyone can 
relate to is that there are 6.8 billion cell tele­
phone subscriptions that require and consume 
DC power.
According to the director of the Power & 
Energy Initiative at the University of Pittsburgh, 
digital consumer devices and devices such as 
LEDs and solar panels account for up to 20% of 
total power consumption.

130 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
The history of AC and DC power started in the late 1880’s and 1890’s. 
Thomas Edison (who once held the world record of 1093 patents for inven­
tions) developed the first commercial electric power transmission system 
which used direct current (DC). After he deployed about 200 power sta­
tions, a war of currents started. Opposing the use of DC was the inventor 
of transformers and alternating current, Nikola Tesla, and George Westing­
house, a proponent of AC power. Their basic argument was that DC power 
couldn’t be transmitted very far, only around a mile and half, whereas AC 
current could be carried over hundreds of miles and was better suited for 
central power stations. The war of currents got nasty at times but eventually 
AC power won out for power generation, transmission, and distribution.
DC is described as the unidirectional flow of current; current only flows 
in one direction. Voltage and current can vary over time so long as the di­
rection of flow does not change. Alternating current describes the flow of 
charge that changes direction periodically. As a result, the voltage level also 
reverses along with the current. AC is used to deliver power to houses, and 
office buildings.
Converting AC to DC or DC to AC generally results in small conversion 
losses. While the efficiencies of power conversion are dependent on current 
and voltage, conversion equipment is typically rated from 90 to 95% but 
can be much lower. So at best we’re wasting 5–10% of energy in the con­
version and more with multiple conversions using less efficient conversion 
equipment. To minimize conversion losses, the conversion of AC power 
should be upstream of individual devices.
For buildings to deploy DC systems would be a monumental change, 
but, the benefits of a DC infrastructure can be very persuasive. The follow­
ing sections include observations and examples of existing or potential use 
of DC in buildings.
12.1  IT Networks
Most sizable IT networks have for years provided DC power to devices using 
Power over Ethernet (PoE). PoE is an IEEE standard where data commu­
nication and DC power are provided to a device over a four-pair Ethernet 
cable. Most buildings probably already have an IT network or infrastructure 
for DC distribution. The PoE devices typically include IP telephones, Wi-Fi 
access points, video surveillance cameras, access control card readers, and 
remote Ethernet hubs and switches. The use of PoE has gone beyond typi­
cal IT devices and been used in devices such as clocks, gas detection, and AV 
room controllers. 

12.2  Data Centers 
131
12.2  Data Centers
Much of the equipment in a data center such as servers, motors, and batter­
ies use DC power. The power conversions that takes place in a data center 
could include incoming AC power converting to DC at the UPS, converting 
back to AC, then finally converting back to DC within each server’s power 
supply.
A few data centers have gone to a DC architecture where the main 
electrical AC feed into the data center is converted to DC and DC power is 
distributed. The benefits of this approach are threefold: (1) less power loss 
in multiple conversions of AC to DC and DC to AC, resulting in reduced 
energy consumption, (2) less space required by the DC infrastructure for 
equipment and the IT equipment can connect directly to backup batteries, 
and (3) a decrease in cooling requirements. Companies such as Facebook 
and SAP have piloted DC power in their data centers. Japanese telecom 
giant NTT has four data centers in the Tokyo region operating on DC; it 
completed a DC-based server center in Atsugi City, which is its first to serve 
external clients.
A Lawrence Berkley Laboratory (LBL) study indicated a 7% reduction 
of energy consumption and a 28% efficiency gain, comparing DC data cen­
ters to AC based data centers. The LBL study goes on to say “We were 
also able to conclusively demonstrate to the data center industry that DC 
delivery systems are viable, can be 20% or more efficient than current AC 
delivery systems, be more reliable, and potentially cost less in the long run.” 
Efficiency isn’t the only benefit that DC power offers data centers. 
EMerge Alliance representative BJ Sonnenberg, manager of business devel­
opment at Emerson Network Power, says that “DC data center power dis­
tribution equipment is generally more compact, takes up to 33 percent less 
floor space, and can be between 200 to 1000 percent more reliable” than its 
AC counterparts. A study conducted by Validus (ABB) and GE revealed that 
DC data centers should have up to a 36 percent lower lifetime cost.
Figure 12.1  A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating currents (AC), 
which periodically reverse direction to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direc­
tion. This process is known as rectification.

132 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) identified at least a dozen 
new data centers built in the last two years that operate on higher voltage 
DC, a figure that doesn’t include the many central telecom offices currently 
operating on lower voltage DC power. The most powerful DC data center 
built to-date was recently announced by leading power and automation 
technology group ABB and Switzerland-based Green, an information and 
communications technology service provider. The data center is housed in 
Green’s new Zurich-West data center expansion and is based on The Emerge 
Alliance proposed standard 380VDC technology. Up to a 20 percent reduc­
tion in power consumption is expected from grid-to-chip and in cooling.
12.3  Renewables, Electric Vehicles, Storage
The solar panels that have been installed in buildings generate DC or AC.
12.4  Lighting
Compact fluorescent lights with electronic ballasts and light-emitting di­
odes (LEDs) are 25% more efficient than traditional incandescent lighting. 
The benefits of LEDs include longer operating life, less maintenance and 
reduced energy consumption, something on the order of 13% for light­
ing. Use of DC power would further enhance the attractiveness of LEDs by 
eliminating the need and cost to convert AC power to DC as is currently 
done. Several lighting manufacturers have DC based LED systems
12.5  Appliances
Most everyday appliances and electronics operate internally on DC power.

for applications such as refrigeration, ventilation or pumping that are DC­
based are significantly more efficient than AC-based systems.
12.6  DC Power Infrastructure
Armstrong, a manufacturer of fl oors and ceilings has a product called DC 
FlexZone, a ceiling suspension system that provides an infrastructure for 
the delivery of low-voltage DC power based on conventional suspended 
ceiling installation practices and on a 24VDC Occupied Space Standard de­
veloped by the Emerge Alliance, a non-profi t industry organization.
12.7  Standards
The Emerge Alliance, an industry association with industry and research 
institute members is focused on the development of DC technologies and 
standards They have already developed a standard for commercial buildings 
(24 VDC), as well as a standard for data centers (380VDC), and will likely 
implement a standard for residential markets as well.
Building owners, contractors, and engineers will install and maintain 
traditional AC electrical distribution systems in buildings, possibly supple­
mented by solar or wind renewable energy which can generate DC or AC.
One issue with the adoption of DC is that while devices may be inter­
nally powered by DC they are generally manufactured and sold with AC 
plugs/power supplies. In new construction, this issue could be addressed by 
simply procuring new devices that can accommodate direct DC power. With 
existing buildings replacing current equipment with equipment that can 
handle direct DC is likely to be dependent on opportunities during renova­
tions, procurement, and energy conservation strategies. 
At times DC may face implementation issues. Relatively few people 
are experienced with the installation of low voltage direct current. Circuit

protectors, fuses, and insulation materials may need to be redesigned. Prod­
ucts and devices may need to be modified, training and test methods need 
to be developed, and adoption by architects, engineers, and contractors is 
critical.

13.1  POE Overview
Power Over Ethernet
Power Over Ethernet (POE) is probably the 
most under-valued technology in buildings. 
It provides both power and communications 
through one cable; and it can centrally moni­
tor the devices. The devices can be telephones, 
wireless access points, cameras, paging speak­
ers, card readers, lighting, and clocks.
Several major IT manufacturers have de­
veloped software to manage power to the de­
vices, either turning the devices off and on, or 
dimming the power to the device, much like 
a lighting control systems. The POE manage­
ment software essentially enables and disables 
POE ports on a network switch. The result is 
a reduction in peak energy demand for IT net­
works and the flexibility for network managers 
to set different power consumption for different 
IT devices at different times. The POE manage­
ment software is typically a module in a larger 
suite of network management tools, with ca­
pabilities to scale from one network to an en­
terprise. Since the devices that are monitored 
and managed are already on an IT network, the 
monitoring of the devices is done with SNMP 
tools to monitor any device defined by a Man­
agement Information Base (MIB). 
POE truly reduces the cost of building con­
struction and operation. One cable can provide 
power and connectivity, thus eliminating the 

136 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
cost of materials and labor for one additional cable installation. Here’s an 
overview of POE, its uses in products, devices, and systems that are installed 
in buildings, and the reasons why it needs to part of specifications for build­
ing technology systems. 
13.1  POE Overview
PoE was created during the first wave of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) telephones 
and wireless access points (WAP) in the late 1990s. When VOIP and WAP 
were installed two cables were required, one telecommunications cable to 
connect to the data network, and another cable to a local power outlet. 
Older telephone systems that replaced VOIP telephones never required lo­
cal power. Those older telephones were powered from a central telephone 
system, typically a private branch exchange (PBX). Many locations for VoIP 
telephones and wireless access points did not have local power available 
and power had to be installed at considerable costs. So the need for electric 
power for the first VoIP telephones and wireless access points undercut the 
attractiveness of those technologies.
That shortcoming of the VoIP technology spurred the effort to supply 
power to the telephones over the twisted pairs in the telecommunications 
network cable. The result was that in 2003 an IEEE standard was published 
allowing low voltage power, 48 VDC, to be transmitted over Category 3 and 
Category 5 Twisted Pair cable. With the current standard, IEEE 802.af, the 
maximum power that can be delivered to a powered Ethernet device is 15.4 
watts. After counting losses, about 13 watts is the nominal power delivery 
available. Additional losses will occur with the use of switch mode power 
supplies.

13.1  POE Overview 
137
Power is transmitted over the pairs of the Category 5 cable in one of 
two ways. For 1000BASE-T, which uses all four pair, cable pairs must car­
ry both power and data. This method of powering is called Phantom Power 
(Fig.13.3). For 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX Ethernet, which only use two 
out of the four cable pairs for data transmission, the power can be transmit­
ted over the two idle pair. Transmitting the power over idle pair is called I 
(Fig. 13.4).
The device supplying power is called power sourcing equipment (PSE), and 
the device being powered, such as the VOIP telephone or wireless access 
point, is called the powered devices (PD). The PSE determines the method 
(galvanic injection or phantom power) used to power the PD. The PSE can 
either be a POE-enabled network switch (referred to as an endspan) or a de­
vice that injects power between a network switch not POE-enabled and the 
PD (referred to as a midspan). Midspans allow users without POE-enabled 
network switches to make their networks POE-enabled without procuring 
new network switches.
The initial standard is sufficient to power many low powered devices. 
However, the power rating is insufficient to power devices such as video 
surveillance cameras using pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ) capabilities, and video 
telephones. A second standard, IEEE 802, also known as POE Plus, is now 
being developed and will offer higher power levels, although still within 
the low voltage range. Expectations are that the standards for POE Plus 
will at least have a power rating of 30 watts, basically doubling the exist­
ing standard. One concern with the development of the standard is that 
higher power generates more heat on the cable pair(s) resulting in an in­
crease in the attenuation of the cable. The result could be that cabling runs 
would need to be shortened to comply with the standards of TIA 568. Ob­
viously, there is more to come on the development of the standard and its 
implications. 
POE products started with VoIP telephones and wireless access points 
but have rapidly expanded into hundreds of certified products. These in­
clude surveillance cameras, clocks, intercom systems, paging systems, ac­
cess control devices, time and attendance systems, and touch-screen flat 
panels. There’s even a prototype POE electric guitar and a demonstration 
POE electric shaver for men. Here are a couple examples of POoE product 
types that improve the installation and functionality of systems: 

 Access Card Reader: Network connected, POE powered access control 
card readers eliminate the need for a local AC/DC power supply and 
power the reader from the telecom equipment room, which typically is 
on an uninterruptible power supply. 

138 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings

 Paging Speakers: Each speaker is networkconnected and POE powered. 
The speakers become part of a VoIP telephone system, endpoints on the 
system much like the telephones. Thus a separate paging system, and 
interconnection of the paging system and telephone system is elimi­
nated. In addition, the speakers do away with a limited number of pag­
ing zones and allow paging to specific speakers or predefined groups 
of speakers as needed. If your VoIP telephone system is networked be­
tween buildings or cities, so is the paging system and you can page from 
one building or city to the other.

 Clocks: POE clocks plug into the network and become end devices on 
the network much like VoIP telephones or card readers. The clocks can 
be automatically synchronized throughout a facility and managed by 
the network.

 Intercom Systems: Intercoms, which are used in classroom communi­
cations or as part of access control for doors and gates, are evolving to 
networked POE devices. As with many of the other POE devices, instal­
lation costs are lower and system flexibility is increased.
The benefits of PoE are numerous:

 At the top of the list is cost savings or cost avoidance. The cost of a pow­
er outlet includes conduit, wire, a back box for the outlet, and the labor 
of an electrician. If a power outlet does not have to be installed for the 
device, the cost of installation and construction is reduced. Purdue Uni­
versity installed over 1,100 PoE wireless access points across campus, 
and saved $350 to $1,000 per location by not having to install power. 
Others have estimated that an average cost to provide power to a device 
is about $864, while the cost of a POE network port is $47–$175.

13.1  POE Overview

 Increased Reliability: POE centralizes power distribution. Instead of a 
power outlet at each local device, power is now distributed from the 
telecom rooms, (a throwback to the older centralized telephone sys­
tems.) Centralized power makes it easier to provide uninterruptible and 
emergency power for critical hardware, thus increasing system reliabil­
ity and uptime.

 System Management: POE allows the end device to be monitored and 
managed. Network switches provide management tools such as the 
simple network management protocol (SNMP), which allows staff to 
manage the end devices, including the power to the end device. You 
can remotely turn the device on or off or monitor the device’s con­
sumption of power. 

 Move, Additions, and Changes: POE allows for slightly easier building 
renovations and rearranging of spaces since devices only need one ca­
ble. It’s easier to install devices on walls or ceilings, and to setup tem­
porary installations.

 International Applications: POE is being marketed and deployed world­
wide, allowing manufacturers to avoid supplying different power cords 
for different countries and eliminating the need for installers to worry 
about power cords.

 Safer: When POE is used increased low voltage distribution is used to 
power devices, and less high voltage is used throughout a building. This 
results in a safer environment and lower power consumption.
In an environment where construction costs are steadily increasing, 
POE is a technology feature that can add long term value to a building. 
Over one hundred million network ports enabled by Power over Ethernet 
are currently shipping annually. 
The initial POE deployments were providing 15 watts for VoIP tele­
phones. The more recent advances of POE have included Cisco with 60w 
Universal POE (UPOE) technology driving the adoption of virtual desktop

infrastructure (VDI). The HDBaseT Alliance is promoting the POE HDBa­
seT specification for consumer electronics, which can deliver up to 100w 
over twisted-pair cable, supporting full HD digital video, audio, 100BASE-
T, and control signals in television and display applications. Finally, the 
IEEE is developing a standard called IEEE 802.3bt DTE Power via MDI over 
4-Pair which will have remote powering applications and improved energy 
efficiency.

Microgrids
Centralized power plants have been around 
since around the 1880s. A hundred and thir­
ty-five years later we’re starting to see some 
growth in distributed generation of power at 
individual buildings, primarily through renew­
able sources such as solar panels and wind tur­
bines. Between the distinct approaches of cen­
tralized power plants and energy generation 
at individual buildings is emerging something 
called microgrids. With microgrids the real 
estate developers, building owners, or the lo­
cal community build the power grid for their 
large development, industrial park, campus or 
even an entire neighborhood. Microgrids are 
not new and are no longer just a concept. They 
are out of the experimental phase and are now 
commercialized with roughly around 300 mi­
crogrids operational worldwide.
14.1  Overview
Compared to a utility grid, microgrids are small 
or modest sized power generators which may 
include traditional fossil fuel generators, pho­
tovoltaic, wind, or fuel cells. Increased diversity 
of power generation improves the microgrid’s 
reliability. The microgrid may be able to oper­
ate independently (remote villages or military 

142 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
bases), or it could be connected to a larger utility power grid so that the 
microgrid appears as one customer or a provider to the larger grid. The 
organization and management of the microgrid could be a cooperative ar­
rangement for a community, coordinated by developers, or may be a large 
campus with one owner.
Microgrids improve the reliability of the old grid and the overall power 
system. Locally generated power also lessens the burden on existing trans­
mission lines and reduces energy loss in the transmission process. Typical 
microgrid transmission and distribution lines are short and generally any 
losses are negligible. 
14.2  Potential Benefits
In time microgrids will impact each of us involved with designing, con­
structing, operating, and managing buildings. The key question is “Why 
would a developer or building owner be interested in a microgrid?” The 
rationale is persuasive:

 The microgrid improves power reliability. A microgrid with multiple 
generation sources provides diversity and therefore greater reliability. 
Figure 14.1 

14.2  Potential Benefits 
143
Connecting a microgrid to the larger grid simply means increased pow­
er dependability.

 The microgrid has better potential to lower energy costs. While it’s true 
that centralized power plants produce cheap power, there are oppor­
tunities to lower costs with a microgrid. For example, if a microgrid is 
connected to the larger grid the operator can use power from the larger 
grid when prices are cheaper than the microgrid; or conversely maxi­
mize the use of the microgrid when prices from the larger grid are high. 
Given variables such as time-of-day rates, demand charges, weather, 
potential demand response events, and load shedding scenarios, ana­
lytics can be applied to optimize when to use the larger grid or the mi­
crogrid. Eventually this will minimize the cost of energy, or could even 
facilitate making money by selling power into the larger grid. Owning a 
microgrid that is generating power offers more flexibility for the owners 
in managing their energy costs.

 The microgrid is energy efficient. A typical coal-fired power plant might 
be only around 38% efficient; meaning 62% of the original energy is 
not converted to electricity. Add to that another 7% loss in transmission 
and distribution. A microgrid with multiple generation sources is more 
likely to be more efficient through renewable sources, eliminating the 
transmission and distribution energy losses, and having the capability 
to recover and use heat locally. The result is higher energy efficiency 
and lower carbon production.
Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory sheds additional 
light on representing and calculating microgrid costs and benefits. Their 
case study (“A Framework for the Evaluation of the Cost and Benefits of 
Microgrids”) covered a Canadian microgrid with 10MW peak load and a 6.2 
MW average load. They looked at four metrics: the reduction of electricity 
purchased, investment deferral, the reduction of GHG emissions, and in­
creases in reliability. They compared the microgrid to power from the larger 
Figure 14.2

144 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
utility. For reduction of electricity purchase they found the cost of electric­
ity via microgrid to be $5 less per MWh with additional benefits related to 
profits for the owners of the distributed generation in the microgrid (who 
are possibly the customers themselves) including sales of excess power to 
the grid. The load reduction provided benefits to the larger grid related to 
investment deferral; the larger utility company can defer or doesn’t need to 
make a capital investment. There were also substantial benefits to society 
related to reduction of GHGs. Finally, the study monetizes benefits related 
to increased power reliability that accrued to customers, the microgrid op­
erator, and the larger grid. The take-away from this study is that while most 
benefits from microgrids are related to the customer, everyone benefits.
14.3  Developers and Building Owners
A property served by a microgrid that provides more reliable power service 
at a lower cost adds value to the property. Studies have shown that tenants 
will pay slightly more for space that is LEED certified; the same may even­
tually be true for microgrids, maybe even more so because of the explicit 
benefits.
Building owners may also gain by deploying a basic microgrid and pro­
viding or charging for space in a microgrid co-location area for tenants to 
install their own generation equipment. This is similar to data center com­
panies that sell space within their locations to multiple users.
There is now an international standard for microgrids reflecting the vi­
ability, credibility, interest, and momentum of this approach. The IEEE stan­
dard developed in 2011 (IEEE 1547.4) provides best practices for designing, 
operating, and integrating microgrid electric power systems. This includes 
the ability to separate from and reconnect to part of the larger utility grid 
while providing power to the microgrid. This standard addresses engineer­
Figure 14.3 

14.4  Macro versus Micro 
145
ing concerns for microgrids specifically targeting reliability, contingencies, 
and interconnection requirements.
Pike Research anticipates the institutional/campus single owner mi­
crogrids will be the largest segment of growth with 53% of deployments by 
2015, followed by commercial/industrial with multiple owners at 39% of 
deployments.
14.4  Macro versus Micro
One of the unsettled areas regarding microgrids is the role of the larger grid 
utilities, the legacy providers. It’s generally assumed that microgrids will be 
deployed by non-utility developers, probably working for the real estate 
developer, building owners, or the neighborhood. These microgrid entre­
preneurs and developers may offer improved power quality and reliability 
and tailor their services to specific customers.
Some utilities have opposed microgrids due tosafety concerns; others 
support microgrids as long as the larger utility owns, operates, and bills 
customers, an approach that doesn’t necessarily resonant with microgrid 
providers and building owners. Some utilities, such as the Sacramento Mu­
nicipal Utility District have embraced the concept; SMUD is deploying mi­
crogrid architecture in their own corporate headquarters.
The potential utility grid versus microgrid conflict could resemlbe 
changes in the telecommunications industry in the 1980’s and 1990’s. That 
is when the telecom utilities were reorganized and decentralized, followed 
by radically changes due to technological advancements. The result being 
that their primairy business and largest revenue producer—telephone land­
lines for residences—evaporated with the onset of cellular and smartphones. 
There is a significant trend to decentralize some energy generation. You 
see it in individual building uses of renewables and massive efforts to move 
towards net zero buildings. The deployments of microgrids are additional 
evidence of that accelerating trend.
14.5  Generating Revenue from Microgrids
While a few utilities may not support microgrids because they take a portion 
of the load away from the utility, other utilities may welcome microgrids to 
avoid large investments for repairs or upgrades in their transmission system.
The microgrid is an asset. The return on investment of the microgrid 
and the growth in its operating income is important to its financial suc­
cess and wellbeing. Much like typical real estate transactions the location 
of the microgrid is important primarily because of particular state utility 
regulations and policies of the local utilities. Microgrids generally succeed in 

146 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
markets where electricity prices are high, and where there are large dense 
power users such as educational or business campuses or districts. 
Many grid operators buy services from microgrids that are grid con­
nected. Potential revenue stream for microgrid owners include:

 Buying or selling power into wholesale markets, within the rules and 
requirements of some grid system operators and regional transmission 
operators. Owners sell energy back to the utility grid for a profit once 
the selling price exceeds the cost of the microgrid’s generation and stor­
age. 

 Demand response, where the grid operator will pay energy users such 
as the microgrid to curtail energy use. 

 Capacity markets that have been set up to ensure that supply will be 
available when it is needed most. There is an incentive for microgrids 
to make their capacity available to electric markets where price signals 
alone would not work.

 Ancillary services that a microgrid can provide to grid operators. These 
are driven by short term unexpected disruptions in the grid’s overall 
capacity possibly related to a faulty transmission line or an out of serv­
ice power plant, or an intermittent renewable generation capacity like 
wind where resources are required to address inconsistencies in genera­
tion. A microgrid may address the short-term imbalances in electricity 
markets by dispatching resources. 

 Cost savings by avoiding peak energy costs with self-generation and 
storage.

 Microgrid owners may also benefit with declining costs for solar panels 
and energy storage.
Microgrids and distributed energy are viewed as very attractive, be­
cause of reliability, flexibility, and profitability and will grow into an impor­
tant role, providing reliable power at reasonable prices in a sustainable way.

Solar Energy
Imagine a building where the major compo­
nents have photovoltaics embedded in the ma­
terials used in construction; the result being sig­
nificant onsite production of solar power.
We’re all familiar with solar panels on a 
building roof or a parking canopy. Solar pan­
els have been the face of solar energy to date, 
although solar heat can provide energy as well. 
Integrating photovoltaics in a building is some­
thing completely different.
After decades of anticipation, the solar en­
ergy market has created a substantial and grow­
ing movement to integrate photovoltaics (PV) 
into buildings. This approach makes sense; so­
lar energy within the building would generate 
power where it will be used and there is no need 
for any significant transmission or distribution 
infrastructure. This eliminates power losses and 
integrating solar power into buildings doesn’t 
necessarily take up additional land or space.
Integrating solar cells into buildings focus­
es primarily on two aspects. One is the facade, 
which is essentially the exterior of the build­
ing. Facade systems include curtain walls (outer 
walls which are not structural), and spandrel 
panels (a wall between the head of a window 
and the sill of the window above in a build­
ings of two or more floors) and glazing. The use 
of integrated PV in the building skin replaces 

148 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
conventional envelope materials, thus reducing the cost of the integrated 
PV. 
The second aspect of integrated building solar energy is the roofing sys­
tem. This includes tiles, shingles, and standing seam products for steel roofs 
and skylights. For example there are now solar shingles which look like 
traditional asphalt roof shingles, and metal roofing with upwards of 16% 
efficiency.
Besides solar facades or roofs there are innovative products such as 
walkable PV floors, transparent or colored PV glass, outdoor benches, and 
tables. Even the development of solar-powered concrete is underway.
The integration of photovoltaic into buildings may have started with 
the research and development of solar panel windows as a solar collector; 
this is now a reality and is in the marketplace. Wiring is embedded in the 
window frame and can provide direct current (DC) or be connected to a 
central power inverter to convert the direct current from the solar window 
to alternating current (AC) that is then fed into the electric panel for the 
building. This technology shows tremendous potential. Some of the cur­
rent versions of photovoltaic windows can transmit more than 70% of the 
visible light, similar to tinted glass windows already in use in commercial 
buildings. The power conversion for the initial design of the windows was 
low but has steadily improved. One research team calculated that even with 
5% efficiency these windows can generate over 25% of the energy needs of 
a building. Besides energy generation, the windows could also reduce infra­
red radiation, thus reducing thermal loads and operational costs.
The Whole Building Design Guide (www.wbdg.org) states: “PV special­
ists and innovative designers in Europe, Japan, and the U.S. are now explor­
ing creative ways of incorporating solar electricity into their work. A whole 
new vernacular of ‘Solar Electric Architecture’ is beginning to emerge.” 
It’s safe to say that integrating photovoltaics into buildings is innovative 
and will be disruptive for the traditional design and construction industry. 
However, if the approach provides beneficial results including lower energy 
and construction costs, greater utility, scalability, and creativity, building

owners and contractors may see it as an opportunity and be attracted to its 
potential. Integrating photovoltaics into buildings will change the building 
design, with a clear priority of maximizing solar energy products and mate­
rials that can produce a substantial return on investment. 
It is one thing to install a solar panel and quite another to construct a 
solar building. The design and construction of such a building will require 
some reeducation and training of engineers, architects and contractors, as 
well as possibly altering job responsibilities, trades, and skills. One would 
expect that substantial professional industry associations could assist in de­
veloping design guidelines and training.
Integrating solar into buildings makes sense for new construction 
where a building owner, architect, and engineer can design the integrat­
ed PV. This is referred to as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Existing 
buildings integrating photovoltaics are referred to as building-applied photo­
voltaics (BAPV) and are likely to be a more challenging undertaken. Ina new 
or existing building the architect, engineer, or contractor has to evaluate a 
proposed design related to solar access and identify potential use of photo­
voltaic systems. 
Other aspects of designing photovoltaic into the building involve the 
building’s location, its latitude, its structural aspects, nearby trees or build­
ings, shadowing, and average temperatures onsite. These factors must all be 
taken into account during the design stages where the goal is to achieve the 
highest possible value for the BIPV systems. 
The majority of buildings using solar power are connected to a larger 
utility grid because the reality of using solar power for the entire building 
may not be possible. The building owner can operate the integrated solar 
power independently, but, connectivity with the grid provides a backup 
and could present an opportunity to sell power back to the utility. Both 
the building owner and the utility benefit with the grid being connected to 
BIPV. The on-site production of solar electricity typically coincides with the 
peak load times of the utility. The solar contribution reduces energy costs 
for the building owner while the exported solar electricity can help the util­
ity grid during the time of its greatest demand.
The primary disadvantage of solar power is that it clearly cannot be 
created at night or during times of cloud cover. Solar panel energy output 
is maximized when the panel is directly facing the sun. This means that 
fixed locations have a reduced energy production when the sun is not at an 
optimal angle, unlike the solar farms that mount PV panels on towers that 
can track the sun to keep the panels at optimal angles throughout the day.
Solar cells convert about 20% of the sun’s rays to electricity. While 
solar power can be a substantial initial investment, there is minimal main­
tenance, and after purchasing and installation it provides free energy. The 

150 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
capital cost of solar power, batteries, and storage has continued to fall so 
that in many countries solar is cheaper than ordinary fossil fuel electricity 
from the grid. As the price of solar electricity continues to come down every 
year more and more countries will benefit from making the switch to solar 
when new capacity is added. The development of ultra-thin, lightweight, 
and highly flexible solar solutions is a key to the BIPV market.
China, Japan, and the United States have accounted for the majority 
of new solar energy capacity along with growth in Latin America, Africa, 
the Middle East and Europe, particularly Germany. In 2014 solar power 
accounted for more than 55% of new investment in renewable power and 
fuels. Industry analyst firm n-tech Research predicts the total market for 
building-integrated solar photovoltaic (BIPV) systems will grow from about 
$3 billion in 2015 to over $9 billion in 2019, then surge to $26 billion by 
2022, as more truly integrated BIPV products emerge that are monolithi­
cally integrated and multifunctional.
As the cost of solar goes down subsidies will likely disappear. Success of 
BIPV will provide opportunities and major changes, and create new BIPV 
businesses. Manufacturers and construction companies will likely partner. 
The Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) has suggested a need for a solar 
Figure 15.2

151
energy architect, but, a team of systems integrators, construction firms, in­
stallers, manufacturers, and contractors will be needed. 
Interestingly, some researchers think the commercialization of BIPV 
should primarily emphasize aesthetics of the materials and products. Dif­
ferent colors of PV windows would allow some distinct and artistic fea­
tures, though some may want the products to look more traditional (roof 
shingles.) Solar panels on the roof of an old building can be an eye sore, so 
the improved aesthetics of BIPV may increase acceptance of the technology. 
With the PV being embedded in the materials and products no one really 
notices the PV. Smart aspects of BIPV could be automation related to energy, 
system integration, and building energy management systems.
Some important issues related to BIPV include the development of 
building codes and specific standards. Also to be considered are economic 
incentives from local, state or federal governments, optimal system orien­
tations, the service life of the products and materials, their durability and 
capability of withstanding the weathering process, cost, and performance. 
The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast 
that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all 
of the Earth’s non-renewable resources of coal, oil, natural gas, and mined 
uranium combined. Successful deployment of BIPV, combined with energy 
efficiency initiatives, can lead us to the goal of net zero buildings.

Wind Power
The earliest use of wind power was the sail 
boat. Ancient sailors came to understand the 
power of wind. Around 500 AD windmills were 
created to convert wind power into mechani­
cal energy. The windmills liberated people from 
some manual labor and allowed them to pump 
and store water, as well as mill grain from their 
crops by turning stones.
Today’s wind power is generated by mod­
ern wind turbines, a somewhat updated version 
of a windmill. Wind power is considered very 
clean and a major renewable energy source. 
Wind power does not generate carbon emis­
sions, pollutants, or consume water.
The wind turbines convert the wind into 
electricity; the turbine blades are connected to 
an electro-magnetic generator that produces 
electricity when the blades spin. A typical small 
wind turbine may have several blades that 
are assembled atop a steel tube-shaped tower. 
Larger wind turbines may be over 300 feet and 
service a large development or campus. Mul­
tiple wind turbines in a location is called a wind 
farm.
There are some shortcomings for wind 
power. The largest issue is that wind speeds 
can vary throughout the day and year. How­
ever wind power may be used in conjunction 
with other electric power sources to provide a 

154 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
reliable supply; this could include a connection to a utility grid, the use of 
other renewable sources such as solar, and power storage.
Can wind power be used in buildings? Yes, but there are many ques­
tions and serious concerns. Tall buildings are the best candidates because 
wind speed increases with height, but the wind flow is very turbulent on a 
tall building; wind turbines work better with smooth or regular wind flow.
If a turbine is installed on a building it’s likely to be modest turbine, 
resulting in marginal energy production. In addition, noise produced by the 
rotor blades, along with the stresses and vibration of the turbines which can 
be transmitted to the building structure are all serious concerns. There are 
other issues with land use, aesthetic impacts, birds and bats having been 
killed (avian/bat mortality) by flying into the rotors, and obtaining insur­
ance for the turbines.
Some manufacturers are using wind velocities from the building para­
pet or walls but the wind flow is very narrow thus minimizing energy pro­
duction. One could install a wind turbine on a rooftop, although experts 
suggest that a wind turbine be elevated at least 30 feet within anything 
within 500 feet. In addition, rooftops with turbines would have to be quite 
sizable in order to be cost effective. Overall, the idea of a significant wind 
turbine on a building would have a very long return on investment, and 
provide numerous risks and challenges. 
Large commercial wind projects require about 60 to 70 acres of land 
per megawatt (MW), primarily to facilitate and protect wind flow. A small 
amount of the land is for equipment, access roads and infrastructure such 
as conduit, cable, connectivity, and substations. Most of the land is a buffer 
zone to preserve wind flow. 
Some farmers lease their farmland to a wind farm to provide another 
source of income. They can continue to farm the land although wind agree­
ments can create complex legal and financial issues related to the land use. 
Wind-power leases often last 25–50 years. A frequent fear of landowners is 
Figure 16.1

﻿ 
155
that the developer or contractor of the wind farm will default and the land­
owner will be left with large inoperable equipment on the property.
Wind speed is the critical feature of wind resources, because the en­
ergy in wind is proportional to wind speed. In order for a wind turbine to 
work efficiently, wind speeds usually must be above 12 to 14 miles per hour 
to generate electricity. Wind energy is very plentiful in many parts of the 
United States. Good wind resources have an average annual wind speed of 
at least 13 miles per hour. 
Wind turbines are available in a variety of sizes. The largest turbines 
can produce enough electricity to power 1,400 homes. A small home-sized 
wind turbine can supply the power needs of an all-electric home. Single 
small turbines are used for homes, telecommunications equipment, or 
pumping water.
One economic issue for wind is that the cost of solar panels has de­
creased as the solar panels become more efficient. Solar power can now 
produce 60% more power for the same money as wind turbines; obviously 
effecting the value of wind turbines and the overall wind power market. 
One result of this market change is that the U.S. Department of Energy 
has ended their Residential Small Wind Turbines program. The cost of wind 
power has also been higher than conventional electricity generation, with 
a much slower return on investment. Although once the wind turbines are 
constructed, the cost for ongoing operations and maintenance is fairly low.
USA wind power topped 4 percent of the U.S. power grid in 2014 for the 
first time. In two states, Iowa and South Dakota, wind power now exceeds 
25 percent of total electricity production. The United States is recognized as 
a world leader for wind energy production, primarily due to massive capital 
infusion via federal and state subsides, tax incentives and grants, that distort 
the real cost of wind power, with many foreign companies being eligible for 
the subsides. The tax credit for wind is $0.023/kWh. 
Figure 16.2

156 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
The worldwide market for wind energy is growing. The growth year-on 
year is estimated to be 44%. 45% of new wind power installations in 2014 
were in China, which had 110,000,000 homes powered by wind energy 
by the end of 2014 (total capacity 114,609 MW) (source: The Economist, 1 
August 2015). In 2014, the United States represented 17.8% of the world’s 
installed wind power. Twenty four countries have more than 1,000 MW of 
wind power installed across the world; 11 countries have installed more 
than 5,000 MW.

(IBMS)
Integrated Building 
Management Systems
Almost every large building uses a building 
management system (BMS); it’s the major plat­
form for operating the building systems and the 
overall building. However, as we transition to 
more complex, higher performing, and energy 
efficient buildings, it is apparent that many of 
the traditional building management systems 
are not up to the task of monitoring and man­
aging today’s building operations. What are 
the shortcomings of the legacy BMS? The list 
is quite long but the major items include lim­
ited integration capabilities, inadequate and el­
ementary analytic tools, proprietary program­
ming languages, security, a dearth of software 
applications and legacy user interfaces.
17.1  Overview
To some extent, the BMS market has gotten to 
this point because of the business and financial 
aspects surrounding the procurement of a BMS. 
When a traditional BMS is sold and installed it’s 
usually a small part of a much larger invest­
ment. The larger piece of business is the sale of 
building automation systems (BAS) controllers. 
It’s the controllers’ need for ongoing service, 

158 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
repair, parts and possible replacement over time that will generate signifi­
cant recurring revenue for the equipment manufacturer or installation con­
tractor. So the main building management tool, the one that provides the 
user interface for many of the building systems, often takes an inferior posi­
tion to selling and installing the controller hardware. Some manufacturers 
may not put a lot of resources into developing a BMS product that will 
likely be only a very small part of a total sale.
Major BMS manufacturers have made some incremental improvements 
to their products. They may have added an energy management software pack­
age, reengineered an industrial automated process system for buildings, or 
even purchased smaller software companies thinking that would suffice. 
Despite these efforts,building management systems have fallen well short 
of where they need to be.
Part of the problem is that BMS manufacturers have not necessarily 
been good at IT and the BMS is an IT system: it’s a computer server with 
a database, IP addresses and software applications, and connected to net­
works. What has developed at the industry level for building automation 
and IT is just a magnification of what is happening in many facility manage­
ment and IT departments, that is, the readjustment of the roles of facility 
management and IT departments given the reality of the significant pen­
etration of IT into building systems. The movement of BAS manufacturers 
into IT equipment, as well as IT companies into building controls has been 
an ongoing in the industry.
17.2  Escalated Complexity
The drive for improved building management systems reflects the increase 
in the complexity of new buildings. From an equipment or hardware per­
spective we now have buildings with energy and sustainability systemsthat 
were not commonplace even five years ago. These include systems like rain 
water harvesting, exterior motorized shading, water reclamation, renew­
able energy sources, electric switchable glass, and sun tracking systems. 
Figure 17.1

17.3  Specifications for the Future Building Management System (IBMS) 
159
Maintaining and optimizing each of these new systems is a challenge, fur­
ther increasing complexity for building owners and facility management.
Another aspect of increased complexity is related to management deci­
sions regarding building operations that now involve several other variables. 
For example, assume a building manager wants to respond to a demand re­
sponse from the local utility grid, (a voluntary program that compensates 
retail customers for reducing their electricity use). requested by the utility 
during periods of high power prices or when the reliability of the grid is 
threatened. In making a decision on how to respond, the building manager 
has to take into account several financial and operational variables, includ­
ing tangible and intangible benefits and cost. How much power load can 
I shed? How can I shed it? What’s my typical demand profile during the 
time and duration of the event? How do I factor in the need to support the 
ongoing business? How do I implement, monitor, and measure? What’s the 
effect on occupant comfort? How do I communicate to everyone affected 
by the event? Do I forgo the pricing signal to keep the business in normal 
operation? Do I use auxiliary energy generation? What’s the maximum de­
mand I can curtail?
These types of challenges are way beyond the typical question of “What 
should the HVAC set point be?” Obviously, some of these issues can be stud­
ied and a policy can be implemented by the building owner, but, any final 
decision would have to take into account real-time circumstances. This is 
where analytic and automation software tools of integrated building man­
agement systems can support the operations and facility personnel.
17.3  Specifications for the Future Building Management Sys­
tem (IBMS)
Some innovative medium-sized companies around the globe have made 
the first significant steps in providing building management systems that

Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
are beginning to meet today’s challenges in building operations. What fol­
lows is a list of essential functionality of an IBMS:
The platform for the IBMS must be similar to that of smartphones and 
tablets. The base IBMS platform will have an operating system, much like 
laptops and smartphones where third parties provide the applications. That 
model is familiar and comfortable.
The base operating system for the IBMS will do the heavy lifting: ac­
quiring data from different building systems, standardizing or normalizing 
the data into an open or standard database, possibly using something like 
XML/SOAP. This is extensive middleware, where the operating system can 
deal with the BAS communications protocol standards and data formats, as 
well as nonstandard data (i.e., some PLCs), with the BMS fully integrated 
into other facility management systems, such as work order systems, asset 
management, maintenance systems, inventory systems, and incorporating 
data from BIM files.
The IBMS must allow third-party applications for specific manufacturer 
equipment. Given that, every company that manufactures a valve, fan coil, 
sensor, or roof top unit will create an app for their equipment, much like 
they have for product objects in BIM. These apps are likely to be much 
richer in monitoring and managing the equipment and will create a bur­
geoning marketplace. 
Third-party analytic software applications to optimize building perfor­
mance are critical as they keep high performance buildings at peak perfor­
mance and provide a rationale for similar analytics in many other building 
systems. Applications that can consolidate functions across systems, such as 
alarm management and master scheduling will become popular. Building 
managers will be able to test, compare, and  choose the applications they 
need from a variety of third-parties.
The integration capabilities of the IBMS must be extensive. It has to 
go beyond typical fire, HVAC, access control, and elevator integration, and 
progressively integrate any building system, including the smart grid and 
external data such as weather and the financial metrics of energy markets.
The IBMS must be an open and secured system. It requires the tools 
that program the IBMS be transparent so that the building owner has choic­
es in configuring, maintaining, and programming the IBMS. System secu­
rity, which is almost nonexistent on traditional BMS, is a must on an open 
IBMS and probably best dealt with via IT security appliances and software.
The IBMS must be able to data mine and learn a person’s use of the 
IBMS to identify their preferences along with data important to that user. 
Each dashboard is meant to convey important information and key indi­
cators, and requires an examination of the needs of individual and group 
audiences. IBMS analysis of users’ routines, usage, and interactions with 

17.3  Specifications for the Future Building Management System (IBMS) 
161
the IBMS will help to determine what the user needs to see, and possibly 
identify additional analytics and dashboards.
17.3.1  The Benefits of an IBMS
Some of the major benefits of an IBMS include:

 One Management Platform: Large commercial or educational campuses 
have many buildings and some have a separate BMS for different groups 
of buildings. Multiple BMSs on these campuses results in inefficiency; 
facility engineers have to go to multiple locations to monitor and man­
age the building systems. One management platform with internet ac­
cess allows the facility engineer to view any BMS data anywhere, via 
tablets or smartphones.

 Consolidated Data: A single platform with one consolidated database 
has a number of benefits: It provides central control of the data, greater 
access to information, the ability to improve decision making, and ef­
ficient and effective use of resources. It also facilities facility engineers 
to quickly identify potential analytic applications. Data is consolidated 
onto a single system to improve reporting, information management, 
and decision-making. Integrating and managing applications from a 
single workstation allows facility-wide insight and control for better 
performance.

 Improved Security: Overall, the security vulnerabilities of traditional 
BMS systems have not been adequately addressed. Security is likely 
to increase through consolidation on one platform because there are 
fewer endpoints for attack. Imagine someone remotely setting off the 
fire alarm, opening doors, turning off the HVAC controls, accessing a 
Figure 17.3

162 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
video surveillance camera or turning off all the lights in a building. All 
of these are possible life safety or major business disruption issues. The 
IBMS can provide improved security consistent with the best practices 
of IT management.

 Increased Operational Savings: The IBMS is more efficient and effec­
tive. The result is reduced operational costs, a tool to support facility 
staff, and streamlining the process to training facility operators.

 Analytic applications: Most BMS systems provide data on building 
equipment and it’s up to an engineer to analyze and interpret the data. 
Regardless of how talented or knowledgeable the engineer may be it is 
better if a software application can support the engineer in the analysis. 
That is why one of the emerging software applications for large HVAC 
systems is fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) and predictive analyt­
ics. These tools generally support the optimization of the HVAC system 
and can result in significant energy and cost savings. Very few BMS sys­
tems have such sophisticated tools while most of the IBMS systems do. 

 Energy efficient: Real-time view into facility operations and deep trend 
analysis provide data-driven insight to optimize your energy manage­
ment strategies and minimize operational costs.

 Flexibility to grow and expand: The powerful combination of open sys­
tems protocols and a scalable platform means the IBMS can help sup­
port growth and expansion of the system in the future, from one build­
ing, to a campus or world-wide real estate assets. 

 Data is consolidated onto a single system to improve reporting, infor­
mation management, and decision-making. Integrating and managing 
the HVAC, energy, security, digital video and life safety applications 
from a single workstation allows facility-wide insight and control for 
better performance.

 Integration Capabilities: Buildings are more than just HVAC, fire and 
security systems. Most IBMS systems provide integration capabilities 
for many other systems. Some of these offerings will be for other build­
ing systems such as lighting, window shading, and power management. 
Others will be business systems such as accounting or human resources. 
Other information relevant to building management may be outside 
the organization, such as weather data. Overall, the building manager 
needs data from several sources in order to create information and this 
requires integration, not silos of data. Improved or advanced IBMS sys­
tems will need to have middleware software tools to be able to stand­

17.3  Specifications for the Future Building Management System (IBMS) 
163
arde data from a variety of sources and systems into an open database 
structure.

 Integration of systems not only involves obtaining data from multiple 
sources to create information, it also means deriving more functionality 
from the systems working together. That means a sequence of opera­
tions between two or more systems, where an event or condition of 
one system can trigger or initiate actions by other systems. BMS sys­
tems generally do integration between fire alarm, HVAC systems and 
access control, but, the opportunity for other similar coordination ex­
ists. Some integration such as aligning building occupancy with energy 
related systems can have significant payback opportunities. 
Future building management systems will reinvent a lethargic industry. 
It’s also likely to spawn new companies and manufacturers, provide more 
choices for users and the buyers of such products, and do so at lower costs.

The question is not what you look at, but what you see.
—Henry David Thoreau
18.1  Overview
Buildings can generate a lot of data. Much of 
the data is collected through building auto­
mation systems and their data points, sensors, 
meters, databases, and measurements. Each of 
the building systems provide data: HVAC, pow­
er management, access control, lighting, life 
safety, solar panels, structural monitoring, per­
sonnel RFID systems, motorized shades, park­
ing guidance systems, and electrical switchable 
glass. 
However, lots of data does not necessarily 
mean lots of actionable information. Data is raw 
material. Its real value is being transformed into 
useful information where some intelligence 
has been gleaned from analyzing or studying 
the raw product. The final link in this chain, 
and probably the most important, is the user 
interface (UI) or the human-machine inter­
face (HMI), where the actionable information 
is presented to the person who will act upon 
the information. For years the user interface 
was BAS graphics from a building management

Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
system typically used repetitively from client to client and generally had few 
improvements. Today more advanced integrated building management sys­
tems use visualization software. This software can take abstract data and de­
velop images that can aid a user in understanding the meaning of the data. 
Many of the recent building management systems can incorporate popular 
browser-based dashboards to present information to users. This allows facil­
ity management personnel to remotely access data using smartphones and 
tablets and to present information to users.
What follows are some suggestions and guidelines on creating dash­
boards for facility and energy management covering what information is 
needed, how that information should be presented to a user, and a couple 
of industry examples.
18.2  What to Present
Dashboards can provide relevant and timely information to several orga­
nizational levels or groups involved with a building’s performance. These 
different users can be facility technicians, managers, C-level executives, 
tenants, occupants or visitors through kiosks or a web page. The informa­
tion provided may cover the specifics of particular building systems such as 
HVAC, electrical or specialty systems, but. they tend to focus on energy us­
age, costs, KPIs, trends, alarm management, and comparisons with similar 
buildings. So the first and most important step ise determining the right 
information for the intended viewer of the dashboard.
Facility technicians have different information needs than C-level 
executives or the general public. For example, a facility engineer may be 
interested in subsystem alarms and alarm management. In this case the 
dashboard needs to display alarm priority, escalation status, alarm acknowl­
edgment, repetitive alarms, out-of-service alarms and subsystem communi­
cations or component failure. C-level executives, such as directors of facili­
ties, sustainability, or procurement may want information on energy usage 
and cost. In this case the dashboard should display the usage and costs of 
a building’s comprehensive and individual utilities, budgeted versus actual 
utility costs, budget deviations, comparisons with other similar buildings, 
and meter output for alternative energy sources such as photovoltaic and 
wind energy. 
In developing a series of dashboards, you need to identify what insight 
each user or group hopes to gain by using the dashboard, and what infor­
mation at what time interval is needed to support their decision process. 
Dashboards will be fed from data and that data will probably need to 
be collected from several sources: building automation systems, special­
ty systems, and business systems. For example, if you’re creating energy 

18.3  How to Present the Information 
167
dashboard, energy usage may be generated in a BAS, whereas the cost of 
the energy may be in a database in the company’s accounts payable system, 
or real-time data from the local utility. If you’re a healthcare organization 
you may be interested in metrics such as energy use of an MRI machine per 
patient, and need patient counts from business systems. If you are a retail 
company it may be energy use per customer or per sale and you need cus­
tomer and sale data from the business systems.
To gather all the information needed for a dashboard you may need 
a middleware platform to normalize and standardize data generated from 
several sources in different database formats. This would allow a flexible 
and consistent platform for the dashboard, but, could potentially trigger ad­
ditional data management with large amounts of data. Dashboards are typi­
cally used for high-level performance summaries. Some dashboards such as 
analytical dashboards need to drill down to specific data, so data manage­
ment can depend on the specific use of the dashboards.
18.3  How to Present the Information
Dashboards are meant to convey essential information quickly and clearly 
on one screen. Most importantly they do so based on their visual design. 
Visual design is much more than nice graphs and spreadsheets. It involves 
how human beings perceive and act upon visual information, a science in 
the realm of human factors and cognitive psychology. Although this may 
sound like you’ll need a PhD to understand it, it actually is somewhat 
intuitive.
It all starts with something known as preattentive variables. These are the 
attributes of the dashboard that humans subconsciously pay attention to 
before they consciously know they are paying attention (thus preattentive 
attributes.) This innate perceptual and cognitive capacity to pay attention 
unconsciously evolved in human centuries ago. So if you’re designing a 
dashboard to quickly display information, you take into account the preat­
tentive variables to get the user’s attention before they know they’re paying 
attention.
18.3.1  The Position of the Information on the Dashboard
Information can be emphasized or deemphasized by its position on a dis­
play. The visual dominance is the center of the screen. Depending how the 
culture reads (left to right, or right to left) the other area of dominance will 
either be the top left or top right of the screen. The other corners are neu­
tral, or in the case of the bottom right, actually deemphasized. So the most 
important data, such as key performance indicators, has to go in the center 

168 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
or the top left of the dashboard. This is especially true if secondary data on 
the dashboard can only be understood after an understanding of the most 
important information. 
18.3.2  Color
Color is another preattentive variable that can aid in the clarity and quick­
ness of understanding information. Here’s an example of how easy it is to 
pick out data based on the blue color. In fact, if there were many more data 
points, the time needed to scan and quickly pick out the blue data points 
would be about the same.
Our perception of color is relative and dependent on the context that 
surrounds it, so selecting the color of the object and a contrasting color for 
the background is important. There are variations of the use color as a pre­
attentive means, such as color hues, brightness, and color saturation.
18.3.3  Shapes and Sizes
Shapes are also a preattentive variable that, like color, can assist the user in 
quickly differentiating data sets. The size of a shape may be use to convey 
quantities or magnitude. Enclosing a data set in a border or using icons 
to provide meaning or focus attention are also positive uses of forms and 
shapes.
The reason preattentive attributes are important is simple. Dashboards 
should quickly and instantly allow the viewer to grasp the information 
important to the user. Preattentive features are just a head-start on that 
process, providing information to the viewer before the viewer consciously 
knows he or she is paying attention. 
18.4  Industry Examples
Here are a few industry examples of well executed building and energy 
dashboards:

 National Research Energy Laboratory (NREL): This is a Demand Re­
sponse dashboard Enernoc created. It’s one screen with the most im­
portant information in the primary screen position. Viewers can also 
interact with the dashboard to calculate and change timelines. 

 Lucid Design: Lucid is best known for their work in higher education 
and this dashboard addresses electrical use in a dormitory. Note the po­
sitioning, the colors, the user options, and the clarity.

18.4  Industry Examples 
169

 Controlco: This dashboard is meant for a building engineer to analyze 
a system, in this case a chiller plant. It quickly conveys the system data 
points, alarm status and provides options on the left for further infor­
mation.
Dashboards are the end result of a lot of work to identify, gather, and 
standardize data and to clearly understand the roles and the needs of people 
involved with facilities and energy. If they succeed in providing actionable 
information in a timely fashion, dashboards have a positive effect on man­
aging a building’s performance and operation.

Video Surveillance 
Systems
Video surveillance systems are used to deter 
crime and identify criminals when a crime has 
been committed. A video surveillance system 
can monitor stores and stock, provide a visible 
presence that video cameras are used in a build­
ing, allow building management to see what is 
happening at any time of the day, identify exact 
times when crimes have been committed, pro­
vide an identification method by which people 
can be screened before entering a building, and 
allow security personnel to check who is in a 
building at any given time. A complete video 
surveillance system consists of cameras, a con­
trol station, servers, hardware, operator work 
stations, software, cable, infrastructure, and 
junction boxes.
Video surveillance systems should be inte­
grated with intrusion detection, access control, 
and electronic personal protection systems. The 
surveillance system may be comprised of both 
fixed and pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ) high resolu­
tion color cameras for monitoring the perimeter 
and interior of the building.
When we think of analytics related to 
building systems we generally think of predic­
tive analysis or fault detection and diagnostic 
software tools related to HVAC systems. Video 

172 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
analytics, that is software that can analyze and identify people, objects, and 
events in many ways can be just as important in providing information on 
building use and performance. Video cameras can be multifunctional. The 
analysis of digital images addresses physical security, but, goes way beyond 
that to provide data and information for building life safety, energy man­
agement, and overall building performance. This one device, the video cam­
era, has a variety of uses for sensing and gathering data about the building 
condition and performance. This is a good thing, as more high quality and 
relevant building data is critical in generating actionable information and is 
a key to better building management and performance.
If you assume that the video camera is an extension of the human eye, 
the analytical software is the extension of the human brain. Cameras cur­
rently available can detect smoke or fire, identify specific people, detect 
motion, determine if objects have been moved, and provide occupancy data 
including the actual number of people in a space. Generally, if you can de­
velop a pixel template of the event or condition you are trying to track, the 
video analytic software can detect the event or condition.
The video analytic process starts with cameras capturing successive digi­
tal video images of a coverage area. The digital image consists of pixels, a 
contraction of the words picture element and the smallest element of the 
Figure 19.1
Figure 19.2

19.1  Occupancy, People, Counting and Energy 
173
digital image. The analytic software first analyzes pixels, their patterns, the 
adjacency of pixels, the changing of pixels over time, and then compares the 
pixels to a database of templates of objects, conditions, and events. When 
the software gets a reliable match between the digital image of the coverage 
area and its database of templates or conditions, the video system identifies 
an event, state, or situation.
Video cameras are a staple of physical security systems. In the past, 
you typically had a security operations center where personnel viewed the 
feeds from the cameras and subjectively determined whether an event or 
action had taken place that warranted action. One of the largest benefits of 
using analytics in a typical video surveillance security system is improved 
detection and identification of threats, conditions, and events (machines 
outperforming humans). The software is working 24/7 with a constant level 
of accuracy. Also many video surveillance operations are not real time, with 
video simply being archived, available for search and review after an inci­
dent. Even if the system is manned, the attention span of personnel in a 
security operations center is oftentimes very short and inconsistent.
The analytic tools related to video cameras are extensive. As one would 
expect, most are geared towards some aspect of security and they include:

 Facial recognition: Video cameras can be used for recognizing people 
who are then given access to a building or space.The camera can recog­
nize people that may be threats.

 Motion detection: The analytics can detect motion within a camera’s 
coverage area, triggering an alert.

 Missing objects: By comparing digital images the analytics can detect if 
objects are missing or if a new object has been placed in the coverage 
area.

 Reading license plates: The cameras can read license plates to determine 
if particular vehicles have access to parking garage or building.
Some of the more innovative and interesting aspects of video ana­
lytics are people counting for occupancy and using video as a detector of 
fire and smoke. The following section contains an overview of these two 
applications.
19.1  Occupancy, People, Counting and Energy
The simple act of counting people entering or exiting buildings can provide 
very valuable data which can be used in a number of different ways. One 

174 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
of thee primary uses is for energy management. At the core of building 
energy management is an alignment between energy consumption and oc­
cupancy of building space. Getting  data on energy consumption is fairly 
easy through the use of meters or utility billings. Obtaining data on accurate 
occupancy is much more challenging. Aside from retail buildings, very few 
building owners or facility managers have data on the number of people in 
their buildings, a time profile of their occupancy, or the count of occupants 
within the building
The general options for gathering occupancy data are infrared sensors 
around the door frames, people carrying RFID tags, or access control card 
swiping, all of which have potential shortcomings. 
In a video analytic solution cameras are placed above an entrance or 
exit that can detect people and their movement in or out of the building. 
Systems typically collect statistics on space occupancy and variations of oc­
cupancy during the day or by day. 
One example of the benefits of occupancy and people counts is using 
actual people counts at the beginning of the workday to startup and ramp 
up the HVAC system properly. People counting can also be utilized for the 
ventilation of certain spaces. For example, one of the advanced HVAC con­
trol approaches is CO2 demand control ventilation (DCV). Thi is best used in 
large areas, open office spaces, theaters, assembly areas, and ballrooms. A 
CO2 sensor is used to optimize outdoor air use along with the energy re­
quired to condition the air. The CO2 sensor is really a people counter or at 
least a metric that helps reflect occupancy. However detecting occupancy 
through CO2 sensors has its limits, can be unreliable, and provides poor 
estimates of occupancy. People counting technology with accuracy rates of 
95% provides more reliable and accurate estimates of occupancy. Not only 
can you use the occupancy data to improve energy demand, but, the oc­
cupancy data can be used for to evaluate space utilization.
19.2  Video Smoke Detectors
In the life safety area, video analytics capture images and use an algorithm 
to compare the images to a database of smoke and fire patterns. Typically 
these tools are assessing changes in brightness, contrast, motion, and color. 
The use of video in this manner has several advantages. The cameras may 
reduce or eliminate the need for traditional smoke detectors. Also, you can 
use the video smoke detector in spaces where a traditional smoke detector 
may not work, such as vehicle tunnels, high ceilings or in locations where 
the detection device may be exposed to outdoor elements. The first recogni­
tion of video images used for fire and smoke detection was in the 2007 edi­

19.2  Video Smoke Detectors 
175
tion of NFPA 72. (As always, their use should be discussed and approved by 
the local authority having jurisdiction (AHJ), generally the Fire Marshall.)
With typical smoke detectors the smoke from a fire has to move to the 
smoke detector causing transport delay, essentially wasting time to trigger 
the detector. Video smoke detectors have no such delay and therefore are 
quicker resulting in less damage and threat to life. When a fire occurs, mini­
mizing detection latency is crucial to reduce damage and save lives.
While the main purpose of video cameras is physical security, analytic 
software allows for more enhanced applications. In the future we can ex­
pect video cameras to take on the role of building sensors, not only in cal­
culating occupancy, but, sensing other characteristics such as light levels or 
even thermal comfort. Video cameras are the Swiss Army Knife (probably 
the most famous name in multi-tools) of building sensors.

Access Control System
Access control systems are a critical component 
in smart buildings as security has become more 
important. The access control system is essen­
tial for life safety and is interfaced to the fire 
alarm system to facilitate building egress during 
life safety evacuations. Access control systems 
must integrate with several other smart build­
ing systems (video surveillance, HVAC, light­
ing, and others) as well as share data with busi­
ness systems, such as human resources, time, 
and attendance. In a smart building, one elec­
tronic access control system for nonpublic areas 
should be deployed. Within secured areas the 
access control system would provide two levels 
of authentication. The system should support 
offline operation to allow doors to function if 
network connectivity is lost. The access control 
system should be supplemented by an intrusion 
detection system at potential unauthorized en­
trances, such as windows.
The initial access control systems were 
more mechanical than electronic; for example, 
the use of the familiar pushbuttons on a door 
lock that required some type of combination to 
be unlocked. Access Control systems are used 
in a variety of markets and diverse applications. 
Some examples include:

178 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings

 Card access control for building entrances and exits;

 RFID for inventory and asset tracking;

 Pharmaceutical production in order to meet FDA requirements;

 Tracking of inventory and containers at seaports;

 Employee entrances for time card applications.
The access control system should be configured to maximize security. 
For example, its use of vertical transport systems (elevators) can be based 
on occupant identity provide selective access to floors, as well as spaces 
Figure 20.1

﻿ 
179
such as parking garages. Security levels should be determined by individual, 
floor, area, and access privileges can be changed in response to building oc­
cupancy states (i.e., time of day). An access control system can also generate 
anonymous occupancy statistics for building spaces and zones. Such data 
can be used to correlate occupancy to other building systems such as energy 
consumption or lighting schedules. While access cards are generally used in 
many systems, biometric authentication may be utilized for an additional 
degree of security.
One of the largest problems with access control systems can be pig­
gybacking and tailgating. Piggybacking happens when someone with legiti­
mate access to a building allows someone without access to the building 
to enter with them. Tailgating involves taking advantage of someone who 
legitimately has access to the building, where a trespasser enters the build­
ing with a person (or group of people) without their knowledge. One way 
to prevent piggybacking and tailgating is a mantrap shield that uses sensors 
to ensure that only one person is entering the building using one set of 
credentials. Mantrap shields can also be configured with separate compart­
ments so that if more than one person is sensed passing through the first 
door, the second door will remain locked. 
Access systems have leveraged the IT infrastructure, which eliminates 
the need for local AC power by using Power over Ethernet (POE). This con­
solidates the sytem, saves labor cost for cable installation, reduces the time 
to install system devices, and provides a large base of management tools 
and support.
The headend of the access control system uses IT infrastructure to in­
terconnect and share information with a databases residing on other net­
works. The system headend and the door controllers house data regarding 
access credentials. Credentials consist of who gets access to what spaces 
during what hours or days. This data needs to be shared, and interacts with 
databases residing elsewhere such as Human Resources or Student Records. 
Those databases have now moved to open standards for databases such as 
ODBC, SQL, and XML to ease the integration. Data exchange rules between 
access control and other systems would use standard protocols and address 
all physical, virtual and calculated points, and operating parameters.
The access control system monitors and controls facility access via elec­
tronic access controllers utilizing card readers, keypads, and biometric de­
vices. The system can monitor alarm points, control output devices, man­
age elevator control floors, and maintain an operator audit trail of operator 
activity along with access control and alarm activity. The system would 
typically focus on electronic door hardware and integrated devices, but, can 
also manage motorized access gates and associated devices.

180 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
Access control is designed to be activated by an authorized card re­
ceiving a signal from a reader and activate an electronic opening device 
(e.g., electric lock, or gate) to allow access. Should an attempt be made to 
enter this system with an unauthorized card, the electronic device is not 
activated, thus denying entry. This system is also designed to provide for 
an override by the operator locally or remotely to activate electronic door 
devices, allowing access for circumstances not normally programmed into 
the system.
There are codes and standards that cover the installation, performance, 
testing, and maintenance of access control systems. These include: 

 National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 731;

 National Electrical Code (NEC) and applicable local Electrical Codes;


Frequency Devices.
The management and monitoring of access control subsystems uses 
a server with software that provides the interface with the field-installed 
controllers along with the ability to manage the access control database. 
The database consists of the records that determine access privileges, field-
installed controller behavior characteristics, history transactions, and third- 
party interface data. 
One of the key component of access control system is the access control 
unit (ACU), which is an intelligent peripheral control unit that provides 
the interface between the management and monitoring subsystem and the 
devices installed at the access portal for the purpose of restricting access and 
monitoring the portal status. The card reader or a biometric reader captures 
the credential information and passes it to the ACU for processing. 
Many access control cards use the patented Wiegand technology. Wie­
gand is the trade name for a technology used in card readers and sensors, 
particularly for access control applications. Wiegand devices were originally 
developed by HID Corporation. A Wiegand card looks like a credit card and 
uses a patented magnetic principle that uses specially treated wires embed­
ded in the credential card.
�The access control system monitors and controls facility access via 
electronic access controllers utilizing card readers and keypad devices. The 
system shall be capable of monitoring alarm points, controlling output de­
vices, and managing elevator control floors. The system shall maintain an 
operator audit trail of operator activity and all access control and alarm 
activity. Each controller shall be able to manage the hardware necessary 
to secure one door and maintain a full database of information so that ac­
Figure 20.3

cess decisions are made within seconds. Interval data shall be collected at a 
maximum of 15 minutes every day per year. 
In the following sections we will dicuss  four fundamental peripheral 
components in an access control system related to the doors.
20.1  Door Contacts
Door contacts are electromagnetic components that monitor the closed/
open status of the door being controlled. These components consist of a pair 
of electromagnets. Typically these electromagnets are located at the top of 
the door with the passive magnet installed on the door and the electrified 
magnet installed on the doorframe. The magnets align with each other cre­
ating a magnetic field between them. When the door is closed, the magnets 
are aligned and the magnetic field is undisturbed. This position notifies the 
system that the door is closed. When the door is ajar, the magnetic field is 
disturbed and the system is notified that the door is unsecured.
20.2  Request-to-Exit
Request-to-exit (REX) monitors activity immediately inside of a controlled 
door sensing that someone is approaching the controlled door from the in­
side and allows them to exit without activating an alarm. The door control­
ler has an input for each door for the REX. When the REX push button is 
tripped, the door is then open or unlocked.
20.3  Electrified Door Hardware
Electrified Door Hardware allows the door to be automatically locked and 
unlocked by the EAC system. These components can be contained in the 
door or the doorframe. For example, an electric strike will be located in the 
doorframe and an electrified panic bar will be located in the door. Deter­
mining the best method requires an understanding of basic door hardware 
and functionality.
20.4  Readers 
Readers are the devices that interface with personnel desiring access to a 
facility. There are several different types of readers. Some common types are 
Contact Smart Card Readers, Proximity Readers, Swipe Card Readers, Bar 
Code Readers, Insertion Readers, Biometrics Readers, and Key Pads. For 
additional levels or security, it is common for readers to contain a keypad in 
addition to one type of card reader.

20.4  Readers  
183
Proximity Readers are a contactless technology that utilizes RFID tech­
nology operating in the 125 kHz operating frequency. MIFARE Readers are 
also contactless technology that operates at the 13.56 MHz operating fre­
quency. MIFARE technology is primarily used for e-purse applications such 
as vending, fare collection, transit, prepaid metering, phone cards, and toll 
roads.
Access control is a fundamental security concept. Without control of 
access, there is no security. The key is effective identification and authen­
tication of people, via fingerprints, smartcards, and encryption keys and 
to have actions in place to make sure the identity isn’t being used by the 
wrong person.
Given the larger concern for security, its likely advanced technology of 
access control systems will be vastly improved, and access control will inte­
grate with emerging technology such facial recognition, eye tracking, and 
indoor positioning.�

Maintaining High 
Performance Control 
Systems
We rely on control systems to monitor and 
manage our building systems. For the most part 
it’s been assumed that once the control system 
is installed and configured it will work for years 
with little attention and minimal maintenance. 
Some systems may be trouble-free, but, the 
majority of systems will need regular attention 
and maintenance. Over time hardware will fail, 
software parameters change, and the control 
system will drift from its original configuration 
and performance.
The role of control systems is somewhat 
undervalued. When you examine the most 
complex system in most buildings, the HVAC 
infrastructure, you find that it’s the HVAC con­
trol system, not the HVAC equipment, which 
produces the most operational issues and is the 
leading cause of inefficient energy use. Law­
rence Berkley National Laboratories examined 
60 buildings and found the highest frequency 
of common problems with HVAC was in the 
control system. Texas A&M University research 

186 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
determined that of the operational and maintenance measures that could 
produce significant energy savings, 77% of the savings were from correcting 
control problems. Maintaining a high performing control system involves 
regular maintenance, up to date software, data management, and organiza­
tional policies. Issues that cause problems with a building control system are 
the same challenges all of us have had with our computer or smartphone: 
problems related to software, hardware, communications networking, and 
user mistakes. What follows is an overview of some typical control system 
issues along with recommendations on how to keep the system performing 
at a high level.
21.1  Software Issues
Software is probably the number one issue with control systems. Given 
that control systems are networks monitoring and managing data points 
and running control sequence programs, problems with software and data 
management  is not a big surprise. Problems can crop up with the initial 
configuration of the data points in new or replacement BMS systems. In 
existing buildings you may have multiple naming conventions, a lack of 
as-built control drawings, and overall poor data management, making it 
difficult and time consuming to obtain accurate information on point con­
figuration. Even if you get accurate information on the data points, there 
may be human errors in configuring the points in the software.
Beyond the configuration of individual points is the management of 
the control strategy software where both the control logic and appropriate 
parameters must be identified. If the control logic between different HVAC 
equipment is not sound, parameters for set points or ranges for other data 
variables are not suitable, or the space use has changed, you have a control 
system that is providing suboptimal performance for the underlying build­
ing system.
The building management system (BMS) that manages and monitors 
controllers, data points, and control sequences can also be a software is­
sue. Many of the problems are related to the BMS being an IT device. It 
has databases, operating systems, software applications, requirements for 
security, and a need for IT support. With no underlying support from IT or 
a lack of IT expertise within Facility Management, software problems will 
occur. In addition, a typical BMS system also has problems of omission. The 
BMS may not have intuitive graphics, analytic software or any application 
tools to support technicians and engineers in quickly identifying problems 
and solutions. 

21.2  Communications Issues 
187
21.2  Communications Issues
Assuming that the software and hardware of a control system is properly 
working, network communications problems will usually involve cabling 
faults, improper cabling installation, excessive network traffic or the in­
terface into IT network equipment. Cabling can get damaged and network 
connections can become loose resulting in a loss of signal across a com­
munications span. If you’re using wireless technology you can lose contact 
when using an unlicensed frequency and when other equipment using the 
same frequency is introduced into the space, causing interference. 
The interface of a control system into the client’s IT network is another 
potential source of communication issues. This involves cabling into an IT 
network switch, and  possibly additional equipment such as a gateway that 
may be need to translate the control systems protocol and data format into 
an acceptable format for the IT network.
With field controllers where the controller uses an analog signal to 
communicate with the field device, such as a temperature sensor, the issue 
is calibration. A typical sensor may signal output via a range over a DC cur­
rent (4mA to 20mA), identifying the zero and maximum level of the out­
put of the device. These analog communication links need to be calibrated, 
configured, and validated to ensure the controller is getting accurate data. 
21.3  Hardware Issues
At some point hardware devices fail, so every piece of hardware in a control 
system is a potential point of failure and potential problem. At the lowest 
control system level we have devices that provide for communication of the 
monitoring data to the system, with the data usually being a measurement 
Figure 21.1

188 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
or state of a device. These are the typical sensors, relays, and transducers. 
In addition to complete failure of a device (such as a sensor) you can have 
an operating sensor that’s just inaccurate. Sensors need to be recalibrated 
on a regular basis (many organizations calibrate on a regular schedule.) The 
issue here is that the control system may be receiving and acting on poor 
quality data.
At this same control system level are devices that the control system 
is managing and controlling. These are devices such as valve or damper 
operators and variable speed drives. Failure of the device, such as a leaking 
control valve, really negates the control request and overall control strategy 
of the building system.
The controller themselves may fail. This is typically related to the con­
troller’s circuit board, either the components on the circuit board or the 
board’s ability to bond different parts of the board.
21.4  Operator Issues
Operator issues are the human aspect of control systems. A typical example 
would be an engineer or a technician overriding a control parameter such as 
a set point without documenting the change. The override affects the con­
trol system, as well as other engineers or technicians that may be working 
on that portion of the system, but, not informed of the change. This human 
aspect of the control systems plays a part at the larger organizational level 
of a the facilities management department, where the operation doesn’t 
emphasize preventative maintenance, training for its staff, or maintenance 
of the control systems.
21.5  Steps to Take

 Inventory and document your control systems. Identify the location of 
all equipment and the version of the components and software.

 Recalibrate your sensors as well as the analog signals to the field con­
trollers.

 Gather and manage data related to the control systems such as as-built 
control drawings and points list. Don’t wait for an emergency to have 
to scramble to find everything.

 Audit and evaluate the existing controllers for parts availability, service, 
and overall capability.

21.5  Steps to Take 
189

 Develop a step-by-step methodology for troubleshooting. For example, 
you may start with the information from the BMS, check the control­
lers and any IT network involved, which should help in localizing the 
problem. After that you may need some instrumentation to check ca­
bles, communications signals, and voltage or current between a field 
controller and a sensor or actuator.

 Assess the needs of the building owner and operators. If you are deal­
ing with a portfolio of buildings, get a BMS system that can provide an 
enterprise-wide solution rather than managing buildings individually.

 Identify the software applications required. At a minimum you’ll need 
energy management and an analytic application, such as fault detection 
and diagnostics.

 Evaluate whether an upgrade is justified. Take into account mainte­
nance cost on the older control system, and the energy savings and 
potential utility rebates and incentives on the new control system.
The performance level of a building is directly related to the perfor­
mance level of its control systems. One cannot manage a high performance 
Figure 21.2
Figure 21.3

190 
Advanced Technology for Smart Buildings
building without high performing control systems. The importance of main­
tenance of these systems cannot be stressed enough. Regular preventive 
maintenance assures that the control systems and equipment operate well, 
extends the equipment lifecycle, minimizes repairs, and affects energy con­
sumption and occupant comfort.
