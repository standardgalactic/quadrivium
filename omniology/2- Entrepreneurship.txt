Entrepreneurship is a fast-growing and ever-changing discipline. People of all ages, backgrounds, 
and nationalities are launching businesses of their own and, in the process, are reshaping the 
world’s economy. The purpose of this book is to open your mind to the possibilities, the chal-
lenges, and the rewards of owning your own business and to provide the tools you will need to 
be successful if you choose the path of the entrepreneur. It is not an easy road to follow, but the 
rewards—both tangible and intangible—are well worth the risks. Not only may you be rewarded 
financially for your business ideas, but like entrepreneurs the world over, you will be able to work 
at something you love!
Now in its eighth edition, Essentials of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management
has stood the test of time by bringing you the material you need to launch and manage a small
business successfully in a hotly competitive environment. In writing this edition, we have worked 
hard to provide plenty of practical, “hands-on” tools and techniques to make new business ven-
tures successful. Many people launch businesses every year; only some of them succeed. This 
book provides the tools to help teach students the right way to launch and manage a small busi
t
-
ness with the staying power to succeed and grow.
What’s New to This Edition?
This edition includes many new features that reflect this dynamic and exciting field of study.
● One of the first changes you will notice is the addition of Jeff Cornwall as coauthor. 
Jeff, who holds the Jack C. Massey Chair of Entrepreneurship and is Professor of 
Entrepreneurship at Belmont University, is an experienced and successful entrepreneur, 
a dedicated teacher, a respected author, and an acknowledged expert in the field of en-
trepreneurship. The United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship 
has honored Jeff on numerous occasions, naming him a Longenecker/USASBE Fellow 
in 2006 and presenting the center that he headed at Belmont University the USASBE 
National Model Undergraduate Program of the Year Award in 2008. USASBE also recog-
nized Jeff in 2013 with the prestigious Outstanding Educator of the Year award. He also 
served as USASBE’s president in 2010. Jeff’s blog, the Entrepreneurial Mind, is one of 
the most popular small business blogs on the Internet, named by Forbes as a “best of the 
Web” selection.
● Almost all of the real-world examples in this edition are new and are easy to spot because 
they are accompanied by an icon. These examples allow you to see how entrepreneurs are 
putting into practice the concepts you are learning about in the book and in class. These ex-
amples are designed to help you to remember the key concepts in the course. The business
founders in these examples also reflect the diversity that makes entrepreneurship a vital 
part of the global economy.
● We have added a new chapter on “Ethics and Entrepreneurship: Doing the Right Thing” 
that provides you with a framework for making ethical decisions in business and with the
opportunity to wrestle with some of the ethical dilemmas entrepreneurs face in business, 
including the controversial issues surrounding employers’ responses to employees’ post-
ings on social media sites. Encouraging you to think about and discuss these issues now 
prepares you for making the right business decisions later.
● This edition provides expanded and updated coverage of important topics such as using
the business model canvas to refine a business idea; using social media, including 
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, as bootstrap marketing tools; attracting capital using

crowd funding; using “pop-up” stores to test potential permanent locations; and identifying 
the factors that drive employee engagement.
● To emphasize the practical nature of this book, we have updated the content of the very 
popular “Hands On: How To . . .” feature, which selects a concept from each chapter and 
explains how you can put it to practice in your own company. These features include topics 
such as how to “Be a Successful Innovator,” “Use a Mobile-First, Responsive Web Design 
to Increase Online Sales,” “Manage Cash Flow in a Highly Seasonal Business,” and “Make 
Your Small Business a Great Place to Work.”
● Another feature that is popular with both students and professors is “You Be the Consul-
tant.” Every chapter contains at least one of these inserts, which describe a decision an en-
trepreneur faces and asks you to play the role of consultant and advise the entrepreneur on 
the best course of action. This feature includes the fascinating stories of how entrepreneurs 
came up with their business ideas (including one on decoding the DNA of the entrepreneur 
that introduces beekeepers Tim Dover and Susan Gardner, who turned their hobby into a 
successful bee supply business), setting the right price for a company’s custom-made shirts 
in a highly competitive market (direct sales company J. Hilburn, founded by Hil Davis), 
helping entrepreneurs revamp their Web site (New Columbia Distillers, the first new 
distillery to open in Washington, D.C., since Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment 
to the U.S. Constitution), and advising companies on their strategies for becoming micro-
multinational businesses (Zee Wines USA and Somnio, which makes unique running shoes 
that accommodate runners’ foot shapes and running styles). Each one poses a problem or 
an opportunity and includes questions that focus your attention on key issues and help you
to hone your analytical and critical thinking skills.
● This edition includes ten brief cases, eight of them new to this edition, covering a variety 
of topics (see the Case Matrix that appears on the inside cover). All of the cases are about 
small companies, and most are companies you can research online. These cases challenge 
you to think critically about a variety of topics that are covered in the text—from develop-
ing a business strategy and building a brand to protecting intellectual property and financ-
ing a business.
● The content of every chapter reflects the most recent statistics, studies, surveys, and
research about entrepreneurship and small business management. You will learn how to 
launch and manage a business the right way by studying the most current concepts in
t
entrepreneurship and small business management.
Entrepreneurship has become a major force in the global economy. Policymakers across the 
world are discovering that economic growth and prosperity lie in the hands of entrepreneurs—
those dynamic, driven men and women who are committed to achieving success by creating and 
marketing innovative, customer-focused new products and services. Not only are these entrepre-
neurs creating economic prosperity, but as social entrepreneurs, many of them are also striving 
to make the world a better place in which to live. Those who possess this spirit of entrepreneurial 
leadership continue to lead the economic revolution that has proved time and again its ability to 
raise the standard of living for people everywhere. We hope that by using this book in your small 
business management or entrepreneurship class, you will join this economic revolution to bring 
about lasting, positive changes in your community and around the world. If you are interested in 
launching a business of your own, Essentials of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Manage-
ment is the ideal book for you!
t
This eighth edition of Essentials of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management
introduces you to the process of creating a new venture and provides you with the knowledge you 
need to launch a business that has the greatest chance for success. One of the hallmarks of every
edition of this book has been a very practical, “hands-on” approach to entrepreneurship. We 
strive to equip you with the tools you will need for entrepreneurial success. By combining this 
textbook with your professor’s expertise, you will be equipped to follow your dream of becoming 
a successful entrepreneur.

Other Text Features
● This edition once again emphasizes the importance of conducting a feasibility analysis 
and creating a business plan for a successful new venture. Chapter 4 offers comprehensive
coverage of how to conduct a feasibility study for a business idea and then how to create a 
sound business model for the ideas that pass the feasibility test.
● This edition features an updated, attractive, full-color design and a user-friendly layout 
that includes an in-margin glossary and learning objectives. Each chapter begins with 
learning objectives, which are repeated as in-margin markers within the chapter to guide 
you as you study.
● Chapter 3, “Inside the Entrepreneurial Mind: From Ideas to Reality,” explains the creative 
process entrepreneurs use to generate business ideas and to recognize entrepreneurial 
opportunities. This chapter helps you learn to think like an entrepreneur.
● Chapter 9, “E-Commerce and the Entrepreneur,” serves as a practical guide to using the
Internet as a marketing and business tool and offers helpful advice for engaging success-
fully in mobile commerce.
● Chapter 13, “Sources of Financing: Equity and Debt,” gives you a useful overview of the 
various financing sources that are available to entrepreneurs with plenty of practical advice 
for landing the financing you need to start or grow your business. Given the changes that 
have resulted from recent turmoil in the financial industry, this is a particularly important 
chapter.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
The World of the Entrepreneur
Welcome to the world of the entrepreneur! Around the world, growing numbers of people are
realizing their dreams of owning and operating their own businesses. Entrepreneurship con-
tinues to thrive in nearly every corner of the world. Globally, one in eight adults is actively 
engaged in launching a business.1 Research by the Kauffman Foundation shows that in the United 
States alone, entrepreneurs launch 476,000 businesses each month.2 This entrepreneurial spirit 
is the most significant economic development in recent business history. In the United States
and around the globe, these heroes of the new economy are reshaping the business environment 
and creating a world in which their companies play an important role in the vitality of the global 
economy. With amazing vigor, their businesses have introduced innovative products and services, 
pushed back technological frontiers, created new jobs, opened foreign markets, and, in the pro-
cess, provided their founders with the opportunity to do what they enjoy most. “Small businesses
have been at the core of our economy’s growth over the last few years,” says Winslow Sargeant, 
chief counsel of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy.3
Entrepreneurial activity is essential to a strong global economy. Many of the world’s largest 
companies continue to engage in massive downsizing campaigns, dramatically cutting the num-
ber of employees on their payrolls. This flurry of “pink slips” has spawned a new population of 
entrepreneurs: “castoffs” from large corporations (in which many of these individuals thought 
they would be lifetime ladder climbers) with solid management experience and many productive 
years left before retirement. According to the Small Business Administration, during a recent 
one-year period, the largest companies in the United States (those with 500 or more employees) 
shed 1.7 million net jobs; during the same period, small businesses with fewer than 20 employees
d
created 287,000 net jobs!
d
4
One casualty of this downsizing has been the long-standing notion of job security in large 
corporations. As a result, many people no longer see launching a business as a risky career path. 
Having been victims of downsizing or having witnessed large companies execute layoffs with 
detached precision, these people see entrepreneurship as the ideal way to create their own job 
security and success. Rather than pursue corporate careers after graduation, many college stu-
dents are choosing to launch companies of their own. They prefer to control their own destinies 
by building their own businesses.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Christopher Kelley: Badd Newz BBQ For years, 
Christopher Kelley had dreamed of becoming a mobile restaurateur by launching a food
truck that specialized in barbecue but was hesitant to give up the security of his job at the com-
pany where he had worked in maintenance for 14 years. Like many entrepreneurs, Kelley refused
to give up on his dream, bought a food truck, outfitted it, and started Bad Newz BBQ as a part-
time business, catering local school events, church gatherings, and fundraisers in Huntsville, 
Alabama. Two months later, Kelley’s employer announced a massive layoff, and Kelley’s job was
eliminated. The layoff prompted Kelley to transform Bad Newz BBQ into a full-time business, and 
he began marketing his food truck via social and traditional media, even landing a regular spot at
a nearby army post. Kelly, who is 43 years old and has lost three jobs over the last 20 years to
layoffs, decided it was time to take control of his own destiny by starting a business. He advises 
other entrepreneurs to believe in their abilities even when others do not and to devote all of their 
energy into building a successful business.5 ■
The downsizing trend among large companies has created a more significant philosophical 
change. It has ushered in an age in which “small is beautiful.” Twenty-five years ago, competitive 
conditions favored large companies with their hierarchies and layers of management; today, with 
the pace of change constantly accelerating, fleet-footed, agile, small companies have the compet-
itive advantage. These nimble competitors can dart into and out of niche markets as they emerge 
and recede, they can move faster to exploit market opportunities, and they can use modern tech-
nology to create, within a matter of weeks or months, products and services that once took years 
and all the resources a giant corporation could muster. The balance has tipped in favor of small, 
entrepreneurial companies. Howard Stevenson, Harvard’s chaired professor of entrepreneurship,
says, “Why is it so easy [for small companies] to compete against giant corporations? Because 
while they [the giants] are studying the consequences, [entrepreneurs] are changing the world.”6

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
19
One of the most comprehensive studies of global entrepreneurship conducted by the Global 
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) shows significant variation in the rate of new business forma-
tion among the nations of the world when measured by total entrepreneurial activity or TEA (see 
Figure 1.1). The most recent edition of the study reports that 12.7 percent of the adult population in 
the United States—one in eight people—is working to start a business. The GEM study also reports
that globally men are nearly twice as likely to start a business as women; that entrepreneurs are most 
likely to launch their companies between the ages of 35 and 44; and that the majority of people in the 
world see entrepreneurship as a good career choice.7 The health of the global economy and the level 
of entrepreneurial activity are intertwined. “The world economy needs entrepreneurs,” says GEM 
researcher Kent Jones, “and increasingly, entrepreneurs depend on an open and expanding world 
economy for new opportunities and growth—through trade, foreign investment, and finance.”8
The United States and many other nations are benefiting from this surge in global entre-
preneurial activity. Eastern European countries, China, Vietnam, and many other nations whose 
economies were state controlled and centrally planned are now fertile ground for growing small
businesses. Table 1.1 shows some of the results from a recent study that ranks 118 nations
according to the quality of the entrepreneurial environment they exhibit. Although troubled by 
corruption, a poor “ease of doing business” ranking, and a low quality entrepreneurial environ-
ment, Kenya is home to entrepreneurs of all ages who are hard at work solving problems that 
range from healthcare and electricity shortages to providing clean water and fashionable clothing 
to the nation’s 41 million residents.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Eric Muthomi: Stawi Foods and Fruits Eric Muthomi
grew up in Meru, Kenya, and studied law at the Catholic University of East Africa. While 
Muthomi was earning his law degree, his goal was to start his own business. After graduating
in 2010, Muthomi, just 26 years old, launched Stawi Foods and Fruits, a company that makes a 
unique banana flour that is used for baking, making baby food, and preparing ugali, a staple 
dish in Kenya. Muthomi, who also studied entrepreneurship and banana processing, says that 
coming up with his business idea was simple because his hometown of Meru is a center for 
banana growers and processors. Stawi Foods and Fruits benefited from the publicity and rec-
ognition that came after Muthomi won Jitihada, Kenya’s national business plan competition, 
beating out 3,439 other business ideas. Getting into business in Kenya was not easy, however; 
Muthomi says getting necessary permits and licenses for a food business from various govern-
ment entities is time-consuming and “tiresome.” Despite facing challenges, Stawi Foods and 
Fruits, which employs five people, reached its breakeven point in less than one year, and
Muthomi is reinvesting profits into the company to fuel its growth. The determined entrepre-
neur already has his sights set on exporting his company’s banana flour to other African na-
tions and eventually other continents. When asked what advice he could offer to other aspiring 
entrepreneurs, Muthomi recommends that they should not wait for conditions to be perfect 
before they launch their businesses; instead, they should start with whatever resources they 
have and grow from there.9 ■
Wherever they may choose to launch their companies, these business builders con-
tinue to embark on one of the most exhilarating—and frightening—adventures ever known: 
launching a business. It’s never easy, but it can be incredibly rewarding, both financially and 
emotionally. It can be both thrilling and dangerous, like living life without a safety net. Still, 
true entrepreneurs see owning a business as the real measure of success. Indeed, entrepre-
neurship often provides the only avenue for success to those who otherwise might have been
denied the opportunity.
Who are these entrepreneurs, and what drives them to work so hard with no guarantee of 
success? What forces lead them to risk so much and to make so many sacrifices in an attempt 
to achieve an ideal? Why are they willing to give up the security of a steady paycheck working 
for someone else to become the last person to be paid in their own companies? This chapter will 
examine the entrepreneur, the driving force behind the U.S. economy.

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
21
What Is an Entrepreneur?
An entrepreneur is one who creates a new business in the face of risk and uncertainty for the pur-
pose of achieving profit and growth by identifying significant opportunities and assembling the 
necessary resources to capitalize on them. Although many people come up with great business
ideas, most never act on their ideas. Entrepreneurs do. In his 1911 book The Theory of Economic 
Development, economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote that entrepreneurs are more than just business 
creators; they are change agents in society. The process of creative destruction, in which entrepre-
neurs create new ideas and new businesses that make existing ones obsolete, is a sign of a vibrant 
economy. Although this constant churn of businesses—some rising, others sinking, new ones
succeeding, and many failing—concerns some people, in reality it is an indication of a healthy, 
growing economic system that is creating new and better ways of serving people’s needs and 
improving their quality of life and standard of living. Schumpeter compared the list of leading
entrepreneurs to a popular hotel’s guest list: always filled with people but rarely the same ones.10
High levels of entrepreneurial activity translate into high levels of business formation and 
destruction and make an economy more flexible and capable of adapting to structural changes 
in the competitive landscape. One reason the U.S. economy has been so successful over time is
the constant churn that results from the rapid pace at which entrepreneurs create new businesses,
destroy old ones, and upend entire industries with their creativity and ingenuity. Entrepreneurs are 
important change agents in the global economy, uprooting staid industries with fresh new busi-
ness models that spot market opportunities and deliver the products and services customers want.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jennifer Hyman and Jenny Fleiss: Rent the Runway
While in college, Jenn Hyman came up with the idea for a designer clothing rental busi-
ness, Rent the Runway, that would disrupt the fashion industry after she witnessed one of her
sister’s “closet full of clothes, but nothing to wear” moments during Thanksgiving break. When 
she returned to school, she shared her idea with a suitemate, Jenny Fleiss, and the two collegiate 
entrepreneurs launched the company that rents high-end, designer clothing, accessories, and 
jewelry to customers at a fraction of the regular retail price. To test their business model (think 
“Netflix meets high fashion”), they used their savings to purchase 100 dresses and set up a pop-up 
shop on campus that proved to be a hit. The shop’s success convinced the entrepreneurial pair that
their business idea was valid and led them to conduct focus groups with more than 1,000 women, 
which gave them valuable insight into refining their business model and pricing strategy. Since
starting Rent the Runway in 2009, Hyman and Fleiss have raised nearly $55 million in four rounds
of financing from a “who’s who” list of venture capital firms and assembled an inventory of tens
of thousands of dresses from more than 170 designers, such as Nicole Miller, Vera Wang, Versace,
and Dolce and Gabbana. Customers go online, select the dress they want, enter their size
(a backup size comes free), and specify the rental date; returns are as easy as dropping the dress 
into a prepaid return envelope. “We deliver Cinderella moments,” says Hyman. Rent the Runway,
which became cash-flow positive in less than one year, now has more than 3 million members, and
financial experts estimate its value at $240 million.11 ■

profile.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Unfortunately, in the United States, the percentage of private companies that are start-up 
businesses (those companies that are less than one year old), the primary source of the economy’s 
healthy churn, has been declining since the late 1970s (see Figure 1.2). Although many entre-
preneurs fail, some more than once, those who succeed earn the satisfaction of creating value 
for their customers and wealth for themselves—all while working at something they love to do. 
Some of them create companies that change the world.
Researchers have invested a great deal of time and effort over the last few decades trying 
to paint a clear picture of “the entrepreneurial personality.” Although these studies have identi-
fied several characteristics entrepreneurs tend to exhibit, none of them has isolated a set of traits 
required for success. We now turn to a brief summary of the entrepreneurial profile.12
1. Desire for responsibility. Entrepreneurs feel a deep sense of personal responsibility for the 
outcome of ventures they start. They prefer to be in control of their resources, and they use 
those resources to achieve self-determined goals. Deborah Sullivan, a lifelong serial entre-
preneur realized at the age of 16 that she did not want to spend her life working for others. 
“You’re stuck by all of these different rules [when you work for someone else],” she says. 
“I wanted to create something for myself.” Sullivan has been an entrepreneur since she 
was 22 years old, when she launched a hair salon and spa in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2012, at 
the age of 60, Sullivan started Consign Werks, a consignment shop in Greenville, South
Carolina, which she says has been the most gratifying of her entrepreneurial ventures 
perhaps because she knew almost nothing about the business until she spent months 
researching and learning everything she could about consignment shops.13
2. Preference for moderate risk. Entrepreneurs are not wild risk takers but are instead calculated 
risk takers. Lee Lin, who left his job at a large investment bank to start RentHop, an online 
service that helps renters find the ideal apartment in New York City, says that entrepreneurs 
who risk everything typically do not stay in business very long. Lin says that to minimize risk,
he manages his company’s finances carefully and focuses on profitable growth opportunities.14
A study of the founders of the businesses listed as Inc. magazine’s fastest-growing companies
found no correlation between risk tolerance and entrepreneurship. The common belief that en-
trepreneurs prefer taking big risks is a myth. Unlike “high-rolling, riverboat gamblers,” entre-
preneurs rarely gamble. Their goals may appear to be high—even impossible—in others’ eyes,

but entrepreneurs see the situation from a different perspective and believe that their goals are
realistic and attainable.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Patrick Mish: M-Edge Accessories
Patrick Mish took his father’s advice to take the safe route by earning an 
engineering degree and getting a stable job. After earning a PhD in aero-
acoustics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Mish went to 
work for Northrop Grumman, where he was a member of the team that was 
responsible for creating the next generation of super-stealthy destroyers, but
he wasn’t happy. Mish spent his days in a cubicle dealing with corporate
bureaucracy but dreamed of owning a business of his own. He and his wife,
Devon, had purchased one of the first e-readers on the market and discovered 
that there were very few accessories to enhance its use. That’s when the idea to
start a business that sells e-reader accessories came to him. Mish began contact-
ing manufacturers with his designs and found one that could produce quality 
products and was willing to make them in the small quantities Mish ordered at 
first. Although he was not yet ready to take the plunge into full-time entrepre-
neurship, Mish began selling a small selection of accessories online after work. 
Realizing that he needed sales experience, Mish left his engineering job and 
became a sales representative for a small information technology firm before 
leaving to operate M-Edge full time. Mish says that by then, starting a business 
was not a huge risk because he had taken the necessary steps to prepare him-
self to be a successful entrepreneur. Today, M-Edge generates more than $37 million in an-
nual sales of e-book accessories and has appeared on Inc. magazine’s list of fastest-growing
companies.15 ■
Like Patrick Mish, entrepreneurs usually spot opportunities in areas that reflect their 
passions, knowledge, backgrounds, or experiences, which increases their probability of 
success. Successful entrepreneurs are not as much risk takers as they are risk eliminators,
systematically removing as many obstacles to the successful launch of their ventures as 
possible. One of the most successful ways of eliminating risks is to build a viable business 
plan for a venture.
3. Self-reliance. Entrepreneurs must fill multiple roles to make their companies successful, 
especially in the early days of a start-up. Because their resources usually are limited, they
end up performing many jobs themselves, even those they know little about. Yet, entrepre-
neurs demonstrate a high level of self-reliance and do not shy away from the responsibility 
for making their businesses succeed. Perhaps that is why many entrepreneurs persist in 
building businesses even when others ridicule their ideas as follies.
4. Confidence in their ability to succeed. Entrepreneurs typically have an abundance of 
confidence in their ability to succeed and are confident that they chose the correct career 
path. Entrepreneurs’ high levels of optimism may explain why some of the most successful
entrepreneurs have failed in business—often more than once—before finally succeeding.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: David Steinberg: XL Marketing In 2004, David 
Steinberg’s company, InPhonic, a business that sold mobile phones and services, made 
it to the top of Inc. magazine’s list of the fastest-growing small companies in the United 
States. By 2007, however, the company’s fast growth outstripped its cash flow, and InPhonic 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy before Steinberg sold it to an investment firm. While he was 
closing the InPhonic chapter of his entrepreneurial experience, Steinberg was launching 
another company, XL Marketing, which provides lead-generation and customer-acquisition
services for other businesses. With his second venture, Steinberg learned from the mistakes 
he made with InPhonic, securing adequate financing, managing carefully XL Marketing’s
financial resources, and controlling the company’s growth rate. Like Steinberg, smart entre-
preneurs recognize that their failures can be the source of some of the lessons that lead them 
to their greatest successes.16 ■
5. Determination. Some people call this characteristic “grit,” the ability to focus intently 
on achieving a singular, long-term goal. Studies show that grit is a reliable predictor of 
achievement and success, whether the goal involves launching a successful business,

winning the Scripps National Spelling Bee, or excelling in professional sports.17 (One 
recent study concludes that top performance in the National Football League’s Combine,
in which players who are entering the league’s draft perform short physical and mental
tasks, has no consistent statistical relationship to subsequent performance in the league.)
Successful entrepreneurs demonstrate high levels of determination, especially in the face 
of challenging circumstances. “Failure was not an option for me,” says Alexander Gomez, 
founder of New Wave Surgical, a highly successful company that designs, patents, and
markets laparoendoscopic medical devices used in surgery. “I had everything on the line. 
It was all or nothing for me.”18 Research by Robert Fairlie of the University of California, 
Santa Cruz, shows that the Great Recession, which began in late 2007, spawned a surge in 
entrepreneurship in the same types of businesses typically launched in prosperous times.19
Perhaps that explains why 57 percent of the Fortune 500 companies were launched in 
either a recession, a “bear” market, or both.20
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Romesh Wadhwani: Aspect Development Five 
years after starting a canteen with several other students on the campus of
Mumbai’s Indian Institute of Technology in 1964 with an investment of 100 rupees
(about $10), Romesh Wadhwani arrived in the United States with just $3.48 in his pocket. He 
earned a master’s degree and a PhD in bioengineering from Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and renewed his passion for entrepreneurship by launching a com-
pany that provided computer-based security and energy management services during the 
short recession of 1991. Wadhwani convinced an angel investor to invest $30,000 and pitched
his idea to 125 venture capital firms before he found one that was willing to finance a
business started by an entrepreneur with no experience. Just nine years later, Wadhwani sold
Aspect Development to i2 technologies for $9.3 billion. Wadhwani says it never occurred to
him to give up, and ultimately his tenacity paid off.21 ■
6. Desire for immediate feedback. Entrepreneurs enjoy the challenge of running a business, 
and they like to know how they are doing and are constantly looking for feedback. The 
feedback they receive from their businesses drives them to set higher standards of perfor-
mance for their companies and themselves.22
7. High level of energy. Entrepreneurs are more energetic than the average person. That 
energy may be a critical factor given the incredible effort required to launch a start-up 
company. Long hours and hard work are the rule rather than the exception, and the pace can 
be grueling. According to a recent survey by Bank of America, 72 percent of small business 
owners work more than 40 hours per week.23 Another recent survey by Sage Software reports 
that 37 percent of business owners work more hours per week than they did just five years 
ago.24 Will Schroter, an entrepreneur who has launched numerous companies, including 
Go Big Network, an online community for entrepreneurs, says that he works at 1:30 in the 
morning because he is the founder of a start-up and start-up founders often don’t have time 
to sleep because their work is never-ending. He laughs, adding that he can catchup on his
sleep in several years when his company has grown and matured and has levels of managers
to handle the immense workload that he currently manages himself.25
8. Future orientation. Entrepreneurs have a well-defined sense of searching for opportuni-
ties. They look ahead and are less concerned with what they did yesterday than with what 
they might do tomorrow. Not satisfied to sit back and revel in their success, real entrepre-
neurs stay focused on the future. A year after William Roetzheim’s software company, 
Marotz, landed on Inc. magazine’s list of the 500 fastest-growing companies in the United 
States, he sold it and launched another company, Cost Xpert Group, which sells a cost-
estimating tool he had developed at Marotz. When Cost Xpert Group reached about 
$5 million in annual sales, he sold it. “I always plan to sell when I get to $5 million,” says 
Roetzheim. “I like starting companies. I don’t want to run something big.” Roetzheim 
recently started another company, Level 4 Ventures, which provides project management 
software. His plan for the future? Expand Level 4 Ventures to $5 million in sales, sell it,
and start another company.26

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
25
Entrepreneurs see potential where most people see only problems or nothing at all, a 
characteristic that often makes them the objects of ridicule (at least until their ideas become 
huge successes). Whereas traditional managers are concerned with managing available 
resources, entrepreneurs are more interested in spotting and capitalizing on opportunities.
In the United States, 59 percent of those engaged in entrepreneurial activity are opportunity 
entrepreneurs, people who start businesses because they spot an opportunity in the mar-
ketplace, compared to necessity entrepreneurs, those who start businesses because they
cannot find work any other way.27
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: AJ Forsythe and Anthony Martin: iCracked After
California Polytechnic State University student AJ Forsythe cracked the screen on his
iPhone for the sixth time in just 18 months, the long-time tinkerer decided to fix his phone 
himself using parts he purchased on eBay. A few hours later, with his phone as good as new,
Forsythe realized he had discovered a significant business opportunity and decided to 
launch iCracked, an iPhone, iPad, and iPod repair service, from his dorm room to serve other 
Cal Poly students. The business grew quickly, and Forsythe teamed up with fellow students 
Leslee Lambert and Anthony Martin to turn iCracked into a full-time business. The entrepre-
neurs reworked their business model, choosing to train self-employed technicians, who 
would buy parts from iCracked to repair their customers’ devices. The young entrepreneurs 
took a chance and used credit cards to finance iCracked, often rolling up credit card bal-
ances of $30,000 to $40,000 per month. Today, iCracked generates $1.4 million in annual
sales and has thousands of satisfied customers and nearly 350 technicians across the United
States and in 11 other countries. To give back to the community, the entrepreneurs recently 
opened a retail store in a renovated hotel in Long Beach, California, that employs adult 
foster youth and provides them with a safe place to live. Forsythe says he and his cofounders 
have had so much fun launching iCracked that they cannot wait to see what their business
brings next.28 ■
Serial entrepreneurs, those who repeatedly start businesses and grow them to a 
sustainable size before striking out again, push this characteristic to the maximum. The 
majority of serial entrepreneurs are leapfroggers, people who start a company, manage its
growth until they get bored, and then sell it to start another. A few are jugglers (or parallel 
entrepreneurs), people who start and manage several companies at once. Serial entrepre-
neurs instinctively know that the process of creating a company takes time and choose to 
pursue several ideas at the same time.29 The Entrepreneur State of Mind study reports that 
d
54 percent of business owners are serial entrepreneurs.30 “The personality of the serial en-
trepreneur is almost like a curse,” admits one entrepreneurial addict. “You see opportunities 
every day.”31 At age 81, serial entrepreneur David Gilmour says he has been trying to retire
for four decades, but opportunities just kept coming his way. “None of my start-ups were
based on searching for something to do,” claims Gilmour, who has founded 11 companies 
(some of which failed) that range from a stereo maker and a luxury resort to bottled water 
and a gold mine. “I get the vision and the passion for the next project,” he says. “It must 
see the light of day.”32
It’s almost as if serial entrepreneurs are addicted to launching businesses. “Starting a 
company is a very imaginative, innovative, energy-driven, fun process,” says Dick Kouri, 
who has started 12 companies in his career and now teaches entrepreneurship at the 
University of North Carolina. “Serial entrepreneurs can’t wait to do it again.”33
9. Skill at organizing. Building a company “from scratch” is much like piecing together a 
giant jigsaw puzzle. Entrepreneurs know how to put the right people together to accom-
plish a task. Effectively combining people and jobs enables entrepreneurs to transform 
their visions into reality. “Great entrepreneurship is in the execution,” says Eric Paley, an 
entrepreneur-turned-venture-capitalist.34
10. Value of achievement over money. One of the most common misconceptions about en-
trepreneurs is that they are driven wholly by the desire to make money. To the contrary, 
achievement seems to be entrepreneurs’ primary motivating force; money is simply a
t
way of “keeping score” of accomplishments—a symbol of achievement. What drives

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
entrepreneurs goes much deeper than just the desire for wealth. Economist Joseph 
Schumpeter claimed that entrepreneurs have “the will to conquer, the impulse to fight, to 
prove oneself superior to others, to succeed for the sake, not of the fruits of success, but 
of success itself.” Entrepreneurs experience “the joy of creating, of getting things done, or 
simply of exercising one’s energy and ingenuity.”35
Other characteristics that entrepreneurs tend to exhibit include the following:
High degree of commitment. Entrepreneurship is hard work, and launching a company
successfully requires total commitment from an entrepreneur. Business founders often 
immerse themselves completely in their companies. Most entrepreneurs must overcome 
seemingly insurmountable barriers to launch a company and keep it growing. That requires 
commitment and fortitude. Oleg Firer, who at age 12 emigrated to the United States from 
Russia with his family, cofounded Unified Payments when he was 29. The debit and credit 
card processing company handles $10 billion in transactions for more than 100,000 merchants 
annually. Many people dream of launching their own companies; entrepreneurs such as 
Firer muster the commitment to actually do it. Firer says that the primary reasons for his 
success are his refusal to accept “no” as an answer and his “all-in” attitude toward his 
business.36
Tolerance for ambiguity. Entrepreneurs tend to have a high tolerance for ambiguous, 
ever-changing situations, the environment in which they most often operate. This ability 
to handle uncertainty is critical because these business builders constantly make decisions 
using new, sometimes conflicting information gleaned from a variety of unfamiliar sources. 
Based on his research, entrepreneurial expert Amar Bhidé says that entrepreneurs exhibit a 
willingness to jump into ventures even when they cannot visualize what the ultimate out-
come may be.37
Creativity. One of the hallmarks of entrepreneurs is creativity. They constantly come up 
with new product or service ideas, unique ways to market their businesses, and innovative
business models. Their minds are constantly at work developing unique business models,
services, and products. Davide Vigano, Mario Esposito, and Maurizio Macagno, founders 
of Heapsylon, focused their creativity on developing practical wearable technology de-
signed to improve people’s lives. One of the products their company has created is Sensoria 
fitness socks, which are made from a proprietary fabric equipped with sensors and include 
an electronic anklet that reads signals from the sensors. The anklet transmits information to 
the runner’s smart phone via an app that shows his or her speed, number of steps, distance 
traveled, and calories burned. The sophisticated device also tracks the runner’s cadence, 
foot-landing technique, and weight distribution on the foot. If Sensoria detects a problem, 
such as heel striking or overpronating, it offers the runner real-time verbal coaching cues 
to remedy it, allowing the runner to avoid injuries.38 You will learn more about the creative
process and how to stimulate entrepreneurial creativity in Chapter 2.
Flexibility. One hallmark of true entrepreneurs is their ability to adapt to the changing 
needs and preferences of their customers and the changing demands of the business envi-
ronment. In this rapidly changing global economy, rigidity often leads to failure. Success-
ful entrepreneurs learn to be masters of improvisation, reshaping and transforming their 
businesses as conditions demand. Research by Saras Sarasvathy, a professor at the Univer-
sity of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, shows that entrepreneurs excel at effectual 
reasoning, which “does not begin with a specific goal.” Instead, says Sarasvathy, “it begins
with a given set of means and allows goals to emerge contingently over time from the var-
ied imagination and diverse aspirations of the founders and the people they interact with. 
Effectual thinkers are like explorers setting out on voyages into uncharted waters.” Entre-
preneurs set goals, but their goals are flexible. Sarasvathy compares entrepreneurs to “iron 
chefs,” who prepare sumptuous meals when handed a hodgepodge of ingredients and given
the task of using their creativity to come up with an appetizing menu. Corporate CEOs, on 
the other hand, develop a plan to prepare a specific dish and then create a process for mak-
ing that dish in the most efficient, expeditious fashion.39

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
27
Resourceful. Entrepreneurs excel at getting the most out of the resources that are available,
however limited they may be. They are skilled at bootstrapping, a strategy that involves
conserving money and cutting costs during start-up so that entrepreneurs can pour every 
available dollar into their businesses.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ryan Barr: WhippingPost.com After holding a 
series of uninspiring jobs, Ryan Barr, a musician, started an online company,
WhippingPost.com, that markets high-quality leather products, such as guitar cases, guitar 
straps, tote bags, and “picker’s wallets.” Like many cash-starved entrepreneurs, Barr used 
bootstrapping to launch and grow his company. He would save enough money, buy some 
leather, and make a prototype. Once he had saved enough money, Barr visited a leather
manufacturer in Leon, Mexico, to whom he outsourced production of the company’s prod-
ucts. Priced at $825, Barr’s initial product, guitar cases, appealed to a limited audience, so he 
came up with the idea of a picker’s wallet, one that has a slot designed specifically to hold a 
guitar pick so that guitar players no longer have to resort to their standard practice of storing 
picks between their credit cards. Barr sent press releases about his picker’s wallet to numerous 
fashion, design, and music blogs, which generated several posts and good publicity. Priced
between $31 and $37, the picker’s wallet is now the company’s best-selling item and has 
helped WhippingPost.com surpass $200,000 in annual sales.40 ■
Willingness to work hard. Entrepreneurs work hard to build their companies, and there 
are no shortcuts around the workload. In his book Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm 
Gladwell observes that the secret to success in business (or sports, music, art, or any other 
field) is to invest at least 10,000 hours practicing and honing one’s skills. “What’s really in-
teresting about this 10,000-hour rule is that it applies virtually everywhere,” says Gladwell. 
For instance, Mark Cuban, billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks of the National 
Basketball Association and founder of Broadcast.com, the leading provider of multimedia 
and streaming on the Internet (which he sold to Yahoo! for $5.7 billion), says he worked 
for seven years without taking a day off to launch his first business, MicroSolutions, a 
computer systems integrator. Cuban spent his days making sales calls, and at night and on 
weekends he studied and practiced to learn everything he could about computers.41 Entre-
preneurs often capitalize on opportunities through sheer amounts of hard work through 
which they test, invalidate, test again, and finally validate their ideas. A great idea may 
come to an entrepreneur in a single moment, but building a successful business from that 
idea takes time and lots of hard work.42
Tenacity. Obstacles, obstructions, and defeat typically do not dissuade entrepreneurs from 
doggedly pursuing their visions. They simply keep trying. Hurricane Sandy nearly wiped 
out Jackie Summers’s company, Jack from Brooklyn, which produces a unique artisanal 
alcoholic beverage called sorel in an old warehouse in Brooklyn’s historic Red Hook dis-
trict. Despite the loss of product, equipment, and sales, Summers persevered and rebuilt 
his business. Summers’s spirit of tenacity, willingness to concentrate on a single unsur-
mountable task each day, and accomplishment of each task enabled him to recover from 
the devastating loss.43 Noting the obstacles that entrepreneurs must overcome, economist 
Joseph Schumpeter argued that success is “a feat not of intellect but of will.” Rick Smolan 
quit his job as a magazine photojournalist to launch A Day in the Life Inc., a company that 
publishes eye-popping coffee table books that feature photographs by professional photog-
raphers who swarm a particular country and capture its essence in 24-hour marathon photo 
sessions. “I met with 35 publishers,” says Smolan. “Every single one of them told me what 
an incredibly stupid idea A Day in the Life was.” Smolan persisted, and his company went 
on to produce 11 books that sold more than 5 million copies before he sold it to start an-
other business.44
What conclusion can we draw from the volumes of research conducted on the entrepre-
neurial personality? Entrepreneurs are not of one mold; no one set of characteristics can predict 
who will become entrepreneurs and whether they will succeed. Indeed, diversity seems to be a
central characteristic of entrepreneurs. One astute observer of the entrepreneurial personality 
explains, “Business owners are a culture unto themselves—strong, individualistic people who 
bootstrapping
a strategy that involves 
conserving money and cut-
ting costs during start-up so 
that entrepreneurs can pour 
every available dollar into 
their businesses.

scorn convention—and nowadays, they’re driving the global economy.”45 Indeed, entrepreneurs 
tend to be nonconformists, a characteristic that seems to be central to their views of the world 
and to their success.
As you can see from the examples in this chapter, anyone, regardless of age, race, gender, 
color, national origin, or any other characteristic, can become an entrepreneur (although not 
everyone should). There are no limitations on this form of economic expression. Entrepreneur-
ship is not a mystery; it is a practical discipline. Entrepreneurship is not a genetic trait; it is a skill 
that most people can learn. It has become a very common vocation. The editors of Inc. magazine
claim, “Entrepreneurship is more mundane than it’s sometimes portrayed. . . . You don’t need to be
a person of mythical proportions to be very, very successful in building a company.”46 Figure 1.3 
summarizes the qualities that company founders say are most important to entrepreneurs.
The Benefits of Entrepreneurship
Surveys show that owners of small businesses believe they work harder, earn more money, and 
are more satisfied than if they worked for someone else. Before launching any business venture, 
every potential entrepreneur should consider the benefits of small business ownership.
Opportunity to Create Your Own Destiny
Owning a business provides entrepreneurs the independence and the opportunity to achieve what 
is important to them. Entrepreneurs want to “call the shots” in their lives, and they use their busi-
nesses to make that desire a reality. “Owning your own business means you have some say in 
deciding what your destiny is going to be,” says Kathy Mills, founder of Strategic Communica-
tions, a highly successful information technology company in Louisville, Kentucky.47

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
29
For many entrepreneurs, living where and how they choose is one of the principal benefits of 
controlling their destinies through business ownership.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Alan Blado: Liquid 
Descent Alan Blado had a successful career as a stock-
broker in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but found his work unsat-
isfying. Nor did he enjoy wearing a suit to work every day. Blado
had worked as a whitewater rafting guide in college and loved
the thrill and beauty of being on the river. Several prime rivers,
including the Colorado River and the Eagle River, were nearby, 
and Blado decided to open his own whitewater rafting business. 
Blado bootstrapped his business, keeping his job and living with 
his parents for a few years so that he could save enough money 
to get into business. With the money he saved, Blado purchased 
a failed rafting business, renamed it Liquid Descent, and began 
marketing rafting trips with an emphasis on safety and customer 
satisfaction. Now with two Colorado locations in Idaho Springs 
and Kremmling, Blado works seven days a week during the busy 
summer season. Blado does not consider his calling to be work 
because he spends most of his days on the water in beautiful 
places with his clients doing what he loves.48 ■
Like Alan Blado, entrepreneurs reap the intrinsic rewards of knowing that they are the 
driving forces behind their businesses.
Opportunity to Make a Difference
Increasingly, entrepreneurs are starting businesses because they see an opportunity to make 
a difference in a cause that is important to them. Known as social entrepreneurs, these busi-
ness builders seek innovative solutions to some of society’s most vexing problems. They use 
their skills not only to create profitable business ventures but also to achieve social and envi-
ronmental goals for society as a whole. Their businesses often have a triple bottom line that 
encompasses economic, social, and environmental objectives. These entrepreneurs see their 
businesses as mechanisms for achieving social goals that are important to them as individu-
als. Whether it is providing low-cost, sturdy housing for families in developing countries or 
establishing a recycling program to preserve Earth’s limited resources, these entrepreneurs 
are finding ways to combine their concerns for social issues and their desire to earn a good 
living.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jessica Matthews and Julia Silverman:
Uncharted Play Jessica Matthews and Julia Silverman drew the inspiration 
for their business, Uncharted Play, from their travels abroad during college. Every-
where they went, even in the most poverty-stricken areas, they saw children playing
soccer, an observation that led them to create the Soccket ball, an energy-harnessing 
soccer ball, as part of an engineering class for non-engineers. Their goal was to cre-
ate a for-profit company whose goal is to improve the lives of the 1.4 billion people
around the world who have no access to electricity. The Soccket ball is a regulation-
size soccer ball that contains a motion-activated chargeable battery pack sur-
rounded by a foam core and acts as a portable generator, capturing and storing 
energy during play that people can use later to operate lights, cell phones, mini-
refrigerators, and other devices. The Soccket ball has a small flip cap that covers an 
electric socket into which users can plug various devices. For every 15 minutes of 
play, the Soccket ball can power an LED lamp for three hours. “We’re also thinking 
of how everything from basketballs to volleyballs can be useful,” Matthews says. 
“Making a difference doesn’t have to be serious and boring. It can be as simple and 
fun as playing soccer.”49 ■
Matthews and Silverman are just two of millions of social entrepreneurs who have started 
for-profit businesses with a broader goal of making the world a better place to live.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Management consulting firm Ernst & Young has developed the 
following model of an entrepreneur:
Nucleus. At the center of the model lie the entrepreneur’s 
complementary characteristics of an opportunistic mindset 
and an attitude of tolerance of risk and failure.
Opportunistic mindset. One of the hallmarks of entre-
preneurs is their ability to spot opportunities where others 
do not. They know that although disruptions create prob-
lems, they also create opportunities for those who are pre-
pared to capitalize on them. Avid beekeepers Tim Dover 
and Susan Gardner turned their hobby into a bee supply 
business that they operated out of their homes and then 
into a retail store in tiny Traveler’s Rest, South Carolina, 
when a new state law required beekeepers who produce 
more than 400 gallons of honey per year for resale to pro-
cess their honey in a Department of Agriculture-approved 
honey house. “That’s when we decided to turn our little 
home-based hobby business into a store,” says Gardner.
The entrepreneurs launched Carolina Honey Bee Company, 
purchased a building in the town’s revitalized business 
district, and converted it into a state-approved honey 
house that includes retail space for beekeeping supplies 
and local honey for nearby residents and area tourists. 
Although Gardner and Dover are not yet drawing salaries, 
Carolina Honey Bee Company is generating positive cash 
ﬂow. “We started this business on a shoestring budget,” 
says Dover, “and we’re at a point that it’s funding its own 
growth.” Surging interest in both beekeeping and in local 
food products are fueling their company’s growth. The en-
trepreneurs’ goal is to have multiple stores in several states 
within ﬁve years. “We want it to be a brand,” says Dover.
Tolerance of risk and failure. Most people are risk 
averse. Most entrepreneurs don’t take extraordinary risks, 
but they accept risk as a natural part of achieving big 
goals. Lyn Strong studied graphic design and painting at 
Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, 
where she took a class on jewelry making on a whim. 
She was captivated by the medium and, after graduation, 
purchased jewelry-making equipment to set up a studio in 
her small apartment. To learn the industry, she also took 
a job at a local jewelry store and worked her way into the 
store’s workshop. As her skills improved, Strong decided 
to go out on her own, selling her hand-crafted jewelry at
arts and crafts shows and eventually opening a retail store
in Greenville, South Carolina. Customers appreciate her
highly detailed pieces, which feature precious gemstones,
silver, platinum, and gold, because of their “everyday wear-
ability,” she says. Recently, Strong made signiﬁcant invest-
ments in technology and equipment so that she can pro-
duce pieces faster and expand her customer base nationally

and internationally. “I’ve stood out on a limb most of my 
life,” says the successful entrepreneur. “You have to take
risks to be successful, and I don’t think you always are.”
Inner Ring. The inner ring of the model shows six character-
istics that are integral parts of the entrepreneurial personality:
Drive, tenacity, and persistence. To bring their business
ideas to life, entrepreneurs must demonstrate drive, tenacity,
and persistence. Entrepreneurs must overcome countless
obstacles on their way to building successful businesses.
Architect of own vision; passionate and focused. As 
teens, copreneurs Larkin and Mark Hammond worked at 
fast-food restaurants before going to college and taking 
corporate jobs in California. For years, the Hammonds 
dreamed of owning a restaurant. Finally, they decided
to leave their corporate jobs behind, sell everything they 
owned, and move to the East Coast, where they pur-
chased a small lakeside restaurant in Lake Lure, North 
Carolina. Risky? “That’s where Larkin comes in,” laughs 
Mark. “She has a lot of conﬁdence.” The Hammonds 
quizzed all of their customers about their favorite dishes, 
items they would like to see on the menu, and décor ideas 
and integrated everything they learned into revamping the 
restaurant. Within three years, Larkins on the Lake was 
earning a proﬁt and providing the couple with salaries 
that exceeded their former corporate paychecks. Four-
teen years after they started, the entrepreneurial couple 
owns six restaurants and a catering business, but both of 
them agree that success is doing something that they love 
together.
Build an ecosystem of ﬁnance, people, and know-
how. Smart entrepreneurs know that they cannot do 
everything themselves and build a team of professionals 
to nurture and protect the business. While attending the 
University of South Carolina, Allen Stephenson dreamed 
of starting a business. Having operated a successful lawn 
care business in high school, Stephenson had a head start 
on the road to entrepreneurship. His inspiration came 
one day as a result of a semester he spent abroad in Italy,
where he saw ﬁrsthand ﬁne clothing made with attention 
to detail; he took a pair of scissors to his collection of polo 
shirts, cut away what he considered to be the best fea-
tures of each one, and stitched them back together into a 
model “Frankenstein” shirt. He spent the next year work-
ing with several textile industry veterans, perfecting his 
design for the perfect polo shirt and having samples made 
by 11 factories in four countries. Stephenson launched 
Southern Tide, ordered 5,500 shirts, and began calling on 
independent men’s shops to sell them. Most shop owners 
declined, which prompted him to start giving the owners 
a few shirts to wear or to give to their best customers. “I 
started getting phone calls saying, ‘We need more. We 
need more,’” he recalls. Sales accelerated quickly, and 
Stephenson made an important and selﬂess decision to 
bring in an experienced CEO, Jim Twining. “I was sure [the 
business] was going to work if I just kept working at it 
and getting the right people together,” he says. “I knew 
it wouldn’t work with what and who I alone knew at the 
time.” Twining led Southern Tide in a $1.8 million round 
of equity ﬁnancing and developed a strategic plan to 
guide its growth. Today, Southern Tide’s product line has 
grown well beyond the perfect polo shirt to include pants, 
T-shirts, hats, belts, shoes, swimwear, and more and is sold
in nearly 600 stores in 43 states and on its Web site. Many 
publications, including Inc. and Forbes, have recognized 
Stephenson’s Southern Tide as one of the fastest-growing 
small companies in the United States.
Seek out market niches and gaps. Entrepreneurs are
adept at ﬁnding lucrative niches and gaps in the market 
that large businesses often overlook. After graduating from 
Clemson University, Craig Pavlish, a fan of craft beers, worked 
with his partners, who were experienced brew masters, to 
open Growler Station (a growler is a special amber-colored 
container used to carry fresh craft beer home from a 
brewery), a craft brewery in Greenville, South Carolina. With
a vibrant downtown district ﬁlled with restaurants, perfor-r
mance venues, and shops; a growing population of upscale, 
educated young people; and a large international community,
Greenville proved to be the ideal location for a niche business 
such as a craft brewery. “The trail has been blazed here in 
Greenville,” says Pavlish. Growler Station’s unique process 
and technology allows the small brewery to bottle beer in 
growlers so that customers can take it home, unlike typical 
growlers, which must be consumed immediately.
Live what you believe; build success, culture, and 
values. As you have seen, entrepreneurs create company
cultures that reﬂect their values and belief systems. 
Entrepreneurs often build businesses that seek to achieve 
ﬁnancial, social, and environmental goals that make their 
communities—and the world—better places to live.
Be a nonconformist and a team player. Entrepre-
neurs tend to be nonconformists, choosing to do things 
their own way. Just as many traditional managers would 
ﬁnd the life of an entrepreneur unsettling, so too would
entrepreneurs ﬁnd the boundaries, rules, and traditions of 
corporate life stiﬂing and boring. Yet successful entrepre-
neurs recognize the importance of being team players.
They understand that accomplishing big goals requires a
broad set of skills that no one person has. Sisters Sophie
LaMontagne and Kallinis Berman were close growing up
but went their separate ways after college. LaMontagne 
became a biotech expert, and Berman worked in the fashion 
industry. In 2007, the sisters reunited to realize a dream they
had had since childhood: owning a bakery together. “We
quit our jobs, borrowed our grandmother’s cake recipes, and
took a leap of faith,” says LaMontagne. Today, the sisters
are at the helm of Georgetown Cupcake, a bakery that has
grown from a two-person shop outside of Washington, DC, 
to a 350-person operation with stores in New York City, 
Boston, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. “Having your sister as 
your business partner gives you a huge head start,” says La 
Montagne. “I’m not saying it’s easy, but if anything goes
wrong, you know you’ve got your sister behind you.”

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Opportunity to Reach Your Full Potential
Too many people find their work boring, unchallenging, and unexciting. But not entrepreneurs!
To them, there is little difference between work and play; the two are synonymous. Entrepre-
neurs’ businesses become their instruments for self-expression and self-actualization. They know 
that the only boundaries on their success are those imposed by their own creativity, enthusiasm, 
and vision. Owning a business gives them a sense of empowerment. While Elizabeth Elting was
in college, she worked in the translation industry, where she saw plenty of room for improvement. 
After she met Phil Shawe at New York University’s Stern School of Business, the pair decided 
to start TransPerfect Translations to provide timely, accurate translation services to companies 
across the globe. Launched from a dorm room, TransPerfect Translations now employs more 
than 2,000 people in 80 offices on six continents and generates annual sales of more than 
$350 million. Elting and Shawe have financed the companies’ growth without any external fi-
nancing. Elting says she and Shawe enjoy having the freedom to make their own business deci-
sions and not having to explain them to investors or anyone else. The duo also agree there is 
nothing they would rather be doing than running their own business.50
Opportunity to Reap Impressive Profits
Although money is not the primary force driving most entrepreneurs, the profits their businesses 
can earn are an important motivating factor in their decisions to launch companies. A recent survey 
by Wells Fargo reports that 72 percent of small business owners believe they are in a better finan-
cial position running their own businesses than working for a company in the same field.51 Several 
studies, including one by the Institute for the Study of Labor, confirm this belief; the median salary 
for entrepreneurs is 18 percent higher than that for employed workers.52 What explains the earning 
differential? “While employees suffer from the ‘guard rails’ and ‘iron cages’ of corporate America, 
entrepreneurs are able to create environments over time that maximize the value of their education 
and skills,” notes one writer.53 Entrepreneurs are not constrained by the boundaries that corporate 
hierarchies impose on their employees; they are free to create value by making the best use of their 
experience, skills, abilities, and ideas and, as a result, reap the financial benefits of their creative 
efforts. Most entrepreneurs never become superrich, but many of them do become quite wealthy. 
In fact, more than two-thirds of the billionaires on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans 
are first-generation entrepreneurs!54 People who own their own businesses are more likely to be 
millionaires than those who are employed by others. According to Russ Alan Prince and Lewis 
Schiff, authors of The Middle Class Millionaire, more than 80 percent of middle-class million-
aires, those people with a net worth between $1 million and $10 million, own their own businesses 
or are part of professional partnerships. (They also work an average of 70 hours a week.)55 Indeed, 
the typical millionaire’s business is not a glamorous, high-tech enterprise; more often, it is some-
thing much less glamorous—scrap metal, welding, auctioneering, garbage collection, and the like.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Madison Robinson: Fish Flops When Madison Robinson
was just eight years old, she was living at the beach in Galveston Island, Texas, and came up

launched a Web site and wrote to buyers at upscale department stores Nordstrom and Macy’s, which 
not only agreed to sell Fish Flops but also asked Madison to design a line of Fish Flops for women.
Madison used social media marketing to catch the attention of reporters, television show hosts 
(including Entertainment Tonight’s Nancy O’
s
Dell), and HSN’s Tony Little. Her company also received
publicity after Madison convinced celebrities to sign 300 pairs of Fish Flops that she donated to
patients at a children’s hospital. As she enters the tenth grade, Madison already has sold more than 
60,000 pairs of Fish Flops, generating more than $1.2 million in sales. In business just two years, 
Madison’s company has diversified into apparel and children’s books and is already profitable, earn-
ing more than enough to cover her tuition for college, where she plans to study business.56 ■
Opportunity to Contribute to Society and Be Recognized for Your Efforts
Playing a vital role in their local business systems and knowing that their work has a significant 
impact on the nation’s economy is yet another reward for small business managers. Often, small 
business owners are among the most respected and most trusted members of their communities.
Business deals based on trust and mutual respect are the hallmark of many established small 
companies. These owners enjoy the trust and recognition they receive from the customers and the 
communities they have served faithfully over the years. A recent Public Affairs Council survey 
reports that 87 percent of adults have a favorable view of small businesses, compared to just 
41 percent who view the federal government favorably.57 An earlier version of the same survey 
reports that 68 percent of adults say they prefer doing business with a small local company that 
charges somewhat higher prices than a large national company that offers lower prices.58
Opportunity to Do What You Enjoy and Have Fun at It
A common sentiment among small business owners is that their work really isn’t work. Most suc-
cessful entrepreneurs choose to enter their particular business fields because they have an interest 
in them and enjoy those lines of work. They have made their avocations (hobbies) their vocations 
(work) and are glad they did! In a recent Gallup poll, 51 percent of entrepreneurs said that if 
money were no object, they would continue to work either full- or part-time in their businesses,
and 18 percent said they would start another business.59 These entrepreneurs are living Harvey
McKay’s advice: “Find something you love to do, and you’ll never have to work a day in your 
life.” The journey rather than the destination is the entrepreneur’s greatest reward. “Rather than 
have money be your primary motivator,” says Tony Hsieh, CEO of online shoe retailer Zappos,
a company that Hsieh sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion, “think about what you would be so pas-
sionate about doing that you’d be happy doing it for 10 years, even if you never made any money 
from it. That’s what you should be doing. Your passion is what’s going to get you through the 
hard times. Your passion is going to be contagious and rub off onto employees and have a ripple 
effect on customers and business partners as well.”60

PROFILE: 
Ian 
McMenamin: 
Anything 
Coral When 
Ian 
McMenamin was in high school, he worked in a pet store and spent a lot of time near the
saltwater aquariums because he was fascinated by the beautifully colored coral in them. 
McMenamin learned that the more colorful the coral, the higher its selling price and that it is pos-
sible to grow coral. He took some of the money he had saved from his part-time job and invested 
in the equipment he needed to grow coral. His early efforts failed, but over time, McMenamin 
engaged in extensive research and conducted his own experiments to learn which diets produced 
the best results for his coral and was able to produce enough to sell to customers he found through 
Craigslist. As his knowledge base grew, McMenamin began growing rare varieties of coral, which
attracted more customers, many of whom were willing and able to pay premium prices for rare 
specimens of coral. While he was a sophomore at the University of Oregon, McMenamin invested
$12,000 in more sophisticated equipment and officially launched his company, Anything Coral. His
customer base grew, and today, McMenamin, who recently graduated from the University of 
Oregon with a degree in business and entrepreneurship, rents a 1,500-square-foot room in the 
basement of his apartment building in Eugene, Oregon, where he grows more than 400 varieties

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
The Potential Drawbacks of Entrepreneurship
Owning a business has many benefits and provides many opportunities; however, anyone plan-
ning to enter the world of entrepreneurship should be aware of its potential drawbacks. Although 
operating a successful business has never been easy, 59 percent of small business owners say 
running their companies is harder now than it was five years ago. In addition to a soft economy, 
entrepreneurs cited difficulty keeping pace with technology and more competition from direct 
rivals and large companies as the primary reasons that business is more difficult today.62 Entre-
preneurship is not a suitable career path for the timid. Individuals who prefer the security of a
steady paycheck, a comprehensive benefits package, a two-week paid vacation, and the support 
of a corporate staff probably should not go into business for themselves. Some of the disadvan-
tages of entrepreneurship include the following.
Uncertainty of Income
Opening and running a business provides no guarantee that an entrepreneur will earn enough 
money to survive. Although the mean and median incomes for entrepreneurs are higher than 
those for employees, so is the variability of entrepreneurs’ incomes. In other words, some entre-
preneurs earn far more through their companies than they could working for someone else, but 
other entrepreneurs’ businesses barely earn enough to provide them with an adequate income. In 
the early days of a start-up, a business often cannot provide an attractive salary for its owner and 
meet all its financial obligations, meaning that the entrepreneur may have to live on savings or a 
spouse’s income. The steady income that comes with working for someone else is absent because
the owner is always the last one to be paid.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Gary Whitehill: Entrepreneur Week Gary Whitehill, a 
former investment banker on Wall Street, decided to forego his six-figure salary and invest
his life savings into a start-up venture, Entrepreneur Week. Whitehill and his cofounders estimate
that they saved $350,000 in the first year by bootstrapping their start-up, which sponsors events
around the world that are designed to provide other entrepreneurs with the skills and inspiration 
they need to launch their companies. The cofounders agreed that they would not draw salaries
for at least one year, used their network of contacts to secure publicity and in-kind start-up ser-
vices, and worked from their homes to avoid the cost of renting office space. Whitehill had interns
sleeping on his couches and managers staying in spare bedrooms and held weekly strategy ses-
sions on his patio.63 ■
Risk of Losing Your Entire Investment
Business failure can lead to financial ruin for an entrepreneur, and the small business failure rate 
is relatively high. According to research by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 34 percent of new 
businesses fail within two years, and 51 percent shut down within five years. Within 10 years, 
66 percent of new businesses will have folded.64 Business failure can mean financial ruin for an 
entrepreneur. Before “reaching for the golden ring,” entrepreneurs should ask themselves if they 
can cope psychologically with the consequences of failure:
● What is the worst that could happen if I open my business and it fails?
● How likely is the worst to happen? (Am I truly prepared to launch my business?)
● What can I do to lower the risk of my business failing?
● If my business were to fail, what is my contingency plan for coping?
Long Hours and Hard Work
Business start-ups usually demand long hours and hard work from their owners. The average 
small business owner works 51 hours a week, compared to the 40.2 hours per week the typi-
cal U.S. production employee works.65 Adam Warren, founder of Syinc.tv and Sportyourself, 
companies that allows users to incorporate links to retailers’ Web sites for the products that 
appear in their online photographs and receive payment when someone purchases a tagged 
item, says that his business is nothing like a 9-to-5 job. Warren’s workday typically starts at 
6:30 a.m. and does not end until 10 p.m. or later, but Warren does not view it as work. Operating

his own business is a passion that he sees as a calling.66 In many start-ups, six- or seven-day work-
weeks with no paid vacations are the norm. A recent survey by American Express OPEN reports 
that only 49 percent of small business owners were planning to take a summer vacation of at least 
one week. The primary reason entrepreneurs don’t take vacations? “Too busy.”67 The demands of 
owning a business make achieving a balance between work and life difficult for entrepreneurs. 
Many entrepreneurs find that they must work 60 to 80 hours a week as they build their businesses 
and must push their personal lives aside until their companies are established.68
Lower Quality of Life Until the Business Gets Established
The long hours and hard work needed to launch a company can take their toll on the other aspects of 
an entrepreneur’s life. Business owners often find that their roles as husbands or wives and fathers or 
mothers take a backseat to their roles as company founders. In fact, according to a survey by American 
Express, 67 percent of entrepreneurs say that owning a business requires them to make sacrifices, 
most often in the areas of family relationships and friendships.69 Meg Hirshberg, whose husband Gary 
founded Stonyfield Farm, a maker of organic yogurt, says that an entrepreneur’s family members 
actually are his or her most important investors because no one will sacrifice more or be affected 
more by the outcome of the business venture. Because launching a business consumes so much of an 
entrepreneur’s time, energy, and focus, his or her family members often wonder whether the business 
takes priority over family.70 Part of the problem is that more than three-fourths of all entrepreneurs 
launch their businesses between the ages of 20 and 44, just when they marry and start their families.71
As a result, marriages, families, and friendships are too often casualties of small business ownership.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Frances and Michael Weldon: Cattail Ridge Family
Market 
Four years after launching Cattail Ridge Family Market in Sackville, New 
Brunswick, Frances Weldon was exhausted from the constant challenges of starting and running 
a business and felt isolated because the business consumed almost all of her time and energy. To 
regain balance in her life, she asked her husband Michael to join the company. Frances now man-
ages the sales floor because customer service is her strength, and Michael handles the company’s 
operations, which is his strength. The change saved the company. The Weldons spend more time
with their friends and family and will soon take their first vacation since starting the business.72 ■
High Levels of Stress
Starting and managing a business can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but it also can be 
a highly stressful one (see Figure 1.4). Entrepreneurs often have made significant investments in 
their companies, have left behind the safety and security of a steady paycheck and benefits, and 
have mortgaged everything they own to get into business. Failure may mean total financial ruin, 
and that creates intense levels of stress and anxiety! Sometimes entrepreneurs unnecessarily bear 
the burden of managing alone because they cannot bring themselves to delegate authority and 
responsibility to others in the company, even though their employees are capable.
Complete Responsibility
It’s great to be the boss, but many entrepreneurs find that they must make decisions on issues about 
which they are not really knowledgeable. Many business owners have difficulty finding advisers. 
When there is no one to ask, the pressure can build quickly. The realization that the decisions they 
make are the cause of their company’s success or failure has a devastating effect on some people.
Discouragement
Launching a business is a substantial undertaking that requires a great deal of dedication, 
discipline, and tenacity. Along the way to building a successful business, entrepreneurs will run 
headlong into many different obstacles, some of which appear to be insurmountable. In the face 
of such difficulties, discouragement and disillusionment are common emotions. Successful entre-
preneurs know that every business encounters rough spots along the way, and they wade through
difficult times with lots of hard work and an abundant reserve of optimism.
Despite the challenges that starting and running a business pose, entrepreneurs are very satis-
fied  with their career choices. A Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index survey reports that 
83 percent of small business owners say that if they were choosing a career again, they would still 

36
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
become small business owners.73 “I absolutely love what I’m doing,” says Scott Badger, founder of 
KPI Direct, a consulting company that helps businesses create direct marketing programs. “I have no 
regrets.”74 Many entrepreneurs are so happy with their work that they want to continue it indefinitely. 
In fact, 63 percent of entrepreneurs polled in a recent survey say they never intend to fully retire, choos-
ing instead to work either full- or part-time, and 4 percent say they intend to start a new business.75
Behind the Boom: What’s Feeding  
the Entrepreneurial Fire
What forces are driving this entrepreneurial trend in our economy? Which factors have led to this 
age of entrepreneurship? Some of the most significant ones include the following:
Entrepreneurs as heroes. An intangible but compelling factor is the attitude that Americans 
have toward entrepreneurs. As a nation, we have raised them to hero status and have held 
out their accomplishments as models to follow. Business founders such as Bill Gates 
(Microsoft Corporation), Kevin Plank (Under Armour), Oprah Winfrey (Harpo Productions
and OWN [the Oprah Winfrey Network]), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Robert Johnson (Black 
Entertainment Television), Steve Jobs (Apple), and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) are to
entrepreneurship what LeBron James, Michael Phelps, and Tom Brady are to sports.
Entrepreneurial education. Colleges and universities have discovered that entrepreneur-
ship is an extremely popular course of study. Disillusioned with corporate America’s down-
sized job offerings and less promising career paths, a rapidly growing number of students 
sees owning a business as their best career option. Increasingly, students enroll in college 
knowing that they want to start their own companies rather than considering entrepreneur-
ship as a possibility later in life; indeed, many are starting companies while they are in 
college. Today, more than two-thirds of the colleges and universities in the United States 
(more than 2,300) offer more than 5,000 courses in entrepreneurship or small business, up 
from just 16 in 1970. More than 400,000 students are enrolled in entrepreneurship courses 
taught by nearly 9,000 faculty members, and many colleges and universities have difficulty 
meeting the demand for courses in entrepreneurship and small business.76

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jeremy Young: HillFresh Laundry When Jeremy 
Young enrolled at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, he declared a major in art 
history, but joining the entrepreneurship club on campus in his sophomore year changed his
future. During one of the club’s meetings, Young pitched the idea of a prepaid laundry ser-
vice aimed at busy students and soon had partnered with four other students to research the 
market and prepare a business plan. Rather than raise capital to start a laundry business, Hill 
and his partners decided to become laundry brokers. Impressed with the young entrepre-
neurs’ business plan and professionalism, college administrators approved their request to 
launch their company, Hillfresh Laundry, on campus. The entrepreneurs mailed materials pro-
moting their laundry service and within 18 months had recouped their initial investments and 
were earning a profit. Young immediately began preparing a succession plan to ensure that
HillFresh Laundry continues to operate after he graduates. The founders donate a portion of 
the company’s sales to the entrepreneurship club that helped them get started.77 ■
Demographic and economic factors. More than 75 percent of entrepreneurs start their 
businesses between the ages of 20 and 44, and the number of Americans in that age range 
currently is nearly 103 million! In addition, the economic growth that spanned most of the 
last 25 years created a significant amount of wealth among people of this age group and 
many business opportunities on which they can capitalize.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Michelle Lam and Aarthi Ramamurthy: True & Co.
After Michelle Lam, 33, a former research associate with several large multinational 
consulting firms, spent two hours in a fruitless search for a new bra at a San Francisco depart-
ment store, she decided that there had to be a better way and decided to improve the cus-
tomer buying experience that has remained the same since the modern bra was invented in 
the mid-1930s. Lam worked with Aarthi Ramamurthy, a former program manager for Micro-
soft, to develop an online quiz using guidelines that experts use to fit customers without using
a tape measure. After testing the quiz, which is based on a computer algorithm that accounts 
for more than 2,000 body variations, with the help of a professional fitter at bra-fitting parties
they hosted, Lam and Ramamurthy raised $2 million from angels and venture capital firms and 
launched True & Co., their bra-fitting business and online retail store. After a shopper com-
pletes the fitting quiz, the algorithm identifies her “best fits,” and after receiving a $45 fully-
refundable deposit, True & Co. ships her up to five bras. Customers pay only for those they 
keep; shipping and returns are free. Sales are growing rapidly, and Lam and Ramamurthy have
expanded their product line to include other lingerie and are planning to introduce their own 
private label line of bras. One investor says True & Co. has identified a customer pain point in
the $12 billion intimate apparel industry and is offering a valuable solution to it.78 ■
Shift to a service economy. The service sector accounts for 82.5 percent of the jobs and 
79.7 percent of the private sector gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States, both 
of which represent a sharp rise from just a decade ago.79 Because of their relatively low 
start-up costs, service businesses have become very popular among entrepreneurs. The
booming service sector continues to provide many business opportunities, from educational 
services and computer maintenance to pet waste removal and iPod repair.
Technology advancements. With the help of modern business machines such as personal
computers, laptop computers, smart phones, fax machines, copiers, color printers, answer-
ing machines, and voice mail, even one person working at home can look like a big busi-
ness. At one time, the high cost of such technological wizardry made it impossible for 
small businesses to compete with larger companies that could afford the hardware. Today, 
however, powerful computers, smart phones, and communication equipment are priced 
within the budgets of even the smallest businesses and have drastically reduced the cost of 
launching a business. Noting how technology has made testing an idea and starting a busi-
ness much easier, David Kappos, head of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, says, 
“The distance between an idea and the marketplace has decreased dramatically.”80 Al-
though entrepreneurs may not be able to manufacture heavy equipment in their spare bed-
rooms, they can run a service- or information-based company from their homes—or almost 
anywhere—very effectively and look like any Fortune 500 company to customers and cli-
ents. Jimbo Wales, founder of Wikipedia, says, “Wherever my laptop is, that’s my office.”81

38
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Independent lifestyle. Entrepreneurship fits the way Americans want to live—independent 
and self-sustaining. People want the freedom to choose where they live, what hours they
work, and what they do. Although financial security remains an important goal for most 
entrepreneurs, many place top priority on lifestyle issues, such as more time with family
and friends, more leisure time, and more control over work-related stress.
The Internet, cloud computing, and mobile marketing. The proliferation of the Internet, 
the vast network that links computers around the globe and opens up oceans of informa-
tion to its users, has spawned thousands of entrepreneurial ventures since its beginning in 
1993. Cloud computing, Internet-based subscription or pay-per-use software services that 
allow business owners to use a variety of business applications, from database management 
and inventory control to customer relationship management and accounting, has reduced 
business start-up and operating costs. Fast-growing small companies can substitute cloud
computing applications for networks of computers and large office spaces, which allows
entrepreneurs to build their companies without incurring high overhead costs.
Online retail sales, which currently account for 10 percent of total retail sales, are fore-
casted to continue to grow rapidly (see Figure 1.5), creating many opportunities for Web-
savvy entrepreneurs. Computer software and hardware, books, music, consumer electronics, 
office supplies, and apparel are among the best-selling items on the Internet, but entrepreneurs 
are learning that they can use this powerful tool to sell just about anything! In fact, entrepre-
neurs are using the Internet to sell services such as tours to the sites of their favorite television
shows and movies (including Sex and the City and The Sopranos), pajama parties for women, 
products such as crocheted cotton thong underwear, and recordings by musicians who per-
form for tips in the New York City subway.82 Sami Bay launched the Something Store, an 
online store where customers pay $10 (shipping is free) and receive “something,” a random 
item that the company guarantees sells for at least $10. Tens of thousands of customers have
ordered something from the store and have received surprises that range from coffee mugs 
and USB hubs to cool toys and iPods.83
Currently, about 60 percent of small businesses have Web sites, double the number that 
had Web sites in 1997, and 67 percent of business owners say they use their Web sites to

or pay-per-use software

market to their customers, second only to word-of-mouth as a marketing tool.84 Business 
owners are discovering the importance of connecting with online customers through their 
mobile devices. In fact, 37 percent of the time users spend on the Internet is on a mobile
device, but only 26 percent of small companies have mobile-friendly Web sites.85 Small 
companies that make their Web sites mobile friendly typically reap benefits quickly, how-
ever, in the form of new customers and increased sales. According to one study, 84 percent 
of small businesses report an increase in new business as a result of their mobile market-
ing efforts.86
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Andy Kurtzig: Pearl.com When Andy Kurtzig’s wife
was pregnant with their first child, she called her doctor so often with questions that 
the physician finally asked her to call less often. The situation gave Kurtzig the idea to create 
a Web site, Pearl.com, that connects people who have questions to experts in hundreds of 
fields, ranging from medicine to home repairs. “I thought, ‘Why not program a Web site so
she could talk to a doctor anytime she wanted?’” he says. Pearl.com screens its experts with 
background checks and an eight-step vetting process. Fees range from $10 to $90 with an 
average of $30, and the average response time to a customer’s question is 7.5 minutes. Pearl
.com, now with 140 full-time employees, has a stable of 10,000 experts and operates in
196 countries. Kurtzig used bootstrapping to launch his company and get it to 10 million 
unique monthly users before he raised $51.3 million in two rounds of venture capital financ-
ing to fuel its growth and to develop mobile versions of the Web site.87 ■
International opportunities. No longer are small businesses limited to pursuing customers 
within their own borders. The shift to a global economy has opened the door to tremendous 
business opportunities for entrepreneurs willing to reach across the globe. Although the 
United States is an attractive market for entrepreneurs, approximately 95 percent of the 
world’s population and 80 percent of its purchasing power lie outside U.S. borders.88
The emergence of potential markets across the globe and crumbling barriers to interna-
tional business because of trade agreements have opened the world to entrepreneurs 
who are looking for new customers. Whereas companies once had to grow into global 
markets, today small businesses can have a global scope from their inception. Called
micromultinationals, these small companies focus more on serving customers’ needs than 
on the countries in which their customers live. More than 305,000 small businesses export 
goods and services. In fact, small businesses make up nearly 98 percent of all businesses 
engaged in exporting, yet they account for only 33 percent of the nation’s export sales.89
Many small companies that could export do not take advantage of export opportunities, 
often because their owners don’t know how or where to start an export initiative. Although 
regional unrest and recessions remain challenges to international trade, global opportuni-
ties for small businesses have a long-term positive outlook.
Although going global can be fraught with dangers and problems, many entrepreneurs are 
discovering that selling their products and services in foreign markets is really not so diffi-
cult. Small companies that have expanded successfully into foreign markets tend to rely on 
the following strategies:
● Researching foreign markets thoroughly
● Focusing on a single country initially
● Utilizing government resources designed to help small companies establish an interna-
tional presence
● Forging alliances with local partners
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Lawrence Sheer: Magnificent Baby Lawrence Sheer’s 
business, Magnificent Baby, has been a global company since he started it in 2010. Sheer’s
company, which is based in New York City, manufactures its baby products, which use magnetic 
fasteners rather than snaps or buttons, in China and distributes them in 20 countries around the 
world. Sheer entered international markets only when enough customers in a particular country 
demonstrated interest in the company’s products. Magnificent Baby generates nearly 10 percent
of its sales from exports, and Sheer recently signed agreements with foreign distributors in 
Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand. Currently, he is working to find a foreign
distributor in Great Britain.90 ■

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
For growing numbers of students, college is not just a time of 
learning, partying, and growing into young adulthood; it is fast be-
coming a place for building a business. More than 2,300 colleges 
and universities offer courses in entrepreneurship and small busi-
ness management (an increase from just 200 schools in the 1970s)
to more than 400,000 students, and many of them have trouble
keeping up with demand for these classes. “Students used to come 
to college and assume that five to ten years down the road, they’d
start a business,” says Gerry Hills, cofounder of the Collegiate
Entrepreneurs Organization. “[Today], they come in preparing to
get ideas and launch.”
Many collegiate entrepreneurs realize that if they are going 
to have a job when they graduate, it is likely to be one they have 
created for themselves. According to a recent survey by Accenture, 
only 16 percent of college graduates who applied for a job had one 
waiting for them after graduation. For a growing number of college
students, landing a job in corporate America, starting on the bot-
tom rung of an uncertain career ladder, has lost much of its allure. 
While studying at Harvard (where she majored in the history of sci-
ence), Windsor Hanger worked in internships at OK! Magazine and 
at Bloomingdale’s, which offered her a marketing position when 
she graduated. Hanger turned down the job offer, choosing instead 
to focus on the business, HerCampus, an online magazine aimed 
at college women, that she had started with classmates Stephanie 
Kaplan and Annie Wang. “It’s not a pure dichotomy anymore that 
entrepreneurship is risky and other jobs are safe, so why not do
what I love?” she says. For their work at HerCampus, which is now
profitable, Hanger, Kaplan, and Wang recently were named to Inc.
magazine’s “30 Under 30 Coolest Young Entrepreneurs” list.
Perhaps because of their stage in life, college entrepreneurs 
are particularly keen at spotting business opportunities. When 
Derek Pacqué was a senior at Indiana University, he was at a night-
club one cold evening and tucked his coat away in a corner for 
safekeeping. When he went to get his coat later, however, it was 
gone. Pacqué never found his coat, but he did find the inspiration 
for a business when he realized that none of the bars in town had 
a coat check. Pacqué approached several bar owners around town 
to see whether they were interested in a coat check service. Many 
were, and Pacqué launched Hoosier Coat Check, investing $500
to build portable coat racks and hiring several college students 
to staff them. Hoosier Coat Check collected between 10 percent 
and 30 percent of the $2 to $3 check fee the bars charged and in
just six months generated $50,000 in revenue. The business was
more profitable than Pacqué had expected, but numerous unan-
ticipated problems cropped up as well, including lost tickets and 
matching customers with the wrong coats.
After graduating, Pacqué worked with a former professor to
reformulate his business model to eliminate paper tickets and in-
corporate digital technology. Now, an app uses photographs and 
QR codes to check customers’ coats, increasing both the speed 
and the reliability of the service. He also changed the name of
the company to CoatChex and began to focus on events at large 
venues rather than local bars. He landed contracts to provide
coat check services for the ESPN and Maxim Super Bowl parties 
in Indianapolis, and the company grew from there. Pacqué also 
discovered an unexpected angle on his company’s digital coat
check service. His customers wanted access to the information 
that CoatChex collected on its customers through its app so that 
they could connect with customers through social media such as 
Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Pacqué is searching for $1 million from private investors
to fuel CoatChex’s growth so that the company can live up to 
its potential. He appeared on television’s Shark Tank, offering
10 percent of the company in exchange for a $200,000 invest-
ment. Indiana University alumnus Mark Cuban offered Pacqué 
$200,000 for one-third of CoatChex, but Pacqué refused, not 
wanting to give up that much equity so early in the life of his busi-
ness. Although Pacqué did not get the investment deal he had 
hoped for from Shark Tank, the brand exposure that CoatChex
received from appearing on the show has proved to be as valuable
as an infomercial that would cost $500,000.
While working on a master’s degree in computer science and
electrical engineering, Limor Fried enjoyed applying the skills she 
was learning in the classroom, building MP3 players and laser toys 
from custom-ordered parts. Fried posted the instructions on her 
Web site and soon was flooded with requests from people asking 
for pre-assembled kits so that they could build their own devices. 
“At first, I was like, ‘I’m really busy. Leave me alone,’” she recalls. 
Then she realized the entrepreneurial potential that selling kits 
had and convinced her parents to allow her to use $10,000 of
the money they had set aside for tuition to purchase parts in bulk, 
assemble the kits, and sell them. As word spread, the number of
orders grew, and Fried began hiring some of her friends to help 
fill them. Soon, she was designing a new project every week for 
her customers, who ranged from elementary school kids and tech
geeks to hobbyists and retirees.
Today, Fried owns Adafruit Industries, a New York City-based 
company that generates more than $10 million in annual sales by 
selling pre-assembled kits of parts for building cool objects such 
as MintyBoost, a portable USB mobile device charger made from
an Altoids tin and various electronic components (50,000 kits sold 
so far). Other popular kits include the iNecklace, which allows cus-
tomers to build a pendant shaped like the “on” button on Apple 
gadgets (complete with pulsating light), and the MaKey MaKey, 
a device that uses circuitry and alligators clips to turn anything 
that conducts electricity (bananas, plants, your dog . . .) into a
keyboard or touchpad. AdaFruit Industries’ 50 employees are con-
stantly developing new kits and shipping them worldwide.
Budding entrepreneurs at a growing number of colleges can 
take advantage of a special programs designed to create a culture 
for entrepreneurship. A growing number of schools provide on-
campus business accelerators that offer promising student entre-
preneurs amenities such as low-cost (sometimes free) office space, 
start-up funding, professionally appointed conference rooms, 
wireless Internet access, smartboards, ample computer facilities, 
videoconferencing equipment, copiers, and others. Presentations 
from entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, bankers, attorneys, and
others help students define their business ideas and develop their

The Cultural Diversity of Entrepreneurship
As we have seen, virtually anyone has the potential to become an entrepreneur. Indeed, diversity 
is a hallmark of entrepreneurship. We now explore the diverse mix of people who make up the 
rich fabric of entrepreneurship.
Young Entrepreneurs
Young people are embracing entrepreneurship enthusiastically as a career choice. A recent survey 
by the Kauffman Foundation reports that 40 percent of young people between the ages of 8 and 
24 have already started a business or would like to do so in the future. The top five reasons these 
young people want to start their own businesses include the opportunity to use their skills and
abilities, build something for their future, be their own bosses, earn lots of money, and see their 
ideas realized. Although entrepreneurial activity tends to increase with age, many members of the 
Millennial generation (or Generation Y, those people born between 1982 and 2000) show high 
levels of interest in entrepreneurship. Disenchanted with their prospects in corporate America 
and willing to take a chance at controlling their own destinies, scores of young people are choos-
ing entrepreneurship as their initial career path. People between the ages of 15 and 29, nearly 
64 million strong, are deciding that owning their own companies is the best way to create job 
security and to achieve the balance between work and life that they seek. “People are realizing 
they don’t have to go to work in suits and ties and don’t have to talk about budgets every day,” 
says Ben Kaufman, founder of Mophie, a company (named after his golden retrievers, Molly and

armbands, and belt clips. “They can have a job they like. They can create a job for themselves.”91
Because of young people such as Kaufman, the future of entrepreneurship looks very bright.
Women Entrepreneurs
Despite years of legislative effort, women still face discrimination in the workforce. However,
small business has been a leader in offering women opportunities for economic expression 
through entrepreneurship. Increasing numbers of women are discovering that the best way to 
break the “glass ceiling” that prevents them from rising to the top of many organizations is to start 
their own companies. Women entrepreneurs have even broken through the comic strip barrier. 
Blondie Bumstead, long a typical suburban housewife married to Dagwood, now owns her own 
catering business with her best friend and neighbor Tootsie Woodly!
The number of women-owned businesses is growing 1.5 times faster than the national average.92
Women now own 30.4 percent of all privately held businesses in the United States, but their com-
panies generate just 11 percent of business sales.93 Although women-owned businesses are smaller 
business plans. “It’s often over those late-night pizzas where the 
best ideas are born,” says one official. One student entrepreneur
in the program agrees: “A lot of it is the community. Being around
people in the [entrepreneurship] program inspires one to think 
about other opportunities out there. What I’ve learned here is
how to plan, how to make a business actually work.”

and far less likely to attract equity capital investments than those that men start, their impact is 
significant.94 The more than 9.1 million women-owned companies in the United States employ
nearly 7.9 million workers and generate sales of more than $1.4 trillion a year (see Figure 1.6)!95
A study by Guardian Life Small Business Research Institute projects that women-owned 
companies will generate between 5 million and 5.5 million jobs in the United States by 2018, 
which represents more than half the total jobs small companies will generate in that period.96
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Sophia Amoruso: Nasty Gal In 2006, 
Sophia Amoruso, just 21 years old, started a business in her garage selling 
vintage clothing on eBay. Today, Amoruso is CEO of Nasty Gal (named after a 1975 
song by Betty Davis), an online clothing store that has a “crazy, freakishly loyal”
customer base of young women who clamor to purchase the company’s vintage-
inspired clothing, much of which she purchases from up-and-coming designers. Just 
four years after launch, Nasty Gal’s annual sales hit $128 million, a dramatic in-
crease from its first-year sales of $223,000. Nasty Gal now has 300 employees, a
10,000-square-foot headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, and a 50,000-square-
foot warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky. Amoruso recently launched a mobile Web
site, a Super Nasty magazine, and an in-house brand that includes collections of
y
dresses, tops, jeans, swimwear, and more. Amoruso’s goal is to transform Nasty Gal 
from a mere retailer to a full-fledged brand. She revels in meeting the challenges 
that a fast-growing business present, saying that the business changes so quickly, it 
is almost like working for a new business each month.97 ■
Minority Enterprises
Another rapidly growing segment of the small business population is minority-
owned businesses. Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians are the minority
groups that are most likely to be entrepreneurs. Hispanics, who now make up the largest minority
population in the United States, own 8.5 percent of all businesses. African Americans, who make

up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, own 7 percent of all businesses, and Asians own
5.9 percent of all businesses.98 Minority-owned businesses have come a long way in the last two
decades (see Figure 1.7), however, and their success rate is climbing.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Britta Aragon: Cinco Vidas SkinLabs Inspired by her 
father’s battle with cancer, Britta Aragon, a cancer survivor herself, worked with a team of 
leading dermatologists, toxicologists, and holistic skin-care chemists to develop a line of nontoxic 
skin care products that soothe, repair, and hydrate skin that has been damaged by the devastating 
effects of cancer treatments, skin sensitivity, or skin disorders such as eczema. To sell her innova-
tive products, the former skin care therapist and makeup artist launched Cinco Vidas (“Five Lives” 
in Spanish) SkinLabs in New York City in 2008. “After I went through cancer and later lost my
father to the disease, I knew that my purpose was to make a difference for other people going 
through similar challenges—whether from cancer or from battling a variety of skin conditions,”
says Aragon. “Sometimes in tragedy, we find our life’s purpose.”99 ■
Minority entrepreneurs own 22.5 percent of all businesses, and their economic impact is
significant. Minority-owned businesses generate $871 billion in annual revenues and employ
more than 5.9 million workers.100 The future is promising for this new generation of minority
entrepreneurs, who are better educated, have more business experience, and are better prepared 
for business ownership than their predecessors.
Immigrant Entrepreneurs
The United States, which has long been a melting pot of diverse cultures, is the leading destina-
tion in the world for immigrants drawn to this nation by its promise of economic freedom and 
prosperity. The immigrant population in the United States is more diverse than in the past, with 
people coming from a larger number of countries. In 1960, 75 percent of the foreign-born popu-
lation came from Europe; today, most immigrants come from Mexico, and just 12 percent of the 
immigrant population emigrates from Europe.101 Unlike the unskilled “huddled masses” of the

past, today’s 40.4 million immigrants, which make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, arrive 
with more education and experience and often a desire to start a business of their own.102 In fact, 
immigrants are significantly (1.9 times) more likely to start businesses than are native-born U.S. 
citizens.103 Immigrant entrepreneurs start their businesses with more capital than do native-born
entrepreneurs and are more likely to export goods and services than their native-born counter-
parts. Immigrant-owned businesses account for 12 percent of total business revenues; however, 
the annual sales immigrants’ businesses generate are just 71 percent of those that native-born en-
trepreneurs generate ($434,000 vs. $609,000).104 Immigrant-owned businesses play an important 
role in many key industries. In fact, immigrant entrepreneurs founded 24.3 percent of all the high
technology companies started in the United States between 2006 and 2012. These companies 
employ 560,000 workers and generate $63 billion in annual sales.105 Although many immigrants 
come to the United States with few assets, their dedication, hard work, and desire to succeed 
enable them to achieve their entrepreneurial dreams. Their impact is significant; immigrants or 
children of immigrants started 41 percent of Fortune 500 companies.106
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ruben and Rosalinda Montalvo. After emigrating to 
the United States from his native Mexico as an engineer for Gillette, Ruben Montalvo de-
cided to leave the corporate world behind and embark on a career as an entrepreneur. He 
launched his first business, Cantinflas Mexican and Vegetarian Gourmet Cuisine, a restaurant in 
Greer, South Carolina, with his wife Rosalinda using their savings and credit cards in 1994. Since
then, Montalvo has gone on to start a dozen other entrepreneurial ventures, including a healthy
quick service restaurant, Senor Wraps, a bistro in France, a real estate company, and an investment 
company. Before financing Cantinflas themselves, Montalvo says that he and Rosalinda turned to
family and friends for funding but were turned down. At the time, having to rely on only on their 
own capital seemed to be an obstacle, but, looking back, Motalvo says it turned out to be a bless-
ing. Montalvo admits that starting a business requires one to step out on faith, but he knows that 
it was the right decision for him. Like most entrepreneurs, Montalvo sees needs—and business 
opportunities—everywhere that serve as open doors for new business ventures.107 ■
Part-Time Entrepreneurs
Starting a part-time business is a popular gateway to entrepreneurship. Part-time entrepreneurs
have the best of both worlds: They can ease into business for themselves without sacrificing the 
security of a steady paycheck and benefits. The Internet (and particularly eBay) and mobile com-
munication devices make establishing and running a part-time business very easy; many part-
time entrepreneurs run online businesses from a spare bedroom in their homes or from wherever 
they are.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Anthony Lau: Cyclehoop When Anthony Lau was a stu-
dent at London’s University College, a thief stole his bicycle even though he had chained it
to a signpost on one of the city’s busy streets. A short time later, the architectural student noticed 
a design competition for a secure bicycle parking solution and began researching the problem. He 
came up with a simple yet effective design involving two simple hoops that proved to be easy to 
use and hard for thieves to defeat. He entered his design in the competition and won. After win-
ning the competition, Lau launched a part-time business, Cyclehoop, which he financed with his 
own money, from his bedroom to market his invention. He landed contracts for the Cyclehoop 
from two London boroughs, Islington and Southwark, and went on to win several business plan 
competitions. Lau learns something from each business plan competition he enters and uses the
feedback he gets to refine his ideas and business model. Today, Cyclehoop generates annual sales 
of £1.7 million and boasts an international presence, exporting its products to markets all over the 
world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Sweden, and many 
others. Lau also worked with a partner, Jessica Lee, to win a competition to design an indoor
bicycle shed for Google’s New York City office that he also plans to bring to market. Lau and Lee
came up with a system for storing bicycles vertically, stacking them on two levels and suspending 
them from the ceiling, which conserves space.108 ■
A major advantage of going into business part-time is the lower risk in case the venture flops. 
Many part-timers are “testing the entrepreneurial waters” to see whether their business ideas 
will work, whether there is sufficient demand for their products and services, and whether they
enjoy being self-employed. As they grow, many successful part-time enterprises absorb more of 

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
45
entrepreneurs’ time until they become full-time businesses. Starting part-time businesses on a
small scale means that entrepreneurs can finance their companies themselves, allowing them to 
retain complete ownership.
Home-Based Businesses
Home-based businesses are booming! An entrepreneur starts a home-based business on aver-
age every 12 seconds.109 Fifty-two percent of all small businesses are home based, and half of 
these have at least one employee, which means that home-based companies employ 13.2 million 
workers (including the owner).110 Home-based businesses are an important economic force; they 
generate $427 billion a year in sales.111 Several factors make the home the first choice location 
for many entrepreneurs:
● Operating a business from home keeps start-up and operating costs to a minimum. In fact, 
44 percent of home-based entrepreneurs start their businesses for less than $5,000.112
● Home-based companies allow owners to maintain flexible life and work styles. Many 
home-based entrepreneurs relish being part of the “open-collar workforce.”
● Technology, which is transforming many ordinary homes into “electronic cottages,” allows 
entrepreneurs to run a wide variety of businesses from their homes.
● Many entrepreneurs use the Internet to operate e-commerce businesses from their homes 
that literally span the globe. They also rely heavily on social media to promote their home-
based businesses.
In the past, home-based businesses tended to be rather mundane cottage industries, such as
making crafts or sewing. Today’s home-based businesses are more diverse; modern “homepre-
neurs” are more likely to be running high-tech or service companies with annual sales of hundreds 
of thousands of dollars. Twenty percent of home-based businesses generate between $100,000 and 
$500,000 in annual revenue.113
Family Businesses
A family-owned business is one that includes two or more members of a family with financial 
control of the company. Family businesses are an integral part of our economy. Of the nearly 
28 million businesses in the United States, 90 percent are family owned and managed. These 
companies account for 62 percent of total employment in the United States and 78 percent of all 
new jobs, pay 65 percent of all wages, and generate 64 percent of the nation’s GDP. Not all of 
them are small; 33 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are family businesses.114
“When it works right,” says one writer, “nothing succeeds like a family firm. The roots run deep, 
embedded in family values. The flash of the fast buck is replaced with long-term plans. Tradition 
counts.”115 Indeed, the lifespan of the typical family business is 24 years.116 Despite their magnitude, 
family businesses face a major threat, a threat from within: management succession. In a recent 
survey by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, one-third of family business owners expressed apprehension
about transferring the business to the next generation, and 9 percent of owners saw the potential for 
family conflict as a result of the transition.117 Only 30 percent of family businesses survive to the 
second generation, just 12 percent make it to the third generation, and only 3 percent survive into the 
fourth generation and beyond. Business periodicals are full of stories describing bitter feuds among 
family members that have crippled or destroyed once thriving businesses. The co-owner of one family 
business explains the challenges of operating a family business this way: “The best part is working
with family. The worst part is working with family.”118 To avoid the senseless destruction of thriving
family businesses, owners should do the following:
● Work to build positive relationships among family members both at and away from work
● Demonstrate respect for other family members’ abilities and talents
● Separate responsibilities in the company based on each person’s interests, abilities, and talents
● Develop plans for minimizing the potentially devastating effects of estate taxes
● Develop plans for management succession long before retirement looms before them

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Antonio, Mario, and Robert Pasin: Radio Flyer Since
1917, millions of children have played with red Radio Flyer wagons. At age 16, Antonio 
Pasin, the son of an immigrant cabinet maker, started a business, The Liberty Coaster Company, 
making wooden wagons in a Chicago workshop. Several years later, Pasin opened his own fac-
tory and began making his wagons from metal and called them Radio Flyers. “They were sim-
ply the buzzwords of the day,” explains Robert Pasin, Antonio’s grandson, who now runs the
company. Antonio retired from the family business when he was in his 70s, turning the com-
pany over to his son, Mario, who expanded the product line and renamed the business Radio 
Flyer. In 1997, Mario turned over the reins of the family business to his son, Robert, who also
introduced new products, including tricycles, scooters, training bikes, and a line of wagons
made from plastic that customers can trick out with a plethora of nifty options. The third-
generation family business is still going strong with 70 employees and more than $100 million 
in annual sales.119 ■
Copreneurs
Copreneurs are entrepreneurial couples who work together as co-owners of their businesses. 
Nearly 4 million couples operate businesses together in the United States, but unlike the tradi-
tional “Mom and Pop” (Pop as “boss” and Mom as “subordinate”), copreneurs “create a divi-
sion of labor that is based on expertise as opposed to gender,” says one expert.120 Managing a
small business with a spouse may appear to be a recipe for divorce, but most copreneurs say not. 
Caterina Fake, who with her husband Sewart Butterfield launched Flickr, a photo-sharing Web 
site, says that sharing with someone you love the intensity of launching a business, with its long
hours, terrifying moments of despair, crushing defeats, joyous victories, and raging uncertainty, 
brings a couple closer together.121 Successful copreneurs learn to build the foundation for a suc-
cessful working relationship before they ever launch their companies. Some of the characteristics
they rely on include the following:
● An assessment of whether their personalities will mesh—or conflict—in a business 
setting
● Mutual respect for each other and one another’s talents
● Compatible business and life goals—a common vision
● Similar work ethic
● A view that they are full and equal partners, not a superior and a subordinate
● Complementary business skills that each acknowledges and appreciates and that lead to a 
unique business identity for each spouse
● The ability to keep lines of communication open, talking and listening to each other about 
personal as well as business issues
● A clear division of roles and authority, ideally based on each partner’s skills and abilities, 
to minimize conflict and power struggles
● The ability to encourage each other and to lift up a disillusioned partner
● Separate work spaces that allow them to escape when the need arises
● Boundaries between their business life and their personal life so that one doesn’t consume 
the other
● A sense of humor
● The realization that not every couple can work together
Although copreneuring isn’t for everyone, it works extremely well for many couples and
often leads to successful businesses. Both spouses work for a common purpose and bring their 
unique talents to the business. Combining their skills with their dedication to the company pro-
duces a synergistic effect, in which one plus one equals more than two.122

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: David Horvath and Sun-Min Kim After graduation in
2001, David Horvath sent a letter to his college sweetheart, Sun-Min Kim, who had re-
turned to Korea because her student visa had expired, and signed it with a silly drawing of a wide-
eyed monster with long arms, fangs, stubby legs, and a large head. As a surprise, Kim took the
drawing and made it into a plush, hand-sewn doll. Horvath happened to show the funny creature
to a friend who owned a toy store in Los Angeles, who was intrigued and ordered 20 dolls, which 
sold quickly. When Horvath’s friend called to order more dolls, the couple, who were married in
2005, began designing a collection of brightly colored dolls based on an “Ugly-verse” of 60 char-
acters they created. Orders trickled—and then poured—in, and the copreneurs started Pretty Ugly 
LLC to market their line of dolls. Today, Pretty Ugly, which is based in Green Brook, New Jersey, 
employs a dozen workers and sells a complete line of Uglydolls, books, games, apparel, accesso-
ries, and other items in more than 10,000 retail stores worldwide. The company Horvath and Kim 
started together has generated sales of more than $100 million and sells more than 2 million 
Uglydolls-branded items each year.123 ■
Corporate Castoffs
Concentrating on shedding the excess bulk that took away their flexibility and speed, many 
large American corporations have been downsizing in an attempt to regain their competitive 
edge. For decades, one major corporation after another has announced layoffs—and not just 
among blue-collar workers. According to placement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, 
from 2002 to 2012, corporations laid off an average of 80,200 employees per month.124
Executives and line workers alike have experienced job cuts, and these corporate castoffs 
have become an important source of entrepreneurial activity. Some 20 percent of discharged 
corporate managers have become entrepreneurs, and many of those left behind in corporate 
America would like to join them. “There is really no safe job anymore,” says Marty Bauer, 
who left the banking industry to launch a start-up business after he witnessed one of his men-
tors being laid off just three years before he was to retire. Bauer and three friends started 
RidePost, a Web site that allows travelers to meet and find safe rides from one destination to
another.125
Many corporate castoffs are deciding that the best defense against future job insecurity is an 
entrepreneurial offense. Accustomed to the support of the corporations they left, many corporate 
castoffs decide to purchase franchises, where there is a built-in management system already in 
place. Entrepreneur magazine surveyed the companies on its Franchise 500 list recently and 
r
discovered that 77 percent of franchisors report that “second-career executives” (i.e., corporate
castoffs) are among the primary purchasers of their franchises.126
Corporate Dropouts
The dramatic downsizing of corporate America has created another effect among the employees 
left after restructuring: a trust gap. The result of this trust gap is a growing number of dropouts
from the corporate structure who then become entrepreneurs. Although their workdays may grow 
longer and their incomes may shrink, those who strike out on their own often find their work 
more rewarding and more satisfying because they are doing what they enjoy. Other entrepreneurs 
are inspired to launch their companies after being treated unfairly by large, impersonal corporate 
entities.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Olivia DeCastro: A Public Affair PR and Diana Classic 
Children After graduating from college, Olivia DeCastro embarked on a career in 
corporate America, first with an advertising agency and then as public relations director for a 
large hospital system. However, DeCastro became disenchanted with the limitations that 
corporate hierarchies imposed and wanted to control her own destiny. In 2010, the 25-year-old 
set aside a promising corporate career to launch her own public relations firm, A Public Affair
PR, and an upscale children’s clothing boutique, Diana Classic Children, in Palm Beach Gardens,
Florida. “I didn’t feel like I had freedom in the corporate world,” says DeCastro. Within two 
years, A Public Affair PR had a staff of six and offices in Miami, Florida, and Greenville, South
Carolina.127 ■

48
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Because they have college degrees, a working knowledge of business, and years of manage-
ment experience, both corporate dropouts and castoffs may ultimately increase the small busi-
ness survival rate. A recent survey by Manta, an online small business community, reports that 
69 percent of small business owners have college degrees, and 61 percent say a college degree
was important to their business success.128 Better-trained, more experienced entrepreneurs are
more likely to succeed.
Retiring Baby Boomers
Because people are living longer and are remaining active as they grow older, the ranks of older 
entrepreneurs are growing. In fact, according to studies by the Kauffman Foundation, the level 
of entrepreneurial activity among people ages 55 to 64 actually exceeds that of people ages 
20 to 34 (see Figure 1.8). The average age of the first-time entrepreneurs in the United States 
is nearly 44.129 One advantage that older entrepreneurs have is wisdom that has been forged by 
experience.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Don Shula: Shula’s Steak Houses, LLC At age 64, Don 
Shula, retired National Football League coach and Pro Football Hall of Fame member, and
several members of his family, including his son Dave who was also an NFL coach, started a restau-
rant company, Shula’s Steak Houses, LLC. The coaching legend, who racked up 347 career wins and 
is the only coach to complete a perfect season in the NFL, applies the same work ethic to the res-
taurant business and now has more than 30 restaurants across the United States. In addition to 
14 Shula’s Steak Houses, the Shulas also own four Shula’s Bar and Grills, one Shula’s On the Beach, 
two Shula’s 2 Steak and Sports, and eight Shula’s 347 Grills. The family’s most recent start-up is 
Shula Burger, an upscale burger eatery that features patties made from a combination of fresh
steak and ground beef, veggie burgers, turkey burgers, a large menu of side items, and an impres-
sive wine list. The décor is all sports, with sports events playing on large-screen televisions, foot-
ball memorabilia, and massive paintings of favorite plays from Shula’s playing and coaching days.
“I’m just a guy who rolls up his sleeves and goes to work,” says Shula, now 83. “The bottom line 
in coaching is winning. The bottom line in the restaurant business is winning. You want to win 
every meal.”130 ■

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
49
Collegiate entrepreneurs are becoming increasingly common as
colleges and universities offer more courses and a greater variety 
of courses in the areas of entrepreneurship and small business 
management. Launching a business while in college offers many 
advantages, including access to research and valuable advice, but
starting an entrepreneurial career also poses challenges, including 
a lack of financial resources, business experience, and time. What
are some of the most common myths that prevent young people 
(not just college students) from launching businesses?
•
I don’t have enough money to launch a business. One
of the greatest benefits of the shift in the United States to 
a service economy is that service businesses usually are 
inexpensive to start. One young entrepreneur worked with a 
friend to launch a Web development company while in high 
school, and their total start-up cost was just $80.
•
I don’t have enough time. Many companies that have grown 
into successful, mature businesses were started by entrepre-
neurs in their spare time. Everyone has the same 24 hours 
in a day. What matters is what you do with those hours.
•
I’m not smart enough to start a company. SAT scores 
and grades have little correlation to one’s ability to launch 
a successful business. Quite a few successful entrepreneurs, 
including Michael Dell (Dell Inc.), Richard Branson (Virgin), 
Walt Disney (Disney), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), and 
Debbi Fields (Mrs. Fields Cookies), dropped out of college 
to start their businesses.
•
I’m not majoring in business. Success in entrepreneur-
ship is not limited to students who earn business degrees. 
Anyone has the potential to be a successful entrepreneur. 
At the University of Miami, only 20 percent of the students 
who have participated in The Launch Pad, the school’s
start-up accelerator, have been business majors.
•
I’m not creative enough to come up with a good idea for 
a business. As you will learn in Chapter 3, everyone has the 
potential to be creative. Some of the most successful businesses 
are the result of an entrepreneur who recognized a simple need 
that people had and created a business to meet that need.
•
I don’t have any experience. Neither did Bill Gates 
(Microsoft) and Michael Dell (Dell Inc.) when they launched 
their companies, and things worked out pretty well for both 
of them. Business experience can be an important factor 
in a company’s success, but every entrepreneur has to start 
somewhere to gain that experience.
•
I might fail. Failure is a possibility. In fact, the survival rate 
of new companies after five years is 51 percent. Ask your-
self this: What is the worst that can happen if I launch a 
business and it fails? Entrepreneurs do not allow the fear 
of failure to stop them from trying to realize their dreams.
If you want to become a successful collegiate entrepreneur, 
what can you do to increase the chances of your success? The 
following tips will help.
Recognize That Starting a Business at an Early 
Age May Be to Your Advantage
Young people tend to be highly creative, and that can provide
your company with a competitive advantage. In addition, young 
people often accomplish things simply because they don’t know 
that they are not supposed to be able to do them!
Build a Business Plan
One of the best ways to lower the probability that your business will
fail is to create a business plan. Doing so forces you to ask and then 
answer some tough questions about your idea and your proposed
venture. “It’s all about ‘derisking’ your idea,” says Gregg Fairbrothers, 
who teaches entrepreneurship at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Busi-
ness. “Identifying, unblinkingly, what could go wrong and taking 
whatever steps necessary to slash the odds that it will.”
Use All of the Resources Available to You
Many colleges and universities now offer courses in entrepreneur-r
ship and small business management and have faculty members
who are experts in the field. In many cases, the people who are 
teaching these classes are veteran entrepreneurs themselves with 
tremendous reservoirs of knowledge and experience. Some colleges 
provide special dorms for budding entrepreneurs that serve as busi-
ness incubators. Smart collegiate entrepreneurs tap into the pool of 
resources that their campuses offer.
Don’t Go It Alone
Research from MIT’s Sloan School of Business suggests that starting 
a business with cofounders increases the company’s probability of
success. Each additional founder up to four increases the likelihood 
that a start-up will succeed. “Two or three cofounders seems to be 
the sweet spot,” says one expert. Another study reports that solo 
entrepreneurs take 3.6 times as long to launch than teams of two
or more cofounders. Cofounders bring complementary skill sets to 
the venture, share the burden of the huge volume of work required 
to launch, and provide an important support system when things 
get tough. Four students at MIT who met at the school’s entre-
preneurship center launched Ministry of Supply (MoS), a company
whose goal is to revolutionize men’s business clothing by adding 
“tech under the hood.” Aman Advani, Kit Hickey, Kevin Rustagi, 
and Gihan Amarasiriwardena pooled their individual talents to cre-
ate garments that incorporate high-tech fabrics that regulate the 
wearer’s body heat, wick moisture, and neutralize bacteria that 
cause body odor. MoS, whose products are based on technology 
used to keep astronauts comfortable in space, began by selling
men’s shirts but has added a line of high-tech T-shirts and pants.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
The Power of “Small” Business
Of the 27.9 million businesses in the United States, approximately 27.8 million, or 99.7 percent, 
are considered small. Although there is no universal definition of a small business (the U.S.
Small Business Administration has more than 800 definitions of a small business based on in-
dustry categories), a common delineation of a small business is one that employs fewer than 
100 people. They thrive in virtually every industry, although the majority of small companies are 
concentrated in the service, construction, and retail industries (see Figure 1.9). Although they 
small business
one that employs fewer 
than 100 people.
Find a Mentor
Most young entrepreneurs have not had the opportunity to gain a 
wealth of business experience, but they do have access to mentors
who do. Mike Brown, who recently won the top prize at the annual 
Global Student Entrepreneur Awards for his company ModBargains
.com, a business that sells aftermarket products for modifying cars
and trucks, says his first boss, who owns several businesses, served
as his mentor. ModBargains.com, which Brown started with fellow 
car enthusiast Ron Hay, now has more than 4,000 products avail-
able and has surpassed annual sales of $1 million.
Learn to Be a “Bootstrapper”
Learning to start and manage a company with few resources is 
good training for any entrepreneur. In the early days of their start-
ups, many successful entrepreneurs find creative ways to finance 
their businesses and to keep their operating expenses as low 
as possible. Because they lack the deep pockets of their larger 
rivals, entrepreneurs must use their creativity, ingenuity, and street 
smarts to market their companies effectively.
Manage Your Time Wisely
Taking college classes and running a business place a large work-
load on any collegiate entrepreneur, one that demands good time 
management skills. The most successful entrepreneurs recognize 
the importance of controlling their schedules (as much as possible) 
and working as efficiently as they can.
Remember to Have Fun
College is supposed to be one of the best times of your life! Start-
ing and running a business also can be one of the most rewarding 
experiences of your life. Doing both can double the fun, but it also 
can create a great deal of stress. Balance is the key.

may be small businesses, their contributions to the economy are anything but small. For exam-
ple, small companies employ 49.2 percent of the nation’s private sector workforce, even though 
they possess less than one-fourth of total business assets. Almost 90 percent of businesses with 
paid employees are small, employing fewer than 20 workers, but small companies account for 
43 percent of total private payroll in the United States. Because they are primarily labor intensive, 
small businesses actually create more jobs than do big businesses. In fact, between 1993 and 
2013, small companies created 63 percent of the net new jobs in the U.S. economy.131
The ability to create jobs is not distributed evenly across the small business sector, however.
Research shows that the top-performing 5 percent of small companies create 67 percent of the net 
new jobs in the economy, and they do so across all industry sectors, not just in “hot” industries,
such as high-tech. These young, job-creating small companies are known as gazelles, businesses 
that grow at 20 percent or more per year for four years with at least $100,000 in annual sales.
Nearly 85 percent of these high-impact companies are located in urban areas. Not surprisingly, 
cities with high levels of entrepreneurial activity boast higher levels of job creation than those 
that are home to heavier concentrations of existing businesses.132 “Mice” are small companies
that never grow much and don’t create many jobs. The majority of small companies are mice.133
In fact, 75 percent of small business owners say they are not seeking rapid growth for their busi-
nesses and want to keep them small.134 The country’s largest businesses, “elephants,” have con-
tinued to shed jobs for several years.135
Small businesses also produce 46 percent of the country’s private GDP and account for 
47 percent of business sales.136 In fact, the U.S. small business sector is the world’s third-largest 
“economy,” trailing only the entire U.S. economy and China! One business writer describes the United 
States as “an entrepreneurial economy, a system built on nimble, low-overhead small companies with 
fluid workforces, rather than the massive conglomerates that upheld the economy for decades.”137
Small companies also are incubators of new ideas, products, and services. Small firms create 
16 times more patents per employee than large companies.138 Traditionally, small businesses have
played a vital role in innovation, and they continue to do so today. Many important inventions 
trace their roots to an entrepreneur, including the zipper, laser, brassiere, escalator, light bulb,
personal computer, automatic transmission, air conditioning, and FM radio.
Putting Failure into Perspective
Because of their limited resources, inexperienced management, and lack of financial stability, 
small businesses suffer relatively high mortality rates. As you learned earlier in this chapter, two 
years after start-up, 34 percent of small companies have failed, and after five years, 51 percent 
have failed.139 Figure 1.10 shows the failure rate for small businesses over time, clear evidence 
of the constant “churn” that exists as entrepreneurs create new businesses and others close. New
companies that replace old ones with better ideas, market approaches, and products actually are 
a sign of a healthy, entrepreneurial economy.
Because they are building businesses in an environment filled with uncertainty and shaped 
by rapid change, entrepreneurs recognize that failure is likely to be part of their lives, but they
are not paralyzed by that fear. “The excitement of building a new business from scratch is greater 
than the fear of failure,” says one entrepreneur who failed in business several times before finally
succeeding.140 Entrepreneurs use their failures as a rallying point and as a means of refocusing 
their business ventures for success. They see failure for what it really is: an opportunity to learn 
what does not work! Successful entrepreneurs have the attitude that failures are simply stepping-
stones along the path to success. Basketball legend Michael Jordan displayed the same attitude.
“I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career,” he says. “I lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six
times, I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and 
over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”141
Failure is a natural part of the creative process. The only people who never fail are those who 
never do anything or never attempt anything new. Baseball fans know that Babe Ruth held the rec-
ord for career home runs (714) for many years, but how many know that he also held the record 
for strikeouts (1,330)? Successful entrepreneurs know that hitting an entrepreneurial home run
requires a few business strikeouts along the way, and they are willing to accept them. Failure is
an inevitable part of being an entrepreneur, and true entrepreneurs don’t quit when they fail. One

entrepreneur whose business burned through $800 million of investors’ money before folding 
says, “If you’re an entrepreneur, you don’t give up when times get tough.”142
One hallmark of successful entrepreneurs is the ability to fail intelligently, learning why 
they failed so that they can avoid making the same mistake again. James Dyson, whose company 
makes one of the best-selling vacuum cleaners in the world, made 5,127 prototypes of his bagless 
vacuum cleaner before he hit on one that worked. Dyson points out that he failed 5,126 times but 
that he learned from each failure. Each failure brought him closer to a successful solution, so, 
to him, failure is nothing to fear; it is part of the creative process.143 Like Dyson, entrepreneurs 
know that business success depends on their ability not to avoid making mistakes but rather to be 
open to the lessons that each mistake teaches. They learn from their failures and use them as fuel 
to push themselves closer to their ultimate target. “Failure can teach not only what one is doing 
wrong but also how to do it right the next time,” says one business writer. “It can be a useful, 
even transformational, force for better business practices. It is best not to shove it under the rug 
because it is, at some point, inevitable.”144 Entrepreneurs are less worried about what they might 
lose if they try something and fail than about what they might lose if they fail to try.
Entrepreneurial success requires both persistence and resilience, the ability to bounce back 
from failure. Thomas Edison, who earned 1,093 patents (a record that still stands), discovered 
about 1,800 ways not to build a light bulb before hitting on a design that worked. “Results!” 
Edison once exclaimed. “I have gotten a lot of results. I know several thousand things that won’t 
work.”145 Walt Disney was fired from a newspaper job because, according to his boss, he “lacked 
imagination and had no good ideas.” Disney also went bankrupt several times before he created 
Disneyland. R. H. Macy failed in business seven times before his retail store in New York City 
became a success. In the spirit of true entrepreneurship, these visionary business leaders refused 
to give up in the face of failure; they simply kept trying until they achieved success. When it 
comes to failure, entrepreneurs’ motto seems to be, Failure is temporary; quitting is permanent.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ziver Birg: Zivelo When Ziver Birg was an 18-year-old stu-
dent at Arizona State University, he started Afforablekiosks.com, an online business that sold 
kiosks to other companies. His business grew, and Birg raised $3 million in equity capital to build his own
manufacturing operation. The financing was supposed to last his company three years, but Birg burned 
through it in just nine months and ended up closing the business. Undaunted, Birg was back in business 
18 months later with his second kiosk company, Zivelo. Today, Zivelo has 20 employees, generates an-
nual revenue of $4 million, and is about to build a 100,000-square-foot manufacturing facility.146 ■

How to Avoid the Pitfalls
Although failure can be a valuable part of the entrepreneurial process, no one sets out to fail in 
business. Now we must examine the ways to avoid becoming another failure statistic and gain
insight into what makes a successful business.
Know Your Business in Depth
We have already emphasized the need for the right type of experience in the business you plan 
to start. Get the best education in your business area you possibly can before you set out on your 
own. Become a serious student of your industry. Read everything you can—trade journals, busi-
ness periodicals, books, and research reports—relating to your industry and learn what it takes 
to succeed in it. Personal contact with suppliers, customers, trade associations, and others in the 
same industry is another excellent way to get that knowledge. Smart entrepreneurs join industry 
trade associations and attend trade shows to pick up valuable information and to make key con-
tacts before they open their doors for business.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Steve Ells: Chipotle Mexican Grill Steve Ells has had a
passion for food his entire life. As a child, while his friends watched cartoons, he watched
cooking shows starring famous chefs Julia Child and Graham Kerr, the Galloping Gourmet. “In 
grammar school, I learned how to make hollandaise from my Mom, and in high school, I started
throwing dinner parties and collecting cookbooks,” he recalls. After graduating from the Univer-
sity of Colorado in Boulder, he enrolled in the Culinary Institute of America to refine his cooking
skills. From there, he moved to San Francisco, where he worked at Stars, a restaurant that launched 
the careers of many renowned chefs, and learned the details of operating a restaurant. One day,
while dining in a small taqueria in the Mission district of San Francisco, Ells noted the volume of
customers the restaurant handled and the system it used to serve them extremely efficiently.
Inspired by the experience, Ells decided to return to Denver, Colorado, where he launched the first 
Chipotle Mexican Grill in 1993 with the help of an $85,000 loan from his father. “My friends and
family thought I was crazy,” recalls Ells, “but I had a very clear vision of the way Chipotle was 
going to look and taste and feel. It was going to incorporate all of the things I had learned while
at the Culinary Institute and at Stars.” Ells’s knowledge and experience in the restaurant industry
has paid off. Today, Chipotle, a publicly held company, has nearly 1,600 restaurants and generates
more than $3.2 billion in annual sales!147 ■
Build a Viable Business Model—and Test It
Before launching a business, an entrepreneur should define the business model on which he or 
she plans to build a company and test it, preferably with actual customers or potential custom-
ers, to verify that it can be successful. Grand assumptions about capturing market share and 
“hockey stick” revenue growth that never materialize have been the downfall of many start-up 
businesses. Creating a successful business model requires entrepreneurs to identify all of the 
model’s vital components, including the resources, the partners, the activities they must as-
semble, the customer segments they are targeting, the channels they will use to reach them, the
value proposition they offer customers, and the sources of revenue and accompanying costs they 
will incur.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Justin Mares: RoommateFit After encountering the 
“classic horrible roommate” experience when he enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, 
Justin Mares thought he could come up with a better way to match roommates with the technol-
ogy used by online dating sites than the scant questionnaires most colleges use. To test the feasi-
bility of his idea, Mares researched and developed a basic screening model and pitched his idea to 
100 college administrators, who expressed a great deal of interest in the service. “Schools are
concerned about retention, and this is one tool that can increase student satisfaction,”148 he says.
Using a prize he won from the Collegiate Entrepreneurs’ Organization, Mares worked with a
psychologist to hone his software, which he named RoommateFit and which measures a variety of
personality traits. To test his business model, Mares convinced officials at Ohio University to par-
ticipate in a pilot study, and the results not only were impressive but also gave him the hard data
he needed to demonstrate RoommateFit’s effectiveness. Out of the 1,000 freshmen who used 
RoommateFit, 40 percent planned to stay with their roommates the following year. Mares then
applied for a slot in a Pittsburgh business accelerator, AlphaLab. AlphaLab accepted the start-up

and provided Mares with $30,000 in start-up funds, office space, and access to office equipment. 
Within six months, Mares had signed three more universities, which license RoommateFit’s propri-
etary software for a fee of $2 to $3 per student. In addition to marketing RoommateFit to other 
colleges and universities, the young entrepreneur also is planning to launch a consumer version 
for roommate-seekers in New York City and San Francisco.149 ■
We will discuss the process of building and testing a business model in Chapter 4.
Develop a Solid Business Plan
If an entrepreneur’s business model passes the feasibility test, the next step is to prepare a busi-
ness plan. For any entrepreneur, a well-written business plan is a crucial ingredient in preparing 
for business success. Without a sound business plan, a company merely drifts along without any
real direction. Yet entrepreneurs, who tend to be people of action, too often jump right into a busi-
ness venture without taking time to prepare a written plan outlining the essence of the business. 
Not only does a plan provide a pathway to success, but it also creates a benchmark against which
an entrepreneur can measure actual company performance. Building a successful business begins
with implementing a sound business plan with laser-like focus.
A business plan allows entrepreneurs to replace sometimes-faulty assumptions with facts
before making the decision to go into business. The planning process forces entrepreneurs to 
ask and then answer some difficult, challenging, and crucial questions about target customers, 
market potential, competition, costs of doing business, pricing, realistic revenue forecasts, and 
other matters.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Frank Mobley: Immedion At 43, Frank Mobley bowed
to his independent streak, left a well-paying steady job with a successful data solutions 
business, and started his own data support and security company, Immedion. Building on his
experience in the telecommunications and data solutions industries, Mobley saw a growing
need among mid-size companies for reliable servers that could store data securely and keep
companies’ Web sites up and running under any circumstances. He spent two months writing a
business plan, which was all he had to convince investors to put up the $2.5 million he needed
to launch Immedion. Mobley was able to use the business plan to sell his idea to investors, in-
cluding friends, family members, and even his former employers. When Mobley started his
company in Greenville, South Carolina, he had one data center and no clients. Today, Immedion 
has four data centers, 300 clients, and is growing rapidly. Mobley considers his business to be
successful because his customers are satisfied, his investors are happy, and his employees enjoy 
their work.150 ■
We will discuss the process of developing a business plan in Chapter 5.
Understand Financial Statements
Every business owner must depend on records and financial statements to know the condition of 
his or her business. All too often, entrepreneurs use these only for tax purposes and not as vital
management control devices. To truly understand what is going on in the business, an owner must 
have at least a basic understanding of accounting and finance.
When analyzed and interpreted properly, these financial statements are reliable indicators 
of a small firm’s health. They can be quite helpful in signaling potential problems. For example, 
declining sales, slipping profits, rising debt, and deteriorating working capital are all symptoms 
of potentially lethal problems that require immediate attention. We will discuss financial state-
ment analysis in Chapter 11.
Manage Financial Resources
The best defense against financial problems is to develop a practical information system and then 
use this information to make business decisions. No entrepreneur can maintain control over a 
business unless he or she is able to judge its financial health.
The first step in managing financial resources effectively is to have adequate start-up capital. 
Too many entrepreneurs start their businesses undercapitalized. One experienced business owner 
advises, “Estimate how much capital you need to get the business going and then double that 

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
55
figure.” His point is well taken; it almost always costs more (and takes longer) to launch a busi-
ness than any entrepreneur expects. Jake Burton, founder of Burton Snowboards, a company 
that dominates the snowboard industry with 58 percent market share, made that mistake when 
he started his now successful company in 1977 straight out of college. Looking back, Burton 
acknowledges that he underestimated both the cost and the time that it would take to start the 
business, mistakes that almost cost him the business.151
The most valuable financial resource to any small business is cash. Although earning a profit 
is essential to its long-term survival, a business must have an adequate supply of cash to pay its
bills. Some entrepreneurs count on growing sales to supply their company’s cash needs, but this
almost never happens. Growing companies usually consume more cash than they generate, and the 
faster they grow, the more cash they gobble up! Business history is littered with failed companies 
whose founders had no idea how much cash their businesses were generating and were spending 
cash as if they were certain there was “plenty more where that came from.” Four years after former 
professional baseball player Curt Schilling launched 38 Studios, a company he started to produce 
massive multiplayer online games, the company ran short of cash and defaulted on a $1.1 million 
interest payment that was part of a $75 million guaranteed loan. The company soon folded, 
400 people lost their jobs, lenders lost $110 million, and Schilling himself lost $50 million.152
We will discuss cash management techniques in Chapter 12.
Learn to Manage People Effectively
No matter what kind of business you launch, you must learn to manage people. Every busi-
ness depends on a foundation of well-trained, motivated employees. No business owner can do 
everything alone. The people an entrepreneur hires ultimately determine the heights to which 
the company can climb—or the depths to which it can plunge. Attracting and retaining a corps 
of quality employees is no easy task, however. It remains a challenge for every small business 
owner. “In the end, your most dominant sustainable resource is the quality of the people you 
have,” says one small business expert.153 At Chipotle Mexican Grill, Steve Ells is quick to point 
to the company’s dedicated 45,000 employees as one key to success. “We develop our people
and promote from within,” says Ells, noting that 85 percent of Chipotle’s salaried managers and 
96 percent of its hourly managers are promoted from within the company, and many of them 
started as burrito rollers in a restaurant.154 We will discuss the techniques of managing and moti-
vating people effectively in Chapter 16.
Set Your Business Apart from the Competition
The formula for almost certain business failure involves becoming a “me-too business”—merely
copying whatever the competition is doing. Most successful entrepreneurs find a way to convince 
their customers that their companies are superior to their competitors even if they sell similar 
products or services. It is especially important for small companies going up against larger, more 
powerful rivals with greater financial resources. Ideally, the basis for differentiating a company 
from its competitors is founded in what it does best. For small companies, that basis often is
customer service, convenience, speed, quality, or whatever else is important to attracting and 
keeping satisfied customers. We will discuss the strategies for creating a unique footprint in the 
marketplace in Chapters 5 and 8.
Maintain a Positive Attitude
Achieving business success requires an entrepreneur to maintain a positive mental attitude to-
ward business and the discipline to stick with it. Successful entrepreneurs recognize that their 
most valuable resource is their time, and they learn to manage it effectively to make themselves 
and their companies more productive. None of this, of course, is possible without passion—
passion for their businesses, their products or services, their customers, and their communities.
Passion is what enables a failed business owner to get back up, try again, and make it to the top!
One business writer says growing a successful business requires entrepreneurs to have great faith 
in themselves and their ideas, great doubt concerning the challenges and inevitable obstacles 
they will face as they build their businesses, and great effort—lots of hard work—to make their 
dreams become reality.155

As you can see, entrepreneurship lies at the heart of this nation’s free enterprise system: Small 
companies truly are the backbone of our economy. Their contributions are as many and as diverse 
as the businesses themselves. Indeed, diversity is one of the strengths of the U.S. small business 
sector. Although there are no secrets to becoming a successful entrepreneur, entrepreneurs can 
take steps to enhance the probability of their success. The remainder of this book will explore 
those steps and how to apply them to the process of launching a successful business with an em-
phasis on building a sound business plan.
● Chapter 2, “Ethics and Social Responsibility,” describes a framework for making ethical 
decisions and ensuring that a business lives up to its social responsibility. Chapter 3, “In-
side the Entrepreneurial Mind: From Ideas to Reality,” explores the creative process that 
lies at the heart of entrepreneurship and offers practical tips on how you can stimulate your 
own creativity and that of your employees.
● Section 2, “The Entrepreneurial Journey Begins” (Chapters 4 to 7), discusses the classic 
start-up questions every entrepreneur faces, particularly conducting a feasibility analysis, 
creating a business model, developing a strategy, building a business plan, choosing a form
of ownership, and alternative methods for becoming a business owner (franchising and 
buying an existing business).
● Section 3, “Launching a Business” (Chapters 8 to 13), focuses first on creating an effective 
bootstrap marketing plan for a small company. These chapters address creating an effec-
tive e-commerce strategy and establishing pricing and credit strategies. This section also 
explains how to develop the financial component of a business plan, including creating 
projected financial statements and forecasting cash flow. These chapters offer existing busi-
ness owners practical financial management tools and explain how to find the sources of 
funding, both debt and equity, necessary to launch a business.
● Section 4, “Growing the Business” (Chapters 14 to 16), explains how to find the ideal 
location for a business and plan for an efficient layout and how to penetrate global markets
t
successfully. This section also provides useful techniques for assembling a strong new
venture team and leading its members to success and discusses the importance of creating a
management succession plan to ensure that a company successfully makes the transition to 
the next generation of owners.
As you can see, the journey down the road of entrepreneurship will be fascinating and excit-
ing. Let’s get started!
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Define the role of the entrepreneur in business 
in the United States and around the world.
Entrepreneurship is thriving in the United States, but 
the current wave of entrepreneurship is not limited 
to the United States; many nations across the globe 
are seeing similar growth in their small business sec-
tors. A variety of competitive, economic, and demo-
graphic shifts have created a world in which “small is 
beautiful.”
Capitalist societies depend on entrepreneurs to 
provide the drive and risk taking necessary for the 
system to supply people with the goods and services 
they need.
2. Describe the entrepreneurial profile.
Entrepreneurs have some common characteristics,
including a desire for responsibility, a preference for 
moderate risk, confidence in their ability to succeed, 
desire for immediate feedback, a high energy level, a 
future orientation, skill at organizing, and a value of 
achievement over money. In a phrase, they are tena-
cious high achievers.
3A. Describe the benefits of entrepreneurship.
Driven by these personal characteristics, entrepreneurs 
establish and manage small businesses to gain con-
trol over their lives, make a difference in the world, 

CHAPTER 1 • THE FOUNDATIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP

become self-fulfilled, reap unlimited profits, contrib-
ute to society, and do what they enjoy doing.
3B. Describe the drawbacks of entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurs also face certain disadvantages, includ-
ing uncertainty of income, the risk of losing their 
investments (and more), long hours and hard work, a 
lower quality of life until the business gets established,
high stress levels, and complete decision-making
responsibility.
4. Explain the forces that are driving the growth 
of entrepreneurship.
Several factors are driving the boom in entrepreneur-
ship, including the portrayal of entrepreneurs as he-
roes, better entrepreneurial education, economic and 
demographic factors, a shift to a service economy,
technological advances, more independent lifestyles, 
and increased international opportunities.
5. Explain the cultural diversity of entrepreneurship.
Several groups are leading the nation’s drive toward 
entrepreneurship: young people, women, minorities, 
immigrants, part-timers, home-based business owners, 
family business owners, copreneurs, corporate cast-
offs, corporate dropouts, social entrepreneurs, 
and retired baby boomers.
6. Describe the important role that small 
businesses play in our nation’s economy.
The small business sector’s contributions are many.
They make up 99.7 percent of all businesses, employ 
49.2 percent of the private sector workforce, have 
created nearly two-thirds of the net new jobs in the 
economy, produce 46 percent of the country’s 
private GDP, and account for 47 percent of all busi-
ness sales.
7. Put failure into the proper perspective.
Entrepreneurs recognize that failure is a natural part of 
the creative process. Successful entrepreneurs have the 
attitude that failures are simply stepping-stones along 
the path to success, and they refuse to be paralyzed by 
a fear of failure.
8. Explain how an entrepreneur can avoid 
becoming another failure statistic.
Entrepreneurs can employ several general tactics to 
avoid these pitfalls. They should know their busi-
nesses in depth, prepare a solid business plan, manage 
financial resources effectively, understand financial 
statements, learn to manage people, set their businesses 
apart from the competition, and maintain a positive 
attitude.

Doing the Right Thing

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Business ethics involves the moral values and behavioral standards that businesspeople draw on 
as they make decisions and solve problems. It originates in a commitment to do what is right.
Ethical behavior—doing what is “right” as opposed to what is “wrong”—starts with the entre-
preneur. The entrepreneur’s personal values begin to shape the business from day one. Entrepre-
neurs’ personal values and beliefs influence the way they lead their companies and are apparent 
in every decision they make, every policy they write, and every action they take. Additionally, 
the entrepreneurs’ values set the tone for the culture that will guide the ethical actions of every 
employee they bring into their business. Entrepreneurs who succeed in the long term have a solid 
base of personal values and beliefs that they articulate to their employees, put into practice in 
ways that others can observe, and are demonstrated throughout the culture of the organization. 
Values-based leaders do more than merely follow rules and regulations; their consciences dictate 
that they do what is right.
For many entrepreneurs, the ability to determine the values and ethics that will shape how 
business will be conducted is a major motivation to launching a venture. For example, Blake 
Jones spent several years working as an engineer in Nepal and Egypt. Jones found the caste sys-
tem in Nepal and the rigid social structure of Egypt appalling. When he returned to the United 
States, Jones joined with two partners to form a company, Namasté Solar, built on their shared 
value of the importance of full participation of all employees in the governance of the business. 
To bring these values to life, Jones and his partners structured Namasté Solar as an employee 
owned cooperative. The company Web site describes its business model as follows: “We choose 
co-ownership over hierarchy, democratic decision-making over centralized leadership, sustain-
able growth over aggressive expansion, and collaboration over competition.”1 Namasté Solar 
designs and installs residential and commercial solar electric systems in Colorado. Seventy
percent of the employees are owners of the company, with each owning one share valued 
at $5,000. All employee owners have an equal vote in important issues facing the company. 
“A 22-year-old recent college grad who is an apprentice installing solar panels on rooftops has 
the same vote as I have,” says Jones. “I regularly don’t get my way.”2
The values and morals that entrepreneurs draw on to guide their ethical behaviors come 
from a variety of sources, including their family upbringing, their faith traditions, mentors who
have shaped their lives, and the communities they grew up in. Bringing their personal values into 
their decision making and actions in their businesses helps ensure that entrepreneurs will act 
with integrity. Acting with integrity means that entrepreneurs do what is right no matter what the 
circumstances.
In some cases, ethical dilemmas are apparent. Entrepreneurs must be keenly aware of the 
ethical entrapments awaiting them and know that society will hold them accountable for their 
actions. More often, however, ethical issues are less obvious, cloaked in the garb of mundane
decisions and everyday routine. Because they can easily catch entrepreneurs off guard and 
unprepared, these ethical “sleepers” are most likely to ensnare business owners, soiling their 
reputations and those of their companies. Repeated enough times, these unethical acts can
become habits that shape the moral character of the entrepreneur. To make proper ethical choices, 
entrepreneurs must first be aware that a situation with ethical implications exists.
Complicating the issue even more is that, in some ethical dilemmas, no clear-cut right or 
wrong answers exist. There is no direct conflict between good and evil, right and wrong, or 
truth and falsehood. Instead, there is only the issue of conflicting interests among a company’s 
stakeholders, the various groups and individuals who affect and are affected by a business. These 
conflicts force entrepreneurs to identify their stakeholders and to consider the ways in which
entrepreneurs will deal with them (see Figure 2.1). For instance, when the founders of a local 
coffee shop make business decisions, they must consider the impact of those decisions on many 
stakeholders, including the team of employees who work there, the farmers and companies that 
supply the business with raw materials, the union that represents employees in collective bargain-
ing, the government agencies that regulate a multitude of activities, the banks that provide the 
business with financing, the founding partners and other external investors who helped fund the 
start-up, the general public the business serves, the community in which the company operates,
the customers who buy the company’s products, and their families. When making decisions, 
stakeholders
the various groups and 
individuals who affect and 
are affected by a business.

CHAPTER 2 • ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: DOING THE RIGHT THING
61
entrepreneurs often must balance the needs and demands of a company’s stakeholders, knowing 
that whatever the final decision is, not all groups will be satisfied.
Ethical leaders approach their organizational responsibilities with added dimensions of 
thought and action. They link ethical behaviors to organizational outcomes and incorporate social 
responsibility into daily decisions. They establish ethical behavior and concern for the environ-
ment as an integral part of organizational training and eventually as part of company culture. 
How does a commitment to “doing the right thing” apply to employees, customers, and other 
stakeholders, and how does it affect an entrepreneur’s daily decision making? Large technology 
companies such as Apple, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, and Verizon have been facing an
ethical dilemma as they attempt to comply with the National Security Administration’s request 
for information. The NSA operates a program known as Prism, which gathers telephone and 
Internet data to capture information about foreign nationals living in America. The NSA gets this 
information from technology companies that provide Internet and telephone services to consum-
ers and businesses. Technology companies gain significant revenue from the data they gather 
from their users. For example, although Google offers many of its products such as Gmail and 
the Google search engine free to most users, these products generate significant revenue from the 
information Google amasses from its users’ Internet searches and emails. Google sells the data to
advertisers, which then use it to target ads to specific consumers. Although their customers gener-
ally are aware that data mining is commonly a part of having access to technologies at no cost, 
there is an implied understanding that this data will be protected beyond Google’s internal use. 
However, Google and other large technology companies have a duty to comply with the federal 
government’s request for information tied to national security concerns and have turned over large 
amounts of customer data to the NSA.3 As evidenced by this example, balancing the demands of 
various stakeholders to make ethical decisions is no easy task.
Business operates as an institution in our often complex and ever-evolving society. As such,
every entrepreneur is expected to behave in ways that are compatible with the value system of 
society. It is society that imposes the rules of conduct for all business owners in the form of 
ethical standards of behavior and responsibilities to act in ways that benefit the long-term interest 
of all. Society expects business owners to strive to earn a profit on their investment. Ethics and
social responsibility simply set behavioral boundaries for decision makers. Ethics is a branch 
of philosophy that studies and creates theories about the basic nature of right and wrong, duty, 
obligation, and virtue. Social responsibility involves how an organization responds to the needs 
of the many elements in society, including shareholders, lenders, employees, consumers, govern-
mental agencies, and the environment. Because business is allowed to operate in society, it has an 
obligation to behave in ways that benefit all of society.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
An Ethical Perspective
Business ethics consists of the fundamental moral values and behavioral standards that form the 
foundation for the people of an organization as they make decisions and interact with stakehold-
ers. Business ethics is a sensitive and highly complex issue, but it is not a new one. In 560 BC, 
the Greek philosopher Chilon claimed that a merchant does better to take a loss than to make
a dishonest profit.4 Maintaining an ethical perspective is essential to creating and protecting a 
company’s reputation, but it is no easy task. Ethical dilemmas lurk in the decisions—even the 
most mundane ones—that entrepreneurs make every day. Succumbing to unethical temptations 
ultimately can destroy a company’s reputation, one of the most precious and most fragile posses-
sions of any business.
Building a reputation for ethical behavior typically takes a long time; unfortunately, destroy-
ing that reputation requires practically no time at all, and the effects linger for some time. One 
top manager compares a bad reputation to a hangover: “It takes a while to get rid of, and it makes 
everything else hurt.”5 Many businesses flounder or even fail after their owners or managers are 
caught acting unethically.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Brian Whitfield, Edwin Todd, and Marsha Whitfield:
Sommet Group Brian Whitfield and his father-in-law Edwin Todd founded Sommet 
Group to provide business services, including payroll, human resources, employee benefits, and
staffing, to small- and medium-sized companies. Outsourcing these functions allowed their clients
to focus on growing their business. Marsha Whitfield, Brian’s wife and Edwin Todd’s daughter, 
served as Vice President of Payroll for the company. To help build brand awareness, the Sommet
Group entered into a multi-year naming rights agreement in 2007 with the Nashville Predators of 
the National Hockey League. The company was seeking to become a nationally known provider
of outsourced business services. The home arena for the Predators became known as the Sommet 
Center. However, soon the empire being built by the family-owned business began to unravel. In 
2009, just two years after signing the agreement, the Nashville Predators sued the Sommet Group 
to revoke the naming rights, alleging nonpayment of the agreed-upon naming rights fees. In July 
2010 the FBI raided Sommet Group’s headquarters, looking for evidence of fraud. In 2011 federal 
agents also raided the home of Brian and Marsha Whitfield seeking additional evidence. That 
same year Marsha filed for divorce. On March 1, 2012, the Whitfields and Todd were indicted in
federal court on 15 criminal counts, including wire fraud, conspiracy, theft from an ERISA plan,
and money laundering charges. The Whitfields allegedly stole more than $650,000 from an
employee pension plan to help pay for the arena naming rights obligations, to buy a houseboat, 
and to build a pool at their home. The indictment also alleged that the Whitfields failed to report 
almost $80 million of gross wages paid on behalf of Sommet clients, leading to an underpayment 
of more than $20 million in income taxes. In July 2013, two former executives of Sommet reached
a plea deal with federal prosecutors. Edwin Todd agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspir-
acy. Marsha Whitfield agreed to testify against her former husband Brian Whitfield and pleaded 
guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud.6 ■
Three Levels of Ethical Standards
As displayed in Figure 2.2, there are three levels of ethical standards:
1. The law, which defines for society as a whole those actions that are permissible and those 
that are not. The law is the narrowest level of ethical standards. The law merely establishes 
the minimum standard of behavior. Actions that are legal, however, may not be ethical. 
Simply obeying the law is insufficient as a guide for ethical behavior; ethical behavior 
requires more. Few ethical issues are so simple and one dimensional that the law can serve 
as the acid test for making a decision.
2. Organizational policies and procedures, which serve as specific guidelines for people as 
they make daily decisions. Policies and procedures include a broader definition of ethical 
standards that go beyond what is defined by the law. Many colleges and universities have
created honor codes, and companies rely on policies covering everything from sexual 
harassment and gift giving to hiring and whistle blowing.

CHAPTER 2 • ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: DOING THE RIGHT THING
63
3. The moral stance that employees take when they encounter a situation that is not governed 
by levels 1 and 2. It is the broadest and most fundamental definition of ethical standards. 
The values people learn early in life at home, from their religious upbringing, in the 
communities they were raised in, in school, and at work are key ingredients at this level.
Morality is what shapes a person’s character. A strong determinant of moral behavior is 
training. As Aristotle said thousands of years ago, you get a good adult by teaching a child
to do the right thing. A company’s culture can serve either to support or undermine its 
employees’ concepts of what constitutes ethical behavior.
Ethics is something that every businessperson faces daily; most decisions involve some 
degree of ethical judgment. Over the course of a career, entrepreneurs can be confident that they
will face some tough ethical choices. However, that is not necessarily bad! Situations such as
these give entrepreneurs the opportunity to flex their ethical muscles and do what is right. Entre-
preneurs set the ethical tone for their companies. The ethical stance employees take when faced 
with difficult decisions often reflects the values that entrepreneurs have used to intentionally 
shape the culture within their businesses.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Joey Prusak, Dairy Queen manager Joey Prusak was 
working at the Dairy Queen franchise where he had been employed for the previous five 
years. A blind man, who was a regular customer, was standing at the counter paying his bill. While
the customer was getting money out of his wallet, he unknowingly dropped a twenty-dollar bill. 
A woman standing behind him in line quickly picked up the twenty-dollar bill and put it in her purse.
When the woman stepped up to the counter to be served, Prusak asked her to return the money to 
the man who had dropped it. She refused, claiming it was her money that she had dropped. Prusak
refused to serve her, saying that he would not serve her if she was going to be so “disrespectful” to 
another customer. The woman became belligerent and stormed out of the store. Prusak served the 
remaining customers in line, apologizing to each one for the incident. Prusak then went over to the 
blind man, pulled out a twenty-dollar bill, and handed him the money, telling him that he had 
dropped it on the floor when he was paying for his food. A customer who witnessed the entire 
incident wrote a comment card describing what had happened. The owner of the franchise put the
comment card on a bulletin board for all of the employees to see. One of the employees took a
picture of the card and posted it on Facebook. The story then went viral. Billionaire Warren Buffet,
whose company Berkshire Hathaway owns American Dairy Queen Corporation, heard the story and
invited Prusak to be his special guest at the annual shareholder meeting of Berkshire Hathaway.7 ■

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Moral Management
Although companies may set ethical standards and offer guidelines for employees, the ultimate 
decision on whether to abide by ethical principles rests with the individual. In other words, 
companies really are not ethical or unethical; individuals are. Managers, however, can greatly 
influence individual behavior within the company. That influence must start at the top of the 
organization. The entrepreneur who practices ethical behavior establishes the moral tone for 
the entire organization. Table 2.1 summarizes the characteristics of the three ethical styles of 
management: immoral, amoral, and moral management.
IMMORAL MANAGEMENT Immoral managers are motivated by selfish reasons such as their 
own gains or those of the company. The driving force behind immoral management is greed: 
achieving personal or organizational success at any cost. Immoral management is the polar 
opposite of ethical management; immoral managers do what they can to circumvent laws and 
moral standards and are not concerned about the impact their actions have on others.
AMORAL MANAGEMENT The principal goal of amoral managers is to earn a profit, but their 
actions differ from those of immoral managers in one key way: They do not purposely violate
laws or ethical standards. Instead, amoral managers neglect to consider the impact their decisions 
have on others; they use free-rein decision making without reference to ethical standards. Amoral 
management is not an option for socially responsible businesses.
MORAL MANAGEMENT Moral managers also strive for success but only within the boundaries of 
legal and ethical standards. Moral managers are not willing to sacrifice their values and violate 
TABLE 2.1 Approaches to Business Ethics
Organizational
Characteristics
Immoral Management
Amoral Management
Moral Management
Ethical norms
Management decisions, actions, 
and behavior imply a positive and 
active opposition to what is moral
(ethical).
Decisions are discordant with 
accepted ethical principles.
An active negation of what is
moral is implicit.
Management is neither moral nor 
immoral; decisions are not based 
on moral judgments.
Management activity is not related 
to any moral code.
A lack of ethical perception and 
moral awareness may be implicit.
Management activity conforms 
to a standard of ethical, or right, 
behavior.
Management activity conforms to 
accepted professional standards of 
conduct.
Ethical leadership is commonplace.
Motives
Selfish. Management cares only 
about its or its company’s gains.
Well-intentioned but selfish in the
sense that impact on others is not 
considered.
Good. Management wants 
to succeed but only within 
the confines of sound ethical 
precepts such as fairness, justice, 
and due process.
Goals
Profitability and organizational 
success at any price.
Profitability. Other goals are not 
considered.
Profitability within the confines 
of legal obedience and ethical 
standards.
Orientation 
toward law
Legal standards are barriers that 
management must overcome to 
accomplish what it wants.
Law is the ethical guide, preferably 
the letter of the law. The central 
question is, what we can do legally?
Obedience toward letter and spirit 
of the law. Law is a minimal ethical
behavior. Prefer to operate well 
above what law mandates.
Strategy
Exploit opportunities for corporate 
gain. Cut corners when it appears 
useful.
Give managers free rein. Personal 
ethics may apply but only if 
managers choose. Respond to 
legal mandates if caught and 
required to do so.
Live by sound ethical standards.
Assume leadership position when 
ethical dilemmas arise. Enlightened 
self-interest.

ethical standards just to make a profit. Managers who operate with this philosophy see the law as
a minimum standard for ethical behavior.
The Benefits of Moral Management
One of the most common misconceptions about business is that there is a contradiction between
earning a profit and maintaining high ethical standards. In reality, companies have learned that 
these two goals are consistent with one another. Elizabeth Riley, program manager of Impact 
Engine, a Chicago-based business accelerator that supports for-profit start-ups with strong social 
missions, says, “Much too often, business leaders are faced with an unnecessary choice between 
profits and making the world a better place. This is a false construct that has been perpetuated for 
far too long—profit and purpose should not be mutually exclusive.”8 Many entrepreneurs launch 
businesses with the idea of making a difference in society. They quickly learn that to “do good,” 
their companies must first “do well.” Bridget Hilton, founder of Jack’s Soap, a for-profit com-
pany that addresses the problem of child mortality due to hygiene by donating one bar of soap to 
a child in need for every bar of soap sold, says, “Cynics believe there’s no way to do good while 
reaping financial rewards. We beg to differ.”9
According to a survey by the public relations firm Edelman, 83 percent of U.S. consumers 
say transparent and honest practices and operating as a business that one can trust are the most 
important factors in a company’s reputation.10 The Edelman survey also reports that people in the 
United States (and globally) trust small businesses more than big businesses.11
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Patrick Woodyard and 
Nick Meyer: Nisolo Patrick Woodyard began developing 
the for-profit social venture he cofounded in 2011, called Nisolo, 
when he was working in a microfinance project in Peru. Woodyard
observed talented craftsmen and artisans who were struggling 
to find a market for their products. Woodyard launched Nisolo
to help Peruvian shoemakers expand the market for their hand-
made shoes. Nisolo sells high quality, fashionable men’s and
women’s shoes handmade by artisans in Peru through e-commerce 
and out of its showroom in Nashville, Tennessee. Nisolo sells shoes 
that are both fashionable and help support the shoemakers living 
in impoverished regions. With each purchase, customers receive a
business card from the shoemaker who makes their shoes. Nisolo’s
goal is to help Peruvian shoemakers receive a fair price and have
steady sales for their shoes. The shoes are high quality and retail 
for an average price of $120 per pair. Nisolo pays the shoemakers
an average of $30 per pair, which is enough to pull them out of 
poverty and provide a sustainable living for their families. “It’s
about giving them jobs and empowering them,” says cofounder 
Nick Meyer. Nisolo seeks to earn a profit while at the same time helping to provide economic 
empowerment for the artisans who supply its handmade shoes by offering them a fair price for 
their products.12 ■
Although behaving ethically has value in itself, there are many other benefits to companies 
that adhere to high ethical standards. First, companies avoid the damaging fallout from unethical 
behavior on their reputations. Unethical businesses usually gain only short-term advantages; over 
the long run, unethical decisions don’t pay. It’s simply not good business.
Second, a solid ethical framework guides managers as they cope with an increasingly com-
plex network of influence from external stakeholders. Dealing with stakeholders is much easier 
if a company has a solid ethical foundation on which to build.
Third, businesses with solid reputations as ethical companies find it easier to attract and 
retain quality workers. Max Lubarsky gets paid to volunteer for a variety of projects in Wash-
ington, D.C., including cleaning up the bird exhibit at the National Zoo, participating in Habitat

monuments. Lubarsky works for the Carlyle Group, which offers employees two paid days off

back to the community,” says Lubarsky. Lubarsky has a strong loyalty to Carlyle Group, as he 
wants to work for a company where he can make a difference within both his profession and his
community.13
Fourth, ethical behavior has a positive impact on a company’s bottom line. Research on 
the relationship between corporate ethics and financial performance suggests that companies 
that outperform their competitors ethically also outperform them financially due to the strong
employee commitment that an ethical culture creates.14 However, financial rewards should never 
become the motivating force behind acting ethically. Entrepreneurs must strive to do the right 
thing simply because it is the right thing to do!
Finally, a company’s ethical philosophy has an impact on its ability to provide value for its 
customers. The “ethics factor” is difficult to quantify, yet it is something that customers consider 
when deciding where to shop and which company’s products to buy. “Do I want people buying 
Timberland boots as a result of the firm’s volunteer efforts?” asks CEO Jeffrey Swartz. “You 
bet.”15 Timberland’s commitment to “doing good” in addition to “doing well” is expressed in its 
slogan, “Boots, Brand, Belief.” Like other social entrepreneurs, Swartz’s goal is to manage the 
company successfully so that he can use its resources to combat social problems.
Entrepreneurs must recognize that ethical behavior is an investment in the company’s future
rather than merely a cost of doing business. Table 2.2 shows the results of a comprehensive study
that was conducted by the American Management Association of global human resources direc-
tors who were asked about the reasons for their companies’ engaging in ethical behavior and the 
factors that drive business ethics today.
Establishing an Ethical Framework
To cope successfully with the many ethical decisions they face, entrepreneurs must develop a 
workable ethical framework to guide themselves and the organization. Although many frame-
works exist, the following five-step process works quite well:
Step 1. Identify the personal moral and ethical principles that shape all business 
decisions. Entrepreneurs build the foundation for making ethical decisions by 
understanding how their personal values come to life in business situations. This 
starts with an inventory of the important principles that define one’s personal 
values. The entrepreneur then determines how each of these principles affects 
each of the major stakeholders of the business. Many entrepreneurs integrate 
this proactive approach to ethical decision making into their business plans to
ensure the integrity of their business actions as they launch and grow their 
business ventures.

Step 2. Recognize the ethical dimensions involved in the dilemma or decision. Before 
entrepreneurs can make informed ethical decisions, they must recognize that an 
ethical situation exists. Only then is it possible to define the specific ethical issues 
involved. Too often, business owners fail to take into account the ethical impact of 
a particular course of action until it is too late. To avoid ethical quagmires, entre-
preneurs must consider the ethical forces at work in a situation—honesty, fairness, 
respect for the community, concern for the environment, trust, and others—to 
have a complete view of the decision.
Step 3. Identify the key stakeholders involved and determine how the decision will 
affect them. Every business influences and is influenced by a multitude of 
stakeholders. Frequently, the demands of these stakeholders conflict with one
another, putting a business in the position of having to choose which groups to
satisfy and which to alienate. Before making a decision, 
managers must sort out the conflicting interests of the 
various stakeholders by determining which ones have 
important stakes in the situation. Although this analysis
may not resolve the conflict, it will prevent the company 
from inadvertently causing harm to people it may have 
failed to consider. More companies are measuring their 
performance using a triple bottom line (3BL) that, in ad-
dition to the traditional measure of profitability, includes 
the commitment to ethics and social responsibility and the
impact on the environment (“profit, people, and planet”).

Step 4. Generate alternative choices and distinguish between ethical and unethical 
responses. When entrepreneurs are generating alternative courses of action and 
evaluating the consequences of each one, they can use the questions in Table 2.3
to guide them. Asking and answering questions such as these ensure that everyone 
involved is aware of the ethical dimensions of the issue.

Step 5. Choose the “best” ethical response and implement it. At this point, there likely 
will be several ethical choices from which managers can pick. Comparing these 
choices to the “ideal” ethical outcome may help managers make the final decision. 
The final choice must be consistent with the company’s goals, culture, and value 
system as well as those of the individual decision makers.
Why Ethical Lapses Occur
Although most small business owners run their companies ethically, business scandals involv-
ing Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other high-profile companies have sullied the reputations of 
businesses of all sizes. The best way for business owners to combat these negative public percep-
tions is to run their business ethically. When faced with an ethical dilemma, however, not every 
entrepreneur or employee will make the right decision. According to KPMG’s Integrity Survey, 
73 percent of workers say they have observed ethical lapses in their companies within the last year, 
and 56 percent say the misconduct they observed would cause “a significant loss of public trust if 
discovered.”17 Normally decent people who believe in moral values commit many unethical acts. 
Figure 2.3 shows the results of the KPMG Integrity Survey that identifies the primary causes of 
misconduct in businesses. Let’s explore some of the causes if ethical lapses in more detail.
An Unethical Employee
Ethical decisions are individual decisions, and some people are corrupt. Try as they might to 
avoid them, small businesses occasionally find that they have hired a “bad apple.” Eliminating
unethical behavior requires eliminating these bad apples.
An Unethical Organizational Culture
In some cases, a company’s culture has been poisoned with an unethical overtone; in other words, 
the problem is not the “bad apple” but the “bad barrel.” Pressure to prosper produces an environment 
that creates conditions that reward unethical behavior, and employees act accordingly. Studies show 
that companies with strong ethical cultures experience fewer ethical violations than those with weak 
ethical cultures.18 In fact, an ethical culture positively influences the behaviors of employees inde-
pendently of the degree to which there is a match between employee and organizational values.19

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Moral Blindness
Sometimes, fundamentally ethical people commit unethical blunders because they are blind to 
the implications of their conduct. Moral blindness may be the result of failing to realize that an 
ethical dilemma exists, or it may arise from a variety of mental defense mechanisms. One of the 
most common mechanisms is rationalization:
“Everybody does it.”
“If they were in my place, they’d do it too.”
“Being ethical is a luxury I cannot afford right now.”
“The impact of my decision/action on (whomever or whatever) is not my concern.”
“I don’t get paid to be ethical; I get paid to produce results.”
Conducting ethics training and creating a culture that encourages employees to consider the 
ethical impact of their decisions reduces the likelihood of moral blindness. Instilling a sense of 
individual responsibility and encouraging people at all levels of an organization to speak up when 
they see questionable actions create a company-wide ethical conscience. However, employees 
are not the only ones who need guidance when facing ethical decisions. Entrepreneurs them-
selves should also seek out advice and counsel when it comes to ethics. One reason entrepreneurs 
should establish advisory boards is to serve as a sounding board to help ensure that they under-
stand the moral and ethical dimensions of major decisions.
Competitive Pressures
If competition is so intense that a company’s survival is threatened, managers may begin to view 
what were once unacceptable options as acceptable. Managers and employees are under such 
pressure to produce that they may sacrifice their ethical standards to reduce the fear of failure or 
the fear of losing their jobs. Without a positive organizational culture that stresses ethical behav-
ior regardless of the consequences, employees respond to feelings of pressure and compromise 
their personal ethical standards to ensure that the job gets done.
Opportunity Pressures
When the opportunity to “get ahead” by taking some unethical action presents itself, some people
cannot resist the temptation. The greater the reward or the smaller the penalty for unethical acts, 
the greater is the probability that such behavior will occur. If managers, for example, condone 
or even encourage unethical behavior, they can be sure it will occur. Those who succumb to 
opportunity pressures often make one of two mistakes: They overestimate the cost of doing the 
right thing, or they underestimate the cost of doing the wrong thing. Either error can lead to disaster.
Globalization of Business
The globalization of business has intertwined what once were
distinct cultures. This cultural cross-pollination has brought about 
many positive aspects, but it has created problems as well. Com-
panies have discovered no single standard of ethical behavior ap-
plies to all business decisions in the international arena. Practices
that are illegal in one country may be perfectly acceptable, even 
expected, in another. Actions that would send a businessperson to
jail in Western nations are common ways of working around the 
system in others.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Rob Grabow: Intrepid 
Sportswear Rob Grabow has always loved playing 
basketball. His experience wearing poor quality, over-priced uni-

trepid Sportswear, which is based in Seattle, Washington, focuses 
on efficiency by shipping product directly from the manufacturer

to the customer. The savings from eliminating buyers in international markets, wholesalers, and 
U.S.-based sales representatives is passed along to their customers. Intrepid customers save as 
much as 50 percent on uniforms compared to other suppliers. In addition to paying overseas 
workers above-market wages, Intrepid also gives 5 to 10 percent of its net profits back to these 
workers. Grabow says he gives back to his employees because it is ethical to share success with 
those who helped create it. However, the practice also creates positive outcomes for his business. 
Grabow finds that Intrepid Sportswear’s profit sharing has improved employee retention and
loyalty. His team is more willing to go above and beyond for the company. Grabow believes doing
the right thing and sound business practices are not mutually exclusive. Intrepid sells to teams in 
all 50 states and to teams in eight countries in Europe. More than 6,400 teams have bought uni-
forms from Intrepid since Grabow started the business in his dorm room in 2002.20 ■
Table 2.4 provides a summary of important ethics research concerning the characteristics 
that are most important to establishing an ethical culture.
Establishing and Maintaining Ethical Standards
Establishing Ethical Standards
A study by the Southern Institute for Business and Professional Ethics found that small compa-
nies are less likely than large ones to have ethics programs.21 Although they may not have formal 
ethics programs, entrepreneurs can encourage employees to become familiar with the following 
ethical tests for judging behavior:
● The utilitarian principle. Choose the option that offers the greatest good for the greatest 
number of people.
● Kant’s categorical imperative. Act in such a way that the action taken under the 
circumstances could be a universal law or rule of behavior.
● The professional ethic. Take only those actions that a disinterested panel of professional 
colleagues would view as proper.
● The Golden Rule. Treat other people the way you would like them to treat you.
● The television test. Would you and your colleagues feel comfortable explaining your 
actions to a national television audience?
● The family test. Would you be comfortable explaining to your children, your spouse, 
and your parents why you took this action?22
Although these tests do not offer universal solutions to ethical dilemmas, they do help employees 
identify the moral implications of the decisions they face. People must be able to understand the 
ethical impact of their actions before they can make responsible decisions. Table 2.5 describes
ten ethical principles that differentiate between right and wrong, thereby offering a guideline for 
ethical behavior.
TABLE 2.4 Ethics Research Reveals Features of Ethical Cultures
1. Leaders support and model ethical behavior.
2. Consistent communications come from all company leaders.
3. Ethics is integrated into the organization’s goals, business processes, and strategies.
4. Ethics is part of the performance management system.
5. Ethics is part of the company’s selection criteria and selection process.

each member of the team to talk about the one thing he or she

business practice. ■
TABLE 2.5 Ten Ethical Principles to Guide Behavior
The study of history, philosophy, and religion reveals a strong consensus about certain universal and timeless values that are central to
leading an ethical life.
1. Honesty. Be truthful, sincere, forthright, straightforward, frank, and candid; do not cheat, lie, steal, deceive, or act deviously.
2. Integrity. Be principled, honorable, upright, and courageous and act on convictions; do not be two-faced or unscrupulous or 
adopt an ends-justifies-the-means philosophy that ignores principle.
3. Promise-keeping. Be worthy of trust, keep promises, fulfill commitments, and abide by the spirit as well as the letter of an 
agreement; do not interpret agreements in a technical or legalistic manner to rationalize noncompliance or to create excuses for 
breaking commitments.
4. Fidelity. Be faithful and loyal to family, friends, employers, and country; do not use or disclose information earned in 
confidence; in a professional context, safeguard the ability to make independent professional judgments by scrupulously 
avoiding undue influences and conflicts of interest.
5. Fairness. Be fair and open-minded, be willing to admit error and, when appropriate, change positions and beliefs; demonstrate a 
commitment to justice, the equal treatment of individuals, and tolerance for diversity; do not overreach or take undue advantage
of another’s mistakes or adversities.
6. Caring for others. Be caring, kind, and compassionate; share, be giving, and serve others; help those in need and avoid 
harming others.
7. Respect for others. Demonstrate respect for human dignity, privacy, and the right to self-determination for all people; be
courteous, prompt, and decent; provide others with the information they need to make informed decisions about their own lives;
do not patronize, embarrass, or demean.
8. Responsible citizenship. Obey just laws [if a law is unjust, openly protest it]; exercise all democratic rights and privileges 
responsibly by participation [voting and expressing informed views], social consciousness, and public service; when in a position
of leadership or authority, openly respect and honor democratic processes of decision making, avoid secrecy or concealment of 
information, and ensure others have the information needed to make intelligent choices and exercise their rights.
9. Pursuit of excellence. Pursue excellence in all matters; in meeting personal and professional responsibilities, be diligent, 
reliable, industrious, and committed; perform all tasks to the best of your ability, develop and maintain a high degree of 
competence, and be well informed and well prepared; do not be content with mediocrity, but do not seek to win “at any cost.”
10. Accountability. Be accountable; accept responsibility for decisions, for the foreseeable consequences of actions and inactions, 
and for setting an example for others. Parents, teachers, employers, many professionals, and public officials have a special
obligation to lead by example and to safeguard and advance the integrity and reputation of their families, companies, professions, 
and the government; avoid even the appearance of impropriety and take whatever actions are necessary to correct or prevent 
inappropriate conduct by others.

Maintaining Ethical Standards
Establishing ethical standards is only the first step in an ethics-enhancing program; implementing 
and maintaining those standards is the real challenge facing management. What can entrepre-
neurs do to integrate ethical principles into their companies? To create an environment that en-
courages ethical behavior, entrepreneurs must make building an intentional culture that is based 
on a strong ethical foundation a core responsibility as leaders of their businesses.
SET THE TONE “The character of the leader casts a long shadow over the organization and can 
determine the character of the organization itself,” says one business executive.23 Entrepreneurs 
must set an impeccable ethical example at all times. Remember that ethics starts at the top. If 
entrepreneurs and their managers talk about the importance of ethics and then act in an unethical 
manner, they send mixed signals to employees. Workers believe the actions of those in charge 
more than their words. What you do, how you do it, and what you say set the tone for your 
employees. The values you profess must be aligned with the behaviors you demonstrate.
CREATE A COMPANY CREDO A company credo defines the values underlying the entire company 
and its ethical responsibilities to its stakeholders. It offers general guidance in ethical issues. The 
most effective credos capture the elusive essence of a company—what it stands for and why it’s 
important—and they can be a key ingredient in a company’s competitive edge. A company credo is
especially important for a small company, where the entrepreneur’s values become the values driving 
the business. A credo is an excellent way to transform those values into guidelines for employees’ 
ethical behavior. For example, Trustworth, a residential provider of elderly care operating in 
England, developed the following credo: “Our residents are a mirror of ourselves should we reach 
old age. They have been entrusted to our care and we have accepted that trust. We resolve to give
them the patience, loving care and understanding we would like to receive for ourselves.”24
ESTABLISH HIGH STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR It is essential to emphasize to everyone in the 
organization the importance of ethics. All employees must understand that ethics is not negotiable.
t
The role that an entrepreneur plays in establishing high ethical standards is critical; no one 
has more influence over the ethical character of a company than its founder. One experienced 
entrepreneur offers this advice to business owners: “Stick to your principles. Hire people who 
want to live by them, teach them thoroughly, and insist on total commitment.”25
INVOLVE EMPLOYEES IN ESTABLISHING ETHICAL STANDARDS Encourage employees to offer 
feedback on how to establish standards. Involving employees improves the quality of a company’s 
ethical standards and increases the likelihood of employee compliance.
CREATE A CULTURE THAT EMPHASIZES TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION A thriving ethical 
environment requires two-way communication. Employees must have the opportunity to report 
any ethical violations they observe. A reliable, confidential reporting system is essential to a 
whistle-blowing program, in which employees anonymously report breaches of ethical behavior 
through proper channels.
ELIMINATE “UNDISCUSSABLES.” One of the most important things entrepreneurs can do to 
promote ethical behavior is to instill the belief that it is acceptable for employees to question what 
happens above them. Doing away with undiscussables makes issues transparent and promotes 
trust both inside and outside the company.26
DEVELOP A CODE OF ETHICS A code of ethics is a written statement of the standards of behavior 
and ethical principles a company expects from its employees. A code of ethics spells out what 
kind of behavior is expected (and what kind will not be tolerated) and offers everyone in the 
company concrete guidelines for dealing with ethics every day on the job. Although creating a
code of ethics does not guarantee 100 percent compliance with ethical standards, it does tend to 
foster an ethical atmosphere in a company. Workers who will be directly affected by the code 
should have a hand in developing it.
ENFORCE THE CODE OF ETHICS THROUGH POLICIES Set appropriate policies for your organization. 
Communicate them on a regular basis and adhere to them yourself so that others can see. Show 
zero tolerance for ethical violations and realize that the adage “Don’t do as I do; do as I say”

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
does not work. Without a demonstration of real consequences and personal accountability from
t
the CEO, organizational policies are meaningless. Managers must take action whenever they 
discover ethical violations. If employees learn that ethical breaches go unpunished, the code of 
ethics becomes meaningless. Enforcement of the code of ethics demonstrates to everyone that 
you believe ethical behavior is mandatory.
RECRUIT AND PROMOTE ETHICAL EMPLOYEES Ultimately, the decision in any ethical situation
belongs to the individual. Hiring people with strong moral principles and values is the best insurance 
against ethical violations. To make ethical decisions, people must have (1) ethical commitment—
the personal resolve to act ethically and do the right thing; (2) ethical consciousness—the ability to 
perceive the ethical implications of a situation; and (3) ethical competency—the ability to engage 
in sound moral reasoning and develop practical problem-solving strategies.27 Find colleges 
and universities that incorporate business ethics into courses and make them prime recruiting 
sources. Tina Byles Williams, owner of FIS Group, an investment advising and management firm, 
understands how important it is to hire honest employees with a strong sense of ethics. Although 
Williams knows that there is no foolproof hiring method, she has redesigned her company’s 
selection process with an emphasis on screening for integrity.28
CONDUCT ETHICS TRAINING Instilling ethics in an organization’s culture requires more than 
creating a code of ethics and enforcing it. Managers must show employees that the organization 
truly is committed to practicing ethical behavior. One of the most effective ways to display that 
commitment is through ethical training designed to raise employees’ consciousness of potential 
ethical dilemmas. Ethics training programs not only raise employees’ awareness of ethical
issues but also communicate to employees the core of the company’s value system. Rob Kaplan, 
professor of management practice at Harvard University, recommends that employees be trained 
to follow a simple yet powerful three-step process when facing an ethical situation:
1. Slow down.
2. Seek advice and elevate the issue.
3. Don’t get bullied into making a quick decision you might later regret.29
REWARD ETHICAL CONDUCT The reward system is a large window into the values of an 
organization. If you reward a behavior, people have a tendency to repeat the behavior.
SEPARATE RELATED JOB DUTIES This is a basic organizational concept. Not allowing the 
employee who writes checks to reconcile the company bank statement is one example.
PERFORM PERIODIC ETHICAL AUDITS One of the best ways to evaluate the effectiveness of an 
ethics system is to perform periodic audits. These reviews send a signal to employees that ethics 
is not just a passing fad.
Social Entrepreneurship
Whereas traditional entrepreneurs seek opportunities to create market value, there is a growing 
trend to use entrepreneurship to pursue opportunities to create social value. These social entre-
preneurs, people who start businesses so that they can create innovative solutions to society’s
most vexing problems, see themselves as change agents for society. Social entrepreneurs are 
finding the resources to tackle challenging problems confronting the global economy, including 
pollution, habitat destruction, human rights, AIDS, hunger, poverty, and others. Social entrepre-
neurship can be characterized by the following:
1. Social entrepreneurs seek solutions for social problems that are met by neither the market 
nor government.
2. Creating social benefit rather than commercial success motivates social entrepreneurs.
3. Social entrepreneurs tackle social problems by taking full advantage of natural market 
forces.30

Nonprofits are facing severe funding challenges. Although the 
number of social ventures is increasing, funding from grants and 
donations has declined. A recent survey found that 54 percent of 
nonprofits were not able to generate enough funding to meet
demand for their services. As a result, 39 percent of nonprofits
surveyed plan to change the main way they raise funding. To meet
this challenge, several nonprofits have turned to a creative way to 
fund their missions. Rather than rely on grants and donations, a 
growing number are using franchise businesses to generate new
revenue streams to fund their causes.
Sandwich Shop Helps Build Housing
Affordable Homes of South Texas develops affordable housing
for low-income families. In the past, the agency relied on fed-
eral grants as its main source of funding. However, this source of
funding has declined steadily over the past several years due to
government budget cuts while demand for its services had contin-
ued to climb. Bobby Calvillo, the executive director of Affordable 
Homes of South Texas, had an inspiration when he noticed lines 
of people waiting for service in a sandwich shop nearby. Calvillo
wondered if Affordable Homes could open its own sandwich shop 
to help provide badly needed funding for its clients. After getting 
approval from his board, Calvillo began the process of buying a 
Blimpie’s sandwich franchise. Affordable Homes could not directly
own a franchise business because nonprofits are not allowed to
own such investments. Affordable Homes set up an investment
corporation as a parent entity and, under it, formed a limited 
liability company that would own the franchise business. Calvillo 
projects that the franchise will be able to fund the construction of 
several homes once it is fully operational.
Clients of Training Center Bake Pizzas 
to Generate Revenue
Dale Rogers Training Center trains and employs more than 
1,100 people with disabilities in Oklahoma City each year. Due
to declining private funding, the nonprofit partnered with Papa 
Murphy’s Pizza to open a franchise operation to provide additional 
funding and offer a place for at least 15 of its clients to work. Dale 
Rogers Training Center is not new to using social enterprises to
support its operating budget. The nonprofit generates 83 percent
of its revenue from several social enterprises, including janitorial, 
cleaning, and delivery services. Dale Rogers Training Center re-
ceives 100 percent of the profits from the pizza shop and is able to
fill 75 percent of the store’s jobs with its clients. Even though this
Papa Murphy’s restaurant hires people with disabilities, it has the
same standards for its employees as every other Papa Murphy’s 
store.

Ben and Jerry’s is a leader in providing franchises to support 
nonprofits, partnering with a variety of social ventures for more 
than 20 years. One of the first is a franchise owned by Common 
Ground, a New York nonprofit working to end homelessness. 
The partnership with Common Ground operates three Ben and
Jerry’s stores, which hire 15 clients served by the nonprofit. The 
stores each took two to three years to break even. Ben and 
Jerry’s partners with several programs providing employment
and life skills training for disadvantaged youth. It has five loca-
tions owned by Juma Ventures, which supports disadvantaged 
youth by offering them employment in its social enterprises 
with the goal of getting them ready to attend and complete 
college. Latin American Youth Center in Washington, D.C., 
Metro Community Investment in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and 
Youth Job Center of Evanston, Illinois, all operate Ben and Jerry’s 
to provide employment and life training for their clients. Ben 
and Jerry’s operates franchises through the Postgraduate Center 
for Mental Health in New York City and Second Chance in San 
Diego, California, to provide revenue for these nonprofits and
job training for their clients. Finally, youth participating in the
Chicago Children’s Choir raise money for the choir by singing
as they serve customers in a franchise operated in Chicago’s 
theater district.

Define social responsibility.
Social entrepreneurs use their creativity to develop solutions to social problems that range
from cleaning up the environment to improving working conditions for workers around the world;
their goal is to use their businesses to make money and to make the world a better place to live.

Social entrepreneurship is the fastest growing type of entrepreneurship in most parts of the 
world. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey of entrepreneurial activity reports that one-
third of entrepreneurs in the United States pursue a purely social entrepreneurial venture.31 Bill
Drayton, founder of Ashoka, an organization that promotes social entrepreneurship, says, “Social 
entrepreneurs are not content just to give a fish or teach [someone] how to fish. They will not rest 
until they have revolutionized the fishing industry.”32

an important issue facing much of Tanzania: Only 14 percent of its population has access to
electricity. Without reliable electricity, residents must rely on unsafe kerosene and disposable bat-
teries. These alternative power sources increase pollution and are expensive. EGG-energy seeks to 
provide developing countries with affordable electrical service. EGG-energy sends electricians to
customers’ homes or businesses to install a full electrical system, including high-efficiency LED
light bulbs, wiring, and switches for a small one-time fee. These systems are then powered by safe
and efficient rechargeable batteries that last about five evenings for a typical household. EGG-
energy charges customers a small subscription fee to swap a depleted battery with a fully charged
one. The EGG-energy system costs customers less than half of what they spent on kerosene and 
disposable batteries. As the electrical grid expands in Tanzania, customers can be connected using 
the wiring already installed by EGG-energy. “We want to concentrate enough demand in an area, 
such that it makes sense to come in and provide electrical services,” says Yang. As a social enter

Social Responsibility
The concept of social responsibility has evolved from that of a nebulous “do-gooder” to one of 
“social steward” with the expectation that businesses will produce benefits not only for them-
selves but also for society as a whole. Society is constantly redefining its expectations of busi-
ness and now holds companies of all sizes to high standards of ethics and social responsibility. 
Companies must go beyond “doing well”—simply earning a profit—to “doing good”—living 
up to their social responsibility. They also must recognize the interdependence of business and 
society. Each influences the other, and both must remain healthy to sustain each other over time. 
A growing recognition of social responsibility is true not only for large public corporations but 
also for small businesses. Two surveys by SurePayroll shed light on the scope of small business 
owners’ engagement in social responsibility. One survey reports that 55 percent of small busi-
nesses’ mission statements include a reference to achieving some type of social goal, and a sec-
ond report finds that 90 percent of small business owners give to charity and 70 percent donate 
both money and time to local causes.34
Companies that are most successful in meeting their social responsibility select causes that 
are consistent with their core values and their employees’ interests and skill sets. In fact, some
entrepreneurs allow employees to provide input into the decision concerning which causes to
support. A common strategy is to allow employees to provide pro bono work for the charitable 
organizations they support.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Doral Financial Corporation Doral Financial is a bank 
holding company that operates Doral Bank in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy has 
continued to languish since the Great Recession began in 2008. Doral Bank executives made the 
decision to create growth for their financial institution by supporting women entrepreneurs. To
help differentiate its brand, the bank moved from spending money on traditional advertising to
supporting philanthropic causes. In addition to its long-term support for breast cancer research, 
the bank began to offer free mammograms because breast cancer is a leading cause of death
among Puerto Rican women. The bank also donates funding to a nonprofit that provides micro
financing to help women start businesses. More than 25 women have received $50,000 loans 
through this initiative. Doral Bank also hosts several free seminars that target women entrepreneurs.

“It makes all the sense in the world. Rather than spending tons in advertising, our real investment 
is spending time assisting the community,” says Jesus Mendez, executive vice president of Puerto 
Rico operations at Doral Bank.35 ■
In a free enterprise system, companies that fail to respond to their customers’ needs and 
demands soon go out of business. Today, customers are increasingly demanding the companies they
buy goods and services from to be socially responsible. When customers shop for “value,” they no 
longer consider only the price–performance relationship of the product or service; they also con-
sider the company’s stance on social responsibility. Whether a company supports a social or an envi-
ronmental cause has a significant effect on shoppers’ behavior. A study by Penn Schoen Berland, in 
conjunction with Burson-Marsteller and Landor, reports that more than 75 percent of consumers say 
social responsibility is important in their purchasing decisions. The survey finds that 55 percent of 
consumers are more likely to choose a product that supports a certain cause when choosing between 
otherwise similar products and that 38 percent are willing to pay more for products with added 
social benefits.36 Other studies conclude that when price, service, and quality are equal among 
competitors, customers buy from the company that has the best reputation for social responsibility.
Other studies show a connection between social responsibility and profitability. One team 
of researchers evaluated 52 studies on corporate social responsibility that were conducted over 
30 years and concluded that a positive correlation existed between a company’s profitability and
its reputation for ethical, socially responsible behavior. The relationship also was self-reinforcing. 
“It’s a virtuous cycle,” says Sara Rynes, one of the researchers. “As a company becomes more 
socially responsible, its reputation and financial performance go up, which causes them to be-
come even more socially responsible.”37 The message is clear: Companies that incorporate social
responsibility into their competitive strategies outperform those that fail to do so. Today’s so-
cially wired, transparent economy makes ethical and socially responsible behavior highly visible 
and, conversely, improper behavior more difficult to hide.
One problem businesses face is defining just what socially responsible behavior is. Is it 
manufacturing environmentally friendly products? Is it donating a portion of profits to chari-
table organizations? Is it creating jobs in inner cities plagued by high unemployment levels? The 
nature of a company’s social responsibility efforts depends on how its owners, employees, and
other stakeholders define what it means to be socially responsible. Typically, businesses have
responsibilities to several key stakeholders, including the environment, employees, customers, 
investors, and the community. Table 2.6 lists simple ways that small businesses can practice 
social responsibility.
TABLE 2.6 Simple Ways for a Small Business to Be Socially Responsible
1. Encourage recycling. Place recycling bins throughout the workplace. If the business sells retail products, encourage customers 
to bring reusable shopping bags. Use recycled products whenever possible.
2. Support local fundraisers. Provide local fundraising events with donated products or services. Encourage employees to 
participate in fundraising events as a team representing the company.
3. Join in community service. Allow employees to participate in community volunteer projects on company time. Designate a 
day a year for all employees to help with a local charity, such as planting trees on Arbor Day, cleaning up a section of a local 
highway, helping with a Habitat for Humanity building project, or volunteering at an inner city school.
4. Reduce energy usage. Encourage employees to help find ways to reduce energy consumption in your business. Provide 
recognition to employees whose ideas help reduce energy usage.
5. Create a grant program. Set up a fund that local nonprofits can apply to for small grants. Create a matching program to 
encourage employee giving to the fund by committing to company matching donations for their gifts.
6. Support local causes. Work with employees to identify local causes that the business can support by offering publicity for that 
cause. Promotion can include flyers in the window, promotion on the company website, employee T-shirts supporting the cause, 
and social media campaigns.
7. Partner with local schools. Partner with local schools by providing supplies and encouraging employees to serve as volunteers. 
Mentor young people through a job shadowing program.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Business’s Responsibility to the Environment
Due to a strong personal belief in environmental protection, many entrepreneurs seek to start 
ventures that have a positive impact on the environment or take steps to operate their businesses
in ways that help protect the environment. Also driven by their customers’ interest in protect-
ing the environment, small businesses have become more sensitive to the impact their products,
processes, and packaging have on the planet. Environmentalism has become—and will continue 
to be—one of the dominant issues for companies worldwide because consumers have added
another item to their list of buying criteria: environmental friendliness and safety. Companies 
have discovered that sound environmental practices make for good business. In addition to lower-
ing their operating costs, environmentally safe products attract environmentally conscious cus-
tomers and can give a company a competitive edge in the marketplace. Socially responsible 
business owners focus on the three Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle:
● Reduce the amount of energy and materials used in your company, from the factory floor to
the copier room.
● Reuse whatever you can.
● Recycle the materials that you must dispose of.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Scott Kelly and Jenn Rezeli, Re:Vision Architecture
Scott Kelly and Jenn Rezeli practice their commitment to the environment in every aspect 
of their business. Re:Vision Architecture, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, specializes in sus-
tainable architecture consulting and offers targeted consulting services to developers, building 
owners, government agencies, manufacturers, schools, and design professionals. The company 
offers a full-service staff of architects and planners who can design a sustainable building to con-
serve natural resources, lower operating costs, and enrich designs. Beyond its design practices, 
Re:Vision Architecture’s business practices reflect its commitment to the environment. More than 
75 percent of office supplies come from recycled materials. The company also rewards employees 
for using public transportation and car-pooling.38 ■
Many progressive small companies are taking their environmental policies a step further, 
creating redesigned, “clean” manufacturing systems that focus on avoiding waste and pollu-
tion and using resources efficiently. That requires a different manufacturing philosophy. These
companies design their products, packaging, and processes from the start with the environment 
in mind, working to eliminate hazardous materials and by-products and looking for ways to turn 
what had been scrap into salable products. This approach requires an ecological evaluation of 
every part of the process, from the raw materials that go into a product to the disposal or reuse of 
the packaging that contains it.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Alan Machin, a student at the University of Nottingham, 
looked at the collection of old paint cans in his garage and came up with the idea for a 
better paint container. His design, which incorporates a tube with a one-way valve that keeps air
out so the paint does not dry up, won an award in the prestigious RSA Design competition. A
special coating protects the paint in the tube from extreme temperatures, and the hexagonally-
shaped outer package is more efficient to ship and store. Both the tube and the outer package are 
recyclable. Machin’s design is far superior to the traditional aluminum paint can, which has not
been updated since its invention in 1868. His clever paint package has the potential to reduce the 
60 to 70 million gallons of paint that people in the United States discard each year, which creates 
a serious environmental hazard. Several paint manufacturers have expressed interest in Machin’s 
earth-friendly packaging.39 ■
Business’s Responsibility to Employees
Few other stakeholders are as important to a business as its employees. It is common for man-
agers to say that their employees are their most valuable resource, but the truly excellent ones 
actually treat them that way. Employees are at the heart of increases in productivity, and they

add the personal touch that puts passion in customer service. In short, employees produce the 
winning competitive advantage for an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs who understand the value of 
their employees follow a few simple procedures by doing the following:
● Listening to employees and respecting their opinions
● Asking for their input and involving them in the decision-making process
● Providing regular feedback—positive and negative—to employees
● Telling them the truth—always
● Letting them know exactly what’s expected of them
● Rewarding employees for performing their jobs well
● Trusting them; creating an environment of respect and teamwork
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Delight, Co. Delight Co. is a Korean company that makes 
and distributes affordable hearing aid devices to the elderly population. To keep its prod-
ucts affordable, Delight manufactures standardized devices and distributes them through 
company-owned stores located throughout the country. Through its efficient operations, Delight 
sells its product for $299, which is equivalent to the government subsidy for hearing impaired 
people in Korea. Delight employs senior citizens to deliver the products from the headquarters 
to the branch stores and other hearing-impaired people to work in its manufacturing plant. 
Delight offers its employees a wide array of benefits, including subsidized meals, transportation, 
and housing. Also, Delight employees are eligible for company sponsored training and tuition 
reimbursement.40 ■
Several important issues face entrepreneurs who are trying to meet their social responsibility 
to employees, including cultural diversity, drug testing, sexual harassment and privacy.
Cultural Diversity in the Workplace
The United States has always been a nation of astonishing cultural diversity (see Figure 2.4), a 
trait that has imbued it with an incredible richness of ideas and creativity. Indeed, this diversity is
one of the driving forces behind the greatest entrepreneurial effort in the world, and it continues
to grow. The United States, in short, is moving toward a “minority majority,” and significant 
demographic shifts will affect virtually every aspect of business. Nowhere will this be more 
visible than in the makeup of the nation’s workforce (see Figure 2.5). In 2020, members of five

different generations will be working side by side in the United States.41 By 2039, the majority of 
the workforce in the United States will be a member of a minority.42 The Hispanic population is
the fastest-growing sector in the United States, and Hispanics now make up the largest minority 
population in the nation.
This rich mix of generations, cultures, and backgrounds within the workforce presents both
opportunities and challenges to employers. One of the chief benefits of a diverse workforce is the
rich blend of perspectives, skills, talents, and ideas employees have to offer. Also, the changing 
composition of the nation’s population will change business’s customer base. What better way
is there for an entrepreneur to deal with culturally diverse customers than to have a culturally
diverse workforce? George Chavel, president and CEO of Sodexo says that diversity creates
opportunities for organizations to be more effective in the global economy.43 Diversity is more 
than just checking boxes to ensure that a broad spectrum of people work in a business, however. 
Shirley Engelmeier, CEO of InclusionINC, recommends that entrepreneurs view diversity as a 
way to build the base of competencies needed to build successful businesses. She stresses that 
diversity is not about meeting a specific quota of different people. Diversity works only if it is tied 
to improving the profitability of the business.44

CHAPTER 2 • ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: DOING THE RIGHT THING
81
Managing a culturally diverse workforce presents a real challenge for employers, however. 
Molding workers with highly varied beliefs, backgrounds, and biases into a unified team takes 
time and commitment. Stereotypes, biases, and prejudices present barriers workers and managers 
must constantly overcome. Communication may require more effort because of language dif-f
ferences. In many cases, dealing with diversity causes a degree of discomfort for entrepreneurs 
because of the natural tendency to associate with people who are similar to us. These reasons
and others cause some entrepreneurs to resist the move to a more diverse workforce, a move that 
threatens their ability to create a competitive edge.
How can entrepreneurs achieve unity through diversity? The only way is by managing diver-
sity in the workforce. In its Best Practices of Private Sector Employers, an Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission task force suggests following a “SPLENDID” approach to diversity:
● Study. Business owners cannot solve problems they don’t know exist. Entrepreneurs 
must familiarize themselves with issues related to diversity, including relevant laws.
● Plan. Recognizing the makeup of the local population, entrepreneurs must set targets for 
diversity hiring and develop a plan for achieving them.
● Lead. A diversity effort starts at the top of the organization with managers communi-
cating their vision and goals to everyone in the company.
● Encourage. Company leaders must encourage employees at all levels of an organization 
to embrace the diversity plan.
● Notice.
N
Entrepreneurs must monitor their companies’ progress toward achieving diversity 
goals.
● Discussion. Managers must keep diversity on the company’s radar screen by communi-
cating the message that diversity is vital to business success.
● Inclusion.
I
Involving employees in the push to achieve diversity helps break down barriers 
that arise.
● Dedication. Achieving diversity in a business does not happen overnight, but entrepre-
neurs must be persistent in implementing their plans.45
The goal of diversity efforts is to create an environment in which all types of workers—
men, women, Hispanic, African American, white, disabled, homosexual, elderly, and others—
can flourish and can give top performances to their companies. In fact, researchers at Harvard 
University report that companies that embrace diversity are more productive than those that shun 
diversity. A distinguishing factor the companies supporting diversity share is the willingness of 
people to learn from their coworkers’ different backgrounds and life experiences.46
Managing a culturally diverse workforce requires a different way of thinking, and that 
requires training. In essence, diversity training will help make everyone aware of the dangers of 
bias, prejudice, and discrimination, however subtle or unintentional they may be. Managing a 
culturally diverse workforce successfully requires a business owner to do the following:
Assess your company’s diversity needs. The starting point for an effective diversity man-
agement program is assessing a company’s needs. Surveys, interviews, and informal con-
versations with employees can be valuable tools. Several organizations offer more formal 
assessment tools—cultural audits, questionnaires, and diagnostic forms—that also are useful.
Learn to recognize and correct your own biases and stereotypes. One of the best ways 
to identify your own cultural biases is to get exposure to people who are not like you. By 
spending time with those who are different from you, you will learn quickly that stereo-
types simply don’t hold up. Giving employees the opportunity to spend time with one an-
other is an excellent way to eliminate stereotypes. The owner of one small company with a 
culturally diverse staff provides lunch for his workers every month with a seating arrange-
ment that encourages employees to mix with one another.
Avoid making invalid assumptions. Decisions that are based on faulty assumptions are 
bound to be flawed. False assumptions built on inaccurate perceptions or personal bias 

82
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
have kept many qualified minority workers from getting jobs and promotions. Make sure 
that it does not happen in your company.
Push for diversity in your management team. To get maximum benefit from a culturally 
diverse workforce, a company must promote nontraditional workers into top management. 
A culturally diverse top management team that can serve as mentors and role models 
provides visible evidence that nontraditional workers can succeed.
Concentrate on communication. Any organization, especially a culturally diverse one, 
will stumble if lines of communication break down. Frequent training sessions and regular 
opportunities for employees to talk with one another in a nonthreatening environment can 
be extremely helpful.
Make diversity a core value in the organization. For a cultural diversity program to work, 
top managers must “champion” the program and take active steps to integrate diversity 
throughout the entire organization.
Continue to adjust your company to your workers. Rather than pressure workers to con-
form to the company, entrepreneurs with the most successful cultural diversity programs are 
constantly looking for ways to adjust their businesses to their workers. Flexibility is the key.
As business leaders look to the future, an increasingly diverse workforce stares back. People 
with varying cultural, racial, gender and lifestyle perspectives seek opportunity and acceptance 
from coworkers, managers, and business owners. Currently, women make up 46 percent of the 
U.S. workforce, and minority workers make up more than 33 percent of the labor force.47 Busi-
nesses that value the diversity of their workers and the perspectives they bring to work enjoy 
the benefits of higher employee satisfaction, commitment, retention, creativity, and productivity 
more than those companies that ignore the cultural diversity of their workers. In addition, they
deepen the loyalty of their existing customers and expand their market share by attracting new 
customers. In short, diversity is a winning proposition from every angle!
Drug Testing
One of the realities of our society is substance abuse. The second reality, which entrepreneurs now 
must face head on, is that substance abuse has infiltrated the workplace. In addition to the lives it 
ruins, substance abuse takes a heavy toll on business and society. Drug and alcohol abuse by employ-
ees results in reduced productivity (an estimated $262.8 billion per year), increased medical costs, 
higher accident rates, and higher levels of absenteeism. Alarmingly, 66 percent of all drug abusers 
and 77 percent of alcohol abusers are employed.48 Small companies bear a disproportionate share of 
the burden because they are less likely to have drug-testing programs than large companies and are 
more likely to hire people with substance abuse problems. Abusers who know that they cannot pass a
drug test simply apply for work at companies that do not use drug tests. In addition, because the prac-
tice of drug testing remains a controversial issue, its random use can lead to a variety of legal woes 
for employers, including invasion of privacy, discrimination, slander, or defamation of character.
An effective, proactive drug program should include the following five elements:
1. A written substance abuse policy. The first step is to create a written policy that spells out 
the company’s position on drugs. The policy should state its purpose, prohibit the use of 
drugs on the job (or off the job if it affects job performance), specify the consequences of 
violating the policy, explain the drug-testing procedures the company will use, and describe 
the resources available to help troubled employees.
2. Training for supervisors to detect substance-abusing workers. Supervisors are in the best 
position to identify employees with alcohol or drug problems and to encourage them to get 
help. The supervisor’s job, however, is not to play “cop” or “therapist.” The supervisor should 
identify problem employees early and encourage them to seek help. The focal point of the 
supervisor’s role is to track employees’ performances against their objectives to identify the 
employees with performance problems. Vigilant managers look for the following signs:
● Frequent tardiness or absences accompanied by questionable excuses
● Long lunch, coffee, or bathroom breaks

CHAPTER 2 • ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: DOING THE RIGHT THING
83
● Frequently missed deadlines
● Withdrawal from or frequent arguments with fellow employees
● Excessive sensitivity to criticism
● Declining or inconsistent productivity
● Inability to concentrate on work
● Disregard for personal safety or the safety of others
● Deterioration of personal appearance
3. An employee education program. Business owners should take time to explain the 
company’s substance abuse policy, the reasons behind it, and the help that is available to
employees who have substance abuse problems. Every employee should participate in 
training sessions, and managers should remind employees periodically of the policy, the 
magnitude of the problem, and the help that is available. Some companies have used inserts
in pay envelopes, home mailings, lunch speakers, and short seminars as part of their 
ongoing educational efforts.
4. A drug-testing program, when necessary. Experts recommend that business owners 
seek the advice of an experienced attorney before establishing a drug-testing program. 
Preemployment testing of job applicants generally is a safe strategy to follow as long as it 
is followed consistently, however in many cases you can only test someone if they already 
have a conditional offer for employment from your company. Testing current employees
is a more complex issue, but, again, consistency is the key. If you test one employee, you 
should test them all.
5. An employee assistance program. No drug-battling program is complete without a way to 
help addicted employees. An employee assistance program (EAP) is a company-provided 
benefit designed to help reduce workplace problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction, 
a gambling habit, and others and to deal with them when they arise. Although some 
troubled employees may balk at enrolling in an EAP, the company controls the most pow-
erful weapon in motivating them to seek and accept help: their jobs. The greatest fear that 
substance-abusing employees have is losing their jobs, and the company can use that fear 
to help workers recover. EAPs, which cost between $18 and $30 per employee each year to 
operate, are an effective weapon in the battle against workplace substance abuse. Research
shows that EAPs can pay for themselves quickly by reducing absenteeism and tardiness by 
25 percent and increasing productivity by 25 percent.49 Unfortunately, only 21 percent of 
small companies (compared to 76 percent of large companies) offer EAPs.50

shows that 15.1 percent of workers in the construction industry had substance abuse problems, 
second only to the food service industry. Initially, Eastern’s substance abuse policy was simple: We 
test for drugs, and if you fail the test, you are fired. The all-or-nothing policy affected the com-
pany’s ability to keep and retain skilled workers, so managers decided to adopt a new policy that
includes prevention, testing, and rehabilitation. Eastern includes educational sessions on sub-
stance abuse in its employee orientation program and ongoing programs for all workers. If an 
employee fails a drug test, he or she can enroll in an employee assistance program including
rehabilitation that, once successfully completed, allows the worker to return to his or her job. 
Managers at Eastern say the program has been a tremendous success, allowing them to keep 
good workers they would have lost under the old policy and giving employees the opportunity to 
correct bad decisions and keep their jobs.51 ■
Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment is a problem in the workplace. Thousands of workers file sexual harassment 
charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against their employers 
every year. Since awareness of sexual harassment has increased, there has been a steady decline 
in charges filed over the past decade. Sexual harassment is a violation of Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and is considered to be a form of sex discrimination. Studies show that 
employee assistance 
program (EAP)
a company-provided benefit 
designed to help reduce 
workplace problems such as 
alcoholism, drug addiction, 
a gambling habit, and other 
conflicts and to deal with 
them when they arise.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
sexual harassment occurs in businesses of all sizes, but small businesses are especially vulnerable 
because they typically lack the policies, procedures, and training to prevent it.
Sexual harassment is any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors, and other 
verbal or physical sexual conduct made explicitly or implicitly as a condition of employment. 
Women bring about 82 percent of all sexual harassment charges.52 Jury verdicts reaching into the 
millions of dollars are not uncommon. In 2013, there were 7,256 sexual harassment claims filed
with the EEOC that yielded a total of $44.6 million in settlements to the victims.53 Retaliation,
such as demotions and assignments to less attractive work against employees who file complaints 
of sexual harassment, occurs too often, but the most common form of employer retaliation is ter-
mination. Types of behavior that may result in sexual harassment charges include the following.
QUID PRO QUO HARASSMENT The most blatant and most potentially damaging form of sexual
harassment is quid pro quo (“this for that”), in which a superior conditions the granting of a 
benefit such as a promotion or raise on the receipt of sexual favors from a subordinate. Only
managers and supervisors, not coworkers, can engage in quid pro quo harassment.
HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT Behavior that creates an abusive, intimidating, offensive, or hostile 
work environment also constitutes sexual harassment. A hostile environment usually requires 
a pattern of offensive sexual behavior rather than a single, isolated remark or display. When 
judging whether a hostile environment exists, courts base their decisions on how a “reasonable 
woman” would perceive the situation. (The previous standard was that of a “reasonable person.”) 
Examples of what creates a hostile work environment might include the following:
● Displaying sexually suggestive pictures or posters
● Engaging in sexually related humor within hearing of someone who takes offense
● Talking about sexual matters where others can hear (as in colorfully relating one’s 
“conquests”)
● Making sexual comments to other employees
● Dispensing assignments based on sexual orientation
● Repeatedly asking a coworker for a date after having been refused multiple times54
Although not easily defined, a hostile work environment is one in which continuing unwel-
come sexual conduct in the workplace interferes with an employee’s work performance. Sexual 
harassment is sexually related behavior that is unwelcome, unwanted, and repeated. Most sexual
harassment charges arise from claims of a hostile environment.
HARASSMENT BY NONEMPLOYEES An employer can be held liable for third parties (customers, 
sales representatives, and others) who engage in sexual harassment if the employer has the ability 
to stop the improper behavior. For example, one company required a female employee to wear an 
extremely skimpy, revealing uniform. She complained to her boss that the uniform encouraged
members of the public to direct offensive comments and physical contact toward her. The 
manager ignored her complaints, and later she refused to wear the uniform, which resulted in her 
dismissal. When she filed a sexual harassment claim, the court held the company accountable for 
the employee’s sexual harassment by nonemployees because it required her to wear the uniform
after she complained of harassment.55
No business wants to incur the cost of defending itself against charges of sexual harass-
ment, but those costs can be devastating for a small business. Multi-million-dollar jury awards
in harassment cases are becoming increasingly common because the Civil Rights Act of 1991
allows victims to collect punitive damages and emotional distress awards. A jury awarded eight 
former employees of Four Amigos Travel, Inc. and Top Dog Travel, Inc. $20,251,963 after they
won a lawsuit claiming daily sexual harassment of women employees in the workplace. The 
complaint was filed against travel agency owner Ronald Schlom and male managers by employ-
ees describing unwanted sexual advances, physical touching, and repeated propositions for sex.
The suit described a work environment that was filled with sexual banter, abuse of power, and 
outright disrespect for women. The company fired the manager who brought forward the victims’
sexual harassment
any unwelcome sexual 
advance, request for 
sexual favors, and other 
verbal or physical sexual 
conduct made explicitly or 
implicitly as a condition of 
employment.

complaints. The jury returned a unanimous verdict awarding $3.75 million in compensatory dam-
ages, $16 million in punitive damages, and $501,963 in back pay to the former employees. “This 
was a long journey for these women who were forced to work under unspeakable conditions 
at this workplace,” said Gregory Lee McClinton, the EEOC’s lead attorney in the case. “Their 
testimony about how the sexual harassment occurred and how it affected their lives was very 
powerful.”56
The U.S. Supreme Court has expanded the nature of an employer’s liability for sexual 
harassment, rejecting the previous standard that the employer had to be negligent to be liable 
for a supervisor’s improper behavior toward employees. In Burlington Industries v. Ellerth, the 
court ruled that an employer can be held liable automatically if a supervisor takes a “tangible 
employment action,” such as failing to promote or firing an employee whom he has been sexually 
harassing. The employer is liable even if he or she was not aware of the supervisor’s conduct. If 
a supervisor takes no tangible employment action against an employee but engages in sexually
harassing behavior, such as offensive remarks, inappropriate touching, or sexual advances, the 
employer is not automatically liable for the supervisor’s conduct. However, an employer would 
be liable for such conduct if, for example, he or she knew (or should have known) about the 
supervisor’s behavior and failed to stop it.57
A company’s best weapons against sexual harassment are education, policy, and procedures.
EDUCATION Preventing sexual harassment is the best solution, and the key to prevention is
educating employees about what constitutes sexual harassment. Training programs are designed 
to raise employees’ awareness of what might be offensive to other workers and how to avoid 
sexual harassment altogether.
POLICY Another essential ingredient is a meaningful policy against sexual harassment that 
management can enforce. The policy should do the following:
● Clearly define what behaviors constitute sexual harassment
● State in clear language that harassment will not be tolerated in the workplace
● Identify the responsibilities of supervisors and employees in preventing harassment
● Define the sanctions and penalties for engaging in harassment
● Spell out the steps to take in reporting an incident of sexual harassment
In another case, the Supreme Court ruled that an employer was liable for a supervisor’s 
sexually harassing behavior even though the employee never reported it. The company’s liability 
stemmed from its failure to communicate its sexual harassment policy throughout the organiza-
tion. This ruling makes employers’ policies and procedures on sexual harassment the focal point 
of their defense.
PROCEDURE Socially responsible companies provide a channel for all employees to express their 
complaints. Choosing a person inside the company (perhaps someone in the human resources 
area) and one outside the company (a close adviser or attorney) is a good strategy because it 
gives employees a choice about how to file a complaint. At least one of these people should be a
woman. When a complaint arises, managers should do the following:
● Listen to the complaint carefully without judging. Taking notes is a good idea. Tell the 
complainant what the process involves. Never treat the complaint as a joke.
● Investigate the complaint promptly, preferably within 24 hours. Failure to act quickly is 
irresponsible and illegal. Table 2.7 offers suggestions for conducting a sexual harassment 
investigation.
● Interview the accused party and any witnesses who may be aware of a pattern of harassing 
behavior privately and separately.
● Keep findings confidential.
● Decide what action to take, relying on company policy as a guideline.

86
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
● Inform both the complaining person and the alleged harasser of the action taken.
● Document the entire investigation.58
The accompanying “Hands On . . . How To” feature includes a quiz on sexual harassment for both 
employees and managers.
TABLE 2.7 What to Do When an Employee Files a Sexual Harassment Complaint
When an employee files a sexual harassment complaint, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recommends that 
employers (1) gather detailed information about the complaint from both of the parties involved and (2) seek out other evidence that 
helps explain what happened. The following checklist helps to ensure that EEOC recommendations are adhered to:
●
Careful assess the victim’s statements to ensure that it is consistent throughout and credible.
●
Do not weight the accused party’s statement of denial too heavily.
●
Seek evidence that supports both party’s stories, not just evidence that supports or refutes the accusations through careful 
interviews of other employees close to the situation and by talking to those who the victim confided in about the events that they 
claim occurred, such as coworkers or professionals.
●
Ask other employees about any changes in how the two parties interact in the workplace both before and after the alleged 
incident.
●
Examine the background of the victim and the accused for other similar incidences looking for patterns, making sure to follow up 
with other employees who may have claimed similar harassment.
To make a just decision on a sexual harassment complaint, gather as much information as possible, not only about the events in
question but also about general information about both parties. Ask probing questions of the victim, the accuser and of all witnesses 
to the alleged incident.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission handles about 
7,500 charges of sexual harassment each year from both women
and men. Not surprisingly, women file 82 percent of the charges.
Experts say many other employees are sexually harassed but never
file charges because of the stigma associated with doing so. What 
can you do to ensure you provide your employees a safe work 
environment that is free of sexual harassment? Consider the fol-
lowing case and then take the accompanying quizzes on sexual 
harassment.
Theresa Waldo was the only woman working in the Trans-
mission Lines Department, a traditionally male-dominated job 
in which workers maintain and repair high-voltage power lines,
sometimes at heights up to 250 feet, for Consumers Energy (CE). 
Her supervisor told her the company did not “have women in this 
department” and had never had them there and that “they are 
not strong enough” to do the job. Despite resistance from her 
supervisor and coworkers, Waldo, who started her career with CE 
as a meter reader, was participating in a four-year Line Apprentice
Training Program that would entitle her to a higher-paying job. 
Hands On . . . How To
How to Avoid Sexual Harassment Charges
On several occasions, Waldo’s supervisor told her that he would
“wash her out” of the apprenticeship program.
During her time in the apprenticeship program, Waldo
alleges that she faced an “abusive and dysfunctional environ-
ment” in which she was constantly “bombarded with sexually 
abusive and derogatory language and conduct.” Male coworkers 
subjected her to magazines, calendars, playing cards, and other 
items that contained photographs of nude women. They also re-
ferred to Waldo using derogatory, sexually offensive names and on 
one 90-degree day intentionally locked her in a port-a-potty for
20 minutes. On another occasion, her supervisor ordered her to 
clean up the tobacco spit of the male workers; when she refused,
her coworkers locked her in a trailer. Waldo complained to the 
company’s management about the sexual harassment on several 
occasions, but managers failed to take any meaningful action to 
stop the behavior.
After Waldo had successfully completed three years of the 
apprenticeship program, CE removed her from it and transferred
her to the Sub Metro Department, where her pay was $4 less per

A Test for Managers
Answer the following true/false questions:
1. Men in male-dominated workplaces usually have to change 
their behavior when a woman begins working there.
2. Employers are not liable for the sexual harassment of one 
of their employees unless that employee loses specific job 
benefits or is fired.
3. Supervisors can be liable for sexual harassment committed 
by one of their employees against another.
4. Employers can be liable for the sexually harassing behavior 
of management personnel even if they are unaware of that 
behavior and have a policy forbidding it.
5. It is appropriate for a supervisor, when initially receiving a 
sexual harassment complaint, to determine if the alleged 
recipient overreacted or misunderstood the alleged harasser.
6. When a supervisor is to tell an employee that an allegation 
of sexual harassment has been made against him or her by 
another employee, it is best for the supervisor to ease into 
the allegation instead of being direct.
7. Sexually suggestive visuals or objects in a workplace don’t
create a liability unless an employee complains about them 
and management allows them to remain.
8. The lack of sexual harassment complaints is a good indica-
tion that sexual harassment is not occurring.
9. It is appropriate for supervisors to tell an employee to han-
dle unwelcome sexual behavior if they think the employee is 
misunderstanding the behavior.
10. The intent behind employee A’s sexual behavior is more
t
important than the impact of that behavior on employee B
t
when determining if sexual harassment has occurred.
11. If a sexual harassment problem is common knowledge in 
a workplace, courts assume that the employer has knowl-
edge of it.
[1. Yes. Although the jury in the trial ruled in favor of the em-
ployer on all claims, the judge granted Waldo’s motion for a new 
r
trial, acknowledging that the jury’s verdict on the hostile work 
environment and sexual harassment should be set aside because 
of the “clear evidence presented” in the case. The court ruled 
that the evidence “demonstrated egregious actions and sexually
 offensive and demeaning language” directed at Waldo. The court 
concluded that the harassment created “an intimidating, hostile,
and offensive work environment” and that CE “knew of the ha-
rassment and failed to implement proper and appropriate correc-
tive action.” At the second trial, a jury ruled in Waldo’s favor and
granted her $400,000 in compensatory damages and $7.5 million 
in punitive damages.]

hour. She filed a sexual harassment charge, alleging that the com-
pany had created a hostile work environment, committed sexual 
harassment, and engaged in gender discrimination and retaliation.
1. Does Waldo have a legitimate sexual harassment com-
plaint? Explain.
One of the primary causes of sexual harassment in the work-
place is the lack of education concerning what constitutes ha-
rassment. The following quizzes ask you to assume the roles of 
an employee and of a manager when answering the questions.
Learning from these quizzes can help your company avoid prob-
lems with sexual harassment.
A Test for Employees
Answer the following true/false questions:
1. If I just ignore unwanted sexual attention, it will usually 
stop.
2. If I don’t mean to sexually harass another employee, he or 
she cannot perceive my behavior as sexually harassing.
3. Some employees don’t complain about unwanted sexual 
attention from another worker because they don’t want to 
get that person in trouble.
4. If I make sexual comments to someone and that person 
doesn’t ask me to stop, I can assume that my behavior is 
welcome.
5. To avoid sexually harassing a woman who comes to work 
in a traditionally male workplace, men simply should not 
haze her.
6. A sexual harasser may be told by a court to pay part of a 
judgment to the employee he or she harassed.
7. A sexually harassed man does not have the same legal 
rights as a woman who is sexually harassed.
8. About 84 percent of all sexual harassment in today’s 
workplace is male to female harassment.
9. Sexually suggestive pictures or objects in a workplace don’t
create a liability unless someone complains.
10. Displaying nude pictures can constitute a hostile work en-
vironment even though most employees in the workplace 
think they are harmless.
Answers: (1) False, (2) False, (3) True, (4) True, (5) False, (6) False, 
(7) False, (8) False, (9) False, (10) False, (11) True.
11. Telling someone to stop his or her unwanted sexual
behavior usually doesn’t do any good.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP

Explain business’s 
responsibility to customers.
Privacy
Modern technology has given business owners the ability to monitor workers’ performance as 
they never could before, but where is the line between monitoring productivity and invasion of 
privacy? With a few mouse clicks, it is possible for managers to view e-mail messages employees
send to one another, listen to voice-mail or telephone conversations, and actually see what is on
their monitors while they are sitting at their computer terminals. Some employers have begun to 
demand Facebook usernames and passwords from job applicants although this is a violation of 
the Facebook terms of use, has been made illegal in several states, and is considered by many
experts to be a violation of employee privacy. Employers have established policies that pro-
hibit employees from stating negative information—or in some cases any information—about 
the company in any social media (including Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and so forth). Employers 
can monitor all activities, including Web usage and text messages that employees send on their 
employer-issued smart phones. Managers use electronic monitoring to track customer service
representatives, word-processing clerks, data entry technicians, and other workers for speed, ac-
curacy, and productivity. Even truck drivers, the “lone rangers of the road,” are not immune to
electronic tracking. Most trucking companies outfit their trucks with GPS devices they use to
monitor drivers’ exact locations at all times, regulate their speed, make sure they stop only at 
approved fueling points, and ensure that they take the legally required hours of rest. Although 
many drivers support the use of these devices, others worry about their tendency to create George 
Orwell’s “Big Brother” syndrome.
E-mail also poses an ethical problem for employers. Internet users have more than 4.1 billion 
e-mail accounts worldwide (974 million of which are business e-mail accounts), and people 
send more than 108 billion business e-mails per day.59 Most workers do not realize that, in most 
states, employers legally can monitor their e-mail and voice-mail messages without notification. 
However, this is limited to company e-mail accounts; employers cannot monitor personal e-mail 
accounts. Only two states (Connecticut and Delaware) require companies to notify employees 
that they are monitoring e-mail.
To avoid ethical and legal problems, business owners should follow these guidelines:
● Establish a clear policy for monitoring employees’ communications. Employees should 
know that the company is monitoring their e-mails and other forms of communication, and 
the best way to make sure they do is to create an unambiguous policy. Once you create a 
policy, be sure to follow it. Some managers ask employees to sign a consent form acknowl-
edging that they have read and understand the company’s monitoring policy.
● Create guidelines for the proper use of the company’s communication technology and 
communicate them to everyone. A company’s policies and guidelines should be reason-
able and should reflect employees’ reasonable expectations of privacy.
● Monitor in moderation. Employees resent monitoring that is unnecessarily invasive. In 
addition, excessively draconian monitoring may land a company in a legal battle.
Business’s Responsibility to Customers
One of the most important group of stakeholders that a business must satisfy is its custom-
ers. Building and maintaining a base of loyal customers is no easy task because it requires 
more than just selling a product or a service. The key is to build long-term relationships with 
customers. Socially responsible companies recognize their duty to abide by the Consumer 
Bill of Rights, first put forth by President John Kennedy. This document gives consumers the
following rights.
Right to Safety
The right to safety is the most basic consumer right. Companies have the responsibility to provide 
their customers with safe, quality products and services. The greatest breach of trust occurs when 
businesses produce products that, when properly used, injure customers.

CHAPTER 2 • ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: DOING THE RIGHT THING
89
There has been increasing attention given to employee posts on
social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. The National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and several judges have begun to 
define what is protected, private speech when it is posted on a 
personal Facebook or Twitter account. Several cases have helped
bring this issue into focus.
Employee Rants about Tip
The owner of a New York City food truck called the Milk Truck 
fired an employee, Brendan O’Connor, when he tweeted from his
personal Twitter account about not receiving a tip. Glass, Lewis &
Co. employees ordered $170 worth of grilled cheese sandwiches
and milkshakes. After not receiving any tip, O’Conner tweeted, 
“Shout out to the good people of Glass, Lewis & Co. for placing a 
$170 order and not leaving a tip. @glasslewis.” After Glass, Lewis & 
Co. employees found the tweets, the company expressed its dis-
pleasure to the owner of Milk Truck. O’Connor was promptly fired
by the owner, who said O’Conner had embarrassed the company. 
The owner of Milk Truck apologized to Glass, Lewis & Co., via 
Twitter. The apology was accepted. However, O’Connor has more
than 300 followers on his Twitter account. Most of the discussion 
on Twitter about O’Connor’s firing blasted both Milk Truck and 
Glass, Lewis & Co.
Tweets about Illegal Activity
Sunith Baheerathan, an employee of Mr. Lube in Toronto, Ontario,
used Twitter to try to find dealers to buy marijuana. In his tweets,
he suggested that dealers could bring the drugs to Mr. Lube, 
where he was working. The tweet went viral and soon came to 
the attention of the police, who joined in the Twitter conversation.
“Awesome! Can we come too?” read a tweet sent by the York
Regional Police’s official Twitter feed. Baheerathan’s next tweet
read “Just got the call of termination.” Another of his tweets said,
“Gotta watch what you tweet nowadays, even the freedom of 
speech & the right to an entitled opinion isn’t safe.”
New Hire Loses Offer
Connor Riley had just gotten a job offer from CISCO Systems, 
which is based in San Jose, California. Riley was pursuing a mas-
ter’s degree in information systems and management at the 
University of California, Berkeley. After receiving her offer, Riley
tweeted, “Cisco just offered me a job! Now I have to weigh the 
utility of a fatty paycheck against the daily commute to San Jose 
and hating the work.” It was not too long before Riley received a 
reply tweet from someone who claimed to be a Cisco employee. 
It read, “Who is the hiring manager? I’m sure they would love to
know that you will hate the work. We here at Cisco are versed in 
the Web.” Riley is not working at Cisco, after all.
Although the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) protects 
the use of Facebook and Twitter as equivalent to the modern-day 
water cooler, there are limits on what speech is protected in so-
cial media. Employees can use social media to communicate with
each other about work conditions, for example. However, there
are clear limits on social media posts that are abusive, target indi-
viduals, give away company secrets and so forth. The boundaries 
between protected speech and posts that might leave employees 
subject to disciplinary action remain a gray area of employment
law. Employees should be careful when they tweet, and employers
should have clear policies that fall within the emerging guidelines 
established by the courts and the NLRB.
1. If you were the judge reviewing the O’Connor case, how 
would you rule? Explain your reasoning.
2. If you were the judge in the Riley case, how would you rule? 
Explain your reasoning.
3. What policies would you put in place as a business owner 
about employee comments on social media sites like Face-
book and Twitter? Explain your policies based on the cases 
discussed here.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Product liability cases can be controversial, such as the McDonald’s coffee lawsuit, in which
a jury found that the fast-food giant’s coffee was too hot when served and caused a serious injury 
when a customer at a drive-through window spilled coffee in her lap. In other situations, the evi-
dence is clear that a product suffers from fundamental flaws in either design or construction and 
caused an injury to its user when used properly.
Many companies have responded by placing detailed warning labels on their products that 
sometimes insult customers’ intelligence. Consider the following actual examples from product 
warning labels:
● “Does not supply oxygen” on a dust mask
● “Caution: Do not swallow” on a clothes hanger
● “Wash hands after using” on a common extension cord
● “Not for human consumption,” a warning on a package of plastic fishing worms
● “Combustion of this manufactured product results in the emissions of carbon monoxide, 
soot and other combustion by-products which are known by the State of California to cause 
cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm” on a box of matches
● “Do not use while sleeping,” a product warning for a Vidal Sassoon hair dryer
● “This product is not intended for use as a dental drill” on a Dremel rotary power tool60
Right to Know
Consumers have the right to honest communication about the products and services they buy and 
the companies that sell them. In a free market economy, information is one of the most valuable 
commodities available. Customers often depend on companies for the information they need to 
make decisions about price, quality, features, and other factors. As a result, companies have a 
responsibility to customers to be truthful in their advertising.
Unfortunately, not every business recognizes its social responsibility to be truthful in
advertising. The Federal Trade Commission reached a settlement requiring Reebok to refund 
$25 million to customers because its advertising promised, without any evidence, that the com-
pany’s EasyTone shoes could firm users’ butts and legs with every step.61 Businesses that rely on
unscrupulous tactics may profit in the short term, but they will not last in the long run.
Right to Be Heard
The right to be heard suggests that the channels of communication between companies and their 
customers run in both directions. Socially responsible businesses provide customers with a mech-
anism for resolving complaints about products and services. Some companies have established
a consumer ombudsman to address customer questions and complaints. Others have created
customer hot lines, toll-free numbers designed to serve customers more effectively. Today, many 
businesses actively monitor social media, watching for customer complaints or negative com-
ments that customers make about the company or its products and services and then addressing 
them promptly.
Another effective technique for encouraging two-way communication between customers 
and companies is the customer report card. The Granite Rock Company, a business that supplies
a variety of building materials to construction companies, relies on an annual report card from its 
customers to learn how to serve them better. Although the knowledge an entrepreneur gets from 
customer feedback is immeasurable for making improvements, only 1 in 12 small companies
regularly schedules customer satisfaction surveys such as Granite Rock’s. This tool can boost a
company’s profitability significantly.
Right to Education
Socially responsible companies give customers access to educational material about their prod-
ucts and services and how to use them properly. The goal is to give customers enough informa-
tion to make informed purchase decisions. A product that is the wrong solution to the customer’s 
needs results in a disappointed customer who is likely to blame the manufacturer or retailer for the 

CHAPTER 2 • ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: DOING THE RIGHT THING

Kali Hardig, a 12-year-old from Arkansas, spent a day swimming 
and enjoying the attractions at Willow Springs Water Park. Willow
Springs was a popular local attraction that offered a lake for
swimming, a water slide, water trampolines, concessions, and a 
picnic area. A day after her visit to Willow Springs, Kali’s mother 
rushed her to the hospital. She had a high fever, was vomiting,
and had an excruciating headache. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention and the Arkansas Department of Public Health de-
termined that Kali had contracted parasitic meningitis caused by a
brain-eating amoeba.
The amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri, enters through 
the noses of people who come into contact with contami-
nated water or soil. Most cases occur in the summer because 
the amoeba is most often found in water that is 115 degrees 
Fahrenheit. The amoeba can enter a human victim only through
the nose. Drinking contaminated water cannot lead to infection. 
The amoeba moves from the nose into the brain, causing the brain 
to swell (meningitis), and in 99 percent of cases leads to the death 
of the infected person. Naegleria is very rare, with only 128 cases 
ever reported in the United States. However, only two people have 
survived this infection. Doctors put Kali into a drug-induced coma
to help her fight the infection.
This was the second case of Naegleria linked to Willow
Springs. Authorities believe that another person was infected at
the water park in 2010. However, the owners of the park said 
they had not been informed about the first infection until Kali’s 
case was diagnosed. Authorities admit that the exact source of the 
strain is not traceable to a specific location, but were convinced
that the chronology of events and other evidence strongly linked
both cases to the lake at Willow Springs. The Arkansas Depart-
ment of Public Health asked the owners of the water park to vol-
untarily close the park to protect public health. David and Lou Ann 
Ratliff, owners of Willow Springs Water Park, said in a statement:
“We, David and Lou Ann Ratliff, as general management of 
Willow Springs Water Park, have received new information re-
garding Naegleria fowleri, and have elected to close the park as 
of July 25 at the request of the Arkansas Department of Health.
Though the odds of contracting Naegleria are extremely low, 
they are just not good enough to allow our friends or family to
swim. For the thousands of people who love Willow Springs, 
we will be taking this time to determine the feasibility of in-
stalling a solid bottom to the lake. We will not ever reopen as
a sand bottom lake. We covet your prayers and our Willow 
Springs family will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers.”
The owners of Willow Springs are not sure about the future
of their business or what else they might do with the property.
Willow Springs first opened as a water park in 1928. David Ratliff 
was exploring the possibility of building a hard surface for the 
lake bottom. However, given the high cost of this alternative, he 
said he doubts they will be able reopen as a water park. They are
exploring alternative businesses that will attract local residents as
customers.
By August, Kali was showing signs of recovery. She woke up 
and spoke briefly to her mother. By early September Kali was able to
leave the hospital for short trips with her mother to go to the mov-
ies and eat at local restaurants. On September 11, 2013, against all 
odds, Kali was released to go home from the hospital. She had be-
come only the third person to recover from the Naegleria infection.
1. How could the owners of Willow Springs have ensured the 
safety of their customers and prevented the infections from
occurring? Explain.
2. Would it have been ethical for Willow Springs to remain
open after Kali’s case came to light even though there could 
never be definitive evidence linking the infection to their 
lake? Explain.
3. What do you think the owners of Willow Springs should do 
with their property? Should they reopen the water park if 
they can ensure that the water is safe to swim in? Explain.
4. Create a detailed diagram of all of the stakeholders of 
Willow Springs. How is each of the stakeholders affected by
the water park’s actions? What conclusions can you draw 
from this analysis? Explain.

mistake. Consumer education is an inexpensive investment in customer satisfaction (especially 
when done online) and the increased probability that a satisfied customer will be a repeat buyer.
Right to Choice
Inherent in the free enterprise system is the consumer’s right to choose among competing prod-
ucts and services. Socially responsible companies do not restrict competition, and they abide by 

92
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
U.S. antitrust policy, which promotes free trade and competition in the market. The foundation 
of this policy is the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which forbids agreements among sellers that 
restrain trade or commerce and outlaws any attempts to monopolize markets.
Business’s Responsibility to Investors
Companies have the responsibility to provide investors with an attractive return on their invest-
ments. Although earning a profit may be a company’s first responsibility, it is not its
t
only respon-
sibility; meeting its ethical and social responsibility goals is also a key to success. Investors today
want to know that entrepreneurs are making ethical decisions and acting in a socially responsible 
manner. Those who invest in entrepreneurial ventures are a small community (see Chapter 13). 
Reputation can mean everything for an entrepreneur because most investors invest more on the 
basis of the entrepreneur’s track record than on the entrepreneur’s idea. Maintaining high stan-
dards of ethics and social responsibility translates into a business culture that sets the stage for 
future equity investments and in more profitable business operations.
Companies also have the responsibility to report their financial performance in an accurate 
and timely fashion to their investors. Businesses that misrepresent or falsify their financial and 
operating records are guilty of violating the fiduciary relationship with their investors.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Russell Daniel, Daniel Enterprises, Inc. Russell Daniel, 
of Louisville, Kentucky, offered investors a healthy return on their investments in his firm, 
Daniel Enterprises. Daniel promised his investors returns on their investments of 10 to 15 percent. 
He said their investments would be used to purchase and rehabilitate houses, which in return
would be sold for a profit. Daniel used the money received from investors to pay out returns 
promised to previous investors and for unrelated personal investments. Daniel provided investors 
with false and fictitious mortgages totaling more than $530,000, which contained a forged signa-
ture of a notary public. Many of the properties that he claimed were located in Kentucky did not 
exist or were actually located in other states, and Daniel did not have any authority to issue mort-
gages on those properties. However, Daniel could not maintain his fraud and was eventually 
caught and prosecuted in federal court. Daniel pleaded guilty to devising a scheme to defraud
investors and to obtain money and property from investors by means of false and fraudulent pre-
tenses, representations, and promises. He was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison and was 
ordered to pay $2,797,000 in restitution for his real estate schemes that resulted in the loss of 
more than $1 million for investors.62 ■
Business’s Responsibility to the Community
As corporate citizens, businesses have a responsibility to the communities in which they operate.
In addition to providing jobs and creating wealth, companies contribute to the local community
in many different ways. Socially responsible businesses are aware of their duty to put back into 
the community some of what they take out as they generate profits; their goal is to become a 
neighbor of choice.
Experts estimate that 80 percent of companies worldwide engage in some type of socially 
responsible activity.63 The following are just a few examples of ways small businesses have found
to give back to their communities:
● Act as volunteers for community groups such as the American Red Cross, United Way,
literacy programs, and community food banks.
● Participate in projects that aid the elderly or economically disadvantaged.
● Adopt a highway near the business to promote a clean community.
● Volunteer in school programs, such as Junior Achievement.
In a recent survey, 92 percent of consumers say that given the opportunity, they would buy 
products with a social and/or environmental benefit.64 Even small companies that may be short 
on funding can support causes by choosing them strategically and discovering creative ways to 
help them. The key to choosing the “right” cause is finding one that makes an impact and whose

purpose resonates with customers, employees, and owners. Small companies can commit their 
employees’ talent and know-how, not just dollars, to carefully chosen social causes and then tell
the world about their cause and their dedication to serving it. By forging meaningful partnerships, 
both the businesses and the causes benefit in unique ways. Over the years, companies have helped 
social causes enjoy financial rewards and unprecedented support. In addition to doing good, com-
panies have been able to enhance their reputations, deepen employee loyalty, strengthen ties with 
business partners, and sell more products or services.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Melissa Rich: Inter-r
Schola Melissa Rich started her social enterprise, Inter-
Schola, based on a conversation she had about what schools do 
with old equipment and other materials. After doing some re-
search, she discovered that there was an opportunity to help 
schools transform unwanted assets and other materials into cash 
by selling them on eBay. She keeps about 35 percent of the sales’
proceeds, and the school gets the rest. For example, InterSchola 
recently sold five pianos, a vending machine, and a 35–year-old 
school bus for the Lemon Grove School District in California. The
school received $2,400 in cash and helped clean out some badly 
needed storage space. “We’ve tried to do our own auctions in-
house, but it was pretty rinky dink,” said Bret Felix, projects and
facilities supervisor for the school district. “InterSchola has been
at it long enough they know how to do it with eBay and get the 
word out to so many more potential buyers.” Since the launch of 
the business in 2004, InterSchola has sold more than $15 million 
in materials, providing schools with approximately $10 million in
badly needed cash.65 ■
Entrepreneurs such as InterSchola who demonstrate their sense of social responsibility not 
only make their communities better places to live and work but also stand out from their com-
petitors. Their efforts to operate ethical, socially responsible businesses create a strong sense of 
loyalty among their customers and their employees.
Conclusion
Businesses must do more than merely earn profits; they must act ethically and in a socially respon-
sible manner. Establishing and maintaining high ethical and socially responsible standards must 
be a top concern of every business owner. Managing in an ethical and socially responsible manner 
presents a tremendous challenge, however. There is no universal definition of ethical behavior, 
and what is considered ethical may change over time and may be different in other cultures.
Finally, business owners and managers must recognize the key role they play in influencing 
their employees’ ethical and socially responsible behavior. What owners and managers say is
important, but what they do is even more important! Employees in a small company look to the 
owner and managers as models; therefore, owners and managers must commit themselves to 
following the highest ethical standards if they expect their employees to do so.
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Define business ethics and describe the 
three levels of ethical standards.
●Business ethics involves the fundamental moral 
values and behavioral standards that form the foun-
dation for the people of an organization as they
make decisions and interact with organizational
stakeholders. Small business managers must con-
sider the ethical and social as well as the economic 
implications of their decisions.
●The three levels of ethical standards are (1) the law, 
(2) the policies and procedures of the company, and
(3) the moral stance of the individual.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
●Social entrepreneurs use entrepreneurship to pursue 
opportunities to create social value by creating inno-
vative solutions to society’s most vexing problems.
5. Define social responsibility.
●Social responsibility is the awareness of a company’s
managers of the social, environmental, political, 
human, and financial consequences of their actions.
6. Understand the nature of business’s
responsibility to the environment.
●Environmentally responsible business owners focus
on the three Rs: reduce the amount of materials 
used in the company from the factory floor to the 
copier room, reuse whatever you can, and recycle
the materials you must dispose of.
7. Describe business’s responsibility 
to employees.
●Companies have a duty to act responsibly toward one
of their most important stakeholders: their employees. 
Businesses must recognize and manage the cultural
diversity that exists in the workplace, establish a re-
sponsible strategy for combating substance abuse in
the workplace (including drug testing), prevent sexual
harassment, and respect employees’ right to privacy.
8. Explain business’s responsibility to customers.
●Every company’s customers have a right to safe 
products and services; to honest, accurate informa-
tion; to be heard; to education about products and 
services; and to choices in the marketplace.
9. Discuss business’s responsibility to investors.
●Companies have the responsibility to provide 
investors with an attractive return on their invest-
ments and to report their financial performances in
an accurate and timely fashion to their investors.
10. Describe business’s responsibility to the 
community.
●Increasingly, companies are seeing a need to go be-
yond “doing well” to “doing good”—being socially
responsible community citizens. In addition to provid-
ing jobs and creating wealth, companies contribute to 
the local community in many different ways.
2. Determine who is responsible for ethical 
behavior and why ethical lapses occur.
●Managers set the moral tone of the organization. There 
are three ethical styles of management: immoral, 
amoral, and moral. Although moral management has 
value in itself, companies that operate with this phi-
losophy discover other benefits, including a positive 
reputation among customers and employees.
●Ethical lapses occur for a variety of reasons:
Some people are corrupt (“the bad apple”).
The company culture has been poisoned 
(“the bad barrel”).
Competitive pressures push managers to compromise.
Managers are tempted by an opportunity to 
“get ahead.”
Managers in different cultures have different views 
of what is ethical.
3. Explain how to establish and maintain high 
ethical standards.
●Philosophers throughout history have developed vari-
ous tests of ethical behavior: the utilitarian principle, 
Kant’s categorical imperative, the professional ethic, 
the Golden Rule, the television test, and the family test.
●A small business manager can maintain high ethical 
standards in the following ways:
Create a company credo.
Develop a code of ethics.
Enforce the code fairly and consistently.
Hire the right people.
Conduct ethical training.
Perform periodic ethical audits.
Establish high standards of behavior, not just rules.
Set an impeccable ethical example at all times.
Create a culture emphasizing two-way 
communication.
Involve employees in establishing ethical standards.
4. Explain the difference between social 
entrepreneurs and traditional entrepreneurs.
●Traditional entrepreneurs seek opportunities to 
create market value and profit.

Mind: From Ideas to Reality

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY 
97
One of the tenets of entrepreneurship is the ability to create new and useful ideas that solve the 
problems and challenges people face every day. Entrepreneurs achieve success by creating value 
in the marketplace when they combine resources in new and different ways to gain a competitive 
edge over rivals. From Alexander Fleming’s pioneering work that resulted in a cure for infections
(penicillin) and the founders of the Rocket Chemical Company’s fortieth try to create an industrial
lubricant (WD-40) to Jeff Bezos’s innovative use of the Internet in retailing (Amazon.com) and
Ted Turner’s around-the-clock approach to the availability of television news (CNN), entrepre-
neurs’ ideas have transformed the world.
As you learned in Chapter 1, entrepreneurs can create value in a number of ways—inventing 
new products and services, developing new technology, discovering new knowledge, improving 
existing products or services, finding different ways of providing more goods and services with 
fewer resources, and many others. Indeed, finding new ways of satisfying customers’ needs, 
inventing new products and services, putting together existing ideas in new and different ways, 
and creating new twists on existing products and services are hallmarks of the entrepreneur!
Since Earl Dickson invented the Band-aid in 1920 for his wife, who experienced frequent 
cuts while preparing food, entrepreneurs have been working to improve the simple but effective
invention. Tsai Cheng-Yu and Hsu Hao-Ming, two students at Shih Chien University in Taiwan,
created the AmoeBAND, a Band-aid with cut-away sections that allow it to be adjusted to fit the 
location of the wound so that it stays on and a sensor that alerts the wearer if the wound becomes 
infected. Inventors at the European Center of Innovative Textiles in Lille, France, have devel-
oped a new fabric for use in dressing wounds that incorporates antiviral, antibacterial, and other 
medicines into the fibers. They also are experimenting with nonwoven textiles that serve as seeds 
for rebuilding human tissue. Jeff Skiba, a former medical consultant and founder of Vomaris 
Innovations, won approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an adhesive ban-
dage called Procellera that is equipped with microscopic batteries that pass a small amount of 
electrical current (just 1.2 volts) over the injured area to accelerate the healing process.1 Like 
many innovators, these entrepreneurs have achieved success by taking a common item, bandages, 
that had existed for many years and looking at it in a different way.
Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship
According to the Battelle R&D Magazine, U.S. companies, government agencies, and universities 
invest more than $465 billion annually in research and development (R&D).2 Small companies
are an important part of the total R&D picture. One study by the Small Business Administration 
reports that small companies produce 16 times more patents per employee than their larger rivals. 
What is the entrepreneurial “secret” for creating value in the marketplace? In reality, the “secret”
is no secret at all: It is applying creativity and innovation to solve problems and to exploit oppor-
tunities that people face every day. Creativity is the ability to develop new ideas and to discover 
new ways of looking at problems and opportunities. Innovation is the ability to apply creative 
solutions to those problems and opportunities to enhance or enrich people’s lives. Harvard’s Ted 
Levitt says creativity is thinking new things and innovation is doing new things. In short, entre-
preneurs succeed by thinking and doing new things or old things in new ways. Simply having 
a great new idea is not enough; transforming the idea into a tangible product, service, or busi-
ness venture is the essential next step. “Big ideas are just that—ideas—until you execute,” says 
Krisztina Holly, an entrepreneur who serves on the National Advisory Council for Innovation and 
Entrepreneurship.3
Successful entrepreneurs develop new ideas, products, and services that solve a problem 
or fill a need and, in doing so, create value for their customers and wealth for themselves. As 
management legend Peter Drucker said, “Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurs, 
the act that endows resources with a new capacity to create wealth.”4 In a world that is changing 
faster than most of us ever could have imagined, creativity and innovation are vital to a company’s 
success—and ultimate survival. That’s true for businesses in every industry—from automakers to 
tea growers—and for companies of all sizes. A recent survey by Adobe of people in the world’s 
five largest economies reports that 80 percent of people believe unlocking creative potential is 
the key to economic and societal growth, yet only one in four people say they are living up to 
their creative potential. In addition, the survey reveals a creativity gap, in which 75 percent of

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
respondents say they are under increasing pressure to be productive rather than creative; yet just 
25 percent of their work time is devoted to creativity. The primary barrier to creativity on the job?
Lack of time. In addition, 59 percent of the survey’s respondents say their educational systems
stifle individual creativity.5
Although big businesses develop many new ideas, creativity and innovation are the signa-
tures of small, entrepreneurial businesses. Creative thinking has become a core business skill,
and entrepreneurs lead the way in developing and applying that skill. In fact, creativity and 
innovation often lie at the heart of small companies’ ability to compete successfully with their 
larger rivals. Even though they cannot outspend their larger rivals, small companies can create 
powerful, effective competitive advantages over big companies by “out-creating” and “out-
innovating” them! If they fail to do so, entrepreneurs don’t stay in business very long. Leadership 
expert Warren Bennis says, “Today’s successful companies live and die according to the quality
of their ideas.”6
Some small businesses create innovations reactively in response to customer feedback or 
changing market conditions, and others create innovations proactively, spotting opportunities on
which to capitalize. Sometimes innovation is revolutionary, creating market-changing, disruptive 
breakthroughs that are the result of generating something from nothing. More often, innovation is
evolutionary, developing market-sustaining ideas that elaborate on existing products, processes,
and services that result from putting old things together in new ways or from taking something 
away to create something simpler or better. Apple did not invent the digital music player, but 
Steve Jobs’s company created a player that was easier to use and offered a “cool” factor that 
existing MP3 players did not have. One experimenter’s research to improve the adhesive on tape 
resulted in a glue that hardly stuck at all. Although most researchers might have considered the 
experiment a total failure and scrapped it, this researcher asked a simple, creative question: What 
can you do with a glue when you take away most of its stickiness? The answer led to the inven-
tion of one of the most popular office products of all time: the Post-It note, a product that now 
includes more than 4,000 variations.
Entrepreneurial innovation encompasses not only new products and services but also new
business models. As graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, cofounders of Google, real-
ized that the Internet’s ocean of information had outpaced people’s ability to locate the informa-
tion they wanted with existing search engines. Convinced that Internet users would value more 
relevant search results, the entrepreneurs developed a new service, Google’s PageRank system,
an algorithm that screens Internet searches and organizes them to produce the most relevant 
results. As traffic on their search engine grew, the young entrepreneurs created a new business 
model that involved selling advertising space (paid listings) by auctioning to businesses key 
words that visitors used in their searches. Today, their innovative business model accounts for 
91 percent of Google’s revenue (nearly $51 billion annually), and Google dominates the search 
engine market with 68 percent of all searches conducted.7
Some entrepreneurs stumble onto their ideas by accident but are clever enough to spot the 
business opportunities they offer.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Brian Levin: Perky Jerky Serial entrepreneur Brian Levin,
who created the first text-message voting system (the one used on American Idol), and a
friend were on a chairlift on the snowy slopes in Snowbird, Utah, one morning when Levin
reached into his backpack for a package of beef jerky. Unfortunately, an energy drink had spilled
onto the package, soaking the jerky, but Levin and his friend were hungry and ate it anyway. As 
they skied down the mountain, the duo experienced an energy boost. The jerky, now quite ten-
der because of its soaking, had taken on the characteristics of the energy drink but had retained
its peppery flavor. Inspired, Levin spent the next two years working with a food laboratory to 
refine a process for making an energy-boosting jerky around which he built a company to mar-
ket the new product, which he named Perky Jerky. The company now generates annual sales of 
$10 million.8 ■
More often, creative ideas arise when entrepreneurs look at something old and think some-
thing new or different. Legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, whose teams
dominated college football in the 1920s, got the idea for his constantly shifting backfields 
while watching a burlesque chorus routine! Rockne’s innovations in the backfield (which

included the legendary “Four Horsemen”) and his emphasis on the forward 
pass (a legal but largely unused tactic in this era) so befuddled opposing 
defenses that his teams compiled an impressive 105-12-5 record.9
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Brian Spaly: Trunk Club Brian 
Spaly, who cofounded pants retailer Bonobos while in college, re-
cently became CEO of Trunk Club, a Chicago-based company that has 
taken the concept of a personal shopper that many upscale department 
stores provide for their best clients and moved it online. Fashion-
challenged men around the world who need to dress well but do not
enjoy shopping can go to the Trunk Club Web site and join for free. After 
answering some basic questions about their sizes and fashion prefer-
ences, they gain access to a personal shopper, who handles all of their 
clothing purchases and ships various items in a trunk at the customer’s
request. The typical trunk includes 6 to 10 items from companies such as 
Gant, Ben Sherman, Jack Spade, Barbour, Bonobos, and others that in-
clude items ranging from outerwear and shoes to suits and jeans, all 
based on the customer’s individual preferences and style. The average
price is $150 per item, and customers need only to text or e-mail their 
personal shoppers with a “send trunk” message to receive a trunk. Trunk 
Club pays all shipping costs (both ways), and customers pay only for the items they keep. The typi-
cal Trunk Club member, a professional man between the ages of 25 and 50 with an annual income
that exceeds $100,000, keeps one-third of the items his personal shopper ships. “The apparel busi-
ness is an area where there’s a lot of room for innovation,” says Spaly. Trunk Club recently landed
an $11 million Round A investment led by venture capital firm U.S. Venture Partners and is on 
track to generate annual sales of $45 million.10 ■
Entrepreneurship is the result of a disciplined, systematic process of applying creativity and 
innovation to needs and opportunities in the marketplace. It involves applying focused strategies 
to new ideas and new insights to create a product or a service that satisfies customers’ needs
or solves their problems. It is much more than random, disjointed tinkering with a new gadget. 
Millions of people come up with creative ideas for new or different products and services; most 
of them, however, never do anything with them. Entrepreneurs are people who connect their 
creative ideas with the purposeful action and structure of a business. Thus, successful entre-
preneurship is a constant process that relies on creativity, innovation, and application in the 
marketplace.
Innovation must be a constant process because most ideas don’t work and most innova-
tions fail. One writer explains, “Trial—and lots of error—is embedded in entrepreneurship.”11
For every 5,000 to 10,000 new drug discoveries, only about 250 get to preclinical trials, and 
only 5 of those make it to clinical trials. Just one or two drugs emerge from clinical trials for 
review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and only one typically gets to the market in 
a process that typically takes 10 to 15 years.12 New products are crucial to companies’ success,
however. According to Robert Cooper, a researcher who has analyzed thousands of new prod-
uct launches, new products (those launched within the previous three years) account for an 
impressive 38 percent of sales at top-performing companies.13 Still, successful entrepreneurs 
recognize that many failures will accompany innovations, and they are willing to accept their 
share of failures because they know that failure is merely part of the creative process. Rather 
than quit when they fail, entrepreneurs simply keep trying. While working as a textbook editor, 
James Michener had an idea for a book based on his experiences in the Solomon Islands during 
World War II. He sent the manuscript to a publisher and received the following note: “You are 
a good editor. Don’t throw it all away trying to be a writer. I read your book. Frankly, it’s not 
really that good.” Michener persisted and went on to publish South Pacific, for which he won 
a Pulitzer Prize and which became the basis for one of Broadway’s most successful musicals
of all time.14
Entrepreneurship requires business owners to be bold enough to try their new ideas, flexible 
enough to throw aside those that do not work, and wise enough to learn about what will work 
based on their observations of what did not. We now turn our attention to creativity, the creative 
process, and methods of enhancing creativity.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Creativity—Essential to Survival
In this fiercely competitive, fast-faced, global economy, creativity is not only an important source for 
building a competitive advantage but also a necessity for survival. When developing creative solu-
tions to modern problems, entrepreneurs must go beyond merely relying on what has worked in the 
past. “The alternatives are to ‘make change’ or ‘be changed,’” says Langdon Morris, cofounder of 
InnovationLabs and an expert on innovation. “Making change brings considerable advantages, but 
being changed carries a huge load of negative consequences. The choice isn’t really a choice at all. 
You’ve got to pursue innovation, and you’ve got to do it to obtain long lasting benefits.”15 Compa-
nies that fail to become engines of innovation are more likely to lose ground to their more creative
competitors and ultimately become irrelevant and close their doors. Transforming their organizations
into engines of innovation requires entrepreneurs to cast off the limiting assumptions, beliefs, and 
behaviors and to develop new insights into the relationship among resources, needs, and value. In 
other words, they must change their perspectives, looking at the world in new and different ways.
Entrepreneurs must always be on guard against traditional assumptions and perspectives about 
how things ought to be because they are certain killers of creativity. Such self-imposed mental con-
straints that people tend to build over time push creativity right out the door. These ideas become so
deeply rooted in our minds that they become immovable blocks to creative thinking—even though
they may be outdated, obsolete, and no longer relevant. In short, they act as logjams to creativity.
That’s why children are so creative and curious about new possibilities; society has not yet brain-
washed them into an attitude of conformity, nor have they learned to accept traditional solutions as
l
the only solutions. By retaining their creative “inner child,” entrepreneurs are able to throw off the
y
shackles on creativity and see opportunities for creating viable businesses where most people see what 
they’ve always seen (or, worse yet, see nothing). Creative exercises, such as the one in Figure 3.1, can
help adults reconnect with the creativity they exhibited so readily as children.

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
101
Many years ago, during an international chess competition, Frank Marshall made what has
become known as one of the most beautiful—and one of the most creative—moves ever made on 
a chess board. In a crucial game in which he was evenly matched with a Russian master player,
Marshall found his queen under serious attack. Marshall had several avenues of escape for his queen
available. Knowing that the queen is one of the most important offensive players on the chessboard, 
spectators assumed that Marshall would make a conventional move and push his queen to safety.
Using all the time available to him to consider his options, Marshall picked up his queen—
and paused—and put it down on the most illogical square of all—a square from which the queen
l
could easily be captured by any one of three hostile pieces. Marshall had done the unthinkable! 
He had sacrificed his queen, a move typically made only under the most desperate of circum-
stances. All the spectators—even Marshall’s opponent—groaned in dismay. Then the Russian 
(and finally the crowd) realized that Marshall’s move was, in reality, a brilliant one. No matter 
how the Russian opponent took the queen, he would eventually be in a losing position. Seeing the
inevitable outcome, the Russian conceded the game. Marshall had won the match in a rare and 
daring fashion: he had won by sacrificing his queen!16
What lesson does this story hold for entrepreneurs? By suspending conventional thinking 
long enough to even consider the possibility of such a move, Marshall was able to throw off the 
usual assumptions constraining most chess players. He had looked beyond the traditional and 
orthodox strategies of the game and was willing to take the risk of trying an unusual tactic to win. 
The result: He won. Although not every creative business opportunity entrepreneurs take will be 
successful, many who, like Frank Marshall, are willing to go beyond conventional wisdom will 
be rewarded for their efforts. Successful entrepreneurs, those who are constantly pushing tech-
nological and economic boundaries forward, constantly ask, “Is it time to sacrifice the queen?”
Merely generating one successful creative solution to address a problem or a need usually 
is not good enough to keep an entrepreneurial enterprise successful in the long run, however. 
Success—even survival—in the modern world of business requires entrepreneurs to tap their 
creativity (and that of their employees) constantly. Entrepreneurs can be sure that if they have 
developed a unique, creative solution to solve a problem or to fill a need, a competitor (perhaps 
one six times zones away) is hard at work developing an even more creative solution to render 
theirs obsolete. This extremely rapid and accelerating rate of change has created an environment 
in which staying in a leadership position requires constant creativity, innovation, and entrepre-
neurship. A company that has achieved a leadership position in an industry but then stands still
creatively is soon toppled from its number one perch.
Can Creativity Be Taught?
For many years, conventional wisdom held that a person was either creative—imaginative, 
free-spirited, entrepreneurial—or not—logical, narrow-minded, rigid. Today, we know better. 
Research shows that anyone can learn to be creative. “Every person can be taught techniques and 
behaviors that help them generate more ideas,” says Joyce Wycoff, author of several books on 
creativity.17 The problem is that in most organizations, employees have never been expected to 
be creative. In addition, many businesses fail to foster an environment that encourages creativ-
ity among employees. Restricted by their traditional thinking patterns, most people never tap 
into their pools of innate creativity, and the company becomes stagnant. Innovation produces a 
distinct competitive advantage for a company, empowers employees, and leads to higher levels 
of job satisfaction.
Not only can entrepreneurs and the people who work for them learn to think creatively, but 
they must for their companies’ sake! “Innovation and creativity are not just for artists,” says
Wycoff. “These are skills with a direct, bottom-line payoff.”18 Before entrepreneurs can draw on
their own creative capacity or stimulate creativity in their own organizations, they must under-
stand creative thinking.
Creative Thinking
Research into the operation of the human brain shows that each hemisphere of the brain pro-
cesses information differently and that one side of the brain tends to be dominant over the other. 
The human brain develops asymmetrically, and each hemisphere tends to specialize in certain

functions. The left brain is guided by linear, vertical thinking (from one logical conclusion to the 
next), whereas the right brain relies on kaleidoscopic, lateral thinking (considering a problem 
from all sides and jumping into it at different points). The left brain handles language, logic, 
and symbols; the right brain takes care of the body’s emotional, intuitive, and spatial functions.
The left brain processes information in a step-by-step fashion, but the right brain processes it 
intuitively—all at once, relying heavily on images.
Left-brain vertical thinking is narrowly focused and systematic, proceeding in a highly logi-
cal fashion from one point to the next. Right-brain lateral thinking, on the other hand, is some-
what unconventional, unsystematic, and unstructured, much like the image of a kaleidoscope, 
whirling around to form one pattern after another. It is this right brain–driven, lateral thinking 
that lies at the heart of the creative process. Those who have learned to develop their right-brain 
thinking skills tend to do the following:
● Always ask the question, “Is there a better way?”
● Challenge custom, routine, and tradition.
● Be reflective, often staring out windows, deep in thought. (How many traditional managers 
would stifle creativity by snapping these people out of their “daydreams,” chastise them for 
“loafing,” and admonish them to “get back to work”?)
● Be prolific thinkers. They know that generating lots of ideas increases the likelihood of 
coming up with a few highly creative ideas.
● Play mental games, trying to see an issue from different perspectives.
● Realize that there may be more than one “right answer.”
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Anna Haupt and Terese
Alstin: Hövding Anna Haupt and Terese Alstin, both students at 
Sweden’s Lund University, recognized that many people incurred serious
head injuries from bicycle accidents that they could have avoided if they 
had been wearing bicycle helmets. Their research showed that many peo-
ple do not like to wear helmets because they are uncomfortable and don’t 
look cool. The entrepreneurs believed that there was more than one solu-
tion to the bicycle helmet problem and created the Hövding Invisible Bike 
Helmet, which really is not a helmet at all but a collar that contains an 
airbag shaped like a hood. The invisible helmet uses rechargeable battery-
powered accelerometers and gyroscopes that detect the motions involved
in a bike crash and trigger a tiny gas inflator that fills a nylon airbag with 
helium in 0.1 seconds, protecting the cyclist’s head from impact. Their
company, Hövding, already has raised $13 million in venture capital and 
has 16 employees.19 ■

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: David Williams: Comfe Designs
David Williams’s idea came to him while he was reading a book
that rested uncomfortably in his hands. He realized that tablet users
faced the same problem and developed Comfe Hands, two soft PVC 
corners that fit on the corners of a tablet, giving it a shape that fits the 
human hand more naturally. Williams designed his first prototype that 
weekend, creating it out of a piece of scrap cardboard. After testing his 
prototypes on actual tablet users and receiving positive feedback, Williams launched Comfe
Designs as a part-time business. When his job was eliminated, which he says is the best
thing that ever happened to him, Williams made Comfe Designs a full-time business. 
Williams’s company is working on designs to improve the performance of other devices, 
including smartphones, sound systems, and television monitors. The company’s strategy is

to identify problems with existing products and to create a solution that improves custom-
ers’ interaction with that product.20 ■
● Understand that failure is a natural part of the creative process. James Dyson spent 15 years 
and nearly his entire savings before he succeeded in developing the bagless vacuum cleaner 
that made him rich and famous. To discover something truly new, Dyson says, one must 
make mistakes because success teaches very few lessons.
● Have “helicopter skills,” the ability to rise above the daily routine to see an issue 
from a broader perspective and then swoop back down to focus on an area in need of 
change.
● Relate seemingly unrelated ideas to a problem to generate innovative solutions.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Charles Kaman: Kaman Aircraft Company and
Ovation Instruments After graduating from college, Charles Kaman worked in the
helicopter division of United Aircraft Corporation, where he helped to design helicopters for 
the military. Using a homemade calculator he called the Aeronalyzer, Kaman developed several 
innovations in rotor and wing designs, in none of which his employer showed any interest. In
1945, with $2,000 and his idea for a new dual rotor system that made helicopters more stable 
and safer to fly, 26-year-old Kaman, also an accomplished guitarist, turned down an offer to
join Tommy Dorsey’s famous swing band and decided to pursue his innovative designs for heli-
copters. He started the Kaman Aircraft Company in his mother’s garage. Over the next 50 years, 
Kaman built his company into a billion-dollar aviation business, creating many important 
innovations along the way, including turbine engines, blades made of lightweight, sturdy com-
posite materials, and remote-controlled helicopters. Kaman also maintained an avid interest in 
guitars and in 1964 began working with a small team of aerospace engineers to build a better 
acoustic guitar. Drawing on their experience of removing vibrations from helicopters, the team 
reverse-engineered a guitar with a bowl-shaped body made of composite materials that incor-
porated more vibration into the instrument, giving it a bolder, richer sound. “In helicopters,
engineers spend all of their time trying to figure out how to remove vibration,” Kaman said. 
“To build a guitar, you spend your time trying to figure out how to put vibration in.” Kaman 
founded Ovation Instruments in 1966 and began selling the Balladeer, an acoustical guitar that
immediately attracted attention for its superior tone and volume among musicians, including 
famous artists such as John Lennon, Glen Campbell, Bob Marley, Carly Simon, Jimmy Page, and 
Melissa Etheridge.21 ■
Although each hemisphere of the brain tends to dominate in its particular functions, the two 
halves normally cooperate, with each part contributing its special abilities to accomplish those 
tasks best suited to its mode of information processing. Sometimes, however, the two hemi-
spheres may even compete with each other, or one half may choose not to participate. Some 
researchers have suggested that each half of the brain has the capacity to keep information from 
the other! The result, literally, is that “the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing.” 
Perhaps the most important characteristic of this split-brain phenomenon is that an individual can 
learn to control which side of the brain is dominant in a given situation. In other words, a person 
can learn to “turn down” the dominant left hemisphere (focusing on logic and linear thinking) 
and “turn up” the right hemisphere (focusing on intuition and unstructured thinking) when a situ-
ation requiring creativity arises.22 To get a little practice at this “shift,” try the visual exercises 
presented in Figure 3.2. When viewed from one perspective, the picture B on the right portrays 
an attractive young lady with a feather in her hair and a boa around her shoulders. Once you shift 
your perspective, however, you will see an old woman with a large nose wearing a scarf on her 
head! This change in the image seen is the result of a shift from one hemisphere in the viewer’s 
brain to the other. With practice, a person can learn to control this mental shift, tapping the pool 
of creativity that lies hidden within the right side of the brain. This ability has tremendous power 
to unleash the creative capacity of entrepreneurs. The need to develop this creative ability means 
that exploring inner space (the space within our brains)—not outer space—becomes the chal-
lenge of the century.

104
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Successful entrepreneurship requires both left- and right-brain thinking. Right-brain think-
ing draws on the power of divergent reasoning, which is the ability to create a multitude of 
original, diverse ideas. Left-brain thinking counts on convergent reasoning, the ability to evaluate 
multiple ideas and choose the best solution to a given problem. Entrepreneurs need to rely on 
right-brain thinking to generate innovative product, service, or business ideas. Then they must 
use left-brain thinking to judge the market potential of the ideas they generate. Successful en-
trepreneurs have learned to coordinate the complementary functions of each hemisphere of the
brain, using their brains’ full creative power to produce pragmatic innovation. Otherwise, entre-
preneurs, who rarely can be accused of being “halfhearted” about their business ideas, run the
risk of becoming “halfheaded.”
How can entrepreneurs learn to tap their innate creativity more readily? The first step is to 
break down the barriers to creativity that most of us have erected over the years. We now turn our 
attention to these barriers and some suggested techniques for tearing them down.
Barriers to Creativity
The number of potential barriers to creativity is virtually limitless—time pressures, unsupport-
ive management, pessimistic coworkers, overly rigid company policies, and countless others. 
Perhaps the most difficult hurdles to overcome, however, are those that individuals impose on 
themselves. In his book A Whack on the Side of the Head, Roger von Oech identifies 10 “mental 
locks” that limit individual creativity:23
1. Searching for the one “right” answer. Recent research by Kyung Hee Kim, a professor 
at the College of William & Mary, shows that creativity (as measured by the Torrance 
Test of Creative Thinking) among both children and adults in the United States has de-
clined markedly since 1990. The decline, which Kim says is “very significant,” is particu-
larly acute among the youngest segment of the population, children from kindergarten to

Creativity expert Teresa Amabile identifies three components of
creativity: (1) Expertise. One must have the technical, procedural,
and conceptual knowledge to generate potential solutions to a 
problem. (2) Creative thinking skills. A person must possess the
willingness to take risks and to see problems or situations from
different perspectives, using many of the techniques described in 
this chapter. (3) Motivation. One must have the internal desire to 
develop creative solutions. This motivation often comes from the 
challenge that the work itself presents.
Entrepreneurs and their employees can transform their 
companies into engines of innovation by combining these three 
components of creativity with what management consultant The
Doblin Group calls the 10 types of innovation.
1. Business model. How does your company make money? 
These are innovations in the value proposition that a com-
pany provides its target customers and in the way it delivers 
value to its customers.
2. Networks and alliances. Can you join forces with another 
company or entity for mutual benefit? A company may 
forge a synergistic relationship with another organization 
in which each company’s strengths complement the other.
3. Organizational structure. How do you support and 
encourage your employees’ creative efforts? The most 
effective organizations use an appropriate structure and 
culture to align their talent to spark innovation.
4. Core process. How does your company create and add 
value for customers? These innovations in a company’s
internal processes result in superior business systems and 
work methods that result in benefits for customers.
5. Product or service performance. What are the most im-
portant features and functions of your company’s products 
or services? Innovations in functions and features can give a 
company’s product or service a significant edge over those 
of competitors.
6. Product system. Can you link multiple products into a system
or a platform? Bundling products can add value for customers.
7. Service. How do you provide value-added service beyond 
your company’s products for customers? Some of the most 
successful businesses set themselves apart from their 
competition by providing unparalleled customer service.
8. Channel. How do you get your products or services into 
customers’ hands? Some companies provide extra value 
to their customers by making their products and services 
available in many venues.
9. Brand. What is your company’s “identity” in the market-
place? Successful companies use creative advertising, 
promotion, and marketing techniques to build a desirable 
brand identity with customers.
10. Customer experience. Does your company engage cus-
tomers and give them reasons to come back to make future
purchases? Innovative companies find ways to connect 
with their customers, creating a loyal base of “fansumers,” 
customers who not only purchase but act like fans who pro-
mote the company to their friends and family members.
Boatbound
Serial entrepreneur Aaron Hall took note of the “sharing economy” 
that emerged during the last recession and launched Boatbound, a 
peer-to-peer boat rental company that brings together boat owners 
who are willing to rent their boats when they are not in use and 
people who want a fun boating experience without the cost of
owning a boat. Hall realized that 12.2 million boats are registered 
in the United States, yet the average owner uses his or her boat just 
26 days per year. Boatbound screens all potential renters, verifies 
the condition and the safety of each boat, carries ample insurance
on each boat, and covers general liability. Boat owners select their 
renters from Boatbound’s pool of applicants and set daily rental fees, 
and Boatbound collects 35 percent of the fee. Boatbound has rented
every kind of boat, from kayaks to yachts with captains. Fees range
from $200 to $8,500 per day. “As a boat owner and someone in the
marine industry, I’ve been waiting for something like this my whole
life,” says Aabad Melwani, owner of a marina. “I just didn’t know it.”
Henrybuilt
Scott Hudson, CEO of Henrybuilt, had created a profitable 
niche designing and building upscale kitchens that ranged from 
$30,000 to $100,000. In 2006, Hudson opened a New York City 
showroom, which doubled in size in just 18 months. By 2008, 
the company had more than 200 jobs in the United States, 
Mexico, and Canada. When the recession hit, however, new 
projects came to a standstill, and customers began cancelling or-
ders. In response, Hudson launched a subsidiary, Viola Park Corpo-
ration, that provides customers lower-cost remodeling options that
use its software rather than an architect to create “custom” varia-
tions on Henrybuilt designs. The result is a process that produces
a kitchen much faster and at half the cost of a Henrybuilt kitchen.
Henrybuilt sales have recovered, but Viola Park accounts for 
20 percent of sales and is growing twice as fast as Henrybuilt.
Unequal Technologies
Robert Vito started Unequal Technologies in 2008 to supply protec-
tive clothing and gear, including bullet-proof vests, to military con-
tractors. The protective gear is made from a lightweight yet strong 
composite material that he developed and patented. Two years later, 
the equipment manager of the Philadelphia Eagles called to ask 
whether Unequal Technologies could create a special garment for 
one of its star players who had suffered a sternum injury. Vito modi-
fied the bullet-proof vest for the player and soon had other players 
in the National Football League asking for protective gear. Unequal 
technologies went on to develop Concussion Reduction Technology
(CRT), peel-and-stick pads for football helmets that are made from

the composite and that absorb and disperse the force of an impact 
before it reaches the skull. Independent tests show that CRT reduces 
the risk of head injuries from impact by 53 percent. The company
now supplies equipment to 27 of the NFL’s 32 teams and has its sights 
set on an even larger market: amateur sports. Vito says Unequal’s 
technology gives the company a competitive edge that has allowed it 
to increase sales from $1 million to $20 million in just one year.

sixth grade.24 Part of the problem is that deeply ingrained in most educational systems is 
the assumption that there is one “right” answer to a problem. In reality, however, most 
problems are ambiguous. The average student who has completed four years of college
has taken more than 2,600 tests; therefore, it is not unusual for this one-correct-answer 
syndrome to become an inherent part of our thinking. Although everyone has the capac-
ity to be creative, not everyone develops that capacity. Most education systems do not 
do much to encourage creativity among students; instead, they promote uniformity and
standardization. People who go through many years of schooling often come out on the
other side drained of their creative potential and focused on conformity rather than on
creativity.
Depending on the questions one asks, there may be (and usually are) several “right” 
answers.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jason Lucash and Mike
Szymczak: OrigAudio Jason Lucash and Mike Szymczak 
grew tired of hauling bulky audio players as part of their jobs 
with JanSport, a maker of sports, travel, business, and tote bags, 
and began experimenting with designs for pop-up speakers. 
(Their early experiments involved putting speakers into Chinese 
food takeout boxes.) With $10,000 in seed money from Lucash’s
mother, the entrepreneurs launched OrigAudio (a mash-up of 
“origami” and “audio”) and introduced their first product:
speakers made from recycled material that come flat and fold
together. “The Chinese takeout box concept inspired us,” says 
Lucash, “but origami is what empowered us.” Sales took off 
quickly, and Lucash and Szymczak left their jobs to manage 
OrigAudio full time.  OrigAudio now has 14 employees and gen-
erates $4 million in annual sales from nine products, including 
the Rock-It, a small, simple device that turns almost anything—a
cooler, a cup, a bowl, a box, a painting, a lampshade—into a 
speaker.25 ■
2. Focusing on “being logical.” Logic is a valuable part of the creative process, especially
when evaluating ideas and implementing them. However, in the early imaginative phases 
of the process, logical thinking can restrict creativity. Focusing too much effort on being 
logical also discourages the use of one of the mind’s most powerful creations: intuition. 
Von Oech advises us to “think something different” and to use nonlogical thinking freely, 
especially in the imaginative phase of the creative process. Intuition, which is based on 
the accumulated knowledge and experiences a person encounters over the course of a life-
time and which resides in the subconscious, can be unlocked. It is a crucial part of the

creative process because using it often requires one to tear down long-standing assump-
tions that limit creativity and innovation.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Chuck Swoboda: Cree, Inc. Chuck Swoboda, CEO
of Cree, Inc., a lighting manufacturer based in Durham, North Carolina, realized that
the design of the light bulb had remained virtually unchanged in the 130 years since 
Thomas Edison invented it. Cree, founded in 1987, produced highly efficient, long-lasting
LED lights, but LEDs suffer from one problem: They emit light in only one direction, which 
makes them poor substitutes for traditional incandescent and fluorescent bulbs, which
produce omnidirectional light for broad coverage. Designers at the innovative company 
redesigned the traditional filament towers (the heart of a bulb) to include up to 20 small 
LED bulbs of different colors aligned at different (and overlapping) angles that create an 
omnidirectional glow that mimics the light from an incandescent bulb. When Cree made an 
initial public offering in 1993, the company had just 30 employees; today, its workforce
exceeds 6,000.26 ■
3. Blindly following the rules. We learn at a very early age not to “color outside the lines,” 
and we spend the rest of our lives blindly obeying such rules. Sometimes, creativity de-
pends on our ability to break the existing rules so that we can see new ways of doing 
things. “Most people’s minds are not wired to go against what everybody else is doing,”
observes neuroscientist Gregory Berns. “When you look at problems, you tend to perceive 
them in well-worn paths in ways that you’ve perceived them before. That’s the first road-
block in innovating: overcoming your perceptual biases.”27
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: King Gillette: Gillette Safety Razor Company In
1895, King Gillette, a traveling salesman who aspired to be an entrepreneur, was shaving
with a straight razor, the standard technology of the day, when a creative idea struck him: a
“safety razor” that consisted of a small, thin square of sheet steel held in place by a holder
equipped with a handle. When a blade became dull, the user would simply replace it. “I saw it 
all in a moment,” Gillette said. “The way the blade would be held in a holder. Then came the
idea of sharpening the two opposite edges of a thin piece of steel, and then came the clamping 
plates for the blades, with a handle centered between the edges. I stood there in a trance of 
joy.” Gillette visited metallurgists at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who as-
sured him that it would be impossible to produce steel that was thin enough, sharp enough, and 
inexpensive enough to produce blades for his safety razor. After six years of work, however, two 
business associates introduced the determined Gillette to William Nickerson, an MIT graduate
who produced the blade that Gillette had designed. Gillette received patent number 775,134
for his safety razor from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 1904. The American Safety
Razor Company, which later became Gillette Safety Razor Company, began producing blades in
Boston in 1903, and the world of shaving was transformed forever because Gillette was willing 
to question the established “rules” of shaving. Procter and Gamble purchased Gillette in 2005 
for $57 billion.28 ■
4. Constantly being practical. Imagining impractical answers to “what-if” questions can be 
powerful stepping stones to creative ideas. Suspending practicality for a while frees the 
mind to consider creative solutions that otherwise might never arise. Whenever Thomas 
Edison hired an assistant to work in his creative laboratory, he would tell the new em-
ployee to walk through town and list 20 things that interest him. When the worker re-
turned, Edison would ask him to split the list into two columns. Then he would tell the 
employee to randomly combine objects from the two columns to come up with as many 
inventions as he could. Edison’s methods for stimulating creativity in his lab proved to be 
successful; he holds the distinction of being the only person to have earned a patent every 
year for 65 consecutive years!29
Periodically setting aside practicality allows entrepreneurs to consider taking a product 
or a concept from one area and placing it in a totally different application.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Stu Snyder: Cartoon Network PlayWorks, an organi-
zation dedicated to promoting the creative power of play, recently named Stu  Snyder,
CEO of the Cartoon Network, as the Most Playful CEO in the country. Employees are likely to
see Stu riding his oversized tricycle around company headquarters or hear him ring a gong to
celebrate a worker’s or team’s accomplishment, which is followed by cheers and hoots of 
laughter from employees. “I’m a believer of leading by play,” says Snyder. “We’re all team-
mates. Playing, having fun, and laughing together help us enjoy our jobs and improve our
work ethic.” Snyder also recognizes the power of play to unleash people’s creative spirit. 
“Stu’s playful leadership allows employees to be more creative and to take the risk to go full
force with their creative ideas,” says one employee.32 ■
6. Becoming overly specialized. A common killer of creativity is myopic thinking, which 
is narrowly focused and limited by the status quo. Because experts are so immersed in 
what they know, they often are victims of myopic thinking. That’s why creative companies 
include non-experts in creative problem solving or idea generation sessions; they are free 
to ask questions and offer ideas that challenge the status quo and traditional solutions that 
experts “know” cannot work but often do. Creative thinkers tend to be “explorers,” search-
ing for ideas outside their areas of specialty. The idea for the roll-on deodorant stick came 
from the ballpoint pen. The famous Mr. Potato Head toy was invented by a father sitting 
with his family at the dinner table who noted how much fun his children had playing with 
the elderly or the disabled to get fit without having to leave the comfort of their living 
rooms. The GEWOS (the acronym for the German phrase that translates “Healthy Living with 
Style”) chair, which took three-and-a-half years to develop, features armrests that raise to 
reveal rowing handles and built-in sensors that monitor the seated person’s heart rate, blood 
pressure, and oxygen saturation levels. Sensors also indicate whether the user is sitting in the 
proper posture to avoid back injuries. An accompanying tablet includes a virtual fitness as-
sistant that analyzes a user’s data over time and recommends customized exercise plans. 
When not in use as a rowing machine, the chair looks like any other comfortable armchair. 
Early tests with senior citizens indicate that the GEWOS chair is a big hit.30 ■

5. Viewing play as frivolous. A playful attitude is fundamental to cre-
ative thinking. There is a close relationship between the “haha” of 
humor and the “aha” of discovery. Play gives us the opportunity to 
reinvent reality and to reformulate established ways of doing things. 
Children learn when they play, and so can entrepreneurs. Watch
children playing, and you will see them invent new games, create 
new ways of looking at old things, and learn what works (and what 
doesn’t) in their games.
Entrepreneurs can benefit from playing in the same way that 
children do. They, too, can learn to try new approaches and discover 
what works and what doesn’t. Creativity results when entrepreneurs 
take what they have learned at play, evaluate it, corroborate it with 
other knowledge, and put it into practice. Zappos, the online shoe 
retailer that makes regular appearances on Fortune’s Best Places to
Work list, includes “create fun and a little weirdness” as one of its
core values. “Our company culture is what makes us successful,”
says CEO Tony Hsieh. “We want to be able to laugh at ourselves.
We look for both fun and humor in our daily work.”31 Encouraging 
employees to have fun when solving problems means that they are 
more likely to push the boundaries and come up with genuinely 
creative solutions. What kind of invention would Wile E. Coyote, 
who seems to have an inexhaustible supply of ideas for catching the
Roadrunner in those cartoons, create in this situation? How might 
the Three Stooges approach this problem? What would Kramer of 
Seinfeld suggest? What solution would Si from
d
Duck Dynasty of-f
fer? What would a six-year-old do? The idea is to look at a problem 
or situation from different perspectives.

their food. Velcro (a combination of “velvet” and “crochet”) was invented by Swiss engi-
neer Georges de Mestral, who, while hiking one day in 1941 to take a break from work, 
had to stop to peel sticky cockleburs from his clothing. As he picked them off, he noticed 
how their hooked spines caught on and held tightly to the cloth. When he resumed his hike, 
he began to think about the possibilities of using a similar design to fasten objects together.
After eight years of research and work, Mestral perfected his design for Velcro, which he 
patented in 1955.33
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Lynn Perkins, Daisy Downs,
Andrea Barrett, and Hadar Wissotzky: UrbanSitter Late
in 2010, Lynn Perkins, a mother of twin boys and founder of on-
line clothing company Xuny, was having trouble finding a baby-
sitter, a problem that she and many of her friends encountered 
often. She wondered why she could book an online restaurant
reservation so easily, yet had to spend hours sometimes making 
phone calls and sending e-mails to find a babysitter. Perkins knew 
that there had to be a better way and, drawing inspiration from 
the online restaurant booking service OpenTable, convinced
three friends, Daisy Downs, Andrea Barrett, and Hadar Wissotzky, 
to launch UrbanSitter, a San Francisco-based company that uses
Facebook to connect parents and babysitters. Tapping (with per-
mission) into Facebook contacts, groups, and likes, UrbanSitter’s
software identifies potential babysitters and generates a list that 
enables parents to review rates, conduct background checks, 
schedule interviews, and book sitters online. The service also al-
lows parents to see which babysitters their friends have used and 
reviewed, which, Perkins points out, puts parents’ minds at ease 
when bringing in someone for the first time to care for their
children. Just six months after launching UrbanSitter, Perkins and her cofounders ex-
panded the service to New York City, Chicago,

7. Avoiding ambiguity. Ambiguity can be a powerful creative stimulus; it encourages us 
to “think something different.” Being excessively detailed in an imaginative situation
tends to stifle creativity. Ambiguity, however, requires us to consider at least two differ-
ent, often contradictory notions at the same time, which is a direct  channel to creativity. 
Ambiguous situations force us to stretch our minds beyond their normal boundaries and 
to consider creative options we might otherwise ignore. Although ambiguity is not a de-
sired element when entrepreneurs are evaluating and implementing ideas, it is a valuable 
tool when they are searching for creative ideas and solutions. Entrepreneurs are famous 
for asking a question and then going beyond the first answer to explore other possible 
answers. The result is that they often find business opportunities by creating ambiguous 
situations.
8. Fearing looking foolish. Creative thinking is no place for conformity! New ideas rarely are 
born in a conforming environment. People tend toward conformity because they don’t want 
to look foolish. The fool’s job is to whack at the habits and rules that keep us thinking in 
the same old ways. In that sense, entrepreneurs are top-notch “fools.” They are constantly 
questioning and challenging accepted ways of doing things and the assumptions that go 
with them. The noted entrepreneurship theorist Joseph Schumpeter wrote that entrepre-
neurs perform a vital function—“creative destruction”—in which they rethink conventional 
assumptions and discard those that are no longer useful. According to Schumpeter, “The 
function of entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize the pattern of production by exploit-
ing an invention or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing a 
new commodity or producing an old one in a new way, by opening up a new source of 
supply of materials or a new outlet for products, by reorganizing an industry or so on.”35
In short, entrepreneurs look at old ways of doing things and ask, “Is there a better way?” 
By destroying the old, they create the new.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Neurowear: Mico Headphones Neurowear, a com-
pany based in Tokyo, Japan, has developed technology that makes creating a playlists 
on your smartphone or MP3 player unnecessary. The company’s Mico headphones include 
sensors that monitor the user’s brain activity (different patterns in the prefrontal cortex indi-
cate different moods) to select the appropriate type of music. Neurowear says that Mico 
headphones provide “music inspiration from your subconscious.” Tense? Mico will select a
soothing ballad or a piece of classical music from your player to relax you. Drowsy? The head-
phones will select an upbeat, energetic tune to get you moving.36 ■
9. Fearing mistakes and failure. Creative people realize that trying something new often 
leads to failure; however, they do not see failure as an end. It represents a learning experi-
ence on the way to success. As you learned in Chapter 1, failure is an important part of the 
creative process; it signals entrepreneurs when to change their course of action. Entrepre-
neurship is all about the opportunity to fail! Many entrepreneurs failed numerous times 
before finally succeeding. Despite their initial setbacks, they were able to set aside the fear 
of failure and keep trying.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Arianna Huffington: Huffington Post Arianna 
Huffington, author of a dozen books and founder of the news and blog Web site
Huffington Post, says, “I love talking about my failures more than my successes. Think of fail-
ure as a stepping-stone to success. I was rejected by 35 publishers before getting to yes.” The
highly successful Huffington Post, which Huffington launched in 2005, attracts more than 
50 million unique visitors per month, more than the Web sites of any major newspaper in the 
United States.37 ■
The key is to see failure for what it really is: a chance to learn how to succeed. Entre-
preneurs who willingly risk failure and learn from it when it occurs have the best chance of 
succeeding at whatever they try. Charles F. Kettering, a famous inventor (he invented the 
lighting and ignition systems in automobiles, among other things), explains, “You fail be-
cause your ideas aren’t right, but you should learn to fail intelligently. When you fail, find
out why you failed and each time it will bring you nearer to the goal.”38 Successful entre-
preneurs equate failure with innovation rather than with defeat.
Thanks to technology, the cost of failed attempts at innovation has never been
lower. Entrepreneurs and companies can test new ideas at speeds and costs that were 
unimaginable only a few years ago. Building prototypes, getting them into potential
customers’ hands, and getting useful feedback on them has never been easier and less
expensive. Entrepreneurs use the Internet and social media to test their business models
and determine whether customers are interested in purchasing their product and service
innovations.
10. Believing that “I’m not creative.” Some people limit themselves because they believe that 
creativity belongs only to the Einsteins, Beethovens, and da Vincis of the world. Unfortu-
nately, this belief often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. A person who believes that he
or she is not creative will, in all likelihood, behave that way and will make that belief come
true. Some people who are considered geniuses, visionaries, and inventors actually are no
smarter and have no more innate creative ability than the average person; however, they 
have learned how to think creatively and are persistent enough to keep trying until they
succeed.
Successful entrepreneurs recognize that “I’m not creative” is merely an excuse for 
inaction. Everyone has within him or her the potential to be creative; not everyone will tap 
that potential, however. Successful entrepreneurs find a way to unleash their creative pow-
ers on problems and opportunities.
By avoiding these 10 mental locks, entrepreneurs can unleash their own creativity and the 
creativity of those around them as well. Successful entrepreneurs are willing to take some risks,
explore new ideas, play a little, ask “What if?” and learn to appreciate ambiguity. By doing so,

TABLE 3.1 Questions to Spur the Imagination
We learn at an early age to pursue answers to questions. Creative people, however, understand that good questions are extremely 
valuable in the quest for creativity. Some of the greatest breakthroughs in history came as a result of creative people asking thought-
provoking questions. Bill Bowerman, contemplating a design for the soles of running shoes over a breakfast of waffles, asked, “What 
would happen if I poured rubber into my waffle iron?” He did, and that’s how Nike shoes came to be. (Bowerman’s rubber-coated 
waffle iron is on display in the Nike Town superstore and museum in Chicago.) Albert Einstein, creator of the theory of relativity,
asked, “What would a light wave look like to someone keeping pace with it?”
To jump-start creativity, Steve Gillman suggests writing a short list of adjectives, such as light, cheap, fast, big, short, small,
and fun, and using them to ask what-if questions. What if this product could be lighter? What if this process could be faster? What if 
this service could be cheaper?
The following questions can help spur your imagination:
1. Is there a new way to do it?
2. Can you borrow or adapt it?
3. Can you give it a new twist?
4. Do you merely need more of the same?
5. Less of the same?
6. Is there a substitute?
7. Can you rearrange the parts?
8. What if you do just the opposite?
9. Can you combine ideas?
10. Are customers using your product or service in ways you never 
expected or intended?
11. Which customers are you not serving? What changes to 
your product or service are necessary to reach them?
12. Can you put it to other uses?
13. What else could we make from this?
14. Are there other markets for it?
15. Can you reverse it?
16. Can you rearrange it?
17. Can you put it to another use?
18. What idea seems impossible but, if executed, would
revolutionize your business?
Bob Purcell, CEO of Protean Electric, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, asked a simple but profound question: “What if we 
could convert any vehicle into a hybrid?” That question led the employees at the company to develop the Protean Drive Motor, a 
68-pound motor that installs directly onto an existing vehicle’s wheels and converts them to direct-drive, which eliminates the need 
for a transmission. Because the Protean Drive Motor contains a power inverter, electronics, and software to drive the system and costs 
between $1,500 and $1,800, it can be easily integrated into most existing vehicles, converting them to hybrid electric or pure electric 
vehicles without adding significant weight or cost. A lithium-ion battery pack installed beneath the car’s trunk and the car’s engine 
power the drive motors. The sophisticated system also funnels to the drive motors up to 85 percent of the kinetic energy it captures 
when the car brakes. Studies show that equipping a car with two drive motors adds 220 horsepower and improves its fuel efficiency by 
30 percent. Protean Electric recently landed $84 million in venture capital to finance the construction of a factory in Liyang, China, 
and is working with several automakers around the world to implement its fuel-saving technology. Protean has received 27 patents for 
its technology and designs.

How to Enhance Creativity
Enhancing Organizational Creativity
Creativity doesn’t just happen in organizations; entrepreneurs must establish an environment in 
which creativity can flourish—for themselves and for their workers. “Everyone has a creative spark,
but many factors can inhibit its ignition,” says one writer. “Part of an [entrepreneur’s] role is to see 
LO5

entrepreneurs can enhance

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
the spark in his or her people, encourage its ignition, and champion its success.”39 New ideas are 
fragile creations, but the right company culture can encourage people to develop and cultivate them.
Ensuring that workers have the freedom and the incentive to be creative is one of the best ways to 
achieve innovation. Entrepreneurs can stimulate their own creativity and encourage it among work-
ers by following these suggestions, which are designed to create a culture of innovation.
INCLUDE CREATIVITY AS A CORE COMPANY VALUE AND MAKE IT AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE 
COMPANY’S CULTURE Innovative companies do not take a passive approach to creativity; they 
are proactive in their search for new ideas. One of the best ways to set a creative tone throughout 
an organization begins with the company’s mission statement. Entrepreneurs should incorporate 
creativity and innovation into their companies’ mission statements and affirm their commitment to 
them in internal communications. Bell Labs, a predecessor to the high-tech companies of Silicon 
Valley, was the birthplace of some of the world’s greatest inventions, including the semiconductor 
chip, optical fiber, communication satellites, C programming language, and many others, from the 
1920s to the 1960s. For most of those years, Mervin Kelly, a former researcher, led the company 
with his vision of establishing an “institute of creative technology” that fostered “a busy exchange of 
ideas.” Employees at Bell Labs understood that their mission was to transform new knowledge into
transformational products that the company could commercialize.40 As Bell Labs proved, innovation 
allows a company to shape, transform, and create its future, and the starting point for defining that 
future is in the mission statement. If creativity and innovation are vital to a company’s success (and 
they usually are!), they also should be a natural part of the performance appraisal process.
Innovation can be a particularly powerful competitive weapon in industries that are resistant 
to change and are populated by companies that cling to the same old ways of doing business.
Even small companies that are willing to innovate can have a significant impact on entire in-
dustries by shaking up the status quo with their creative approaches. The result often is growing 
market share and impressive profits for the innovator.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: T. J. Scimone: Slice T. J. Scimone, founder of Slice, a prod-
uct design firm in Campbell, California, originally intended to improve the design of 
kitchen and houseware products when he launched his company in 2008. However, after Scimone 
came up with a better idea for a safer, more effective ceramic blade for opening shrink-wrapped 
packages that became his company’s best-selling item, he decided to focus his efforts on redesign-
ing common tools such as box cutters and scissors. Scimone noted that box cutters were unsafe, 
antiquated tools and set out to make them safer, more functional, and more aesthetically pleas-
ing. His company’s Slice box cutter features a nonslip handle with a wrap-around protective 
housing that serves as a natural shield for the user’s hand and that exposes only half of the
double-sided ceramic blade, which lasts up to 10 times longer than steel blades. The slim, comfort-
able design gives users so much control that they can carve out intricate shapes with surgical 
accuracy. The keys to the success of Slice’s box cutter, which has won numerous design awards, and 
its other products are simplicity and functionality. “We look for simple, incremental twists to exist-
ing products,” says Scott Herbst, the company’s director of industrial design.41 ■
HIRE FOR CREATIVITY Research published in the Sloan Management Review concludes that the
most effective way for companies to achieve continuous innovation over the long term is by 
hiring and cultivating talented people.42 Figure 3.3 shows the results of a survey of the CEOs
of Inc.’s 500 fastest growing companies about the factors that are most important to their 
companies’ ability to innovate. Often the most creative people also tend to be somewhat different, 
even eccentric. Two researchers call these employees “the odd clever people every organization 
needs” because they use their creativity to create disproportionate amounts of value for their 
companies.43 Hiring creative people was one of the keys to Bell Labs’ impressive record of 
innovation. The company hired the smartest people it could find from a variety of disciplines,
backgrounds, and philosophies; encouraged them to interact with and support one another; and
gave them the freedom to dream up creative ideas, many of which failed. The ones that succeeded,
however, changed the world.44
ESTABLISH AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT NOURISHES CREATIVITY John Kao, an 
economist whose nickname is “Mr. Creativity,” says innovative companies are structured like 
spaghetti rather than a traditional pyramid. In a spaghetti-style organization, employees are 

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
113
encouraged to mix and mingle constantly so that creative ideas flow freely throughout the 
company.45 At innovative companies, managers create organizational structures and cultures that 
emphasize the importance of creativity. At FremantleMedia Ltd., the London-based television
production company behind hit shows such as Idols and X Factor, managers have established a
structure that encourages and rewards creativity. Every year, the company sponsors Fremantle
Market, an event at which executives from production companies around the world pitch their 
ideas for new television shows to each other, often by showing a trial episode. Show creators 
explain the premise behind their shows and answer questions from their colleagues about target 
audiences, production costs, and the potential for links to other media, especially the Internet. 
Because of FremantleMedia’s internal licensing system, executives have the autonomy to decide
whether to purchase a show for distribution in their own countries. Shows that attract the most 
interest receive funding and go on the air.46
EMBRACE DIVERSITY One of the best ways to cultivate a culture of creativity is to hire a diverse
workforce. When people solve problems or come up with ideas, they do so within the framework 
of their own experience. Hiring people from different backgrounds, cultural experiences, 
hobbies, and interests provides a company with crucial raw materials needed for creativity. Smart 
entrepreneurs enhance organizational creativity by hiring beyond their own comfort zones.
Focusing the talent and creativity of a diverse group of employees on a problem or challenge
is one of the best ways to generate creative solutions. Research by Harvard Business School
professor Karim Lakhani concludes that the experiences, viewpoints, and thought processes of 
diverse groups of people are powerful tools for solving problems creatively. “It’s very counterin-
tuitive,” says Lakhani, “but not only did the odds of a [problem] solver’s success actually increase 
in fields outside his expertise, but also the further a challenge was from his specialty, the greater 
was the likelihood of success.”47 The lesson for entrepreneurs: to increase the odds of a successful 
creative solution to a problem, involve in the process people whose background and experience 
lies outside the particular problem area. One manager says, “They create a little grit to stimulate 
the oyster to produce a pearl.”48
EXPECT CREATIVITY Employees tend to rise—or fall—to the level of expectations that entrepre-
neurs have of them. One of the best ways to communicate the expectation of creativity is to 
encourage them to be creative.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Greg Creed: Taco Bell As Taco Bell, the chain of fast-food 
Mexican restaurants, approached its 50th birthday, CEO Greg Creed challenged a team of
employees to reinvent the company’s traditional crunchy taco. Brainstorming sessions produced
more than 30 potential ideas, but the one that generated the most interest was a Doritos-flavored 
taco shell packed with Taco Bell ingredients. In an early test, the team purchased a paint-spray gun 
at Home Depot so that they could spray Doritos flavoring onto a taco shell. Once Taco Bell’s test
kitchen developed a prototype, taste tests began, and the product was a flop with customers. The
team went back to the drawing board and experimented with 45 recipes before narrowing the 
field to three for market testing. The tests, which were conducted in a handful of cities around
the country, resulted in a clear winner, and soon the Internet was buzzing with hype about Taco 
Bell’s new taco. The company introduced the Doritos Locos Taco, and it became the most success-
ful product launch in Taco Bell history, selling 100 million tacos in just 10 weeks and increasing 
company sales by 13 percent. Taco Bell has since introduced the Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Taco, 
and with 123 flavors of Doritos from which to choose, has more new tacos planned.49 ■
EXPECT FAILURE AND LEARN FROM IT Creative ideas will produce failures as well as successes.
People who never fail are not being creative. Creativity requires taking chances, and managers
must remove employees’ fear of failure. The surest way to quash creativity throughout an
organization is to punish employees who try something new and fail. Google allows employees to
spend up to 20 percent of their time working on “pet projects” that they find exciting and believe
have potential. In addition, Google provides seed capital for its employees’ most promising ideas. 
The company credits its policy with creating some of its most successful product innovations,
including Gmail, its Web-based e-mail service.50
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jason Seiken: PBS Digital When Jason Seiken became 
head of PBS’s then-struggling digital division, he went beyond expecting failure and an-
nounced to employees that failure was required. “If you don’t fail enough times during the com-
ing year, you’ll be downgraded because if you’re not failing enough, you’re playing it safe,” he
says. “The idea was to deliver a clear message: Move fast. Iterate fast. Be entrepreneurial. Don’t
be afraid that if you stretch and sprint you might break things. Executive leadership has your 
back.” The change among employees was immediate, profound, and exactly what Seiken was try-
ing to achieve. Employees began trying innovative ideas for the PBS Web site, many of which 
failed and some of which became huge successes. Had Seiken not shaken up the existing culture 
with the “failure requirement,” many of those ideas would never have come to light. One idea, 
Garden of Your Mind, was a remix of old Mr. Rogers clips in which the genteel host bursts into
Y
song; within 48 hours of posting, the video topped the most viewed and most shared video on
YouTube. 
Y
Seiken’s attitude toward failure spread across the organization as employees adopted
the mantra, “Reinvent PBS.”51 ■
INCORPORATE FUN INTO THE WORK ENVIRONMENT Smart entrepreneurs know work should be
fun, and although they expect employees to work hard, they create a company culture that allows 
employees to have fun. “If you want creative workers, give them enough time to play,” says
actor John Cleese. At Radio Flyer, the Chicago-based company that makes the classic little red
wagon for children, employees routinely participate in fun activities at work that include karaoke,
tricycle races, pumpkin-carving contests, a Hollywood Squares game, and others. CEO Robert 
Pasin intentionally has made fun events a part of the company’s culture. “There’s method to the
madness,” says the company’s “chief wagon officer,” pointing out that the company’s success 
depends on creative employees who are motivated and engaged in their work.52
ENCOURAGE CURIOSITY Curiosity is an important ingredient in creativity. Children are innately 
curious, which is one reason they are so creative. Creativity expert Hal Gregersen says innovators 
constantly question the world around them and involve others in helping them in answering the 
questions they pose. Entrepreneurs and their employees constantly should ask “what-if” questions 
and take a “maybe-we-could” attitude. Challenging standing assumptions about how something 
should be done (“We’ve always done it that way.”) is an excellent springboard for creativity. 
Doing so allows people to break out of assumptions that limit creativity. Supporting employees’
extracurricular activities also can spur creativity on the job. For instance, M. P. Muller, founder 
of Door Number 3, a branding agency, paid for a comedy improvisation class for the company’s 
art director, believing that it would enhance the director’s creative talents.53

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
115
Encouraging employees to “think big” also helps. Creativity expert John Kao points out that,
although incremental innovation can be useful, it is not likely to make a company a winner. In-
stead, the real opportunity for creating a significant competitive edge lies in creating innovations 
that disrupt and revolutionize an entire industry.
DESIGN A WORK SPACE THAT ENCOURAGES CREATIVITY The physical environment in which 
people work has an impact on their level of creativity. The cubicles made so famous in the Dilbert 
cartoon strip can suck creativity right out of a work space. Transforming a typical office space—
even one with cubicles—into a haven of creativity does not have to be difficult or expensive. 
Covering bland walls with funny posters, photographs, murals, or other artwork; adding splashes 
of color; and incorporating live plants enliven a work space and enhance creativity. Designs 
that foster employee interaction, especially informal interaction, enhance an organization’s 
creative power.
Because creativity is at the heart of their jobs, employees at Davison Design and Development, 
a product design company, work in a setting that more closely resembles an amusement park than 
an office complex. CEO George Davison designed the office, known as Inventionland™, to get 
employees out of their offices, to interact with one another, and to be inspired by a fun, whimsical 
environment. The 60,000-square-foot space resembles an amusement park and includes a pirate 
ship where employees design toys and games for clients and a Thinktank Treehouse for hard-
ware designers. Davison calls Inventionland™ “the world’s most innovative workplace” and says
the unusual design has helped fuel the company’s growth.54 Even though creating their own version 
of Inventionland™ may not be practical for most businesses, entre-
preneurs can stimulate creativity by starting meetings with some
type of short, fun exercise designed to encourage participants to
think creatively.
VIEW PROBLEMS AS OPPORTUNITIES Every problem offers the 
opportunity for innovation. One of the best ways to channel a
company’s innovative energy productively is to address ques-
tions  that focus employees’ attention on customers’ problems 
and how to solve them.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Roni and Ken Di Lullo:
Doggles On a trip to the dog park with their border
collie, Midknight, Roni and Ken Di Lullo noticed that Midknight 
kept missing the Frisbee during their game of fetch. They soon 
discovered that he was sensitive to sunlight, which led Roni to 
retrofit a pair of sports goggles for Midknight. People who saw
Midknight were so amused that Roni created a Web site with
photos of their beloved dog wearing his sports goggles. Before 
long, dog owners began contacting Roni, asking to purchase a
pair of goggles for their pets. To fill each order, Roni purchased a

pair of sports goggles and modified them to fit each customer’s dog. As sales grew, Roni realized
that she had inadvertently launched a unique business, something she never intended to do 
because she had a full-time job as a software developer. She named the product Doggles and 
found an eyewear manufacturer in Taiwan who created goggles with a broader nose bridge and 
deeper lens cup that would fit a wide range of dogs, from Chihuahuas to Great Danes. Every
pair of Doggles features shatterproof, anti-fog lenses that block 100 percent of UV rays and 
adjustable head and chin straps. Doggles also offers goggles with prescription lenses for 
dogs that have undergone cataract surgery. Doggles sell for $16 to $20 per pair at more than 
3,500 pet boutiques and at stores such as Target, Amazon, and Petco. Today, Doggles generates 
more than $3 million in annual sales.55 ■
PROVIDE CREATIVITY TRAINING Almost everyone has the capacity to be creative, but developing 
that capacity requires training. Training accomplished through books, seminars, workshops, and 
professional meetings can help everyone learn to tap their creative capacity.
ELIMINATE BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES AND PROVIDE THE SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR INNO-
VATION Just as a good carpenter needs certain tools to do his or her job, employees need 
certain resources and support to be creative, including freedom from bureaucracy to pursue 
their ideas. Do innovators need hardware, software, time to collaborate, or other resources? 
Entrepreneurs also must remember that creativity often requires nonwork phases, and giving 
employees time to “daydream” is an important part of the creative process. The creativity that 
employees display when they know managers value innovation can be amazing—and profitable. 
These intrapreneurs, entrepreneurs who operate within the framework of an existing business,
sometimes can transform a company’s future or advance its competitive edge. To encourage 
intrapreneurial innovation, Microsoft renovated one of its older buildings, transforming it into
the Garage, an incubator equipped with all of the latest technology for employees to explore 
and develop ideas they have for new products and services. Garage director Quinn Hawkins 
says the inspiration for the incubator (and its name) came from all of the great companies, such 
as Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and Amazon, that started in garages. After receiving four e-mails 
in one week with missing attachments, software engineer Bhavesh Chauhan used the Garage’s 
resources to develop a program that automatically scans e-mails for words that indicate that 
the user intends to send an attachment. If the e-mail contains no attachment, a notice pops up 
to alert the user. Chauhan’s forgotten attachment detector appeared in Microsoft’s Office 2013 
software.56
DEVELOP A PROCEDURE FOR CAPTURING IDEAS Small companies that are outstanding innovators
do not earn that mantle by accident; they have a process in place to solicit and then collect new 
ideas. When workers come up with creative ideas, however, not every organization is prepared 
to capture them. The unfortunate result is that ideas that might have vaulted a company ahead 
of its competition or made people’s lives better simply evaporate. Without a structured approach 
for collecting employees’ creative concepts, a business leaves its future to chance. Clever 
entrepreneurs establish processes within their companies that are designed to harvest the results 
of employees’ creativity. Sadler’s Wells, a dance group that operates three theaters in London and 
whose mission is to be the center of innovation in dance, has fashioned a procedure for capturing
and developing creative ideas. Representatives scout a variety of promising dancers and invite 
them to its studios, where they work together in small teams to develop new dance performances.
The dance teams present their creations to Sadler’s Wells’ producers, theater managers, and 
dancers. Sadler’s Wells invests in the creations that offer the greatest potential, often testing them
in its smaller theaters before taking them to its main stage.57
TALK WITH CUSTOMERS—OR, BETTER YET, INTERACT WITH THEM Innovative companies take 
the time to get feedback about how customers use the companies’ products or services, listening
for new ideas. The voice of the customer can be an important source of creative ideas, and the 
Internet allows entrepreneurs to hear their customers’ voices quickly and inexpensively. Some
companies observe their customers actually using their products or services to glean ideas that 
may lead to improvements and new features. Other companies go further, forging alliances with 
customers to come up with creative ideas and develop new products based on them. A recent 
survey of the CEOs of Inc.’s 500 fastest growing companies, reports that although customers are 
intrapreneurs
entrepreneurs who operate 
within the framework of an 
existing business.

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
117
the most common source of ideas for new products and services, only 37 percent of companies 
have a formal process for collecting customers’ ideas.58
MONITOR EMERGING TRENDS AND IDENTIFY WAYS YOUR COMPANY CAN CAPITALIZE ON THEM 
Tracking trends is an excellent way to generate ideas for new products, services, or business 
models. Taco Bell, the quick-service chain of Mexican restaurants, invests resources in
monitoring demographic and social trends that influence customers’ dining habits. One trend 
the company recently identified is the demand for healthier menus. To capitalize on this trend, 
Taco Bell worked with celebrity chef Lorena Garcia to introduce a fresher, lighter, and healthier 
Cantina Bell product line. Market tests show that the Cantina Bell line is popular among women
and older customers and has enhanced customers’ perceptions of Taco Bell’s quality image. 
Just one year after its launch, Cantina Bell products accounted for 5 percent of the company’s 
sales. Taco Bell normally creates about 200 new product ideas each year before winnowing them 
down to about 20 products to introduce into test markets. Those that succeed in the test markets 
are rolled out nationwide. “Fail to innovate at your own risk,” says Taco Bell’s chief marketing 
officer.59
LOOK FOR USES FOR YOUR COMPANY’S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN OTHER MARKETS Focusing
on the “traditional” uses of a product or service limits creativity—and a company’s sales. Entrepreneurs 
can boost sales by finding new applications, often in unexpected places, for their products 
and services.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Neil Wadhawan and Raj Raheja: Heartwood Studios
In 2002, Neil Wadhawan and Raj Raheja launched Heartwood Studios, a company that 
produced three-dimensional renderings and animations of buildings and products for architects 
and designers. Their business was successful, but a brainstorming session helped the entrepre-
neurs to realize that their company’s three-dimensional renderings had applications in other in-
dustries as well. Today Heartwood Studios has clients in the defense and aerospace industries as
well as in the fields of entertainment and sports. In fact, the company creates animations for use 
on the giant screens in sports arenas for several professional sports teams.60 ■
REWARD CREATIVITY Entrepreneurs can encourage creativity by rewarding it when it occurs.
Financial rewards can be effective motivators of creative behavior, but nonmonetary rewards,
such as praise, recognition, and celebration, usually offer more powerful incentives for creativity.
MODEL CREATIVE BEHAVIOR Creativity is “caught” as much as it is “taught.” Companies that 
excel at innovation find that the passion for creativity starts at the top. Entrepreneurs who set 
examples of creative behavior, taking chances, and challenging the status quo soon find their 
employees doing the same.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jason Fried: 37signals Jason Fried, cofounder of 37signals,
a Chicago-based software company, compares his company’s product line to the apple trees 
on his farm. Fried routinely prunes his apple trees, noting that pruning gives them a stronger
foundation for the future. Fried applies that same logic to his company, regularly pruning the 
company’s software products. Observers were stunned when Fried sold to another business a ser-
vice that generated $17,000 per month in profit for 37signals. A few months later, however, at a
company meeting, the staff came up with ideas for two new products, one a variation of an exist-
ing product, and the other a totally new product. Fried says that the ideas for new products would 
never have emerged unless 37signals took the bold step of cutting some of its old products. Grow-
ing strong new limbs in a business requires the entrepreneur to prune away the old ones.61 ■
DON’T FORGET ABOUT BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION As Jason Fried’s experience suggests,
creating new products and services is the lifeblood of a company’s long-term success; however, 
business model innovations can produce significant impact on a business as well. A study by 
the consulting firm Doblin Group reveals that although companies focus most of their creative
resources on developing new products and product extensions, those investments are least likely
to produce a positive return. In fact, the success rate for new products and product extensions 
is just 4.5 percent. Innovations in a company’s business model, customer service process,
distribution system, customer value stream, and internal processes produce higher rates of return.62

118
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Apple’s iTunes store has proved to be a valuable business model innovation, providing a system
for billions of people to download music, apps, ebooks, and movies conveniently and easily.
Since its launch in 2001, iTune’s 500 million-plus active users have downloaded more than 
50 billion apps and 25 billion songs (from its library of 35 million songs). Apple’s business model
innovation now generates $16 billion in annual revenue for the company.63
Enhancing Individual Creativity
Just as entrepreneurs can cultivate an environment of creativity in their organizations by using 
the techniques described previously, they can enhance their own creativity by using the following 
techniques.
ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE CREATIVE As we have seen, one of the biggest obstacles to creativity 
occurs when a person believes he or she is not creative. A recent study by Adobe shows that just 
52 percent of people in the United States (and only 39 percent of people globally) believe they
are creative.64 Giving yourself the permission to be creative is the first step toward establishing
a pattern of creative thinking. Refuse to give in to the temptation to ignore ideas simply because 
you fear that someone else may consider them “stupid.” When it comes to creativity, there are no 
stupid ideas!
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Robert Bigelow: Bigelow Aerospace As a child living in
Las Vegas, Robert Bigelow witnessed the mushroom clouds from the first tests of atomic 
bombs in the Nevada desert. Fascinated by science, Bigelow soon was captivated by stories of
space travel. Bigelow went on to build a highly successful hotel chain, Budget Suites America, that
made him a billionaire. In 1998, the hotelier launched Bigelow Aerospace, a company that 
recently signed a contract with NASA to provide a new type of inflatable space pod called the 
Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) to be attached to the International Space Station 
(ISS). The module, which resembles a large balloon made of kevlar and other high-tech materials, 
provides many advantages, including low cost and light weight, and is 50 percent cheaper to
launch than traditional rigid modules. Once in space, astronauts simply attach the BEAM to the ISS
and inflate it to its full 560-cubic-foot volume. Bigelow’s long-term goal is to use BEAM technol-
ogy to create inexpensive commercial space stations to lease to businesses, governments, and 
wealthy individuals who want to spend time in space.65 ■
FORGET THE “RULES” Creative individuals take a cue from Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates 
of the Caribbean series of movies. When faced with a difficult (sometimes impossible) situation, 
Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) usually operates outside the rules and, as a result, comes
up with innovative solutions. Sparrow’s unwillingness to be encumbered by rules frees him to 
develop innovative, often unusual solutions to the problems he encounters.
GIVE YOUR MIND FRESH INPUT EVERY DAY To be creative, your mind needs stimulation. Do
something different each day—listen to a new radio station, take a walk through a park or a
shopping center, or pick up a magazine you never read.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Doris Raymond: The Way We Wore The Way We Wore, 
a huge vintage clothing store in Los Angeles started by Doris Raymond in 2004 that stocks 
garments from the Victorian era to the 1980s, has become a destination for designers from many 
fashion houses and retailers, ranging from Marc Jacobs to Forever 21, who are looking for inspira-
tion for their clothing collections. Recognizing that meeting customers’ demand for fresh designs 
gives their clothing lines a competitive advantage, many designers are looking to the past for 
creative ideas, taking note not only of fabrics and patterns but also of the smallest details, such as
buttons and the type of stitching used on pockets. These fashion experts have discovered that
exposing their minds to “new” designs is a great way to stimulate their own creativity.66 ■
TAKE UP A HOBBY Hobbies provide not only an avenue to escape your regular routine, but they 
also give your mind fresh input that can be a source of creative ideas. Izhar Gafni, a bicycling 
enthusiast, was in a bicycle shop talking about his hobby (“Bicycling is in my soul,” he says) when 
the conversation turned to a man who had invented a cardboard canoe. The concept fascinated 
him. “Why not make a bicycle out of cardboard?” he wondered. Gafni went to work and 
invented a low-cost, eco-friendly bicycle made entirely out of recycled cardboard and car tires.

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
119
Tight folding gives the cardboard frame strength, and a special coating makes the cardboard 
waterproof and fireproof. Although the bike weighs just 27 pounds, it is strong enough to support 
a 275-pound passenger. Gafni, who started Cardboard Technologies to market his invention, says 
each bike costs between $9 and $12 to build, and he plans to sell them for $20 each.67
TRAVEL—AND OBSERVE Visiting other countries (even other states) is a creativity stimulant. 
Travelers see new concepts and engage in new experiences that can spark creative ideas. While 
on vacation, Tom Adeyoola watched his girlfriend revel in the inexpensive custom-made clothing 
available in Vietnam because she was frustrated by the poor fit of most off-the-rack products
available in online shops in their native United Kingdom. Adeyoola began to ponder ways of 
improving the traditional online buying experience and came up with the idea of a tool that 
allows online shoppers to try on clothing virtually. A Cambridge professor connected him with 
a former student, and the two young men started Metail, a London-based technology company 
that allows shoppers to upload basic body measurements and photos of themselves that Metail
transforms into a three-dimensional avatar that is 94 to 96 percent accurate. Customers who shop 
at companies that subscribe to Metail can use their avatars to try on virtual garments to test their 
fit. With Metail, customers find clothes that fit them better, and retailers experience lower costs 
due to returns from poor-fitting items.68
OBSERVE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF OTHER COMPANIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN COM-
PLETELY DIFFERENT MARKETS Creative entrepreneurs often borrow ideas from companies that 
are in businesses totally unrelated to their own. The founders of Project Frog, a San Francisco-
based builder, noted the popularity of eco-friendly modular residential homes and applied the
concept to building prefabricated schools and government buildings faster and cheaper than 
traditional “stick-built” structures. CEO Ann Hand soon extended the company’s reach into retail 
and healthcare. “We design a common chassis for different types of buildings that people can 
reprogram according to their needs,” she says. Project Frog uses sophisticated software to create
a three-dimensional model of a structure before it actually manufactures all of the individual
components for on-site assembly. Its buildings include energy-saving features, optimize the use 
of natural light, and result in cost savings of up to 30 percent. Project Frog, which has attracted 
$30 million in venture capital, generates more than $25 million in annual sales.69
RECOGNIZE THE CREATIVE POWER OF MISTAKES AND ACCIDENTS Innovations sometimes are the
result of serendipity, finding something while looking for something else, and sometimes they 
arise as a result of mistakes or accidents. Creative people recognize that even their errors may 
lead to new ideas, products, and services. Louis Daguerre, a scene painter for the Paris Opera,
was fascinated with lighting and in 1822 began conducting experiments with the effect of light 
on translucent screens. In 1829, Daguerre formed a partnership with Joseph Niecpe, who had 
invented a primitive version of photography called the heliograph in 1829. (The exposure time
for Niecpe’s first photograph was a mere eight hours!) The two men worked for years trying
to capture photographic images on metal plates treated with silver iodide, but they made little 
progress before Niecpe died in 1833. One evening in 1835, Daguerre placed one of his treated 
plates in his chemical cupboard, intending to recoat it for other experiments. When he removed it 
later, he was surprised to see a photographic image with brilliant highlights. Excited but puzzled 
by the outcome, Daguerre finally discovered that mercury vapors from a broken thermometer in
the cupboard had caused the photographic image to appear on the treated metal plate. Daguerre 
refined the process, naming it Daguerreotype after himself. The world of modern photography 
was born—and an accident played a significant role.70
NOTICE WHAT IS MISSING Sometimes entrepreneurs spot viable business opportunities by noticing 
something, often very practical and simple, that is missing. The first step is to determine whether 
a market for the missing product or service actually exists (perhaps the reason it does not exist is 
that there is not market potential), which is one of the objectives of building a business plan.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Mark Bowles and EcoATM Fewer than 20 percent of the 
discarded electronic devices in the United States are recycled; most are burned or dumped 
in landfills, where they leak dangerous chemicals into the environment. After spending 25 years 
in the wireless and technology industries, serial entrepreneur Mark Bowles noticed that no one 

120
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
was doing anything about the problem and decided it was time to take action. Inspired by Coin-
star change-counting machines that he saw in many locations, Bowles spent three years develop-
ing the ecoATM, an ATM-like machine that uses an artificial intelligence-based vision system to
recognize 4,000 types of phones, MP3 players, and tablets and identify any damage. The ecoATM 
taps into a real-time global auction system to offer customers competitive prices for their old 
electronic devices. The machine even has thumbprint scanning technology designed to thwart 
thieves who might try to use the ecoATM as a fence for stolen e-devices. EcoATM resells 75 percent 
of the devices it collects to refurbishers with the remainder of them going to authorized e-waste 
recyclers. With 500 kiosks already in place across the United States, Bowles is making plans to 
expand ecoATM internationally. ■
LOOK FOR WAYS TO TURN TRASH INTO TREASURE Some entrepreneurs achieve success by
finding creative ways to turn trash into treasure. Before coffee growers can ship coffee beans to
coffee makers, they must strip away the skin of the fruit that surrounds the bean. In Hawaii alone,
coffee growers throw away 40 million pounds of coffee fruit skins each year. Serial entrepreneur 
Shaun Roberts took note and developed a way to transform coffee fruit skin, which also contains
caffeine and is packed with antioxidants, into a line of energy drinks called KonaRed. His 
15-person company, based in Kalaheo, Hawaii, purchases coffee fruit skins from growers, dries
them, and processes them into a thick, molasses-like concentrate that it mixes with various
fruit juices to create a line of healthful beverages. In addition to selling KonaRed through retail
outlets in Hawaii and on the mainland, Roberts’s company offers monthly subscriptions through 
its Web site.71
KEEP A JOURNAL HANDY TO RECORD YOUR THOUGHTS AND IDEAS Creative ideas are too valu-
able to waste, so always keep a journal nearby to record them as soon as you get them. Leonardo 
da Vinci was famous for writing down ideas as they struck him. Patrick McNaughton invented 
the neon blackboards that restaurants use to advertise their specials. In addition to the neon 
blackboard, McNaughton has invented more than 30 new products, many of which are sold 
through the company he and his sister, Jamie, own. McNaughton credits much of his creative
success to the fact that he writes down every idea he gets and keeps it in a special folder. “There’s
no such thing as a crazy idea,” he insists.72
LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE No rule of creativity says an idea has to be your own! Sometimes the 
best business ideas come from someone else, but entrepreneurs are the ones to act on them.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Cameron Roelofson: Splash Mobile Car Wash
Cameron Roelofson, owner of Splash Mobile Car Wash in Concord, Ontario, washes
2,500 tractor-trailer trucks per week during warm months, but sales in his highly seasonal busi-
ness fall to nothing during the frigid winters. On one cold winter day, Roelofson was talking
with an acquaintance who asked if he would use his mobile truck-washing equipment to put 
water into an outdoor skating rink. He agreed and quickly realized the potential for a business 
that would offset seasonality in sales in his truck-washing business. Roelofson began advertising, 
and sales took off. For $1,000 to $2,000, Splash builds a frame with a reusable liner and then fills 
it with water. Three days later, frozen solid in Ontario’s winter weather, the rink is ready for skat-
ing or hockey. In the spring, Splash returns to disassemble the rink and store it until the next
winter.73 ■
LISTEN TO CUSTOMERS Some of the best ideas for new products and services or new applications 
of an existing product or service come from a company’s customers. Entrepreneurs who take the
time to listen to their customers often receive ideas that they may never have come up with on 
their own. “You must talk to and deeply understand your customers to build products, services, 
and experiences that work in today’s consumer-driven market,” says Eric Holtzclaw, founder 
and CEO of Laddering Works, a marketing and product strategy firm. Middleby Marshall, a 
foodservice equipment maker founded in 1888, relies on feedback from customers to guide 
its new product development efforts. The company recently introduced its CTX oven, which
combines a griddle, a fryer, and a charbroiler into a single unit that cooks food fasters, uses less
energy, and improves the efficiency of commercial kitchens. “Our business is built on a high 
degree of customer interaction,” says president Mark Sieron. “We listen to our customers, and 
that’s what drives our innovation.”74

GET ADEQUATE SLEEP Sleep restores both our bodies and our brains. A study by the Mental 
Health Foundation shows a correlation between sound sleep and a person’s ability to produce
creative ideas and new insights.75
WATCH A MOVIE Great business ideas come from the strangest places, even the movies. As a 
child, Stanley Yang was fascinated by sci-fi movies such as Star Wars. That fascination led him to 
become an engineer so that he could transform his ideas into reality. Yang’s company, NeuroSky,
has developed headsets that allow people to control video games with their minds using biosensor 
technology, a concept used by an advanced alien race in the movie Battle Los Angeles. “Movies
may spark an idea,” says Yang, who still dreams of building a functional light saber.
TALK TO A CHILD As we grow older, we learn to conform to society’s expectations about many 
things, including creative solutions to problems. Children place very few limitations on their 
thinking; as a result, their creativity is practically boundless. (Remember all the games you and 
your friends invented when you were young?)
DO SOMETHING ORDINARY IN AN UNUSUAL WAY Experts say that simply doing something 
out of the ordinary can stimulate creativity. To stimulate his own creativity, Scott Jones, an
entrepreneur who is known as “the guy who invented voice mail” (and many other items as well), 
often engages in what other people might consider bizarre behavior—eating without utensils, 
watching television sitting one foot away from the screen, or taking a shower with his eyes
closed. “Anything I normally do, I’ll do differently just to see what happens,” says Jones.76
KEEP A TOY BOX IN YOUR OFFICE Your box might include silly objects, such as wax lips, a yo-yo, 
a Slinky, fortune cookie sayings, feathers, a top, a compass, or a host of other items. When you are 
stumped, pick an item at random from the toy box and think about how it relates to your problem.
TAKE NOTE OF YOUR “PAIN POINTS” Do other people experience them as well? Entrepreneurs 
often create innovations to solve problems they themselves face. Observing “pain points” that 
result from missing products or services or flaws in existing products or services can be an
excellent source of business ideas.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Donna Browning: Sweaty Bands Fitness instructor
Donna Browning was tired of elastic headbands that kept slipping out of place during her 
exercise classes and decided to make one that would stay put. She borrowed a sewing machine and 
made several prototypes to test. She discovered that velvet–lined ribbon with elastic worked best.
Browning made a batch of headbands, gave a few as gifts, and sold the rest out of her gym bag. 
The positive feedback from her early customers encouraged Browning to start Sweaty Bands with
her husband, and the copreneurs soon were selling headbands online at $15 to $18 each. Aggres-
sive marketing and public relations sparked sales, and Sweaty Bands now sells 250,000 headbands 
per year and employs 100 people. The Brownings recently signed a deal to make sorority-themed 
Sweaty Bands and are exploring potential relationships with college and professional sports teams. 
Sales recently hit $12 million and continue to grow rapidly.77 ■
DO NOT THROW AWAY SEEMINGLY “BAD” IDEAS Some creative ideas prove to be impractical, 
too costly, or too silly to work. Creative entrepreneurs, however, do not discard these seemingly 
bad ideas. Instead, they ask, “What part of this idea can I build on?” and “What could I change
about this idea to make it work?” They realize that seemingly bad ideas can be the nucleus of 
a really good idea. West Paw Design, a company based in Bozeman, Montana, that produces 
eco-friendly pet toys, sponsors a creativity contest in which its 36 employees, from president to
seamstresses, form small teams to develop prototypes of new product ideas. The winning team 
receives the coveted Golden Hairball Award, a statue reminiscent of the Oscar but with one of 
the company’s cat toys perched atop its head. President Spencer Williams says many of the great 
ideas for new products come from ideas that don’t win the contest. The company’s R&D team 
meets after each contest to review all of the ideas employees submit. “We look for one piece of 
l
a new idea,” he says.78
COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS Working with other people to solve a problem or to generate ideas 
brings a fresh perspective to the situation. Two or more people usually are more creative than one 
person working alone. GE, a company that owns thousands of patents, recently partnered with

122
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Quirky, a crowdsourcing site that allows an online community of more than 500,000 inventors to 
collaborate on generating ideas and solving problems, to get new ideas on ways to use its patents.
Inventors on Quirky are busy finding new ways to apply technology from GE such as coatings 
that protect electronics from moisture and a device that cools jet engines. Inventors whose ideas
prove commercially viable share in the profits they generate. Ben Kaufman, cofounder of Quirky, 
says his goal is to create an invention machine.79
READ BOOKS ON STIMULATING CREATIVITY OR TAKE A CLASS ON CREATIVITY Creative thinking 
is a technique anyone can learn. Understanding and applying the principles of creativity can 
improve dramatically the ability to develop new and innovative ideas.
DOODLE Research shows that engaging in artistic activities, even as simple as doodling,
stimulates creativity.80 Doodling keeps a person’s brain engaged even when he or she not focused 
on a particular task.
TAKE SOME TIME OFF Relaxation is vital to the creative process. Getting away from a problem 
gives the mind time to reflect on it. It is often during this time, while the subconscious works on 
a problem, that the mind generates many creative solutions. One study reports that 35 percent of 
entrepreneurs say they come up with their best ideas during downtime, when they are away from 
work.81 One creativity expert claims that fishing is the ideal activity for stimulating creativity. 
“Your brain is on high alert in case a fish is around,” he says, “but your brain is completely 
relaxed. This combination is the time when you have the ‘Aha!’ moment.”82
BE PERSISTENT Entrepreneurs know that one secret to success is persistence and a “don’t-quit”
attitude. Twelve publishers rejected J. K. Rowling’s manuscript about the adventures of a boy 
wizard and his friends, which she started writing at age 25 when she was a single mother trying 
to raise her children on welfare. Finally, Bloomsbury, a small London publishing house, agreed 
to publish 1,000 copies of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. Rowling’s seven-part Harry 
Potter book series went on to sell more than 450 million copies worldwide, making Rowling the 
first billionaire author.83
Creativity and innovation traditionally have played an important 
part in entrepreneurial success. Today, their role has become an 
even more vital component as businesses face increasing pres-
sure to produce innovations to remain competitive. One writer 
notes that until recently people achieved success by copying other
people, taking what they know and applying it. Today, however,
because unique challenges are a regular part of life, success goes
to those brave enough to cross boldly into the unknown.
Entrepreneurs are among the brave souls who challenge ex-
isting ideas, norms, values, and business practices and often pro-
duce valuable breakthrough products that make them and their 
companies terrific success stories. What lessons can we learn from 
successful entrepreneurs about innovation?
Embrace Fear
Creative entrepreneurs face their fears. Ask yourself, “What
frightens me about my business?” Are you fearful that a competi-
tor will introduce a new product or service that will make yours 
obsolete? Are you concerned that customers may find your prod-
uct or service less appealing? Are trade shows still the best way
to reach your customers? Once you have identified the fears that 
most concern you, address them. Explore them. If you were intro-
ducing your company’s product or service today, what would it 
look like? What features would it offer?
Recognize That “Innovation” Is Not Necessarily
Synonymous with “Invention”
Some of the most successful entrepreneurs in history actually did 
not invent the products that made them famous. Henry Ford,
founder of Ford Motor Company, said, “I invented nothing new.
I simply assembled into a car the discoveries of other men behind
whom were centuries of work.” Of course, Ford did make inno-
vations in the auto assembly process, creating in 1913 the first 
mass-assembly process that made cars affordable for the average 
person. Similarly, Keyvan Mohajer, founder of San Jose, California-
based SoundHound, took technology that has been around for
years, music recognition, and created an app that made it easier 
for people to use. His company’s Sound2Sound technology rec-
ognizes and identifies any song (even those that a person simply 
hums) and provides the user with instant access to information

The Creative Process
Although creative ideas may appear to strike as suddenly as a bolt of lightning, they are actually 
the result of the creative process, which involves seven steps:
1. Preparation
2. Investigation
3. Transformation
4. Incubation
5. Illumination
pertaining to the song, such as biographical sketches of the art-
ist, lyrics, videos, concert dates, upcoming tours, and more. In 
just two years, the company’s customer base has grown from
10 million to more than 100 million. Like Mohajer, successful en-
trepreneurs often find new ways to connect existing technologies 
to create value.
Find the Intersection of “Problem” and “Solution”
Some entrepreneurs launch businesses with a focus on market-
ing their products or services to a particular audience but fail 
to ask whether their products and services actually solve a real 
problem customers face. “If you’re not solving a problem, the 
world won’t care,” explains Ben Kaufman, founder of Quirky, 
a social product development company that serves aspiring in-
ventors. Successful innovators often spot a “pain point” in their 
own lives and realize that other people face the same problem
as well. As a New York City native, Internet entrepreneur Jay 
Bregman was very familiar with the inefficiencies in the taxi cab
industry. At any given moment, thousands of cabs in major cit-
ies are looking for fares, while thousands of people are trying
to hail cabs. In fact, Bregman’s research shows that taxis in New
York City spend 40 percent of their time cruising for fares, while 
potential passengers have difficulty finding cabs. Bregman, two 
other Internet entrepreneurs, and three New York City cab driv-
ers found the intersection of “problem” and “solution” when 
they created Hailo, a company that markets an app that con-
nects cab drivers with passengers for a small fee. Hailo allows
passengers to locate a cab within two minutes with just two taps 
on their smart phones and has become the world’s most popular 
taxi app. Bregman and his cofounders now are turning their at-
tention to developing apps for other markets that suffer from 
similar inefficiencies.
Entrepreneurs often spot “pain points” by noting the
following:
•
Complaints they hear from other people
•
The inconvenience of buying a product or service
•
A fundamental flaw in an existing product or service
•
A product or service that can make life easier
•
A product or service that can add to one’s well-being
•
A simpler way to access a product or service
Realize That Innovation Typically Is the Result 
of an Iterative Feedback Cycle
Innovations often come about when entrepreneurs come up with
an idea, test it, discover what works (and what doesn’t work),
and then modify their idea based on this feedback. This cycle of 
developing ideas, testing them, and refining them is an essential 
part of the creative process. Thomas Edison, recipient of a record
1,093 patents, including the patents for the phonograph and the
light bulb, once said the real measure of success is the number of 
experiments that one can squeeze into 24 hours.
Beware of Faulty Assumptions
One of the most dangerous assumptions that innovative entrepre-
neurs can make is that customers are as excited about their innova-
tions as they themselves are. Like Edison, successful innovators see 
the pathway to entrepreneurship as a series of experiments. One 
of the most valuable experiments an entrepreneur can undertake is 
to get feedback from potential customers. Confirmation of an idea 
tells an entrepreneur that he or she is on the right track; conversely, 
lukewarm or negative customer feedback suggests that he or she 
drop the idea and move to another, more promising one. Andrew 
Hargadon, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship at the Uni-
versity of California, Davis, recalls a student entrepreneur who had
developed a novel pathology device. Part of her feedback cycle 
included talking with surgeons, whose response was overwhelm-
ingly positive and gave her the confidence to pursue commercializ-
ing the device. Her conversations with the surgeons also produced 
several suggestions for improvement that she had not thought of.
Innovators, says one writer, are “figure-outers.” When faced 
with problems and opportunities, they figure out how to deal with 
them successfully and in the process create innovations.

creative process.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
6. Verification
7. Implementation
Step 1. Preparation
This step involves getting the mind ready for creative thinking. Preparation might include a 
formal education, on-the-job training, work experience, and other learning opportunities. This
training provides a foundation on which to build creativity and innovation. As one writer ex-
plains, “Creativity favors the prepared mind.”84 For example, Dr. Hamel Navia, a scientist at 
tiny Vertex Pharmaceuticals, was working on a promising new drug to fight the AIDS virus. His 
preparation included earning an advanced degree in the field of medicine and learning to use
computers to create three-dimensional images of the protein molecules he was studying.85 How 
can you prepare your mind for creative thinking?
● Adopt the attitude of a lifelong student. Realize that educating yourself is a never-ending 
process. Look at every situation you encounter as an opportunity to learn.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tony Brennan: Sharklet Technologies Tony
Brennan, a materials science and engineering professor, was searching for a way to 
keep barnacles from clinging to ships’ hulls. He began studying sharkskin, which is known for
its ability to resist microbes, and discovered the key at a microscopic level: the diamond-
shaped pattern of tiny tooth-like outcroppings that prevent microbes from sticking. Brennan’s
research led him to start Sharklet Technologies, a company in Aurora, Colorado, that makes 
a sharkskin-inspired, micropatterned fabric called SafeTouch that resists the growth of bacte-
ria, including staph, e. coli, and MRSA. It can be applied to almost any high-touch surface. 
Sharklet is selling SafeTouch to hospitals, labs, research centers, and owners of public spaces 
that are prone to high concentrations of bacteria. The company recently landed a $2 million
investment from Altria Ventures, a venture capital firm.86 ■
● Read—a lot—and not just in your field of expertise. Many innovations come from blend-
ing ideas and concepts from different fields in science, engineering, business, and the arts. 
Reading books, magazines, and papers covering a variety of subject matter is a great way 
to stimulate your creativity.
● Clip interesting articles and create a file for them. Over time, you will build a customized 
encyclopedia of information from which to draw ideas and inspiration.
● Take time to discuss your ideas with other people, including those who know little about 
it as well as experts in the field. Sometimes, the apparently simple questions that an “un-
knowledgeable” person asks lead to new discoveries and to new approaches to an old prob-
lem. Don Medoff breathed creativity into his Tucson, Arizona–based supplier of windows 
and doors by bringing in as consultants college students from the nearby University of 
Arizona. Medoff and his managers briefed teams of students on several of the company’s 
stickiest problems and asked them for ideas on how to solve them. The student teams 
created new packaging ideas for several products, developed new television commercials, 
and made suggestions for updating the company’s Web site. Medoff, who implemented 
most of the students’ ideas, says that their input has been “invaluable.” He is working with 
the university on other projects for students to tackle.87
● Join professional or trade associations and attend their meetings. There you have the 
chance to interact with others who have similar interests. Learning how other people have 
solved a particular problem may give you fresh insight into solving it.
● Develop listening skills. It’s amazing what you can learn if you take the time to listen to 
other people—especially those who are older and have more experience. Try to learn some-
thing from everyone you meet.
● Eliminate creative distractions. Interruptions from telephone calls, e-mails, and visitors can 
crush creativity. Allowing employees to escape to a quiet, interruption-free environment 
enhances their ability to be creative.

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
125
Step 2. Investigation
This step requires one to develop a solid understanding of the problem, situation, or decision at 
hand. To create new ideas and concepts in a particular field, an individual first must study the 
problem and understand its basic components. Creative thinking comes about when people make 
careful observations of the world around them and then investigate the way things work (or fail to 
work). For example, Dr. Navia and another scientist at Vertex had spent several years conducting 
research on viruses and on a protein that blocks a virus enzyme called protease. His exploration 
of the various ways to block this enzyme paved the way for his discovery.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Christopher Leamon and Endocyte After earning his
PhD in chemistry, Christopher Leamon began researching targeted anticancer therapy us-
ing molecules that tumors absorb as “Trojan horses” to deliver drugs that are lethal to them. Ini-
tially, Leamon had focused on the vitamin biotin, but after nine months of research and hard 
work, his experiment was a failure. One morning while sitting at the breakfast table with his wife, 
Leamon, a longtime cereal lover, was reading the ingredients on the nutrition panel of his box of 
Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes. One of the items, folic acid, caught his attention. Leamon dashed off to
the library and found a research paper on how folic acid enters a human cell and realized that this 
was the breakthrough that he had been seeking. Before long, Leamon had developed a technique
for attaching cancer drugs to folic acid so that they would be absorbed and enable cells to fight 
the disease in much the same way they battle infections. Leamon has licensed the promising 
therapy to a company called Endocyte, which plans to have drugs on the market within a few
years. Leamon says that although he has experienced “Eureka” moments in the lab, none was as 
significant as his folic acid breakthrough. His encounter with a simple cereal box at breakfast
redefined his career and his life.88 ■
Step 3. Transformation
Transformation involves viewing the similarities and the differences among the information 
collected. This phase requires two types of thinking: convergent and divergent. Convergent 
thinking is the ability to see the similarities and the connections among various and often 
diverse data and events. “So much of innovation comes from connecting things where other 
people don’t make connections,” says Mark Rice, professor of technology entrepreneurship at 
Olin College.89
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Dominique Ansel:
Dominique Ansel Bakery Dominique Ansel, owner of
the bakery in New York City’s
Y
SoHo district that created the 
wildly popular Cronut, says he and his employees devote time 
every week to brainstorming new product and menu ideas.
“Finding a new idea is a lifestyle, not a moment,” he says. Ansel 
and his team identified the best features of two popular bakery
products, the croissant, with its layers of light crust, and the 
doughnut, which may include lush fillings or decadent toppings, 
or both, and combined them to create the Cronut. Making
Cronuts is a labor-intensive process that can take up to three
days. Because lines often form outside the bakery two-and-
a-half hours before it opens, Ansel has had to impose a two-
Cronut-per-person limit on in-store purchases and a six-Cronut 
limit on advance orders. Although Ansel has kept the price of
the Cronut at $5, some customers resell their Cronuts at mark-
ups of up to 950 percent.90 ■
Divergent thinking is the ability to see the differences
among various data and events. While developing his AIDS-
fighting drug, Dr. Navia studied the work of other scientists 
whose attempts at developing an enzyme-blocking drug had failed. He was able to see the simi-
larities and the differences in his research and theirs and to build on their successes while avoiding
their failures.

126
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
How can you increase your ability to transform the information collected into a purpose-
ful idea?
● Evaluate the parts of the situation several times, trying to grasp the “big picture.” Getting 
bogged down in the details of a situation too early in the creative process can diminish cre-
ativity. Look for patterns that emerge.
● Rearrange the elements of the situation. By looking at the components of an issue in a dif-f
ferent order or from a different perspective, you may be able to see the similarities and the
differences among them more readily. Rearranging them also may help uncover a familiar 
pattern that had been masked by an unfamiliar structure. After graduating with a degree in 
physics from Bowling Green University, Jerry Barber spent most of his career designing 
rides for amusement parks and eventually started his own company, Venture Ride Manu-
facturing, which he operated for 18 years before selling it. The holder of 51 patents,
Barber’s most famous amusement park invention is the “free fall” ride, such as Disney’s 
Tower of Terror. One day, after visiting with a friend who was delivering an enormous
gearbox for a wind turbine, Barber began to think about creating a more efficient wind
turbine. Drawing on his knowledge of a Ferris wheel’s design, Barber eliminated the need 
for a complex gearbox and rearranged other turbine components to create the innovative
WindWheel. A unique structural ring supports the five-blade turbine that turns with a 
slower, more efficient rotation, which dramatically reduces the level of noise pollution and 
makes the turbine more cost effective to operate. Barber’s design also includes blades that 
come in sections, allowing for much easier highway transport.91
● Try using synectics (a term derived from the Greek words for “to bring together” and
“diversity”), taking two seemingly nonsensical ideas and combining them. For instance,
why not launch a bookstore with no physical storefront and no books—an accurate descrip-
tion of what Jeff Bezos did when he came up with the idea for Amazon.com.92
● Before locking into one particular approach to a situation, remember that several approaches 
might be successful. If one approach produces a dead end, don’t hesitate to jump quickly 
to another. Considering several approaches to a problem or opportunity simultaneously 
would be like rolling a bowling ball down each of several lanes in quick succession. The 
more balls you roll down the lanes, the greater is the probability of hitting at least one 
strike. Resist the temptation to make snap judgments on how to tackle a problem or oppor-
tunity. The first approach may not be the best one.
Step 4. Incubation
The subconscious needs time to reflect on the information collected. To an observer, this phase 
of the creative process would be quite boring; it looks as though nothing is happening! In fact, 
during this phase, it may appear that the creative person is loafing. Incubation occurs while 
the individual is away from the problem, often engaging in some totally unrelated activity. 
Dr. Navia’s creative powers were working at a subconscious level even when he was away from 
his work, not even thinking about his research on AIDS-fighting drugs.
How can you enhance the incubation phase of the creative process, letting ideas marinate in 
your mind?
● Walk away from the situation. Time away from a problem is vital to enhancing creativity. 
A study by Wilson Brill, an expert on creativity, of how 350 great ideas became success-
ful products shows that two-thirds of the ideas came to people while they were away from 
work—in the shower, in their cars, in bed, on a walk, and in other nonwork situations.93
Doing something totally unrelated to the problem gives your subconscious mind the chance
to work on the problem or opportunity. Greg and Meredith Tally own the Best Western 
Southwest, a hotel in Denver located near Dinosaur Ridge, a famous site where paleon-
tologists found the first fossils of several species of dinosaurs, including the stegosaurus, 
the allosaurus, and other large sauropods. The copreneurs were about to embark on a 
major renovation of their 112-room hotel. While on a fossil hunting expedition, Dave, 
a science and fossil enthusiast, had an idea: Rather than do a generic remodel, why not 
turn their hotel into an extension of the nearby Morrison Museum of Natural History? 

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
127
In addition to a heated indoor pool (decorated with a mosaic of the creatures in a Creta-
ceous Period sea by famous dinosaur artist Larry Felder), the Tallys’ renovation includes
fossil displays from Dinosaur Ridge and the Morrison Museum (“They have way more 
stuff than they could ever show,” Greg says), museum-like exhibits, and life-size models 
of dinosaurs. “I could not think of a more unique differentiator than the history of 
Dinosaur Ridge,” Greg says.94
● Take the time to daydream. Although it may look as if you’re doing nothing, daydreaming
k
is an important part of the creative process. That’s when your mind is most free from self-
imposed restrictions on creativity. Research shows a connection between daydreaming and 
creativity; people who daydream are better at generating new ideas.95 Feel free to let your 
mind wander, and it may just stumble onto a creative solution. Recent research shows that 
daydreaming is one sign of a well-equipped and active brain. Although daydreaming ap-
pears to be a passive activity, it actually keeps the brain in a highly engaged state in which 
it can make insightful connections and discover brilliant insights.96
● Relax—and play—regularly. Perhaps the worst thing you can do for creativity is to work 
on a problem or opportunity constantly. Soon enough, fatigue walks in, and creativity 
walks out! Great ideas often are incubated on the golf course, on the basketball court, 
on a hiking trail, in the hammock, or in a bar.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Kazuhide Sekiyama: Spiber Inc. During an all-
night drinking session that included an in-depth conversation about “bug technol-
ogy,” Kazuhide Sekiyama began working to develop a man-made thread that mimics spider 
web—soft and flexible, yet amazingly strong given its small diameter. In fact, real spider
thread is one of nature’s miracles; it can stretch 40 percent beyond its original length without
breaking and is so strong that a spider web made of strands as thick as a pencil could stop a
jumbo jet in flight. Using biomimicry, Sekiyama eventually created an artificial spider thread 
called Qmonos (“spider web” in Japanese) that he claims is equal to steel in tensile strength 
with the flexibility of rubber. He created a company, Spiber Inc., to produce and market 
Spiber Web, which could make lighter, stronger products in many fields, including auto parts, 
surgical materials, and bulletproof vests.97 ■
● Dream about the problem or opportunity. “Dreams have been responsible for two Nobel 
prizes, the invention of a couple of major drugs, other scientific discoveries, several impor-
tant political events, and innumerable novels, films, and works of visual art,” says Harvard 
Medical School psychologist Deirdre Barrett.98 Although you may not be able to dream 
on command, thinking about an issue just before you drift off to sleep can be an effective
way to encourage your mind to work on it while you sleep, a process called lucid dream-
ing. Barrett’s research suggests that about 50 percent of people can focus their dreams 
by contemplating a particular problem before they go to sleep, in essence “seeding” the 
subconscious to influence their dreams.99 The idea for Chris and Kella McPhee’s busi-
ness, Suburban Camping, came to Chris after he dreamed that he had created elaborate and 
unique backyard campouts for birthday parties and summer activities. The McPhees, both 
of whom are camping enthusiasts, used $15,000 of their savings to start their business. 
They have invested in a line of customized tents and now offer camping events with a vari-
ety of themes, including a Harry Potter campout, a girls night out package, a romantic eve-
ning, a movie night, and others. Prices range from $80 to $500, and the McPhees already 
are planning to expand beyond their New Jersey base and into beach camping.100
● Work on the problem or opportunity in a different environment—somewhere other than
the office. Take your work outside on a beautiful fall day or sit on a bench in a mall. The
change of scenery will likely stimulate your creativity.
Step 5. Illumination
This phase of the creative process occurs at some point during the incubation stage when a spon-
taneous breakthrough causes “the light bulb to go on.” It may take place after five minutes—or 
five years. “An insight is an unexpected shift in the way we understand things,” says Gary Klein,
a clinical psychologist and author. “It comes without warning. It’s not something that we think is 

128
SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
going to happen. It feels like a gift, and, in fact, it is.”101 In the illumination stage, all the previous 
stages come together to produce the “Eureka factor”—the creation of the innovative idea. In one
study of 200 scientists, 80 percent said at least once a solution to a problem had “just popped into 
their heads”—usually when they were away from the problem.102 For Dr. Navia, the illumination 
stage occurred one day while he was reading a scientific journal. As he read, Dr. Navia says he 
was struck with a “hallucination” of a novel way to block protease.
Although the creative process itself may last for months or even years, the suddenness with
which the illumination step occurs can be deceiving, making the process appear to occur much 
faster than it actually does. One night, Kent Murphy, an electrical engineer, began dreaming
about what it would be like to be a photon of light. “I was riding a ray of light moving through the
fiber,” he recalls about his dream. Murphy, who holds 30 patents, used the insight from his dream 
to invent a fiber-optic gauge that monitors on a real-time basis the structural wear in airplanes.103
Step 6. Verification
For entrepreneurs, validating an idea as realistic and useful may include conducting experiments, 
running simulations, test-marketing a product or service, establishing small-scale pilot programs, 
building prototypes, and many other activities designed to verify that the new idea will work and 
is practical to implement. The goal is to subject the innovative idea to the test of cold, hard reality. 
At this phase, appropriate questions to ask include the following:
● Is it really a better solution to a particular problem or opportunity? Sometimes an idea that 
appears to have a bright future in the lab or on paper dims considerably when put to the test 
of reality.
● Will it work?
● Is there a need for it?
● If so, what is the best application of this idea in the marketplace?
● Does this product or service idea fit into our core competencies?
● How much will it cost to produce or to provide?
● Can we sell it at a reasonable price that will produce adequate sales, profit, and return on 
investment for our business?
● Will people buy it? Tom Ellingson and Dean Curtis, cofounders of Fandeavor, a business 
that helps sports fans’ dreams come true (e.g., locker room and sideline access at a profes-
sional football game, tickets for pit row and meet-and-greet drivers at a NASCAR race, and
others), kept their jobs at Zappos while they tested their business on a small scale. Fans
responded enthusiastically to their business model and less than a year after starting 
Fandeavor, Ellingson and Curtis left Zappos and made their company (in which Zappos 
CEO Tony Hsieh invested $525,000) their full-time career.104
To test the value of his new drug formulation, Dr. Navia used powerful computers at Vertex 
Pharmaceuticals to build three-dimensional Tinkertoy-like models of the HIV virus and then 
simulated his new drug’s ability to block the protease enzyme. Subsequent testing of the drug 
verified its safety. Dr. Navia was convinced he had an insight into solving the AIDS puzzle that 
no one else had discovered.
Step 7. Implementation
The focus of this step is to transform the idea into reality. Plenty of people come up with creative 
ideas for promising new products or services, but most never take them beyond the idea stage. 
What sets entrepreneurs apart is that they act on their ideas. An entrepreneur’s philosophy is
t
“Ready, aim, fire,” not “Ready, aim, aim, aim, aim.” Innowattech, a company based in Ra’anana, 
Israel, has developed a variety of piezoelectric (PE) crystals that possess the ability to transform 
vibrations, motion, and temperature changes into clean energy. Like miniature generators, the 
pressure-sensitive ceramic crystals give off small electrical charges when “squeezed, squashed, 
bent, or slapped,” says Markys Cain, a materials scientist. In a recent test, Innowattech placed

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
129
PE generators two inches beneath a small section of Israel’s busy Highway 4, where passing cars
compressed the road, activated the tiny generators, and produced energy. The company estimates 
that placing the PE crystals under a one-half-mile stretch of highway would generate enough 
energy to supply 250 homes. Innowattech also has developed crystals for collecting clean energy 
from railways, airport runways, and pedestrian walkways. Pavegen Systems, a London-based 
company, has developed a similar technology for pedestrian walkways that captures the kinetic 
energy from passersby. Installed on a busy thoroughfare, the company’s energy-absorbing pads 
(which are made from recycled material) can generate enough energy to power the area’s lighting 
and signs.105 The key to both companies’ success is their ability to take a creative idea for a useful 
new product and turn it into a reality. As one creativity expert explains, “Becoming more creative 
is really just a matter of paying attention to that endless flow of ideas you generate, and learning 
to capture and act upon the new that’s within you.”106
For Dr. Navia and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the implementation phase required testing the 
drug’s ability to fight the deadly virus in humans. If it proved to be effective, Vertex would 
complete the process by bringing the drug to market. In this final phase of testing, Navia was so
certain he was on the verge of a major breakthrough in fighting AIDS that he couldn’t sleep at 
night. Unfortunately, the final critical series of tests proved that Dr. Navia’s flash of creativity 
proved to be incorrect. Although his intuition proved to be wrong this time, Dr. Navia’s research 
into fighting AIDS continues. Much of the current work at Vertex is based on Dr. Navia’s original 
idea. Although it proved to be incorrect, his idea has served a valuable purpose: generating new 
ideas for HIV research.107
Techniques for Improving the Creative Process
Teams of people working together usually can generate more and more creative ideas. Five tech-
niques that are especially useful for improving the quality of creative ideas from teams are brain-
storming, mind mapping, force-field analysis, TRIZ, and rapid prototyping.
Brainstorming
Brainstorming is a process in which a small group of people interact with very little structure 
with the goal of producing a large quantity of novel and imaginative ideas. The goal is to cre-
ate an open, uninhibited atmosphere that allows members of the group to “freewheel” ideas. 
Participants should suggest any ideas that come to mind without evaluating or criticizing them. 
As group members interact, each idea sparks the thinking of others, and the spawning of ideas 
becomes contagious. The free-flowing energy generated by the team becomes the genesis of a 
multitude of ideas, some of which may be impractical; however, those impractical ideas may lead 
to one idea that results in a breakthrough product or service for a company. For a brainstorming
session to be successful, entrepreneurs should follow these guidelines:
● Keep the group small—just five to eight members. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos uses the 
“two-pizza rule”—if a brainstorming group can eat two pizzas, it’s too big.108
● Make the group as diverse as possible. Include people with different backgrounds, disci-
plines, and perspectives. At Joe Design Inc., every employee in the small firm takes part in 
brainstorming sessions. “We bring in everybody from the bookkeeper to the office manager 
because they see things completely differently than we do,” says cofounder Joe Raia.109
● Encourage participants to engage in some type of aerobic exercise before the session. One
study found that people who exercise—walking, bicycling, swimming, or running—before 
brainstorming sessions were more creative than those who did not exercise.110
● Ignore company rank and department affiliation. Every member of the brainstorming team
is on equal ground.
● Give the group a well-defined problem. Stating the problem in the form of a “why,” “how,”
or “what” question often helps.
● Rather than waste precious group meeting time getting participants up to speed, provide 
everyone involved in the session with relevant background material about the problem to

be solved beforehand. Invite participants to submit at least three ideas by e-mail before the 
brainstorming session takes place. This gets people’s minds focused on the issue.
● Limit the session to 40 to 60 minutes. Beyond that, participants grow weary, and creativity 
flags because brainstorming is an intense activity.
● Take a field trip. Visit the scene of the problem, if possible. Research shows that brain-
storming teams that go “on site” actually come up with more and better ideas.111
● Appoint someone (preferably not a brainstorming participant) the job of recorder. The 
recorder should write every idea on a flip chart or board so that everyone can see it.
● Use a seating pattern that encourages communication and interaction (e.g., circular or 
U-shaped arrangements).
● Throw logic out the window. The best brainstorming sessions are playful and anything but 
logical.
● Encourage all ideas from the team, even wild and extreme ones. Discourage participants
l
from editing their ideas. Not only can ideas that initially seem crazy get the group’s cre-
ative juices flowing, but they also can spread creativity like wildfire. In addition, the group 
often can polish some of these wild ideas into practical, creative solutions.
● Establish a goal of quantity of ideas over quality of ideas. There will be plenty of time later 
to evaluate the ideas generated. At Ideo Inc., a Silicon Valley design firm, brainstorming 
teams shoot for at least 150 ideas in a 30- to 45-minute session.112 When chemist Linus
Pauling received his second Nobel Prize, someone asked him how he came up with so
many great ideas. Pauling replied simply, “I come up with lots of ideas.”113
● Forbid evaluation or criticism of any idea during the brainstorming session. No idea is a
d
bad idea. Criticism slams the brakes on the creative process instantly!
● Encourage participants to use “idea hitchhiking,” building new ideas on those already 
suggested. Often, some of the best solutions are those that are piggybacked on others.
● Dare to imagine the unreasonable. Creative ideas often arise when people suspend conven-
tional thinking to consider far-fetched solutions.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John Nottingham: Nottingham Spirk At Nottingham 
Spirk, an industrial design firm whose success depends on the creativity of its people, em-
ployees routinely use brainstorming to come up with new product ideas and designs. The focus of 
these sessions is to generate a large quantity of ideas, “from mild to wild,” says cofounder John 
Nottingham, rather than to emphasize the quality of the ideas. By the end of the session, the walls 
are covered with pieces of paper containing scribbles, sketches, and notes, representing 100 or 
more ideas. Only after the brainstorming session do employees begin to focus on the quality of
the ideas generated. In these meetings, employees judge each idea using a simple scale. Each 
person can display one of three cards: “Who Cares?” “Nice,” and “Wow!” (All participants display
their cards simultaneously.) A consensus of “Who Cares?” cards means that the group discards the
idea, but a strong showing of “Wow!” cards means that the idea moves forward for refinement. 
A vote of “Nice” usually means that the idea goes back for more brainstorming, hopefully trans-
forming it into a “Wow!” idea. An idea for a Christmas tree stand that uses a swivel joint and a
locking pedal initially received a “Nice” rating from the group. The idea’s champion kept tinker-
ing with it, ultimately adding a self-regulating automatic watering device and other features be-
fore returning to the group. In its second pass, the idea went from “Nice” to “Wow!” Since 2002, 
the SwivelStraight tree stand has sold 1 million units.114 ■
Mind Mapping
Another useful tool for jump-starting creativity is mind mapping, an extension of brainstorming.
One strength of mind mapping is that it reflects the way the brain actually works. Rather than 
throwing out ideas in a linear fashion, the brain jumps from one idea to another. In many creative 
sessions, ideas are rushing out so fast that many are lost if a person attempts to shove them into a 
mind mapping
a graphical technique that 
encourages thinking on 
both sides of the brain, 
visually displays the various 
relationships among ideas, 
and improves the ability 
to view a problem from 
many sides.

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
131
linear outline. Creativity suffers. Mind mapping is a graphical technique that encourages thinking 
on both sides of the brain, visually displays the various relationships among ideas, and improves
the ability to view a problem from many sides.
The mind-mapping process works this way:
● Start by writing down or sketching a picture symbolizing the problem or area of focus in 
the center of a large blank page. Tony Buzan, originator of the mind-mapping technique, 
suggests using ledger paper or covering an entire wall with butcher paper to establish a 
wide-open attitude toward creativity.
● Write down every idea that comes into your mind, connecting each idea to the central pic-
ture or words with a line. Use key words and symbols to record ideas in shorthand. Work 
as quickly as possible for no more than 20 minutes, doing your best to capture the tide of 
ideas that flows from your brain. Just as in brainstorming, do not judge the quality of your 
ideas; just get them onto the paper. Build new ideas on the backs of existing ones. If you 
see a connection between a new idea and one already on the paper, connect them with a 
line. If not, simply connect the idea to the center symbol. You will organize your ideas later 
in the process.
● When the flow of ideas slows to a trickle, stop! Don’t try to force creativity.
● Allow your mind to rest for a few minutes and then begin to integrate the ideas on the page 
into a mind map. Use colored pens and markers to connect ideas with similar themes or to 
group ideas into related clusters. As you organize your thoughts, look for new connections 
among your ideas. Sometimes the brain needs time to process the ideas in a mind map. 
(Recall the incubation stage of the creative process.) Walking away from the mind map 
and the problem for a few minutes or a few hours may lead to several new ideas or to new 
relationships among ideas. One entrepreneur created the format for his company’s business
plan with a mind map rather than with a traditional linear outline. When he finished, he not 
only knew what he should include in his plan but also had a clear picture of the order in 
which to sequence the elements.
Force-Field Analysis
Force-field analysis is a useful technique for evaluating the forces that support and oppose a 
proposed change. It allows entrepreneurs to weigh both the advantages and the disadvantages of 
a particular decision and work to maximize the variables that support it and minimize those that 
work against it. The process, which, like brainstorming, works well with a group, begins by mak-
ing three columns and listing the problem to be addressed in the center column. In the column 
on the left, the group should list driving forces, those that support the issue and move it forward. 
In the column on the right, the group should list the restraining forces, those that hold back the 
company from implementing the idea. The specific forces that the group may come up with are 
almost limitless, but some of the factors the team should consider include people, values, costs,
trends, traditions, politics, costs, revenues, environmental impact, regulations, and attitudes.
Once the group has identified a reasonable number of driving and restraining forces (4 to
10 is typical), the next task is to assign a numerical value that reflects the strength of that par-
ticular force. For the driving forces column, scores range from 1 (weak) to 4 (strong), and in the
restraining forces column, scores range from −1 (weak) to −4 (strong). Adding the scores for 
the driving forces column and the restraining forces column shows which set of forces dominates 
the issue. The higher the total score, the more feasible is the idea. If the decision is a “go,” the 
group can focus on ideas to create new driving forces, strengthen existing driving forces, and 
minimize the impact of restraining forces.
Force-field analysis produces many benefits, particularly when it is combined with other cre-
ativity enhancing techniques. It helps entrepreneurs judge the practicality of a new idea, identify 
resources the company can use to bring the idea to market, recognize obstacles the company must 
overcome to implement the idea, and suggest ways to conquer those obstacles.
Figure 3.4 shows a sample force-field analysis for a small liberal arts college that is consider-
ing an entrepreneurial venture, launching a pharmacy school.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
TRIZ
Developed in 1946 by Genrich Altshuller, a 22-year-old naval officer in the former Soviet Union,
TRIZ (pronounced “trees”) is a systematic approach designed to help solve any technical prob-
lem, whatever its source. The name is derived from the acronym for the Russian phrase that trans-
lates as “theory of inventive problem solving.” Unlike brainstorming and mind mapping, which 
are right-brain activities, TRIZ is a left-brain, scientific, step-by-step process that is based on the 
study of hundreds of the most innovative patents across the globe. Altshuller claimed that these
innovations followed a particular set of patterns. Unlocking the principles behind those patterns 
allows one not only to solve seemingly insurmountable problems but also to predict where the 
next challenges would arise.
Altshuller and his colleagues developed 40 principles underlying these innovative patents 
and then developed the “TRIZ contradiction matrix,” a tool that combines these principles to 
solve a problem. They recognized that innovations come about when someone is able to over-
come the inherent contradictions in a process. For instance, in the packaging industry, a contra-
diction exists between the effectiveness of childproof safety caps for medicine containers and 
making those containers easy for authorized users to open. Manufacturers of mattresses face the
contradiction of making mattresses that are both hard and soft. Too often, companies rely on a 
very unimaginative solution to contradictions such as these; they compromise. Rather than settle
for a mediocre compromise, the TRIZ contradiction matrix is designed to resolve these conflicts
using the 40 principles that Altshuller developed. One axis of the matrix displays the character-
istic of the process to be improved, and the other axis displays the conflicting characteristic that 
is becoming worse.
For example, suppose that a candy maker wants to make syrup-filled, bottle-shaped choco-
lates by molding the chocolate bottles and then pouring syrup into the mold. To speed produc-
tion of the finished product to meet demand, the business owner tries heating the syrup to allow 
for faster pouring, but the heated syrup melts the molded chocolate bottles and distorts their 
shape (the contradiction; see Figure 3.5). Using the TRIZ contradiction matrix, the candy maker 
recognizes the problem as a conflict between speed and shape. Speed is the characteristic to be 
improved, and shape is the characteristic that is getting worse. The principles that the matrix sug-
gests for solving this problem include (1) changing the dynamics of the object or the environment 
(e.g., making a rigid part flexible), (2) discarding or recovering parts of an object (e.g., dis-
solving a protective case when it is no longer needed), (3) causing an object to vibrate or oscillate 
(e.g., transforming a standard knife into an electric knife by introducing oscillating blades), and
(4) changing the properties of the object (e.g., freezing the chocolate syrup and then molding the
bottles around the syrup).

Choosing principle 4, the candy maker decides to change the properties of the chocolate 
syrup by adding a compound that causes it to solidify when exposed to air, making it easier and 
faster to coat with chocolate. Once enclosed inside the chocolate, the syrup once again becomes 
a liquid. Problem solved!115
Rapid Prototyping
Generating creative ideas is a critical step in the process of taking an idea for a product or a ser-
vice successfully to market. However, recall that many (perhaps most) ideas that entrepreneurs 
come up with fail. Inventor and serial entrepreneur Scott Jones says his kids still enjoy teasing 
him about one of his offbeat ideas that flopped: a pair of microturbines embedded in the soles of 
shoes that would propel the wearer forward. (Jones abandoned the idea after seeing a similar con-
cept fail flamboyantly in the movie Jackass.)116 Rapid prototyping plays an important part in the 
creative process because it serves as a way to screen ideas that are not practical or just won’t work 
so that entrepreneurs can focus their creative energy on other ideas. The premise behind rapid 
prototyping is that transforming an idea into an actual model points out flaws in the original idea 
and leads to improvements in its design. “If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is 
worth ten thousand,” says Steve Vassallo of Ideo Inc.117

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
The three principles of rapid prototyping are the three Rs: rough, rapid, and right. Models do
not have to be perfect; in fact, in the early phases of developing an idea, perfecting a model usu-
ally is a waste of time. The key is to make the model good enough to determine what works and 
what does not. Doing so allows an entrepreneur to develop prototypes rapidly, moving closer to a 
successful design with each iteration. The final R, right, means building lots of small models that 
focus on solving particular problems with an idea. “You’re not trying to build a complete model,” 
says Vassallo. “You’re just focusing on a small section of it.”118
Intellectual Property: Protecting Your Ideas
Once entrepreneurs come up with innovative ideas for a product or service that has market poten-
tial, their immediate concern should be to protect them from unauthorized use. Counterfeit goods 
pose a real threat to businesses that have created intellectual property and their customers who 
use the products based on that intellectual property. The World Trade Organization estimates that 
between 5 and 7 percent of all goods traded globally are counterfeit.119 Research by the Interna-
tional Chamber of Commerce concludes that the value of counterfeit goods sold globally exceeds 
$1.7 trillion.120 Table 3.2 lists the top 10 counterfeit goods seized by U.S. Customs agents. China 
is the origin of 68 percent of the counterfeit goods seized in the United States.121
For many businesses, the value of their intellectual property exceeds the value of their tan-
gible assets. Entrepreneurs must understand how to protect their intellectual property using three 
common tools—patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
Patents
A patent is a grant from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to the inventor of a product, 
giving the exclusive right to make, use, or sell the invention (and to prevent others from mak-
ing, using or selling it) in this country for 20 years from the date of filing the patent application.
The purpose of giving an inventor a 20-year monopoly over a product is to stimulate creativity
and innovation. After 20 years, the patent expires and cannot be renewed, and the invention be-
comes part of the public domain. The popular Keurig single-cup coffee machine is protected by 
37 patents, but two of its most crucial patents expired in 2012, opening the door for competitors 
to introduce their own versions of the device.122
Most patents are granted for new product inventions (called utility patents), but design pat-
ents, extending for 14 years beyond the date the patent is issued, are given to inventors who make 
new, original, and ornamental changes in the design of existing products that enhance their sales.

135
Inventors who develop a new plant can obtain a plant patent, provided that they can reproduce 
the plant asexually (e.g., by grafting or crossbreeding rather than planting seeds). To be patented, 
a device must be new (but not necessarily better!), not obvious to a person of ordinary skill or 
knowledge in the related field, and useful. A device cannot be patented if it has been publicized
t
in print anywhere in the world or if it has been used or offered for sale in this country prior to
the date of the patent application. A U.S. patent is granted only to the true inventor, not a person 
who discovers another’s invention, and is effective only in the United States and its territories. 
(In 2011, Congress passed the America Invents Act that changed the “first to invent” rule for-
merly in place to “first to file,” which means that a patent goes to the first person to file a patent 
application.) Inventors who want to sell their inventions abroad must file for patents in each 
country in which they plan to do business. Once a product is patented, no one can copy or sell it 
without getting a license from its creator. A patent does not give one the right to make, use, or sell 
an invention but rather the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling it.
Although inventors are never assured of getting a patent, they can enhance their chances by 
following the basic steps suggested by the PTO. Before beginning the often lengthy and involved 
procedure, inventors should obtain professional assistance from a patent practitioner—a patent 
attorney or a patent agent—who is registered with the PTO. Only those attorneys and agents who 
are officially registered may represent an inventor seeking a patent. A list of registered attorneys 
and agents is available at the PTO’s Web site. Approximately 98 percent of all inventors rely on 
these patent experts to steer them through the convoluted process. Legal fees for filing a patent 
application range from $4,000 to $25,000, depending on the complexity of the product.
THE PATENT PROCESS Since George Washington signed the first patent law in 1790, the PTO 
(www.uspto.gov) has issued patents on everything imaginable (and some unimaginable items, 
too), including mouse traps (of course!), Robert Fulton’s steamboat, animals (genetically
engineered mice), Thomas Edison’s light bulb, golf tees (764 different patents), games, and
various fishing devices. The J. M. Smucker Company even holds a patent issued in 1999 on a
“sealed, crustless sandwich,” a peanut butter and jelly sandwich it markets very successfully under 
the name “Uncrustables.”123 The PTO also has issued patents on business processes—methods 
of doing business—including Amazon.com’s controversial patent on its “1-Click” technology,
which allows users to store their customer information in a file and then recall it with one mouse 
click at checkout. Google recently received a patent for a system of “advertising based on 
environmental conditions.” The patent gives Google the exclusive right to use the technology to 
send targeted ads to users depending on the temperature, for example (e.g., ads for winter coats 
when the temperature dips into the 30s or rain gear when it rains).124 To date, the PTO has issued
nearly 9 million patents, and it receives more than 575,000 new applications and grants nearly 
250,000 patents each year (see Figure 3.6)!125 To receive a patent, an inventor must follow these steps:
Establish the invention’s novelty. An invention is not patentable if it is known or has been 
used in the United States or has been described in a printed publication in this or a foreign 
country.
Document the device. To protect their patent claims, inventors should be able to verify the 
date on which they first conceived the idea for their inventions. Inventors should document 
a device by keeping dated records (including drawings) of their progress on the invention 
and by having knowledgeable friends witness these records.
Search existing patents. To verify that the invention truly is new, not obvious, and use-
ful, an inventor must conduct a search of existing patents on similar products. The purpose 
of the search is to determine whether the inventor has a chance of getting a patent. Most 
inventors hire professionals trained in conducting patent searches to perform the research. 
Inventors themselves can conduct an online search of all patents granted by the PTO 
since 1976 from the office’s Web site. An online search of these patents does not include
sketches; however, subscribers to Delphion’s Research Intellectual Property Network can 
access patents, including sketches, as far back as 1971. Search engine Google also enables 
entrepreneurs to search patents at its “patents” site.
Study search results. Once the patent search is finished, inventors must study the results to 
determine their chances of getting a patent. To be patentable, a device must be sufficiently

different from what has been used or described before and must not be obvious to a person 
having ordinary skill in the area of technology related to the invention.
Complete a patent application. If an inventor decides to seek a patent, he or she must file an 
application describing the invention with the PTO. The patent application must include spe-
cific claims, which describe the invention—what it does and how it works—and any drawings
that are necessary to support the claims. The typical patent application runs 20 to 40 pages
although some, especially those for biotech or high-tech products, are tens of thousands of 
pages long. The longest patent application to date is one for a gene patent that was 6 million
pages long!126 Most inventors hire patent attorneys or agents to help them complete their pat-
ent applications. Figure 3.7 shows a portion of the application for a rather unusual patent.
Inventors also can file a provisional application for a patent for a small fee. Filing for a pro-
visional patent does not require the inventor to file any claims but does give him or her the 
right to use the phrase “patent pending” on the device. After filing for a provisional patent, 
an inventor has one year to file a standard patent application.
File the patent application. Before the PTO will issue a patent, one of its examiners 
studies the application to determine whether the invention warrants a patent. Approval of a
patent takes on average 27.5 months from the date of filing.127 If the PTO rejects the appli-
cation, the inventor can amend his or her application and resubmit it to the PTO.
Defending a patent against “copycat producers” can be expensive and time consuming but 
often is necessary to protect an entrepreneur’s interest. The number of patent infringement law-
suits has increased sharply. In 2009, patent holders filed 2,800 infringement suits; today, courts 
see nearly 5,200 patent suits per year. The median time for a patent infringement case to get to 
trial is 2.3 years. The median cost of a patent infringement lawsuit when the amount in dispute 
is between $1 million and $25 million is about $2.65 million if the case goes to trial (about 
95 percent of patent infringement lawsuits are settled out of court), but the odds of winning are 
in the patent holder’s favor. About two-thirds of patent holders win their infringement suits; since 
2007, the median award is $4.95 million, which is most often based on the royalties lost to the 
infringer.128 Canada Goose is a company started in 1957 in Toronto, Ontario, that manufactures 
high-quality, down-insulated vests and coats designed to protect people who wear the company’s 
products from the mind-numbing cold of Antarctica or the gale-force winds on the North Sea. 
Recently, Canada Goose managers discovered knockoffs of its products that look like the real 
items but contain no down insulation at all. Instead, the counterfeit garments, many of which are 
made in the Far East using child labor, are filled with unsanitary, bacteria-laden materials that

offer no protection against the elements. Halting sales of counterfeit items can be difficult, but 
CEO Dani Reiss, whose grandfather founded the company, says Canada Goose “employs legal 
teams all over the world to intercept [counterfeit] shipments.” Recently, Canada Goose was suc-
cessful in shutting down a business that was importing counterfeit jackets bearing its labels and
selling them to unsuspecting customers in Sweden. To verify the authenticity of its products, the 
company recently began adding a hologram to every jacket.129 With its global reach and speedy 
convenience, the Internet compounds the problem of counterfeit sales, especially among brand-
name products such as shoes, consumer electronics, handbags, apparel, watches, computers, and
others. Ninety-three percent of counterfeit goods originate in China and Hong Kong.130
Trademarks
A trademark is any distinctive word, phrase, symbol, design, name, logo, slogan, or trade dress 
that a company uses to identify the origin of a product or to distinguish it from other goods

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Companies in the fashion industry typically defend their trade-
marks aggressively but traditionally have not relied on patents to
protect their intellectual property because few legal protections
for clothing designs exist. Fashion designers constantly come up 
with new designs for garments but find that protecting, say, the
shape of a lapel or the cut of a cuff, is difficult because clothing 
is functional and not “novel, useful, and not obvious” in light
of current technology, which receiving a patent requires. Fashion
companies usually look to trademarks to protect their brands.
Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves Saint Laurent SA. French
luxury shoemaker Christian Louboutin (CL) recently filed a 
trademark infringement lawsuit against Yves Saint Laurent
(YSL), claiming that CL had the right to trademark protection 
for the “China red” soles the company uses on all of its high 
heel shoes and that YSL had violated its trademark by intro-
ducing a line of “monochrome” high heel shoes in which the 
red shoes had red soles. CL’s attorney argued that Louboutin’s 
use of the red soles had transformed an everyday item, the 
sole of a shoe, into a work of art and created a well-
recognized trademark. “The red sole has become synonymous 
with Christian Louboutin and high fashion,” the company 
pointed out in its complaint. “Louboutin turned a pedestrian 
item into a thing of beauty.” Celebrities such as Scarlett 
Johansson, Oprah Winfrey, Gwyneth Paltrow, Halle Berry, 
Beyoncé, Christina Aguilera, and many others, often sport
“Loubs.” CL also pointed out that other companies have
trademark protection for certain colors, such as Tiffany and 
Company’s robin-egg blue boxes, United Parcel Service’s brown 
trucks and uniforms, and Owens-Corning’s pink insulation.
Winning a trademark for color has proven to be more
difficult in the fashion industry, where color is a fundamental 
part of almost any design. That principle became the founda-
tion of YSL’s argument. YSL’s attorney countered by citing a 
judge’s ruling in a similar case that said, “Granting a pro-
ducer the exclusive use of a basic element of design (shape, 
material, color, and so forth) impoverishes other designers’ 
palettes.” YSL went on to argue that “allowing Louboutin 
to claim a monopoly on the use of red on a part of the shoe 
would have an unprecedented, anti-competitive effect in
limiting the design options available to all other designers.”
After hearing the parties’ arguments, Judge Victor 
Marrero, a district court judge in New York, ruled in favor of 
Yves Saint Laurent. “Louboutin’s claim would cast a red cloud
over the whole industry, cramping what other designers could 
do while allowing Louboutin to paint with a full palette,“ he 
wrote. “Color constitutes a critical attribute of the goods.”
His ruling meant that Christian Louboutin could not claim 
trademark protection for its red-soled shoes. Attorneys for 
Christian Louboutin filed an appeal with the Second Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals with the intent of having the appeals 
court reverse the trial court’s decision.
Lulumon Athletica Inc. v. Calvin Klein Inc. Lulumon, a 
maker of yoga apparel based in Vancouver, British Columbia, 
filed a complaint in a district court in Delaware, claiming that 
Calvin Klein Inc. (CKI) was selling yoga pants that infringed 
on three of the company’s design patents, including one that 
included a distinctive waistband made of three overlapping 
panels of fabric that the company received in 2011. Unlike a 
utility patent, a design patent protects an item’s nonfunction-
al, ornamental features. To receive a design patent, a product 
must include the following five elements:
1. The item must be an “article of manufacture.”
2. The design must be original.
3. The design must be novel.
4. The design must be non-obvious.
5. The design must be ornamental.
With its three overlapping pieces of Lulumon’s trademarked Luon 
compression fabric, the waistband on the company’s Astro yoga
pants, which retail for $98, is designed to make the waist look 
slimmer and, because they can be rolled down to sit lower on 
the waist, enhance the wearer’s athletic performance. Lulumon 
claimed that the waistband on CKI’s yoga pants, which sell for as
little as $20, is substantially similar to the waistband on its Astro
yoga pants. According to a decision in 2008 by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, owners of design patents must 
prove that to the average observer the alleged infringer’s design 
appears to be substantially the same as its own design (known as
the “ordinary observer test”).
1. What does a trademark protect? What does a patent pro-
tect? What is a design patent?
2. Assume the role of a judge in these two cases. How would 
you rule? Explain your reasoning. (In the Lulumon Athletica 
v. Calvin Klein case, you may want to search online for im-
ages of the two companies’ yoga pants and apply the ordi-
nary observer test before making your decision.)
3. Use a search engine to research the outcomes of these two 
cases. How were the cases resolved? If a judge rendered a 
decision, summarize his or her reasoning. Do you agree with 
the judge’s decision?

on the market. (A service mark is the same as a trademark except that it identifies and distinguishes
the source of a service rather than a product.) A trademark serves as a company’s “signature” in 
the marketplace. A trademark can be more than just a company’s logo, slogan, or brand name; 
it can also include symbols, shapes, colors, smells, or sounds. For instance, Coca-Cola holds
a trademark on the shape of its bottle, and Owens-Corning has trademarked the unique pink 
color of its insulation. NBC owns a “sound mark,” the auditory equivalent of a trademark, on 
its three-toned chime, and MGM has similar protection on the roar of the lion (whose name 
is Leo) that appears at the beginning of its movies.131 Trademark infringement involves using
t
another company’s trademark without permission or using a mark that is so similar to another’s 
trademark that it is likely to create confusion about the origin of the goods. Trademark owners
file about 3,600 infringement lawsuits per year.132
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Heath Scurfield and Calli Baker’s Firehouse Bar & 
Grill Firehouse Subs, a chain of fast-food submarine sandwich shops with more than 
450 locations across the United States, filed a trademark infringement suit against Heath Scurfield, 
a retired firefighter who owns Calli Baker’s Firehouse Bar & Grill, claiming that his use of the word
“firehouse” in his company’s name was likely to confuse customers into believing that his restau-
rant was affiliated with the national chain. Scurfield argued that the only similarity between his 
independent, full-service restaurant, which features lunch and dinner entrees, a bar, and a cater-
ing service, and the Firehouse Subs chain is the inclusion of the word “firehouse” in their names 
and the firehouse decor. After three years of legal wrangling, a jury ruled in Scurfield’s favor and 
invalidated Firehouse Subs’ trademark because it filed a fraudulent trademark application in 
2003, claiming that at the time no other restaurants were using the word “firehouse” in their 
names when, in reality, the company knew that many restaurants included “firehouse” in their 
names. Firehouse Subs appealed the ruling, and the parties ultimately entered into a court-
approved settlement under which Scurfield would continue to use his company’s name and Fire-
house Subs would not renew its trademark and would pay all of Scurfield’s legal fees, which 
amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars.133 ■
Components of a product’s identity are part of its trade dress, the unique combination of ele-
ments that a company uses to create a product’s image and to promote it. For instance, a Mexican 
restaurant chain’s particular decor, color schemes, design, and overall “look and feel” constitute 
trade dress
the unique combination of 
elements that a company 
uses to create a product’s
image and to promote it.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
its trade dress. To be eligible for trademark protection, trade dress must be inherently unique and 
distinctive to a company, and another company’s use of that trade dress must be likely to confuse 
customers.
There are 1.88 million trademarks registered and in active use in the United States (see 
Figure 3.8).134 Federal law permits a company to register a trademark, which prevents other 
companies from employing a similar mark to identify their goods. Before 1989, a business could 
not reserve a trademark in advance of use. Today, the first party who either uses a trademark in
commerce or files an application with the PTO has the ultimate right to register that trademark.
Before attempting to register a trademark, an entrepreneur must conduct a search to verify that 
it is not already in use or is too similar to an existing mark. BizFilings’ Trademark Explorer is a 
handy, low-cost tool for conducting trademark searches. Registering a trademark takes an aver-
age of 10.3 months from the time an entrepreneur submits the application.135 Unlike patents and 
copyrights, which are issued for limited amounts of time, trademarks last indefinitely as long as 
the holder continues to use it. However, between 5 and 6 years after a trademark’s registration 
date (and again between 9 and 10 years after the registration date and every 10 years after that),
an entrepreneur must file an affidavit of use with the PTO. A trademark cannot keep competitors
from producing the same product or selling it under a different name; it merely prevents others
from using the same or confusingly similar trademark for the same or similar products.
Many business owners are confused by the use of the symbols ™ and ®. Anyone who claims
the right to a particular trademark (or service mark) or has filed a trademark application can use
the ™ (or SM) symbol. The claim to that trademark or service mark may or may not be valid, 
however. Only those businesses that have registered their marks with the PTO can use the 
d
® sym-
bol. Entrepreneurs do not have to register trademarks or service marks to establish their rights to 
those marks; however, registering a mark with the PTO does give entrepreneurs greater power 
to protect their marks. Filing an application to register a trademark or service mark costs from 
$275 to $375 and is relatively easy, but it does require a search of existing names.
An entrepreneur may lose the exclusive right to a trademark if it loses its unique character 
and becomes a generic name. Aspirin, escalator, thermos, brassiere, super glue, corn flakes, 
yo-yo, and cellophane all were once enforceable trademarks that have become common words in 
the English language. These generic terms can no longer be licensed as trademarks.

In 2004, Thomas Dempsey started a company, SylvanSport, in 
Brevard, North Carolina, to sell a unique recreational camper 
trailer he invented and patented. SylvanSport marketed the trailer 
as “more versatile than a Swiss army knife” because it folds into 
a trailer that can carry boats, bikes, and other gear and, once
onsite, convert in minutes into a camper with a self-inflating mat-
tress and tent. By 2011, the company’s annual sales had reached
$3 million, 15 percent of which came from outside the United 
States, particularly South Korea, Japan, and Australia. With inter-
national sales growth outpacing domestic sales growth, Dempsey
saw a bright future for his company.
Then he received an e-mail from a customer that included a
link to the Web site of a Chinese company, Wuyi Tiandi Motion 
Apparatus, that was selling a camper trailer almost identical to the 
one he had designed. “We were shocked,” says Dempsey. “We
thought at first that what we saw was our product, but we real-
ized that [their product] was created from scratch.”
Since then, several of Dempsey’s international distributors
in Asia have dropped SylvanSport’s camper and are selling the 
Chinese company’s product. A Japanese distributor mistakenly pur-
chased the Chinese company’s camper, thinking it was buying one 
of SylvanSport’s products. Thomas Tang, sales manager for Wuyi
Tiandi, admits that SylvanSport was the first company “to make 
this type of trailer, and we followed them to make a similar prod-
uct.” Although Wuyi Tiandi cannot sell its camper in the United
States because of SylvanSport’s patent, “we can still sell our trailer 
everywhere else [in the world],” says Tang. Dempsey is concerned 
about the sales his company has lost to its Chinese competi-
tor. “There’s a very real chance that the Chinese company could
be the survivor here and we could go out of business,” he says 
matter-of-factly.
Thomas Dempsey took the proper steps to protect his intel-
lectual property by securing a utility patent for his unique camper 
trailer in the United States. Like many entrepreneurs in today’s 
global economy, Dempsey is conducting business internationally, 
where his U.S. patent offers no protection. What lessons can en-
trepreneurs learn from Dempsey’s experience about protecting 
their intellectual property?
1. Recognize that intellectual property, the rights that 
result when a person uses his or her knowledge 
and creativity to produce something of value, can 
be a business’s most valuable asset, even for small 
companies. Often intellectual property is the source of a 
company’s competitive advantage. Experts estimate that in 
the United States alone, 30 to 40 percent of all gains in pro-
ductivity over the course of the twentieth century originated 
with intellectual property. The World Intellectual Property
Organization estimates that the value of the intellectual 
property of companies in the United States is $5.8 trillion.
2. Use the appropriate tool to file for protection of your 
intellectual property and do so promptly. The processes 
of filing for a patent, a trademark, and a copyright are dif-
ferent; make sure you know what each tool protects, which 
one is right for you, and how to get maximum protection 
from it for your intellectual property. You may be able to
apply for more than one type of protection. For instance, 
an entrepreneur may be able to trademark a company logo 
and, if it is a form of artistic expression, copyright it as well.
3. Use qualified, experienced intellectual property 
attorneys to gain the proper protection. The time to
involve attorneys in protecting the product of your knowl-
edge and creativity is before you have to bring them in to
take action against someone who has stolen your intellec-
tual property. Filing for patents, trademarks, and copyrights
can be intimidating if you have never done it before, and
doing it incorrectly may mean that you have no protec-
tion at all. Attorneys, consultants, examiners, and other
professionals specialize in the various types of intellectual
property protection. Use their expertise! They can refer you
to patent draftspeople (who create the sketches required
for a patent application), design engineers, manufacturers,
and others.
4. If you do business globally, register your company’s 
patents, trademarks, and copyrights in the countries 
in which you do business or that are a strategic part of 
your business. Once an entrepreneur has made the proper 
filings to protect his or her intellectual property in the United
States, the next step is to file for protection in the countries
in which the company does business and in countries that
are strategically important to the business. Only 15 percent
of companies that do business internationally realize that
U.S. patents and trademarks do not protect their intellectual
t
property outside the borders of the United States. Although
enforcing intellectual property laws in some countries can 
be difficult, the chances that you will be successful rise
significantly if you have registered your IP with the proper 
offices in those nations. Most nations grant patents and
trademarks to the first person or business to file. Inventors
file more than 2 million patent applications globally each 
year, and 2011 marked the first time that businesses and
entrepreneurs filed more patents in China than in any other
country in the world. Businesses also file more than 4 million
applications for trademarks globally each year.
Filing to protect intellectual property rights in many 
individual countries can be expensive and time-consuming. 
Fortunately, when applying for trademarks, entrepreneurs 
benefit from important shortcuts: international registration

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Copyrights
A copyright is an exclusive right that protects the creators of original works of authorship, such 
as literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works (e.g., art, sculptures, literature, software, music, 
videos, video games, choreography, motion pictures, recordings, and others). The internationally 
recognized symbol © denotes a copyrighted work. A copyright protects only the form in which 
an idea is expressed, not the idea itself. A copyright on a creative work comes into existence 
the moment its creator puts that work into a tangible form. Just as with a trademark, obtaining 
basic copyright protection does not require registering the creative work with the U.S. Copyright 
t
Office (www.copyright.gov).
Registering a copyright does give creators greater protection over their work, however. En-
trepreneurs must file copyright applications with the Copyright Office in the Library of Congress 
for a fee of $35 to $65 per application (plus recording fees). The mean processing time for a
copyright application is 94 days.136 A valid copyright on a work lasts for the life of the creator 
plus 70 years after his or her death. When a copyright expires, the work becomes public property 
and can be used by anyone free of charge.
Because they are so easy to duplicate, computer software programs, CDs, and DVDs are 
among the most often pirated items by copyright infringers. The Business Software Alliance 
estimates that the global software piracy rate is 42 percent and that the software industry loses 
$63.4 billion each year to pirates who illegally copy programs.137 The motion picture industry 
loses billions of dollars annually to those who forge counterfeit movies and sell them. Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement officials recently disabled nine Web sites that were selling down-
loads of pirated movies, in some cases just hours after the films premiered in theaters.138
Table 3.3 provides a summary of the characteristics of patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
Protecting Intellectual Property
Acquiring the protection of patents, trademarks, and copyrights is useless unless an entrepreneur 
takes action to protect those rights in the marketplace. Unfortunately, not every businessperson
respects others’ rights of ownership to products, processes, names, and works, and some infringe
on those rights with impunity. In other cases, the infringing behavior simply is the result of a 
and a community trademark. Entrepreneurs can file an in-
ternational registration in all 86 nations that participate in 
the Madrid Protocol with an application in their home 
nations that they extend to the other 85 nations (although 
they must pay a registration fee in each country). Entre-
preneurs who register a community trademark file a single
application and pay a single fee that grants trademark 
protection in all 28 countries that belong to the European 
Union. In 2007, the patent offices in the United States, the 
European Union, and Japan created a common patent ap-
plication that allows entrepreneurs to streamline the patent 
process by filing a single application for each country’s pat-
ent office.
5. Select your company’s business affiliates, especially 
suppliers, carefully. Companies in some countries have 
little concern for others’ intellectual property. Some sup-
pliers in foreign countries see no problem manufacturing 
goods for a business and then running an extra shift to 
produce the same goods that they themselves sell. In China, 
which is famous for its copycat culture, the term shanzai
describes companies’ tendency to copy the successful prod-
ucts of other businesses. Entrepreneurs should take extra 
precautions to ensure that they secure proper protection for
their intellectual property before forging relationships with 
foreign manufacturers, especially those in Asia.
6. Protect your rights vigorously. If you discover that some-
one is using your intellectual property without permission, 
pursue your rights vigorously. Recognize that the costs of 
taking legal action, especially in foreign lands, may out-
weigh the benefits, at least in the short run. Entrepreneurs 
must decide whether pursuing costly legal action to protect
their intellectual property rights will yield long-term benefits. 
A “head-in-the-sand” approach never works. After register-
ing their trademarks and filing for patents in foreign coun-
tries, entrepreneurs must monitor them carefully and avidly 
prosecute violators of their intellectual property rights.

lack of knowledge about others’ rights of ownership. After acquiring the proper legal protection
through patents, copyrights, or trademarks, entrepreneurs must monitor the market (and the Inter-
net in particular) for unauthorized copycat users. If an entrepreneur has a valid patent, trademark, 
or copyright, stopping an infringer usually requires nothing more than a stern “cease-and-desist”
letter from an attorney. Often, offenders don’t want to get into expensive legal battles and agree
to stop their illegal behavior. If that tactic fails, the entrepreneur may have no choice but to bring
an infringement lawsuit, most of which end up being settled out of court.
The primary weapon an entrepreneur has to protect patents, trademarks, and copyrights is 
the legal system. The major problem with relying on the legal system to enforce ownership rights, 
however, is the cost and time of infringement lawsuits, which can quickly exceed the budget of 
most small businesses and occupy huge blocks of managers’ time. Lawsuits always involve costs. 
Before pursuing what could become an expensive and drawn-out legal battle, an entrepreneur 
must consider the following issues:
● Can the opponent afford to pay if you win?
● Do you expect to get enough from the suit to cover the costs of hiring an attorney and pre-
paring a case?
● Can you afford the loss of time, money, and privacy from the ensuing lawsuit?

Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Explain the differences among creativity, 
innovation, and entrepreneurship.
● The entrepreneur’s “secret” for creating value in
the marketplace is applying creativity and innova-
tion to solve problems and to exploit opportunities 
people face every day. Creativity is the ability to 
develop new ideas and to discover new ways of 
looking at problems and opportunities. Innovation 
is the ability to apply creative solutions to those
problems and opportunities to enhance or to enrich 
people’s lives. Entrepreneurship is the result of a 
disciplined, systematic process of applying creativ-
ity and innovation to needs and opportunities in the 
marketplace.

SECTION I • THE CHALLENGE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
6. Describe the steps in the creative process.
● The creative process consists of seven steps: Step 1,
preparation, involves getting the mind ready for 
creative thinking; step 2, investigation, requires
the individual to develop a solid understanding of 
the problem or decision; step 3, transformation, 
involves viewing the similarities and the differences 
among the information collected; step 4, incuba-
tion, allows the subconscious mind to reflect on the 
information collected; step 5, illumination, occurs 
at some point during the incubation stage when a 
spontaneous breakthrough causes “the light bulb to 
go on”; step 6, verification, involves validating the
idea as accurate and useful; and step 7, implementa-
tion, involves transforming the idea into a business
reality.
7. Discuss techniques for improving the creative 
process.
● Five techniques are especially useful for improving 
the creative process:
● Brainstorming is a process in which a small 
group of people interact with very little structure 
with the goal of producing a large quantity of 
novel and imaginative ideas.
● Mind mapping is a graphical technique that 
encourages thinking on both sides of the brain, 
visually displays the various relationships among 
ideas, and improves the ability to view a problem 
from many sides.
● Force-field analysis allows entrepreneurs to 
weigh both the advantages and the disadvantages 
of a particular decision and work to maximize 
the variables that support it and minimize those 
that work against it.
● TRIZ is a systematic approach designed to help 
solve any technical problem, whatever its source.
Unlike brainstorming and mind mapping, which 
are right-brain activities, TRIZ is a left-brain, 
scientific, step-by-step process that is based on
the study of hundreds of the most innovative
patents across the globe.
● Rapid prototyping is based on the premise that 
transforming an idea into an actual model will 
point out flaws in the original idea and will lead 
to improvements in its design.
8. Describe the protection of intellectual 
property through patents, trademarks, 
and copyrights.
● A patent is a grant from the federal government that 
gives an inventor exclusive rights to an invention for 
20 years.
2. Describe why creativity and innovation are
such an integral part of entrepreneurship.
● Entrepreneurs must always be on guard against 
paradigms—preconceived ideas of what the world 
is, what it should be like, and how it should operate—
because they are logjams to creativity. Successful 
entrepreneurs often go beyond conventional wisdom
as they ask, “Why not?”
● Success—even survival—in this fiercely competi-
tive, global environment requires entrepreneurs to 
tap their creativity (and that of their employees) 
constantly.
3. Understand how the two hemispheres of the 
human brain function and what role they play 
in creativity.
● For years, people assumed that creativity was an 
inherent trait. Today, however, we know better. 
Research shows that almost anyone can learn to be 
creative. The left hemisphere of the brain controls 
language, logic, and symbols, processing informa-
tion in a step-by-step fashion. The right hemisphere 
handles emotional, intuitive, and spatial functions,
processing information intuitively. The right side of 
the brain is the source of creativity and innovation. 
People can learn to control which side of the brain 
is dominant in a given situation.
4. Explain the 10 “mental locks” that limit 
individual creativity.
The number of potential barriers to creativity is limit-
less, but entrepreneurs commonly face 10 “mental 
locks” on creativity: Searching for the one “right” 
answer, focusing on “being logical,” blindly following 
the rules, constantly being practical, viewing play as 
frivolous, becoming overly specialized, avoiding am-
biguity, fearing looking foolish, fearing mistakes and 
failure, and believing that “I’m not creative.”
5. Understand how entrepreneurs can enhance 
the creativity of their employees as well as 
their own creativity.
● Entrepreneurs can stimulate creativity in their 
companies by expecting creativity, expecting and 
tolerating failure, encouraging curiosity, viewing 
problems as challenges, providing creativity train-
ing, providing support, rewarding creativity, and 
modeling creativity.
● Entrepreneurs can enhance their own creativity by 
using the following techniques: allowing themselves 
to be creative, giving their minds fresh input every day, 
keeping a journal handy to record their thoughts and 
ideas, reading books on stimulating creativity or taking 
a class on creativity, and taking some time off to relax.

CHAPTER 3 • INSIDE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND: FROM IDEAS TO REALITY
145
● A copyright protects original works of authorship. It 
covers only the form in which an idea is expressed 
and not the idea itself and lasts for 70 years beyond 
the creator’s death.
● A trademark is any distinctive word, symbol, or 
trade dress that a company uses to identify its prod-
uct and to distinguish it from other goods. It serves 
as a company’s “signature” in the marketplace.

3-16. You have a business presentation at your client’s
office in five minutes and you just realized that you 
have left your presentation documents in your office. 
In order to maintain your reputation in front of your 
client, you will be required to tackle this problem 
with maximum creativity. Generate as many solu-
tions as possible by brainstorming with your busi-
ness partner(s). 
3-17. Work in a group of two or three students. Find an 
easily available product (for example, a pen). Think 
of all the creative ways the product can be used. You
need to prepare at least 10 alternative uses including
unconventional methods for that particular product. 
3-18. A Facebook group of more than 25,000 people is 
trying to convince Cadbury, the venerable British 
confectioner (now owned by Kraft Foods), to pro-
duce a giant chocolate Cadbury Crème Egg that 
contains a filling made from fondant that resembles 
the yolk and white of a real egg. (Currently, giant 
Cadbury chocolate eggs, which are about the size of 
an ostrich egg, are hollow, a great disappointment 
to fans of the company’s smaller chocolate eggs
that are filled with creamy white and yolk-colored 
fondant.) A Cadbury spokesman says that “creating 
a [chocolate] shell that is strong enough to contain 
the sheer weight of the fondant is technically chal-
lenging.” Use the creativity-enhancing techniques 
described in this chapter to develop potential solu-
tions that would allow Cadbury to manufacture a 
giant Crème Egg.
3-19. A major maker of breakfast cereals was about to in-
troduce a new multigrain cereal. Its principal selling 
point is that it features “three great tastes” in every 
bowl: corn, rice, and wheat. Because a cereal’s name 
is an integral part of its marketing campaign, the 
company hired a costly consulting firm to come up 
with the right name for the new product. The con-
sulting firm tackled the job using “a combination of 
structural linguistics and personal creativity.” One
year and many dollars later, the consulting firm gave 
its recommendation. Take 20 minutes to list names
that you think would be appropriate for this cereal. 
Make brief notes about why you think each name is 
appropriate. Your professor may choose to prepare a 
list of names from all the members of your class and 
may take a vote to determine the “winner.”

a DesignAid that contains 20 items, each with 
“unexpected properties,” as a way to stimulate inno-
vation and ideas for new products or services. One 
Inventables’ recent DesignAid package included the 
following items:
●Translucent concrete—concrete that contains 
thin layers of fiber optics, which create semi-
transparent stripes in the concrete.
●Sound-recording paper—A piece of cardboard-
like paper that records and plays sounds with 
the help of ultrathin electronics embedded in 
the page.
●Impact-absorbing silicon—Silicon that, despite 
being only one inch thick, absorbs impact, in-
cluding microvibrations. If you drop an egg on it, 
the egg won’t break.
●Wireless battery-free speakers—Solar-powered 
speakers receive sound via infrared waves rather 
than radio frequencies and are capable of produc-
ing directional sound. In other words, only the 
person at whom the speakers are aimed can hear 
the sound coming from them.
Select one of these items and work with a small 
group of your classmates to brainstorm as many 
alternative uses for the item as you can in 
15 minutes. Remember to abide by the rules of 
brainstorming!

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
For many entrepreneurs, the easiest part of launching a business is coming up with an idea for 
a new business concept or approach. Business success, however, requires much more than just 
a great new idea. In addition to coming up with a business idea and launching a business, five
critical steps guide the process of going from idea generation to growing a successful business.
Together these steps make up the new business planning process. Following these steps increases 
the entrepreneur’s chances for launching a successful and sustainable business.
Once entrepreneurs develop ideas for new businesses, the next step is to assess these ideas. 
An idea assessment is the process of examining a need in the market, developing a solution for 
that need, and determining the entrepreneur’s ability to successfully turn the idea into a business.
The best business ideas start with a group of customers with a common problem or need. Suc-
cessful entrepreneurs learn to apply the creative processes discussed in Chapter 3 to find solu-
tions for these customers. Entrepreneurs often identify multiple possible business ideas for any
given market need. The idea assessment process helps an entrepreneur more efficiently and effec-
tively examine multiple ideas to identify the solution with the most potential. Examining multiple 
business ideas ensures that the entrepreneur does not lock in on a single idea and overlook others
that have an even greater chance for success.
After identifying the most promising idea using the idea assessment process, the entrepre-
neur subjects it to a feasibility analysis to determine whether they can transform the idea into a 
viable business. A feasibility analysis is the process of determining whether an entrepreneur’s 
idea is a viable foundation for creating a successful business. Its purpose is to determine whether 
a business idea is worth pursuing. A feasibility study answers the question, “Should we proceed
with this business idea?” Its role is to serve as a filter, screening out ideas that lack the potential 
for building a successful business, before an entrepreneur commits the necessary resources to 
develop and test a business model or to build a business plan. A feasibility study primarily is an 
investigative tool. It is designed to give an entrepreneur a picture of the market and the sales and 
profit potential of a particular business idea. Will a ski resort located here attract enough custom-
ers to be successful? Will customers in this community support a sandwich shop with a retro
rock-n-roll theme? Can we build the product at a reasonable cost and sell it at a price customers 
are willing and able to pay? Does this entrepreneurial team have the ability to implement the idea 
successfully?
If the idea passes the feasibility analysis, the entrepreneur moves on to the next steps of 
the new business planning process. If the idea fails to pass muster, the entrepreneur drops it and 
moves on to the next idea. He or she has not wasted valuable time, money, energy, and other 
resources building a plan for launching a business that is destined to fail because it is based on a
flawed concept. Although it is impossible for a feasibility study to guarantee an idea’s success,
conducting a study reduces the likelihood that entrepreneurs will waste their time pursuing fruit-
less business ventures.
The business model answers the question, “How would we proceed with this business 
idea?” Developing a business model, which is the third step in planning a new business, helps 
the entrepreneur to fully understand all that will be required to launch and build the business.
Business modeling is another step that determines the potential for success for the new venture. 
It is a visual process that examines how all the moving parts of the business must work together 
to build a successful venture. It is the step in the planning process in which the entrepreneur tests 
the concept and uses what it learned from real customers to refine the business model before the 
entrepreneur commits the resources to grow the business to its full potential.
The idea assessment, feasibility study, business model, business plan, and strategic plan all 
play important but separate roles in the start-up and growth of an entrepreneurial venture (see
Figure 4.1). This chapter describes the idea assessment, feasibility study, and business model
development. Chapter 5 examines how to craft a business plan to guide the start-up of a new 
business, as well as the strategic planning process that helps navigate the growth of the business.
Idea Assessment
Successful entrepreneurs understand that the process of going from ideas to the launch of a new 
business venture is like a funnel. When the entrepreneur observes a need in the market, using the
creative process generates many business ideas that might address this need. Each step in the new 
idea assessment
the process of examining 
a need in the market, 
developing a solution for 
that need, and determining 
the entrepreneur’s ability to 
successfully turn the idea 
into a business.

CHAPTER 4 • CONDUCTING A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGNING A BUSINESS MODEL

business planning process narrows down the number of ideas until the entrepreneur is ready to 
launch a business that he or she has carefully researched and tested. An idea assessment helps the 
entrepreneur efficiently evaluate the numerous ideas that come out of the creative process before 
committing the time and effort to craft a business plan, design a business model, or even conduct a
feasibility analysis. One effective tool used to help assess ideas is the idea sketch pad.1
Entrepreneurs too often jump ahead and begin modeling or planning their business ideas. They 
get excited about the potential they imagine if they launched a business based on the idea. However,
most ideas do not become successful businesses. Alex Bruton, developer of the idea sketch pad, 
says it is human nature to misjudge how unlikely it is for a new business idea to actually become a 
successful business.2 Rather than act on a hunch, successful entrepreneurs are disciplined in evalu-
ating each new idea. Because it takes so many ideas to come up with a viable business concept,
entrepreneurs must become adept at quickly sorting through all of them.
The idea sketch pad helps an entrepreneur assess ideas in a relatively short period of time. 
When using the sketch pad, the entrepreneur asks a series of key questions addressing five key
parameters (see Figure 4.2).
1. Customers. Start with a group of customers who have a clear need that is not being 
addressed. This may be a need that no business is currently addressing, or it may be a 
need that no business is fully or adequately meeting for these customers. The entrepreneur 
assesses the customers by answering basic questions about the potential users of the prod-
uct or service and the potential buyers if they are different than the users. For instance, for 
sugary cereals, children are the users and their parents are the buyers. Specifically who 
would be the users of the offering? How would they use the offering? How many potential
customers are there?
2. Offering. Describe your idea for a product or service to offer the customers. Are you 
offering a product, a service, an experience, or a combination of one or more of these? 
What are its key features? Describe it in detail and sketch out an image of it if you can.
3. Value proposition. Explain why your product or service will be important to the custom-
ers. Why would your offering be valuable to the user and/or buyer? How does it address the
need these customers currently have that is not being met?
4. Core competencies. Does your offering include any technologies or unique features that 
will help differentiate it from competitors? Is it based on intellectual property that you can 
protect?

founding entrepreneurs of this venture? Do they have the skills and knowledge needed to
successfully turn the idea into a start-up venture? Can they attract key team members who 
will fill in any gaps in knowledge, skills, and experience?
By placing the answers to these questions on the sketch pad, entrepreneurs can clearly visualize
gaps or weaknesses in their idea. Rather than use the tool to make minor changes in an idea, they

can find ways to fundamentally change the idea to improve its chances for success in the market be-
fore they move ahead and launch a new business.3 Successful entrepreneurs do not become emotion-
ally attached to ideas. If the idea shows promise based on the idea sketch pad, they move ahead to the 
next step of conducting a feasibility analysis. If the gaps or weaknesses cannot be easily addressed,
entrepreneurs turn to the next idea and assess it using the sketch pad process.
Feasibility Analysis
After conducting the idea assessment, an entrepreneur scrutinizes the idea further through a 
feasibility analysis. A feasibility analysis consists of four interrelated components: an industry 
and market feasibility analysis, a product or service feasibility analysis, a financial feasibility 
analysis, and an entrepreneur feasibility analysis (see Figure 4.3). Rhonda Abrams, nationally-
syndicated columnist, author, and successful entrepreneur, says that feasibility analysis is an
opportunity to take a hard look at your idea to see whether it needs minor or major pivots, or if 
warranted, to be completely abandoned so you can move on to another idea.4
When evaluating the feasibility of a business idea, an analysis of the industry and targeted 
market segments serves as the starting point for the remaining three components of a feasibility 
analysis. The focus in this phase is two-fold: (1) To determine how attractive an industry is over-
all as a “home” for a new business and (2) to evaluate possible niches a small business can occupy 
profitably. When examining an industry, an entrepreneur should examine both the macro environ-
ment that can have an impact across many industries and the specific competitive environment of 
the industry of interest (see Figure 4.4).
Industry and Market Feasibility
The first step in assessing industry attractiveness is to paint a picture of the industry in broad
strokes, assessing it from a “macro” level. Most opportunities for new businesses within an in-
dustry are due to changes taking place in that industry. Foundational macro forces shape indus-
tries and the markets they serve. Changes in any of these macro forces can dramatically change 
the competitive nature of an industry and fundamentally change the needs and wants in its target 
market. Entrepreneurs must be vigilant when monitoring macro forces. Changes in macro forces 
may have created the initial opportunity the entrepreneur pursued when launching the business, 
and change will likely continue. If the entrepreneur does not adapt the business to meet the
changes these macro forces create in the industry and market, even the most innovative new busi-
ness may become outdated and left behind in the competitive landscape.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Six foundational macro forces create change in industries and the markets they serve:
1. Sociocultural. Social and cultural change can lead to dramatic changes that can create 
whole new industries and fundamentally transform existing industries. For example, in 
the 1970s and 1980s women began entering the workforce at much higher rates than had 
been the case previously. This change was a result of the women’s movement of the 1960s. 
Figure 4.5 displays the dramatic increase in the size of the American workforce that re-
sulted from this cultural change. Not only did more women enter the workforce, but they 
also had career aspirations to compete for jobs that previously had been dominated by male 
workers. This cultural change led to the birth of the daycare industry. It also resulted in a 
new segment within the women’s fashion industry for women’s business attire. It led to 
rapid growth in the restaurant industry as families began eating in restaurants much more 
frequently than previous generations and to a growth period for the auto industry as the 
percentage of families with two cars doubled from 1960 to 2011.5
Technological. Technological breakthroughs lead to the development of new products 
and entirely new industries. For example, the Internet is a technology that has had a 
profound impact on many industries. Before the Internet age, a few large companies
dominated the music industry. The Internet led to the creation of many new businesses 
within the music industry, including Pandora, Spotify, and Apple’s iTunes, which changed

how customers buy and listen to music. The Internet also changed how people consume 
information. As the news became available online, there was a dramatic decrease in the 
number of people reading print newspapers. As result, advertising revenues have 
plummeted for print newspapers, while online newspapers have experienced steady 
growth in advertising.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Hill Kemp and Suns River The world’s limited water
supply is a growing concern. Hill Kemp, founder and CEO of Suns River, is using solar 
technology to help turn poor quality water into safe, distilled water. The device is a solar still 
that purifies even the saltiest water into safe, clean water. Although technology is not new, 
Kemp’s process is much more efficient. Using Suns River technology, a family can convert 
80 percent of brackish water into distilled water. What is left is a block of salt. Each Suns River 
unit can supply a family of four with all the clean water they need. Kemp is targeting his 
product for coastal desert areas that would benefit from an affordable means to generate 
clean water. Suns River systems sell for $3,000 to $5,000. Kemp plans to expand the Suns River
product line to include solar stills that can produce enough water to use for agricultural 
greenhouses.6 ■
2. Demographic. Changing demographics create opportunities for entrepreneurs. For example, 
as Generation Y (those born during the 1980s to early 1990s) reaches adulthood, businesses
will begin to pay attention to the next generation, Generation Z. Although Generation Y is 
optimistic and idealistic, those who are part of Generation Z (those born between the mid-
1990s to about 2013) are much more realistic. School violence and the Great Recession 
(which began in 2008) have shaped their lives. Generation Z is more realistic in how they 
view the world. Because they have watched their parents’ generation struggle with pro-
longed unemployment and economic uncertainty, they intend to be careful with their money. 
Those in Generation Z will seek products and services that offer value. In a survey of mem-
bers of Generation Z conducted by the Intelligence Group, 57 percent said they would rather 
save money than spend it!7
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jason Greenspan 
and Silver Stars Fitness Jason Greenspan targets a 
different market than most fitness clubs. Rather than cater to 
young working professionals, Greenspan’s Silver Stars Fitness
located in New York City is specifically designed for the fit-
ness needs of baby boomers. Silver Stars Fitness offers classes 
such as Mature Boot Camp for basic strength and cardiovas-
cular workouts, Burn Baby Burn that targets fat loss, Balance 
and Fall Prevention, Zumba Silver, Central Park Walking, 
Arthritis Soothing, and Osteoporosis Bone Blast. Silver Stars 
offers smaller classes that are all held during the middle of 
the day to make them most convenient for retired baby 
boomers. Greenspan plans to expand to more locations 
to keep up with the growing population of retired baby 
boomers.8 ■
3. Economic. Although many companies struggle during eco-
nomic downturns, some businesses are able to grow. For 
example, businesses in the e-learning industry thrived during 
the Great Recession. Web-based learning provides custom-
ers with opportunities to improve their education and skills at an affordable price. Given the 
highly competitive job market during a recession, additional knowledge and skills offer job 
seekers a competitive advantage when applying for a new position. However, those who were 
unemployed or afraid of becoming unemployed were unwilling to pay the growing cost of 
tuition for traditional educational programs. Companies that provide high quality Web-based 
e-learning at a fraction of the cost of traditional university-based education filled this gap in 
the market.
4. Political and legal. The enactment of new legislation creates opportunities for entrepre-
neurs. For example, when the Affordable Health Care Act (also known as ObamaCare) 
Silver Star Fitness

154
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
was passed in 2010, entrepreneurs recognized that the legislation created a complex ar-
ray of new requirements for healthcare companies. Because of this legislation, payment 
for healthcare is shifting from fee-for-service (healthcare providers are paid a set amount 
for each procedure or service they provide) to a system based on pay-for-performance. 
In a pay-for-performance system, insurance companies reward healthcare providers and
hospitals for initiatives that improve the quality, efficiency, and overall value of health care. 
Because pay-for-performance is new to healthcare, savvy entrepreneurs are creating new
companies that help healthcare providers and hospitals to track and report performance-
related metrics based on the value of the healthcare they provide, measure and improve
quality of healthcare outcomes, and enhance efficiency in their healthcare delivery systems.
5. Global. Global trends create opportunities for even the smallest of companies. More open
global markets allow businesses to seek customers and suppliers from all corners of the world.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ethan Siegel and Orb Audio Orb 
Audio, headquartered in New York City, manufactures high-end
speakers for home theater systems from its factory in Sherman Oaks, 
California. Rather than sell through traditional retail outlets, Orb Audio 
sells directly to the customer through its Web site. When the dollar weak-
ened against other currencies in 2008, cofounder Ethan Siegel noticed a 
sharp increase in orders from international markets. The weak dollar 
made American-made goods more attractive to international customers 
whose buying power improved with the declining dollar. Siegel started
running Internet advertisements aimed at consumers in the markets 
where most of the increase in international sales were coming from, in-
cluding Great Britain, Canada, Finland, and Australia. Global sales for Orb 
Audio now comprise 35 percent of sales. Finland alone accounts for 
10 percent of total sales for Orb Audio. Although domestic sales for Orb Audio have declined 
since 2008, total revenue continues to grow due to the expansion of international sales for
this small manufacturer.9 ■
While evaluating the six foundational macro trends, entrepreneurs should answer the follow-
ing questions to help further evaluate the attractiveness of that industry in light of the impact of 
the macro forces for change:
● How large is the industry?
● How fast is it growing?
● Is the industry as a whole profitable?
● Is the industry characterized by high profit margins or razor-thin margins?
● How essential are its products or services to customers?
● What trends are shaping the industry’s future?
● What threats does the industry face?
● What opportunities does the industry face?
● How crowded is the industry?
● How intense is the level of competition in the industry?
● Is the industry young, mature, or somewhere in between?
Addressing these questions helps entrepreneurs determine whether the potential for sufficient 
demand for their products and services exist.
Porter’s Five Forces Model
After evaluating the broader macro environment, the entrepreneur changes focus to the more
immediate competitive environment. A useful tool for analyzing a specific industry’s attractive-
ness within the competitive environment is the Five Forces Model developed by Michael Porter

Driverless cars have been the stuff of science fiction for several 
decades. As a result of several recent technological breakthroughs, 
a fully functional driverless car may soon become possible. How-
ever, all of the macro forces shaping the automobile industry must
come into alignment for the driverless car to become a true mar-
ket opportunity.
Sociocultural environment. For generations, the auto-
mobile has been enmeshed within the American culture. 
While other countries developed advanced mass transit sys-
tems, Americans stayed loyal to their cars and the freedom 
they offered to allow them to drive when, where, and how 
they wanted to. However, research from KPMG suggests 
that there may be a change in consumer attitudes. People 
are growing weary of ever-longer and more congested com-
mutes. The KPMG study finds that Americans would enthu-
siastically demand driverless cars if they offered the promise 
of cheaper and quicker commutes and if the cars still allowed
d
people to turn off the driverless feature for pleasure driving. 
A survey conducted by CarInsurance.com found that 
20 percent of drivers would “hand over the keys tomorrow” 
if a safe, driverless car were available for consumers to pur-
chase. Ninety percent of those surveyed would consider a 
driverless car if it could bring down insurance costs.
Technological environment. Due to advances in sensors, 
microcontrollers, GPS, radar, lasers, and cameras, the tech-
nological feasibility for a driverless car has advanced quickly 
in recent years. Traditional automobile companies, including 
Nissan, General Motors, and Lexus, all have driverless car 
technologies under development. Google is a leader in the 
development of technology to enable driverless cars. Google 
has logged hundreds of thousands of miles of testing for its 
driverless technology with no reported safety issues. In addi-
tion, upstart electric car company Tesla is developing an auto-
pilot system it plans to offer with its cars by 2020.
Demographic environment. As baby boomers age, driver-
less car technologies offer this generation the promise of 
continued autonomy even after they reach the age that is no 
longer safe for them to drive.
Economic environment. With continuing concerns about 
the cost and supply of energy, driverless cars may offer sig-
nificant fuel savings. Computers in the driverless cars will 
be able to determine the most direct route with least traffic
congestion and will drive at controlled speeds, all of which 
will improve fuel consumption for every car on the road.
Political/legal environment. Although the other macro
forces all seem to favor the emergence of a market for 
driverless cars, the political and legal environment is not all 
favorable. Toyota has been fighting multiple lawsuits for sev-
eral years that are tied to allegations that its cars are prone
to unintended acceleration. The complaints allege that the
cars would unexpectedly begin to accelerate under various 
conditions, and that these accelerations led to numerous
accidents. A main cause of the problems may be in the soft-
ware in the computers that control all modern automobiles. 
In a pivotal case in Oklahoma, Toyota has been put in a
position where it must prove that its software does not have
t
any bugs that may have caused the unexpected acceleration 
events. If this case goes against Toyota, auto makers can
assume that they must be prepared to demonstrate that any 
critical software system that controls the operation of a car
must be free of any bugs under any and all possible circum-
stances. Some legal experts believe this seemingly impos-
sible standard leaves auto companies no choice but shelve 
any products with software that directs the operation of the 
vehicle.

shaping the feasibility of the driverless car?

you pursue your own model of a driverless car? Why or 
why not?

sion that may result from the introduction of the driverless 
car into the market?

Hands On . . . How To
Forces Shaping Innovation: The Driverless Car
of the Harvard Business School (see Figure 4.6). Five forces interact with one another to deter-
mine the setting in which companies compete and hence the attractiveness of the industry: (1) the 
rivalry among competing firms, (2) the bargaining power of suppliers, (3) the bargaining power 
of buyers, (4) the threat of new entrants, and (5) the threat of substitute products or services.
Rivalry among companies competing in the industry. The strongest of the five forces in 
most industries is the rivalry that exists among the businesses competing in a particular 

156
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
market. Much like the horses running in the Kentucky Derby, businesses in a market are
jockeying for position in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. When a company cre-
ates an innovation or develops a unique strategy that transforms the market, competing com-
panies must adapt or run the risk of being forced out of business. This force makes markets 
a dynamic and highly competitive place. Generally, an industry is more attractive when:
● The number of competitors is large or, at the other extreme, quite small (fewer than five).
● Competitors are not similar in size or capability.
● The industry is growing at a fast pace.
● The opportunity to sell a differentiated product or service is present.
Bargaining power of suppliers to the industry. The greater the leverage suppliers of 
key raw materials or components have, the less attractive is the industry. For instance, 
Under Armour, which is in the athletic footwear and apparel industry, has agreements with 
27 manufacturers in 14 countries. Its top 10 suppliers manufacture less than half of its 
products. Because of its diversity in suppliers, Under Armour has a favorable bargaining 
position with them. It is not dependent on any one or even a small group of its suppliers.10
Generally, an industry is more attractive when:
● Many suppliers sell a commodity product to the companies in it.
● Substitute products are available for the items suppliers provide.
● Companies in the industry find it easy to switch from one supplier to another or to 
substitute products (i.e., “switching costs” are low).
● The items suppliers provide the industry account for a relatively small portion of the 
cost of the industry’s finished products.
Bargaining power of buyers. Just as suppliers to an industry can be a source of pressure, 
buyers also have the potential to exert significant power over businesses, making it less
attractive. When the number of customers is small and the cost of switching to competitors’

products is low, buyers’ influence on companies is high. Famous for offering its customers 
low prices, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, is also well known for applying re-
lentless pressure to its 21,000 suppliers for price concessions, which it almost always man-
ages to get.11 Generally, an industry is more attractive when:
● Industry customers’ “switching costs” to competitors’ products or to substitutes are 
relatively high.
● The number of buyers in the industry is large.
● Customers demand products that are differentiated rather than purchase commodity 
products they can obtain from any supplier (and subsequently can pit one company 
against another to drive down price).
● Customers find it difficult to gather information on suppliers’ costs, prices, and product 
features—something that is becoming much easier for customers in many industries to 
do by using the Internet.
● The items companies sell to the industry account for a relatively small portion of the 
cost of their customers’ finished products.
Threat of new entrants to the industry. The larger the pool of potential new entrants to 
an industry, the greater is the threat to existing companies in it. This is particularly true in 
industries where the barriers to entry, such as capital requirements, specialized knowledge, 
access to distribution channels, and others are low. Generally, an industry is more attractive 
to new entrants when:
● The advantages of economies of scale are absent. Economies of scale exist when com-
panies in an industry achieve low average costs by producing huge volumes of items 
(e.g., computer chips).
● Capital requirements to enter the industry are low.
● Cost advantages are not related to company size.
● Buyers are not extremely brand-loyal, making it easier for new entrants to the industry 
to draw customers away from existing businesses.
● Governments, through their regulatory and international trade policies, do not restrict 
new companies from entering the industry.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jesse Parker and John Montague and Aspire 
Beverages The market for sports drinks has been dominated by two major brands, 
Gatorade and PowerAde. However, new competitors are entering the market due to growing
concern that the major brands contain high-fructose corn syrup, artificial coloring, and other 
unhealthy ingredients. Jesse Parker and John Montague, two self-described hockey dads,
launched Aspire Beverages to compete in this well-established market with a healthier alter-
native. As parents, they were concerned about the unhealthy ingredients their children were 
consuming with the sports drinks they drank. The Minneapolis-based company promotes its 
drinks as having no artificial sugars, artificial colors, or artificial flavors. Distribution of Aspire 
is through traditional retail outlets such as grocery stores, so it is competing for shelf space 
with the major national brands.12 ■
Threat of substitute products or services. Substitute products or services can turn an 
entire industry on its head. For instance, many makers of glass bottles have closed their 
doors in recent years as their customers—from soft drink bottlers to ketchup makers—have
switched to plastic containers, which are lighter, less expensive to ship, and less subject to 
breakage. Printed newspapers have seen their readership rates decline as new generations 
of potential readers turn to their iPads and smart phones for sources of news that are con-
stantly updated. Generally, an industry is more attractive when:
● Quality substitute products are not readily available.
● The prices of substitute products are not significantly lower than those of the industry’s
products.
● Buyers’ cost of switching to substitute products is high.
After surveying the power these five forces exert on an industry, entrepreneurs can 
evaluate the potential for their companies to generate reasonable sales and profits in a 

158
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
particular industry. In other words, they can answer the question, “Is this industry a good 
home for my business?” Table 4.1 provides a matrix that allows entrepreneurs to assign 
quantitative scores to the five forces influencing industry attractiveness. Note that the lower 
the score for an industry, the more attractive it is.
Market niches. The next step in assessing an industry is to identify potentially attractive 
niches that exist in the industry. Many small businesses prosper by sticking to niches in 
markets that are too small to attract the attention of large competitors; occupying an in-
dustry niche enables these businesses to shield themselves to some extent from the power 
of the five forces. The key question entrepreneurs address about a possible niche market 
is “Can we identify a niche that is large enough to produce a profit, or can we position our 
company uniquely in the market to differentiate it from the competition in a meaningful 
way?” Entrepreneurs who have designed successful focus or differentiation strategies for 
their companies can exploit these niches to their advantage. Questions entrepreneurs should 
address in this portion of the feasibility analysis include:
● Which niche in the market will we occupy?
● How large is this market segment, and how fast is it growing?
● What is the basis for differentiating our product or service from competitors?
● Do we have a superior business model that will be difficult for competitors to 
reproduce?
Companies can shield themselves from some of the negative impact of these five 
forces by finding a niche and occupying it. For example, Taylor Morrison found a niche
market in residential real estate that addresses the needs of immigrant families seeking 
housing: Allow multiple generations of the same family to live together. He is building 
townhouses in Arizona that allow children, parents, and grandparents to live together 
comfortably in a single townhouse unit. Each townhouse has a bedroom and a bathroom 
on the ground floor for the grandparents. The second level has the kitchen, living room, 
and dining room. The third floor has three bedrooms and two bathrooms for the parents 
and their children.13
TABLE 4.1 Five Forces Matrix
Assign a value to rate the importance of each of the five forces to the industry on a 1 (not important) to 5 (very important) scale. Then
assign a value to reflect the threat that each force poses to the industry.
Multiply the importance rating in column 2 by the threat rating in column 3 to produce a weighted score.
Add the weighted scores in column 3 to get a total weighted score. This score measures the industry’s attractiveness. The matrix is a 
useful tool for comparing the attractiveness of different industries.

CHAPTER 4 • CONDUCTING A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGNING A BUSINESS MODEL
159
Generally, a niche strategy is a good way for a new business to enter the market. It 
usually takes fewer resources for the start-up due to lower marketing costs and the ability 
to start on a smaller scale. Success rates tend to be higher for niche businesses because 
they have less direct competition. Without much competition, niche businesses can charge
higher prices, which allows for quicker positive cash flow during start-up and better 
margins once profitable.
However, entrepreneurs should be aware of some cautions with a niche strategy:
● Entering a niche requires adaptability in your initial plan. While developing their 
business models, entrepreneurs can misjudge what customers actually need within a
niche market. Unless they are willing and able to adjust their business models to react to 
the realities of the market niche, the business will fail if it does not offer the customers 
what they really want.
● Niches change. Even if an entrepreneur evaluates the market correctly in the begin-
ning, niche markets (like any market) change over time. Success in a niche requires that 
entrepreneurs adapt as the market changes. Too many entrepreneurs get stuck doing the 
same thing or offering the same product while their customers’ needs and wants evolve. 
Even though it is a niche, the market is not isolated and is subject to the same forces and
trends that can impact any market.
● Niches can go away. Although many niches can last for years, no market is forever. 
Niches can dry up—sometimes quite suddenly. Again, adaptation can offer some hope, 
but if the decline is too rapid, niche businesses can fail.
● Niches can grow. Although significant growth in a market may not sound bad, it can 
attract more competitors. If a niche market grows large enough, it can attract some very 
large competitors. At some point the entrepreneur’s cozy market niche can become quite 
crowded. Eventually, it may no longer be a true market niche, which requires that the 
entrepreneur adapt his or her business strategies to meet this more competitive market. 
Prices will be forced downward, while at the same time the costs of business may go up 
due to increased marketing costs, greater expectations from customers, and higher labor 
costs due to more competition for qualified employees.
Although finding a market niche is the most common and a relatively safe entry strategy for 
new entrepreneurial businesses, it still requires continued attention to competitive forces in the 
market.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Kurt Nelson, Tyler Seymour, and Drew Burchfield and 
Aloompa Kurt Nelson, Tyler Seymour, and Drew Burchfield launched their business, 
Aloompa, to develop a variety of mobile apps for the music industry. During the early stages of 
the business, they realized that their most promising avenue for scaling their business was to focus 
on one specific niche within the music industry—live music festivals. Aloompa’s mobile app for the
Bonnaroo Music Festival, a popular four-day rock music festival in Manchester, Tennessee, at-
tracted the attention of several other music festival organizers. Kurt Nelson, president of Aloompa, 
says focusing on that single niche allowed the company to develop a core framework that could 
be adapted to any music festival and to many other similar events. Aloompa has become known 
as a market leader in music festival apps. Although Aloompa operates in a niche market, it is a 
large and growing market that has allowed the company to expand to music festivals throughout 
Europe and in other countries around the world.14 ■
Product or Service Feasibility Analysis:  
Is There a Market?
Once entrepreneurs discover that sufficient market potential for their product or service idea
actually exists, they sometimes rush in with their exuberant enthusiasm ready to launch a business
without actually considering whether they can actually produce the product or provide the service 
at a reasonable cost. A product or service feasibility analysis determines the degree to which a 
product or service idea appeals to potential customers and identifies the resources necessary to 
LO5
Describe the various 
methods of conducting 
primary and secondary 
market research.

160
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
produce the product or provide the service. This portion of the feasibility analysis addresses
the question, “Are customers willing to purchase our goods and services?” Entrepreneurs need 
feedback from potential customers to successfully answer this question. Conducting primary 
research involves collecting data firsthand and analyzing it; secondary research involves gather-
ing data that has already been compiled and is available, often at a reasonable cost or sometimes 
even free. In both types of research, gathering both quantitative and qualitative information is im-
portant to drawing accurate conclusions about a product’s or service’s market potential. Primary 
research tools include customer surveys, focus groups, construction of prototypes, in-home trials, 
and “windshield” research (driving around and observing the competition). The goal of primary 
and secondary research should not only be to find support to validate the business concept. An
overly optimistic entrepreneur may overlook important information about the true feasibility of 
the business if he or she only searches for information that affirms starting the business. It also is 
important to search for information that does not support the concept. Depending on the nature 
and severity of any negative evidence, the entrepreneur can either adapt the concept if it is pos-
sible to do so or, if necessary, abandon the idea entirely.
CUSTOMER SURVEYS AND QUESTIONNAIRES Keep them short. Word your questions carefully 
so that you do not bias the results, and use a simple ranking system (e.g., a 1-to-5 scale, with
1 representing “definitely would not buy” and 5 representing “definitely would buy”). Test 
your survey for problems on a small number of people before putting it to use. Web surveys are 
inexpensive, easy to conduct, and provide feedback fast. Do not only survey people you know or 
those who are convenient to reach. Survey people who represent the target market of the business.
FOCUS GROUPS A focus group involves enlisting a small number of potential customers 
(usually 8 to 12) to give you feedback on specific issues about your product or service (or the 
business idea itself). Listen carefully for what focus group members like and don’t like about 
your product or service as they tell you what is on their minds. The founders of one small snack 
food company that produced apple chips conducted several focus groups to gauge customers’ 
acceptance of the product and to guide many key business decisions, ranging from the product’s 
name to its packaging. Once again, consider creating virtual focus groups on the Web. One 
small bicycle retailer conducts 10 online focus groups each year at virtually no cost and gains 
valuable marketing information from them. Feedback from online customers is fast, convenient,
and real-time.
PROTOTYPES An effective way to gauge the viability of a product is to build a prototype of it.
A prototype is an original, functional model of a new product that entrepreneurs can put into
the hands of potential customers so that they can see it, test it, and use it. Prototypes usually
point out potential problems in a product’s design, giving inventors the opportunity to fix 
them even before they put the prototype into customers’ hands. The feedback customers give 
entrepreneurs based on prototypes often leads to design improvements and new features, some of 
which the entrepreneurs might never have discovered on their own. Makers of computer software
frequently put prototypes of new products into customers’ hands as they develop new products 
or improve existing ones. Known as beta tests, these trials result in an iterative design process in
which software designers collect feedback from users and then incorporate their ideas into the 
product for the next round of tests. Three-dimensional printing creates a less expensive way for 
entrepreneurs to develop a basic prototype of a product based on drawings. Although the output 
of a three-dimensional printer is not a fully functional product, it does provide a method of 
creating a model to test and to use to source manufacturing of component parts.
IN-HOME TRIALS One technique that reveals some of the most insightful information into how
customers actually use a product or service is also the most challenging to coordinate: in-home 
trials. An in-home trial involves sending researchers into customers’ homes to observe them as 
they use the company’s product or service. However, in-home trials can be expensive to conduct 
and therefore may not be affordable for the budgets of most entrepreneurs.
“WINDSHIELD” RESEARCH A good source of information is to observe customers interacting 
with existing businesses within an industry. Windshield research involves driving around and

firsthand and analyzing it.

161
observing customers interacting with similar kinds of businesses and learning what customers
like and don’t like about those businesses. For example, before one potential investor was willing 
to commit funding for a new coffee shop, he required that the entrepreneur get traffic counts at 
local competitors’ outlets. He observed heavy demand and often long lines, which helped provide 
support for the need for a new coffee shop.
Secondary research should be used to support, not replace, primary research. Secondary 
research, which is usually less expensive to collect than primary data, includes the following 
sources:
TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND BUSINESS DIRECTORIES To locate a trade association, use Business
Information Sources (University of California Press) or the Encyclopedia of Associations (Gale 
Research). To find suppliers, use The Thomas Register of American Manufacturers (Thomas 
Publishing Company) or Standard and Poor’s Register of Corporations, Executives, and Industries
(Standard and Poor Corporation). The American Wholesalers and Distributors Directory includes
details on more than 18,000 wholesalers and distributors.
INDUSTRY DATABASES Several online business databases are available through university librar-
ies, such as BizMiner, Encyclopedia of American Industries, Encyclopedia of Emerging Industries, 
Encyclopedia of Global Industries, Encyclopedia of Products & Industries—Manufacturing,
IBISWorld, Manufacturing & Distribution USA: Industry Analyses, Statistics and Leading 
Companies, and Market Share Reporter. These databases offer a rich variety of information on 
specific industries, including statistical analyses, geographic reports, trend analyses, and profiles.
DEMOGRAPHIC DATA To learn more about the demographic characteristics of customers in 
general, use The State and Metropolitan Data Book (Government Printing Office) and 
k
The 
Sourcebook of Zip Code Demographics (CACI, Inc.), which provides detailed breakdowns of the
population in every zip code in the country. Sales and Marketing Management’s Survey of Buying 
Power (Bill Communications) has statistics on consumer, retail, and industrial buying.
r
CENSUS DATA The Bureau of the Census publishes a wide variety of reports that summarize the
wealth of data found in its census database, which is available at most libraries and at the Census
Bureau’s Web site at www.census.gov.
FORECASTS The U.S. Industry & Trade Outlook published by the Department of Commerce, 
k
International Trade Administration traces the growth of 200 industries and gives a five-year 
forecast for each one. Many government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Commerce
(www.commerce.gov). offer forecasts on everything from interest rates to the number of housing
starts. Again, a government research librarian can help you find what you need.
MARKET RESEARCH Someone may already have compiled the market research you need. The
FINDex Worldwide Directory of Market Research Reports, Studies, and Surveys (Cambridge 
Information Group) lists more than 10,600 studies available for purchase. Other directories of 
business research include Simmons Study of Media and Markets (Simmons Market Research
Bureau Inc.) and the A.C. Nielsen Retail Index (A.C. Nielsen Company).
x
ARTICLES Magazine and journal articles pertinent to your business are a great source of information. 
Use the Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature, the Business Periodicals Index (similar to
x
the Reader’s Guide but focusing on business periodicals), and Ulrich’s Guide to International 
Periodicals to locate the ones you need.
LOCAL DATA Your state Department of Commerce and your local Chamber of Commerce will

THE INTERNET Entrepreneurs can benefit from the vast amount of market research information 
available on the Internet. This is an efficient resource with up-to-date information, and much of 
it is free. Entrepreneurs must use caution, however, to ensure the credibility of online sources.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Insects are a common source of food protein for people in many
parts of the world. One study suggests that 80 percent of the
world population regularly includes insects in their diets. How-
ever, in much of the Western world the thought of eating bugs 
is considered less than appetizing! This soon may be changing. 
With continued global population growth, concerns about the
sustainability of Western agricultural practices, and rising meat 
and grain prices, Western cultures are beginning to entertain the 
notion of edible insects as a good source of protein. Entrepreneurs
have taken note of these changes in attitudes and are beginning
to develop business models that will benefit from the growing
acceptance of worms, crickets, and other bugs as a food source.
Insects in Energy Bars
Patrick Crowley introduced his energy bars, called Chapul, as a
means to offer an environmentally friendly source of protein to
customers. Through his research, Crowley discovered that crickets 
are 10 times more efficient than cows or pigs at turning vegetable
matter into protein. Crowley partnered with a friend who is a chef 
to develop a recipe for energy bars using cricket flour and had 
the bars approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Crowley
ran a Kickstarter campaign that raised enough money to make 
2,000 bars, which sold quickly through online and retail sales. 
Based on his early success, Crowley contracted with a company
to make larger batches of the bars. Chapul cricket bars are sold in 
75 stores, and Crowley is negotiating with larger national chains 
including Whole Foods. Chapul is trending to reach $1 million in
annual revenues within its first two years of operations.
Insect Farming Supply
One of the advantages of cultivating insects as a source of protein 
is that it does not take much space to run an insect farm. In fact, 
a California company called Tiny Farms sells kits that allow any-
one to farm edible insects in their homes or businesses. Andrew 
Brentano, cofounder of Tiny Farms, notes that there is a short-
age of food-grade insects available in the United States due to 
the increasing acceptance and demand for edible insects. Each 
kit includes a starter package of bugs (locusts, grasshoppers, and
worms), insect farming tools and equipment, bug food, and an 
instruction manual for growing insects for food. Tiny Farms also
provides online support, forums, and consulting for aspiring insect 
farmers. In addition to serving those raising bugs for personal con-
sumption, Tiny Farms intends to become a major supplier for the 
growing number of commercial bug farmers.
Insect Food Cart
Monica Martinez loved snacking on bugs when she was a young 
child growing up in Mexico. She decided to find a way to share her
taste for insects with residents of her new home, San Francisco, 
California. Martinez’s food cart, Don Bugito, offers menu items such 
as wax moth larvae tacos, chocolate covered salted crickets, and tof-
fee mealworms over vanilla ice cream. Martinez also offers in-home
catering services, featuring a full five-course meal of edible insects,
and has begun to sell prepackaged versions of some of her creations.

edible insects to American consumers?

into the edible insect market?

CHAPTER 4 • CONDUCTING A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGNING A BUSINESS MODEL
163
Financial Feasibility Analysis:  
Is There Enough Margin?
The third component of a feasibility analysis involves assessing the financial feasibility of a pro-
posed business venture. At this stage of the process, a broad financial analysis that examines the 
basic economic feasibility is sufficient. This component of the feasibility analysis answers the 
question, “Can this business generate adequate profits?” If the business concept passes the over-
all feasibility analysis, an entrepreneur should conduct a more thorough financial analysis when 
developing the business model and creating a full-blown business plan. The four major elements 
to be included in a financial feasibility analysis include the initial capital requirement, estimated 
earnings, time out of cash, and resulting return on investment.
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS Just as a boy scout needs fuel to start a fire, an entrepreneur needs 
capital to start a business. Some businesses require large amounts of capital, but others do
not. Typically, service businesses require less capital to launch than do manufacturing or retail 
businesses. Start-up companies often need capital to purchase equipment, buildings, technology,
and other tangible assets as well as to hire and train employees, promote their products and 
services, and establish a presence in the market. A good feasibility analysis provides an estimate 
of the amount of start-up capital an entrepreneur will need to get the business up and running.
When preparing to launch his microbrewery, Cigar City Brewing, Joey Redner needed
$585,000 to purchase the brewing system, other equipment, and inventory and to cover initial 
operating expenses. Redner was able to secure a bank loan after his father agreed to pledge busi-
ness property as collateral. To help bootstrap his operations, Redner was able to get a large con-
tingent of volunteers to help staff the business, who all agreed to work for free beer. He also set 
up distribution agreements with two beer distributors before he began brewing his craft beers.15
It is important to keep in mind that the typical start-up in the United States can successfully 
launch with an average of only $10,000,16 and one in five start-ups get launched with no fund-
ing at all.17 How do entrepreneurs get started with so little funding? Most entrepreneurs employ 
a variety of techniques called bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is the process of finding creative 
ways to exploit opportunities to launch and grow businesses with the limited resources available 
for most start-up ventures. It includes a variety of strategies and techniques that cover all of the 
functions of running a business: marketing, staffing, inventory and production management, cash 
flow management, and administrative processes needed to keep a business operating.18
You will learn more about bootstrapping in Chapter 8 and more about finding sources of 
business funding, both debt and equity, in Chapter 14.
ESTIMATED EARNINGS In addition to producing an estimate of the start-up company’s capital 
requirements, an entrepreneur also should forecast the earning potential of the proposed business.
Industry trade associations and publications such as the RMA Annual Statement Studies offer 
guidelines on preparing sales and earnings estimates for specific types of businesses. From these, 
entrepreneurs can estimate the financial results they and their investors can expect to see from the 
business venture if the start-up is executed according to plan.
TIME OUT OF CASH A common cause of business failure is running out of cash before the business 
breaks even and can support itself through the cash flow from operations. According to a study by 
U.S. Bank, four out of five small business failures can be attributed to “starting out with too little 
money.”19 During the planning stage, the entrepreneur should estimate the total cash it will take 
to sustain the business until the business achieves break-even cash flow. This estimate should be 
based on a less-than-optimistic scenario because there are almost always unexpected costs and
delays in the start-up and growth of a new business. For an operating business, to calculate the 
number of months until the business runs out of cash, simply divide the amount of available cash 
remaining in the business by the negative cash flowing from the business each month. The result 
is the number of months the business can survive at its current rate of negative cash flow. Ideally, 
the business will be able to grow quickly enough to avoid reaching the point of no more cash.
RETURN ON INVESTMENT The final aspect of the financial feasibility analysis combines the 
estimated earnings and the capital requirements to determine the rate of return the venture is
LO6

elements of a financial 
feasibility analysis.

164
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
expected to produce. One simple measure is the rate of return on the capital invested, which 
is calculated by dividing the estimated earnings the business yields by the amount of capital
invested in the business. This aspect of financial feasibility is generally of most concern to 
investors. Although financial estimates at the feasibility analysis stage typically are rough, they 
are an important part of the entrepreneur’s ultimate “go” or “no go” decision about the business 
ventures. A venture must produce an attractive rate of return relative to the level of risk it requires.
This risk–return trade-off means that the higher the level of risk a prospective business involves,
the higher the rate of return it must provide to the entrepreneur and investors. Why should an
entrepreneur take on all of the risks of starting and running a business that produces a mere 3 or 
4 percent rate of return when he or she could earn that much in a risk-free investment at a bank or 
other financial institution? Although entrepreneurs should pay more attention to this calculation, 
many do not because they tend to get wrapped up in the emotion and excitement of their business 
ideas. You will learn more about developing detailed financial forecasts for a business start-up 
in Chapter 11.
Wise entrepreneurs take the time to subject their ideas to a feasibility analysis like the one 
described here, whatever outcome it produces. If the analysis suggests that transforming the idea 
into a viable business is not feasible, the entrepreneur can move on to the next idea, confident that 
he or she has not wasted valuable resources launching a business destined to fail.
If the analysis so far finds that there is a market for the idea and that it has real potential as a 
profitable business, the entrepreneur can move to the final component of the feasibility analysis.
Entrepreneur Feasibility: Is This Idea Right for Me?
Suppose that the feasibility analysis thus far has established that the industry and market are 
favorable, there is strong evidence of demand for the product or service in the market, and the
concept appears financially feasible. There is one last component of feasibility to examine—the 
readiness of the entrepreneur (and, if applicable, the entrepreneur’s team) to launch the venture 
successfully. Many new businesses require that an entrepreneur have a certain set of knowledge, 
experiences, and skills to have any chance of being successful. This is called entrepreneurial 
readiness. Some of these can be simple skills. For example, starting a landscaping business re-
quires knowing how to operate a lawnmower and other equipment. Being successful in a land-
scaping business also depends on some level of knowledge about plants and grasses. Other new 
businesses may require a higher level of knowledge and skills. For example, starting an account-
ing firm requires a high level of knowledge and experience in the laws and practice of accounting. 
Entrepreneurs can gain the knowledge and skills they need from previous jobs, from their formal 
education, or from their interests or hobbies. They can also acquire knowledge as part of what 
they work on during the planning process. Entrepreneurial readiness also involves issues such as
temperament, work ethic, and so forth. Performing an entrepreneurial self-assessment can help 
evaluate entrepreneurial readiness (see Figure 4.7).
Another way to ensure the necessary knowledge and skills are in place is through building a
team. For example, an aspiring entrepreneur may have an idea for a new app for smart phones but 
may not have any programming or design skills. He or she would be best served by exploring the 
possibility of adding people to the team with that skill set. If there is more than one entrepreneur 
starting the business, all of them should complete an assessment and use this as a launching point 
to examine their collective entrepreneurial feasibility.
Beyond the entrepreneur’s readiness to start a business, the second aspect of entrepreneur 
feasibility is to assess whether the business can meet the financial and nonfinancial needs of 
the entrepreneur and the team. Will the business be able to generate enough profit to support 
everyone’s income needs? If it is successful, will it also meet the wealth goals of the founding 
team? Just because a business is profitable does not mean that it is profitable enough to support 
the entrepreneur and his or her team. This can vary from entrepreneur to entrepreneur. A 22-year-
old single entrepreneur fresh out of college has very different financial needs than a 42-year-old
married entrepreneur who has a mortgage, car payments, and tuition for private schools for his
or her children! But making money is not the only thing that matters for most people. Does busi-
ness fit with goals and aspirations the entrepreneur has outside of work? A business that demands

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
extensive travel may not fit with an entrepreneur who has a goal of being highly involved with his 
or her family. A restaurant, which often demands that the entrepreneur be involved 6 or 7 days a 
week, 52 weeks a year, may not be a good business model for an entrepreneur who wants to travel 
and take extended vacations.
Once an entrepreneur tests his or her business idea using the four components of a feasibility 
assessment, the next stage of the new business planning process is to develop a business model.
Developing and Testing a Business Model
In their groundbreaking study of how successful entrepreneurs develop business models, 
Osterwalder and Pigneur identified the common elements that successful entrepreneurs and 
investors use when developing and evaluating a business model. They found that most entre-
preneurs use a visual process, such as diagraming their business on a whiteboard, when devel-
oping their business ideas.20 They don’t just start writing the text of a business plan. Rather,
they map out the key components required to make their businesses successful. A business
model adds more detail to the evaluation of a new business begun during the feasibility analy-
sis by graphically depicting the “moving parts” of the business and ensuring that they are all 
working together.
When building a business model, the entrepreneur addresses a series of key questions that 
will explain how a business will become successful. What value does the business offer custom-
ers? Who is my target market? What do they expect of me as my customers? How do I get in-
formation to them, and how do they want to get the product? What are the key activities to make 
this all come together, and what will they cost? What resources do I need to make this happen, 
including money? Who are key partners I will need to attract to be successful?
In their study, Osterwalder and Pigneur found a pattern of how entrepreneurs use a visual 
representation of their business model to answer these questions. They used these findings to 
develop a Business Model Canvas that provides entrepreneurs with a dynamic framework to 
guide them through the process of developing, testing, and refining their business models (see 
Figure 4.8). The canvas is comprised of nine elements:
1. Customer segments. A good business model always starts with the customer. The
entrepreneur’s first step is to identify a segment of customers who have a clearly defined 
need. In the previous steps outlined in this chapter, the entrepreneur begins to define the 
market for the new business. For most entrepreneurs, the initial market is defined much too 
broadly. The entrepreneur uses demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, and other char-
acteristics that add specificity to defining the target market. Narrowing the target market 
enables a small company to focus its limited resources on serving the needs of a specific

group of customers rather than attempting to satisfy the desires of the mass market. Creat-
ing a successful business depends on an entrepreneur’s ability to attract real customers who 
are willing and able to spend real money to buy its products or services. Perhaps the worst 
marketing error an entrepreneur can commit is failing to define a target market and trying 
to make the business “everything to everybody.” Small companies usually are much more 
successful focusing on a specific market niche or niches where they can excel at meeting 
customers’ special needs or wants. Who is it, specifically, that has the needs the new busi-
ness will be addressing with its products and/or services? It may be a market niche. It may 
be a mass market. Or it may be a segmented market based on age, gender, geography, or 
socioeconomic grouping.
2. Value proposition. A compelling value proposition is at the heart of every successful
business. The value proposition is the collection of products and/or services the business
will offer to meet the needs of the customers. It is all the things that will set the business 
apart from its competitors, such as pricing, quality, features, product availability, and other 
features. Most value propositions for new businesses come from fundamental macro trends 
within the economy, demographics, technology, or society and culture discussed earlier in 
the chapter. Trends lead to changes within industries. These trends are first uncovered in 
the industry and market feasibility analysis. A fundamental role of being an entrepreneur 
is to find solutions for the problems and needs customers have that result from the change 
that follows disruptive trends such as these. It could be something about the product itself, 
such as its price and value, features, performance, durability, or design, or it might be 
something emanating from the personnel of the company, including their expertise, 
responsiveness, or reliability.
It is best to identify and focus on one or two benefits that will make the new busi-
ness stand out to customers and motivate them to purchase from the new business. The 
best way to develop the key benefits that are at the heart of a strong value proposition 
is to listen to customers. Although entrepreneurs may think they know what their cus-
tomers want, most of the time they will not have it quite right. The entrepreneur will 
probably have to adjust the product or service to fit it with what the customer actually 
wants or needs.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: George Bukhov and Burger & Lobster Less than 
two years after opening his first location, George Bukhov expanded his Burger & 
Lobster restaurants to four locations across London, England. Burger & Lobster’s business
model offers a meal that feels like an indulgence at a price point that most people can afford. 
It is not unusual for a Burger & Lobster restaurant to serve 1,000 customers per day on week-
ends. Even on weeknights the wait to get into a Burger & Lobster can reach two hours. To
keep customers engaged while waiting for their tables, Burger & Lobster offers a large bar
area that plays classic Motown music in a fun and lively atmosphere. Once seated, patrons
choose from a limited menu of burgers or lobster, which helps control quality and costs. By
finding a winning value proposition, Bukhov created a business with high quality, high sales 
volume, and high profit margins.21 ■
3. Customer relationships. Not every business provides the same type and same level of cus-
tomer service. This is what defines the customer relationship in the business model. For 
example, several effective business models provide meals to consumers. Customers may
choose to buy food from a vending machine, a fast-food restaurant, a fast casual sit-down 
restaurant, or an exclusive fine dining establishment. Each of these business models has
a very different approach to define the relationship with customers. The vending business 
offers quick, convenient, and impersonal service. At the other extreme, the fine dining 
restaurant works closely and personally with customers to ensure they get exactly what 
they want. Each approach is effective and appropriate for its particular target market. When
developing this segment of the business model, the entrepreneur must answer several 
questions. How do customers want to interact with the business? Do they want intensive 
personal service, or would they rather have limited engagement or even automated interac-
tion? There is no one best approach to customer relationship for all businesses, but there 
usually is one best approach for each particular business model.

168
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
4. Channels. In the business model canvas, channels refer to both communication channels 
(promotion) and distribution channels (product placement). Communication channels de-
fine how the customers seek out information about this type of product. Where do potential 
customers go to when they want to get information about products and services? It could 
be Web sites, social networks, blogs, advertisements, experts, and so forth. Again, there is
no one best way to communicate for all businesses, but there will be one or more that is 
most effective with the specific target market for a given business model. The distribution 
channel defines the most effective way to get products to the customers for this type of 
business. For some business models it may be best to use in-home sales through Web sites 
such as Amazon because the target market may prefer to order online from the comfort of 
their living rooms. For other business models, the customer may want to see the merchan-
dise, touch it, and interact with it in an exciting new retail location. The entrepreneur must 
determine where the customer wants to make the purchase and then determine the most 
effective way to get it to the customer at that location.
5. Key activities. What important things must the entrepreneur do to ensure a successful 
launch and to sustain the growth of the business? In the business model, the goal is to build
a basic checklist of what needs to be done to open the business and what activities are nec-
essary to ensure its long-term success. The development of the business plan will then take
this list and expand on it in much greater detail. We will explore creating a business plan in
detail in Chapter 5.
6. Key resources. What are the human, capital, and intellectual resources needed for the 
business to be successful? Again, this will serve as an initial checklist to ensure that the 
entrepreneur has identified all key resources necessary to support a successful launch and
to sustain the business as it grows. The business plan provides the opportunity to explain 
these in much greater detail and develop all necessary cost estimates for the financial 
forecasts.
7. Key partners. This segment of the business model includes key suppliers, key outsourcing 
partners, investors, industry partners, advisers, and all other external businesses or entities
that are critical to make the business model work. Entrepreneurs cannot expect to become 
successful all by themselves. They must build a network of relationships when launching 
and growing their businesses.
8. Revenue streams. How will the value proposition generate revenue? Will it be a one-time 
sale, ongoing fees, advertising, or some other sources of cash into the business? The 
entrepreneur should answer these questions using the information discovered in the value 
proposition, customer segments, customer relationship, and channel components of the 
business model (the right side of the business model canvas). The revenue streams infor-
mation serves as the framework for the more detailed revenue forecasts developed for the 
business plan.
9. Cost structure. What are the fixed and variable costs that are necessary to make the busi-
ness model work? The key activities, key resources, and key partners components of the 
plan (the left side of the business model canvas) identify the basic types of costs and give
some estimate of their scope. Just like the revenue streams, the cost structure of the busi-
ness model becomes the framework for developing more detailed costs that the entrepre-
neur will incorporate into the financial forecasts of the business plan. Chapter 11 examines 
the financial plan in more detail.
Developing a business model is a four-phase process22 (see Figure 4.9). The first phase is
to create an initial business model canvas, as outlined previously. It is best to do this on a white
board, on the wall using Post-it Notes, or using free business model software such as Business
Model Fiddle (www.bmfiddle.com). As the entrepreneur goes through the next three phases, the
business model will change. At this point in the process, much of the information in the business
model is only a series of hypotheses to be tested. The entrepreneur will update the business model

CHAPTER 4 • CONDUCTING A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGNING A BUSINESS MODEL
169
 as he or she learns more about the customers and the resources it will take to launch and grow 
the business. The business model canvas allows all of the team members involved in the start-up 
to work from a common framework. The team documents all of the hypotheses about the busi-
ness model that require further investigation and keeps track of changes in the model that result 
from testing the hypotheses. The entrepreneurial team also estimates the total market size and 
the size of the specific target market that would be feasible to attract to the new business when 
it launches.
The second phase in designing the business model is to test the problem that the team thinks 
the business solves through its core value proposition. This is best done with primary research
data. That means the entrepreneurial team must “get out of the office” and test the model with 
real customers. By engaging potential customers early in the development of a new business and
listening to what they have to say, the team has a much better chance of developing a business
model that will attract customers. By engaging with real customers, the entrepreneurial team asks 
the following questions:23
● Do we really understand the customer problem the business model is trying to address?
● Do these customers care enough about this problem to spend their hard-earned money on 
our product?
● Do these customers care enough about our product to help us by telling others through 
word-of-mouth?
By answering these questions the entrepreneur assesses the actual need for the product and the 
intensity of that need.
The third phase is to test the solution to the problem in the market. One technique to test the 
solution offered by the business model involves business prototyping, in which entrepreneurs 
test their business models on a small scale before committing significant resources to launch a
business that might not work. Business prototyping recognizes that every business idea is a hy-
pothesis that must be tested before an entrepreneur takes it to full scale. If the test supports the 
hypothesis and its accompanying assumptions, the entrepreneur takes the next step of building a
business plan. If the prototype flops, the entrepreneur scraps the business idea with only minimal 
losses and turns to the next idea.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Chris Fitzgerald and Neoteric Hovercraft Golf Cart
Chris Fitzgerald launched Neoteric Hovercraft to offer affordable, small hovercraft vehicles 
for a variety of applications. The advantage of a hovercraft is that it can easily and smoothly
travel on a cushion of air at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour over a variety of terrain, including
water. Neoteric’s primary customers for its hovercrafts are police and fire departments, the U.S.
Air Force, and Disney World. One model developed by Neoteric is a hovercraft golf cart, which
can hold up to four people and two sets of golf clubs. Windy Knoll Golf Club in Springfield,
Ohio, bought two hovercraft golf carts to assess the feasibility of everyday use of the devices on
a golf course and customer interest in paying the significant cost difference of a hovercraft 
versus a traditional golf cart. The hovercraft golf cart costs about 10 times the cost of a gas or 
electric cart.24 ■
The Internet is a valuable business prototyping tool because it gives entrepreneurs easy and
inexpensive access to real live potential customers. Entrepreneurs can test their ideas by selling 
their products on established sites such as eBay or by setting up their own Web sites to gauge 
customers’ response. A process that can guide testing early versions of a product or service is 
known as lean start-up, which is defined as a process of rapidly developing simple prototypes to 
test key assumptions by engaging real customers.25
To launch a business using the lean start-up process, entrepreneurs begin with what is called
a minimal viable product, which is the simplest version of a product or service with which an 
entrepreneur can create a sustainable business. Dropbox was founded in 2007 by Drew Houston
and Arash Ferdowsi as a free service that lets users easily share photos, documents, and videos
among any devices using their software. When developing the idea for their business, they knew 
that it would take years to create the software to power it and that developing a simple working 
prototype was not possible. To test their idea, they created a three-minute video that demonstrated 
how their new product would work once it was fully developed. The video drove hundreds of 
thousands of viewers to their Web site and created a long waiting list of people willing to use the 
product in its beta version. The high level of interest convinced the founders and the investment 
community that Dropbox was a product for which there was strong demand. Dropbox now has 
more than 50 million users around the globe and has raised $257 million in funding.26
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Aayush Phumbhra and Chegg The original business 
model of Chegg was to establish a site like Craigslist that specialized in connecting college
students with each other to offer things they wanted to buy and sell. Company cofounder Aayush
Phumbhra noticed that most of the traffic at the site was buying and selling textbooks. Phumbhra 
wondered whether students would just rather rent their books and avoid the hassle of buying and 
selling their textbooks every semester. To test the hypothesis, Chegg purchased 2,000 used text-
books online and sent out e-mails to customers about the new service. Within a short time, Chegg’s
customers clearly demonstrated their preference for renting over buying and selling. Based on the 
success of the market experiment, Phumbhra pivoted the business model to one that focuses on
renting textbooks to college students. Chegg now rents more than a million textbooks each year
and employees 150 people.27 ■
The fourth phase of designing a business model is to make changes and adjustments in the
business, called pivots, based on what the entrepreneur learns from engaging the market about 
the problem and the solution that the new business intends to pursue. Some pivots may be subtle 
adjustments to the business model, while others may be fundamental changes to key parts of the
model, including in the value proposition, markets served, or ideal revenue streams. There are 
three major types of pivots:
● Product pivot. The features that make up a product may not match what the customer 
really wants or needs. Sometimes the entrepreneur adds features that are not really impor-
tant to the customer. Although customers may be willing to accept these features as part 
of the product, they are not willing to pay extra for them. This creates a product that is not 
clearly focused on the market need: It costs more than it should due to the extra features. 
For example, when Paul Orfalea founded his first Kinko’s store (now FedEx Office), he 
sold a variety of school and office supplies to his fellow University of Southern California 
students. He also had a copy machine in the back of the store. Students did not buy many

CHAPTER 4 • CONDUCTING A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGNING A BUSINESS MODEL
171
Entrepreneurs create minimal viable products to allow them to test 
their product with real customers as quickly as possible. Testing
the product this way helps to determine whether consumers really 
want the product, provides feedback from these customers to help 
improve the product, and gathers hard data that demonstrates the
proof of concept many investors want before they fund an emerg-
ing business.
Judson Aikens wanted to start a business but had a good pay-
ing job and was concerned about taking on too much risk. While
brainstorming about possible businesses he could launch, Aikens
came up for an idea for a new dating app. He had observed that it 
is easy to meet new people at places like dog parks.
Aikens’s idea was to develop an app called RendezWoof that 
created a virtual dog park. “The app would not only connect dog 
owners with each other, it would connect them with dog-friendly 
resources around them,” says Aikens. “Using GPS, the app’s map 
would populate restaurants with patios and parks convenient to 
users interested in meeting up to grab a beer or throw a Frisbee.”
Aikens reached out to an entrepreneur, Ben Dolgoff, who 
had spoken to one of the entrepreneurship classes he had taken 
in graduate school. Ben was an experienced app developer who 
had developed and launched several successful apps. After asking 
Ben to sign a nondisclosure agreement, Aikens shared his idea. 
Ben said he thought the app had promise as a commercially viable
product. He suggested that Aikens develop some designs for his 
idea and then get back with him. If the idea had promise, Ben 
said he might be willing to develop the app in exchange for some 
equity in the new business.
Aikens shared his app idea with a friend who was a graphic
designer. She was eager to help him with the designs and was 
willing to provide ongoing graphic design services in exchange 
for equity.
The next step was for Aikens to work with the graphic de-
signer to develop a wireframe of the app. A wireframe is a draw-
ing of the various screens that make up an app; it includes the
kinds of information displayed, the functions of the app, and the 
basic flow from screen to screen.
Aikens took the wireframe designs to Ben, who was eager to 
move forward. Ben’s company would develop the app in exchange 
for equity.
“This arrangement was very acceptable to me,” says Aikens. 
“It simultaneously removed the financial burden of development 
and provided an experienced go-to consultant I could work with 
through the life of the app.”
Aikens formed an LLC and secured the RendezWoof name 
on all social platforms and for the Web domain. He opened an 
Apple developer account and applied for copyrights and trademarks.
Because he is still working his day job, Aikens spends many late
nights working with the developers to improve the app’s user in-
terface and user experience.
Because the goal of the initial version of the app is to gain 
users and prove the concept, RendezWoof initially offered the
app for free through the Apple Store. Future versions of the app 
will have more features, which will allow the company to charge 
a small fee for the app.
1. Why would you recommend that an entrepreneur develop a 
minimal viable product or a prototype?
2. Can you think of additional market research that Aikens 
could have done before developing his product?
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of offering
equity in exchange for work done on a new product?

supplies, but they were constantly using the copy machine. He narrowed his offering to 
become primarily a copy shop and grew the business to a multinational company with 
more than 1,200 locations. On the other hand, sometimes the entrepreneur does not offer 
enough features to fully address the customers’ problem. In this situation, the entrepreneur 
must add the additional features the customer expects.
● Customer pivot. Although a product might solve a real market problem or need, some-
times the initial business model targets the wrong customer segment or even the wrong 
market. For example, PayPal targeted the handheld device market that included the Palm 
Pilot for its electronic payment system. However, the founders of PayPal soon realized 
by listening to customer feedback that there was a much larger market for its product.
Businesses were beginning to engage in commerce on their Web sites. PayPal pivoted its
business model and as a result rapidly grew to become a $1.6 billion company facilitating 
Internet commerce.
● Revenue model pivot. There are many ways in which the revenue model may pivot. One 
of the most basic revenue decisions is whether to use a high margin/low volume model or 
low margin/high volume model. For example, Best Buy began as a single location stereo
equipment store called the Sound of Music back in the 1960s. Like all of its competitors, 
the revenue model was high margin/low volume. The owners would mark up inventory 
two to three times what the product cost them to purchase. As a result, the store would 
turn its inventory over about once a year. After a tornado destroyed the building but left 
the inventory undamaged, the Sound of Music owners rented a large tent and ran a dras-
tic sale. The demand was so overwhelming that when they reopened, they changed their 
revenue model to low margin/high volume and within a short time renamed the business 
Best Buy. The low prices created so much demand that the stores would sell their entire 
inventory about once a month, rather than once a year. Other revenue model pivots change 
the type of payment received. The model may change from a single payment to recurring 
revenue, or it may shift from hourly billing to charging a fixed price per service. Social
entrepreneurs can pivot from a revenue model based on a nonprofit that raises money 
through grants and donations to a social enterprise that generates revenues from a product 
or service.
Several minor pivots may also be necessary for a business model around operational aspects of 
the business, including promotion, distribution, staffing, or outsourcing.
If pivots to the existing business model are not enough, occasionally a company may com-
pletely change its business model. For example, when IBM was facing possible failure in the
1990s, the company drastically shifted its business model from a company that manufactured 
and sold computer and other office hardware to focus primarily on software and information
technology consulting. It is now one of the largest and most profitable information technology 
companies in the world.
Conclusion
Entrepreneurs can follow five steps to guide the process of turning a great new idea into a 
successful business. This chapter examines the first three steps in this process.
The best business ideas start with a group of customers with a common problem or need. 
Once entrepreneurs develop ideas for new businesses, the first step is to assess these ideas by 
examining a need in the market, developing a solution for that need, and determining the entre-
preneur’s ability to successfully turn the idea into a business. The idea assessment process helps
an entrepreneur more efficiently and effectively examine multiple ideas to identify the solution
with the most potential.
The second step is to conduct a feasibility analysis to determine whether the entrepreneur 
can transform the idea into a viable business. The role of a feasibility analysis is to serve as a
filter, screening out ideas that lack the potential for building a successful business, before an 
entrepreneur commits the necessary resources to develop and test a business model or to build a
business plan.

CHAPTER 4 • CONDUCTING A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGNING A BUSINESS MODEL
173
The third step in the process of evaluating ideas is to develop and test the business model.
Developing a business model helps the entrepreneur better understand all that will be required 
to launch and build the business. In this step in the planning process, the entrepreneur tests the
concept and uses what he or she learned from real customers to refine the business model before
committing the resources to grow the business to its full potential.
Once the entrepreneur completes the idea assessment, feasibility study, and business model
steps, he or she is ready to develop a business plan. As the business becomes more successful, 
the strategic plan becomes an essential management tool. The business plan and strategic plan
are covered in Chapter 5.
Jake Jorgovan had become a successful entrepreneur while he was 
in college. Jorgovan and a classmate started a video production 
company. They began by making videos of senior recitals for music
students at their school. By the time they had graduated, their
company had hired several employees and was booked up with a
combination of music industry work and shoots for corporate cli-
ents needing videos. Jorgovan won several local and national busi-
ness plan competitions based on the plans he developed for the 
company. Shortly after graduation, Jorgovan was recognized as 
the Youth Entrepreneur of the Year in Nashville, Tennessee, where
the business was headquartered.
Not long after that, Jorgovan made the decision to move 
away from the video industry and start a new business. After ex-
tensive research, Jorgovan identified an opportunity within the
healthcare industry. Telemedicine was a growth sector within the 
industry. Jorgovan started his new company, Telehealth PT, to
develop a telemedicine application for physical therapists. Tele-
health’s business model was to provide a framework that would
allow physical therapists to provide care through live video confer-
encing sessions on patients’ mobile devices or computers.
Jorgovan began developing the basic technology he could use 
to demonstrate that his concept could work. His goal was to offer a 
simple version of the product and test it with a few physical therapy
clinics. However, not long after beginning work on the basic prod-
uct, Jorgovan began to have doubts about his ability to get the 
business launched. He persevered, trying to overcome the many
technical hurdles and personal challenges the new business kept 
throwing in front of his path.
Even though it soon became clear that his new business was 
not going to work, Jorgovan had a hard time accepting this fail-
ure, mainly because he had known so much success with his previ-
ous business. He continued to try to uncover ways to salvage the
venture, but eventually he had to admit he had failed.
One of the possible outcomes of conducting feasibility analy-
ses and developing business models is that, like Jake Jorgovan, 
the entrepreneur discovers the business just won’t work. Entre-
preneurs should consider this a positive outcome because they are
able to discover fatal flaws in a business concept early, saving time 
and money. The reality is that it can be hard for entrepreneurs to
admit failure and walk away from an idea even when it becomes 
clear it is doomed to fail. Why? What clouds their judgment?
•
Pride and ego. It is easy for entrepreneurs to let their egos 
get too wrapped up in their businesses, even very early 
in the life of their new ventures. They receive affirmation
and encouragement from family and friends for taking 
the risk to start a business. Soon, their pride in being 
an entrepreneur can get in the way of making a sound 
business decision and closing a failing venture.
•
Their “baby.” Many long and lonely hours go into getting 
a business started. Entrepreneurs can quickly become emo-
tionally attached to the new venture. They can reach a point 
where they could not even imagine thinking about giving 
up on it.
•
Getting stuck on sunk costs. It can be difficult for entre-
preneurs to look at the time, money, and reputation they 
have put into a failing concept as a sunk cost. That is, entre-
preneurs can never recover the resources they have already 
committed to a venture.
The purpose of feasibility analysis is to ask the question: Can this 
business work? Sometimes the answer will be “no.” The entre-
preneur must be ready to accept this answer and move on to the 
next opportunity.
1. Why was it hard for Jake to admit his newest venture was 
not going to work?
2. What would you recommend that entrepreneurs do to 
ensure they don’t hang on too long to a failed business 
concept?
3. A failed business concept does not mean the entrepreneur 
has failed. How would you explain this to an entrepreneur 
facing a failed business concept?

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Describe the process of conducting an idea 
assessment.
●An idea sketch pad is a tool that helps entrepreneurs 
assess ideas. The idea sketch pad has five parameters:
Customers. Start with a group of customers who 
have a clear need that is not being addressed.
Offering. Describe your idea for a product or 
service to offer the customers.
Value proposition. Explain why your product or 
service will be important to customers.
Core competencies. Determine if your offering has 
any technologies or unique features that will help 
differentiate it from competitors?
People. Identify the key people on the team who 
will launch this business.
2. Explain the elements of a feasibility analysis.
●Determine how attractive an industry is overall as a
“home” for a new business.
●Evaluate possible niches a small business can 
occupy profitably.
3. Describe the six forces in the macro 
environment of an industry.
●Sociocultural trends can lead to dramatic changes, 
creating whole new industries and fundamentally 
transforming existing industries.
●Technological breakthroughs lead to the develop-
ment of new products and entirely new industries.
●Changing demographics create opportunities for 
entrepreneurs.
●Economic trends, both positive and negative, create 
opportunities.
●Political and legal change, such as new laws and
regulations, create opportunities for entrepreneurs.
●Global trends that open global markets allow 
businesses to seek customers and suppliers from
all corners of the world and can help in even the 
smallest business.
4. Understand how Porter’s Five Forces Model 
assesses the competitive environment.
●Entrepreneurs should assess five forces that shape 
the competitive environment for every business:
The rivalry among competing firms
The bargaining power of suppliers
The bargaining power of buyers
The threat of new entrants
The threat of substitute products or services
5. Describe the various methods of conducting 
primary and secondary market research.
●Primary research tools include customer surveys, 
focus groups, building prototypes, conducting 
in-home trials, and “windshield” research (driving 
around and observing the competition).
●Secondary research gathers existing data from 
trade associations and business directories, industry 
databases, demographic data, census data, forecasts 
compiled by government agencies, market research 
reports, articles in magazines and journals, local
data, and the Internet.
6. Understand the four major elements of a 
financial feasibility analysis.
●Capital requirements. Start-up companies
often need capital to purchase equipment, 
buildings, technology, and other tangible assets 
and to hire and train employees, promote their 
products and services, and establish a presence in 
the market.
●Estimated earnings. In addition to producing an 
estimate of the start-up company’s capital require-
ments, an entrepreneur should forecast the earning 
potential of the proposed business.
●Time out of cash. To estimate time out of cash, 
take the negative cash flow from the business each 
month and divide by how much available cash is left 
in the business. This gives the number of months the
business can survive at its current rate of negative 
cash flow.
●Return on investment. A venture must produce an 
attractive rate of return relative to the level of risk 
it requires. This risk–return tradeoff means that 
the higher the level of risk a prospective business
involves, the higher the rate of return it must 
provide to the entrepreneur and investors.
7. Describe the process of assessing entrepreneur 
feasibility.
●Many new businesses require that an entrepreneur 
possess a certain set of knowledge, experiences, and 
skills to have a chance of being successful.
●Entrepreneurial readiness also involves issues such
as temperament and work ethic.
8. Describe the nine elements of a business 
model.
●Customer segments. A good business model always
starts with the customer. The entrepreneur’s first 
step is to identify a segment of customers who have 
a clearly defined need.

CHAPTER 4 • CONDUCTING A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGNING A BUSINESS MODEL
175
●Key resources. This will serve as an initial checklist 
to ensure that all key resources have been identified 
that will support a successful launch and sustain the 
business as it grows.
●Key partners. This segment of the business model 
includes important suppliers, outsourcing partners, 
investors, industry partners, advisers, and all other 
external businesses or entities that are critical to 
make the business model work.
●Revenue streams. How will the value proposition 
generate revenue?
●Cost structure. The key activities, key resources,
and key partners components of the plan help iden-
tify the basic types of costs and give some estimate
of their scope.
●Value proposition. The value proposition is the 
collection of products and/or services the business 
will offer to meet customers’ needs.
●Customer relationships. Not every business pro-
vides the same type and same level of customer 
service.
●Channels. Channels refer to both communication 
channels (promotion) and distribution channels 
(product placement). Communication channels 
define how the customers seek out information 
about this type of product. The distribution channel 
defines the most effective way to get products to the 
customers for this type of business.
●Key activities. The goal is to build a basic checklist 
of what needs to be done to open the business and 
what activities are necessary to ensure its long-term 
success.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
A business plan is a planning tool that builds on the foundation of the idea assessment, feasibil-
ity analysis, and business model discussed in Chapter 4. A business plan provides a more com-
prehensive and detailed analysis than the first three steps in the new business planning process.
Together with a well-developed business model, it functions primarily as a planning tool describ-
ing in greater detail how to turn the model into a successful business. The primary goals of the 
business plan are to guide entrepreneurs as they launch their businesses and to help them acquire
the necessary financing to launch. Research suggests that, whatever their size, companies that 
engage in business planning outperform those that do not. A business plan offers:
● a systematic, realistic evaluation of a venture’s chances for success in the market.
● a way to determine the principal risks facing the venture.
● a “game plan” for managing the business successfully during its start-up.
● a tool for comparing actual results against targeted performance.
● an important tool for attracting capital in the challenging hunt for money.
Few activities in the life of a business are as vital—or as overlooked—as that of developing 
a strategy for success that guides a business beyond the start-up detailed in the business plan.
Companies without clear strategies may achieve some success in the short run, but as soon as
competitive conditions stiffen or an unanticipated threat arises, they usually “hit the wall” and 
fold. Without a basis for differentiating itself from a pack of similar competitors, the best a com-
pany can hope for is mediocrity in the marketplace.
In today’s global competitive environment, any business, large or small, that is not think-
ing and acting strategically is extremely vulnerable. Every business is exposed to the forces of a 
rapidly changing competitive environment, and in the future small business executives can expect 
even greater change and uncertainty. From sweeping political changes around the planet and 
rapid technology advances to more intense competition and newly emerging global markets, the 
business environment has become more turbulent and challenging to business owners. Although
this market turbulence creates many challenges for small businesses, it also creates opportunities
for those companies that have in place strategies to capitalize on them. Entrepreneurs’ willing-
ness to adapt, to create change, to experiment with new business models, and to break tradi-
tional rules has become more important than ever. “It’s not the strongest or the most intelligent 
[companies that] survive,” says American Express CEO Ken Chenault, “but those most adaptive
to change.”1
The Benefits of Creating a Business Plan
When based on the foundation of a fully developed and tested business model, a well-conceived
and factually based business plan increases the likelihood of success of a new business. For 
decades, research has proved that companies that engage in business planning outperform those 
that do not. One study by the Small Business Administration reports that entrepreneurs who write 
business plans early on are two-and-a-half times more likely to actually start their businesses 
than those who do not.2 Unfortunately, many entrepreneurs never take the time to engage in the
new business planning process, of which the business plan is an important element. The impli-
cations of the lack of planning are all too evident in the high failure rates that small companies 
experience.
A business plan is a written summary of an entrepreneur’s proposed business venture, its 
operational and financial details, its marketing opportunities and strategy, and its managers’ skills
and abilities. There is no substitute for a well-prepared business plan, and there are no shortcuts 
to creating one. The plan serves as an entrepreneur’s road map on the journey toward building 
a successful business. A business plan describes which direction the company is taking, what 
its goals are, where it wants to be, and how it intends to get there. The plan is written proof 
that an entrepreneur has performed the necessary research, has studied the business opportunity
adequately, and is prepared to capitalize on it with a sound business model. Crafting a business
plan is an entrepreneur’s last insurance against launching a business destined to fail or mismanag-
ing a potentially successful company.

CHAPTER 5 • CRAFTING A BUSINESS PLAN AND BUILDING A SOLID STRATEGIC PLAN
179
A business plan serves two essential functions. First, it provides a battery of tools—a
mission statement, goals, objectives, budgets, financial forecasts, target markets, and entry 
strategies—to help entrepreneurs subject their ideas to one last test of reality before launching the 
business. The business plan also helps the entrepreneur to lead the company successfully through
its launch and early start-up phases.
The second function of the business plan is to attract lenders and investors. A business
plan must prove to potential lenders and investors that a venture will be able to repay loans 
and produce an attractive rate of return. They want proof that an entrepreneur has evalu-
ated the risk involved in the new venture realistically and has a strategy for addressing it. 
Unfortunately, many small business owners approach potential lenders and investors without 
having prepared to sell their business concepts. Given the increased challenges in funding small
businesses since the beginning of the recession in 2008, being prepared for any funding meeting 
has become even more important. Tim Williamson, cofounder of The Idea Village, an incuba-
tor for entrepreneurs, says that of the thousands of entrepreneurs seeking funding, only about 
1 percent are ready to get the money.3 A collection of figures scribbled on a note pad to support a
loan application or investment request is not enough. Applying for loans or attempting to attract 
investors without a solid business plan rarely lands needed capital. The best way to secure the 
necessary capital is to prepare a sound business plan. The quality of an entrepreneur’s business 
plan weighs heavily in the final decision to lend or invest funds. It is also potential lenders’ and 
investors’ first impression of the company and its managers. Therefore, the finished product 
should be highly polished and professional in both form and content.
Preparing a sound business plan requires time and effort, but the benefits greatly exceed the 
costs. Building a plan forces a potential entrepreneur to look at his or her business idea in the 
harsh light of reality by putting the concepts developed in the business model into specific detail.
To get external financing, an entrepreneur’s plan must pass three tests with potential lenders and
investors: (1) the reality test, (2) the competitive test, and (3) the value test. The first two tests
have both an external and internal component:
REALITY TEST The external component of the reality test involves proving that a market for the 
product or service really does exist. It focuses on industry attractiveness, market niches, potential
customers, market size, degree of competition, and similar factors. Entrepreneurs who pass this part 
of the reality test prove in the marketing portion of their business plans that there is strong demand
for their business idea. Evidence that is gathered during the testing of the business model should 
be an integral part of the marketing plan to bolster the proof for the idea using real customers.
The internal component of the reality test focuses on the product or service itself. Can the 
company really build it for the cost estimates in the business plan? Is it truly different from what 
competitors are already selling? Does it offer customers something of value?
COMPETITIVE TEST The external part of the competitive test evaluates the company’s relative 
position to its key competitors. How do the company’s strengths and weaknesses match up with 
those of the competition? Do these reactions threaten the new company’s success and survival?
Recall from Chapter 4 that a compelling value proposition must clearly define the problem the target 
market is facing. Are current choices to address the problem for target market unworkable? Is some 
sort of solution for the problem facing the target market inevitable? Is the problem urgent, critical, 
and clear for the target market? Is the target market underserved? Successful entrepreneurs carefully 
and honestly evaluate the strength of their product ideas. Do we offer a solution that looks at the 
problem differently than competitors? Can we protect our intellectual property (if applicable) and/
or create a protectable niche? Do we disrupt the market but not so much that the “cost” of changing 
to us is too high? A value proposition that is properly constructed answers the following questions:4
● Who is our target market?
● What current options exist for this target market?
● What do/will we offer the target market?
● What is the key problem it solves?
● Why is it better than other options the target market has to choose from?

A strong and compelling value proposition guides everything entrepreneurs and their employees 
do while starting and growing their businesses.5
The internal competitive test focuses on management’s ability to create a company that will 
gain an edge over existing rivals. To pass this part of the competitive test, a plan must prove the 
quality, skill, and experience of the venture’s management team. What other resources does the 
company have that can give it a competitive edge in the market?
VALUE TEST To convince lenders and investors to put their money into the venture, a business 
plan must prove to them that it offers a high probability of repayment or an attractive rate of 
return. Entrepreneurs usually see their businesses as good investments because they consider the 
intangibles of owning a business, such as gaining control over their own destinies and freedom
to do what they enjoy. Lenders and investors, however, look at a venture in colder terms: dollar-
for-dollar returns. A plan must convince lenders they will be repaid the money they lend to the 
business, and it must convince investors they will earn an attractive return on their money.
Even after completing a feasibility analysis and building a business model, entrepreneurs 
sometimes do not come to the realization that “this business just won’t work” until they build a
business plan. Have they wasted valuable time? Not at all! The time to find out that a business
idea will not succeed is in the planning stages before committing significant money, time, and
effort to the venture. It is much less expensive to make mistakes on paper than in reality. In other 
cases, a business plan reveals important problems to overcome before launching a company. 
Exposing these flaws and then addressing them enhances the chances of a venture’s success.
Business plans also help nascent entrepreneurs nail down important aspects of their concept and 
sometimes prevent costly mistakes.
The real value in preparing a plan is not as much in the plan itself as it is in the process the 
entrepreneur goes through to create the plan—from the idea assessment, to the feasibility analy-
sis, through the development and testing of the business model, and finally with the crafting of 
the written business plan. Although the finished product is extremely useful, the process of build-
ing the plan requires entrepreneurs to explore all areas of the business and subject their ideas to 
an objective, critical evaluation from many different angles. What entrepreneurs learn about their 
industry, target customers, financial requirements, competition, and other factors is essential to 
making their ventures successful. Building a business plan is one controllable factor that can
reduce the risk and uncertainty of launching a company.
The Elements of a Business Plan
Wise entrepreneurs recognize that every business plan is unique and must be tailor-made. They 
avoid the off-the-shelf, “cookie-cutter” approach that produces a look-alike business plan. The
elements of a business plan may be standard, but the way entrepreneurs tell their stories should 
be unique and reflect the specific strengths of their business model, the experience of their team, 
their personality and how it will shape the culture of the business, and their enthusiasm for the 
new venture. In fact, the best business plans usually are those that tell a compelling story in 
addition to the facts. For those making a first attempt at writing a business plan, seeking the 
advice of individuals with experience in this process often proves helpful. Accountants, busi-
ness professors, attorneys, advisers working with local chapters of the Service Corps of Retired 
Executives (SCORE), and consultants with Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) are
excellent sources of guidance when creating and refining a plan. (For a list of SBDCs, go to 
the Small Business Administration Web site and see its SBDC Web page; for a list of SCORE
chapters, go to the SCORE Web site). Remember, however, you should be the one to author your 
business plan, not someone else. A sample outline of a business plan is displayed at the end of 
this chapter.
Initially, the prospect of writing a business plan may appear to be overwhelming. Many 
entrepreneurs would rather launch their companies and “see what happens” than invest the neces-
sary time and energy defining and researching their target markets, defining their strategies, and 
mapping out their finances. After all, building a plan is hard work—it requires time, effort, and
thought. However, in reality the entrepreneur should do both. By getting started and seeing what 
happens, the entrepreneur can test and improve the basic business model. The plan is essential

as the entrepreneur gets ready to build the business and scale its growth. The business plan pays
many dividends, but not all of them are immediately apparent. Entrepreneurs who invest their 
time and energy building plans are better prepared to face the hostile environment in which their 
companies will compete than those who do not.
Entrepreneurs can use business planning software available from several companies to create 
their plans. Some of the most popular programs include Business Plan Pro (Palo Alto Software), 
PlanMaker (Power Solutions for Business), and Plan Write (Business Resources Software). 
These packages help entrepreneurs organize the material they have researched and gathered, and 
they provide helpful tips on plan writing with templates for creating financial statements. Busi-
ness planning software may help to produce professional-looking business plans with a potential
drawback: The plans they produce look as if they came from the same mold. That can be a turn-
off for professional investors who review hundreds of business plans each year. Entrepreneurs 
benefit by making the content and appearance of their plan look professional and unique.
In the past, conventional wisdom was that business plans should be 20 to 40 pages in length, 
depending on the complexity of the business. More recently experts have begun to recommend 
that plans should be shorter, typically suggesting that they be limited to 10 to 20 pages. There is
mixed opinion on how complex the financial forecasts should be. If the forecasts are based on 
evidence that is substantiated by testing the business model, more detail will strengthen your 
case. If the numbers appear to be unsubstantiated or even fabricated, more detail can actually hurt 
the presentation. In many ways, having to write shorter business plans can make writing them 
even more of a challenge. A shorter business plan does not mean that any of the elements of the 
plan be omitted. Instead the entrepreneur must work hard to communicate all of the key aspects 
of the plan as succinctly as possible. Although entrepreneurs find it difficult to communicate all 
the important elements of their story within the shorter page length recommendations, they run 
the risk of never getting used or read if their plans get too long.
This section explains the most common elements of a business plan. However, entrepreneurs
must recognize that, like every business venture, every business plan is unique. An entrepreneur 
should use the following elements as the starting point for building a plan and should modify 
them as needed to better tell the story of his or her new venture.
TITLE PAGE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS A business plan should contain a title page with the
company’s name, logo, and address as well as the names and contact information of the company
founders. Many entrepreneurs also include the copy number of the plan and the date on which 
it was issued on the title page. Business plan readers appreciate a table of contents that includes 
page numbers so that they can locate the particular sections of the plan in which they are most 
interested.
THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY To summarize the presentation to each potential financial institution 
or investors, the entrepreneur should write an executive summary. It should be concise—a 
maximum of one page—and should summarize all of the relevant points of the proposed deal. 
After reading the executive summary, anyone should be able to understand the entire business
concept, the attributes that differentiate the company from the competition, and the financing that 
is being requested. The executive summary is a synopsis of the entire plan, capturing its essence
in a capsulized form. It should explain the basic business model and the problem the business
will solve for customers, briefly describing the owners and key employees, target market(s), 
financial highlights (e.g., sales and earnings projections, the loan or investment requested, plans 
for using the funds, and projections for repaying any loans or cashing out investments), and the
company’s competitive advantage. The executive summary is a written version of what is known 
as “the elevator pitch.” Imagine yourself on an elevator with a potential lender or investor. Only 
the two of you are on the elevator, and you have that person’s undivided attention for the duration 
of the ride, but the building is not very tall! To convince the investor that your business idea is a 
great investment, you must condense your message down to its essential elements—key points 
that you can communicate in a matter of no more than two minutes. In the Pitch George Elevator 
Competition at George Washington University, students actually make their pitch to judges in
an elevator, where they have the opportunity to make their elevator pitches in just three minutes. 
Winners receive a small cash prize and earn the opportunity to present at the GW Business Plan 
Competition where they compete to earn prizes totaling $101,000.

182
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
The following five-part framework helps entrepreneurs develop a meaningful elevator pitch:
1. Context. What does your company do in easy-to-understand words?
2. Benefit. What benefit or advantage does your company offer customers?
3. Target customers. For whom does your company provide the benefit?
4. Point of differentiation. How is your company different from other companies that 
provide similar products, services, or solutions?
5. Clincher. Can you leave the listener or reader with a memorable, bottom-line sound bite 
about your company.6
Like a good movie trailer, an executive summary is designed to capture readers’ attention and 
draw them into the plan. If it misses, the chances of the remainder of the plan being read are mini-
mal. What is different between an executive summary and a movie trailer is that the executive sum-
mary needs to give away the ending! If it does not, potential funders will never read the full plan.
A coherent, well-developed summary of the full plan establishes a favorable first impression of the 
business and the entrepreneur behind it and can go a long way toward obtaining financing. A good 
executive summary should allow the reader to understand the business concept and how it will make 
money, and it should answer the ultimate question from investors or lenders: “What’s in it for me?” 
Although the executive summary is the first part of the business plan, it should be the last section
written to ensure that it truly captures all of the important points as they appear in the full plan.
MISSION AND VISION STATEMENT A mission statement expresses an entrepreneur’s vision for 
what his or her company is and what it is to become. It is the broadest expression of a company’s
purpose and defines the direction in which it will move. It anchors a company in reality and serves 
as the thesis statement for the entire business plan by answering the question, “What business 
are we in?” Every good plan captures an entrepreneur’s passion and vision for the business, and 
the mission statement is the ideal place to express them. Avoid the use of too much business 
jargon and business clichés. It should clearly state the product or service the business sells, its 
target market, and the basic nature of the business (e.g., manufacturing, consulting, service, 
outsourcing). Mission statements should be limited to no more than 25 words.
DESCRIPTION OF FIRM’S PRODUCT OR SERVICE An entrepreneur should describe the company’s
overall product line, giving an overview of how customers will use its goods or services. Drawings,
diagrams, and illustrations may be required if the product is highly technical. It is best to write product 
and service descriptions so that laypeople can understand them. A statement of a product’s position in 
the product life cycle might also be helpful. An entrepreneur should include a summary of any patents,
trademarks, or copyrights that protect the product or service from infringement by competitors.
One danger entrepreneurs must avoid in this part of the plan is the tendency to dwell on the 
features of their products or services. This problem is the result of the “fall-in-love-with-your-
product” syndrome, which often afflicts inventors. Customers, lenders, and investors care less 
about how much work, genius, and creativity went into a product or service than about what it 
will do for them. This part of the plan builds off the value proposition developed in the business
model. The emphasis of this section should be on defining the benefits customers get by purchas-
ing the company’s products or services, rather than on just a “nuts and bolts” description of the
features of those products or services. A feature is a descriptive fact about a product or service 
(e.g., “an ergonomically designed, more comfortable handle”). A benefit is what the customer 
gains from the product or service feature (e.g., “fewer problems with carpal tunnel syndrome and
increased productivity”). Benefits are at the core of the value proposition of the business model.
This part of the plan must describe how a business will transform tangible product or service 
features into important but often intangible customer benefits—for example, lower energy bills, 
faster access to the Internet, less time writing checks to pay monthly bills, greater flexibility in
building floating structures, shorter time required to learn a foreign language, or others. Remem-
ber: Customers buy benefits, not product or service features.

small business credit industry. He had seen the difficulty small businesses had 
when trying to find financing, and yet he knew that there was financing 
available for many these businesses if they could just get connected to the 
right sources. Although the value of the service was apparent from the be-
ginning, it took Kassar several pivots of his business model to finally offer
small business customers what they wanted, in the way they wanted it.
“There is a fundamental difference between a vision and a business model,”
said Kassar. “While the core model of how we make our money has not
changed from day one, we are constantly testing it, and looking for ways to 
improve it, evolve it, and grow it. Every few months an entrepreneur should 
take a cold shower, and take the time to look in the rear view mirror, and
come up with some new things to try and test.” After getting a profile of a 
small business client and an assessment of its financing needs, Multifunding 
puts together a report that gives the small business owner various financing
options. Multifunding gets paid only when the financing is completed, tak-
ing a small percentage of the approved amount of financing. Multifunding
funded 7 small businesses in its first year and 48 in its second. As part of the 
process of testing and refining its business model, the company began look-
ing into new sources of revenue streams during its third year.7 ■
BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY PROFILE If one goal of creating a plan to raise funding, the entre-
preneur should include a section that acquaints lenders and investors with the industry in which
a company competes. This section should provide readers with an overview of the industry 
or market segment in which the new venture will operate. Industry data such as key trends 
or emerging developments within the industry, market size and its growth or decline, and the 
relative economic and competitive strength of the major firms in the industry set the stage 
for a better understanding of the viability of a new business. Strategic issues such as ease of 
market entry and exit, the ability to achieve economies of scale or scope, and the existence of 
cyclical or seasonal economic trends further help readers to evaluate the new venture. This part 
of the plan also should describe significant industry trends and key success factors as well as an
overall outlook for its future. Information about the evolution of the industry helps the reader 
comprehend its competitive dynamics. The U.S. Industrial Outlook Handbook is an excellent 
k
reference that profiles a variety of industries and offers projections for future trends. Another 
useful resource of industry and economic information is the Summary of Commentary on Current 
Economic Conditions, more commonly known as the Beige Book. Published eight times a year 
by the Federal Reserve, the Beige Book provides detailed statistics and trends in key business
k
sectors and in the overall economy. It offers valuable information on topics ranging from tourism
and housing starts to consumer spending and wage rates. Entrepreneurs can find this wealth of 
information at their fingertips on the Web site of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. This section
should cover all of the relevant information the entrepreneur uncovered during the market and 
industry feasibility analysis.
COMPETITOR ANALYSIS An entrepreneur should describe the new venture’s competition 
and the ways in which the chosen business strategy will position it effectively against key
competitors. Failing to assess competitors realistically makes entrepreneurs appear to be poorly 
prepared, naive, or dishonest, especially to potential lenders and investors. The plan should 
include an analysis of each significant competitor and how well the competing business is 
meeting the important criteria that target customers are currently using to make their purchase 
decisions among the various companies. Entrepreneurs who believe they have no competitors 
are only fooling themselves and are raising a huge red flag to potential lenders and investors. 
Gathering information on competitors’ market shares, products, and strategies is usually not 
difficult. Trade associations, customers, industry journals, marketing representatives, and sales 
literature are valuable sources of data. This section of the plan should focus on demonstrat-
ing that the entrepreneur’s company has an advantage over its competitors and address 
these questions:
● Who are the company’s key competitors?
● What are their strengths and weaknesses?
Ami Kassar, Founder and CEO of Kassar

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
● What are their strategies?
● What images do they have in the marketplace?
● How successful are they?
● What distinguishes the entrepreneur’s product or service from others already on the 
market, and how will these differences produce a competitive edge?
Firsthand competitor research is particularly valuable.
MARKET ENTRY STRATEGY This section addresses the question of how to attract customers. By 
laying out a market entry strategy, an entrepreneur explains how he or she plans to enter the
market and gain a competitive edge and how his or her value proposition sets the business apart 
from the competition. A key component of this section is defining what makes the company 
unique in the eyes of its customers. One of the quickest routes to business failure is trying to
sell “me-too” products or services that offer customers nothing newer, better, bigger, faster, or 
different.
MARKETING STRATEGY One of the most important tasks a business plan must fulfill is proving
that a viable market exists for a company’s goods or services. The business modeling process 
helped to identify and describe a company’s target customers and their characteristics and 
habits. Defining the target audience and its potential is one of the most important—and most 
challenging—parts of the business planning process.
Proving that a profitable market exists involves two steps: showing customer interest and 
documenting market claims. Both of these steps should have been part of the business modeling
process and should be part of the business plan.
Showing Customer Interest An important element of any business plan is showing how a
company’s product or service provides a customer benefit or solves a customer problem.
Entrepreneurs must be able to prove that their target customers actually need or want their goods 
or services and are willing to pay for them. This is why using customers to validate the business
model is so important. Validation from real customers provides the proof of concept that investors
look for in a business plan.
Proving that a viable market exists for a product or service is relatively straightforward for 
a company already in business but can be quite difficult for an entrepreneur with only an idea. In
this case, the key is to find a way to get primary customer data. The feasibility analyses and the 
process of validating the value proposition during the development of the business model pro-
vide this type of real data from real customers. During the development of the business model, 
an entrepreneur might build a prototype and offer it to several potential customers to get written 
testimonials and evaluations to show to investors. The entrepreneur also could sell the product 
to several customers, perhaps at a discount on the condition that they provide evaluations. Doing
so proves that there are potential customers for the product and allows customers to experience 
the product in operation. Getting a product into customers’ hands is also an excellent way to get 
valuable feedback that can lead to significant design improvements and increased sales down the 
road. Integrating this type of primary data into the actual business plan demonstrates that the plan 
has a stronger chance of success.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Matt Cooper and Canoe and Kayak Rental Matt 
Cooper quit his job as an investment banker in New York to start Soggy Bottom Canoe and
Kayak Rental in the backwoods of Mississippi. Cooper was tired of the corporate grind and was
ready for a change of pace. When Cooper arrived in Mississippi, he went full steam ahead buying 
the land, building the facilities, and buying canoes, kayaks, trailers, and vans. He did no market 
research such as talking to any prospective customers before investing in the business. In the seven 
years the business operated, it never reached even half of the revenues it needed to be successful. 
As a result, Cooper used up all of his savings and much of his parents’ savings trying to keep the 
business afloat. In the end, Cooper closed the business and moved to California to take a job in 
Silicon Valley. Cooper attributes his business failure to spending his money on buildings and equip-
ment rather than basic market research and marketing.8 ■

CHAPTER 5 • CRAFTING A BUSINESS PLAN AND BUILDING A SOLID STRATEGIC PLAN
185
Documenting Market Claims Too many business plans rely on vague generalizations such 
as, “This market is so huge that if we get just 1 percent of it, we will break even in eight 
months.” Statements such as these usually reflect nothing more than an entrepreneur’s unbridled
optimism; in most cases, they are quite unrealistic. In The Art of the Start, entrepreneur and 
venture capitalist Guy Kawasaki calls this the Chinese Soda Lie: “If just 1 percent of the
people in China drink our soda, we will be more successful than any company in the history of 
mankind.”9 The problems with this reasoning are (1) few markets, especially the niche markets
that small businesses often pursue, are as large as that, and (2) capturing 1 percent of a big 
market is extremely difficult to do, especially for a small company. Capturing a large share of a 
small, well-defined niche market is much more realistic for a small company than is winning a 
small share of a huge market.
Entrepreneurs must support claims of market size and growth rates with facts, and that re-
quires market research. Results of market surveys, customer questionnaires, and demographic 
studies developed in the feasibility analyses and business modeling steps in the business plan-
ning process lend credibility to an entrepreneur’s frequently optimistic sales projections con-
tained within the formal business plan. (Refer to the market research techniques and resources 
in Chapter 8.) Quantitative market data are important because they form the basis for all of the
company’s financial projections in the business plan. Fortunately, entrepreneurs who follow the 
business planning process will already have this type of data from their feasibility analyses and 
from building and testing their business models.
As you learned in Chapter 4 on conducting a feasibility analysis and business models,
one effective documentation technique involves business prototyping, in which entrepre-
neurs test their business models on a small scale before committing serious resources to a
business that might not work. Business prototyping recognizes that every business idea is a 
hypothesis that should be tested before an entrepreneur takes it to full scale. If the test sup-
ports the hypothesis and its accompanying assumptions, it is time to launch a company. If 
the prototype flops, the entrepreneur scraps the business idea with only minimal losses and
turns to the next idea.
One of the main purposes of the marketing section of the plan is to lay the foundation for 
financial forecasts that follow. Sales, profit, and cash forecasts must be founded on more than 
wishful thinking. An effective market analysis should address the following items in detail based 
on the framework developed in the business model:
Target Market Who are the company’s target customers? How many of them are in the company’s
trading area? What are their characteristics (e.g., age, gender, educational level, income)? What 
do they buy? Why do they buy? When do they buy? What expectations do they have about the 
product or service? Will the business focus on a niche? How does the company seek to position 
itself in the market(s) it will pursue? Knowing my customers’ needs, wants, and habits, what 
should be the basis for differentiating my business in their minds?
Advertising and Promotion Only after entrepreneurs understand their companies’ target markets 
can they design a promotion and advertising campaign to reach those customers most effectively 
and efficiently. When developing an advertising and promotion strategy, an entrepreneur should 
keep in mind what he or she learned when defining the communication channel in the business 
modeling process. Which media are most effective in reaching the target market? How will they 
be used? How much will the promotional campaign cost? How will the promotional campaign 
position the company’s products or services? How can the company benefit from publicity? How 
large is the company’s promotional budget?
Market Size and Trends Assessing the size of the market is a critical step. How large is the 
potential market? Is it growing or shrinking? Why? Are customers’ needs changing? Are sales 
seasonal? Is demand tied to another product or service?

and Eric Friedman cofounded Fitbit as a solution for a problem that Park, like many of the

146 million working adults in the United States, was facing after several years of focusing on his 
work and not himself. Fitbit is a wireless, wearable fitness device that tracks the number of steps 
taken, distance traveled, stairs climbed, and calories burned. Fitbit’s customers lose an average of
13 pounds as a result of becoming 43 percent more active than when they start using the device.
Fitbit sends the data to a dashboard customers access through either the Web or with a mobile 
app. The software provides customers with graphs that show their progress. Fitbit also allows 
customers to connect with each other through social media, where they can compete with each 
other on their progress. By targeting the 25 percent of Americans who are trying to lose weight, 
Fitbit has grown rapidly and now has more than 75 employees.10 ■
Location For many businesses, choosing the right location is a key success factor. For retailers, 
wholesalers, and service companies, the best location usually is one that is most convenient to 
their target customers. Using census data and other market research, entrepreneurs can determine 
the sites with the greatest concentrations of their customers and locate there. Which sites put the 
company in the path of its target customers? Maps that show customer concentrations (available 
from census maps and other sources), traffic counts, the number of customers using a particular 
train station and when, and other similar types of information provide evidence that a solid and 
sizable customer base exists. Do zoning regulations restrict the use of a site? For manufacturers, 
the location issue often centers on finding a site near their key raw materials or near their primary
customers. Using demographic reports and market research to screen potential sites takes the
guesswork out of choosing the “right” location for a business.
Pricing What does the product or service cost to produce or deliver? Before opening a restaurant,
for example, an entrepreneur should know exactly what it will cost to produce each item on
the menu. Failing to know the total cost (including the cost of the food as well as labor, rent, 
advertising, and other indirect costs) of putting a plate in front of a customer is a recipe for failure.
As we will discover in Chapter 10, “Pricing and Credit Strategies,” cost is just one part of the 
pricing equation. Another significant factor to consider is the image a company is trying to create
in the market. Pricing helps communicate and reinforce key elements of the value proposition, 
such as quality and value.
Other pricing issues that a plan should address include: What is the company’s overall pric-
ing strategy? Will the planned price support the company’s strategy and desired image? Given the 
company’s cost structure, will the price produce a profit? How does the planned price compare
to those of similar products or services? Are customers willing to pay it? What price tiers exist 
in the market? How sensitive are customers to price changes? Will the business sell to customers
on credit? Will it accept credit cards? Will the company offer discounts? All of these questions 
help develop the revenue forecasts in the business plan. Remember, revenues are calculated with 
a simple formula: Price × Quantity. Therefore, understanding the proper pricing strategy is half 
the battle of developing accurate revenue forecasts.
Distribution Developed from the distribution channel component of the business model, this 
portion of the plan should describe the specific channels of distribution the business will use (e.g., 
the Internet, direct mail, in-house sales force, sales agents, retailers) to distribute its products 
and services. Will distribution be extensive, selective, or exclusive? What is the average sale?
How large will the sales staff be? How will the company compensate its sales force? What are 
the incentives for salespeople? How many sales calls does it take to close a sale? What can the
company do to make it as easy as possible for customers to buy?
ENTREPRENEURS’ AND MANAGERS’ RÉSUMÉS The most important factor in the success of a 
business venture is its management, and financial officers and investors weight heavily the ability 
and experience of a company’s managers in financing decisions. Investors will never invest in 
just a good idea: There must be a strong team in place to ensure the idea will be implemented 
successfully. A plan should include the résumés of business officers, key directors, and any 
person with at least 20 percent ownership in the company. This is the section of the plan in which 
entrepreneurs have the chance to sell the qualifications and the experience of their management 
team. Remember: Lenders and investors prefer experienced managers. Ideally, they look for 
managers with at least two years of operating experience in the industry they are targeting.

CHAPTER 5 • CRAFTING A BUSINESS PLAN AND BUILDING A SOLID STRATEGIC PLAN
187
In a technology business, investors are looking for partners that have both management and 
technology expertise.
A résumé should summarize each individual’s education, work history (emphasizing man-
agerial responsibilities and duties), and relevant business experience. Lenders and investors 
look for the experience, talent, and integrity of the people who will breathe life into the plan.
This portion of the plan should show that the company has the right people organized in the 
right fashion for success. An entrepreneur can enhance the strength of the management team 
with a capable, qualified board of advisers. A board of directors or advisers consisting of in-
dustry experts lends credibility and can complement the skills of the management team.
PLAN OF OPERATION To complete the description of the business, an entrepreneur should
construct an organization chart identifying the business’s key positions and the people who occupy 
them. Assembling a management team with the right stuff is difficult, but keeping it together until
the company is established can be even harder. Most small companies cannot match the salaries
that employees can earn at larger competitors, but offering stock options, profit-sharing, shares of 
ownership, and other perks helps retain and motivate key employees. A plan of operation should
also describe how the business operates, including space requirements, inventory management if 
applicable, staffing plans, and accounting processes and policies.
Finally, a description of the form of ownership (e.g., sole proprietorship, partnership, joint 
venture, C corporation, S corporation, LLC ) and of any leases, contracts, and other relevant 
agreements pertaining to the operation is helpful.
PRO FORMA (PROJECTED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS One of the most important sections of the 
business plan is an outline of the proposed company’s financial statements—the “dollars and 
cents” of the proposed venture. An entrepreneur should carefully prepare projected (pro forma) 
financial statements for the operation for the next year using past operating data (if available), 
published statistics, and research to derive forecasts of the income statement, balance sheet, cash
forecast (always!), and a schedule of planned capital expenditures. (You will learn more about 
creating projected financial statements in Chapter 11 and cash flow forecasts in Chapter 12.)
Although including only most likely forecasts in the business plan is acceptable, entrepreneurs
also should develop forecasts for pessimistic and optimistic conditions that reflect the uncertainty 
of the future in case potential lenders and investors ask for them.
It is essential that financial forecasts be realistic. Entrepreneurs must avoid the tendency to 
“fudge the numbers” just to make their businesses look good. Experienced lenders and investors
can detect unrealistic forecasts easily. In fact, some venture capitalists automatically discount an 
entrepreneur’s financial projections by as much as 50 percent. One experienced angel investor 
says that when looking at the financial forecasts compiled by an entrepreneur, he always doubles 
the start-up costs and triples the time it will take to launch.
After completing these forecasts, an entrepreneur should perform a break-even analysis for the 
business. The break-even point is critical for an entrepreneurial venture as it signals the point where
the business is able to sustain itself through cash generated by operations and should not need any ad-
ditional start-up capital. It also is the point when the entrepreneur is able to get paid by the business!
It is important to include a statement of the assumptions on which these financial projections 
are based. Potential lenders and investors want to know how an entrepreneur derived forecasts 
for sales, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, accounts receivable, collections, accounts pay-
able, inventory, taxes, and other items. Spelling out realistic assumptions gives a plan more cred-
ibility and reduces the tendency to include overly optimistic estimates of sales growth and profit 
margins. Greg Martin, a partner in the venture capital company Redpoint Ventures, says, “I have 
problems with start-ups making unrealistic assumptions—how much money they need or how 
quickly they can ramp up revenue. Those can really kill a deal for me.”11
In addition to providing valuable information to potential lenders and investors, projected fi-
nancial statements help entrepreneurs run their businesses more effectively and more efficiently 
after start-up. They establish important targets for financial performance and make it easier for an 
entrepreneur to maintain control over routine expenses and capital expenditures. An entrepreneur 
also should  construct a financial dashboard that he or she can use to track the progress of the busi-
ness and assess how well the actual outcomes match the key assumptions made in the business plan.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
THE LOAN OR INVESTMENT PROPOSAL The loan or investment proposal section of the business
plan should state the purpose of the financing, the amount requested, and the plans for repayment 
or, in the case of investors, an attractive exit strategy. When describing the purpose of the loan or 
investment, an entrepreneur must specify the planned use of the funds. Entrepreneurs should state 
the precise amount requested and include relevant backup data, such as vendor estimates of costs
or past production levels. The proposal should include all sources of funding for the business 
from all intended sources including money the entrepreneur is investing into the business. Most 
bankers and investors will want to see evidence that the entrepreneur is willing to “put skin in the 
game” and put some of his or her own money at risk in the venture.
Another important element of the loan or investment proposal is the repayment schedule
or exit strategy. A lender’s main consideration when granting a loan is the reassurance that the 
applicant will repay, whereas an investor’s major concern is earning a satisfactory rate of return.
Financial projections must reflect a company’s ability to repay loans and produce adequate re-
turns. Without this proof, a request for funding stands little chance of being approved. It is neces-
sary for the entrepreneur to produce tangible evidence that shows the ability to repay loans or to 
generate attractive returns. Developing an exit strategy, such as the option to cash out through 
an acquisition or a public offering, is important. Include specific examples of other firms in the
same industry that have already exited to increase the confidence that there is a viable path for 
the investors to exit the business and realize a return on their investments.
Finally, an entrepreneur should include a realistic timetable for implementing the proposed 
plan. This should include a schedule showing the estimated start-up date for the project and not-
ing all significant milestones along the way.
A business plan must present an honest assessment of the risks facing the new venture. Evalu-
ating risk in a business plan requires an entrepreneur to walk a fine line, however. Dwelling too 
much on everything that can go wrong discourages potential lenders and investors from financing 
the venture. Ignoring the project’s risks makes those who evaluate the plan see the entrepreneur as 
naïve, dishonest, or unprepared. The best strategy is to identify the most significant risks the ven-
ture faces and then to describe the plans the entrepreneur has developed to avoid them altogether or 
to overcome the negative outcome if the event does occur. Figure 5.1 explains how two simple dia-
grams communicate effectively to investors both the risks and the rewards of a business venture.
There is a difference between a working business plan (the one the entrepreneur is using 
to guide the business) and the presentation business plan (the one he or she is using to attract 
capital). Although coffee rings and penciled-in changes in a working plan don’t matter (in fact,
they’re a good sign that the entrepreneur is actually using the plan), they have no place on a plan 
going to someone outside the company. A plan is usually the tool an entrepreneur uses to make

Panel B shows investors the range of possible returns and the probability of achieving them. In this example, investors see 
that there is a 15 percent chance of a total loss and an equal chance that they will earn between 15 and 45 percent on their 
investment. There is also a small chance that their initial investment will yield a 200 percent return.

a first impression on potential lenders and investors. To make sure that impression is a favorable 
one, an entrepreneur should follow these tips:
● Realize that first impressions are crucial. Make sure the plan has an attractive (but not an 
expensive) cover.
● Make sure the plan is free of spelling and grammatical errors and typos. It is a professional 
document and should look like one.
● Make it visually appealing. Use color charts, figures, and diagrams to illustrate key points.
Don’t get carried away, however, and end up with a “comic book” plan.
● Include a table of contents with page numbers to allow readers to navigate the plan easily.
Reviewers should be able to look through a plan and quickly locate the sections they want 
to see.
● Make it interesting. Boring plans seldom get read; a good plan tells an interesting story.
● Make the case that the business will make money. Start-ups do not necessarily have to be 
profitable immediately, but sooner or later (preferably sooner), they must make money.
● Use computer spreadsheets to generate a set of realistic financial forecasts. They allow
entrepreneurs to perform valuable “what if” (sensitivity) analysis in just seconds.
● Always include cash flow projections. Entrepreneurs sometimes focus excessively on their 
proposed venture’s profit forecasts and ignore cash flow projections. Although profitabil-
ity is important, lenders and investors are much more interested in cash flow because they 
know that’s where the money to pay them back or to cash them out comes from.
● Keep the plan “crisp,” long enough to say what it should but not so long that it is a chore
to read.
● Tell the truth. Absolute honesty is always critical when preparing a business plan.
Business plans are forecasts about the future that an entrepreneur plans to create, something 
that one expert compares to “taking a picture of the unknown,” which is a challenging feat! As 
uncertain and difficult to predict as the future may be, an entrepreneur who launches a business 
without a plan, arguing that “trying to forecasting the future is pointless,” is misguided. In the 
Harvard Business Review, William Sahlman says, “the best business plans . . . are like movies 
of the future. They show the people, the opportunity, and the context from multiple angles. They 
offer a plausible, coherent story of what lies ahead. They unfold the possibilities of action and 
reaction.”12 That’s the kind of “movie” an entrepreneur should strive to create in a plan.
What Lenders and Investors Look  
for in a Business Plan
To increase their chances of success when using their business plans to attract capital, entrepre-
neurs must be aware of the criteria lenders and investors use to evaluate the creditworthiness of 
businesses seeking financing. Lenders and investors refer to these criteria as the five Cs of credit:
capital, capacity, collateral, character, and conditions.
CAPITAL A small business must have a stable capital base before any lender will grant a loan.
Otherwise the lender would be making, in effect, a capital investment in the business. Most 
lenders refuse to make loans that are capital investments because the potential for return on the 
investment is limited strictly to the interest on the loan, and the potential loss would probably
exceed the reward. In fact, the most common reasons banks give for rejecting small business 
loan applications are undercapitalization or too much debt. Investors also want to make sure 
entrepreneurs have invested enough of their own money into the business to survive the tenuous
start-up period.
CAPACITY A synonym for capacity is cash flow. Lenders and investors must be convinced of a 
company’s ability to meet its regular financial obligations and to repay the bank loan, and that 
LO3

credit” and why they are

takes cash. In Chapter 12, “Managing Cash Flow,” you will see that more small businesses fail 
from lack of cash than from lack of profit. It is possible for a company to be earning a profit and 
still run out of cash. Lenders expect a business to pass the test of liquidity; they study closely a
small company’s cash flow position to decide whether it has the capacity required to succeed. 
Most lenders have become extremely cautious when evaluating cash flow since the financial 
crisis of 2008.
COLLATERAL Collateral includes any assets an entrepreneur pledges to a lender as security
for repayment of the loan. If an entrepreneur defaults on the loan, the bank has the right 
to sell the collateral and use the proceeds to satisfy the loan. Typically, lenders make very 
few unsecured loans (those not backed by collateral) to business start-ups. Bankers view an 
entrepreneur’s willingness to pledge collateral (personal or business assets) as an indication 
of dedication to making the venture a success. Bankers always look first at the personal assets
of the entrepreneur because they represent the easiest way for them to get repaid on a loan if 
the business fails. Entrepreneurs must be ready to sign personal guarantees for all business 
loans, which state that they are personally liable for all bank loans to the business should the 
business fail. Business assets are lenders’ last resort because, selling inventory, equipment, and
buildings owned by the business to repay loans is not an easy or effective means of repayment 
for the bank.
CHARACTER Before putting money into a small business, lenders and investors must be satisfied 
with the owner’s character. An evaluation of character frequently is based on intangible factors 
such as honesty, competence, polish, determination, knowledge, experience, and ability. 
Although the qualities judged are abstract, this evaluation plays a critical role in a lender’s or 
investor’s decision. Banks have also begun to use what potential clients post on social networking 
sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to assess character. If the entrepreneur is closely
tied to successful business people, this can help bolster the bank’s assessment of character. On 
the other hand, posts and links that are unprofessional damage the lender’s impression of the
entrepreneur’s character.
Lenders and investors know that most small businesses fail because of poor management, 
and they try to avoid extending loans to high-risk entrepreneurs. Preparing a solid business plan 
and a polished presentation can go far in convincing potential lenders and investors of an entre-
preneur’s ability to manage a company successfully.
CONDITIONS The conditions surrounding a loan request also affect the owner’s chance of 
receiving funds. Banks consider factors relating to the business operation such as potential growth 
in the market, competition, location, form of ownership, and loan purpose. Again, the owner 
should provide this relevant information in an organized format in the business plan. Another 
important condition influencing the banker’s decision is the shape of the overall economy,
including interest rate levels, the inflation rate, and demand for money. Although these factors 
are beyond an entrepreneur’s control, they still are an important component in a lender’s decision. 
Conditions have not been as favorable for bank loans since the financial crisis in 2008, which has 
made getting business loans more difficult for all small businesses.
The higher a small business scores on these five Cs, the greater its chance will be of receiv-
ing a loan or an investment. Wise entrepreneurs keep this in mind when preparing their business 
plans and presentations.
The Pitch: Making the Business Plan Presentation
Entrepreneurs who are informed and prepared when requesting a loan or investment impress
lenders and investors. When entrepreneurs try to secure funding from lenders or investors, the 
written business plan most often precedes the opportunity to meet face-to-face. In recent years, 
some investors have moved away from requiring the submission of a formal business plan 
and instead based their interest on the entrepreneur’s presentation of the business model. The
written plan must first pass muster before an entrepreneur gets the opportunity to present the plan 
in person. Usually, the time for presenting a business opportunity is short, often no more than just 
a few minutes. (When presenting a plan to a venture capital forum, the allotted time is usually 
LO4

CHAPTER 5 • CRAFTING A BUSINESS PLAN AND BUILDING A SOLID STRATEGIC PLAN
191
less than 20 minutes and rarely more than 30.) When the opportunity arises, an entrepreneur 
must be well prepared. It is important to rehearse, rehearse, and then rehearse some more. It is 
a mistake to begin by leading the audience into a long-winded explanation about the technology 
on which the product or service is based. Within minutes most of the audience will be lost, and 
so is any chance the entrepreneur has of obtaining the necessary financing for the new venture. 
A business plan presentation should cover five basic areas:
● Your company and its products and services. The presentation should answer in simple 
terms the first question that every potential lender and investor has: What does your 
company do?
● The problem to be solved, preferably told in a personal way through a compelling story. Is 
it eliminating the time, expense, and anxiety of waiting for the results of medical tests with 
a device that instantly reads blood samples? Or making hearing aids more effective at 
filtering out background noise while enhancing the dominant sound for the user?
● A description (again in simple terms) of your company’s solution to the problem. Ideally, 
the solution your company has developed is unique and serves as the foundation of your 
company’s competitive edge in the marketplace.
● Your company’s business model. This part of the presentation explains how your company 
makes money and includes figures such as revenue per sale, expected gross profit and net 
profit margins, and other relevant statistics. This is your opportunity to show lenders and
investors how your company will produce an attractive payback or payoff.
● Your company’s competitive edge. Your presentation should identify clearly the factors that 
set your company apart from the competition.
No matter how good a written business plan is, entrepreneurs who stumble through the pre-
sentation will lose the deal. Entrepreneurs who are successful raising the capital their companies 
need to grow have solid business plans and make convincing presentations of them. Some helpful
tips for making a business plan presentation to potential lenders and investors include:
● Prepare. Good presenters invest in preparing their presentations and knowing the points 
they want to get across to their audiences.
● Practice your delivery and then practice some more.
● Demonstrate enthusiasm about the business but don’t be overemotional. Be genuine and be 
yourself.
● Focus on communicating the dynamic opportunity your idea offers and how you plan to 
capitalize on it. Fight the temptation to launch immediately into a lengthy discourse about 
the details of your product or service or how much work it took to develop it. Otherwise, 
you’ll never have the chance to describe the details to lenders and investors.
● Hook investors quickly with an up-front explanation of the new venture, its opportunities, 
and the anticipated benefits to them. For some businesses a story of its impact can be a 
good hook to start a presentation.
● Use visual aids. They make it easier for people to follow your presentation. Don’t make the 
mistake of making the visuals the “star” of the presentation, however. Visual aids should
punctuate your spoken message and focus the audience’s attention on the key points.
● Follow Guy Kawasaki’s 10/20/30 rule for PowerPoint presentations. Use 10 slides that you 
can cover in 20 minutes. Use 30-point font to ensure you do not try to put too many words 
on each slide.13
● Explain how your company’s products or services solve some problem and emphasize the
factors that make your company unique.
● Offer proof. Integrate relevant facts into your presentation to prove your plan’s claims, cus-
tomers’ satisfaction with your company’s products or services, and its profit potential.

192
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
● Hit the highlights. Specific questions will bring out the details later. Don’t get caught up in 
too much detail in early meetings with lenders and investors.
● Keep the presentation “crisp,” just like your business plan. Otherwise, says one experi-
enced investor, “Information that might have caused an investor to bite gets lost in the end-
less drone.”14
● Avoid the use of technical terms that will likely be above most of the audience. Do at least 
one rehearsal before someone who has no special technical training. Tell him or her to stop 
you anytime he or she does not understand what you are talking about. When this occurs 
(and it likely will), rewrite that portion of your presentation.
● Remember that every potential lender and investor you talk to is thinking “What’s in it for 
me?” Be sure to answer that question in your presentation.
● Close by reinforcing the potential of the opportunity. Be sure you have sold the benefits the 
investors will realize when the business succeeds.
● Be prepared for questions. In many cases, there is seldom time for a long “Q&A” session,
but interested investors may want to get you aside to discuss the details of the plan.
● Anticipate the questions the audience is most likely to ask and prepare for them in advance.
● Be sensitive to the issues that are most important to lenders and investors by reading the 
pattern of their questions. Focus your answers accordingly. For instance, some investors
may be interested in the quality of the management team whereas others are more inter-
ested in marketing strategies. Be prepared to offer details on either.
● Follow up with every investor to whom you make a presentation. Don’t sit back and wait; 
be proactive. They have what you need—investment capital. Demonstrate that you have 
confidence in your plan and have the initiative necessary to run a business successfully.
The Richards Barrentine Values and Ventures® Business Plan Com-
petition, run by the Neeley Entrepreneurship Center at Texas
Christian University, focuses on for-profit enterprises owned by
current undergraduate students that specifically impact society in 
meaningful ways. Plans must demonstrate a societal or environ-
mental need to be filled, such as contributions to sustainability,
innovations in the health and life sciences, innovations in energy,
or opportunities for underrepresented groups in business. Business
plans submitted for the Values and Ventures competition must be
for-profit values-centered enterprises. The competition defines a 
values-centered enterprise as one that assures sustainable pros-
perity while also supporting the needs of company owners and 
shareholders, employees and their families, suppliers, customers, 
communities, and the environment. This is not a competition for 
nonprofit social enterprises.
Values and Ventures is a two-day event. During the first day, 
teams present in concurrent sessions. The teams are grouped into
flights. The first place team in each flight automatically advances 
to the finals. The second place teams in each flight compete in a
“lightning round.” The top two teams from the lightening round
also make the finals. In the second day of competition, each 
finalist presents again to the judges. Each team gets 12 minutes to
present and 10 minutes to respond to questions from the judges.

Building a Strategic Plan
The rules of the competitive game are constantly changing. To be successful, entrepreneurs must 
adapt to changes in the marketplace. Fortunately, entrepreneurs have at their disposal a power-
ful weapon to cope with an often hostile, ever-changing environment: the process of strategic 
planning. Strategic planning involves developing a game plan to guide a company as it strives
to accomplish its vision, mission, goals, and objectives and to keep it from straying off course.
A solid strategic plan provides managers and employees a sense of direction when everyone 
is involved in creating and updating it. As more team members become committed to making 
the plan work, it takes on special meaning. It gives everyone targets to shoot for, and it provides 
a yardstick for measuring actual performance against those targets, especially in the crucial and 
chaotic start-up phase of the business.
Clate Mask, cofounder and CEO of Infusionsoft, credits strategic planning for the successful 
growth of his company from a small start-up to a 450-employee company funded with venture 
capital. Infusionsoft’s strategic planning is built from a bold three- to five-year vision of what 
the business can become and what it can achieve. From there, the company develops three to five 
annual priorities that ensure progress toward the vision. Finally, managers develop the quarterly 
priorities and operational tactics necessary to reach their annual goals. “Strategic planning isn’t 
a one-time event,” says Mask. “Once you’ve laid out your strategy, it’s crucial to stay focused 
over the long-term. I’ve found that it’s vital to schedule a steady rhythm of productive meetings—
annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily.”15

The third place team, winner of $5,000, was Sneeze4 from Texas 
Christian University. The venture sells tissues that support issues di-
rected by the consumer. The second place team, winner of $10,000,
was SoundSense from Christopher Newport University. SoundSense
offers a home communication system for the hearing impaired. The 
first place team, winner of $15,000, was Crowdvance from George
Washington University, founded by Dylan Fox, a self-taught Web site 
designer. Fox came up with the idea for Crowdvance while working 
on his design software and was able to attract a couple of fraternity 
brothers to help him launch the company.
Crowdvance supports small community groups, such as a 
Little League team struggling to pay for its uniforms or a high school
debate team that needs money to enter a national competition. 
Donors to Crowdvance get a menu of exclusive deals, such as 
discounts on tickets or various products from national companies 
such as Hulu and Fathead. Crowdvance gets its revenues from its
donors buying products through its Web site. Crowdvance charges
no fee against the actual donation, which differentiates the com-
pany from its competitors, which charge a 3 to 10 percent fee. The 
small community groups get 100 percent of the donated funds.
After graduation, Fox began working full-time on Crowd-
vance. The company raised a seed round of financing.

Perhaps the biggest change that entrepreneurs face is unfolding now: the shift in the world’s 
economy from a base of financial to intellectual capital. “Knowledge is no longer just a factor of 
l
production,” says futurist Alvin Toffler. “It is the critical factor of production.”
l
17 Today, a compa-
ny’s intellectual capital is likely to be the source of its competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Intellectual capital is comprised of three components:18
1. Human capital consists of the talents, creativity, skills, and abilities of a company’s work
l
-
force and shows up in the innovative strategies, plans, and processes the people in an orga-
nization develop and then passionately pursue.
2. Structural capital is the accumulated knowledge and experience that a company possesses.
l
It can take many forms, including processes, software, patents, copyrights, and, perhaps 
most important, the knowledge and experience of the people in a company.
3. Customer capital is the established customer base, positive reputation, ongoing relation
l
-
ships, and goodwill that a company builds up over time with its customers.
Increasingly, entrepreneurs are recognizing that the capital stored in these three areas forms the 
foundation of their ability to compete effectively and that they must manage this intangible capi-
tal base carefully. Every business uses all three components in its strategy, but the emphasis on
each one varies from company to company.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington and Valve Corpo-
ration Valve Corporation, based in Bellevue, Washington, is a video game development 
and digital distribution company. Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington founded Valve in 1996, after 
leaving their positions at Microsoft. Valve’s first video game success was Half-Life, which it re-
leased in 1998. Valve’s 300 employees work in an organization that has no bosses and no formal 
managers. Any employee has the power to approve a new project and hire new employees. All 
desks are on wheels, allowing employees to move around freely and join any project that interests 
them. Valve CEO Gabe Newell, to whom nobody in the company officially reports, says the struc-
ture makes sense for what they produce. He says managers are good at creating procedures and
processes. Because Valve must continuously create new games that have never existed, Newell
believes managers would get in the way of employees’ creativity.19 ■
This knowledge shift is creating as much change in the world’s business systems as the 
Industrial Revolution did in the agriculture-based economies of the 1800s. The Knowledge 
Revolution threatens the existence of those companies that are not prepared for it, but it is
spawning tremendous opportunities for those entrepreneurs who are equipped with the strate-
gies to exploit these opportunities. Management legend Jack Welch, who masterfully guided 
General Electric for many years, says, “Intellectual capital is what it’s all about. Releasing 
the ideas of people is what we’ve got to do if we are going to win.”20 However, in practice, 
releasing people’s ideas is much more difficult than it appears. The key is to encourage em-
ployees to generate a large volume of ideas, recognizing that only a few (the best) will survive. 
According to Gary Hamel, author of Inside the Revolution, “If you want to find a few ideas 
with the power to enthrall customers, foil competitors, and thrill investors, you must first 
generate hundreds and potentially thousands of unconventional strategic ideas. Put simply, 
you have to crush a lot of rock to find a diamond.”21 In other words, small companies must 
use the creativity-stimulating techniques discussed in Chapter 3 as one source of competitive
advantage over their rivals.

CHAPTER 5 • CRAFTING A BUSINESS PLAN AND BUILDING A SOLID STRATEGIC PLAN
195
Building a Competitive Advantage
The goal of developing a strategic plan is to create for the small company a competitive 
advantage—the value proposition that sets a small business apart from its competitors and gives
it a unique position in the market that is superior to its rivals. It is the differentiating factor that 
makes customers want to buy from your business rather than from your competitors. From a stra-
tegic perspective, the key to business success is to develop a sustainable competitive advantage, 
one that is durable, creates value for customers, and is difficult for competitors to duplicate. For 
example, Whole Foods competes successfully with giant chains such as Wal-Mart and Kroger not 
on price but by emphasizing superior customer service, higher-quality products, a more extensive 
inventory of local and organic products, and a commitment to fair-trade suppliers. Its stores are
well organized, attractive, and entertaining. Asked to describe his recently opened Whole Foods 
store, team leader Matthew Mell says, “It’s a Disney World for foodies.”22 Companies that fail
to define their competitive advantage fall into “me-too” strategies that never set them apart 
from their competitors and do not allow them to become market leaders or to achieve above-
average profits.
Entrepreneurs should examine five aspects of their businesses to define their companies’ 
competitive advantages:
1. Products they sell. What is unique about the products the company sells? Do they save 
customers time or money? Are they more reliable and more dependable than those that 
competitors sell? Do they save energy, protect the environment, or provide more
convenience for customers? By identifying the unique customer benefits of their compa-
nies’ products, entrepreneurs can differentiate their businesses. Jason Lucash and Mike 
Szymczak developed their first audio speakers to solve their own problem. They wanted 
to develop speakers that would be easy to take along on trips. Their solution was speak-
ers made of recycled cardboard that come flat and open up like an origami paper model. 
OrigAudio cardboard speakers caught on quickly with customers looking for inexpensive 
speakers with an edgy design. OrigAudio added eight more products to its line of audio 
speakers, including custom printed headphones that let customers choose their own 
unique designs. OrigAudio headphones sell for one-fifth the price of most major brands. 
“It’s hard to be in a huge sector,” says Lucash. “But if we stick to what we are good at, we
will be successful.”23
2. Service they provide. Many entrepreneurs find that the service they provide their customers 
is an excellent way to differentiate their companies. Because they are small, friendly, and 
close to their customers, small businesses can provide customer service that is superior to 
that which their larger competitors can provide. What services does the company provide 
(or which ones can it provide) to deliver added value and a superior shopping experience 
for customers?
3. Pricing they offer. As we will see later in this chapter, some small businesses differentiate 
themselves using price. Price can be a powerful point of differentiation; offering the low-
est price gives some customers a great incentive to buy. However, offering the lowest price 
is not always the best way to create a unique image. Small companies that do not offer the 
lowest prices must emphasize the value their products offer.
4. Way they sell. Customers today expect to be able to conduct business when they want to, 
meaning that companies that offer extended hours—even 24-hour service seven days a 
week (perhaps via the Internet)—have the basis for an important competitive advantage. 
Zoots, a small chain of dry-cleaning stores in the Northeast, offers customers extended 
hours seven days a week and allows a secure 24-hour pickup and drop-off service. The 
company also offers a home pickup and delivery service that customers can book online 
and an environmentally friendly cleaning process, all of which maximize customers’ 
convenience and set the company apart from its competition.24
5. Values to which they are committed. The most successful companies exist for reasons
that involve far more than merely making money. The entrepreneurs behind these com-
panies understand that one way to connect with customers and establish a competitive

edge is to manage their companies from a values-based perspective and operate them 
in an ethical and socially responsible fashion. In other words, they recognize that there 
is no inherent conflict between earning a profit and creating good for society and the
environment.
Building a competitive advantage alone is not enough; the key to success over time is
building a sustainable competitive advantage. In the long run, a company gains a sustainable 
competitive advantage through its ability to develop a set of core competencies that enable it 
to serve its selected target customers better than its rivals. Core competencies are a unique 
set of capabilities that a company develops in key areas, such as superior quality, customer 
service, innovation, team building, flexibility, and responsiveness, that allow it to vault past 
competitors. As the phrase suggests, they are central to a company’s ability to compete suc-
cessfully and are usually the result of important skills and lessons that a business has learned 
over time.
Typically, a company develops core competencies in no more than five or six (often fewer)
areas. These core competencies become the nucleus of a company’s competitive advantage and 
are usually quite enduring over time. Markets, customers, and competitors may change, but a 
company’s core competencies are more durable, forming the building blocks for everything a
company does. To be effective strategically, these competencies should be difficult for com-
petitors to duplicate, and they must provide customers with an important perceived benefit. 
Small companies’ core competencies often have to do with the advantages of their size, such as 
agility, speed, closeness to their customers, superior service, or the ability to innovate. Smart 
entrepreneurs use their companies’ size to their advantage, recognizing that it allows them to 
do things that their larger rivals cannot. The key to success is building the company’s strat-
egy on its core competencies and concentrating them on providing value for target customers 
(see Figure 5.2).
Successful small companies are able to build strategies that exploit all the competitive 
advantages that their size gives them by doing the following:
● Responding quickly to customers’ needs
● Providing the precise desired level of customer service
● Remaining flexible and willing to change
● Constantly searching for new, emerging market segments
● Building and defending small market niches
● Erecting “switching costs,” the costs a customer incurs by switching to a competitor’s
product or service, through personal service and loyalty
● Remaining entrepreneurial and willing to take risks and act with lightning speed
● Constantly innovating

its first store in 1996. The company has achieved this growth even after moving away from a fran-
chising model, which is the most common strategic approach for growing restaurant chains. Kevin 
Reddy, Chairman and CEO of Noodles & Company, says the company may start selling franchises 
again at some point in the future, but its strategy is to build a solid base by staying close to cus-
tomers and offering a simple menu built on noodles and pasta. Although the company has faced
some pressure to grow more quickly since its IPO in 2013, managers are holding firm to their long-
term strategic focus. The company continues to use feedback from its customers to adapt its busi-
ness model and strategies. The company views its core competency as operational excellence used 
to build a strong brand. By owning most of the stores, Reddy says, the company focuses on grow-
ing its customers rather than adding a certain number of franchises. He says it also offers more 
opportunity for employees to grow and develop within the company, which creates a stronger 
team.25 ■
No business can (or should) be everything to everyone. In fact, one of the biggest pitfalls 
many entrepreneurs stumble into is failing to differentiate their companies from the crowd of 
competitors. Entrepreneurs often face the challenge of setting their companies apart from their 
larger, more powerful competitors (who can easily outspend them) by using their creativity and 
the special abilities their businesses offer customers. Developing core competencies does not
necessarily require a company to spend a great deal of money. It does, however, require an entre-
preneur to use creativity, imagination, and vision to identify those things that it does best and that 
are most important to its target customers. Businesses have an infinite number of ways to create a 
competitive edge, but building a strategy around a company’s core competencies allows it to gain 
a sustainable competitive advantage based on what it does best.
Strategic management enhances a small company’s effectiveness, but entrepreneurs first 
must have a process designed to meet their needs and their business’s special characteristics. 
It is a mistake to attempt to apply a big business’s strategic development techniques to a small
business because a small business is not merely “a little big business.” Because of their size and 
their particular characteristics—small resource base, flexible managerial style, informal organi-
zational structure, and adaptability to change—small businesses need a different approach to the 
strategic management process. The strategic management procedure for a small business should
include the following features:
● Use a relatively short planning horizon—two years or less for most small companies.
● Be informal and not overly structured; a shirtsleeve approach is ideal.
● Encourage the participation of employees and outside parties to improve the reliability and 
creativity of the resulting plan.
● Do not begin with setting objectives because extensive objective setting early on may inter-
fere with the creative process of strategic management.
● Maintain flexibility; competitive conditions change too rapidly for any plan to be consid-
ered permanent.
● Focus on strategic thinking, not just planning, by linking long-range goals to day-to-day 
operations.
● Be an ongoing process because businesses and the competitive environment in which they 
operate constantly change.
The Strategic Management Process
Strategic management is a continuous process that consists of nine steps:
Step 1. Develop a clear vision and translate it into a meaningful mission statement.
Step 2. Assess the company’s strengths and weaknesses.
Step 3. Scan the environment for significant opportunities and threats facing the business.
Step 4. Identify the key factors for success in the business.

Step 1. Develop a Clear Vision and Translate It  
into a Meaningful Mission Statement
VISION Throughout history, the greatest political and business leaders have been visionaries. 
Whether the vision is as grand as Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have a dream” speech or as simple as 
Ray Kroc’s devotion to quality, service, cleanliness, and value at McDonald’s, the purpose is the 
same: to focus everyone’s attention on the same target and to inspire them to reach it. The vision 
is future oriented and touches everyone associated with the company—its employees, investors, 
lenders, customers, and the community. It is an expression of what an entrepreneur stands for 
and believes in. Highly successful entrepreneurs communicate their vision and their enthusiasm 
about that vision to those around them.
A vision is the result of an entrepreneur’s dream of something successful that does not exist 
yet and the ability to paint a compelling picture of that dream for everyone to see. It answers the 
question, “Where are we going?” Former NFL player Nick Buoniconti started the Miami Project 
to Cure Paralysis with a vision to “cure spinal cord injury” after his son, Mark, was paralyzed 
by a football injury. This was considered an audacious goal at that time because spinal cord in-
juries were considered permanent and incurable. Buoniconti created a bold vision to help bring 
together supporters and researchers to move toward real progress in spinal cord treatment. Since 
its founding, the Miami Project has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for research that has 
led to critical breakthroughs in treating spinal cord injuries.26 A strong vision helps a company
in four ways:
1. Vision provides direction. Entrepreneurs who spell out the vision for their company focus 
everyone’s attention on the future and determine the path the business will take to get there.
2. Vision determines decisions. The vision influences the decisions, no matter how big or 
how small, that owners, managers, and employees make every day in a business. This
influence can be positive or negative, depending on how well defined the vision is.
3. Vision inspires people. A clear vision excites and ignites people to action. People want to 
work for a company that sets its sights high.
4. Vision allows for perseverance in the face of adversity. Young companies, their found-
ers, and their employees often face many hardships from a multitude of sources. Having 
a vision that serves as a company’s “guiding star” enables people to overcome imposing 
obstacles.
Vision is based on an entrepreneur’s values. Explaining how an entrepreneur’s values are the 
nucleus around which a company grows, author and consultant Ken Blanchard says, “Winning 
companies first emphasize values—the beliefs that you, as the business owner, have about your 
employees, customers, quality, ethics, integrity, social responsibility, growth, stability, innova-
tion, and flexibility. Managing by values—not by profits—is a powerful process.”27 Successful
entrepreneurs build their businesses around a set of three to seven core values that might range 
from respect for the individual and innovation to creating satisfied customers and making the 
world a better place. Indeed, truly visionary entrepreneurs see their companies’ primary purpose
as more than just “making money.”
Business writer Thomas Stewart explains that works in small businesses don’t just fill
out forms and do menial work; they are also making important decisions. The entrepreneur 
must ensure that the workers’ decisions are aligned with the company’s strategic compass. 
The extent of that alignment depends on the entrepreneur’s values and how well he or she

TABLE 5.1 Creating a Vision for Your Company
Ari Wienzweig, founder of Zingerman’s Community of Businesses, emphasizes the importance of 
creating a vision to achieve entrepreneurial success. A vision is a picture of what success will look like 
in a business at a particular time in the future. “The power that comes out of visioning is huge,” he says. 
“Effective visioning allows us to move toward the future we want, not just react to a present-day reality 
we don’t like.”
How does an entrepreneur start the visioning process? First, select the time frame, ideally 
3 to 10 years out. The next step is to write the first draft of your vision, remembering to shoot for 
something great, even those things that other people have told you repeatedly were unachievable. 
As you proceed, write as if your vision already has happened. The following questions will help you 
get started:
1. How big is your business?
2. What has your business achieved that you are most proud of?
a. Relative rank in your industry
b. Financial success
c. Product or service quality
d. Contribution to the community
e. Awards and recognitions
3. What are your most important product lines or services?
4. What products or services do you refuse to offer?
5. What is a customer’s shopping experience like at your business? What makes that experience 
different from your competition?
6. Who are your customers? How did you find them?
7. If you asked your customers to list the three most noteworthy characteristics of your business, 
what would they be?
8. How do you describe your management style?
9. What kind of people do you hire as employees and managers?
10. What kind of relationship do you have with your employees? What do they say about their jobs?
11. What do you do every day when you go to work? How many hours a week do you work?
12. How does the community view your business?
13. What do suppliers say about your business?
14. What do industry experts say about your business?
You will probably write several drafts of your vision before sharing it with others, especially with 
the people who will be involved in making it a reality. Ask for their feedback and input, but remember: 
It’s your vision. When people ask (and they inevitably will) “How will we achieve that?” remember 
r
that vision is about the “what”; strategy—the “how”—comes later.

transmits them throughout the company.* Table 5.1 offers useful tips for creating a vision for 
your company.
The best way to put values into action is to create a written mission statement that commu-
nicates those values to everyone the company touches.
MISSION The mission statement addresses another basic question of any business venture:
“What business are we in?” Establishing the purpose of the business in writing must come first 
in order to give the company a sense of direction. “As an entrepreneur, your company’s mission 
statement should be concise and specific so your customers understand your purpose and how 
you provide value to them,” says serial entrepreneur Patrick Hull.28 As an enduring declaration of 
a company’s purpose, a mission statement is the mechanism for making it clear to everyone the 
company touches “why we are here” and “where we are going.”

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Without a concise, meaningful mission statement, a small business risks wandering aim-
lessly in the marketplace, with no idea of where to go or how to get there. A great mission state-
ment sets the tone for the entire company and focuses its attention in the right direction.
Elements of a Mission Statement A sound mission statement need not be lengthy to be effective.
In fact, shorter usually is better. The four key questions entrepreneurs and their employees should 
address as they develop a mission statement for their businesses are the following:
● What are we in business to accomplish?
● Who are we in business to serve?
● How are we going to accomplish that purpose?
● What principles and beliefs form the foundation of the way we do business?
A company’s mission statement may be the most essential and basic communication that 
it puts forward. It should inspire and motivate employees by communicating the company’s 
overarching values. If the people on the plant, shop, retail, or warehouse floor don’t know what 
a company’s mission is, then, for all practical purposes, it does not have one! The mission state-
ment expresses a company’s character, identity, and scope of operations, but writing it is only 
half the battle, at best. The most difficult and important part is living that mission every day.
That’s how employees decide what really matters. To be effective, a mission statement must 
become a natural part of the organization, embodied in the minds, habits, attitudes, and decisions 
of everyone in the company every day. In other words, a good mission statement is translated 
into positive performance within an organization. Five years after founding Field Trip Factory 
Inc., a business that organizes life skill educational field trips for students, Susan Singer saw the 
need to update the company’s mission statement. At a company retreat, she and her employees 
decided that their existing mission statement no longer reflected what the company actually 
stood for and did. A brainstorming session yielded a new mission statement that Singer says is
helping her company improve its bottom line. “It became so clear what we do vs. what we want 
to be,” she says.29
A well-used mission statement serves as a strategic compass for a small company, guiding 
both managers and employees as they make decisions in the face of uncertainty. Some companies 
use short, one- or two-sentence mission statements that are easy to remember and understand,
and others create longer mission statements with multiple components. Consider the following 
examples:
● Bongo World is the parent company of five coffee shops in Nashville, Tennessee all 
committed to serving organic, fair-trade coffee. Bongo World’s mission: “Bongo World 
supports communities by expanding the definition of quality to include how stuff is 
produced, purchased and served.”30
● Badger Mining Corporation, Berlin, Wisconsin: “We will be the leader in the industrial 
sand industry with a team of associates committed to excellence and a passion for 
satisfying our stakeholders.”31
● Putney, Inc., located in Portland, Maine, manufactures generic prescription drugs for pets. 
Its mission is to “partner with veterinary practices to provide high-quality medicines that 
meet pet medical needs and offer cost-effective medicines for pet owners.”32
● Nisolo Shoes is a social enterprise that supports artisans in developing countries by creat-
ing distribution and branding for their products. Co-founder Patrick Woodyard says its 
mission is as follows: “Nisolo is a socially conscious brand dedicated to offering a unique 
product that fuses quality and fashion with a vision to spur sustainable development 
throughout impoverished regions of the world.”33
● The Clymb is a retailer of outdoor gear and apparel located in Portland, Oregon. “Our 
mission is to increase the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants by inspiring human-
powered adventure.”34
A company may have a powerful competitive advantage, but it is wasted unless (1) the 
owner has communicated that advantage to workers, who, in turn, work hard to communicate it

to customers and potential customers and (2) customers recommend the company to their friends 
because they understand the benefits they are getting from it that they cannot get elsewhere. 
That’s the real power of a mission statement. Table 5.2 offers some useful tips on writing a 
mission statement.
TABLE 5.2 Tips for Writing a Powerful Mission Statement
A mission statement is a useful tool for getting everyone fired up and heading in the same direction, 
but writing one is not as easy as it may first appear. Here are some tips for writing a powerful mission 
statement:
● 
Keep it short. The best mission statements are just a few sentences long. If they are short, people 
tend to remember them better.
● 
Keep it simple. Avoid using fancy jargon just to impress outsiders such as customers or suppliers.
The first and most important use of a mission statement is inside a company.
● 
Know what makes your company different. Your competitors are trying to reach the same 
customers that you are. A mission statement should address what is unique about your company and 
what sets it apart from the competition.
● 
Take a broad view, but not too broad. If it is too specific, a mission statement can limit a company’s 
potential. Similarly, a mission statement is too broad if it applies to any company in the industry. 
When asked what business his company was in, Rob Carter, a top manager at FedEx, did not mention 
shipping packages quickly; instead, his response was, “We’re in the business of engineering time.”
● 
Get everyone involved. If the boss writes the company mission statement, who is going to criticize 
it? Although the entrepreneur has to be the driving force behind the mission statement, everyone 
in the company needs the opportunity to have a voice in creating it. Expect to write several drafts 
before you arrive at a finished product.
● 
Keep it current. Mission statements can get stale over time. As business and competitive conditions
change, so should your mission statement. Make a habit of evaluating your mission periodically so
that it stays fresh.
● 
Make sure your mission statement reflects the values and beliefs you hold dear. They are the 
foundation on which your company is built.
● 
Make sure your mission includes values that are worthy of your employees’ best efforts. One
entrepreneur says a mission statement should “send a message to employees, suppliers, and 
customers as to what the purpose of the company is aside from just making profits.”
● 
Make sure your statement reflects a concern for the future. Business owners can get so focused 
on the present that they forget about the future. A mission statement should be the first link to the 
company’s future.
● 
Keep the tone of the statement positive and upbeat. No one wants to work for a business with a 
pessimistic outlook of the world.
● 
Use your mission statement to lay an ethical foundation for your company. This is the ideal time 
to let employees know what your company stands for—and what it won’t stand for.
● 
Look at other companies’ mission statements to generate ideas for your own. Two books, Say It 
and Live It: The 50 Corporate Mission Statements That Hit the Mark (Currency/Doubleday) and
k
Mission Statements: A Guide to the Corporate and Nonprofit Sectors (Garland Publishing), are 
useful resources. Internet searches also produce useful examples of mission statements.
● 
Make sure your mission statement is appropriate for your company’s culture. Although you 
should look at other companies’ missions, do not make the mistake of trying to copy them. Your 
company’s mission is unique to you and your company.
● 
Revise it when necessary. No business is static, which means that your company’s mission statement 
should change as your company changes. Work with a team of employees on a regular basis to 
review and revise your company’s mission statement.
● 
Use it. Don’t go to all of the trouble of writing a mission statement just to let it collect dust. Post it 
on bulletin boards, print it on buttons and business cards, stuff it into employees’ pay envelopes. Talk 
about your mission often, and use it to develop your company’s strategic plan. That’s what it’s for!

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Step 2. Assess the Company’s Strengths and Weaknesses
Having defined the vision they have for their company and translated that vision into a mean-
ingful mission statement, entrepreneurs can turn their attention to assessing company strengths
and weaknesses. Building a successful competitive strategy requires a business to magnify its 
strengths and overcome or compensate for its weaknesses. Strengths are positive internal factors 
that a company can draw on to accomplish its mission, goals, and objectives. They might include
special skills or knowledge, a superior proprietary product or process, a positive public image, 
an experienced sales force, an established base of loyal customers, and many other factors. For 
instance, 1366 Technologies, a company in Lexington, Massachusetts, has developed a revolu-
tionary process called the Direct Wafer method for producing the silicon wafers inside most solar 
panels. The process represents a major strength for the small company because it reduces wafer 
manufacturing costs 60 percent and reduces the time required to make a wafer from more than
two days to just seconds.35 Weaknesses are negative internal factors that inhibit a company’s 
ability to accomplish its mission, goals, and objectives. Lack of capital, a shortage of skilled 
workers, the inability to master technology, and an inferior location are examples of weaknesses.
Identifying strengths and weaknesses helps owners understand their businesses as they exist 
(or that, for start-ups, will exist). An organization’s strengths should originate in the core com-
petencies that are essential to gaining an edge in each of the market segments in which the firm
competes. The key to building a successful strategy is using the company’s underlying strengths
as its foundation and matching those strengths against competitors’ weaknesses.
One technique for taking this strategic inventory is to prepare a “balance sheet” of the com-
pany’s strengths and weaknesses (see Table 5.3). The left side should reflect important skills, 
knowledge, or resources that contribute to the firm’s success. The right side should record hon-
estly any limitations that detract from the company’s ability to compete. This balance sheet 
should analyze all key performance areas of the business—human resources, finance, production,
marketing, product development, organization, and others. This analysis should give owners a 
realistic perspective of their businesses, pointing out foundations on which they can build future 
strengths and obstacles that they must remove for the business to progress. This exercise can help 
entrepreneurs determine the best way to move from their current position to a desired one.
Step 3. Scan the Environment for Significant Opportunities  
and Threats Facing the Business
OPPORTUNITIES Once entrepreneurs have taken an internal inventory of company strengths and 
weaknesses, they must turn to the external environment to identify any opportunities and threats that 
might have a significant impact on the business.Opportunities are positive external options that a firm 
can exploit to accomplish its mission, goals, and objectives. The number of potential opportunities is 
limitless; therefore, entrepreneurs should analyze only those that are most significant to the business
(probably two or three at most). The key is to focus on the most promising opportunities that fit most 
closely with the company’s strengths and core competencies. That requires entrepreneurs to say 
“no” to opportunities, even promising ones, that do not fit their companies’ strategic vision.

When identifying opportunities, an entrepreneur must pay close attention to new potential 
markets and product offerings. Are competitors overlooking a niche in the market we could easily 
exploit? Is there a better way to reach our customers, such as a greater focus on online sales? Are 
there new markets we can expand into with our existing business? Can we develop new products
that offer customers better value? What opportunities are trends in the industry creating?
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: World Wrestling Entertainment The rapid growth in
online streaming of video content led World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to shift away 
from relying on cable television distribution of its shows to launching its own 24/7 online 
streaming network. WWE Network airs all of the WWE live pay-per-view events, original program-
ming, reality shows, documentaries, classic matches from its archives, and more than 1,500 hours of 
video on demand. Customers pay a flat monthly subscription fee to gain access to all WWE network 
content through its Web site and through apps that are compatible with most tablets and smart 
phones. Viewership of pay-per-view over cable and satellite television has been declining, while online 
streaming has continued to grow as a new medium for video content. WWE believes that the new 
business model provides an opportunity to generate more predictable and growing revenues.36 ■
As WWE Network’s experience illustrates, opportunities arise as a result of factors that are be-
yond entrepreneurs’ control. Constantly scanning for those opportunities that best match their compa-
nies’ strengths and core competences and pouncing on them ahead of competitors is the key to success.
Threats are negative external forces that inhibit a company’s ability to achieve its mission, 
goals, and objectives. Threats to the business can take a variety of forms, such as new com-
petitors entering the local market, a government mandate regulating a business activity, an eco-
nomic recession, rising interest rates, mounting energy prices, or technology advances making 
a company’s product obsolete. For instance, the growing reach of cellular phone networks and 
advances in smart phone technology pose a threat to companies that provide traditional landline 
It’s the news that sends shivers down the spines of small business
owners everywhere: Wal-Mart (or any other “big-box” retailer) is com-
ing to town. “How can my small business compete against the largest
retailer in the world?” they wonder. “Can my business survive?”
Although no business owner welcomes a threat of this mag-
nitude from a giant competitor with greater buying power, more 
name recognition, and a reputation for driving small companies 
out of business, it is no reason to fold up the tent and go home.
Smart entrepreneurs know that, by formulating and executing the 
proper strategy, they can not only survive in the face of larger 
competitors but also thrive in their presence.
Rule 1. Don’t Play Their Game
A fundamental concept in strategy is to avoid matching your com-
pany’s weaknesses against a competitor’s strengths. For instance, 
because Wal-Mart buys in such huge volume from its suppliers, it 
can extract the lowest prices from them. Small companies purchas-
ing from those same suppliers cannot; therefore, it makes little sense
for small companies to try to compete with Wal-Mart and other
giant retailers on price. Unless your small company has another more
significant cost advantage, competing on the basis of price is a rec-
ipe for disaster. Entrepreneurs who compete successfully emphasize
features that giant discounters cannot provide—extensive product 
knowledge, better selection, superior customer service, a hassle-
free buying experience, higher quality, and others. “Not everyone 
wants the lowest quality at the lowest price,” says one expert.
Rule 2. Emphasize the Unique Aspects of Your 
Company and How They Benefit Your Customers
Joe Runyan, founder of Hangers Cleaners of Kansas City, 
Missouri, was faced with the challenge of competing with Proctor &
Gamble’s entry into the dry cleaning market with its national 
rollout of Tide Dry Cleaners. Hangers Cleaners had been able to
differentiate its service by offering an environmentally safe dry 
cleaning process. Hangers Cleaners uses liquid carbon dioxide in-
stead of the harsh chemicals traditionally used by dry cleaners. 
However, Tide Dry Cleaning also offered eco-friendly dry cleaning 
services. To compete with a large national brand, Runyan pursued 
several strategies. Hangers focused on its offbeat image. The com-
pany sent out entertaining promotional e-mails, gave away T-shirts
bearing the invitation to “Sniff Me,” put funny messages on its 
hangers, and held a St. Patrick’s Day tailgate party in the parking
lot. The company also pays close attention to customer service. 
Hangers has several programs to help with fundraising for local 
nonprofits and schools. The company offers van service for pick-up 
and delivery to affluent neighborhoods willing to pay a premium

for the extra service. Although many of the other local dry clean-
ers suffered after the entry of Tide Dry Cleaners, Runyan’s business 
has continued to experience growth in revenues and profits.
Rule 3. Hit ’em Where They Ain’t
Big companies usually aim at big markets and often ignore small but
profitable niche markets, which are ideal targets for small companies. 
Ashley Rosebrook and Stefan Peters entered a crowded personal-
ized photo printing industry with their Web site Pinhole Press. When 
researching the industry, they found that most of the competition
offered too many choices for the most common customer—new
grandparents and parents. By creating a simple site that is easy to
use, Pinhole found a niche in the market. The founders recently sold 
Pinhole for $33 million to a large software company.
Rule 4. Hire the Best—and Train Them
Small companies usually cannot afford to pay the highest wages 
in an area; however, because their companies are small, entrepre-
neurs have the opportunity to create a work environment in which 
employees can thrive. For instance, one small company attracts and 
retains quality workers by allowing them to use flexible work sched-
ules that make it easier for them to manage their busy lives. The 
owner also invests heavily in training workers so that they can move
up the organization—and the pay scale—faster. The training pays 
off, however, in the form of greater productivity, lower turnover,
increased customer satisfaction, and higher sales per employee.
Paying attention to seemingly small details, such as more commu-
nication, frequent recognition for jobs well done, less bureaucracy, 
and flexible benefits, enables small companies to build a loyal,
motivated workforce that can outperform those at larger companies.
Rule 5. Bring Back What the Big Boys 
Have Eliminated
Ron Samuels founded Avenue Bank in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2007, 
not long before the financial crisis rocked the banking industry. 
However, Avenue Bank not only survived one of the most difficult 
times in banking since the Great Depression, but the company’s old-
fashioned approach to banking also resulted in strong and steady 
growth. Avenue focuses on highly personalized service, which is no
longer available in many national bank chains. Avenue Bank offers 
the same personalized service to small businesses and entrepreneurs.
The bank works with start-ups by offering concierge services, work-
ing to meet their unique needs from start-up through growth.
Rule 6. Use the Cost Advantages 
of the Internet to Gain an Edge
Ernesto Perez-Carrillo Jr. and his family launched EPC Cigar as
a premium cigar company. The promotional channels for cigars 
include taxi-top advertising in large cities, commercials on cable 
channels, radio ads in large markets, and print ads in national 
business magazines and specialty publications that cater to the
wealthy. This type of advertising is quite costly and not always
highly effective. One ad might cost up to half EPC Cigar’s total 
marketing budget. Because the company could not afford a tradi-
tional advertising campaign, the company put its marketing bud-
get into the Internet, social media initiatives, trade shows, and
special events. EPC Cigar’s sales grew to more than $1.5 million in
revenue within the first year.
Rule 7. Be Great at Something Customers Value, 
t
Such as Service and Personal Attention
Do not make the mistake of choosing a “middle-of-the-road” 
strategy where, one writer says, there “are yellow lines, dead arma-
dillos, and once-great companies that are slowly going out of busi-
ness.” Successful small companies differentiate themselves from 
their larger, more powerful rivals by emphasizing superior, friendly,
personal service, something their size makes them uniquely capa-
ble of doing. Successful small companies also treat their customers 
like VIPs. Many small business owners know their customers by 
name, something that large companies cannot achieve. One of 
the best ways to determine exactly how to provide superior service
and personal attention is to identify your top five customers and 
periodically ask them, “How can we serve you better?”
Rule 8. Get Involved in the Community
Entrepreneurs can make their small companies stand out from the 
crowd by supporting events in their local communities. A big budget 
is not a prerequisite. For instance, Pizza Ranch franchises host “com-
munity impact” nights. Family members and friends of employees 
bus tables to help fundraising for local causes. Pizza Ranch donates
all of the evening’s tips plus a matching share of the profits. The
events generally draw additional donations from the community. 
The events help the franchises build relationships in the community 
and make genuine and enduring relationships with customers.

phone service and equipment. Landline phones reached their peak in 2001 when there were 
57 fixed landlines (business and residential) for every 100 people. Just a decade later, more than 
half of all American households did not have or use a landline phone. A survey of Chief Informa-
tion Officers found that 65 percent believed landline phones will likely disappear from everyday 
use by 2017. AT&T plans to end all landline service by the year 2020. Businesses that based their 
business models on the traditional landline phone system, such as companies manufacturing
copper wire and telephone switching systems, face the ultimate threat to their future survival.37
Many small businesses face a threat from larger rivals who offer lower prices because of 
their high-volume purchasing power, huge advertising budgets, and megastores that attract cus-
tomers for miles around. However, small businesses with the proper strategies in place do not
have to fold in the face of intense competition. The accompanying “Hands On . . . How To” fea-
ture explains that, with the proper strategy, small companies cannot only survive but also thrive 
in the shadow of larger, more powerful rivals.
Opportunities and threats are products of the interactions of forces, trends, and events outside 
the direct control of the business. These external forces have direct impact on the behavior of the 
markets in which the business operates, the behavior of competitors, and the behavior of customers. 
The number of potential threats facing a business is huge, but entrepreneurs should focus on the 
three or four most significant threats confronting their companies. Table 5.4 provides a simple ana-
lytical tool to help entrepreneurs identify the threats that pose the greatest danger to their companies.
The interactions of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats can be the most reveal-
ing aspects of using a SWOT analysis as part of a strategic plan. This analysis also requires entre-
preneurs to take an objective look at their businesses and the environment in which they operate, 
as they address many issues fundamental to their companies’ success in the future.
TABLE 5.4 Identifying and Managing Threats
Every business faces threats, but entrepreneurs cannot afford to be paranoid or paralyzed by fear when it comes to dealing with them. 
At the same time, they cannot afford to ignore threats that have the potential to destroy their businesses. The most productive approach 
to dealing with threats is to identify those that would have the most severe impact on a small company and those that have the highest 
probability of occurrence.
Research by Greg Hackett, president of management think tank MergerShop, has identified 12 major sources of risk that can wreak 
havoc on a company’s future. The following table helps entrepreneurs to determine the threats on which they should focus their attention.
Source
Specific 
Threat
Severity 
(1 = Low, 10 = High)
Probability of 
Occurrence (0 to 1)
Threat Rating (Severity ×
Probability, Max = 10)
1. Channels of distribution
2. Competition
3. Demographic changes
4. Globalization
5. Innovation

supplier loyalty
7. Offshoring or outsourcing
8. Stage in product life cycle
9. Government regulation
10. Influence of special 
interest groups
11. Influence of stakeholders
12. Changes in technology
Once entrepreneurs have identified specific threats facing their companies in the 12 areas (not necessarily all 12), they rate the 
severity of the impact of each one on their company on a 1 to 10 scale. Then they assign probabilities (between 0 and 1) to each threat. 
To calculate the Threat Score, entrepreneurs simply multiply the severity of each threat by its probability. (Maximum Threat Score 
is 10.) The higher a threat’s score, the more attention it demands. Typically, one or two threats stand out above all of the others, and 
entrepreneurs should focus on those.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Step 4. Identify the Key Factors for Success in the Business
KEY SUCCESS FACTORS Every business is characterized by controllable variables that determine 
the relative success of market participants. By focusing efforts to maximize their companies’ 
performance on these key success factors, entrepreneurs can achieve dramatic market advantages 
over their competitors. Companies that understand these key success factors tend to be leaders of 
the pack, whereas those that fail to recognize them become also-rans.
Key success factors (KSFs, also called key performance indicators) come in a variety of 
patterns, depending on the industry. Simply stated, these factors determine a company’s ability 
to compete successfully in an industry. Every company in an industry must understand the KSFs 
that drive the industry; otherwise, they are likely to become industry also-rans like the horses 
trailing the pack in the Kentucky Derby. Many of these sources of competitive advantages are 
based on cost factors, such as manufacturing cost per unit, distribution cost per unit, or develop-
ment cost per unit. Some are less tangible and less obvious but are just as important, such as su-
perior product quality, solid relationships with dependable suppliers, superior customer service, 
a highly trained and knowledgeable sales force, prime store locations, readily available customer 
credit, and many others. For example, one restaurant owner identified the following KSFs:
● Experience in the industry
● Sufficient start-up capital
● Tight cost control (labor costs, 15 to 18 percent of sales, and food costs, 35 to 40 percent 
of sales)
● Accurate sales forecasting, which minimizes wasted food
● Proper inventory control
● Meticulous cash management
● Choosing locations that maximize customer convenience
● Cleanliness
● High food quality
● Friendly and attentive service from a well-trained wait staff
● Consistency in quality and service over time
● Speed, particularly at lunch, when the restaurant attracts businesspeople who must dine 
quickly and get back to work
● A clear definition of the restaurant’s distinctive concept—its food, decor, service, and ambiance
These controllable variables determine the ability of any restaurant in this market segment 
to compete. Restaurants lacking these KSFs are not likely to survive, but those that build their 
strategies with these factors in mind will prosper. However, before entrepreneurs can build a 
strategy around the industry’s KSFs, they must identify them. Table 5.5 presents a form to help 
owners identify the most important success factors in the industry and their implications for their 
companies.
Identifying the KSFs in an industry allows entrepreneurs to determine where they should 
focus their companies’ resources strategically. It is unlikely that a company, even a large one, can 
excel on every KSF it identifies. Therefore, as they begin to develop their strategies, successful 
entrepreneurs focus on surpassing their rivals on one or two KSFs to build a sustainable competi-
tive edge. As a result, KSFs become the cornerstones of a company’s strategy. The last recession 
took a heavy toll on the casual dining sector of the restaurant industry, forcing many restaurants 
to refocus their attention on the KSFs in their respective market segments. At Chili’s and Cracker 
Barrel, managers targeted lunch customers by making changes designed to reduce food prepara-
tion and service times. Recognizing that shaving even a few minutes from a lunch visit makes a 
huge difference for the lunch crowd, managers simplified lunch menus, streamlined their service 
procedures, retrained wait staff, and redesigned their kitchen layouts for maximum efficiency.38

In the hotly competitive gourmet burger segment of the industry, entrepreneurs behind chains 
such as Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Blazing Onion Burger Company, and In-N-Out are empha-
sizing KSFs to fuel their growth: high-quality burgers made from fresh ingredients, clean res-
taurants, superior service, and prices that offer good value. Because customers wait 10 minutes 
and pay anywhere from $5 to more than $10 for a burger at fast-growing chains such as these,
managers make sure that customers understand that “this is not a typical fast-food burger joint.” 
At Five Guys, which was founded in 1986 by CEO Jerry Murrell, his wife, and three sons, 
customers enjoy French fries that are hand cut daily and burgers made from fresh beef. Five 
Guys, now with more than 1,000 locations, is the fastest-growing restaurant chain in the United 
States. The Blazing Onion Burger Company, a small chain based in Mill Creek, Washington,
offers customers 25 gourmet burgers made from fresh beef as well as a turkey burger, a veggie
burger, a meatloaf burger, and an assortment of homemade desserts. Service at Blazing Onion, 
founded by David Jones in 2007, is paramount. Each table has a “Service Alert” card that re-
sembles a stop sign; when customers post it, “we’ll be there in 30 seconds,” says Jones, who plans 
to open a new location every 10 months and recently began franchising.39
Step 5. Analyze the Competition
Ask most small business owners to identify the greatest challenge their companies face, and the 
most common response is competition. The Internet and e-commerce have increased the ferocity 
and the scope of the competition entrepreneurs face and have forced many business owners to 
change completely the ways in which they do business.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: PJ’s Coffee PJ’s Coffee of New Orleans was founded
seven years after Starbucks. While Starbucks grew to become the dominant global brand, 
PJ’s Coffee has focused on establishing a strong local brand in New Orleans and growing locations 
in the Gulf Coast region. PJ’s Coffee’s strong regional brand has made it difficult for Starbucks to 
penetrate this region. PJ’s Coffee follows a strategy that has been successful for many other re-
gional brands competing against strong national brands. PJ’s measures its success based on quality 
rather than quantity. Although Starbucks measures its success by the growth in number of retail 
outlets and market share, PJ’s developed strong relationships with its farmers and local roasters.
PJ’s knows its customers and has developed niche products in response. Its growth strategy is 
based on organic growth and expanding distribution into regional grocery outlets.40 ■
Keeping tabs on rivals’ movements through competitive intelligence programs is a vital stra-
tegic activity. “Business is like any battlefield. If you want to win the war, you have to know 
who you’re up against,” says one small business consultant.41 Unfortunately, most businesses are 
not very good at competitive intelligence: 97 percent of U.S. businesses do not systematically

track the progress of their key competitors.42 A study of business executives around the world by
McKinsey and Company reports that just 23 percent of companies discovered a major competi-
tive innovation by a competitor in time to be able to plan a response before the innovation hit the
market.43 The primary goals of a competitive intelligence program include the following:
● Conducting continuous rather than periodic analysis of competition
● Avoiding surprises from existing competitors’ new strategies and tactics
● Identifying potential new competitors
● Improving reaction time to competitors’ actions
● Anticipating rivals’ next strategic moves
COMPETITOR ANALYSIS Sizing up the competition gives a business owner a realistic view of 
the market and his or her company’s position in it. Yet not every competitor warrants the same 
level of attention in the strategic plan. Direct competitors offer the same products and services, 
When Chris Jeffery was in college at Penn State in 2003, he no-
ticed that very few restaurants had their menus posted on a Web 
site. Those that did have an Internet presence did not have online 
ordering for delivery or takeout. Jeffery started OrderUp to help 
restaurants and customers connect through its online platform.
After college, Jeffery proved the concept by licensing it to a 
small number of people. Once he had proof of concept, Jeffery 
was ready to scale and expand into other markets. He looked into 
raising venture capital but came away convinced that he would
rather find a way to grow the business in a way that he could 
maintain control of the company.
After operating as LionsMenu while Jeffery was in college 
and LocalUp when he was first testing the concept, he eventually 
chose the name OrderUp for his venture. Jeffery was able to raise 
seed money from an angel investor but relied mostly on boot-
strapping to establish a franchising model to grow the concept. 
However, Jeffery faced the challenge that no one had ever fran-
chised an online business before.
OrderUp offers its franchises for an up-front cost of $42,000, 
which covers the software system, training, and territorial rights 
to a specific area defined by phone number area codes. OrderUp 
handles all of the order processing and customer support via on-
line chat or telephone. OrderUp pays the restaurant for each order, 
after keeping 5 percent for the company and 5 to 9 percent for
its franchisee. Customers have the convenience of viewing a wide 
variety of menu items from several restaurants on one online location.
The franchisees are responsible for selling the service to local
restaurants and for connecting OrderUp with the local commu-
nity. Social media also is an important tool for expanding the sales
for each territory. Quick service restaurants are the most receptive 
to the OrderUp model. In many markets, franchisees are forging 
partnerships with restaurants to create special promotions, fea-
tured menu items, and even new products. Franchisees who are 
able to meet sales targets can earn more than $100,000 a year.
Bill Proferes, a veteran restaurateur, is an example of a suc-
cessful OrderUp franchisee. After one year as owner of the Norfolk,
Virginia, franchise, Proferes bought additional franchise rights in
Norfolk. Proferes has signed up dozens of local restaurants to be 
partners with his OrderUp franchise.
By its 10th year in business, OrderUp had grown to 32 markets
in 18 states, had more than 1,000 restaurants signed up to partici-
pate in its program, and had more than 400,000 registered users.
The company plans to continue this growth into mid-sized 
markets across the country, but faces competition from other 
companies developing online restaurant ordering Web sites and
mobile applications.

and customers often compare prices, features, and deals from these competitors as they shop.
Significant competitors offer some of the same products and services. Although their product 
or service lines may be somewhat different, there is competition with them in several key areas. 
Indirect competitors offer the same or similar products or services only in a small number of 
areas, and their target customers seldom overlap yours. Entrepreneurs should monitor closely the 
actions of their direct competitors, maintain a solid grasp of where their significant competitors 
are heading, and spend only minimal resources tracking their indirect competitors.
Collecting competitive intelligence enables entrepreneurs to update their knowledge of top 
competitors by answering the following questions:
● What are the primary criteria customers used to choose among competitive businesses in
your industry?
● Who are your primary competitors? Where are they located?
● What distinctive competencies have they developed?
● How do their cost structures compare to yours? Their financial resources?
● How do they promote their products and services?
● What do customers say about them? How do customers describe their products or services, 
their way of doing business, and the additional services they might supply?
● What are their key strategies?
● What are their strengths? How can your company counteract them?
● What are their major weaknesses? How can your company capitalize on them?
● Are new competitors entering the business?
According to the Society of Competitive Intelligence, 95 percent of the competitive intel-
ligence information is available from public sources that anyone can access—if they know how.44
Gathering competitive intelligence does not require entrepreneurs to engage in activities that 
are unethical, illegal, or unsavory (such as dumpster diving). One expert says competitive in-
telligence involves “taking information from the public domain, adding it to what you know 
about your company and your industry, and looking for patterns.”45 By collecting many nuggets
of information about their competitors, entrepreneurs can assemble the pieces to make reliable 
inferences about their rivals’ overall strategies. Entrepreneurs can use the following low-cost 
competitive intelligence methods to collect information about their rivals:
● Read industry trade publications for announcements and news stories about competitors.
● Ask questions of customers and suppliers about what they hear competitors may be doing. 
In many cases, this information is easy to gather because some people love to gossip.
● Regularly debrief employees, especially sales representatives and purchasing agents.
Experts estimate that 70 to 90 percent of the competitive information a company needs 
already resides with employees who collect it in their routine dealings with suppliers, cus-
tomers, and other industry contacts.46
● Attend industry “meet-ups” in your local community.
● Attend trade shows and collect competitors’ sales literature.
● Monitor social media for insights into your direct competitors.
● Watch for employment ads and job postings from competitors; knowing what types of 
workers they are hiring can tell you a great deal about their future plans.
● Conduct patent searches for patents competitors have filed. This gives important clues 
about new products they are developing.
● Learn about the kinds and amounts of equipment and raw materials that competitors are import-
ing by studying the Journal of Commerce Port Import Export Reporting Service (PIERS) data-
base. These clues can alert an entrepreneur to new products that a competitor is about to launch.

210
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
● If appropriate, buy competitors’ products and assess their quality and features. Benchmark 
their products against yours.
● Obtain credit reports on each of your major competitors to evaluate their financial condi-
tion. For less than $200, Dun & Bradstreet and other research firms provide detailed credit 
reports of competitors that can be helpful in a strategic analysis.
● Publicly held companies must file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, including quarterly 10-Q and annual 10-K reports. Information on publicly held 
companies is available at the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site.
● Investigate Uniform Commercial Code reports. Banks file these with the state whenever 
they make loans to businesses. These reports often include the amount of the loan and
what it is for.
● Check out the resources of your local library, including articles, computerized databases, 
and online searches. Press releases, which often announce important company news, can 
be an important source of competitive intelligence. Many companies supply press releases
through the PR Newswire. For local competitors, review back issues of the area newspaper 
for articles on and advertisements by competitors.
● Visit competitors’ Web sites periodically to see what news is contained there. The 
Web enables small companies to uncover valuable competitive information at little or 
no cost.
● Sign up for competitors’ social media feeds for current news about their businesses.
● Visit competing businesses periodically to observe their operations. Tom Stemberg, CEO 
of Staples, a chain of office supply superstores, says, “I’ve never visited a store where 
I didn’t learn something.”47
● Don’t resort to unethical or illegal practices.
Entrepreneurs can use the results of their competitive intelligence efforts to construct a com-
petitive profile matrix for its most important competitors. A competitive profile matrix allows 
owners to evaluate their firms against the major competitor using the KSFs for that market seg-
ment. The first step is to list the KSFs identified in step 4 of the strategic planning process (refer 
to Table 5.5) and to attach weights to them reflecting their relative importance. (For simplicity, 
the weights in this matrix sum add up to 1.00.) In this example, notice that product quality is 
weighted twice as heavily (twice as important) as price competitiveness.
The next step is to identify the company’s major competitors and to rate each one (and your 
company) on each of the KSFs:
If Factor Is a . . .
Rating Is . . .
Major weakness
1
Minor weakness
2
Minor strength
3
Major strength
4
Once the rating is completed, the owner simply multiplies the weight by the rating for each 
factor to get a weighted score and then adds up each competitor’s weighted scores to get a 
total weighted score. Table 5.6 shows a sample competitive profile matrix for a small com-
pany. The results show which company is strongest, which is weakest, and which of the KSFs
each one is best and worst at meeting. By carefully studying and interpreting the results, an 
entrepreneur can begin to envision the ideal strategy for building a competitive edge in his or 
her corner of the market. Notice that the small company profiled in Table 5.6 should empha-
size the competitive advantages it holds over its rivals in quality and perception of value in its 
business strategy.

In his book Break from the Pack, Oren Harari explains how busi-
ness owners can escape the problems of the “Copycat Economy,
where everyone has access to the same resources and talent, 
where the Web is the great equalizer, and where the market’s
twin foundations are imitation and commoditization.” He argues 
that too many businesses are stuck in the pack with “me-too” 
products and services that customers see as commodities. The
danger of being stuck in the pack (or relying on a “middle-of-the-
road strategy”) is becoming what entrepreneur Terry Brock calls 
“disgustingly generic.” What can small companies, which often 
lack the resources that large companies have, do to break from
the pack strategically? Consider the lessons we can learn from the 
following small businesses that all rely on subscription services.
Dollar Shave Club
Michael Dubin, CEO of Dollar Shave Club, effectively uses social me-
dia to successfully compete with well-established national brands 
Schick and Gillette. Dollar Shave Club sends out razors to its subscrib-
ers that cost $1, $3, or $9 per month. The products are simple in 
design but are made of high quality materials. Dollar Shave Club part-
ners with an overseas manufacturer. The 38 employees who work for
Dollar Shave Club focus on marketing, order fulfillment, and product 
development. The company’s YouTube video features Dubin, who 
uses humor and passion to try to convince people to buy shaving 
goods by mail rather than from the grocery store. The YouTube Dollar 
Shave Club commercial was viewed more than 13 million times in
just two years and attracted hundreds of thousands of subscribers.
Citrus Lane
Mauria Finley used her own experience as a new mother to de-
velop the business model for her company, Citrus Lane. Like many 
first-time mothers planning for the arrival of their first babies, 
Finley spent months planning her business model. She sent out
e-mails to all her friends who already had babies, seeking advice 
on their favorite products and brands. Her e-mail in box was soon
full of recommendations for a wide variety of products for her 
new baby. She realized other new mothers could benefit from the 
same wisdom from experienced mothers that she had received
Citrus Lane is a subscription service that sends new parents “care
packages” of products recommended by a panel of advisers and 
by Citrus Lane customers. Subscribers pay $25 per month to get 
a package with age-appropriate products for their children. Ven-
ture capital firms have endorsed the Citrus Lane concept with two 
rounds of financing of more than $6 million.
For the Makers
For the Makers is a subscription business built on the popularity
of at-home craft projects. For the Makers sends its subscribers a 
monthly box that contains instructions and materials for four to
six small craft projects. Most of the projects are jewelry or simi-
lar trinkets and take less than an hour to complete. Cofounders 
Janet Crowther and Katie Covington, who have past experience
designing for national fashion brands, dream up the projects and 
develop the detailed instructions on how to make each project. 
The company also provides online tutorials for all of the projects 
it sells. For the Makers charges subscribers $29 per month for the 
materials and online support.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Step 6. Create Company Goals and Objectives
Before entrepreneurs can build a comprehensive set of strategies, they must first establish busi-
ness goals and objectives, which give them targets to aim for and provide a basis for evaluating 
their companies’ performance. Without them, it is impossible to know where a business is going
or how well it is performing. The following conversation between Alice and the Cheshire Cat, 
taken from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, illustrates the importance of creating meaning-
ful goals and objectives as part of the strategic management process:48
“Would you tell me please, which way I ought to go from here?” asked Alice.
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where . . .,” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
A small business that “doesn’t much care where” it wants to go (i.e., one that has no goals and objec-
tives) will find that “it really doesn’t matter which way” it chooses to go (i.e., its strategy is irrelevant).
GOALS The broad, long-range attributes that a business seeks to accomplish are its goals; they tend to 
be general and sometimes even abstract. Goals are not intended to be specific enough for a manager 
to act on but simply state the general level of accomplishment sought. Do you want to boost your 
market share? Does your cash balance need strengthening? Would you like to enter a new market 
or increase sales in a current one? Do you want to develop new products or services? Researchers 
Jim Collins and Jerry Porras studied a large group of businesses for their book Good to Great and 
t
determined that one of the factors that set apart successful companies from unsuccessful ones was
the formulation of ambitious, clear, and inspiring long-term goals. Collins and Porras called them
BHAGs (“Big Hairy Audacious Goals,” pronounced “bee-hags”) and suggest that their main benefit 
is to inspire and focus a company on important actions that are consistent with its overall mission.49
Figure 5.3 shows that effective BHAGs originate at the intersection of a company’s mission, vision,
and values; its distinctive competencies; and its KSFs. Addressing these broad issues will help 
entrepreneurs focus on the next phase—developing specific, realistic objectives.
OBJECTIVES Objectives are more specific targets of performance. Common objectives concern
profitability, productivity, growth, efficiency, sales, financial resources, physical facilities, 
organizational structure, employee welfare, and social responsibility. Because some of these 
objectives might conflict with one another, it is important to establish priorities. Which objectives 
are most important? Which are least important? Arranging objectives in a hierarchy according to 
their priority can help an entrepreneur resolve conflicts when they arise. Well-written objectives 
have the following characteristics:
They are specific. Objectives should be quantifiable and precise. For example, “to achieve 
a healthy growth in sales” is not a meaningful objective; however, “to increase retail sales

by 12 percent and wholesale by 10 percent in the next fiscal year” is precise and spells out 
exactly what management wants to accomplish.
They are measurable. Managers should be able to plot the organization’s progress toward 
its objectives; this requires a well-defined reference point from which to start and a scale 
for measuring progress.
They are action commitments. Objectives are linked to specific actions. Ideally, managers 
and employees should be able to see how their jobs lead to the company achieving its ob-
jectives. ProviderTrust is a healthcare software company that is backed by venture capital, 
which means that the management team has specific revenue growth objectives investors
expect the company to reach. The company holds 10- to 15-minute meetings with all 
11 employees at the start of every day during which team members can talk about what 
they are working on to help the company achieve its revenue objectives.50
They are assignable. Unless an entrepreneur assigns responsibility for an objective to 
an individual, it is unlikely that the company will ever achieve it. Creating objectives 
without giving someone responsibility for accomplishing them is futile. Accountability 
is the key.
They are realistic yet challenging. Objectives must be within the reach of the organiza-
tion, or motivation will disappear. In any case, managerial expectations must remain 
high. In other words, the more challenging an objective is (within realistic limits), the 
higher the performance will be. Set objectives that will challenge your business and its
employees.
They are timely. Objectives must specify not only what is to be accomplished but also
when it is to be accomplished. A time frame for achievement is important.
They are written down. Setting objectives does not have to be complex; in fact, an entre-
preneur should keep the number of objectives relatively small (from 5 to 10). Writing down 
objectives makes them more concrete and makes it easy to communicate them to everyone 
in the company.
The strategic planning process works best when managers and employees work together 
to set goals and objectives. Developing a plan is top management’s responsibility, but execut-
ing it falls to managers and employees; therefore, encouraging them to participate broadens the 
plan’s perspective and increases the motivation to make the plan work. Unfortunately, although 
65 percent of companies have a clear strategy, only 14 percent of employees understand their 
role in implementing the company’s strategies.51 A recent study by SuccessFactors reports that 
companies that set goals, align them with their companies’ overall strategy, and measure employ-
ees’ performance against those goals using multiple benchmarks financially outperform compa-
nies that do not. SuccessFactors cites three primary benefits of an effective goal-setting process: 
(1) increased profitability, (2) faster execution of company strategy, and (3) reduced employee
turnover.52
Step 7. Formulate Strategic Options and Select the Appropriate Strategies
By this point in the strategic management process, entrepreneurs should have a clear picture of 
what their businesses do best and what their competitive advantages are. They also should under-
stand their firms’ weaknesses and limitations as well as those of their competitors. The next step
is to evaluate strategic options and then prepare a game plan designed to achieve the stated mis-
sion, goals, and objectives.
STRATEGY A strategy is a road map of the actions an entrepreneur draws up to accomplish a
company’s mission, goals, and objectives. In other words, the mission, goals, and objectives 
spell out the ends, and the strategy defines the means for reaching them. A strategy is the 
master plan that covers all the major parts of the organization and ties them together into a 
unified whole. The plan must be action oriented; it should breathe life into the entire planning
process. An entrepreneur must build a sound strategy based on the preceding steps that uses the 
strategy

an entrepreneur draws up 
to fulfill the company’s mis-
sion, goals, and objectives.

company’s core competencies and strengths as the springboard to success. Joseph Picken and 
Gregory Dess, authors of Mission Critical: The 7 Strategic Traps That Derail Even the Smartest 
Companies, write, “A flawed strategy—no matter how brilliant the leadership, no matter how 
effective the implementation—is doomed to fail. A sound strategy, implemented without error, 
wins every time.”53
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Zina and Jason Santos and August Kitchen August
Kitchen offers a meal starter for hamburgers, called J-BURGER, which was born in the 
kitchen of Zina and Jason Santos. Their friends kept wanting to take home some of the meal 
starter the couple used to zest up their burgers. In 2009, they invested about $100,000 of their 
own funds to try commercializing their product. Their first product was J-BURGER (the “J” is
for Jason). To ensure that its product is fresh, which is a big selling point, August Kitchen part-
nered with a packager that could produce small batches tied to grocery store orders. Getting 
shelf space and building consumer awareness of J-BURGER has been a challenge. The Santoses 
spent many hours cooking mini-burgers to entice shoppers to take J-BURGER home with them. 
By working with stores that support local products and by listening to what consumers want, 
the company is gaining market acceptance. More than 60 retailers in 11 states now carry 
August Kitchen products. August Kitchen has added J-CHILI and J-MEATLOAF meal starters to 
its product line.54 ■
A successful strategy is comprehensive and well integrated, focusing on establishing the
KSFs that the entrepreneur identified in step 4. For instance, if maximum shelf space is a KSF for 
a small manufacturer’s product, the strategy must identify techniques for gaining more in-store 
shelf space (e.g., offering higher margins to distributors and brokers than competitors do, assist-
ing retailers with in-store displays, or redesigning a wider, more attractive package).

CHAPTER 5 • CRAFTING A BUSINESS PLAN AND BUILDING A SOLID STRATEGIC PLAN
215
THREE STRATEGIC OPTIONS Obviously, the number of strategies from which the small business
owner can choose is infinite. When all the glitter is stripped away, however, three basic strategies 
remain. In his classic book Competitive Strategy, Michael Porter defines these strategies: (1) cost 
leadership, (2) differentiation, and (3) focus (see Figure 5.4).55
COST LEADERSHIP A company pursuing a cost leadership strategy strives to be the lowest-
cost producer relative to its competitors in the industry. Many companies attempt to compete
by offering low prices, but low costs are a prerequisite for success. Low-cost leaders have a 
competitive advantage in reaching buyers whose primary purchase criterion is price, and they 
have the power to set the industry’s price floor. This strategy works well when buyers are sensitive 
to price changes, when competing firms sell the same commodity products and compete on the 
basis of price, and when companies can benefit from economies of scale. Not only is a low-cost 
leader in the best position to defend itself in a price war, but it also can use its power to attack 
competitors with the lowest price in the industry.
There are many ways to build a low-cost strategy, but the most successful cost leaders know
where they have cost advantages over their competitors, and they use these as the foundation for 
their strategies. Successful cost leaders often find low-cost suppliers (or use a vertical integration 
strategy to produce their own products), eliminate the inefficiencies in their channels of distribu-
tion, use the Internet to cut costs, and operate more efficiently than their competitors. They are 
committed to squeezing every unnecessary cost out of their operations.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Eric Casaburi and Retro Fitness Eric Casaburi, founder 
and CEO of Retro Fitness, pursues a low-cost strategy in a highly competitive industry. Retro 
Fitness offers gym memberships at a rock bottom price of $19.99 per month in its more than 
100 fitness centers in 13 states. Featuring a 1980s theme, Retro Fitness offers quality equipment 
and service with no additional frills. Casaburi keeps costs down by negotiating deals with suppliers 
and by carefully selecting low-cost sites. Instead of building 30,000-square-foot gyms, Retro Fit-
ness is able to fit everything its customers need within a space one-third that size, which saves a
significant amount of rent expense each month. Retro Fitness also offers additional products its 
customers want, such as smoothies, training sessions, and clothing, which adds to the monthly 
revenue per customer. The company offers an app as part of membership that allows customers to 
track their workouts, measure progress toward goals, make an appointment with a trainer, and 
order a smoothie from the smoothie bar. Casaburi plans to have 300 locations by 2018.56 ■
Of course, there are dangers in following a cost leadership strategy. Sometimes a company 
focuses exclusively on lower manufacturing costs, without considering the impact of purchasing, dis-
tribution, or overhead costs. Another danger is incorrectly identifying the company’s true cost driv-
ers. Although their approach to managing is characterized by frugality, companies that understand 
cost leadership are willing to invest in those activities that drive costs out of doing business, whether 
it is technology, preventive maintenance, or some other factor. In addition, over time, competitors 
may erode a company’s cost advantage by finding ways to lower their own costs. Finally, a firm may 
pursue a low-cost leadership strategy so zealously that, in its drive to push costs downward, it elimi-
nates product or service features that customers consider to be essential.
Under the right conditions, a cost leadership strategy executed properly can be an incredibly 
powerful strategic weapon. Small discount retailers that live in the shadows of Wal-Mart and 
thrive even when the economy slows succeed by relentlessly pursuing low-cost strategies. Small
chains, such as Fred’s, Dollar General, Family Dollar, 99 Cents Only, and Dollar Tree, cater to

low- and middle-income customers who live in inner cities or rural areas. They offer inexpensive 
products such as food, health and beauty products, cleaning supplies, clothing, and seasonal mer-
chandise, and many of the items they stock are closeout buys (purchases made as low as 10 cents 
on the dollar) on brand-name merchandise. These companies also strive to keep their overhead 
costs as low as possible. For instance, 99 Cents Only, whose name describes its merchandising 
strategy, is housed in a no-frills warehouse in an older section of City of Commerce, California.57
By keeping their costs low, these retailers offer customers prices that are within 1 to 2 percent of 
those at Wal-Mart, even though they do not benefit from the quantity discounts that the low-cost 
giant does. The success of these stores proves that companies pursuing a cost leadership strategy 
must emphasize cost containment in every decision, from where to locate the company headquar-
ters to which items to stock.
DIFFERENTIATION A company following a differentiation strategy seeks to build customer 
loyalty by selling goods or services that provide unique attributes and that customers perceive to 
be superior to competing products. That, in turn, enables the business to command higher prices
for its products or services than competitors. There are many ways to create a differentiation
strategy, but the key is to be unique at something that is important to the customer. In other words, 
a business strives to be better than its competitors at something customers value.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jenn and Phillip Tompkins 
and RentTheChicken.com Jenn and Phillip Tompkins
started RentTheChicken.com in Freeport, Pennsylvania, to take 
advantage of the growing interest in backyard, suburban farms. 
RentTheChicken.com takes the risk out of backyard farming for
the first-time urban farmers. Every spring, the company brings 
two egg-laying chickens and all of the necessary supplies to its 
customers who are all located within about an hour of the com-
pany’s headquarters. The Tompkins offer lessons to clients to help 
ensure their success at raising chickens. The chicken rental and
supplies costs $350 a season. Then in the fall, RentTheChicken
.com picks up the chickens to keep them safe and warm over the 
winter. If predators eat any of the rented chickens, the chickens 
are replaced at no cost. However, if a chicken dies from neglect, 
RentTheChicken.com picks up the equipment and charges the 
customer a fee. Environmentalists praise the business model be-
cause it reduces the number of chickens that end up in animal 
shelters after would-be urban farmers find raising chickens to be
more work than they had assumed.58 ■
If a small company can improve a product’s (or service’s) 
performance, reduce the customer’s cost and risk of purchasing
it, or provide intangible benefits that customers value (such as status, prestige, exclusivity, or a
sense of safety), it has the potential to be a successful differentiator. Companies that execute a 
differentiation strategy successfully can charge premium prices for their products and services, 
increase their market share, and reap the benefits of customer loyalty and retention. To be suc-
cessful, a business must make its product or service truly different, at least in the eyes of its 
customers.
Although few businesses are innately as unique as RentTheChicken.com, the goal for a
company pursuing a differentiation strategy is to create that kind of uniqueness in the minds of 
its customers. The key to a successful differentiation strategy is to build it on a core competency 
something a small company is uniquely good at doing in comparison to its competitors. Common
bases for differentiation include superior customer service, special product features, complete 
product lines, instantaneous parts availability, absolute product reliability, supreme product qual-
ity, and extensive product knowledge. To be successful, a differentiation strategy must create the 
perception of value in the customer’s eyes. No customer purchases a good or service that fails 
to produce its perceived value, no matter how real that value may be. One business consultant 
advises, “Make sure you tell your customers and prospects what it is about your business that 
makes you different. Make sure that difference is on the form of a true benefit to the customer.”59

217
Small companies encounter risks when pursuing a differentiation strategy. One danger is 
trying to differentiate a product or service on the basis of something that does not boost its per-
formance or lower its cost to customers. Another pitfall is trying to differentiate on the basis of 
something customers do not see as important. Business owners also must consider how long they
can sustain a product’s or service’s differentiation; changing customer tastes may make the basis 
for differentiation temporary. Imitations and “knockoffs” from competitors also pose a threat to
a successful differentiation strategy. For instance, designers of high-priced original clothing see 
much cheaper knockoff products on the market shortly after their designs hit the market. Another 
pitfall is over-differentiating and charging so much that the company prices its products out of 
the market. The final risk is focusing only on the physical characteristics of a product or service 
and ignoring important psychological factors, such as status, prestige, and image, which can be
powerful sources of differentiation.
FOCUS A focus strategy recognizes that not all markets are homogeneous. In fact, in any given 
market, there are many different customer segments, each having different needs, wants, and 
characteristics. Businesses with a focus strategy sell to these specific segments rather than try
to sell to the mass market. Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, in his book The 
Long Tail, explains that the digital age has opened up smaller niche market segments to smaller 
businesses, creating a long tail of niche markets (see Figure 5.5). Three drivers create the long 
tail of the market:60
1. The tools of production are more affordable. Software and hardware are now much 
cheaper to buy and easier to use. For instance, in the past, musical artists recorded their 
work in a studio at a cost of thousands of dollars per song. Today, musicians no longer have 
to rely on large record companies to produce their music. With affordable software such as 
Pro Tools, artists can record and edit music with a personal computer or laptop anywhere. 
The quality of these recordings is so high that it is almost impossible to tell the difference 
between a recording made in a professional recording studio and one made in an artist’s
living room.
2. The Internet has created better access to niche markets. Internet aggregators can pull to-
gether all of the products consumers may possibly want. Amazon, iTunes, eBay, and many 
other Internet retailers have opened up distribution to many small businesses that would
never have been able to achieve such broad market exposure. In addition, the company Web 
site is now a tool to reach consumers directly through digital advertising and social media.
3. Search tools make it easier to reach specific consumers. Search engines and recom-
mendations available through Web sites and social media drive consumers to specific 
products and services on the Internet that meet their particular needs. For example, a con-
sumer who traveled to the Czech Republic and wanted to buy some Czech crystal after 
getting home can easily search for Czech crystal manufacturers that ship abroad.

focus strategy
a strategy in which a com-
pany selects one or more 
market segments; identifies 
customers’ special needs, 
wants, and interests; and 
approaches them with a 
good or service designed 
to excel in meeting those 
needs, wants, and interests.  

218
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
The principal idea of a focus strategy is to select one (or more) segment(s); identify custom-
ers’ special needs, wants, and interests; and provide them with goods or services designed to
excel in meeting these needs, wants, and interests. By focusing on small market niches, focus 
strategies build on differences among market segments. Because they are small, flexible, and at-
tentive to their customers’ particular needs, small companies can be successful in niches that are 
too narrow for their larger competitors to enter profitably. These companies focus on a narrow
segment of the overall market and set themselves apart either by becoming cost leaders in the 
segment or by differentiating themselves from competitors.
Focus strategies will become more prevalent among small businesses in the future as indus-
tries increasingly become dumbbell shaped, with a few large companies dominating one end, 
a relatively small number of mid-sized businesses in the middle, and a large number of small 
businesses operating at the other end. A study by Intuit and the Institute for the Future on the 
small business environment in 2018, The Intuit Future of Small Business Report, cites increas-
ingly fragmented markets, customers who demand products and services that are tailored to their 
specific needs, and advancements that give small companies affordable access to increasingly 
sophisticated technology as key factors that will make narrow markets increasingly suitable for 
small businesses to thrive. The report concludes that “there will be increasing opportunities for 
small businesses to flourish in niches left untouched by global giants.”61
In fact, serving specific target segments or niches rather than the attempting to reach the total 
market is the essence of a focus strategy, making it ideally suited to small businesses, which often
lack the resources to reach the overall market. Their goal is to serve their narrow target markets
more effectively and efficiently than competitors that pound away at the broad market. Com-
mon bases for building a focus strategy include zeroing in on a small geographic area, targeting 
a group of customers with similar needs or interests (e.g., left-handed people), specializing in a 
specific product or service (e.g., Batteries Plus Bulbs, a store that sells and services every kind
of battery and bulb imaginable), or selling specialized knowledge (e.g., restoring valuable and 
priceless works of art).
Because of their size and agility, small companies are particularly well suited for serving 
niche markets that are part of the long tail. The most successful focusers build a competitive edge 
by concentrating on specific market niches and serving them better than competitors—
even powerful giants—can. Norm Brodsky, a highly successful serial entrepreneur, says 
that small companies can develop close relationships with their customers. He stresses 
that they can be much more nimble and react more quickly than their larger competiiors, 
which often take a cookie-cutter approach to running their portfolio of stores.62
A focus strategy depends on creating value for customers either by being the lowest-
cost producer or by differentiating the product or service in a unique fashion but doing 
it in a narrow target segment. To be worth targeting, a niche must be large enough to be
profitable, reachable with marketing media, and capable of sustaining a business over 
time (i.e., not a passing fad). Many small companies operate quite successfully in small,
yet profitable, niches.
Market niches do not have to be glamorous to be profitable. Joshua Opperman lost a 
fiancée, but discovered a market need and a simple business model to exploit it. When his
fiancée called off their marriage, he tried to sell the engagement ring he had purchased
back to the jeweler. When the store only offered him just $3,500 for a ring he paid $10,000
for just a few months earlier, he started his company, I Do, Now I Don’t, to help people
to sell engagement rings and other jewelry with a system that works like Craigslist. The
company facilitates more than 150 transactions a month, taking a 15 percent commission 
on all successful sales through its Web site.63
Although it can be a highly profitable strategy, pursuing a focus strategy is not with-
out risks. Companies sometimes struggle to capture a large enough share of a small mar-
ket to be profitable. If a small company is successful in a niche, there is also the danger 
of larger competitors entering the market and eroding it. Entrepreneurs following this 
strategy often face a constant struggle to keep costs down; the small volume of business
that some niches support pushes production costs upward, making a company vulner-
able to lower-cost competitors as their prices spiral higher. Sometimes a company with a 
successful niche strategy gets distracted by its success and tries to branch out into other

areas. As it drifts farther away from its core strategy, it loses its competitive edge and runs the risk 
of confusing or alienating its customers. Muddying its image with customers puts a company in
danger of losing its identity.
Step 8. Translate Strategic Plans into Action Plans
No strategic plan is complete until it is put into action; planning a company’s strategy and imple-
menting it go hand in hand. Entrepreneurs must convert strategic plans into operating plans that 
guide their companies on a daily basis and become a visible, active part of the business. No small
business can benefit from a strategic plan sitting on a shelf collecting dust. Unfortunately, failure 
to implement a strategy effectively is a common problem. The lesson is that even sound strate-
gies, unless properly implemented, will fail.
EXECUTING THE STRATEGY Research by Mark Huselid, Brian Becker, and Richard Beatty shows
that proper execution of a company’s strategy accounts for 85 percent of a company’s financial 
performance.64 Implementing a strategy successfully requires both a process that fits a company’s 
culture and the right people committed to making that process work. Getting the right people in 
place starts with the selection process but includes every other aspect of the human resources 
function—from job design and training to motivational methods and compensation. To make 
their strategic plans workable, entrepreneurs should divide them into projects, carefully defining 
each one by the following:
Purpose. What is the project designed to accomplish?
Scope. Which areas of the company will be involved in the project?
Contribution. How does the project relate to other projects and to the overall strategic 
plan?
Resource requirements. What human and financial resources are needed to complete the 
project successfully?
Timing. Which schedules and deadlines will ensure project completion?
Once entrepreneurs assign priorities to projects, they can begin to implement the strategic plan. 
Involving employees and delegating adequate authority to them is essential because these pro-
jects affect them most directly. If an organization’s people have been involved in the strategic 
management process to this point, they will have a better grasp of the steps they must take to 
achieve the organization’s goals as well as their own professional goals. Early involvement of the 
workforce in the strategic management process is a luxury that larger businesses cannot achieve.
Commitment to reaching the company’s objectives is a powerful force, but involvement is a pre-
requisite for achieving total employee commitment. The greater the level of involvement of those 
who will implement a company’s strategy (often those at the lower levels of an organization) in 
the process of creating the strategy (often the realm of those at the top of an organization), the 
more likely the strategy is to be successful. Without a team of committed, dedicated employees, 
a company’s strategy, no matter how precisely planned, usually fails.
Step 9. Establish Accurate Controls
So far, the planning process has created company objectives and has developed a strategy for 
reaching them, but rarely, if ever, will the company’s actual performance match stated objectives. 
Entrepreneurs quickly realize the need to control actual results that deviate from plans.
CONTROLLING THE STRATEGY Planning without control has little operational value; therefore, 
a sound planning program requires a practical control process. The plans and objectives created 
in the strategic planning process become the standards against which actual performance is 
measured. It is important for everyone in the organization to understand—and to be involved in—
the planning and controlling process. Unless entrepreneurs measure progress against the goals and
objectives established in step 6, their companies make little progress toward accomplishing them.
Controlling plans and projects and keeping them on schedule means that an entrepre-
neur must identify and track key performance indicators. The source of these indicators is the 

220
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
operating data from the company’s normal business activity; they are the guideposts for detecting 
deviations from established standards. Financial, production, sales, inventory, quality, customer 
service and satisfaction, and other operating records are primary sources of data managers can 
use to control activities. For example, on a customer service project, performance indicators 
might include the number of customer complaints, the number of orders returned, the percentage 
of on-time shipments, and a measure of order accuracy.
The most commonly used indicators of a company’s performance are financial measures; 
however, judging a company’s performance solely on the basis of financial measures can lead 
to strategic myopia. To judge the effectiveness of their strategies, many companies are develop-
ing balanced scorecards, a set of multidimensional measurements that are unique to a company 
and that incorporate both financial and operational measures to give managers a quick yet com-
prehensive picture of the company’s overall performance. As one writer explains, a balanced 
scorecard
is a sophisticated business model that helps a company understand what’s really driving
its success. It acts a bit like the control panel on a spaceship—the business equivalent of 
a flight speedometer, odometer, and temperature gauge all rolled into one. It keeps track 
of many things, including financial progress and softer measurements—everything from 
customer satisfaction to return on investment—that need to be managed to reach the final 
destination: profitable growth.65
Rather than sticking solely to the traditional financial measures of a company’s performance, 
the balanced scorecard gives managers a comprehensive view from both a financial and an op-
erational perspective. The premise behind such a scorecard is that relying on any single measure 
of company performance is dangerous. Just as a pilot in command of a jet cannot fly safely by 
focusing on a single instrument, an entrepreneur cannot manage a company by concentrating on 
a single measurement. The complexity of managing a business demands that an entrepreneur 
be able to see performance measures in several areas simultaneously. “Knowing whether an 
enterprise is viable or not doesn’t mean looking at just the bottom line,” says one manager.66
Scoreboards that combine relevant results from all aspects of the operation allow everyone in 
the organization to see how their job performance connects to a company’s mission, goals, and 
objectives.
When creating balanced scorecards for their companies, entrepreneurs should create mean-
ingful measures for each mission-related objective they established in step 6. If used properly, 
a balanced scorecard serves as a call to action. When a key indicator is out of control, everyone 
in the company knows it and can work together to do something about it quickly. The keys to 
using scorecards successfully are making sure that the measures included are important to the 
company’s success and that each one tells a different story.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Alex Phinn: Griff Paper and Film Alex Phinn, president 
of Griff Paper and Film, a maker of protective films, silicone-coated liners, and specialty
labeling materials, looks over his company’s balanced scorecard with his morning cup of coffee. 
Rather than use one of the many balanced scorecard software packages available, Phinn designed 
his own scorecard. His one-page report includes operating data such as new orders received, the 
number of quotations submitted to potential customers (both measures of future sales), the num-
ber of customer complaints, employee absentee rates (both quality indicators), and financial data, 
such as daily accounts receivables, accounts payables, and cash balances. Phinn’s easy-to-use score-
card gives him and his employees the ability to spot problem areas and positive trends in the 
company quickly.67 ■
Ideally, a balanced scorecard looks at a business from five important perspectives (see 
Figure 5.6).68
CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE How do customers see us? Customers judge companies by at least 
four standards: time (how long it takes the company to deliver a good or service), quality (how 
well a company’s product or service performs in terms of reliability, durability, and accuracy), 
performance (the extent to which a good or service performs as expected), and service (how well 
a company meets or exceeds customers’ expectations of value). Because customer-related goals

are external, managers must translate them into measures of what the company must do to meet 
customers’ expectations.
INTERNAL BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE At what must we excel? The internal factors on which man-
agers should focus are those that have the greatest impact on customer satisfaction and retention 
and on company effectiveness and efficiency. Developing goals and measures for factors such 
as quality, cycle time, productivity, cost control, and others that employees directly influence is 
essential.
INNOVATION AND LEARNING PERSPECTIVE Can we continue to improve and create value? This 
view of a company recognizes that the targets required for success are never static; they are
constantly changing. If a company wants to continue its pattern of success, it cannot stand still; 
it must continuously innovate and improve. Employee training and development are essential 
ingredients of this component. A company’s ability to innovate, learn, and improve determines
its future. These goals and measures emphasize the importance of continuous improvement in
customer satisfaction and internal business operations.
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE How do we look to shareholders? The most traditional performance 
measures, financial standards, tell how much the company’s overall strategy and its execution are 
contributing to its bottom line. These measures focus on such factors as profitability, growth, and

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tesco’s Corporate Steering Wheel Tesco is a chain of
nearly 5,400 food and general merchandise stores based in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, United 
Kingdom, that operates in 14 markets in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is recognized as one
of the most successful grocery chains in the world. The company recently developed a balanced
scorecard called the Tesco Corporate Steering Wheel to implement and control its seven-part 
strategy. At the heart of the wheel is Tesco’s philosophy, “Every little bit helps.” Surrounding this 
are two customer-focused values statements (“No one tries harder for customers” and “Treat
people how we like to be treated”) that drive the way the company does business. The next ring 
shows 20 areas in which Tesco has developed specific objectives (e.g., “earn lifetime loyalty,” “be 
responsible, fair and honest,” “grow sales,” “an interesting job,” and others) that are separated
into the five perspectives described earlier: customer, community, operations, people, and finance
(see Figure 5.7). The Wheel works; Tesco’s sales increased 31 percent, and its profit increased
36 percent in just a three-year period.69 ■

Although the balanced scorecard is a vital tool that helps managers keep their companies 
on track, it is also an important tool for changing behavior in an organization and for keeping 
everyone focused on what really matters. Used properly, balanced scorecards allow managers to 
see how actions in each of the five dimensions of performance influence actions in the others. 
As competitive conditions and results change, managers can use the balanced scorecard to 
make corrections in plans, policies, strategies, and objectives to get performance back on track. 
A practical control system is also economical to operate. Most small businesses have no need for 
a sophisticated, expensive control system. The system should be so practical that it becomes a 
natural part of the management process.
Conclusion
A solid business plan is essential to raising the capital needed to start a business; lenders and 
investors demand it. “There may be no easier way for an entrepreneur to sabotage his or her 
request for capital than by failing to produce a comprehensive, well-researched, and, above all, 
credible business plan,” says one small business expert.70 Creating a successful business requires 
entrepreneurs to put the plan into action and then manage the company’s growth with a sound 
strategic plan.
The strategic planning process does not end with the nine steps outlined here; it is an ongo
t
-
ing procedure entrepreneurs must repeat. With each round, managers and employees gain experi-
ence, and the steps become easier. The planning process described here is designed to be simple. 
No small business should be burdened with an elaborate, detailed formal planning process it 
cannot easily use. Some planning processes require excessive amounts of time to operate and 
generate a sea of paperwork. Entrepreneurs need neither.
What does this strategic planning process lead to? It teaches business owners a degree of 
discipline that is important to business survival. It helps them learn about their businesses, their 
core competencies, their competitors, and, most important, their customers. Although strategic 
planning cannot guarantee success, it does dramatically increase a small company’s chances of 
survival in a hostile business environment.

Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Explain the benefits of an effective business 
plan.
● A business plan, which builds off of information 
from the feasibility analysis and business model, 
serves two essential functions. First and more 
important, it guides the company’s operations by 
charting its future course and devising a strategy for 
following it. The second function of the business 
plan is to attract lenders and investors. Applying
for loans or attempting to attract investors without 
a solid business plan rarely attracts needed capital. 
Rather, the best way to secure the necessary capital 
is to prepare a sound business plan.
● An effective business plan should pass these three
tests:
●Reality test. The external component of the real-
ity test revolves around proving that a market 
for the product or service really does exist. The 
internal component of the reality test focuses on 
the product or service itself.
●Competitive test. The external part of the com-
petitive test evaluates the company’s relative
position to its key competitors. The internal com-
petitive test focuses on the management team’s
ability to create a company that will gain an edge 
over existing rivals.
●Value test. To convince lenders and investors 
to put their money into the venture, a business 
plan must prove to them that it offers a high 
probability of repayment or an attractive rate 
of return.
2. Describe the elements of a solid business plan.
● Although a business plan should be unique and 
tailor-made to suit the particular needs of a small 
company, it should cover these basic elements:
executive summary, mission statement, company
history, business and industry profile, description of 
the company’s business strategy, profile of its prod-
ucts or services, statement explaining its marketing 
strategy, competitor analysis, owners’ and officers’ 
résumés, plan of operation, financial data, and loan 
or investment proposal.
3. Explain the “five Cs of credit” and why 
they are important to potential lenders 
and investors reviewing business plans.
● Small business owners need to be aware of the crite-
ria bankers use in evaluating the creditworthiness 
of loan applicants, known as the five Cs of credit: 
capital, capacity, collateral, character, and 
conditions.
● Capital—Lenders expect small businesses to have 
an equity base of investment by the owner(s) that 
will help support the venture during times of finan-
cial strain.
● Capacity—A synonym for capacity is cash flow. 
The bank must be convinced of the firm’s ability to 
meet its regular financial obligations and to repay 
the bank loan, and that takes cash.
● Collateral—Collateral includes any assets the owner 
pledges to the bank as security for repayment of 
the loan.
● Character—Before approving a loan to a small busi-
ness, the banker must be satisfied with the owner’s 
character.
● Conditions—The conditions–interest rates, the 
health of the nation’s economy, industry growth 
rates, etc.—surrounding a loan request also affect 
the owner’s chance of receiving funds.

CHAPTER 5 • CRAFTING A BUSINESS PLAN AND BUILDING A SOLID STRATEGIC PLAN
227
● Linking the purposeful action of strategic planning 
to an entrepreneur’s little ideas can produce results 
that shape the future.
Step 1. Develop a clear vision and translate it into 
a meaningful mission statement. Highly success-
ful entrepreneurs communicate their vision to 
those around them. The firm’s mission statement 
answers the first question of any venture: What 
business am I in? The mission statement sets the
tone for the entire company.
Step 2. Assess the company’s strengths and weak-
nesses. Strengths are positive internal factors; 
weaknesses are negative internal factors.
Step 3. Scan the environment for significant oppor-
tunities and threats facing the business. Oppor-
tunities are positive external options; threats are 
negative external forces.
Step 4. Identify the key factors for success in the 
business. In every business, key factors determine
the success of the firms in it, so they must be an
integral part of a company’s strategy. KSFs are re-
lationships between a controllable variable and 
a critical factor influencing the firm’s ability to 
compete in the market.
Step 5. Analyze the competition. Business owners
should know their competitors almost as well as 
they know their own. A competitive profile ma-
trix is a helpful tool for analyzing competitors’ 
strengths and weaknesses.
Step 6. Create company goals and objectives. Goals
are the broad, long-range attributes that the firm 
seeks to accomplish. Objectives are quantifiable 
and more precise; they should be specific, mea-
surable, assignable, realistic, timely, and written 
down. The process works best when managers 
and employees are actively involved.
Step 7. Formulate strategic options and select the 
appropriate strategies. A strategy is the game 
plan the firm plans to use to achieve its objec-
tives and mission. It must center on establishing
for the firm the KSFs identified earlier.
Step 8. Translate strategic plans into action plans. 
No strategic plan is complete until the owner 
puts it into action.
Step 9. Establish accurate controls. Actual perfor-
mance rarely, if ever, matches plans exactly.
Operating data from the business assembled into 
a comprehensive scorecard serves as an impor-
tant guidepost for determining how effective a
company’s strategy is. This information is espe-
cially helpful when plotting future strategies.
● The strategic planning process does not end with 
these nine steps; rather, it is an ongoing process that 
an entrepreneur will repeat.
4. Understand the keys to making an effective 
business plan presentation.
● Entrepreneurs who are informed and prepared when 
requesting a loan or investment favorably impress 
lenders and investors.
● Tips include: Demonstrate enthusiasm about the 
venture, but don’t be overemotional; “hook” inves-
tors quickly with an up-front explanation of the 
new venture, its opportunities, and the anticipated 
benefits to them; use visual aids; hit the highlights
of your venture; don’t get caught up in too much 
detail in early meetings with lenders and inves-
tors; avoid the use of technological terms that will 
likely be above most of the audience; rehearse your 
presentation before giving it; close by reinforcing 
the nature of the opportunity; and be prepared for 
questions.
5. Understand the importance of strategic 
management to a small business.
● Companies without clear strategies may achieve
some success in the short run, but as soon as a 
competitive threat arises, they often fail.
6. Explain why and how a small business must 
create a competitive advantage in the market.
● The goal of developing a strategic plan is to create 
for the small company a competitive advantage—
the combination of factors that sets the small busi-
ness apart from its competitors and gives it a unique
position in the market.
● Every small firm must establish a plan for creat-
ing a unique image in the minds of its potential 
customers.
● A company builds a competitive edge on its core 
competencies, which are a unique set of capabilities 
that a company develops in key operational areas, 
such as quality, service, innovation, team building, 
flexibility, responsiveness, and others, that allow it 
to vault past competitors. They are what the com-
pany does best and are the focal point of the strat-
egy. This step must identify target market segments 
and determine how to position the firm in those 
markets.
● Entrepreneurs must identify some way to differenti-
ate their companies from competitors.
7. Develop a strategic plan for a business using 
the nine steps in the strategic management 
process.
● Small businesses need a strategic planning process 
designed to suit their particular needs. It should 
be relatively short, be informal and not structured, 
encourage the participation of employees, and not 
begin with extensive objective setting.

CHAPTER 6 • FORMS OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND BUYING AN EXISTING BUSINESS
231
Once an entrepreneur makes the decision to launch a business, one of the first issues he or she faces
is choosing a form of ownership. Too often, entrepreneurs invest insufficient time and effort evaluat-
ing the impact that the various forms of ownership will have on them and on their businesses. They 
simply select a form of ownership by default or choose the form that appears to be most popular at 
the time. Choosing a form of ownership is a decision that has far-reaching effects for both the en-
trepreneur and the business. Although the decision is not irreversible, changing from one ownership 
form to another can be difficult, time consuming, complicated, and expensive. In many instances, 
switching an existing business from one form of ownership to another can trigger onerous tax con-
sequences for the owners. Therefore, it is important for entrepreneurs to get it right the first time.
There is no one “best” form of ownership. The form of ownership that is best for one entre-
preneur may not be suitable for another. Choosing the “right” form of ownership means that en-
trepreneurs must understand the characteristics of each form and how well those characteristics
match their business and personal circumstances. Only then can they make an informed decision
about a form of ownership. One attorney advises that entrepreneurs should choose a structure 
that offers them protection, while being only as complex as their business will really need.1 The 
following are some of the most important issues entrepreneurs should consider when they are 
evaluating the various forms of ownership:
Tax considerations. The amount of net income an entrepreneur expects the business to 
generate and the tax bill the owner must pay are important factors when choosing a form of 
ownership. The graduated tax rates that apply to each form of ownership, the government’s
constant tinkering with the tax code, and the year-to-year fluctuations in a company’s 
income make some forms of ownership more attractive than others.
Liability exposure. Certain forms of ownership offer business owners greater protection from 
personal liability that might result from financial problems, faulty products, lawsuits, and a 
host of other difficulties. Entrepreneurs must decide the extent to which they are willing to 
assume personal responsibility for their companies’ financial obligations. Two entrepreneurs 
who started a company with a portable climbing wall formed a limited liability company to 
limit their personal liability exposure because of the high-risk nature of their business.
Start-up and future capital requirements. Forms of ownership differ in their ability to
raise start-up capital. Depending on how much capital an entrepreneur needs and where he 
or she plans to get it, some forms are superior to others. In addition, as a business grows, so 
does its appetite for capital, and some forms of ownership make it easier to attract external 
growth capital than others.
Control. By choosing certain forms of ownership, an entrepreneur automatically gives up
some control over the company. Entrepreneurs must decide early on how much control 
they are willing to sacrifice in exchange for help from other people to build a successful 
business.
Managerial ability. Entrepreneurs must assess their skills and abilities to manage a busi-
ness effectively. If they lack ability or experience in key areas, they may need to choose a 
form of ownership that allows them to bring in other owners who can provide the necessary 
skills for the company to succeed.
Business goals. How big and how profitable an entrepreneur plans for the business to become 
influences the form of ownership chosen. Businesses often switch forms of ownership as they
grow, but moving from some formats to others can be extremely complex and expensive.
Management succession plans. When choosing a form of ownership, business owners 
must look ahead to the day when they will pass their companies on to the next generation 
or to a buyer. Some forms of ownership make this transition much easier than others.
Cost of formation. Some forms of ownership are much more costly and involved to create.
Entrepreneurs must weigh carefully the benefits and the costs of the particular form they choose.
When it comes to organizing their businesses, entrepreneurs have a wide choice of forms of 
ownership, including a sole proprietorship, a general partnership, a limited partnership, a cor-
poration, an S corporation, and a limited liability company. Figure 6.1 provides a breakdown of

these forms of ownership. Notice that sole proprietorships account for the greatest percentage of 
businesses, but corporations generate the largest portion of business sales. This chapter discusses 
the key features of these various forms of ownership, beginning with the three most basic forms 
(from simplest to most complex): the sole proprietorship, the partnership, and the corporation.
Eminem, known for being hard-core and controversial, is a top rap
artist. However, even with this persona, would he still sell out con-
certs if he performed under the name Marshall Bruce Mathers, III, 
his real name? Perhaps. However, Eminem’s stage name is an 
important part of his brand and his marketing success. Similarly,
choosing the right name for a company can enhance its success
by creating the proper image and telling customers what it does. 
A good business name should do the following:
•
Reinforce the company’s brand positioning. A good name 
communicates to potential customers something about the 
brand’s personality. For example, Twitter conjures up images 
of a flock of birds twittering in a tree or excitement over 
some event (“all atwitter”), both of which reinforce the 
company’s purpose: allowing users to share short bursts of 
information about their lives.
•
Resonate with the company’s target audience. PayPal puts 
a warm and friendly image on a product that simply aids 
financial transactions on the web. This image helps to build 
trust and confidence among the businesses and customers 
who make payments over the Internet.
•
Suggest to customers what your company does. The name 
Under Armour suggests that its sportswear products protect 
the person wearing them and conveys an image of being 
strong, which is very appealing to its target market of 
people who are active and physically fit.
•
Be clever and differentiate your company from its competi-
tors. For example, Tequila Mockingbird (Mexican restaurant), 
Sherlock Homes (locksmith), Planet of the Grapes (wine 
store), Florist Gump (flower shop), Curl Up & Dye (hair salon),
Character Eyes (optometrist) and Pita Pan (sandwich shop) 
are all examples of small business names that are clever
and memorable!
•
Be short, fun, attention getting, and memorable. Not only
is Google fun to say, but it is also quite memorable. Naming
experts say a great name has “emotional hang time,” a foot-
ball metaphor to describe a name that stays in your mind.
•
Be easy to spell and pronounce. This is especially important
for companies that operate solely online because their names 
often serve as the URLs for their Web sites. “Wikipedia”
works, but “Eefoof,” a failed video-sharing site, did not.
•
Grow with your business. When choosing a name, it is a 
good idea to keep an eye on the future. Many entrepre-
neurs select names for their businesses that can be limiting 
as their companies grow beyond their existing product lines, 
geographic areas, and target markets. Apple Computer 
moved beyond computers as its only product line with the 
introduction of its iPhone. With the announcement of the 
first iPhone, Steve Jobs also announced that Apple Com-
puter was changing its name to Apple. Revenues of iPhones 
and iPads both outpace revenues from Apple’s computers.
Choosing a memorable name can be one of the most fun—and 
most challenging—aspects of starting a business. It also is an 
extremely important task because it has long-term implications, is
the single most visible attribute of a company, and has the capac-
ity to either engage or repel customers. The business name is the 
first connection that many customers will have with a company,
and it should create an appropriate image in their minds. The
president of one small design firm specializing in branding says a 
company name is the cornerstone for branding. If done properly,
a company’s name portrays the business’s personality, stands out 
in a crowd, and sticks in the minds of consumers. Large companies
may spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in their search for just 
the right name. Although entrepreneurs don’t have the resources 
to enable them to spend that kind of money finding the ideal 
name, they can use the following process to come up with the 
perfect name for their businesses:
1. Decide on the image you want your company to project to
customers, suppliers, bankers, the press, the community,

and others. Do you want to create an air of sophistication, 
the suggestion of a bargain, a sense of adventure, the im-
plication of trustworthiness and dependability, or a spirit of 
fun and whimsy? The right name can go a long way toward
communicating the right image for a company.
2. Make a list of your competitors’ business names. The idea is 
not to borrow from their ideas but to try to come up with a
t
name that is unique. Do you notice any trends among com-
petitors’ names? What are the similarities? What are the 
differences?
3. Work with a group of the most creative people you know
to brainstorm potential names for your business. One en-
trepreneur called on 10 customers and 10 vendors to help 
him come up with a business name. Don’t worry about 
quality at this point; the goal is to generate a large quantity 
of names—at least 100 potential names, if possible. Having 
a dictionary, a thesaurus, a rhyming dictionary, and samples 
(or graphics) of your company’s products and services help 
to stimulate creativity. Consider names from unrelated 
sources that might be meaningful.
4. After allowing them to percolate for a few days, evaluate 
the names generated in the brainstorming session. Narrow 
the list of choices to 10 or so names with the greatest 
potential. Print each name in a large font on a single page 
and look at them. Which ones are visually appealing? Which 
ones lend themselves to being paired with a clever logo?
5. Reassemble your creative group, present each name you 
have printed, and discuss its merits and challenges. Having 
a designated person to record the group’s comments helps. 
The group may come to a consensus on a preferred name; if 
not, you can use a round-by-round voting process to move 
the group toward a consensus.
6. Conduct a search at the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office Web site (www.uspto.gov) to see whether the leading 
names on your list are already registered trademarks for 
existing businesses. Remember, however, that the same 
name can be registered as a trademark as long as the 
product, service, or company’s business does not overlap.
7. Conduct searches with domain name companies, such as 
GoDaddy.com, to see whether other businesses are using 
your desired business name as a domain name. When the 
founders of Emma, an e-mail marketing firm, searched for 
the availability of emma.com, they found that the name was 
already taken. They chose, instead, the domain myemma.
com, but kept the name Emma for the business. Several 
years later. this resulted in a legal dispute with the company 
that owned the emma.com domain name.
8. Conduct a Google or Safari search to see whether other 
businesses conducting business within your intended market 
have the same or very similar names.
9. Make your choice. Including input from others is useful when 
selecting a business name, but the final choice is yours.
10. Register your company name with the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office. Doing so gives you maximum protec-
tion from others using the name you worked so hard to
create. Diane Dassow thought she had the ideal name for
her personal history and memoir service business in 
Lombard, Illinois: Bridging Generations. However, Dassow 
soon discovered a funeral home in Pennsylvania that was 
using that name. She checked with the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office and learned that the funeral home had
already registered “Bridging Generations.” She changed the 
name of her company to Binding Legacies and registered it
as a trademark to protect her business.
Other helpful tips for creating the ideal business name include the 
following:
•
Look at your name from your potential customer’s perspec-
tive. Do customers need reassurance (Gentle Dentistry), or 
do they prefer a bit of humor (Barking Lot Dog Grooming)? 
Other options include using a name that conveys an im-
age to your customers that expresses your business strat-
egy, such as Tires Now, Quality Muffler, or Pay-Less Auto 
Detailing.
•
Decide the most appropriate quality of your business that 
you want to convey and incorporate it into your business 
name. Avoid sending a mixed or inappropriate message. 
Avoid business names that might leave potential customers
confused about what your business does. Remember that 
the company name will be displayed on all of your advertis-
ing, packaging, and printed materials.
There are millions of names in the marketplace. Coming up with
the one that is just right for your business can help greatly in cre-
ating a brand image for your business. Choosing a name that is
distinctive, memorable, and positive can go a long way toward
helping you achieve success in your business venture. Naming ex-
perts at Landor, an international branding firm, say a name “acts 
as the primary handle for a brand; it’s a recall and recognition 
device, it communicates desired attributes or specific benefits, 
and, through time and consistent use, it becomes a valuable asset
and intellectual property.” What’s in a name? Everything!

CHAPTER 6 • FORMS OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND BUYING AN EXISTING BUSINESS

Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships
The Sole Proprietorship
The simplest and most popular form of ownership remains the sole proprietorship. The sole 
proprietorship, as its name implies, is a business owned and managed by one individual. Sole
proprietorships make up about 72 percent of all businesses in the United States.
The Advantages of a Proprietorship
SIMPLE TO CREATE One of the most attractive features of a proprietorship is how fast and 
simple it is to begin. If an entrepreneur wants to operate a business under his or her own
name (e.g., Strossner’s Bakery), he or she simply obtains the necessary licenses from state,
county, and/or local governments and begins operation. Entrepreneurs who operate a business
under a trade name usually must file a certificate of trade name (or fictitious business name 
statement) with the secretary of state. Filing this statement notifies the public of the identity of 
the person behind the business. For most entrepreneurs, it is possible to start a proprietorship 
in a single day.
LEAST COSTLY FORM OF OWNERSHIP TO BEGIN In addition to being easy to begin, the 
proprietorship is generally the least expensive form of ownership to establish. There is no need 
to create and file legal documents that are recommended for partnerships and required for 
corporations. An entrepreneur simply goes to the city or county government, states the nature
of the business he or she will start, and purchases the necessary business licenses. Businesses 
with employees (including sole proprietorships) must obtain from the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) (at no charge) an employer identification number, a nine-digit number that serves as the 
equivalent of a business Social Security number. In addition, companies that have employees 
may be required to register with the state labor department that administers the unemployment 
insurance and the workers’ compensation programs. Businesses that sell goods or services must 
obtain a state sales tax license from the state tax office that allows them to collect sales tax from 
their customers and pass it on to the state department of revenue.
PROFIT INCENTIVE One major advantage of proprietorships is that once owners pay all of their 
companies’ expenses, they can keep the remaining profits (less taxes, of course). The profit 
incentive is a powerful one, and profits represent an excellent way of “keeping score” in the 
game of the business. Sole proprietors report the net income of their businesses on Schedule C 
of IRS Form 1040, and the amount is taxed at the entrepreneur’s personal tax rate. Because 
they are self-employed, sole proprietors’ income from their business activities also is subject to 
the self-employment tax, which currently stands at 15.3 percent (12.4% for Social Security and 
2.9% for Medicare program) of the proprietor’s income. A ceiling on the Social Security portion 
of the self-employment tax does apply.
TOTAL DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY Because the sole proprietor is in total control of operations, 
he or she can respond quickly to changes, which is an asset in a rapidly shifting market. The
freedom to set the company’s course of action is a major motivational force. For those who thrive 
on the challenge of seeking new opportunities in business, the freedom of fast, flexible decision 
making is vital. Many sole proprietors relish the feeling of control they have over their personal 
financial futures and the recognition they earn as the owners of their businesses.
NO SPECIAL LEGAL RESTRICTIONS The proprietorship is the least-regulated form of business
ownership. In a time when government regulation seems never ending, this feature has 
much merit.
EASY TO DISCONTINUE If an entrepreneur decides to discontinue operations, he or she can 
terminate the business quickly even though he or she will still be personally liable for any 
outstanding debts and obligations the business cannot pay.
The Disadvantages of a Proprietorship
Entrepreneurs considering the sole proprietorship as a form of ownership also must be aware of 
its disadvantages.

236
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
UNLIMITED PERSONAL LIABILITY Probably the greatest disadvantage of a sole proprietorship is 
the unlimited personal liability of the owner, meaning that the sole proprietor is personally
liable for all of the business’s debts. In a proprietorship, the owner is the business. He or she
owns all of the business’s assets, and if the business fails, creditors can force the sale of these
assets to cover its debts. If unpaid business debts remain, creditors can also force the sale of the 
proprietor’s personal assets to recover payment. In short, the 
l
company’s debts are the owner’s
debts. Laws vary from one state to another, but most states require creditors to leave the failed 
business owner a minimum amount of equity in a home, a car, and some personal items. The 
reality is that failure of a business can ruin a sole proprietor financially.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Larry Kim: WordStream Larry Kim 
launched WordStream in 2007 as a sole proprietorship. WordStream be-
gan as a keyword software tool developer for Web-based marketing. Kim said
that early on he treated the business as if it were his own personal bank account. 
After paying for business expenses, Kim kept the rest of the money he made for
his own personal expenses. He eventually realized that to grow his business, he
needed to leave some funds in the business and pay himself a lower salary. The 
investment back into the business began to pay off in growth. He was able to
add a partner and then begin to hire employees to take on the growing number 
of customers. WordStream has evolved from a sole proprietorship into a full-
service paid search marketing company with more than 80 employees.2 ■
LIMITED SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES A sole proprietor has total decision-making 
authority, but that does not mean that he or she has the range of skills that running 
a successful business requires. Each of us has areas in which our education,
training, and work experiences have taught us a great deal, yet there are other 
areas in which our decision-making ability is weak. Many business failures
occur because owners lack the skills, knowledge, and experience in areas that 
are vital to business success. Owners tend to push aside problems they don’t 
understand or don’t feel comfortable with in favor of those they can solve more
easily. Unfortunately, the problems they set aside seldom solve themselves. By
the time an owner decides to ask for help in addressing these problems, it may
be too late to save the company.
FEELINGS OF ISOLATION Running a business alone allows an entrepreneur maximum flexibility, 
but it also creates feelings of isolation; there is no one else to turn to for help when solving
problems or getting feedback on a new idea. Most sole proprietors admit that there are times 
when they feel the pressure of being alone and completely responsible for every major business
decision.
LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL If a business is to grow and expand, a sole proprietor often needs 
additional financial resources. However, many proprietors have already put all of the resources 
they have into their businesses and have used their personal assets as collateral to acquire loans,
making it difficult to borrow additional funds. A sole proprietorship is limited to whatever capital
the owner can contribute and whatever money he or she can borrow. In short, proprietors find it 
difficult to raise additional money and maintain sole ownership. Most banks and other lending 
institutions have well-defined formulas for determining borrowers’ eligibility. Unfortunately, 
many sole proprietors cannot meet those borrowing requirements, especially in the early days 
of business.
LACK OF CONTINUITY OF THE BUSINESS Lack of continuity is inherent in a sole proprietorship. 
If the proprietor dies, retires, or becomes incapacitated, the business automatically terminates. 
Unless a family member or employee can take over (which means that person is now a sole 
proprietor), the business will disappear. Because people look for secure employment and 
an opportunity for advancement, proprietorships often have trouble recruiting and retaining 
good employees. If no one is willing to step in to run the business in the founder’s absence, 
creditors can petition the courts to liquidate the assets of the dissolved business to pay 
outstanding debts.

237
Some entrepreneurs find that forming partnerships is one way to overcome the disadvantages 
of the sole proprietorship. For instance, when one person lacks specific managerial skills or has
insufficient access to needed capital, he or she can compensate for these weaknesses by forming
a partnership with someone with complementary management skills or money to invest. In fact, 
businesses that have multiple owners (not necessarily partners) are more likely to be larger and to 
survive longer than sole proprietorships.3
The Partnership
A partnership is an association of two or more people who co-own a business for the purpose 
of making a profit. In a partnership, the co-owners (partners) share the business’s assets, liabili-
ties, and profits according to the terms of a previously established partnership agreement (if one 
exists).

The law does not require a partnership agreement (also known as the articles of 
partnership), but it is wise to work with an attorney to develop one that spells out the 
exact status and responsibility of each partner. All too often, the parties think they know 
what they are agreeing to only to find later that no real meeting of the minds took place. 
A partnership agreement is a document that states in writing the terms under which 
the partners agree to operate the partnership and that protects each partner’s interest in 
the business. Every partnership should be based on a written agreement. A partnership 
agreement helps focus the entrepreneurial energy of business partners in a common di-
rection. A sound written agreement helps guide the partners through inevitable bumps 
in the road that every business partnership experiences from time to time.5

The Revised Uniform Partnership Act
The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) codifies the body of law dealing with partnerships 
in the United States. Under the RUPA, the three key elements of any partnership are common 
ownership interest in a business, agreement on how the business’s profits and losses will be 
shared, and the right to participate in managing the operation of the partnership. Under the act,
each partner has the right to do the following:
t
● Participate in the management and operations of the business
● Share in any profits the business might earn from operations
● Receive interest on loans made to the business
● Be compensated for expenses incurred in the name of the partnership
partnership
an association of two or 
more people who co-own a 
business for the purpose of 
making a profit.

● Receive his or her original capital contributions if the partnership terminates
● Have access to the business’s books and records
● Receive a formal accounting of the partnership’s business affairs
The RUPA also sets forth the partners’ general obligations. Each partner is obligated to do the 
d
following:
● Share in any losses sustained by the business
● Work for the partnership without salary
● Submit differences that may arise in the conduct of the business to majority vote or 
arbitration
● Give the other partners complete information about all business affairs
● Give a formal accounting of the partnership’s business affairs
● Live up to a fiduciary responsibility of the partnership and place the interest of the partner-
ship above his or her personal interests
Partnership Agreement
When no partnership agreement exists, the Revised Uniform Partnership Act governs a partner-
ship. If a partnership agreement contains gaps in its coverage, the act will fill them. However, its 
provisions may not be as favorable as a specific agreement hammered out among the partners. 
Creating a partnership agreement is not necessarily costly. In most cases, the partners can discuss 
their preferences for each of the provisions in advance. Once they have reached an agreement,
an attorney can draft the formal document. Bankers often want to see a copy of a partnership
agreement before lending money to a partnership. Perhaps the most important feature of the
partnership agreement is that it resolves potential sources of conflict that, if not addressed in 
advance, could later result in partnership battles and the dissolution of an otherwise success-
ful business. Spelling out details—especially sticky ones such as profit splits, contributions, 
workloads, decision-making authority, dispute resolution, dissolution, and others—in a written 
agreement at outset helps to avoid damaging tension in a partnership that could lead to a busi-
ness “divorce.” Business divorces, like marital ones, are almost always costly and unpleasant for 
everyone involved.
David Gage, a partnership mediator, suggests that partners also create a “partnership charter,” 
a document that serves as a guide for running the partnership and dealing with each other as 
business partners. Whereas a partnership agreement addresses the legal and business issues of 
running a business, a partnership charter covers the interpersonal aspects of the partners’ re-
lationships and serves as a helpful tool for managing the complexity of partnership relations.7
Even with a partnership charter and a partnership agreement, a partnership must have two more
essential elements above all others: mutual trust and respect. Any partnership missing these ele-
ments is destined to fail.
The Advantages of the Partnership
EASY TO ESTABLISH Like the proprietorship, the partnership is easy and inexpensive to establish. 
The owner must obtain the necessary business licenses and submit a minimal number of forms. 
In most states, partners must file a Certificate for Conducting Business as Partners if the business
is run under a trade name.
COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS In a sole proprietorship, the owner must wear lots of different hats, 
and not all of them will fit well. In successful partnerships, the parties’ skills and abilities usually
complement one another, strengthening the company’s managerial foundation. A common need 
for many entrepreneurs today is the need for partners with technical skills. Many new businesses
have strong Web-based components or are app-based business models. If an entrepreneur lacks 
the requisite technical skills, bringing in a “tech partner” who can handle the technical elements 
of the business may be necessary.

CHAPTER 6 • FORMS OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND BUYING AN EXISTING BUSINESS
239
DIVISION OF PROFITS There are no restrictions on how partners distribute the company’s profits 
as long as they are consistent with the partnership agreement and do not violate the rights of any 
partner. The partnership agreement should articulate each partner’s contribution to the business 
and his or her share of the profits. If the partners fail to create an agreement, the RUPA says the 
partners share equally in the partnership’s profits, even if their original capital contributions were 
unequal.
LARGER POOL OF CAPITAL The partnership form of ownership can significantly broaden the pool 
of capital available to a business. Each partner’s asset base enhances the business’s pool of capital
and improves its ability to borrow needed funds; together, partners’ personal assets provide a 
larger capital base and support greater borrowing capacity.
ABILITY TO ATTRACT LIMITED PARTNERS When partners share in owning, operating, and 
managing a business, they are general partners. General partners have unlimited liability for the 
partnership’s debts and usually take an active role in managing the business. Every partnership 
must have at least one general partner, although there is no limit on the number of general partners
a business can have.
Limited partners are financial investors in a partnership, cannot participate in the day-
to-day management of a company, and have limited liability for the partnership’s debts. If the 
business fails, they lose only what they have invested in it and no more. A limited partnership 
can attract investors by offering them limited liability and the potential to realize a substantial 
return on their investments if the business is successful. Many individuals find it very profit-
able to invest in high-potential small businesses but only if they avoid the disadvantages of 
unlimited liability while doing so. If limited partners are “materially and actively” engaged 
in a business (defined as spending more than 500 hours per year in the company) or if they 
hold themselves out as general partners, they will be treated as general partners and will lose
their limited liability protection. Two types of limited partners are silent partners and dormant 
partners. Silent partners are not active in a business but generally are known to be members
of the partnership. Dormant partners are neither active nor generally known to be associated 
with the business.
A limited partnership is composed of at least one general partner and at least one lim-
ited partner. There is no limit on the total number of limited partners. In a limited partnership, 
the general partner is treated, under the law, the same as in a general partnership. Limited
partners are treated as investors in the business venture, and they have limited liability for 
the partnership’s debts. They can lose only the amount they have invested in the business. 
Because of this advantage, limited partnerships own many professional sports teams, includ-
ing the Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, and Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball 
Association (NBA).
Forming a limited partnership requires its founders to file a Certificate of 
Limited Partnership with the secretary of state’s office. A limited partnership must 
include “limited partnership,” “L.P.,” or “LP” in its business name.
The limited partner does not have the right to engage actively in manag-
ing the business. In fact, limited partners who take an active part in managing 
the business (more than 500 hours per year) forfeit their limited liability status
and are treated just like general partners. Limited partners can, however, make 
management suggestions to the general partners, inspect the business, and make 
copies of business records. A limited partner is, of course, entitled to a share of 
the business’s profits as specified in the Certificate of Limited Partnership. The 
primary disadvantage of limited partnerships is the complexity and cost of estab-
lishing and maintaining them.

development company, to form a limited partnership called CryptPro. The partners, who are
working on the project outside of their full-time jobs, are developing a secure messaging 
system that allows two parties to exchange messages over a secure network. Users can send
a small number of secure messages for free, and heavier users will pay a monthly subscrip-
tion fee.8 ■
MINIMAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION Like the sole proprietorship, partnerships are not burdened
with excessive red tape.
FLEXIBILITY Although not as flexible as a sole proprietorship, a partnership can generally react 
quickly to changing market conditions because the partners can respond quickly and creatively 
to new opportunities. In large partnerships, however, getting partners’ approval can slow a 
company’s strategic actions. Unless the partnership agreement states otherwise, each partner has 
a single vote in the management of the company no matter how large his or her contribution to 
the partnership is.
TAXATION A partnership itself is not subject to federal taxation. It serves as a conduit for the 
profit or losses it earns or incurs; its net income or loss is passed through to the partners as 
personal income, and the partners pay income tax on their distributive shares at their individual 
tax rates. The partnership files an informational return, Form 1065, with the IRS that reports
its net income for the tax year and the percentages of the business that each partner owns. The
partnership provides each partner with a Schedule K-1 that shows his or her share of partnership’s 
net income (or loss). Partners must pay taxes on their respective shares of the partnership’s net 
income, even if none of that income actually is distributed to them. A partnership, like a sole 
proprietorship, avoids the “double-taxation” disadvantage associated with the corporate form of 
ownership.
The Disadvantages of the Partnership
Before entering into a partnership, every entrepreneur should double-check the decision to 
be sure that the prospective business partner will add value to the business. A partnership is
like a business marriage, and before entering into one, an entrepreneur should be aware of the 
disadvantages.
UNLIMITED LIABILITY OF AT LEAST ONE PARTNER At least one member of every partnership 
must be a general partner. The general partner has unlimited personal liability for any debts that 
remain after the partnerships assets are exhausted. In addition, general partners’ liability is joint 
and several, which means that creditors can hold all general partners equally responsible for the 
partnership’s debts or can collect the entire debt from just one partner.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: AmyLynn Keimach and Kenneth Tran: Border7
Studios AmyLynn Keimach and Kenneth Tran operate their Web-services firm, Border7 
Studios, based in Simi Valley, California, as a general partnership. Even though they recognize the
liability risks in choosing to operate as a partnership, Keimach and Tran, who started the company 
after they were laid off from their jobs without severance pay, say they cannot yet afford to form 
an S corporation, their desired form of ownership. Keimach says if one of Border7’s clients sues the 
company, a resulting judgment could conceivably take everything the two partners own.9 ■
CAPITAL ACCUMULATION Although the partnership form of ownership is superior to the 
proprietorship in its ability to attract capital, it is generally not as effective as the corporate form 
of ownership, which can raise capital by selling shares of ownership to outside investors.
DIFFICULTY IN DISPOSING OF PARTNERSHIP INTEREST Most partnership agreements restrict how 
partners can dispose of their shares of the business. Usually, an agreement requires a partner 
to sell his or her interest to the remaining partner(s). Even if the original agreement contains 
such a requirement and clearly delineates how the value of each partner’s ownership will be 
determined, there is no guarantee that the other partner(s) will have the financial resources to 
buy the seller’s interest. When the money is not available to purchase a partner’s interest, the 
other partner(s) may be forced to accept a new partner or dissolve the partnership, distribute 

CHAPTER 6 • FORMS OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND BUYING AN EXISTING BUSINESS
241
the remaining assets, or begin again. Under prior versions of the RUPA, when a partner 
withdrew from a partnership (an act called disassociation), the partnership automatically 
dissolved, requiring the remaining partners to form a new partnership. Current provisions of 
the RUPA, however, do not require dissolution and allow the remaining partners to continue 
to operate the business without the disassociated partner through a continuation agreement. 
The disassociated partner no longer has the authority to represent the business or to take part 
in managing it.
A similar problem arises when a partner dies. The deceased partner’s interest in the partner-
ship passes to his or her heirs, in which case the partnership is dissolved and the heirs receive the 
value of the deceased partner’s share of the business. However, the partnership agreement may 
provide for the partnership to continue to operate with the remaining partner(s) purchasing the 
deceased partner’s share of the business from his or her estate. To ensure that sufficient funds 
are available to purchase a deceased partner’s interest in the business, the partnership should 
purchase life insurance policies on all partners and use the proceeds to purchase the deceased 
partner’s share of the business for the surviving partner(s).
POTENTIAL FOR PERSONALITY AND AUTHORITY CONFLICTS Being in a partnership is much like 
being in a marriage. Making sure that partners’ work habits, goals, ethics, and general business 
philosophy are compatible is an important step in avoiding a nasty business divorce. Engaging 
in serious discussions with potential partners before launching a business together is a valuable
and revealing exercise. A better way to “test-drive” a potential partnership is to work with a 
prospective partner on a joint project to get a sense of how compatible your work styles, business 
philosophies, and personalities really are. That project might be a small business venture or 
working together to create a business plan for the proposed partnership. The idea is to work 
together before committing to a partnership to determine how compatible the potential partners’ 
values, goals, personalities, views, and ethics are.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: René Siegel and High
Tech Connect René Siegel and her partner launched their 
business, High Tech Connect, based on a need they discovered 
among their colleagues in Silicon Valley. Companies required the 
skills of specialized marketing consultants to work on specific pro-
jects, some of which might last for years. High Tech Connect built
a strong network of highly skilled, experienced freelancers to pro-
vide those marketing services. However, after a few years in busi-
ness, the partnership became quite contentious. The partners had 
established High Tech Connect as a 50/50 partnership with no exit 
clause in their agreement. The dissolution of the partnership in-
cluded many accounting and legal disputes, which led to litiga-
tion. Siegel eventually took full ownership of the business. She 
credits finding the right attorney, keeping employees focused on 
moving the business ahead, being able to rely on strong support 
from her family, and building a strong advisory team with getting 
through the transition to sole ownership. High Tech Connect now 
manages a network of more than 2,000 consultants who assist
clients with content development, editing, communications, 
speechwriting, public relations, and marketing through social me-
dia. Its consultants serve more than 500 clients, including compa-
nies such as IBM, Cisco Systems, Intuit, and McAfee.10 ■
No matter how compatible partners are, friction among them is inevitable. The key is to have 
a mechanism such as a partnership agreement and open lines of communication for managing 
conflict. The demise of many partnerships can be traced to interpersonal conflicts and the lack of 
a process to resolve those conflicts.
PARTNERS ARE BOUND BY THE LAW OF AGENCY Each partner is an agent for the business and
can legally bind the partnership and, hence, the other partners, to contracts—even without the 
remaining partners’ knowledge or consent. Because of this agency power, all partners must

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
exercise good faith and reasonable care when performing their responsibilities. For example, if a 
partner signs a three-year lease for a business jet, a move that only worsens the small company’s 
cash flow struggles, the partnership is legally bound by the agreement even though the remaining 
partners may not be in favor of the decision.
Some partnerships survive a lifetime, but others struggle because they suffer from many 
of the problems described here. Conflicts between or among partners can force an other-
wise thriving business to close. Too many partners never put into place a mutually agreed-on 
method of conflict resolution such as a partnership agreement. Without such a mechanism, dis-
agreements can escalate to the point where the partnership dissolves and the business ceases
to operate.
Structured properly, a partnership can be very successful and quite 
rewarding for its founders. Nick Friedman and Omar Soliman met
in the tenth grade and became best friends. In his senior year at
the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, Soliman enrolled 
in an entrepreneurship class where he created a business plan for
College Hunks Hauling Junk, the moving and junk-hauling com-
pany that he and Friedman operated during their summer breaks
from college. He submitted his plan to the Leigh Rothschild Entre-
preneurship Competition, where it won first prize and $10,000.
After graduating from Pomona College, Friedman accepted a job
at a Washington, D.C., consulting firm but quickly became dis-
enchanted with his corporate career. At age 22, he and Soliman
decided to launch College Hunks Hauling Junk and became the 
youngest franchisors in the United States.
Today their company, which recycles 50 percent of the mate-
rial they process, has grown into a $3.5 million junk removal busi-
ness with 35 franchisees and has been featured in the Inc. 500 list 
of fastest-growing small companies and on Shark Tank. Friedman
and Soliman are best friends, something that has strengthened 
their business partnership and made their company a success. 
However, that is not always the outcome when best friends go
into business together. Friedman and Soliman offer the following 
lessons for making a business partnership work:
•
Make certain that you have a common vision before 
you start. Friedman says the key to their successful partner-
ship is that they share a common vision and common val-
ues. Before they officially launched College Hunks Hauling 
Junk, each of them wrote separately about where they ex-
pected their business to be in five years. They were amazed 
at how strong their visions for the company matched with 
each other. While they have day-to-day disagreements, like 
any partnership, the two partners never disagree on the 
direction of the business nor the values that underpin how 
they conduct their business.
•
The ideal partner is one whose skills, experience, 
talents, and abilities complement yours rather than 
mirror them. While their company has grown, Friedman 
and Soliman have developed distinctive roles that support 
one another. Soliman is more of the strategic thinker, while 
Friedman is stronger with business operations and imple-
mentation of strategy.
•
Create a partnership agreement—always. No matter 
how strong a friendship is, partners should create a partner-
ship agreement. Discussing and then putting in writing how 
partners will handle sensitive issues, such as financing, daily 
decision making, deadlocks in decisions, compensation, and 
withdrawal from the partnership, not only helps resolve 
disputes down the road but also allows the partners to 
avoid disputes.
•
Create an advisory board. Friedman and Soliman are
equal owners of College Hunks Hauling Junk. What hap-
pens when they disagree on an important decision? In the 
early stages of the business, they simply “duked it out.” 
(Friedman laughingly concedes that actual punches have 
been involved on occasion.) Today, the business partners 
consult with the advisory board they created that includes 
professors, executives from large companies, and other en-
trepreneurs who can offer valuable insight.
In other cases, forming a partnership can be the beginning of 
an extended nightmare. Three entrepreneurs formed a partnership 
to sell male enhancement products but never created a partnership 
agreement. The partner who controlled the company’s finances
and operations distributed more than $11 million to himself from 
the partnership but less than $1 million to his partners. The two 
partners became suspicious and demanded a full accounting of
the partnership’s records. The managing partner refused, prompt-
ing the two partners to file an arbitration claim against him. Dur-
ing the arbitration hearing, the managing partner claimed that 
because there was no partnership agreement, no partnership ex-
isted. The two partners argued that the parties’ original intent was 
to create a partnership and that they should receive equal shares 
of the partnership’s profits. A panel of arbitrators agreed with
the two partners and ordered the managing partner to pay them 
$4.5 million. Of course, the business did not survive the dispute.

Limited Liability Partnerships
Many states now recognize limited liability partnerships (LLPs), in which all partners in a busi
l
-
ness are limited partners, giving them the advantage of limited liability for all of the partnership’s
debts. Most states restrict LLPs to certain types of professionals, such as attorneys, physicians,
dentists, and accountants. However, many states restrict the limited liability advantage of LLPs to 
the results of actions taken by other partners. For instance, if an LLP sells a defective product that 
injures a customer, the injured customer could sue the business and the partners as individuals. The
d
partners’ unlimited personal liability exposure means that their personal assets would be at risk.
Just as with any limited partnership, the partners must file a Certificate of Limited Partner-
ship in the state in which the partnership will conduct business, and the partnership must identify
itself as an LLP to those with whom it does business. In addition, like every partnership, an LLP 
does not pay taxes; its income is passed through to the limited partners, who pay taxes on their 
shares of the company’s income.
Corporations
The corporation is the most complex of the three major forms of business ownership. It is a sepa-
rate entity apart from its owners and may engage in business, make contracts, sue and be sued,
own property, and pay taxes. The Supreme Court has defined the corporation as “an artificial 
Avoiding ugly and costly business divorces that too often
bring an end to businesses requires an ongoing and active effort. 
Experts suggest that partners follow these guidelines to keep their 
partnerships going strong:
•
Ask yourself, “Do I really need a partner?” You should take 
on a partner only if doing so is essential to your company’s 
success. A potential partner should bring to the business 
skills, contacts, financing, knowledge, or something else you 
don’t have.
•
Take a close look at what you’re getting. How well do you 
really know your potential partner? One of the best ways to 
test your compatibility is to work on small projects together 
before you decide to go into business with one another.
Doing so allows you to judge how compatible your manage-
ment styles, business philosophies, and values are.
•
Invest in the relationship, not just the deal making. Partners 
must constantly work to strengthen their relationships. You 
cannot delegate or ignore this role; otherwise, the partner-
ship is destined to fail.
•
Respect your differences but expect to work out conflicts. 
When potential sources of conflict exist, address them 
immediately. Festering wounds seldom heal themselves.
•
Divide business responsibilities and duties according to each 
partner’s skills, interests, and abilities.
•
Be prepared to change. Be open to new opportunities and 
share with your partners what you see. Partnerships must 
evolve to survive.
•
Help your partners to succeed. Work hard to see that every 
partner plays a role in the business that affords him or her 
the opportunity to be successful.
You Be the Consultant (continued)
•
Make sure your partners are people you admire, respect, 
and enjoy being around.

three guidelines to those listed here.
2. Develop a list of the behaviors that are almost certain to 
destroy a partnership.
3. Suppose that two of your friends are about to launch a

being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of the law.”11 Because the life of 
the corporation is independent of its owners, the shareholders can sell their interests in the busi-
ness without affecting its continuation. Corporations are creations of the states. When a corpora-
tion is founded, it accepts the regulations and restrictions of the state in which it is incorporated 
and any other state in which it chooses to do business.
Because it is a separate legal entity, a corporation allows investors to limit their liability to 
the total amount of their investment in the business. In other words, creditors of the corporation 
cannot lay claim to shareholders’ personal assets to satisfy the company’s unpaid debts. The 
legal protection of personal assets from business creditors is of critical concern to many potential 
investors. John Gazzola, founder of Toyopolis, a company that sells toys, games, and collectibles
online, chose the corporate form of ownership because of his desire to limit his personal liability
and for “peace of mind.”12
This shield of limited liability may not be impenetrable, however. Because start-up compa-
nies are so risky, lenders and other creditors often require the founders of corporations to person-
ally guarantee loans made to the business. Experts estimate that 95 percent of small business
owners have to sign personal guarantees to get the debt financing they need. Banks, landlords, 
and vendors may all required personal guarantees from small business owners. By making these 
guarantees, owners are putting their personal assets at risk (just as in a proprietorship) despite 
choosing the corporate form of ownership.
The corporate form of ownership also does not protect its owners from being held person-
ally liable for fraudulent or illegal acts. Court decisions have extended the personal liability of 
the owners of small corporations beyond the financial guarantees that banks and other lenders 
require, “piercing the corporate veil” much more than ever before. Courts increasingly are hold-
ing entrepreneurs personally liable for environmental, pension, and legal claims against their cor-
porations. Courts will pierce the corporate veil and hold entrepreneurs liable for the company’s 
debts and obligations if the owners deliberately commit criminal or negligent acts when handling 
corporate business. Courts ignore the limited liability shield the corporate form of ownership 
provides when an entrepreneur:
● Uses corporate assets for personal reasons or commingles them with his or her personal 
assets
● Fails to act in a responsible manner and creates an unwarranted level of financial risk for 
the stockholders
● Makes financial misrepresentations, such as operating with more than one set of books
● Takes actions in the name of the corporation that were not authorized by the board of 
directors
Corporations have the power to raise large amounts of capital by selling shares of owner-
ship to outside investors, but many corporations have only a handful of shareholders. A closely 
held corporation has shares that are controlled by a relatively small number of people, of-f
ten family members, friends, or employees. Its stock is not traded on any stock exchange but 
instead is passed from one generation to the next. Most small corporations are closely held.
A publicly held corporation has a large number of shareholders, and its stock usually is traded 
on one of the large stock exchanges.
In general, a corporation must report annually its financial operations to its home state’s 
secretary of state. These financial reports become public record. If a corporation’s stock is sold in 
more than one state, the corporation must comply with federal regulations governing the sale of 
corporate securities. There are substantially more reporting requirements for a corporation than 
for the other forms of ownership.
Liability problems associated with piercing the corporate veil almost always originate from 
actions and decisions that fail to maintain the integrity of a corporation. The most common cause 
of these problems, especially in closely held corporations, is corporate owners and officers fail-
ing to keep their personal funds and assets separate from those of the corporation. Table 6.1 offers 
some useful suggestions for avoiding legal tangles in a corporation.
Unless a corporation fails to pay its taxes or is limited to a specific length of life by its char-
ter, it can continue indefinitely. The corporation’s existence does not depend on the fate of any

business, a corporation lives beyond the lives of those who gave it life. This perpetual life gives 
rise to another major advantage—transferable ownership. However, with most small businesses
the ability of any individual shareholder to sell shares is limited and must follow the processes
agreed on by the company founders when they incorporated.
The C Corporation
C corporations are the traditional form of incorporation. All large publically traded companies and
some small businesses are C corporations. C corporations are separate legal entities and there-
fore must pay taxes on their net income at the federal level, in most states, and to some local 
governments as well. Before stockholders receive a penny of its net income as dividends, a 
C corporation must pay taxes at the corporate tax rate, a graduated tax on corporate profits. Then, 
stockholders must pay taxes on the dividends they receive from these same profits at their 
k
individual
tax rates. Thus, a corporation’s profits are taxed twice. This double taxation is a distinct disadvan-
tage of the C corporation form of ownership. If a company plans to seek investment from venture
capital or other forms of private equity (sources of financing will be discussed in Chapter 13),
it should be established as a C corporation. A C corporation provides the appropriate structure for 
investments by corporations, an eventual acquisition, and a future public stock offering.
The S Corporation
In 1954, the IRS Code created the Subchapter S corporation, more commonly known as S corpo-
ration or S Corp. Unlike a C corporation, S corporations do not pay taxes on corporate income. 
Income earned by S corporations is passed through to the owners, just as it is in a sole proprietor-
ship and a partnership. The S corporation was established specifically for small, closely held
businesses to alleviate the owners from the double taxation that occurs with a C corporation. 
Table 6.2 shows a comparison of the tax bill for a small company organized as a C corporation 
and the tax liability of the same company organized as an S corporation (or a limited liability 
company, which shares the same tax treatment as an S corporation). An S corporation is a distinc-
tion that is made only for federal income tax purposes and is, in terms of all other legal charac-
teristics, no different from any other corporation.
TABLE 6.1 Avoiding Legal Tangles in a Corporation
Entrepreneurs should take these steps to avoid legal problems if they own a corporation:
● 
Identify the company as a corporation by using “Inc.” or “Corporation” in the business name. This alerts all who do business 
with a company that it is a corporation.
● 
File all reports and pay all necessary fees required by the state in a timely manner. Most states require corporations to file 
reports with the secretary of state on an annual basis. Failing to do so will jeopardize the validity of your corporation and will 
open the door for personal liability problems for its shareholders.
● 
Hold annual meetings to elect officers and directors. In a closely held corporation, the officers elected may be the shareholders, 
but that does not matter. Corporations formed by an individual are not required to hold meetings, but the sole shareholder must 
file a written consent form.
● 
Keep minutes of every meeting of the officers and directors, even if it takes place in the living room of the founders. It is a 
good idea to elect a secretary who is responsible for recording the minutes.
● 
Make sure that the corporation’s board of directors makes all major decisions. Problems arise in closely held corporations 
when one owner makes key decisions alone without consulting the elected board.
● 
Make it clear that the business is a corporation by having all officers sign contracts, loan agreements, purchase orders, 
and other legal documents in the corporation’s name rather than their own names. Failing to designate their status as
agents of the corporation can result in the officers being held personally liable for agreements they think they are signing on the 
corporation’s behalf.
● 
Keep corporate assets and the personal assets of the owners separate. Few things make courts more willing to hold 
shareholders personally liable for a corporation’s debts than commingling corporate and personal assets. In some closely held 
corporations, owners have been known to use corporate assets to pay their personal expenses (or vice versa) or to mix their 
personal funds with corporate funds into a single bank account. Protect the corporation’s identity by keeping it completely 
separate from the owner’s personal identities.

double taxation
a disadvantage of the cor-
porate form of ownership 
in which the corporation’s
profits are taxed twice, 
once at the corporate rate 
and again at the individual 
rate on the portion of pro-
fits distributed to share-
holders as dividends. 
S corporation
a corporation that retains 
the legal characteristics of 
a regular C corporation but 
has the advantage of being 
taxed as a partnership if it 
meets certain criteria.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
A corporation seeking S status must meet the following criteria:
● It must be a domestic corporation.
● It can only have only allowable shareholders, including individuals, certain trusts, and estates.
● It cannot include partnerships, corporations, or nonresident aliens as shareholders.
● It cannot have more than 100 shareholders.
● It can only issue one class of stock. However, S corporations can issue shares of stock with 
different voting rights.
● It cannot be an ineligible corporation, such as certain financial institutions, insurance com-
panies, and domestic international sales corporations.
If a corporation meets the criteria of an S corporation, its shareholders must elect to be 
treated as one. Shareholders may file for S corporation status at any time during the 12 months 
that precede the taxable year for which the election is to be effective. (The corporation must 
have been eligible for S status for the entire year.) To make the election of S status effective for 
the current tax year, entrepreneurs must file Form 2553 with the IRS within the first 75 days of 
the corporation’s fiscal year. All shareholders must consent to have the corporation treated as an 
l
S corporation. Jennifer Chu launched Chu Shu, a company that makes odor-absorbing liners for 
women’s shoes, after she was laid off from her investment banking job. Chu incorporated her 
business and intended to transform it into an S corporation but missed the filing deadline the first 
year, causing her to forgo several thousands of dollars in tax savings.13
An S corporation files an informational return (1120-S) with the IRS and provides its share-
holders with Schedule K-1, which reports their proportionate shares of the company’s profits. 
The shareholders report their portions of the S corporation’s earnings on their individual in-
come tax returns (Form 1040) and pay taxes on those profits at the individual tax rates (even 
if they never take the money out of the business). This tax treatment can cause problems for 
individual shareholders, however. If an S corporation earns a profit but managers choose to plow 
that income back into the business in the form of retained earnings to fuel its growth and ex-
pansion, shareholders still must pay taxes on their share of the company’s net income. In that 
TABLE 6.2 Tax Rate Comparison: C Corporation and S Corporation or Limited Liability Company
Entrepreneurs must consider the tax bills that their companies incur under the various forms of ownership. For example, S corporations 
do not pay taxes on their net income. Instead, that income passes through to the owners, who pay taxes on it at their individual tax 
rates. C corporations, on the other hand, pay a corporate tax on their net income. If the C corporation pays out some or all of its net 
f
income as dividends to shareholders, the dividends are taxed a second time at the shareholders’ individual tax rates. Therefore, the tax 
obligations for an owner of an S corporation may be considerably lower than that of a C corporation.
The following example illustrates the effect of these tax rate differentials. This somewhat simplified example assumes that a small 
company generates a net income of $500,000 and that all after-tax income is distributed to the owner.

case, shareholders will end up paying taxes on “phantom income” they never actually received. 
S corporations should always distribute enough cash to ensure that shareholders have the funds 
they need to pay taxes on the income that is passed through from the corporation. S corpora-
tions (and other pass through entities, such as partnerships) should follow the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 rule 
of thumb: distribute one-third of earnings to the shareholders to cover the taxes they will owe, 
retain one-third of earnings to fund its growth, and earmark the final one-third to pay down debt,
add to funding for its growth, or distribute to the owners as a return on their investment.
S corporations’ earnings are not subject to the self-employment tax that sole proprietors and 
general partners must pay; however, they are responsible for payroll taxes (for Social Security
and Medicare) on the wages and salaries the S corporation pays its employees. Therefore, owners 
of S corporations must be sure that the salaries they draw are reasonable; salaries that are too low 
or too high draw scrutiny from the IRS.
Before 1998, if an entrepreneur owned separate but affiliated companies, he or she had to 
maintain each one as a distinct S corporation with its own accounting records and tax return. 
Under current law, business owners can set up all of these affiliated companies as qualified
S corporation subsidiaries (“Q subs”) under the umbrella of a single company, each with its own 
separate legal identity, and still file a single tax return for the parent company. For entrepreneurs 
with several lines of businesses, this change means greatly simplified tax filing. Owners also can 
use losses from one subsidiary company to offset profits from another to minimize their tax bills.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Joseph Rotella: Spencer Organ Company Joseph 
Rotella is the owner of Spencer Organ Company, an organ maintenance and restoration 
business based in Waltham, Massachusetts. Spencer Organ Company is an S Corporation, and
Rotella is the only shareholder. Therefore, all of the company’s profits flow through to Rotella as
personal income. In a typical year, Spencer Organ Company’s profits are about $250,000. Rotella 
only draws a salary of about one half of that amount. Therefore, he not only owes income taxes 
on his salary, but also on the profits earned by his company.14 ■
The Limited Liability Company
The limited liability company (LLC), like an S corporation, offers its owners limited personal 
liability for the debts of the business, providing a significant advantage over sole proprietorships 
and partnerships. LLCs, however, are not subject to many of the restrictions currently imposed on 
S corporations and offer more flexibility than S corporations. For example, S corporations cannot 
have more than 100 shareholders, and none of them can be foreigners or corporations. S corporations 
are also limited to only one class of stock. LLCs eliminate those restrictions. Although an LLC 
can have just one owner, most have multiple owners (called “members”). LLCs offer their own-
ers limited liability without imposing any requirements on their characteristics or any ceiling on 
their numbers. LLC members can include non-U.S. citizens, partnerships, and corporations. Un-
like a limited partnership, which prohibits limited partners from participating in the day-to-day 
management of the business, an LLC does not restrict its members’ ability to become involved in 
managing the company. Today most entrepreneurs form LLCs for their new businesses.
In addition to offering its members the advantage of limited liability, LLCs also avoid the 
double taxation imposed on C corporations. Like an S corporation, an LLC does not pay income 
taxes; its income passes through to the members, who are responsible for paying income taxes 
on their shares of the LLC’s net income. Because they are not subject to the many restrictions
imposed on other forms of ownership, LLCs offer entrepreneurs another significant advantage:
flexibility. An LLC permits its members to divide income (and thus tax liability) as they see fit, 
including allocations that differ from their percentages of ownership. Like an S corporation,
the members’ shares of an LLC’s earnings are not subject to the self-employment tax. How-
ever, the managing member’s share of the LLC’s earnings is subject to the self-employment tax 
(15.3 percent) just as a sole proprietor’s or a general partner’s earned income is.
These advantages make the LLC an ideal form of ownership for many small companies 
across many industries—retail, wholesale, manufacturing, real estate, or service. Because it offers 
the tax advantage of a partnership, the legal protection of a corporation, and maximum operating
flexibility, the LLC is the fastest-growing form of business ownership. Mark Cuban, billionaire

owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, recently created an LLC, Radical Football LLC, a company 
whose mission is to fund the creation of a playoff system that will crown a real champion in major 
college football. The current collegiate football postseason consists of 35 bowl games in which 
many of the teams that compete are determined by computerized formulas. Cuban says he started 
the LLC so that the best teams will be the ones playing for the national championship.15
Creating an LLC is much like creating a corporation. Forming an LLC requires an entrepre-
neur to create two documents: the articles of organization (which must be filed with the secretary 
of state) and the operating agreement. The LLC’s articles of organization, similar to the corpora-
tion’s articles of incorporation, actually create the LLC by establishing its name and address, its 
method of management (board managed or member managed), its duration, and the names and 
addresses of each organizer. In most states, the company’s name must contain the words “limited 
liability company,” “limited company,” or the letters “L.L.C.” or “L.C.”
Once the members form an LLC, they must adopt an operating agreement. The operating 
agreement, similar to a corporation’s bylaws, outlines the provisions that govern the way the 
LLC will conduct business, such as members’ capital contributions to the LLC; members’ rights, 
roles, and responsibilities; the admission or withdrawal of members; distributions from the busi-
ness; and the way the LLC will be managed. To ensure that their LLCs are classified as a partner-
ship for tax purposes, entrepreneurs must draft the operating agreement carefully. The operating
agreement must create an LLC that has more characteristics of a partnership than of a corporation 
to maintain this favorable tax treatment.
Despite their universal appeal to entrepreneurs, LLCs suffer some disadvantages. They can 
be expensive to create, often costing between $1,500 and $5,000. Some states also impose annual
fees on LLCs. Unlike corporations, which can operate “for perpetuity,” LLCs have limited life 
spans. Entrepreneurs who want to provide attractive benefits to themselves and their employees 
will not find this form of ownership appealing because the cost of those benefits is not tax deduct-
ible in an LLC. Because there is no stock involved, this form of ownership also is not suitable for 
companies whose owners plan to raise money through an IPO or who want to use stock options 
or an ESOP as incentives for employees.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Anya Sapozhnikova: Lady Circus Anya Sapozhnikova is 
a partner in a business that is based on risk taking. Sapozhnikova is both a partner and a 
performer in Lady Circus of Brooklyn, New York, a circus that elevates traditional circus acts to
Y
new heights. Sapozhnikova says that because society expects more extreme experiences, a circus 
also must offer more extreme shows for its audiences. Circuses limit their business risk by requiring
performers to sign waivers of liability and to carry performers insurance. To limit her personal 
liability, Sapozhnikova and her partners organized Lady Circus as an LLC. To further protect from 
liability, she has her venue, the Sky Box, and her costuming and prop-making studio organized 
under a separate corporation. ■
Although an LLC may be ideally suited for an entrepreneur launching a new company, it 
may pose problems for business owners considering converting an existing business to an LLC.
Switching to an LLC from a general partnership, a limited partnership, or a sole proprietorship to
bring in new owners is usually not a problem. However, owners of corporations and S corpora-
tions could incur large tax obligations if they convert their companies to LLCs.
How to Create a Legal Business Entity
C corporations, S corporations, and LLCs can be costly and time consuming to establish and to 
maintain. The owners are giving birth to an artificial legal entity, and the gestation period can be 
prolonged, especially for a novice. Many entrepreneurs hire attorneys to handle the process, but 
in most states entrepreneurs can complete all of the required forms, most of which are online, 
themselves. However, entrepreneurs must exercise great caution when proceeding without the 
help of an attorney. Incorporating a business requires a variety of fees that are not applicable 
to proprietorships or partnerships. The average cost to create a legal business entity is around
$1,000, but, depending on the complexity of the organization and the type of entity the entrepre-
neur chooses for the business, fees can range from $500 to $5,000.

Most states allow entrepreneurs to establish a legal business entity without the assistance of 
an attorney. Some states even provide kits to help in the process. Many entrepreneurs use Web
sites such as MyCorporation, BizFilings, and LegalZoom to create legal business entities because 
they can incorporate for as little as $100.

James O’Leary and Ansar Khan are cofounders of Refulgent Software, located in
Amherst, New York. The company develops point-of-sale software, called Ambur, for restaurants.
Y
The partners relied on family support and bootstrapping to launch their new business. To keep 
their start-up costs down, O’Leary and Khan ran their business out of their apartment and set up
their company using LegalZoom. “I would advise folks using services like LegalZoom to do some 
additional research to make sure they are meeting all the requirements,” suggests Khan. “We
incorporated in August of 2010 and started selling our product in April of 2011. We had a few
hundred dollars in expenses in 2010 and no revenue. We did not realize that we still had to file a
tax return for the company for 2010. We did not end up doing that until late 2011 shortly after 
receiving a letter from the IRS stating that we owed them about $10,000 in fines for not filing a 
return in 2010. Luckily, we were able to talk to them and the fine was waived. Surprisingly, we 
figured out pretty much everything else on our own and avoided any other major mistakes!” 
Refulgent Software grew quickly. Within the first year, it grew to 400 customers and earned 
six-figure revenues.16 ■
Although it is cheaper for entrepreneurs to complete the process of creating a legal busi-
ness entity themselves, it is not always the best idea. In some states, the application process is 
complex, and the required forms are confusing. The price for filing incorrectly can be high. If an 
entrepreneur completes the process of forming a legal business entity improperly, it is generally 
invalid. In addition, if there are multiple founders, it is important to get assistance from an at-
torney to develop shareholder or member agreements. These agreements set the ground rules and 
expectations for shareholders or members, guide the process for major decisions, and mitigate 
any possible future shareholder or member disputes.
Once entrepreneurs decide to form a legal business entity, they must choose a state in which
to establish the entity. If the business will operate within a single state, it is most logical to form 
the business entity in that state. States differ—sometimes dramatically—in the requirements they 
place on the legal business entities they charter and how they treat the entities created within their 
borders. Some states, like Delaware, Vermont, and Nevada, offer low business formation fees, 
favorable laws concerning the sale of securities, low taxes, and minimal legal requirements; many 
Fortune 500 corporations are chartered in these states. However, for most entrepreneurs, creating 
the legal business entity in the state from which they intend to operate the business usually is best 
because they are not likely to reap any significant benefits by forming the business out of state.
Table 6.3 provides a summary of the key features of the major forms of ownership discussed 
in this chapter.
Buying an Existing Business
Rather than launch their own businesses, some entrepreneurs opt for a more direct route to busi-
ness ownership: They buy an existing business. Each circumstance of buying an existing business
is unique, but the process of evaluating a potential business acquisition is not. The due diligence
process that involves analyzing and evaluating an existing business for possible purchase is no 
less time consuming than developing a comprehensive business plan for a start-up. Done cor-
rectly, this due diligence process reveals both the negative and the positive aspects of an existing
business. Glossing over or skipping altogether the due diligence process is a mistake because a 
business that looks good on the surface may have serious flaws hidden at its core. Investigating
a business to discover its real condition and value requires time, dedication, and, as the name
implies, diligence, but the process is worthwhile because it can prevent an entrepreneur from 
purchasing a business destined for failure.
When considering purchasing a business, the first rule is, “Do not rush into a deal.” Taking 
shortcuts when investigating a potential business acquisition almost always leads to nasty—and

expensive—surprises. Prospective buyers must be sure they discover the answers to the following 
fundamental questions:
● Is the right type of business for sale in a market in which you want to operate?
● What experience do you have in this particular business and the industry in which it 
operates? How critical to your ultimate success is experience in the business?
● What is the company’s potential for success?
● What changes will you have to make—and how extensive will they be—to realize the 
business’s full potential?
● What price and payment method are reasonable for you and acceptable to the seller?
● Is the seller willing to finance part of the purchase price?
● Will the company generate sufficient cash to pay for itself and leave you with a suitable 
rate of return on your investment?
● Should you be starting a business and building it from the ground up rather than buying an 
existing one?
Figure 6.2 shows a profile of the four major categories of buyers and their characteristics that 
business brokers have identified.
The Advantages of Buying an Existing Business
A recent survey by Securian Financial Group shows that 60 percent of business owners intend to 
leave their companies within the next decade and that their most likely exit strategy is selling the
business to someone.17 Over the next decade, as these small business owners decide to retire and
sell, entrepreneurs looking to buy existing businesses will have ample opportunities to consider.
Those who purchase an existing business may reap the benefits discussed in the following sections.
SUCCESSFUL EXISTING BUSINESSES OFTEN CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL Purchasing a thriving 
business at a reasonable price increases the likelihood of success. Although buying an existing 
business brings with it certain risks, it tends to be less risky than starting a company from 
scratch. The previous management team already has established a customer base, built supplier 
relationships, and set up a business system. The customer base inherited in a business purchase

can carry an entrepreneur while he or she learns how to build on the company’s success. The
new owner’s objective is to make modifications that attract new customers without alienating 
the company’s existing customers.
SUPERIOR LOCATION When the location of the business is critical to its success (as is often the
case in retailing), purchasing a business that is already in the right place may be the best choice.
Opening in a second-choice location and hoping to draw customers usually proves fruitless.
EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS ARE IN PLACE An existing business already has experienced
employees who can help the new owner through the transition phase. Experienced employees 
enable a company to continue to earn money while a new owner learns the business. Many new 
owners find soliciting ideas from employees about methods for increasing sales or reducing 
costs to be valuable. In many cases, the previous owner may not have involved employees in this
fashion and never gained the advantages found in their wisdom and experience. Few people know 
a job better than the people who perform it every day.
In addition, an existing business has an established set of suppliers with a history of business 
dealings. Those vendors can continue to supply the business while the new owner investigates the
products and services of other suppliers.
INSTALLED EQUIPMENT WITH KNOWN PRODUCTION CAPACITY Acquiring and installing new 
equipment exerts a tremendous strain on a fledgling company’s financial resources. A buyer of 
an existing business can determine the condition of the plant and equipment and its capacity
before making the purchase. In many cases, entrepreneurs can purchase physical facilities and
equipment at prices significantly below their replacement costs.
INVENTORY IN PLACE The proper amount of inventory is essential to both controlling costs and
generating adequate sales volume. Carrying too little inventory means that a business will not 
have the quantity and variety of products to satisfy customer demand, and holding too much 
inventory ties up excessive capital unnecessarily, thereby increasing costs, reducing profitability, 
and putting a strain on cash flow. Owners of successful established businesses have learned the
proper balance between these extremes.
TRADE CREDIT IS ESTABLISHED Previous owners have established trade credit relationships with 
vendors that can benefit the new owner. The business’s proven track record gives the new owner 
leverage in negotiating favorable trade credit terms.
THE TURNKEY BUSINESS Starting a company can be a daunting, time-consuming task, and 
buying an existing business is one of the fastest pathways to entrepreneurship. When things go
well, purchasing an existing business saves the time and energy required to plan and launch a new
business. The buyer gets a business that is already generating cash and perhaps profits as well.
The day the entrepreneur takes over the ongoing business is the day revenues begin.
THE NEW OWNER CAN USE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PREVIOUS OWNER In many business sales,
the agreement calls for the seller to spend time with a new owner during the transition period, 
giving the new manager the time to become acclimated to the business and to learn about the 
keys to success. Previous owners also can be extremely helpful in unmasking the unwritten rules
of business in the area, critically important intangibles such as how to keep customers happy and
whom one can trust. Hiring the previous owner as a consultant for at least several months can be a
valuable investment and increase the probability that the business will continue to be successful.
EASIER ACCESS TO FINANCING Attracting financing to purchase an existing business often is
easier than finding the money to launch a company from scratch. Many existing businesses 
already have established relationships with lenders, which may open the door to financing 
through traditional sources such as banks.
HIGH VALUE Some existing businesses are real bargains. If the current owner must sell quickly, 
he or she may have set a bargain price for the company that is below its actual worth. Special 
skills or training that are required to operate the business limits the number of potential buyers;
therefore, the more specialized the business is, the greater the likelihood is that a buyer will find 
a bargain. If the owner wants a substantial down payment or the entire selling price in cash, there 
may be few qualified buyers, but those who do qualify may be able to negotiate a good deal.

Disadvantages of Buying an Existing Business
CASH REQUIREMENTS One of the most significant challenges to buying a business is acquiring
the necessary funds for the initial purchase price. The Small Business Administration advises 
that because the buyer of a company is purchasing the business concept, existing customers, the
company’s brands, and other existing elements of the business, the costs of acquiring an existing 
business are usually greater then starting one from scratch.18
THE BUSINESS IS LOSING MONEY A business may be for sale because it is struggling and 
the owner wants out. In these situations, a prospective buyer must be wary. Business owners 
sometimes attempt to disguise the facts and employ creative accounting techniques to make the 
company’s financial picture appear much brighter than it really is. Few business sellers honestly 
state “It’s losing money” as the reason for putting their companies up for sale. If there is one 
area of business where the maxim “let the buyer beware” still prevails, it is in the purchase
of an existing business. Any buyer unprepared to do a thorough analysis of a business may be 
stuck with a real money loser. One expert cautions that entrepreneurs who purchase troubled
companies in hopes of turning them around face an 85 percent failure rate.19
Although buying a money-losing business is risky, it is not necessarily taboo. If a company is
poorly managed or suffering from neglect, a new owner may be able to turn it around. However,
a prospective buyer who does not have well-defined plan for improving a struggling business 
should not consider buying it!
t
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Chuck and Alan Bush: Fuzzy’s Taco Shop Former res-
taurateur Chuck Bush was enjoying a meal at Fuzzy’s Taco Shop in Fort Worth, Texas, and 
observing the restaurant’s operating system in action. He saw the potential of the restaurant but
realized that it suffered from a sloppy operating system. There were no control systems in the 
business. When Bush asked how many shrimp would be served on a particular dish, each employee
gave a different answer. Chuck Bush and his father, Alan, an accountant, put together a group of
investors to buy the money-losing restaurant for $80,000. They also assumed $10,000 in liabilities 
and invested another $15,000 for working capital. Chuck became the on-site manager, and his 
first step was to close the restaurant for four days, power wash every surface, repaint and redeco-
rate the interior, and retrain the staff. He transcribed all of the recipes, which existed only in one 
cook’s head, and assembled them into a notebook to ensure consistency and cost control. Chuck 
Bush noted that the food at Fuzzy’s was good, which is what made him interested in buying the 
business. The business needed tightening of systems and better operation. The changes the Bushes 
made were successful, and the business became profitable the first year they owned it. They soon 
opened a second location in Fort Worth and began fielding inquiries about franchises. Today, 
78 Fuzzy’s operate across Texas and in 10 other states.20 ■
Like Fuzzy’s, unprofitable businesses often result from at least one of the following problems:
● High inventory levels
● Excessively high wage and salary expenses due to excess pay or inefficient use of 
personnel
● Excessively high compensation for the owner
● Inadequate accounts-receivable collection efforts
● Excessively high rental or lease rates
● High-priced maintenance costs or service contracts
● Poor location or too many locations for the business to support
● Inefficient equipment
● Intense competition from rivals
● Prices that are too low
● Low profit margins
● Losses due to employee theft, shoplifting, and fraud

254
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Like Chuck Bush, a potential buyer usually can trace the causes of a company’s lack of prof-f
itability by analyzing a company and its financial statements. The question is, Can the new owner 
take steps to resolve the problems and return the company to profitability?
PAYING FOR ILL WILL Just as sound business dealings can create goodwill, improper business 
behavior or unethical practices can create ill will. A business may look great on the surface, but 
customers, suppliers, creditors, or employees may have negative feelings about their dealings 
with it. Too many business buyers discover—after the sale—that they have inherited undisclosed 
credit problems, poor supplier relationships, soon-to-expire leases, lawsuits, mismanaged
customer relationships, building code violations, and other problems created by the previous 
owner. Vital business relationships may have begun to deteriorate, but their long-term effects 
may not yet be reflected in the company’s financial statements. Ill will can permeate a business
for years. The only way to avoid these problems is to investigate a prospective purchase target 
thoroughly before moving forward in the negotiation process.
EMPLOYEES INHERITED WITH THE BUSINESS MAY NOT BE SUITABLE Previous managers may 
have kept marginal employees because they were close friends or because they started with the 
company. A new owner, therefore, may have to make some very unpopular termination decisions. 
For this reason, employees often do not welcome a new owner because they feel threatened 
by change. Some employees may not be able to adapt to the new owner’s management style, 
and a culture clash may result. If the due diligence efforts reveal that existing employees are
a significant cause of the problems a business faces, the new owner will have no choice but to 
terminate them and hire new ones.
UNSATISFACTORY LOCATION What was once an ideal location may have become obsolete as 
market and demographic trends change. Large shopping malls, new competitors, or highway 
reroutings can spell disaster for small retail shops. Prospective buyers should always evaluate the
existing market in the area surrounding an existing business as well as its potential for expansion. 
Buyers must remember that they are buying the future of a business, not its past. If business 
success is closely linked to a good location, acquiring a business in a declining area or where 
demographic trends are moving downward is not a good idea. The value of the business can erode 
faster than the neighborhood surrounding it.
OBSOLETE OR INEFFICIENT EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES Potential buyers sometimes neglect to have
an expert evaluate a company’s facilities and equipment before they purchase it. Only later do they
discover that the equipment is obsolete and inefficient and that the business is suffering losses from 
excessively high operating costs. Modernizing equipment and facilities is seldom inexpensive.
THE CHALLENGE OF IMPLEMENTING CHANGE It is easier to plan for change than it is to implement 
it. Methods, policies, and procedures the previous owner used in a business may have established
precedents that a new owner finds difficult to modify. Employees and customers may resist 
changes to established procedures.
OBSOLETE INVENTORY Inventory is valuable only if it is salable. Smart buyers know better than 
to trust the inventory valuation on a firm’s balance sheet. Some of it may actually appreciate in 
value in periods of rapid inflation, but inventory is more likely to depreciate. A prospective buyer 
must judge inventory by its market value, not by its book value.
t
WORTHLESS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY BE WORTH LESS THAN FACE VALUE Like inventory, 
accounts receivable rarely are worth their face value. Prospective buyers should age a company’s 
accounts receivable (a breakdown of accounts 30, 60, 90, and 120 days old and beyond) to 
determine their collectability. The older the receivables are, the less likely they are to be collected, 
and, consequently, the lower their value. Generally, receivables that are more than 90 days old are
difficult, if not impossible, to collect.
THE BUSINESS MAY BE OVERPRICED At BizBuySell, an online marketplace for small companies 
that are for sale, the median asking price is $200,000, and the median actual sale price is $189,000.21
Unfortunately, many people purchase businesses at prices far in excess of their value, which can 
impair the companies’ ability to earn a profit and generate a positive cash flow. Some sellers attach 

CHAPTER 6 • FORMS OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND BUYING AN EXISTING BUSINESS
255
an emotionally driven value on their businesses. Others set the value based on what they need to
fund their retirement. If a buyer accurately values a business’s accounts receivable, inventories, and 
other assets, he or she will be in a better position to negotiate a price that will allow the business to be
profitable. Making payments on a business that is overpriced is a millstone around the new owner’s 
neck, making it difficult to keep the business afloat.
Although most buyers do not realize it, the price they pay for a company typically is not as 
crucial to its continued success as the terms on which they make the purchase. Of course, wise 
business buyers will try to negotiate a fair and reasonable price, but they are often equally inter-
ested in the more specific terms of the deal. For instance, how much cash they must pay out and 
when, how much of the price the seller is willing to finance and for how long, at what interest rate 
the deal is financed, and other such terms can make or break a deal. A buyer’s primary concern is 
making sure that the terms of the deal do not endanger the company’s future financial health and 
that they preserve the company’s cash flow.
The Steps in Acquiring a Business
Buying an existing business can be risky if approached haphazardly. Kevin Mulvaney, a senior 
lecturer of entrepreneurship at Babson College and CEO of a mergers and acquisitions consulting
firm, says 50 to 75 percent of all business sales that are initiated fall through.22 Figure 6.3 summa-
rizes the acquisition process. To avoid blowing a deal or making costly mistakes, an entrepreneur-
to-be should follow these seven steps:
1. Conduct a self-inventory, objectively analyzing skills, abilities, and personal interests to
determine the type(s) of business that offer the best fit.
2. Develop a list of the criteria that define the “ideal business” for you.
3. Prepare a list of potential candidates that meet your criteria.
4. Thoroughly investigate the potential acquisition targets that meet your criteria. This due 
diligence process involves practical steps, such as analyzing financial statements and 
making certain that the facilities are structurally sound. The goal is to minimize the pitfalls 
and problems that arise when buying any business.
5. Explore various financing options for buying the business.
6. Negotiate a reasonable deal with the existing owner.
7. Ensure a smooth transition of ownership.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Analyze Your Skills, Abilities, and Interests
The first step in buying a business is not searching out potential acquisition candidates. Every
t
entrepreneur who is considering buying a business should begin by conducting a self-audit to de-
termine the ideal business for him or her. The primary focus is to identify the type of business that 
you will be happiest and most successful owning. Consider, for example, the following questions:
● What business activities do you enjoy most? Least? Why?
● Which industries or markets offer the greatest potential for growth?
● Which industries interest you most? Least? Why?
● What kind of business would you enjoy running?
● What kinds of businesses do you want to avoid?
● What do you expect to get out of the business?
● How much time, energy, and money can you put into the business?
● What business skills and experience do you have? Which ones do you lack?
● How easily can you transfer your skills and experience to other types of businesses? 
In what kinds of businesses would that transfer be easiest?
● How much risk are you willing to take?
● Are you willing and able to turn around a struggling business?

1. Approach the candidate.  If a business is 
advertised for sale, the proper approach is 
through the channel defined in the ad.
Sometimes buyers will contact business 
brokers to help them locate potential target 
companies. If you have targeted a company in 
the “hidden market,” an introduction from a 
banker,r accountant, or lawyer often is the best 
approach. During this phase, the seller checks 
out the buyer’s qualifications, and the buyer 
begins to judge the quality of the company.
2. Sign a nondisclosure document.  If the 
buyer and the seller are satisfied with the 
results of their preliminary research, they are 
ready to begin serious negotiations.
Throughout the negotiation process, the seller 
expects the buyer to maintain strict 
confidentiality of all of the records, documents,
and information he or she receives during the 
investigation and negotiation process.The 
nondisclosure document is a legally binding 
contract that ensures the secrecy of the 
parties’ negotiations.
3. Sign a letter of intent. Before a buyer 
makes a legal offer to buy the company, he 
or she typically will ask the seller to sign a 
letter of intent. The letter of intent is a 
nonbinding document that says that the 
buyer and the seller have reached a sufficient 
“meeting of the minds” to justify the time 
and expense of negotiating a final 
agreement. The letter should state clearly 
that it is nonbinding, giving either party the 
right to walk away from the deal. It should 
also contain a clause calling for “good faith 
negotiations” between the parties.A typical 
letter of intent addresses terms such as price,
payment terms, categories of assets to be 
sold, and a deadline for closing the final deal.
4. Buyer’s due diligence. While 
negotiations are continuing, the buyer is busy 
studying the business and evaluating its 
strengths and weaknesses. In short, the 
buyer must “do his or her homework” to 
make sure that the business is a good value. 
5. Draft the purchase agreement. The 
purchase agreement spells out the parties’ 
final deal. It sets forth all of the details of 
the agreement and is the final product of the 
negotiation process.
6. Close the final deal.  Once the parties
have drafted the purchase agreement, all 
that remains to making the deal “official” is 
the closing. Both buyer and seller sign the 
necessary documents to make the sale final.
The buyer delivers the required money, and 
the seller turns the company over to the 
buyer.
7. Begin the transition.  For the buyer,r the 
real challenge now begins: making the 
transition to a successful business owner!

CHAPTER 6 • FORMS OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND BUYING AN EXISTING BUSINESS
257
● What size company do you want to buy?
● Is there a particular geographic location you desire?
Answering these and other questions beforehand allows you to develop a list of criteria a com-
pany must meet to become a purchase candidate. Addressing these issues early in the process will
also save a great deal of time, trouble, and confusion as you wade through a multitude of busi-
ness opportunities. The better you know yourself and your skills, competencies, and interests, the
more likely you will be to find and manage a successful business.
Develop a List of Criteria
Based on the answers to the self-inventory questions, the next step is to develop a list of criteria 
that a potential business acquisition must meet. Investigating every business that you find for sale
is a waste of time. The goal is to identify the characteristics of the “ideal business” for you so that 
you can focus on the most viable candidates as you wade through a multitude of business oppor-
tunities. These criteria will provide specific parameters against which you can evaluate potential
acquisition candidates.
Prepare a List of Potential Candidates
Once you know what your goals are for acquiring a business, you can begin your search. Do 
not limit yourself to only those businesses that are advertised as being “for sale.” In fact, the 
t
hidden market of companies that might be for sale but are not advertised as such is one of the 
richest sources of top-quality businesses. Many businesses that can be purchased are not publicly 
advertised but are available either through the owners themselves or through business brokers 
and other professionals. Although they maintain a low profile, these hidden businesses represent 
some of the most attractive purchase targets a prospective buyer may find.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Art and Alan McCraw: B. W. Burdette and Sons When 
brothers Art and Alan McCraw, two enterprising college graduates, returned to their
hometown, they approached the owners of B. W. Burdette and Sons, a local hardware store that 
had been founded by the current owners’ father 80 years earlier about buying the business. The
company was not listed for sale, but because the McCraws were familiar with the business, they 
knew that the current owners might be interested in selling. After several months of due dili-
gence and negotiations, the young entrepreneurs closed the deal. They have since expanded the 
business to include two more locations, expanded its market reach, and increased its profitability 
many times over. ■
How can you tap into this hidden market of potential acquisitions? Typical sources include 
the following:
● The Internet, where several sites such as Bizbuysell.com and Bizquest, include listings of 
business brokers and companies for sale
● Business brokers—to locate a broker near you, visit the Web site for the International 
Business Brokers Association at www.ibba.org
● Professionals who provide business services, such as bankers, accountants, attorneys, 
investment bankers, and others
● Industry contacts—suppliers, distributors, customers, insurance brokers, and others
● Networking—social and business contact with friends and relatives
● Knocking on the doors of businesses you would like to buy (even if they’re not advertised 
as being “for sale”)
● Trade associations
● Newspapers and trade journals listing businesses for sale
The more opportunities an entrepreneur has to find and evaluate potential acquisitions, the greater 
the likelihood of finding a match that meets his or her criteria.

Investigate and Evaluate Potential Companies: The Due Diligence Process
Finding the right company requires patience. Although some buyers find a company after only a 
few months of looking, the typical search takes much longer, sometimes as much as two or three 
years. Once you have a list of prospective candidates, it is time to do your homework. The next 
step is to investigate the candidates in more detail:
● What are the company’s strengths? Weaknesses?
● Is the company profitable? What is its overall financial condition?
● What is its cash flow cycle? How much cash will the company generate?
● Who are its major competitors?
● How large is the customer base? Is it growing or shrinking?
● Are the current employees suitable? Will they stay?
● What is the physical condition of the business, its equipment, and its inventory?
● What new skills must you learn to be able to manage this business successfully?
Determining the answers to these and other questions addressed in this chapter allow a prospec-
tive buyer to develop a list of the most attractive prospects and to prioritize them in descending 
order of attractiveness. This process also makes the task of valuing the business much easier. The
next section of this chapter explains the due diligence process in more detail.
Explore Financing Options
According to a recent survey of business brokers by BizBuySell, an online marketplace for busi-
nesses that are for sale, the principal cause of business sales failing to close is lack of available
financing.23 Although financing the purchase of an existing business usually is easier than financ-
ing a new one, some traditional lenders shy away from deals involving the purchase of an existing 
business, especially in the wake of the financial crisis. Those that are willing to finance business
purchases normally lend only a portion of the value of the assets, and buyers often find them-
selves searching for alternative sources of funds. Fortunately, most business buyers have access
to a ready source of financing: the seller. Seller financing often is more flexible, faster, and easier 
to obtain than loans from traditional lenders; in fact, it is currently an essential part of most deals.
BizBuySell estimates that in 90 percent of business sales, at least some portion of the financing
is provided by the seller. Once a seller finds a suitable buyer, he or she typically will agree to 
finance anywhere from 25 to 80 percent of the purchase price.
Usually, a deal is structured so that the buyer makes a sizable down payment to the seller, 
who then finances a note for the balance. The buyer makes regular principal and interest pay-
ments over 5 to 10 years—perhaps with a larger balloon payment at the end—until the note is 
paid off. The terms and conditions of the loan are a vital concern to both buyer and seller. They
cannot be so burdensome that they threaten the company’s continued existence; that is, the buyer 
must be able to make the payments to the seller out of the company’s cash flow. At the same time, 
the deal must give the seller the financial security he or she is seeking from the sale. Defining 
reasonable terms is the result of the negotiation process between the buyer and the seller.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jamey Hamm: Roots Café Jamey Hamm purchased Roots 
Café in Brooklyn, New York, from its previous owner. Hamm was eating a meal at Roots Café 
Y
and mentioned to the owner that he would like to own a business of his own some day. The owner 
also had purchased the restaurant but was never able to make it a profitable business. The owner
offered to sell Hamm Roots Café. Intrigued, Hamm studied the business, liked what he saw, and was
able to secure a loan from a family member. Because the owner was eager to sell Roots Café, Hamm 
was able to purchase the company’s assets for $8,000 less than the seller’s asking price.24 ■
Negotiate a Reasonable Deal with the Owner
The buyer must sit down with the seller to negotiate the actual selling price for the business and, 
more important, the terms of the deal. The final deal the buyer strikes depends, in large part, on 

CHAPTER 6 • FORMS OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND BUYING AN EXISTING BUSINESS
259
his or her negotiating skills. The first “rule” of negotiating a deal is to avoid confusing price with 
value. Value is what the business is actually worth; price is what the buyer agrees to pay. In a 
business sale, the party who is the better negotiator usually comes out on top. Buyers seek to do
the following:
● Get the business at the lowest possible price.
● Negotiate favorable payment terms, preferably over time.
● Get assurances that they are buying the business they think they are getting.
● Avoid putting the seller in a position to open a competing business.
● Minimize the amount of cash paid up front.
Sellers are looking to do the following:
● Get the highest price possible for the business.
● Sever all responsibility for the company’s liabilities.
● Avoid unreasonable contract terms that might limit his or her future opportunities.
● Maximize the cash they get from the deal.
● Minimize the tax burden from the sale.
● Make sure the buyer will be able to make all future payments.
One factor that makes the process of negotiating the purchase of a business challenging 
is that many business founders overestimate the value of their companies because of all of the 
“sweat equity” they have poured into their businesses over the years. Indeed, the second most 
common reason that business brokers say keeps business purchases from closing is the seller’s 
unwillingness to lower the asking price.25 One entrepreneur recalls a negotiation that he was 
involved in for the potential purchase of a rival’s business. The company had $4 million in sales
but had incurred losses of more than $1 million in the previous two years, owed more than 
$2.5 million in unpaid bills, and had no machinery that was less than 30 years old. Much to the 
prospective buyer’s amazement, the owner was asking $4 million for the business!26
Ensure a Smooth Transition
Once the parties strike a deal, the challenge of making a smooth transition immediately arises. No 
matter how well planned the sale is, there are always surprises. For instance, the new owner may 
have ideas for changing the business—sometimes radically—that cause a great deal of stress and
anxiety among employees and the previous owner. Charged with such emotion and uncertainty, 
the transition phase is always difficult and frustrating—and sometimes painful. To avoid a bumpy 
transition, a business buyer should do the following:
● Concentrate on communicating with employees. Business sales are fraught with uncer-
tainty and anxiety, and employees need reassurance.
● Be honest with employees. Avoid telling them only what they want to hear. Share with the 
employees your vision for the business in the hope of generating a heightened level of 
motivation and support.
● Listen to employees. They have firsthand knowledge of the business and its strengths and
weaknesses and usually can offer valuable suggestions for improving it.
● Consider asking the seller to serve as a consultant until the transition is complete. The 
previous owner can be a valuable resource, especially to an inexperienced buyer.
● Be ready to act if it becomes clear that there are problem employees. Most small business 
owners wait too long to terminate employees who are not working out. The previous owner 
may have avoided addressing these issues prior to selling the business.

260
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Negotiating the Deal
On the surface, the negotiation process appears to be strictly adversarial. Although each party 
may be trying to accomplish objectives that are at odds with those of the opposing party, the
negotiation process does not have to turn into a nasty battle of wits with overtones of “If you 
win, then I lose.” The negotiation process will go much more smoothly and much faster if both 
parties work to establish a cooperative relationship based on honesty and trust from the outset. 
A successful deal requires both parties to examine and articulate their respective positions while 
trying to understand the other party’s. Recognizing that neither of them will benefit without a 
deal, both parties must work to achieve their objectives while making certain concessions to keep 
the negotiations alive.
To avoid a stalled deal, a buyer should go into the negotiation with a list of objectives ranked 
in order of priority. Once he or she has developed a list of priorities, it is useful to develop what 
he or she perceives to be the seller’s list of priorities. That requires learning as much as possible 
about the seller. Knowing which terms are most important (and which are least important) to him 
or her and to the seller enables a buyer to make concessions without “giving away the farm” and 
without getting bogged down in “nitpicking,” which often leads to a stalemate. If, for instance, 
the seller insists on a term the buyer cannot agree to, he or she can explain why and then offer to 
give up something in exchange. The buyer also should identify the one concrete objective that 
sits at the top of that list, the one thing he or she absolutely must come away from the negotia-
tions with. The final stage of preparing for the actual negotiation is to study his or her list and the 
one that he or she has developed based on his or her perceptions of the seller to determine where 
the two mesh and where they conflict. The key to a successful negotiation is to use this analysis
to look for areas of mutual benefit and to use them as the foundation for the negotiation. The 
accompanying “Hands On: How To . . .” feature offers tips to help entrepreneurs become more 
effective negotiators.
LO7
Understand how the 
negotiation process works 
and identify the factors that 
affect it.
Buying or selling a business always involves a negotiation, and
so do many other business activities, whether an entrepreneur is
dealing with a bank, a customer, or a vendor. Roger Fisher and
William Ury, authors of Getting to Yes, say everyone negotiates 
several times every day. That’s why negotiating skills are among
the most important skills that entrepreneurs can learn. How can 
you become a more successful negotiator? The following advice 
will help.
1. Prepare. Good negotiators know that the formula for a 
successful negotiation is 90 percent preparation and 
10 percent bargaining. What you do—or don’t do—before
the actual negotiation ever begins is a primary determinant 
of how successful your negotiation will be. The key is to 
learn as much as possible about the party with whom you 
will be negotiating, the issues that are most important to 
him or her, and his or her likely positions on those issues. 
Leo Riley, president of his own training and consulting firm, 
says remembering people’s hobbies, families, interests,
religious affiliations, and so forth serves as ice breakers
and helps to avoid awkward mistakes.
Your preparation for a negotiation also should in-
clude a statement of the outcome you desire from the 
negotiation. John Patrick Nolan, a negotiation specialist, 
recommends that you develop a clear and precise set of 
goals when going into any negotiation. You also should 
write down what you think your counterpart’s goals from 
the negotiation are. This encourages you to look at the ne-
gotiation from a different perspective and can be a valuable 
and revealing exercise.
2. Remember the difference between a “position” and 
an “interest.” The outcome a person wants from a nego-
tiation is his or her position. What is much more important, 
however, is his or her interest, the reason behind the posi-
tion he or she hopes to achieve. Focusing strictly on their 
positions usually leads two parties into a win–lose mentality 
in a negotiation in which they try to pound one another 
into submission. When the parties involved in a negotiation 
focus on their interests rather than on their positions, how-
ever, they usually discover that there are several different
solutions that both will consider acceptable and reasonable.
The parable of the orange provides an excellent lesson 
on the difference between the two. Two parties each want 
an orange, but there is only one orange. After much intense 
negotiating, the two agree to cut the orange in half. As it 
turns out, however, one party wanted only the rind of the 
orange to make cookies, and the other party wanted

the orange to make orange juice. If the parties involved 
in the negotiation had focused on their interests and taken 
a problem-solving approach, both could have gotten exactly 
what they wanted from the negotiation!
3. Develop the right mindset. Inexperienced negotiators see 
a negotiation as a zero-sum, win–lose game. “If you win, 
then I lose.” Entrepreneurs who want or need to maintain 
ongoing relationships with the other party (e.g., buying a 
business from the company founder, whom you want to 
convince to stay on through a transition period to help you 
learn the business) must see negotiations in a different 
light. Their goal is to work toward a mutually benefi-
cial agreement that both parties consider to be fair and 
reasonable.
Successful negotiations almost always involve com-
promise on both sides, meaning that neither party gets
r
everything he or she wanted. Mike Staver, a negotiation 
consultant, says many times you may not be completely 
satisfied with the results of a negotiation. In other words, 
successful negotiators see a negotiation not just as deal 
making but also as problem solving.
4. Always leave yourself an escape hatch. In any negotia-
tion, you should be prepared to walk away without making 
a deal. Doing so, however, requires you to define what 
negotiation experts call a best alternative to a negotiated 
agreement (BATNA), which is the next best alternative to a 
negotiated outcome. You cannot determine whether a ne-
gotiated agreement is suitable unless you know what your 
alternatives are, and one alternative (although not always 
the best one) is to walk away from the negotiation without 
an agreement—your BATNA. Although you may never need 
to use your BATNA, it is good to know you have it in your 
“back pocket” to give you confidence and help you remain 
calm throughout the negotiating process.
Having a BATNA increases your power in a negotia-
tion, but you should use that power judiciously. Do not use 
your BATNA as a threat to coerce an agreement. In addition, 
don’t kill the deal just because you can. Instead, use your 
BATNA as the baseline against which you measure your 
negotiated alternatives.
5. Keep your emotions in check. Negotiations can become 
emotionally charged, especially if those involved allow their 
egos to enter into the process. It is always best to abide by 
the golden rule of negotiating: treat others the way you 
want to be treated in the negotiation. Be fair but firm. If the 
other party forgets the golden rule of negotiating, remem-
ber that you can always walk away from the negotiation 
and fall back on your BATNA.
6. Don’t fall into the “rules” trap. Successful negotiations 
involve give-and-take by both parties. There are no hard and
fast rules that prohibit either party from making changes in 
contracts or agreements throughout the negotiating process. 
Nothing is settled until both parties sign the final docu-
ments. Until then, the parties can change anything. The 
goal is not to win specific points in the negotiating process; 
the goal is to reach an agreement viewed as fair and reason-
able to both sides of the negotiation.
7. Sometimes it’s best to remain silent. A common mistake 
many people make in the negotiation process is talking too 
much. Not only does remaining silent allow you to listen to 
the other party, but it also encourages the other party to 
make the first offer. Some people are disconcerted by pro-
longed periods of silence and begin talking, only to erode 
the strength of their negotiation base.

Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Explain the advantages and disadvantages 
of a sole proprietorship and a partnership.
● A sole proprietorship is a business owned and man-
aged by one individual and is the most popular form 
of ownership.
● Sole proprietorships offer these advantages: They 
are simple to create, they are the least costly form to 
begin, the owner has total decision-making author-
ity, there are no special legal restrictions, and they 
are easy to discontinue.
● Sole proprietorships also suffer from these disad-
vantages: unlimited personal liability of the owner,
limited managerial skills and capabilities, limited 
access to capital, and lack of continuity.
● A partnership is an association of two or more 
people who co-own a business for the purpose of 
making a profit. Partnerships offer these advan-
tages: ease of establishing, complementary skills 
of partners, division of profits, larger pool of 
capital available, ability to attract limited partners, 
little government regulation, flexibility, and tax 
advantages.
● Partnerships suffer from these disadvantages:
unlimited liability of at least one partner, difficulty 
in disposing of partnership, lack of continuity,

continue to be successful, the business may already
have the best location, employees and suppliers are 
already established, equipment is installed and its 
productive capacity known, inventory is in place 
and trade credit established, the owner hits the 
ground running, the buyer can use the expertise 
of the previous owner, and the business may be a 
bargain.
● The disadvantages of buying an existing business
include the following: an existing business may
be for sale because it is deteriorating, the previ-
ous owner may have created ill will, employees 
inherited with the business may not be suitable, 
its location may have become unsuitable, equip-
ment and facilities may be obsolete, change and 
innovation are hard to implement, inventory may 
be outdated, accounts receivable may be worth 
less than face value, and the business may be
overpriced.
6. Define the steps involved in the right way
t
to buy a business.
● Buying a business can be a treacherous experience 
unless the buyer is well prepared.
● The right way to buy a business is to analyze your 
skills, abilities, and interests to determine the ideal 
business for you; prepare a list of potential candi-
dates, including those that might be in the “hidden 
market”; investigate and rank candidate businesses
and evaluate the best one; explore financing options 
before you actually need the money; and ensure a 
smooth transition.
7. Understand how the negotiation process
works and identify the factors that affect it.
● The first rule of negotiating is to never confuse price 
with value.
● In a business sale, the party who is the better nego-
tiator usually comes out on top. Before beginning 
negotiations, a buyer should identify the factors that 
are affecting the negotiations and then develop a 
negotiating strategy.
● The best deals are the result of a cooperative rela-
tionship between the parties based on trust.
potential for personality and authority conflicts, and 
partners bound by the law of agency.
2. Describe the similarities and differences of the 
C corporation and the S corporation.
● Both C corporations and S corporations are separate 
legal entities. To form a corporation, an entrepre-
neur must file the articles of incorporation with the 
state in which the company will incorporate.
● Both types of corporations offer these advantages:
limited liability of stockholders, ability to attract 
capital, ability to continue indefinitely, and transfer-
able ownership.
● C corporations suffer from these disadvantages: 
double taxation, potential for diminished managerial 
incentives, legal requirements and regulatory red 
tape, and potential loss of control by the founder(s).
● S corporations are pass-through entities and do not 
have taxation of profits at the corporate level.
3. Understand the characteristics of the limited 
liability company.
● An LLC is not a corporation but offers the advan-
tage of limited liability to its owners.
● An LLC is a cross between a partnership and a 
corporation yet operates without the restrictions 
imposed on an S corporation. To create an LLC, an 
entrepreneur must file the articles of organization 
with the secretary of state and create an operating 
agreement.
4. Explain the process of creating a legal entity 
for a business.
● C corporations, S corporations, and LLCs can be costly 
and time consuming to establish and to maintain.
● Many entrepreneurs hire attorneys to handle the 
process, but in most states entrepreneurs can com-
plete all of the required forms, most of which are 
online, themselves.
5. Understand the advantages and disadvantages 
of buying an existing business.
● The advantages of buying an existing business

CHAPTER 7 • FRANCHISING AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
265
Samantha Goldsmith learned about business from her father, Harvey, 
who owned a company that rented equipment for businesses to use 
when taking inventory. “I’ve wanted to be like my Dad since I was 
five years old,” she says. Goldsmith began working part-time at a Bed 
Bath and Beyond store on her native Long Island, New York, when 
she was 16 years old and was promoted twice in less than two years.
When she was just 21 years old, Goldsmith attended a franchise expo
with her father and was intrigued by the “delicious and healthy” 
product line of the Red Mango all-natural yogurt and smoothie fran-
chise. She applied for a franchise and, with her father’s help, be-
came the youngest franchisee in the Red Mango chain. Now only 25, 
Goldsmith owns 10 Red Mango franchises, which makes her the larg-
est multi-unit operator in the system. “I want my stores to be as profit-
able as they can be, and I want people to see how clean and well-run 
the stores are,” she says. Goldsmith works closely with her husband,
Tim Gatto, who serves as Goldsmith Companies’ chief operations of-f
ficer, but her father remains her greatest fan. “He tells me how proud
he is all the time,” she says. Multi-Unit Franchisee magazine recently 
honored Goldsmith by naming her the winner of one of its prestigious 
MVP Awards.1
Like Goldsmith’s business, most franchised outlets are small, but as a whole, they have
a significant impact on the U.S. economy. In the United States alone, about 3,000 franchisors 
operate more than 770,000 franchise outlets (see Figure 7.1), and more are opening constantly 
both in the United States and around the world. Franchises generate more than $800 billion in 
annual sales, account for 4.1 percent of the U.S. GDP, and employ nearly 8.1 million workers in 
the United States in more than 300 industries.2 Much of the popularity of franchising stems from 
its ability to offer those who lack business experience the chance to own and operate a business 
with a high probability of success. This booming industry has moved far beyond the traditional 
boundaries of fast food and hotels into fields as diverse as mosquito spraying, used clothing,
mold detection, and pet resorts. In 2008, Daniel Rella, Chris Couri, and Tom Darrow launched 
a part-time parking lot striping business, We Do Lines, in Richfield, Connecticut, that quickly 
became a full-time business. They soon discovered that the parking lot striping business was a
$1 billion a year industry with no national players and in 2009 began selling franchises. Currently 
with 10 franchisees, the entrepreneurs have plans to expand to more than 100 franchises within 
five years. “We’ll teach you everything you need to know,” says Rella.3 Figure 7.2 provides a
breakdown of the franchise market by industry.
Franchising also has a significant impact on the global economy. U.S. franchisors are ex-
panding globally to reach their growth targets. A survey by the International Franchise Associa-
tion reports that 61 percent of its members operate in international markets and that 74 percent 
of international franchisors plan to accelerate the growth of their global franchised units in the 
near future.4 Countries that are attracting the greatest attention for international expansion among

franchisors include Brazil, India, China, and nations in the Middle East and North Africa region. 
With their fast-growing populations, rising levels of disposable income, spreading urbanization, 
and keen interest in American brands, these nations offer prime growth opportunities for U.S.
franchisors.
In franchising, semi-independent business owners (franchisees) pay fees and royalties to a
parent company (franchisor) in return for the right (license) to become identified with its trade-
mark, to sell its products or services, and often to use its business format and system. Franchisees
do not establish their own autonomous businesses; instead, they buy a “success package” from 
the franchisor, who shows them how to use it. Franchisees, unlike independent business owners,
don’t have the freedom to change the way they run their businesses—for example, shifting adver-
tising strategies or adjusting product lines—but they do have access to a formula for success that 
the franchisor has worked out. “As a franchisee, your role is to operate,” says franchising expert 
Mark Spriggs. “You have to be willing to follow the rules.”5 Fundamentally, when franchisees 
buy franchises, they are purchasing a successful business model. The franchisor provides the 
business model and the expertise to make it work; the franchisee brings the investment, spirit, 
and drive necessary to implement the model successfully. Many successful franchisors claim that 
neglecting to follow the formula is one of the chief reasons some franchisees fail. “If you are 
overly entrepreneurial and you want to invent you own wheel, or if you are not comfortable with 
following a system, don’t go down [the franchise] path,” says Don DeBolt, former head of the 
International Franchise Association.6
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Schlachter’s Maaco Auto Painting and Bodyworks
Anita Schlachter, co-owner of a highly successful Maaco (automotive services) franchise
with her husband and her son, is convinced that the system the franchisor taught them is the
key to their company’s progress and growth to date. The Schlachters follow the franchisor’s 
plan, using it as a road map to success. Schlacter says franchisees who listen to their franchisors 
and follow their policies and procedures are likely to be successful. Entrepreneurs who believe
they know more about the business than the franchisor should avoid franchising and launch
independent businesses.7 ■
Franchising is built on an ongoing relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee (see 
Figure 7.3). The franchisor provides valuable services, such as a proven business system, training
and support, name recognition, and many other forms of assistance; in return, the franchisee pays 
an initial franchise fee as well as an ongoing percentage of his or her outlet’s sales to the fran-
chisor as a royalty and agrees to operate the outlet according to the franchisor’s terms. Because 
franchisors develop the business systems that their franchisees use and direct their distribution

267
methods, they maintain substantial control over their franchisees. Yet this standardization lies at 
the core of franchising’s success as a method of distribution.
Types of Franchising
Many experts trace the roots of modern franchising to the 1850s when Isaac Singer, founder of 
the Singer Sewing Machine Company, decided to expand his young business by granting licenses 
to other businesses that would sell his company’s sewing machines in specific geographic areas.8
Three basic types of franchises operate in almost every industry: trade-name franchising, product 
distribution franchising, and pure franchising. Trade-name franchising involves a brand name, 
such as True Value Hardware or Western Auto. Here, the franchisee purchases the right to use the 
franchisor’s trade name without distributing particular products exclusively under the franchi-
sor’s name. Product distribution franchising involves a franchisor licensing a franchisee to sell 
specific products under the franchisor’s brand name and trademark through a selective, limited 
distribution network. This system is commonly used to market automobiles (Chevrolet, Lexus, 
Ford), gasoline products (ExxonMobil, Sunoco, Texaco), soft drinks (Pepsi Cola, Coca-Cola), 
appliances, cosmetics, and other products. These two methods of franchising allow franchisees 
to affiliate with the parent company’s identity.
Pure franchising (also called comprehensive or business format franchising) involves pro-
viding the franchisee with a complete business format, including a license for a trade name, the 
products or services to be sold, the store layout, the methods of operation, a marketing plan, a 
quality control process, a two-way communications system, and the necessary business support 
services. In short, the franchisee purchases the right to use all of the elements of a fully integrated 
trade-name

business operation. Business format franchising is the most common and the fastest growing of 
the three types of franchising and accounts for nearly 95 percent of all franchised outlets.9 It is 
common among quick service restaurants, hotels, business service firms, car rental agencies,
educational institutions, beauty aid retailers, and many other types of businesses.
The franchise industry is not immune to cyclical swings in the economy. Recessions, high
unemployment, declining business and consumer confidence, and tight credit conditions lead to 
failures of both independent and franchised businesses. Figure 7.4 shows the International Fran-
chise Association’s Franchise Business Index, a composite measure of the economic health of the 
franchise industry that includes six different indicators (January 2000 = 100).
The Benefits of Buying a Franchise
A franchisee gets the opportunity to own a small business relatively quickly and, because of the 
identification with an established product and brand name, often reaches the break-even point 
faster than an independent business would. Still, most new franchise outlets don’t break even for 
at least 6 to 18 months.
Franchisees also benefit from the franchisor’s business experience. In fact, experience is 
the essence of what a franchisee is buying from a franchisor. As you learned in Chapter 1, many
entrepreneurs go into business by themselves and make costly mistakes. Given the thin margin
for error in the typical start-up, a new business owner cannot afford to make many mistakes. In 
a franchising arrangement, the franchisor already has worked out the kinks in the system by trial

and error, and franchisees benefit from that experience. A franchisor has climbed up the learning
curve and shares with franchisees the secrets of success it has discovered in the industry. “A great 
franchisor has developed all of the tools that you need to start a business,” says Lori Kiser-Block,
president of a franchise consulting firm. “They’ve developed the marketing system, the train-
ing and operation system, the brand, and the marketing tools you need. They’ve made all of the 
mistakes for you.”10
For many first-time entrepreneurs, access to a business model with a proven track record is 
the safest way to own a business. Still, every potential franchisee must consider one important 
question: “What can a franchise do for me that I cannot do for myself?” The answer to this ques-
tion depends on one’s particular situation and requires a systematic evaluation of a franchise 
opportunity. After careful deliberation, one person may conclude that a franchise offers nothing
that he or she could not do independently, and another may decide that a franchise is the key to 
success as a business owner. Franchisees often cite the advantages discussed in the following 
sections.
A Business System
One of the biggest benefits of buying a franchise is gaining access to a business system that has 
a proven record of success. In many cases, the business system that a franchisor provides allows
franchisees to get their businesses up and running faster than if they had tried to launch them on 
their own. Fran Lubin, who left the corporate office of Goddard School, an early education fran-
chise, to become a Goddard franchisee, recalls, “I understood that the business was mine to run. 
Goddard was there to help me and to provide multiple resources and a proven system, but it was 
up to me to take all of those things and to make my business successful.”11
Using the franchisor’s business system as a guide, franchisees can be successful even though
they may have little or no experience in the industry. According to Jerry Perch, director of fran-
chise development for Express Oil Change, the franchisor looks first for candidates who are 
financially qualified. The company does not require franchisees to have experience as mechan-
ics; instead, the ideal candidate is someone with business skills whom the franchisor can train to 
operate a million-dollar business successfully.12
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Spencer Smith: Aaron’s 
and Big O Tires Spencer Smith started “working” in his 
father’s tire store every day after he got out of kindergarten, so it 
was only natural that, as an adult, he would purchase a Big O Tires
franchise. Smith, who now owns two Big O Tire franchises and 
39 Aaron’s franchises in eight western states that generate
$49 million in annual sales, emphasizes the importance of follow-
ing the franchisor’s business system in his operation. “When you 
buy into a franchise, you’re buying into doing business that par-
ticular way,” says Smith. “If you have to be a maverick and reinvent
the wheel all the time, both you and the franchisor will be frus-
trated. When I look at a potential franchise, I ask myself: ‘Am I fully 
on board with doing business the way they’re doing business?’ If
not, I keep looking.”13 ■
Management Training and Support
Franchisors want to give their franchisees a greater chance for success than independent busi-
nesses and offer management training programs to franchisees prior to opening a new outlet. 
Many franchisors, especially well-established ones, also provide follow-up training and consult-
ing services. This service is vital because most franchisors do not require franchisees to have ex-
perience in the industry. These programs teach franchisees the fundamentals they need to know for 
day-to-day operations as well as the nuances of running their businesses successfully. After John 
Grassia and David Smith retired as pilots for large airlines, they embarked on their second careers 
as franchisees when they opened an Express Oil Change near Orlando, Florida. The franchisor’s 
support and training were primary drivers in their decision to go with Express Oil Change. Unlike 
some franchisors that sell franchises and say, “Good luck” to the buyer, Express Oil wants its

franchisees to succeed and offers them the support they need to achieve success. Grassia says that 
Express Oil is proactive in its support, noting that if franchise officials see a franchise struggling 
in a particular area, they are quick to offer help to resolve the problem.14
Training programs often involve both classroom and on-site instruction to teach franchisees 
the basic operations of the business. McDonald’s is famous for Hamburger University, where 
franchisees and their employees go to learn the proper systems and procedures for operating a 
restaurant successfully. Training involves classroom instruction from 19 faculty members from 
around the world, hands-on activities, simulations of events that franchisees are likely to encoun-
ter, and computerized e-learning modules at one of seven Hamburger University centers around
the world. More than 275,000 people have graduated from Hamburger University, earning their 
degrees in Hamburgerology.15
To ensure franchisees’ continued success, many franchisors supplement their start-up train-
ing programs with ongoing instruction and support. For instance, Ben & Jerry’s sends regional 
trainers to new franchisees’ locations for additional training before they open their Scoop Shops. 
Once they are up and running, franchisees also benefit from ongoing training programs from 
Ben & Jerry’s field-based support team.16 Franchisors offer these training programs because they
realize that their ultimate success depends on their franchisee’s success.
Brand-Name Appeal
A franchisee purchases the right to use a nationally known and advertised brand name for a prod-
uct or service. Thus, the franchisee has the advantage of identifying his business with a widely
recognized trademark, which provides a great deal of drawing power, particularly for franchisees
of established systems. Customers recognize the identifying trademark, the standard symbols, 
the store design, and the products of an established franchise. Because of the franchise’s name
recognition, franchisees who have just opened their outlets often discover a ready supply of 
customers ready to purchase their products or services. Entrepreneurs who launch independent 
businesses may have to work for years and spend many thousands of dollars in advertising to
build a customer base of equivalent size. “One of the reasons I bought an AAMCO [transmis-
sion repair] franchise was its name recognition,” says Stephen Rogers, who owns a franchise in
Lockport, New York.17
One of the basic tenets of franchising is cloning the franchisor’s success. For example, nearly
everyone recognizes the golden arches of McDonald’s or the pigtailed little girl on the Wendy’s 
sign (founder Dave Thomas named the company after his daughter) and the standard products 
and quality offered at each. A customer can be confident that the quality and content of a meal 
at a Fort Lauderdale McDonald’s will be consistent with a meal at a San Francisco McDonald’s. 
However, franchisees must be equally aware that negative actions by the franchisor or other fran-
chisees can undermine the value of the brand name and have a negative impact on other stores in 
the chain. From franchisees’ perspective, one of the most important functions that a franchisor 
performs is promoting and enhancing the company’s brand because a stellar brand perception 
among customers and potential customers translates directly into sales for franchisees. Guillermo 
Perales, who owns 398 franchises from seven different companies, ranging from Arby’s and 
Burger King to Del Taco and T-Mobile, is one of the most successful franchisees in the United
States and understands the necessity of proper brand management. “It’s very important for the 
franchisor to take care of the brand,” he says. “We [franchisees] all have a lot riding on this busi-
ness. Good management of the brand is essential.”18
Standardized Quality of Goods and Services
Because a franchisee purchases a license to sell the franchisor’s product or service and the privi-
lege of using the associated brand name, the quality of the goods or service sold determines 
the franchisor’s reputation. Building a sound reputation in business can take many years, but 
destroying a good reputation takes no time at all. If some franchisees are allowed to operate at 
substandard levels, the image of the entire chain suffers irreparable damage; therefore, franchi-
sors normally demand compliance with uniform standards of quality and service throughout the 
entire chain. In many cases, the franchisor conducts periodic inspections of local facilities to 
assist in maintaining acceptable levels of performance.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John Schnatter: Papa John’s John Schnatter, founder of 
Papa John’s, a fast-growing pizza franchise with more than 4,400 outlets in every state and 34 
global markets, makes personal visits to some of his franchisees’ stores four or five times each week
to make sure they are performing up to the company’s high quality standards. Franchisees say Schnat-
ter, known for his attention to detail, often checks pizzas for air bubbles in the crust or tomato sauce 
for freshness. “Pizza is Schnatter’s life, and he takes it very seriously,” says one industry analyst.19 ■
Maintaining quality is so important that most franchisors retain the right to terminate the fran-
chise contract and to repurchase the outlet if the franchisee fails to comply with established standards.
National Advertising Programs and Marketing Assistance
An effective advertising program is essential to the success of every franchise operation. Mar-
keting a brand-name product or service across a wide geographic area requires a far-reaching
advertising campaign. A regional or national advertising program benefits all franchisees, and 
most franchisors have one. In fact, one study reports that 79 percent of franchisors require franchi-
sees to contribute to a national advertising fund (the average amount is 2 percent of sales).20 Typi-
cally, these advertising campaigns are organized and controlled by the franchisor, but franchisees
actually pay for the campaigns. In fact, they are financed by each franchisee’s contribution of a 
percentage of monthly sales, usually 1 to 5 percent, or a flat monthly fee. For example, franchisees
at Subway, the sandwich chain with more than 42,000 restaurants in 107 countries, pay 4.5 percent 
of weekly gross sales to the company’s national advertising program. Subway pools these funds 
and uses them for a cooperative advertising program; doing so has more impact than if franchisees
spent the same amount of money separately.
Many franchisors also require franchisees to spend a minimum amount on local advertising. 
In fact, 41 percent of franchisors require their franchisees to invest in local advertising (once again, 
the average amount is 2 percent of sales).21 To supplement their national advertising efforts, both 
Wendy’s and Burger King require franchisees to spend at least 3 percent of gross sales on local 
advertising. Some franchisors assist franchisees in designing and producing local ads. Many com-
panies also help franchisees create marketing plans and provide professionally designed marketing 
materials, including outdoor advertisements, newspaper inserts, posters, banners, brochures, direct-
mail pieces, and platforms for social media and mobile marketing campaigns. Both Google and 
Facebook now offer marketing features that enable franchisors and
franchisees to collaborate on social media promotions and are de-
signed to increase companies’ reach by promoting posts on news 
feeds for a flat rate. Some franchisors provide a corporate social
media presence with links to franchisees’ local pages that allow 
franchisees to add their own content that is relevant to their cus-
tomers. For example, McDonald’s manages a corporate Facebook 
page where visitors can type in their zip codes to access the pages 
of their local franchises that feature content customized for them.
Other franchises, particularly those whose franchisees’ businesses 
vary depending on their location, allow their franchisees to control
their own social media presence. Buffalo Wild Wings follows this 
approach, and its franchisees use their own social media pages to 
promote local events, festivals, games featuring local teams, and 
specials.22
Nearly 27 percent of e-commerce Web traffic now origi-
nates from mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets.23
As mobile marketing becomes more prevalent, franchisors are 
developing mobile apps that make it easy for customers to pur-
chase from their franchisees. LaVida Massage, a chain with 
more than 50 franchises in the United States and Canada, re-
cently unveiled a mobile app that allows clients to schedule mas-
sages at its franchised locations, view their operating hours, and 
read about message therapists’ qualifications and specialties.24
Domino’s Pizza, a pizza franchise with nearly 11,000 outlets in

more than 70 countries, is the leader in mobile marketing in the pizza industry, with 35 percent 
of its online sales originating from mobile devices. Domino’s mobile app, which has been down-
loaded by more than 10 million customers, allows customers to place their orders in just seconds
and includes a “Pizza Tracker,” that permits customers to monitor their pizzas’ progress (“Our 
expert pizza maker, Antonio, put your pizza in the oven at 7:08 p.m.”) and know when it will ar-
rive. The latest version includes a Siri-like virtual assistant named Dom that enables customers 
to speak their orders (I’d like a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese”) without having to type
them in.25
Financial Assistance
Purchasing a franchise can be just as expensive (if not more so) than launching an independent 
business, and the recent upheaval in the financial markets has made many lenders hesitant to
fund business start-ups, including franchises. A study by FRANdata shows that the funding gap
between the capital that franchises need to grow and the capital that lenders actually provide has 
averaged nearly 9 percent per year for the last several years (see Figure 7.5). In one year alone,
that lack of funding translated into the “loss” of 2,200 outlets that franchisees could not open and 
would have added $6.1 billion to U.S. GDP.26
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Guillermo Perales: Sun Holdings LLC After graduating 
from college in Mexico and working for a large Mexican company, Guillermo Perales moved 
to Dallas, Texas, where he spotted many business opportunities. In 1997, Perales opened his first 
Golden Corral restaurant with the help of a $100,000 loan supported by an SBA guarantee. Today, 
Perales’s company, Sun Holdings LLC, owns 398 franchises from seven different companies and
generates annual sales of $400 million. “It’s better to be a part of a bigger [franchise] system,” 
says Perales. “It takes away some of the risk when you have a recognizable name, and it makes 
financing easier to get.”27 ■
Although franchisees typically invest a significant amount of their own money in their 
businesses, most need additional financing. In some cases, the franchisor will provide at least

some of that additional financing. A basic principle of franchising is to use franchisees’ money 
to grow their businesses, but some franchisors realize that because start-up costs have reached
breathtakingly high levels, they must provide financial help for franchisees. In fact, a study by 
FRANdata, a franchising research company, reports that 20 percent of franchisors offer direct 
financing to their franchisees.28 However, the credit crunch has caused a growing number of 
franchisors to provide financial assistance to franchisees. “Helping franchisees access financing
wasn’t a franchisor function a couple of years ago,” says Shelly Sun, founder and CEO of Bright-
Star Franchising LLC, which provides in-home care service for senior citizens and children. 
“Now it’s job number one.”29
Small franchise systems are more likely to provide direct financial assistance to franchisees
than are larger, more established franchisors. Traditionally, franchisors rarely make loans to en-
able franchisees to pay the initial franchise fee. However, once a franchisor locates a suitable 
prospective franchisee, it may offer the qualified candidate direct financial assistance in specific 
areas, such as purchasing equipment, inventory, or even the franchise fee.
In most instances, financial assistance from franchisors takes a form other than direct loans, 
leases, or short-term credit. Franchisors usually are willing to help qualified franchisees establish 
relationships with banks, nonbank lenders, and other sources of financing. The support and con-
nections from the franchisor enhance a franchisee’s credit standing because lenders recognize the 
lower failure rate among established franchises. For instance, Domino’s Pizza, the popular pizza 
franchise, recently forged a relationship with Balboa Capital, a lender that specializes in loans
to small and mid-sized companies and franchises, to be the preferred lender for its franchisees. 
Balboa Capital provides customized financing so that new franchisees can have sufficient work-
ing capital and can purchase furniture, fixtures, and equipment and existing franchisees can 
remodel their stores, make lease-hold improvements, and upgrade to the latest technology. As 
Domino’s Pizza’s preferred lender, Balboa Capital offers franchisees a simplified application and 
approval process with faster processing times.30
In an attempt to reignite their chains’ growth, some franchisors are reducing fees, cutting 
royalties, and extending credit to help franchisees open outlets. Papa John’s Pizza, the pizza 
franchise based in Louisville, Kentucky, recently offered an incentive package of discounts on 
its franchise fee and equipment worth $78,000 and a waiver for 18 months on royalties to new 
and existing franchisees. Joe Smith, Papa John’s global sales and development manager, says 
that the company wants its franchisees to get off to a good start. By investing less to open their 
restaurants, they are able to invest more in marketing and attracting large customer bases more 
quickly. Erik Severinghaus and his business partners have opened seven Papa John’s restaurants
in Chicago in just three years and are about to open another one. He says that he and his partners 
would not have opened as many outlets as quickly if it were not for the discounts that Papa John’s 
offered on capital equipment and the reductions in franchise fees and royalties.31
The Small Business Administration (SBA) has created a program called the Franchise 
Registry that is designed to provide financing for franchisees through its loan guarantee programs 
(more on these in Chapter 13). The Franchise Registry streamlines the loan application process
for franchisees who pass the screening tests at franchises that are members of the Registry. Fran-
chisors submit their franchise agreements and other documents to the Registry for preapproval 
by the SBA, which expedites the loan application process for prospective franchisees. Nearly 
1,500 franchises ranging from AAMCO Transmissions (automotive repair) to Zaxby’s (fast-food 
chicken restaurants) participate in the Franchise Registry program. Approximately 9.5 percent 
of all SBA loan guarantees go to franchisees. SBA-guaranteed loans to franchisees experience 
an average 6.5 percent charge-off rate (the percentage of the loan amount written off due to 
nonpayment), which is higher than the overall average charge-off rate of 1.3 percent for all SBA-
guaranteed loans.32 Franchisees who are interested in the Franchise Registry program should visit 
its Web site at www.franchiseregistry.com.
In January 2011, the International Franchise Association created the VetFran program to
help military veterans gain access to franchising opportunities by providing training, financial as-
sistance, and information. More than 580 franchisors participate in the VetFran program, offering
financial incentives and mentoring to prospective franchisees. So far, the program has produced
nearly 5,200 new franchise owners who are military veterans.33

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Kevin and Laurel Wilkerson: Boomer Pizza LLC Kevin 
and Laurel Wilkerson, both of whom served in the Army (Kevin as an Infantry Officer and
Laurel as an attorney in the JAG Corps), decided that franchising was a natural fit for a second career. 
The VetFran program, which gave them a $5,000 discount on their franchise fee, and their combined
44 years of military service have helped them become successful Marco’s Pizza franchisees. “What I
enjoyed about the Army was the variety of things I did every day,” says Kevin. “Franchising tends to 
be similar to that.” Through their company, Boomer Pizza LLC, the Wilkersons own seven Marco’s 
Pizza outlets in Edmond, Oklahoma. The copreneurs’ management skills are complementary. “I tend
to be more involved in site selection, design, operations, and finance,” says Kevin. “[Laurel] handles
the HR, client, and government issues. She’s also involved with store openings and training.”34 ■
Proven Products, Processes, and Business Formats
As we have seen, franchisees essentially purchase a franchisor’s experience in the form of a 
business system. A franchise owner does not have to build the business from scratch. Instead of 
being forced to rely solely on personal ability to establish business processes and attract a clien-
tele, a franchisee can depend on the methods and techniques of an established business. At Papa
John’s, researchers are constantly looking for ways to improve their pizza and their franchisees’ 
operations. Recent improvements include a simple system for making sauce measurements more
precise and an oven calibration process to ensure more even heating throughout franchisees’ 
pizza ovens, thereby producing more consistent pizzas.35 These standardized procedures and op-
erations greatly enhance the franchisee’s chances of success and avoid the most inefficient type
of learning—trial and error. In addition, franchisees do not have to struggle for recognition in the 
local marketplace as much as independent owners do.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John Grassia and David Smith: Express Oil Change John 
Grassia and David Smith, the former airline pilots who became Express Oil Change franchisees 
when they retired, understand better than most the importance of standard processes. They cite
Express Oil Change’s standardized processes as one of the factors that drew them to the franchise. 
As former pilots, the franchisees were accustomed to following standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) and were impressed by Express Oil’s extensive system of SOPS, which they know from expe-
rience minimize errors and improve performance.36 ■
Centralized Buying Power
A significant advantage a franchisee has over an independent small business owner is participa-
tion in the franchisor’s centralized, volume buying power. If franchisors sell goods and supplies 
to franchisees (not all do), they may pass on to franchisees cost savings from quantity discounts
they earn by buying in volume. Tom Curdes, owner of two Weed Man franchises in Toledo, Ohio, 
cites the lawn care franchisor’s buying power as a major advantage. “The national buying power 
and the negotiations [with vendors] they do behind the scenes . . . I couldn’t do that myself,” says 
Curdes, whose franchises generate $750,000 in sales and employ 25 people.37
Site Selection and Territorial Protection
A proper location is critical to the success of any small business, and franchises are no exception.
In fact, franchise experts consider the three most important factors in franchising to be location, 
location, and location. Most franchisors offer franchisees site selection assistance to increase the
probability that their outlets will attract sufficient numbers of customers, reach their break-even 
points quickly, and generate consistent profits. CiCi’s Pizza, a family-oriented, buffet-style res-
taurant chain based in Coppell, Texas, with nearly 500 locations in 34 states, recently entered into 
a partnership with Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, one of the top real estate advisory firms in the 
world, to enhance the company’s comprehensive site selection software and process. The goal is 
to find the ideal location for every new restaurant the company opens, including non-traditional
locations such as universities, airports, casinos, military bases, and others.38
Sometimes, entrepreneurs discover that becoming affiliated with a franchisor is the best way 
to get into prime locations. Many franchisors conduct an extensive location analysis for each new
outlet, including researching traffic patterns, zoning ordinances, accessibility, and population den-
sity. McDonald’s, for example, is well known for its ability to obtain prime locations in high-traffic 

CHAPTER 7 • FRANCHISING AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
275
areas. Although choosing a location usually is the franchisee’s responsibility, some franchisors
control the site selection process. Stephen Rogers decided to leave a family business to purchase 
an AAMCO transmission service franchise and relied on the franchisor to select a location for his
service center because of the company’s experience in selecting prime locations for their outlets. 
(AAMCO has been selling franchises since 1963.)39 Even when the franchisee makes the location 
decision, the franchisor reserves the right to approve the final site. Choosing a suitable location 
requires a thorough location analysis, including studies of traffic patterns, zoning ordinances, ac-
cessibility, population density, and demographics. You will learn more about the location decision 
in Chapter 14.
Some franchisors offer franchisees territorial protection, which gives existing franchisees 
the right to exclusive distribution of brand-name goods or services within a particular geographic 
area. A clause establishing such a protective zone that bars other outlets from the same franchise 
from locating there gives franchisees significant protection and security. Even when a franchi-
sor grants territorial protection, the size of a franchisee’s territory can vary significantly. The
purpose of territorial protection is to prevent an invasion of the existing franchisee’s territory and
the resulting dilution of sales. One study of successful franchises reports that the failure rate for 
franchisees is lower in systems that offer exclusive territories than in those that do not.40
As existing markets have become increasingly saturated with franchise outlets, the place-
ment of new outlets has become a source of friction between franchisors and franchisees. Exist-
ing franchisees complain that franchisors are encroaching on their territories by granting new
franchises so close to them that their sales are diluted. Before signing a franchise contract, every 
prospective franchisee must know exactly the scope of territorial protection, if any, the franchisor 
guarantees. A fast-growing franchise may be a sign of a healthy business model, but it also may
indicate future conflicts between the franchisor and franchisees over encroachment. Why invest 
years building a successful franchise in a particular location only to have the franchisor allow 
another franchisee to open nearby, siphoning off sales of the existing outlet?
Greater Chance for Success
Investing in a franchise is not risk free. In a typical year, between 150 and 200 new franchises en-
ter the market each year, but not all of them survive.41 A study by The Coleman Report provides an
indicator of the failure rate of franchises; over a recent 13-year period, an average of 12.5 percent 
of franchisees who received SBA-guaranteed loans failed to repay them, but the nonpayment rate 
ranged from 0 to 67 percent, depending on the chain.42 Despite the fact that franchising offers no 
guarantees of success, experts contend that franchising is less risky than building a business from 
the ground up. The tradition of success for franchises is attributed to the broad range of services, 
assistance, standard procedures, and the comprehensive business system that the franchisor pro-
vides. Statistics regarding the success of a given franchise must be interpreted carefully, however.
For example, sometimes when a franchise is in danger of failing, the franchisor often repurchases 
or relocates the outlet and does not report it as a failure.* As a result, some franchisors boast of 
never experiencing a failure.
A recent study of franchises reports that the success rate of franchisees is higher when a
franchise system does the following:
● Requires franchisees to have prior industry experience
● Requires franchisees to actively manage their stores (no “absentee” owners)
● Has built a strong brand name
● Offers training programs designed to improve franchisees’ knowledge and skills43
The risk involved in purchasing a franchise is two pronged: Success—or failure—depends 
on the franchisee’s managerial skills and motivation and on the franchisor’s business experience,
system, and support. Many franchisees are convinced that franchising has been the key to their 
success in business. Their success is proof of the common sentiment that franchising offers the 
*As long as an outlet’s doors never close, most franchisors do not count it as a failure even if the outlet has struggled 
for survival and has been through a series of owners who have tried unsuccessfully to turn around its performance.

276
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Although opening a franchise is not a “sure thing,” franchising’s
immense popularity is due, in part, to the support, experience, 
and training that franchisors provide their franchisees. Many 
would-be entrepreneurs believe that franchising reduces their risk 
of failure and see it as the key to their success. Large, established
franchises have systems in place that have been replicated thou-
sands of times and allow franchisees to follow a formula for suc-
cess that the franchisor has worked out over many years. Many 
small franchisors don’t have the benefit of learning from the mis-
takes of setting up thousands of outlets to fine-tune their business 
systems. Some franchisors build their business models on fads that 
will fade while others tap into meaningful trends. Some of these 
small franchises have the potential to become tomorrow’s fran-
chise giants; others will fall by the wayside.
TITLE Boxing Club
Americans now live longer than ever before, but obesity represents
a significant threat to public health. According to the International 
Health, Racquet, and Sportsclub Association, the number of gym or 
health club memberships has increased from 41.3 million in 2005 
to 50.2 million today, although many clubs, especially those offer-
ing a full range of services and the resulting higher fees, struggled 
during the last recession. Danny Campbell, a retired professional 
boxer, knew firsthand what a great workout a boxing regime of-
fers (burning up to 1,000 calories in an hour) but realized that
most boxing gyms were located in seedy parts of town and were 
a bit rough around the edges. In 2008, Campbell and Tom Lyons,
founder of travel club agency Global Connections, opened a box-
ing fitness club in Overland Park, Kansas that offered one-hour
(“Power Hour”) boxing workouts minus the sparring led by expe-
rienced trainers aimed at young people who want to stay in shape 
but who lack the time for lengthy workouts. They soon struck a 
deal with boxing equipment maker TITLE to use its well-known
name and created a retail space in the club to sell gear. TITLE Box-
ing Club was a hit with customers, and after opening two more 
clubs, Campbell and Lyons began making plans to sell franchises. 
They approached John Rotche, who had been a top manager at
Domino’s Pizza and Krispy Kreme before starting two franchises of
his own, Ductz (a duct-cleaning business) and Hoodz (a commer-
cial kitchen hood-cleaning business) for advice. Rotche joined the 
company full time, and TITLE Boxing Club sold its first franchise in 
2010. Rotche expanded the number of franchises from 60 to 500
in just 18 months and generated system-wide sales of $25 million. 
Sales continue to grow rapidly; the company is on track to double
its annual sales to $50 million this year. Rotche says that TITLE’s
appeal comes from the company’s strategy of taking an engaging 
workout that produces results and typically exists only in the gritti-
est sections of a town and offering it to customers in a convenient
location near traditional retailers such as Target or Starbucks.
Purchasing a TITLE Boxing Club franchise requires an 
investment of between $187,000 and $364,000, including a 
$35,000 franchise fee ($29,000 for three or more outlets). Franchi-
sees also pay a royalty of 7 percent of their sales to the franchisor. 
“A big part of TITLE’s success is a direct result of the short time 
franchisees take to break even,” says Rotche. A club can operate
in a relatively small space and requires only about 10 employees.
On the revenue side, each club generates sales from both monthly 
membership fees and its retail store that sells workout gear. Be-
cause TITLE is a partner in the business, franchisees can purchase
the equipment for their clubs at cost. The franchisor provides fran-
chises with a one-week training program, an annual conference, 
and daily webinars. Multi-unit ownership is common; the typical 
TITLE Boxing Club franchisee owns three outlets.
LYFE Kitchen
Only 24 percent of people who eat at restaurants eat a healthy
meal, and the founders of LYFE (Love Your Food Everyday) Kitchen 
want to change that. The fast-casual restaurant offers meals that
contain no more than 600 calories and 1,000 milligrams of so-
dium, including dishes such as sweet corn chowder, fish tacos, 
roasted salmon, baked sweet potato fries, seasonal flatbread sand-
wiches, fruit smoothies, and many others. LYFE Kitchen uses whole
grains, local fruits and vegetables, responsibly raised meats, and 
organic ingredients (when possible). The menu also contains veg-
etarian, vegan, and gluten-free items as well. Typical lunch prices 
are from $6 to $8, and dinner prices are $14 to $18. The company 
also markets a line of LYFE Kitchen-branded frozen foods through
2,000 grocery stores nationwide.
In 2010, Stephen Sidwell, a former executive with Gardein, 
a company that sells a meat substitute, took his idea for a healthy 
fast-casual restaurant to former McDonald’s top executives Mike 
Roberts and Mike Donahue. The business partners brought two 
other key players into the business: celebrity chef Art Smith and 
Tal Ronnen, a famous vegetarian and vegan chef. They opened
the first LYFE Kitchen in Palo Alto, California, in 2011. It was so 
successful that within months they opened a second location 
in Culver City, California. The founders began developing plans
to franchise LYFE Kitchen, and the first franchise opened in
Chicago in 2013. The initial investment to open a LYFE Kitchen is 
$1.5 million, which includes a $35,000 franchise fee and the latest

also pay a 5 percent (of sales) royalty to the franchisor. Currently
with three franchised locations, LYFE Kitchen plans to have 
250 locations, primarily in urban areas, across the United States
within five years. The company seeks as franchisees people who 
have at least 15 years of business experience (preferably in the 
hospitality industry), $3 million in net worth, and a desire to open 
multiple outlets within a defined territory.

opportunity to be in business for yourself but not 
r
by yourself. In a recent survey by Franchise 
Direct, the main reason (cited by 51 percent of respondents) that prospective franchisees give 
for considering investing in a franchise is that they want to be their own bosses without hav-
ing to start completely from “scratch.”44 “[Franchising is] the perfect combination of having an 
independently owned and operated office, but with support,” says Olivier Hecht, who left his 
corporate job to open a Handyman Matters home repair franchise.45
The Drawbacks of Buying a Franchise
The benefits of buying a franchise can mean the difference between success and failure for some 
entrepreneurs. Prospective franchisees must understand the disadvantages of franchising before 
choosing this method of doing business. Perhaps the biggest drawback of franchising is that a
franchisee must sacrifice some freedom to the franchisor. Other disadvantages are discussed in
the following sections.
Franchise Fees and Ongoing Royalties
Virtually every franchisor imposes some type of fees and demands a share of franchisees’ sales 
revenue in return for the use of the franchisor’s name, products or services, and business sys-
tem. The fees and the initial capital requirements vary among the different franchisors. The total
investment required for a franchise varies from around $3,500 for some home-based service
franchises to $20 million or more for hotel and motel franchises. For example, Jazzercise, an 
aerobics exercise franchise, requires a capital investment that ranges from just $4,300 to $76,500, 
and Subway, the sandwich and salad chain, estimates that the total cost of opening a franchise
ranges from $85,700 for a kiosk location to $262,850 for a traditional restaurant. Culver’s, a fast-
growing regional chain that sells sandwiches (including the delicious ButterBurger®), salads, 
dinners, and frozen custard, requires an investment of $1.44 million to $3.08 million, depending 
on land acquisition and building construction costs. Franchisees use many of the same sources 
to finance franchises that independent entrepreneurs use to finance their start-up companies (see 
Figure 7.6).
Start-up costs for franchises often include a variety of fees. Most franchises impose an initial
franchise fee for the right to use the company name. The average up-front fee that franchisors
charge is $25,147.46 Subway’s franchise fee is $15,000, but Culver’s charges a franchise fee of 
$55,000. Other franchise start-up costs might include fees for location analysis, site purchase and 
preparation, construction, signs, fixtures, equipment, management assistance, and training. Some 
franchise fees include these costs, but others do not. Before signing any contract, a prospective 
franchisee should determine the total cost of a franchise, something that every franchisor is re-
quired to disclose in item 7 of its Franchise Disclosure Document (see the section “Franchising
and the Law” later in this chapter).

278
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
Franchisors also impose continuing royalty fees as revenue-sharing devices. The royalty 
usually involves a percentage of gross sales with a required minimum, or a flat fee levied on 
the franchise. (In fact, 82 percent of franchisors charge a royalty based on a percentage of 
franchisees’ sales.47) Royalty fees range from 1 to 11 percent, and the average royalty rate is
6.7 percent.48 Culver’s charges franchisees a royalty of 4 percent of gross sales, which is payable 
weekly, and Subway charges a royalty of 8 percent of weekly gross sales. These ongoing royal-
ties increase a franchisee’s overhead expenses significantly. Because the franchisor’s royalties 
and fees (the total fees the average franchisor collects amount to 8.4 percent of a franchisee’s 
sales) are calculated as a percentage of a franchisee’s sales, the franchisor gets paid even if the 
franchisee fails to earn a profit.49 Sometimes, unprepared franchisees discover (too late) that a 
franchisor’s royalties and fees are the equivalent of the normal profit margin for a business. To 
avoid this problem, prospective franchisees should determine exactly how much fees will be and 
then weigh the benefits of the services and benefits the fees cover. One of the best ways to do
this is to itemize what you are getting for your money and then determine whether the cost is 
worth the benefits provided. Be sure to get the details on all expenses—the amount, the timing 
of payments, and financing arrangements; find out which items, if any, are included in the initial 
franchise fee and which ones are “extra.”
Strict Adherence to Standardized Operations
Although franchisees own their businesses, they do not have the autonomy that independent 
owners have. To protect its image, a franchisor requires that franchisees maintain certain operat-
ing standards. In fact, conformity is standard operating procedure in franchising. The franchisor 
controls the layout and the color schemes that its franchisees use in their stores, the products 
they sell, the personnel and operating policies they use, and many other aspects of running the

business. At McDonald’s, franchisees must operate their businesses by the franchise manual,
which specifies nearly every detail of running a franchise—including how many hamburger pat-
ties per pound of beef (10), how long to toast a bun (17 seconds), and how much sanitizer to use 
when cleaning the milkshake machine (one packet for 2.5 gallons of water).
If a franchise constantly fails to meet the minimum standards established for the business, 
the franchisor may terminate its license. Many franchisors determine compliance with standards 
with periodic inspections and secret shoppers. Secret shoppers work for a survey company and, 
although they look like any other customer, are trained to observe and then later record on a 
checklist a franchise’s performance on key standards, such as cleanliness, speed of service, 
employees’ appearances and attitudes, and others. At Five Guys Burgers and Fries, founder Jerry 
Murrell uses secret shoppers to ensure that franchisees comply with the company’s strict quality 
and service standards. Five Guys conducts two independent audits of every store every week. 
One is a secret shopper who poses as a customer and rates everything from the courtesy of the 
crew and the appearance of the food to the cleanliness of the bathrooms and the time required for 
service; the other audit focuses on safety.50 At times, strict adherence to franchise standards may 
become a burden to some franchisees.
Restrictions on Purchasing and Prices
In the interest of maintaining quality standards, franchisors may require franchisees to purchase 
products, special equipment, or other items from the franchisor or from a list of “approved” sup-
pliers. For example, KFC requires that franchisees use only seasonings blended by a particular 
company because a poor image could result from franchisees using inferior products to cut costs. 
Under some conditions, these purchase arrangements may be challenged in court as a violation 
of antitrust laws, but generally franchisors have a legal right to ensure that franchisees maintain 
acceptable quality standards. Franchisees recently filed another round of lawsuits against Quiznos, 
a chain of sandwich shops, in which they allege that the franchisor, based in Denver, Colorado, 
engaged in fraud and misdealing by requiring franchisees to purchase food and supplies from the 
franchisor’s supply division. The complaints contend that Quiznos, whose domestic franchisee
count has declined by 2,500 since 2006, earned millions in profits using “hidden markups” on 
items that the contract requires franchisees to purchase from the franchisor, while most franchi-
sees were “losing money or barely breaking even.”51
For many years, franchisors could legally set the prices they charge for the products they sell 
to franchisees but could not control the retail prices franchisees charge for products. However,
two U.S. Supreme Court decisions (State Oil Company vs. Khan in 1997 and Leegin Creative
Leather Products vs. PSKS, Inc. in 2007) opened the door for franchisors to establish maximum 
prices that franchisees can charge. Many franchisors do not impose maximum prices, choosing 
instead to provide franchisees with suggested prices, but some do establish price limits. “Value
menus” have become a source of contention for franchisees of many quick-service restaurants 
because franchisors impose price limits on items that appear on their value menus. Value menus
are an important revenue source for franchises, accounting for 13 to 15 percent of sales, but fran-
chisees complain that making a profit on low-priced items is difficult. To address its franchisees’ 
concerns, McDonald’s replaced its “Dollar Menu” with the “Dollar Menu and More,” which 
includes 25 items priced between $1 and $2. The new menu gives franchisees more flexibility 
in pricing and allows them to offset rising commodity and labor costs.52 Several Steak ‘n Shake 
franchisees have been locked in a legal battle with the franchisor over the franchisor’s insistence
that all franchisees comply with its “4 Meals for $4” promotion. The franchisees recently won
an injunction against Steak ‘n Shake, effectively blocking the policy that required franchisees to
abide by the prices the franchisor sets for its menu items. Stuller, Inc., the chain’s oldest franchi-
see, argued that the policy would cost its five franchises nearly $700,000 per year.53
Limited Product Line
In most cases, the franchise agreement stipulates that the franchisee can sell only those products 
approved by the franchisor. Unless they are willing to risk the cancellation of their licenses, fran-
chisees must avoid selling any unapproved products through the franchise. A franchise may be 
required to carry an unpopular product or be prevented from introducing a desirable one by the 
franchise agreement. A franchisee’s freedom to adapt a product line to local market conditions is 

280
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
restricted. However, some franchisors actively solicit innovations and product suggestions from 
their franchisees. Subway’s wildly successful “$5 Footlong” idea did not come from corporate 
headquarters but originated with Miami franchisee Stuart Frankel.54 Some of McDonald’s most 
successful products came not from the corporate kitchen but from franchisees such as Jim
Delligatti, who invented the legendary Big Mac in 1967. In 1968, McDonald’s put the sandwich
on franchisees’ menus, where its original price was 49 cents. Today, McDonald’s sells 560 million 
Big Macs each year—an average of more than 17 sandwiches per second!55 Some franchisees
are concerned that McDonald’s has developed no “home run” products for its menu since the 
successful introduction of McGriddles, a pancake sandwich, in 2003. Many franchisees also
complain that they throw away more of the chain’s “healthy” menu items, such as salads, which 
make up only 2 to 3 percent of sales, than they sell.56
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Diana Tavary: Curves Some franchisees of Curves, a chain 
of exercise outlets that offer a 30-minute workout aimed at busy women, claim that the
company ignored their requests to update its exercise format to help them retain members and 
attract new ones. Diana Tavary walked away from her Curves franchise after 10 years because the
company failed to adapt to new exercise trends. One business broker in the fitness industry, agrees, 
pointing out that Curves allowed franchisees to offer only the standard 30-minute workout, de-
spite feedback from franchisees indicating that customers wanted other exercise options. Franchi-
sees say they have lost business to rival gyms that allow customers to exercise at any time without
supervision because the company does not allow that practice. Curves, which started franchising in
1995, has 4,000 franchised outlets, about half the number it had at its peak in 2005.57 ■
Contract Terms and Renewal
Because franchise contracts are written by the franchisor’s attorneys, they always are written in fa-
vor of the franchisor. Some franchisors are willing to negotiate the terms of their contracts, but many 
of the well-established franchisors are not because they know they don’t have to. The franchise con-
tract is extremely important because it governs the franchisor–franchisee relationship over its life, 
which may last as long as 20 years. In fact, the average length of a franchise contract is 10.5 years.58
Franchisees also should understand the terms and conditions under which they may renew 
their franchise contracts at the expiration of the original agreement. In most cases, franchisees are 
required to pay a renewal fee and to repair any deficiencies in their outlets or to modernize and
upgrade them. One study by the International Franchise Association and FRANdata reports that 
the renewal rate of franchise agreements is 94 percent.59
Unsatisfactory Training Programs
A major benefit of purchasing a franchise is the training that the franchisor provides franchisees 
so that they are able to run successful operations. The quality of franchise training programs can 
vary dramatically, however. “Many franchisees think they will get a lot of training but find out 
it’s a one-week crash course,” says Marko Grunhagen, a franchising expert at Southern Illinois 
University.60 Before signing on with a franchise, it is wise to find out the details of the training 
program the franchisor provides to avoid unpleasant surprises.
Market Saturation
Franchisees in fast-growing systems reap the benefits of the franchisor’s expanding reach, but 
they also may encounter the downside of a franchisor’s aggressive growth strategy: market satu-
ration. As the owners of many fast-food, sandwich shops, and yogurt and ice cream franchises 
have discovered, market saturation is a very real danger. One researcher has determined that 
only one place in the contiguous 48 states, a high plain in northwestern South Dakota, is more 
than 100 miles from a McDonald’s restaurant.61 Subway, which started franchising in 1974, has
grown from just 166 outlets in 1981 to more than 42,000 outlets today!62 Any franchise growing 
that rapidly runs the risk of having outlets so close together that they cannibalize sales from one
another, causing them to struggle to reach their break-even points.
As you learned in the previous section, although some franchisors offer franchisees territorial 
protection, others do not. Territorial encroachment, competition from within the franchise, has 
become a hotly contested issue in franchising as growth-seeking franchisors have exhausted most 

CHAPTER 7 • FRANCHISING AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
281
of the prime locations and are now setting up new franchises in close proximity to existing ones. 
Franchise experts consistently site territorial encroachment as the primary threat to franchisees.
Less Freedom
When franchisees sign a contract, they agree to sell the franchisor’s product or service by follow-
ing its prescribed formula. This feature of franchising is the source of the system’s success, but 
it also gives many franchisees the feeling that they are reporting to a “boss.” Franchisors want to 
ensure franchisees’ success, and most monitor their franchisees’ performances closely to make 
sure that franchisees follow the system’s specifications. “Everything you do in a franchise will be 
dictated [by the franchisor] from the moment you turn the key in the door in the morning,” warns
Eric Karp, a Boston attorney who teaches franchising at Babson College.63
Strict uniformity is the rule rather than the exception. For example, a group of franchisees 
filed a lawsuit against Burger King, claiming that the company had no right to require them to 
open their stores as early as 6 a.m. and to stay open as late as 2 a.m., but the court dismissed
their argument, ruling that the franchise contract, which authorized the extended hours, is unam-
biguous and enforceable.64 “There is no independence,” says one writer. “Successful franchisees 
are happy prisoners.”65 As a result, highly independent, “go-my-own-way” entrepreneurs often
are frustrated with the basic “go-by-the-rules” philosophy of franchising. Table 7.1 describes
10 myths of franchising.
Franchising and the Law
The franchising boom spearheaded by McDonald’s and others in the late 1950s brought with 
it many prime investment opportunities. However, the explosion of legitimate franchises also 
ushered in with it numerous fly-by-night franchisors who defrauded their franchisees. By the 
1970s, franchising was rife with fraudulent practitioners. David Kaufman, a renowned franchise 
expert with more than 30 years of experience, says, “In the late 1960s and 1970s, the words 
‘franchise’ and ‘fraud’ had almost become synonymous.”66 Thousands of people lost millions of 
dollars to criminals and unscrupulous operators who sold flawed business concepts and phantom
franchises to unsuspecting investors. In an effort to control the rampant fraud in the industry and 
the potential for deception inherent in a franchise relationship, California in 1971 enacted the 
first Franchise Investment Law. The law (and those of 14 other states that passed similar laws) 
required franchisors to register a Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC) and deliver a
copy to prospective franchisees before any offer or sale of a franchise. In October 1979, the Fed-
eral Trade Commission (FTC) adopted similar legislation at the national level that established
full disclosure guidelines for any company selling franchises and was designed to give potential
franchisees the information they needed to protect themselves from unscrupulous franchisors.
In 2008, the FTC replaced the UFOC with a similar document, the Franchise Disclosure 
Document (FDD), which requires all franchisors to provide detailed information on their opera-
tions at least 14 days before a franchisee signs a contract or pays any money. The FDD applies 
to all franchisors, even those in the 35 states that lack franchise disclosure laws. The purpose of 
the regulation is to assist potential franchisees’ investigations of a franchise deal and to introduce
consistency into the franchisor’s disclosure statements. The FTC also established a “plain Eng-
lish” requirement for the FDD that prohibits legal and technical jargon and makes a document 
easy to read and understand. The FTC’s philosophy is not so much to prosecute abusers as to 
provide information to prospective franchisees and help them to make intelligent decisions. 
Although the FTC requires each franchisor to provide a potential franchisee with this informa-
tion, it does not verify its accuracy. Prospective franchisees should use this document only as a 
starting point for their investigations.
The Trade Regulation Rule requires a franchisor to include 23 major topics in its disclosure 
statement:
1. Information identifying the franchisor and its affiliates and describing the franchisor’s busi-
ness experience and the franchises being sold.
2. Information identifying and describing the business experience of each of the franchisor’s
officers, directors, and managers responsible for the franchise program.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
TABLE 7.1 10 Myths of Franchising
Myth #1. Franchising is the safest way to go into business because franchises never fail: Although 
the failure rate for franchises is lower than that of independent businesses, there are no guarantees of 
success. Franchises can—and do—fail. Potential franchisees must exercise the same degree of caution
in judging the risk of a franchise as they would any other business.
Myth #2. I’ll be able to open my franchise for less money than the franchisor estimates: Launching a 
business, including a franchise, normally takes more money and more time than entrepreneurs estimate. 
Be prepared. One franchisee of a retail computer store advises, “If a franchisor tells you you’ll need 
$100,000 to get started, you better have $150,000.”
Myth #3. The bigger the franchise organization, the more successful I’ll be: Bigger is not always
better in the franchise business. Some of the largest franchise operations are struggling to maintain 
their growth rates because the best locations are already taken and their markets have become saturated. 
Market saturation is a significant problem for many large franchises, and smaller franchises are account-
ing for much of the growth in the industry. Early franchisees in new franchise systems often can negoti-
ate better deals and receive more individual attention from the franchisor than those who purchase units 
in well-established systems.
Myth #4. I’ll use 80 percent of the franchisor’s business system, but I’ll improve on it by substitut-
ing my experience and know-how: When franchisees buy a franchise, they are buying, in essence, the 
franchisor’s experience and knowledge. Why pay all of that money to a franchisor if you aren’t willing 
to use their system? When franchisors screen potential franchisees, they look for people who are willing 
to fit into their systems rather than fiercely independent entrepreneurs. “[Franchisors] have spent years 
building the company,” says Jeff Elgin, founder of FranChoice, a franchise referral consulting firm. 
“They don’t want someone who will come in and try to innovate because that produces chaos.” Ideally, 
franchisors look for franchisees who exhibit a balance between the freewheeling entrepreneurial spirit 
and a system-focused approach.
Myth #5. All franchises are basically the same: Each franchise has its own unique personality, require-
ments, procedures, and culture. Naturally, some will suit you better than others. Avoid the tendency to 
select the franchise that offers the lowest cost. If the franchise does not fit your needs, it is not a bargain, 
no matter how inexpensive it is. Ask the franchisor and existing franchisees lots of questions to determine
how well you will fit into the system. One of the best ways to get a feel for a franchise’s personality is to 
work in a unit for a time.
Myth #6. I don’t have to be a hands-on manager. I can be an absentee owner and still be very 
successful: Most franchisors shy away from absentee owners, and some simply do not allow them in 
their systems at all. They know that franchise success requires lots of hands-on attention, and the franchise 
owner is the best person to provide that.
Myth #7. Anyone can be a satisfied, successful franchise owner: With more than 3,000 franchises 
available, the odds of finding a franchise that appeals to your tastes are high. However, not everyone is 
cut out to be a franchisee. “If a person is highly entrepreneurial, he or she should not even consider a
franchise investment,” says Kevin Murphy, a franchise attorney. Those “free spirits” who insist on doing
things their way most likely will be miserable in a franchise.
Myth #8. Franchising is the cheapest way to get into business for yourself: Although bargains do exist 
in franchising, the price tag for buying into some well-established systems is breathtaking, sometimes 
running more than $1 million. Franchisors look for candidates who are on solid financial footing.
Myth #9. The franchisor will solve my business problems for me; after all, that’s why I pay an ongoing 
royalty. Although franchisors offer franchisees start-up and ongoing training programs, they will not run
their franchisees’ businesses for them. As a franchisee, your job is to take the formula that the franchisor 
has developed and make it work in your location. Expect to solve many of your own problems.
Myth #10. Once I open my franchise, I’ll be able to run things the way I want to: Franchisees are not 
free to run their businesses as they see fit. Every franchisee signs a contract that requires him or her to 
run the business according to the franchisor’s requirements. Franchisees who violate the terms of that 
agreement run the risk of having their franchise relationship terminated.

3. A description of the lawsuits in which the franchisor and its officers, directors, and man-
agers have been involved. Although most franchisors will have been involved in some 
type of litigation, an excessive number of lawsuits, particularly if they relate to the same 
problem, is alarming. Another red flag is an excessive number of lawsuits brought against 
the franchisor by franchisees. “The history of the litigation will tell you the future of your 
relationship [with the franchisor],” says the founder of a maid-service franchise.67
4. Information about any bankruptcies in which the franchisor and its officers, directors, and 
managers have been involved.
5. Information about the initial franchise fee and other payments required to obtain the fran-
chise, the intended use of the fees, and the conditions under which the fees are refundable.
6. A table that describes all of the other fees that franchisees are required to make after start-
up, including royalties, service fees, training fees, lease payments, advertising or marketing 
charges, and others. The table also must include the due dates for the fees.
7. A table that shows the components of a franchisee’s total initial investment. The categories 
included are preopening expenses, the initial franchise fee, training expenses, equipment, 
opening inventory, initial advertising fee, signs, real estate (purchased or leased), equip-
ment, opening inventory, security deposits, business licenses, initial advertising fees, and
other expenses, such as legal and accounting fees. Also included is an estimate of amount 
of working capital a franchisee should have on hand to sustain the company in its first 
three months of operation. (Franchisees should be aware that the actual amount of capital 
required to keep a franchise going until it generates positive cash flow is probably much 
higher.) These estimates, usually stated as a range, give prospective franchisees an idea of 
how much their total start-up costs will be. Franchising expert Don Schadle says that for a 
typical franchisee, the total cost to open a franchise is $150,000; only 5 percent of franchi-
sees invest more than $500,000.68
8. Information about quality requirements of goods, services, equipment, supplies, inventory, 
and other items used in the franchise and where franchisees may purchase them, including 
required purchases from the franchisor. When interviewing existing franchisees, prospec-
tive franchisees should ask whether the prices the franchisees pay for products and services 
are reasonable.
9. A cross-reference table that shows the location in the FDD and in the franchise contract of 
the description of the franchisee’s obligations under the franchise contract.
10. A description of the financial assistance (if any) available from the franchisor in the purchase 
of the franchise. Although many franchisors do not offer direct financial assistance to franchi-
sees, they may have special arrangements with lenders who help franchisees find financing.
11. A description of all obligations the franchisor must fulfill to help a franchisee prepare to 
open and operate a unit, including site selection, advertising, computer systems, pricing, 
training (a table describing the length and type of training is required), and other forms of 
assistance provided to franchisees. This usually is the longest section of the FDD.
12. A description of any territorial protection that the franchise receives and a statement as to
whether the franchisor may locate a company-owned store or other franchised outlet in that 
territory. The franchisor must specify whether it offers exclusive or nonexclusive territo-
ries. Given the controversy in many franchises over market saturation, franchisees should 
pay close attention to this section. Prospective franchisees should recognize the risk of 
investing in a franchise that provides no territorial protection or exclusive territories.
13. All relevant information about the franchisor’s trademarks, service marks, trade names, 
logos, and commercial symbols, including where they are registered. Prospective franchisees 
should look for a strong trademark or service mark that is registered with the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office.
14. Similar information on any patents, copyrights, and proprietary processes that the franchi-
sor owns and the rights that franchisees have to use them.

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
15. A description of the extent to which franchisees must participate personally in the opera-
tion of the franchise. Many franchisors look for hands-on franchisees and discourage or 
even prohibit absentee owners.
16. A description of any restrictions on the goods or services that franchises are permitted to 
sell and with whom franchisees may deal. The agreement usually restricts franchisees to
selling only those items the franchisor has approved.
17. A table that describes the conditions under which the franchise may be repurchased 
or refused renewal by the franchisor, transferred to a third party by the franchisee, and
terminated or modified by either party. This section also addresses the methods established
for resolving disputes, usually either mediation or arbitration, between franchisees and the 
franchisor. One recent study reports that 44 percent of franchisors’ contracts contain arbi-
tration clauses, which means that if a dispute arises, the parties must submit the dispute to 
arbitration rather than resolve it in the courts.69
18. A description of the involvement of celebrities and public figures in the franchise. Less than 
1 percent of franchise systems use public figures as part of their promotional strategies.70
19. A complete statement of the basis for any earnings claims made to the franchisee, 
including the percentage of existing franchises that have actually achieved the results that 
are claimed. Franchisors that make earnings claims must include them in the FDD, and 
the claims must “have a reasonable basis” at the time they are made. However, franchisors 
are not required to make any earnings claims at all; in fact, 60 to 70 percent of franchis
t
-
ers do not, primarily because of liability concerns about committing earnings estimates to 
writing.71
20. A table that displays systemwide statistical information about the expansion or the contrac-
tion of the franchise over the last three years. This section also includes the current number 
of franchises, the number of franchises projected for the future and the states in which 
they are to be sold, the number of franchises terminated, the number of agreements the 
franchisor has not renewed, the number of franchises that have been sold to new owners, 
the number of outlets the franchisor has repurchased, and a list of the names and addresses
(organized by state) of other franchisees in the system and of those who have left the 
system within the last year. Contacting some of the franchisees who have left the system 
can alert would-be franchisees to potential problems with the franchise.
21. The franchisor’s audited financial statements.
22. A copy of all franchise and other contracts (leases, purchase agreements, and others) that 
the franchisee will be required to sign.
23. A standardized, detachable receipt to prove that the prospective franchisee received a copy 
of the FDD. The FTC now allows franchisors to provide the FDD to prospective franchi-
sees electronically.
The typical FDD is from 100 to 200 pages long, but every potential franchisee should read 
and understand it. Unfortunately, many do not, often resulting in unpleasant surprises for fran-
chisees. The information contained in the FDD neither fully protects a potential franchise from 
deception nor guarantees success. The FDD does, however, provide enough information to begin 
a thorough investigation of the franchisor and the franchise deal, and prospective franchisees 
should use it to their advantage.
The  
 Way to Buy a Franchise
The FDD is a powerful tool designed to help would-be franchisees select the franchise that is 
right for them and to avoid being duped by dishonest franchisors. The best defenses a prospective 
entrepreneur has against unscrupulous franchisors are preparation, common sense, and patience. 
By asking the right questions and resisting the urge to rush into an investment decision, potential 
franchisees can avoid being taken by unscrupulous operators.

CHAPTER 7 • FRANCHISING AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
285
Not every franchise “horror story” is the result of dishonest franchisors. More often than not, 
the problems that arise in franchising have more to do with franchisees who buy legitimate fran-
chises without proper research and analysis. They end up in businesses that they don’t enjoy and
that they are not well suited to operate. Fortunately, most franchisees are happy with the franchise 
decision they made; 72 percent of franchisees say that if given the chance, they would choose the 
same franchise again.72 How can you avoid choosing the wrong franchise? The steps discussed
in the following sections will help you to make the right choice.
Evaluate Yourself
Before looking at any franchise, entrepreneurs should study their own traits, goals, experience, 
likes, dislikes, risk orientation, income requirements, time and family commitments, and other 
characteristics. Knowing how much you can invest in a franchise is important, but it is not the 
only factor to consider. “You not only have to understand simple things such as what kind of 
investment you’re willing to make, but also what kind of risks you are willing to take, how hard 
you want to work, how many hours you want to work, and what kind of environment you want to 
work in,” advises Lori Kiser-Block, head of franchise consulting service FranChoice.73 Will you 
be comfortable working in a structured environment? In what region of the country or world do
you want to live and work? What is your ideal job description? Do you want to sell a product or a 
service? What hours do you expect to work? Do you want to work with people, or do you prefer 
to work alone? Knowing what you enjoy doing (and what you don’t want to do) will help you to
t
narrow your search. Which franchises are a good match for your strengths, weaknesses, interests, 
and professional experience? The goal is to find the franchise that is right—for you!
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Todd and Bambi Stringham: Signs by Tomorrow After
spending 15 years in the corporate world, Todd and Bambi Stringham grew disillusioned 
and decided to make a career change. After evaluating their experience, strengths, and finances, 
they decided to make their dream of owning a business a reality by buying a franchise. The String-
hams spent months reviewing the features of more than 30 franchisors that matched their profile
of what they were looking for in a franchise before settling on Signs by Tomorrow, a Maryland-
based company with 150 outlets that makes a variety of signs, primarily for businesses. They 
wanted a franchisor that would support their operation with a solid business system and that

would allow them to use their own creativity. “I have always wanted to own my own business,”
says Todd. “After a lot of research, we found that Signs by Tomorrow had the business model and
support system we were looking for.”74 ■
Prospective franchisees also must determine how much they can invest in a franchise. 
Although the FDD shows prospective franchisees the total investment amount required, includ-
ing working capital, experts recommend that franchisees have additional cache of capital as a 
contingency fund to cover the cost of unexpected surprises. Keith Gerson, a top manager for 
FranConnect, a provider of franchise management software, points out that franchisees start 
burning through their start-up capital the day they sign their franchise contracts and that the time 
gap before they begin to generate revenue can be lengthy.75 Prospective franchisees must realize 
that despite their best plans, delays in opening a franchise often crop up, pushing back the date 
when the revenue stream begins. Having a sufficient amount of working capital (experts recom-
mend two to three times the amount the FDD lists) to keep the franchise afloat until it becomes 
cash flow positive is essential. Gerson notes that insufficient working capital is the number one
cause of franchise failure.76
Alex Gashkevich decided to leave behind a career in finance on Wall Street for the opportu-
nity to own a franchise. After months of research, he decided to invest in Aaron’s, a franchise that 
sells furniture, electronics, and appliances under lease-to-own contracts. He invested $400,000
of his own money to renovate and build out a location in Rockaway, New Jersey, and to hire 
employees. Gashkevich says that the renovations took much longer than he had planned, during 
which time he paid the employees he had already hired. His franchise reached its breakeven point 
in just 16 months, but Gashkevich has not yet paid himself a salary, choosing instead to use the
profits from his first store to open a second one. He also has signed an area development contract 
with Aaron’s under which he agrees to open Aaron’s stores in seven territories in the New York 
area. Gashkevich says that he is having an incredible amount of fun as a franchisee.77
Table 7.2 is designed to help prospective franchisees to evaluate their potential as successful
franchisees.
Research Your Market
Before shopping for a franchise, research the market in the area you plan to serve. How fast is 
the overall area growing? In which areas is that growth occurring fastest? How many competitors 
already operate in the area? How strong is the competition? Investing some time to develop a 
profile of the customers in your target area is essential; otherwise, you will be flying blind. Who 
are your potential customers? How many of them are in your proposed trading area? What are 
their characteristics? What are their income and education levels? What kinds of products and
services do they buy? What gaps exist in the market? These gaps represent potential franchise 
opportunities for you. Market research also should confirm that a franchise is not merely a fad 
that will quickly fade. Steering clear of fads and into long-term trends is one way to sustain the 
success of a franchise. Before Papa John’s Pizza allows franchisees to open a franchise, the 
company requires them to spend six months to a year evaluating the market potential of the local 
area. “We don’t just move into an area and open up 200 stores,” says one manager. “We do it one 
store at a time.”78
Consider Your Franchise Options
Small business magazines (and their Web sites), such as Entrepreneur and 
r
Inc., devote at least 
one issue to franchising in which they often list hundreds of franchises. These guides can help 
you find a suitable franchise within your price range. Another useful resource is Bond’s Franchise
Guide (Source Book Publications), which provides detailed profiles of nearly 900 North American 
franchisers and lists of franchise attorneys, consultants, and service providers. The Internet is 
another valuable tool for gathering information on franchises. The Web sites of organizations 
such as the International Franchise Association, the American Association of Franchisees 
and Dealers, the Canadian Franchise Association, and others offer valuable resources and ad-
vice for prospective franchisees. In addition, many cities host franchise trade shows through-
out the year where hundreds of franchisors gather to sell their franchises. Attending one of 

CHAPTER 7 • FRANCHISING AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
287
these franchise showcases is a convenient, efficient way to collect information about a variety of 
available opportunities.
Many franchisors offer prospective franchisees visits to corporate headquarters where they 
have the opportunity to learn more about the franchise, the people who manage it, and its prod-
ucts and services. Known as “Discovery Days,” these visits are an excellent way for prospective 
franchisees to peek behind the curtain of a franchise operation and for franchisors to size up 
potential franchisees.
TABLE 7.2 Are You Franchisee Material?
Not everyone is cut out to be a franchisee. What characteristics do successful franchise owners have?
●
Commitment. Like all entrepreneurs, successful franchisees must be committed to making their 
businesses successful. For franchisees, that means learning how the franchisor’s system works and 
how to apply it in their individual markets.
●
Learning attitude. Franchisees must exhibit a learning attitude and be willing to learn from the 
franchisor, other franchisees, and other experts. “Franchisors are not necessarily looking for experts 
in their industry,” says one franchise consultant, “but for individuals with a great work ethic, broad 
business knowledge, and a willingness to follow a proven system.”
●
Willingness to work with others. Franchising success requires a willingness to work with the 
franchisor in a close, mutually beneficial relationship.
●
Patience. Franchisees must understand that franchising is not a ticket to overnight success; success
t
often requires years of hard work.
●
Positive attitude. Franchisors look for franchisees who have a positive outlook and are focused on 
success.
●
General business skills. Although franchisors usually do not require franchisees to have years of 
experience in the particular industry in which they operate, they do look for people who have general 
business experience. Sound leadership and communication skills are important in every industry.
●
Leadership ability. Getting a franchise up and running successfully requires every ounce of 
leadership ability that a franchisee has.
●
Coachability. In addition to being successful leaders, franchisees also must be good followers. 
Franchisors say that their most successful franchisees are coachable and are willing to learn from 
the experience of others. Reaping the advantages of the franchisor’s experience is one of the primary 
benefits of franchising, and franchisees should take advantage of it. “Be prepared to listen to others 
who have blazed the path for you,” says John Hewitt, founder of the Jackson Hewitt Tax Service 
franchise.
●
Perseverance. Successful franchisees are dedicated to making their franchises successful and work 
hard to get the job done.
●
Solid people skills. Whatever field they enter, successful franchisees require good people skills 
because they will be managing employees and working with customers.
●
Adequate capital. Franchisors look for franchisees who have adequate financial resources to 
launch their businesses and to keep them going until they can generate enough cash flow to support 
themselves.
●
Compatible values. Successful franchisees have value systems that are compatible with those of the
franchisor.
●
Willingness to follow the system. Some people enter the world of franchising because they have 
an entrepreneurial streak, which could be a mistake. Although creativity and a fresh approach are 
valuable assets in any business, franchising boils down to following the system that the franchisor 
has established. Why pay a franchisor for the benefit of experience if you are not willing to put that 
experience to work for yourself?

SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Bob and Kathy Summers: Spring-Green Lawn Care
Bob and Kathy Summers traveled nearly 900 miles to the corporate headquarters of 
Spring-Green Lawn Care, a franchise they were considering purchasing. They met with a top 
executive who explained the sales that franchisees typically generate in their first year of
operation, had lunch with the office staff, and saw firsthand the equipment they would pur-
chase for their business. Their visit convinced them that Spring-Green was the right franchise
for them.79 ■
Some franchisors use technology to allow prospective franchisees to make virtual visits to 
the company’s headquarters, watch online videos, and talk with executives in videoconferences.
Get a Copy of the Franchisor’s FDD
Once you narrow your franchise choices, you should contact each franchise (at least two in the 
industry that you have selected) and get a copy of its FDD. Then read it! This document is an 
important tool in your search for the right franchise, and you should make the most of it. When 
Ali Saifi was looking for a franchise, he reviewed disclosure documents from 130 different fran-
chises before selecting Subway. Today, Saifi owns 390 Subway restaurants in South Carolina that 
employ 4,000 people and generate more than $200 million in annual sales.80 Figure 7.7 shows the
number of franchisors from which prospective franchisees solicit information before selecting a 
franchise in which to invest.
When evaluating a franchise opportunity, what should a potential franchisee look for? 
Although there is never a guarantee of success, the following characteristics make a franchise 
stand out:
● A unique concept or marketing approach. “Me-too” franchises are no more successful 
than me-too independent businesses. Franchisees of Pizza Fusion, a pizza chain with 
21 outlets based in Boca Raton, Florida, are drawn not only to the company’s vision and 
values but also to its unique position in the market, which includes a focus on fresh,
organic, and natural ingredients and eco-friendly stores and delivery vehicles. Pizza 
Fusion’s slogan is “Saving the earth, one pizza at a time.”
● Profitability. A franchisor should have a track record of profitability, and so should its fran-
chisees. If a franchisor is not profitable, its franchisees are not likely to be either. Franchisees
who follow the business format should expect to earn a reasonable rate of return.
● A registered trademark. Name recognition is difficult to achieve without a well-known 
and protected trademark.
● A business system that works. A franchisor should have in place a system that is efficient 
and is well documented in its manuals and training materials.
● A solid training program. One of the most valuable components of a franchise system is 
the training it offers franchisees. The system should be relatively easy to teach.

● Affordability. A franchisee should not have to take on an excessive amount of debt to 
purchase a franchise. Being forced to borrow too much money to open a franchise outlet 
can doom a business from the outset. Respectable franchisors verify prospective franchi-
sees’ financial qualifications as part of the screening process rather than hand out fran-
chises to anyone who has the money to buy one.
● A positive relationship with franchisees. The most successful franchises see their franchi-
sees as partners—and treat them accordingly.
The FDD covers the 23 items discussed in the previous section and includes a copy of the
company’s franchise agreement and any contracts accompanying it. Although the law requires 
an FDD to be written in plain English rather than “legalese,” it is best to have an attorney experi-
enced in franchising review the FDD and discuss its provisions with you. Watch for clauses that 
give the franchisor absolute control and discretion. The franchise contract summarizes the details 
that will govern the franchisor–franchisee relationship over its life. It outlines exactly the rights 
and the obligations of each party and sets the guidelines that govern the franchise relationship. 
Because franchise contracts typically are long term (more than 70 percent run for 10 years or 
more), it is extremely important for prospective franchisees to understand their terms before they
sign them.
One of the most revealing items in the FDD is the franchisee turnover rate, the rate at which 
franchisees leave the system. If the turnover rate is less than 5 percent, the franchise is probably 
sound. However, a double-digit franchise turnover rate is cause for concern, and one approaching
20 percent is a sign of serious underlying problems in a franchise. Satisfied franchisees are not 
inclined to leave a successful system.
Item 3, the description of the lawsuits in which the franchise has been involved, provides
valuable insight into the franchisor–franchisee relationship. Although franchise lawsuits are not 
uncommon, an unusual number of lawsuits relating to the same issue should alert a potential
franchisee to problems. For instance, a judge recently upheld a settlement concerning four class-
action lawsuits filed by more than 8,000 current or former franchisees against Quiznos Subs. The 
lawsuits involved complaints concerning the franchisor’s supply chain and food costs, market-
ing and advertising funds, and fees and royalties on territories that franchisees purchased but in 
which they never opened restaurants. Although Quiznos paid $206 million to the franchisees, the 
settlement involved no admission of wrongdoing on the franchisor’s part.81
Another important aspect of investigating a potential franchise is judging how well you fit 
into the company culture. Unfortunately, the FDD isn’t much help here. The best way to deter-
mine this is to actually work for a unit for a time (even if it’s without pay). Doing so not only 
gives prospective franchisees valuable insight into the company culture but also enables them to
determine how much they enjoy the daily activities involved in operating the franchise. “Many 
people don’t do enough research, digging into what a company is about, what they believe in, 
what they’re trying to accomplish, and whether they will fit into the culture,” says Kevin Hogan, 
a consultant who works with the Whattaburger franchise.82
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Reynolds Corea: BrightStar After Reynolds Corea was
laid off from his executive position at a large consulting firm, he decided that buying a
franchise was the best way to realize his entrepreneurial dreams. He went to work at $10 per 
hour at a local Chick-Fil-A restaurant, serving chicken sandwiches, mopping floors, and closing
the store “to get a better feel for the business.” After nine months, Corea decided that owning 
a restaurant franchise was not for him and worked with a franchise consultant to find a franchise 
that better suited his interests, goals, and skills. Corea ultimately chose to purchase a franchise 
from BrightStar, an in-home care service for senior citizens and children. Corea tapped his retire-
ment accounts for the franchise fee and start-up costs, which totaled about $200,000. Corea’s
franchise is off to a solid start, with two full-time employees and 10 part-time caregivers and
plans to hire more.83 ■
Talk to Existing Franchisees
As valuable as the FDD is, it is only a starting point for researching a franchise opportunity thor-
oughly. Perhaps the best way to evaluate the reputation of a franchisor is visit several franchise 
owners who have been in business at least one year and interview them about the positive and the
franchisee  
turnover rate
the rate at which 
franchisees leave a 
franchise system.

290
SECTION II • THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY BEGINS
negative features of the agreement and whether the franchisor delivered on its promises. Were 
their start-up costs consistent with the franchisor’s estimates in item 7 of the FDD? Do they get 
the support the franchisor promised them? Was the training the franchisor provided helpful? How 
long did it take to reach the break-even point? Have they incurred any unexpected expenses? 
What risks are involved in purchasing a franchise? Has the franchise met their expectations con-
cerning sales, profitability, and return on investment? What is involved in operating the franchise 
on a typical day? How many hours do they work in a typical week? What do they like best (and 
least) about their work? Knowing what they know now, would they buy the franchise again? 
When you are on site, note the volume of customer traffic and the average transaction size. Are 
they large enough for an outlet to be profitable? How well managed are the franchises you visit? 
Michael Whalen, who left a management position with a large office supply chain after 20 years 
to purchase a Huntington Learning Center franchise, says the most helpful part of his franchise 
evaluation process “was meeting with current franchise owners.”84 Monitoring franchisees’ blogs 
also enables prospective franchisees to learn the “real story” of running a franchise.
Another revealing exercise is to spend an entire day with at least one (preferably more) fran-
chisee to observe firsthand what it is like to operate a franchise unit. Item 20 of the FDD lists all of a 
company’s current franchisees and former franchisees who have left the system within the last year 
and their contact information, which makes it easy for potential franchisees to contact them. It is 
wise to interview former franchisees to get their perspectives on the franchiser-franchisee relation-
ship. Why did they leave the system? If their franchises were unsuccessful, what were the causes?
Table 7.3 offers a list of questions prospective franchisees should ask existing franchisees.
Ask the Franchisor Some Tough Questions
Take the time to ask the franchisor questions about the company and its relationship with its 
franchisees. As a franchisee, you will be in this relationship a long time, and you need to know 
TABLE 7.3 Questions to Ask Existing Franchisees
One of the most revealing exercises for entrepreneurs who are evaluating potential franchises is to visit 
and interview franchisees who already are operating outlets for a franchise. This is the chance to get 
the “inside scoop” from people who know best how a particular franchise system works. Following are 
some questions to ask:
1. Are you happy with your relationship with the franchisor? Explain.
2. How much control does the franchisor exercise over you and the way you run your franchise?
3. What did it actually cost you to get your franchise running? How close was the actual amount to 
the amount the franchisor told you it would cost?
4. Is your franchise profitable? How long did it take for your franchise to break even? How much
does your franchise earn? Are the earnings consistent with your expectations?
5. Did the franchisor estimate accurately the amount of working capital necessary to sustain your 
business until it began generating positive cash flow?
6. What is the training program like? Were you pleased with the training you received from the 
franchisor? Did the training prepare you adequately for operating your franchise successfully?
7. Did you encounter any unexpected franchise fees or hidden costs? If so, what were they?
8. Are you pleased with the size of your territory? Is it large enough for you to reach your sales and 
profitability goals? What kind of territorial protection does the franchisor offer?
9. What restrictions do you face on the products and services that you can sell? Are you required to 
purchase from approved suppliers? Are their prices reasonable?
10. Does the franchisor advertise as much as it said it would? Is the advertising effective in producing 
sales?
11. What kind of education and business experience do you have? How important have they been to 
your success in the franchise?
12. Given what you know now, would you purchase this franchise again?

as much about it as you possibly can beforehand. What is the franchisor’s philosophy concerning
the relationship? Is there a franchise association made up of franchisees who consult and work 
with the franchisor’s management team? What is the company culture like? How much input do 
franchisees have into the system? What are the franchise’s future expansion plans? How will they 
affect your franchise? Are you entitled to an exclusive territory? Under what circumstances can 
either party terminate the franchise agreement? What happens if you decide to sell your franchise 
in the future? Under what circumstances would you not be entitled to renew the agreement? 
What kind of earnings can you expect? (If the franchisor made no earnings claims in item 19 of 
the FDD, why not?) Does the franchisor have a well-formulated strategic plan? How many fran-
chisees own multiple outlets? (A significant percentage of multi-unit franchisees is a good sign 
that a franchise’s brand name and business system are strong.) Has the franchisor terminated any 
franchisee’s contracts? If so, why? How many franchisees have failed? What caused their failure? 
How are disputes between the franchisor and franchisees settled?
Make Your Choice
The first lesson in franchising is, “Do your homework before you get out your checkbook.” Robyn 
Vescovi left behind a 25-year career as an executive in the financial industry to become a Tasti 
D-Lite franchisee in Boynton Beach, Florida. Before making the career switch, Vescovi spent 
a year studying her franchise options before making Tasti D-Lite her final choice. “Franchising 
seemed right for me,” she says. “I learned about the board. I knew what the product could do, 
and I knew who was behind it.”85 Once you have done your research, you can make an informed 
choice about which franchise is right for you. Then it is time to put together a solid business plan
that will serve as your road map to success in the franchise you have selected. The plan is also 
a valuable tool to use as you arrange the financing for your franchise. Appendix A at the end of 
this chapter offers a checklist of questions a potential franchisee should ask before entering into 
any franchise agreement.
Trends Shaping Franchising
Franchising has experienced three major growth waves since its beginning. The first wave oc-
curred in the early 1970s when fast-food restaurants used the concept to grow rapidly. The fast-
food industry was one of the first to discover the power of franchising, but other businesses soon 
took notice and adapted the franchising concept to their industries. The second wave took place in 
the mid-1980s as the U.S. economy shifted heavily toward the service sector. Franchises followed 
suit, springing up in every service business. A third wave began in the early 1990s and continues 
today. It is characterized by new low-cost franchises that focus on specific market niches. In the 
wake of major corporate downsizing and the burgeoning costs of traditional franchises, these new 
franchises allow would-be entrepreneurs to get into proven businesses faster and at reasonable 
costs. These companies feature start-up costs in the range of about $4,000 to $250,000 and span a 
variety of industries—from leak detection in homes and auto detailing to day care and tile glazing.
Other significant trends affecting franchising are discussed in the following sections.
Changing Face of Franchisees
Franchisees today are a more diverse group than in the past. A study by the International 
Franchise Association reports that minorities own 20.5 percent of all franchises compared to 
14.2 percent of independent businesses. Although the percentage of women who own franchises 
has declined to 20.5 percent from 25 percent in 2002, the percentage of franchises jointly owned 
by women and men increased from 17.1 to 24.4 percent over the same period.86 Finding the 
necessary financing to purchase a franchise is one of the biggest obstacles minorities face. To 
encourage diversity among their franchisees, some franchisors have established programs that 
offer special discounts and financing opportunities to members of minority groups. Focus Brands, 
a company that operates several franchises, including Cinnabon, Carvel, Moe’s Southwest Grill, 
and Schlotsky’s, has a Growth Through Diversity program that gives minority franchisees 
discounts on the initial franchise fee and operating fees. Focus Brands is also one of more than
100 franchises that are members of MinorityFran, a program created by the International

Franchise Association in 2006 that has the goal of recruiting minority franchisees.87 Nearly 
60 percent of the largest 500 franchises offer similar discounts and financing opportunities to 
military veterans who want to become franchisees.88
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ronald and Ella Avery-Smothers: Burger King and
Denny’s Growing up, Ronald Smothers dreamed of owning his own business. After grad-
uating from UCLA and a short stint in the business world, Smothers opened his first franchise, a
Burger King outlet in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles. Over the next several years, 
Smothers, an African-American, opened several more Burger King stores before adding a Denny’s
restaurant to his multi-unit holdings in 2006. Ronald’s wife, Ella, also is a successful franchisee,
owning nine-and-a-half Burger King franchises. (She brought in a long-time, dedicated employee 
as co-owner of her eighth restaurant.) Ella says that she originally started working in the business 
to help her husband but then became interested in the restaurant business, which led her to pur-
chase a franchise of her own . . . and then another . . . and another. . . .89 ■
Modern franchisees also are better educated, are more sophisticated, have more business
acumen, and are more financially secure than those of just 20 years ago. People of all ages and 
backgrounds are choosing franchising as a way to get into business for themselves. Franchising 
also is attracting skilled, experienced businesspeople who are opening franchises in their second 
careers and whose goal is to own multiple outlets that cover entire states or regions. Many of 
them are former corporate managers—either corporate castoffs or corporate dropouts—looking 
for a new start on a more meaningful and rewarding career. They have the financial resources,
management skills and experience, and motivation to operate their franchises successfully. David 
Omholt, owner of a franchise brokerage company, says that former executives often make ideal 
franchisees because they exhibit financial discipline, understand how businesses grow, and are
comfortable working with in a business system.90
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Edith Kelly-Green and Lenny’s Sub Shop Edith Kelly-
Green had retired from FedEx after 30 years when her college-age daughter, Jayna, sug-
gested that she purchase a franchise of her favorite restaurant, Lenny’s Sub Shop, which is
headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. Kelly-Green knew the CEO of the company and called him 
with the idea that she would become an investor in the business. “He convinced me that I’d be
happier as a franchisee,” she recalls. Kelly-Green opened her first Lenny’s Sub Shop franchise in
Oxford, Mississippi, near the University of Mississippi. “After I opened my first unit in Oxford,
I decided I didn’t want to be a one-location owner,” she says. Today, Kelly-Green is the largest 
multi-unit owner in the chain with 10 stores in Oxford, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, and
her sons, James Kelly and Ryan Green, work with her.91 ■
International Opportunities
One of the major trends in franchising is the internationalization of American franchise systems. 
Franchising has become a major export industry for the United States, where franchises are fo-
cusing on international markets to boost sales and profits as the domestic market has become sat-
urated. “If you look at long-term growth potential, not to focus significantly on the international 
opportunity would be a big miss,” says Roland Smith, CEO of Wendy’s/Arby’s.92 Two-thirds of 
the members of the International Franchise Association say that international markets will be 
important to the future success of their franchise operations.93 Yum! Brands, the parent company 
of Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut, earns 75 percent of its revenue from international franchises.94
McDonald’s, which had restaurants in 28 countries in 1980, now operates more than 15,500 outlets
in 118 nations outside the United States; international locations account for nearly 70 percent of 
the company’s sales.95 Only 105 nations in the world, including Bermuda, Cambodia, Montenegro, 
and North Korea, do not have at least one McDonald’s restaurant.96 International markets are at-
tracting franchisors because they are growing rapidly and offer rising personal incomes, strong 
demand for consumer goods, growing service economies, and spreading urbanization. Yum! 
Brands was an early entry into China, opening its first KFC store there in 1987. Today, the 
company has nearly 4,600 KFC locations in China and opens on average one new store in China
every day.97 The company launched its first Pizza Hut in China in 1990, and the brand, which is 
regarded by Chinese customers as an upscale, trendy restaurant (often requiring reservations), 
now holds the top position in the pizza market in China.98 McDonald’s, which opened its first

CHAPTER 7 • FRANCHISING AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
293
When Aaron Miller was a student at the University of Vermont, he
wrote a business plan for a sports bar as part of an entrepreneur-
ship class he was taking. More than 15 years later, Miller, a former 
Olympic and professional ice hockey player, and Martti Matheson, 
close friends since their college days, transformed that business 
plan into reality when they opened their first Buffalo Wild Wings 
Grill and Bar franchise in Burlington, Vermont. What lessons can 
prospective franchisees learn from Miller and Matheson’s experi-
ence and that of other franchisees?
Lesson 1. Don’t be in a rush; start with a self-evaluation 
to determine whether franchising is right for you. 
Finding the right franchise can take months—sometimes years. 
The first step to finding the right franchise is not screening 
potential franchises; it is to consider whether franchising is 
the proper route for you. For would-be entrepreneurs who 
are independent and have definite ideas about how they
want their businesses to operate, franchising is not the path 
they should follow to get into business. Miller and Matheson 
considered launching their own independent sports bar but 
after evaluating their lack of experience in the restaurant 
business decided to go with a franchise because of the 
support system it offers on everything from establishing the 
menu and setting up the kitchen to advertising and choosing 
a location.
Lesson 2. Make sure that you understand both the 
advantages and the disadvantages of franchising 
before making a commitment. The best franchisors 
offer their franchisees a recipe for success and the support 
to help them make it work. “You can take your capital and
apply it to the franchise and grow quicker than you could 
on your own,” says Gary Robins, owner of 41 Supercuts 
franchises. However, franchisors require that franchisees pay 
them for the recipe with up-front fees and ongoing royalties 
and then stick to the recipe as they operate their businesses. 
“Someone who really likes their independence and doing
things their way will find franchising a very uncomfortable 
setting,” says Francine LaFontaine, a franchising expert. 
Matheson recognizes that operating a franchise can be frus-
trating because the contract restricts franchisees’ decision 
making authority on basic business issues. However, point-
ing out that the benefits that the franchisor provides far 
outweigh the costs, he says that he does not mind paying 
the 5 percent (of sales) royalty fee. The average Buffalo Wild 
Wings Grill and Bar generates $3 million in annual sales,
and Matheson knows that getting to that level of sales as
an independent restaurateur would take much longer than 
it would with a franchisor’s support.
Lesson 3. Review the FDD with the help of an 
experienced attorney. The FDD is an extremely valu-
able resource for anyone who is considering purchasing a 
franchise. Poring over the document alone can be frustrat-
ing, however, because it covers so much. “The typical FDD
is enormously complex because it is so multifaceted,” says 
Eric Karp, an attorney who teaches franchising courses at
Babson College. Karp says some franchisees are so over-
whelmed by the size of the FDD that they make the mistake
of not reading it at all.
Lesson 4. Use the FDD to screen potential franchises 
and don’t be shy about asking lots of questions. Rob
Parsons worked as the franchise development director for
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for six years before he decided to 
switch sides and become one of the company’s franchisees. 
“Something a franchisee said kept ringing in my head,” he 
recalls. “He said, ‘You did all the work. Why are you letting 
me reap all the benefits?’” Parsons, who has experienced the 
FDD from both the franchisor’s and the franchisee’s perspec-
tive, says that the FDD can be extremely useful to prospective 
franchisees. “The FDD has a list of all of the franchisees in 
a system,” says Parsons. “That’s a huge resource.” Use the 
list to contact current and past franchisees to discover what 
it’s really like to operate an outlet in the franchisor’s system. 
If they were making the decision today, would they still pur-
chase the franchise?
Lesson 5. Make sure that you can afford the franchise 
without getting in over your head. Some franchises cost 
millions of dollars; others require only a few thousand dollars. 
Prospective franchisees should know how much they can 
afford to spend on a franchise. Changes in financial markets 
have required franchisors to get more creative when it comes
to helping franchisees finance the purchase of their outlets. 
Marco’s Pizza, which operates nearly 250 restaurants, of-
fers qualified franchisees personal guarantee insurance that 
repays a bank 70 percent of a franchisee’s loan in case the 
franchisee cannot repay the loan. Marco’s also has assembled
a group of private investors to create a $5 million private
equity fund that will invest up to $100,000 in each Marco’s
restaurant. In addition, Marco’s has established a leasing
program that finances the $250,000 cost of opening one of
its pizza outlets. When Remi Tessler approached a bank for
a loan to open a Marco’s Pizza franchise in Warner Robbins, 
Georgia, the bank told him that it could finance only the cost 
of the equipment for just five years, despite his stellar credit 
score. “I was shocked,” says Tessler, who then turned to 
his franchisor for financing assistance. Tessler made a down
payment of $62,500 and used Marco’s leasing program to
finance the remaining $187,500, which he will repay over 
eight years.
Lesson 6. Visit your top franchise candidates. After nar-
rowing the list of potential franchises to your top choices, go 
visit them. Most franchisors sponsor Discovery Days events in

which they host potential franchisees at their headquarters. 
Be observant and, once again, ask lots of questions. Ted 
Dowell says his visit to the operations center of TSS Photog-
raphy, a franchise that specializes in taking photographs of 
sports, school, and special events, convinced him to become
a franchisee. Dowell was particularly impressed with the 
franchise’s production system, which is a key component 
in its franchisees’ success. He points out that that getting a
behind-the-scenes, firsthand look at the franchise’s system 
won him over as a franchisee. In addition, recognize that 
franchisors use these on-site visits to evaluate prospective
franchisees.
Lesson 7. Realize that no business, not even a franchise, 
runs itself. Some new franchisees believe that they can be 
absentee owners because the business system they purchase 
from the franchisor will allow their franchises to operate by 
themselves. It’s just not true. “Some people think that run-
ning a franchise won’t be a lot of work,” says Matt Haller of 
the International Franchise Association. “They think that all 
they have to do is pay the franchise fee and then sit back and 
watch the money roll in.” Although the franchisor provides 
franchisees with a formula for success, franchisees must 
implement the formula and make it work. “In franchising, 
like anything else, hard work pays off,” says Haller.

Hamburger University training center in Shanghai to support its expansion in China.99
As they venture into foreign markets, franchisors have learned that adaptation is one key to 
success. Although a franchise’s overall business format may not change in foreign markets, some 
of the details of operating its local outlets must. For instance, fast-food chains in other countries 
often must make adjustments to their menus to please locals’ palates. In addition to Original 
Recipe chicken, KFC restaurants in China also include an extensive menu of beef, seafood, veg-
etable, and rice dishes (spicy prawn rice and beef rice) as well as soups, breakfast items, and des-
serts (sugared egg tart) that appeal to Chinese customers’ tastes. In Japan, McDonald’s (known as
“Makudonarudo”) outlets sell teriyaki burgers, rice burgers, a bacon potato pie (mashed potatoes 
and bacon deep fried inside a pastry roll), and katsu burgers (cheese wrapped in a roast pork 
cutlet topped with katsu sauce and shredded cabbage) in addition to their traditional American 
fare. In Canada, the McDonald’s menu includes poutine, a classic comfort dish that consists of 
French fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. McDonald’s has eliminated beef and pork from 
its menu and has substituted mutton for beef in its burgers in India, a nation that is predomi-
nantly Hindu and Muslim. In India, McDonald’s sells the Maharaja Mac (two specially seasoned 
chicken patties with locally flavored condiments), the McAloo (a patty made from potatoes, peas, 
and special spices), and the McSpicy Paneer (a spicy cottage cheese patty made from buffalo 
milk topped with a tandoori sauce).100 In India, Pizza Hut restaurants offer customers a selection 
of beer and wine.101 In China, KFC quickly learned that residents were not interested in coleslaw, 
so the company dropped the item from its menu and added local delicacies, such as the Dragon 
Twister (a chicken wrap soaked in a spicy Peking duck sauce), congee (rice porridge), bamboo 
shoots, and soy milk.102
As China’s economy continues to grow and its capital markets expand, increasing numbers
of franchisors are opening locations there. In China, Subway, known as Sai Bei Wei (which trans-
lates as “tastes better than others” in Mandarin), learned the importance of patience in building 
a franchise presence in challenging international markets. When the company opened its first 
outlet in China, managers had to print signs explaining how to order a sandwich. Sales of tuna 
salad were dismal because residents, accustomed to seeing their fish whole, did not believe that 
the salad was made from fish at all. In addition, because Chinese diners do not like to touch their 
food, many of them held their sandwiches vertically, peeled the paper wrapper away gradually, 

CHAPTER 7 • FRANCHISING AND THE ENTREPRENEUR

U.S. franchises are growing faster abroad than they are in the
domestic market. As franchisors have found wringing impres-
sive growth rates from a franchise-saturated domestic market 
increasingly difficult, they have begun to export their franchises 
to international markets. Even small franchises, those with 
fewer than 100 locations, are opening outlets in global mar-
kets, including those with developing economies. Indeed,
franchising is ideally suited for developing economies because 
it allows people with limited business experience and financial 
resources to become part of an established business. China and
India, with combined populations of 2.4 billion people with ris-
ing incomes, are drawing franchisors from across the globe.
Despite the challenges it presents, Africa also is becoming the 
target of many franchisors because of its size, growing middle 
class, insatiable appetite for American brands, relative scarcity 
of franchised outlets, and economic growth. In fact, Africa is 
home to 6 of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world.
Economists forecast that the continent’s economy will grow by 
5 percent per year through 2017. Quick-service restaurant fran-
chises in particular are drawn to Africa because the World Bank
estimates that food demand across the continent will double 
between 2012 and 2020.
Initially, franchisors focused their development efforts on
Africa’s largest economy, South Africa (where franchising accounts
for 12 percent of total GDP), but many are now turning their at-
tention to Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Egypt, and Tanzania. “Africa is 
the last continent,” says Jeff Spear, vice-president of development 
for CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee’s and Carl
Jr.’s. “If we don’t start today, it will never happen.” Franchisors are 
entering African markets cautiously. McDonald’s has 177 restau-
rants in South Africa but has not expanded into other African na-
tions. Yum! Brands, owner of KFC, Long John Silver, and Taco Bell, 
has about 1,000 KFC franchises in Africa. Domino’s Pizza reports
that its five outlets in Nigeria are its busiest stores in the entire
world by sales volume. The franchisor also has more than two 
dozen restaurants in Egypt and Morocco and is making plans to 
enter South Africa and Kenya. Potential franchisees in Africa find
that the nation’s banks prefer to make loans for franchised outlets 
because they perceive the risk to be lower.
Franchising in Africa is fraught with challenges, however.
“Africa is not for sissies,” says Eric Parker, cofounder of Nando’s,
a South African chicken franchise. “You’re going to take some 
hard knocks.” One of the biggest challenges is establishing a reli-
able, consistent supply chain. To open his first four KFC franchises
in Ghana, entrepreneur Ashok Mohinani had to import chicken, 
which increased his food cost significantly, because local farmers 
could not produce enough chickens and meet the chain’s quality 
standards. When Gavin Bell, a KFC franchisee in Kenya, opened
his first outlets, the government prohibited chicken imports, so
Bell invested $500,000 into a local chicken operation, which took
13 months to get its production up to speed. Nigeria also pro-
hibits poultry imports, so the KFC restaurants there have added 
fish to their menus because local farmers cannot meet all of the 
restaurants’ demand for chicken. Getting supplies to individual 
stores can be a challenge because of the distances to refrigerated
warehouses and the limited supply of reliable refrigerated trucks 
required to keep products fresh.
Water shortages can be problematic as well. Eric Andre, a
Domino’s Pizza franchisee in Nigeria, has had to dig wells and 
install water treatment plants at a cost of $60,000 each at each
one of his five restaurants in Nigeria. Because only two of his
employees had ever tasted pizza, Andre sent his managers to 
the United States to tour pizzerias. “It is important to enter the
[African] market with your eyes wide open,” says one top govern-
ment official.
All of these challenges produce a significantly higher cost struc-
ture, often two to five times higher than franchisees in other parts of 
the world experience. For example, in the United States, tomatoes cost 
$3.45 per kilogram, but in Nigeria, the cost is $10.73 per kilogram. 
Similar cost comparisons exist for cheddar cheese ($4.12 vs.
$13.88 per kilogram), ground beef ($4.17 vs. $7.57 per kilogram), 
iceberg lettuce ($2.16 vs. $10.09 per kilogram), and other com-
modities. The result, of course, is higher menu prices. Chris 
Nahman, who left a law practice in California, to open the first
Johnny Rockets hamburger franchise in Nigeria, charges $14 for a
Rocket Single, compared to the typical $5.50 price in the United 
States. Nevertheless, Nahman says that his restaurant serves
between 300 and 400 customers a day.

and ate the contents as they would eat a banana!103 McDonald’s faced similar challenges in India, 
where customers were puzzled by placing their orders at a counter and had no understanding of 
the golden arches; the company’s signs read “McDonald’s Family Restaurant” so that customers 
would know that it was a restaurant.104
Smaller, Nontraditional Locations
As the high cost of building full-scale locations continues to climb, more franchisors are search-
ing out nontraditional locations in which to build smaller, less expensive outlets. Based on the 
principle of intercept marketing, the idea is to put a franchise’s products or services directly in 
the paths of potential customers, wherever that may be. Locations within locations have become 
popular. Franchises are putting scaled-down outlets on college campuses; in high school cafete-
rias, sports arenas, churches, hospitals, museums, and zoos; and on airline flights. Subway has 
more than 8,000 franchises in nontraditional locations that range from airports and military bases 
to college campuses and convenience stores. The company has restaurants located in a Good-
will store in Greenville, South Carolina, and inside the True Bethel Baptist Church in Buffalo, 
New York. Subway put store number 40,000 inside an AppleGreen gas station in Ipswich, 
England.105 Perhaps Subway’s most unusual location was a temporary restaurant that served only 
the construction workers building the skyscraper at 1 World Trade Center in New York City. As 
work progressed on the 105-story building, a hydraulic lift elevated the restaurant, which was 
housed inside 36 shipping containers welded together.106
Many franchisees have discovered that smaller outlets in nontraditional locations often gen-
erate more sales per square foot than full-size outlets and at just a fraction of the cost. Locations 
that emphasize convenience by being close to their customers will continue be a key to continued 
franchise growth in the market.
Conversion Franchising
The recent trend toward conversion franchising, in which owners of independent businesses be-
come franchisees to gain the advantage of name recognition, will continue. One study reports that 
72 percent of franchisors in North America use conversion franchising as a growth strategy.107
In a franchise conversion, the franchisor gets immediate entry into new markets and experienced 
operators; franchisees get increased visibility and often a big sales boost. It is not unusual for 
entrepreneurs who convert their independent stores into franchises to experience an increase of 
20 percent or more in sales because of the instant name recognition the franchise offers.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John Andikian: 7-Eleven John Andikian opened a conve-
nience store in Tustin, California, in 2004 and named it Andy’s Market in memory of his father. 
He sold typical convenience store fare, including his own version of the Slurpee, the Andy Freeze.
After 18 months in business, Andy’s Market still had not reached its break-even point, and Andikian 
was running out of cash and time. The problem: “Nobody knew what Andy’s Market was,” he says. 
To save his business, Andikian decided to convert it into a 7-Eleven franchise, paying a $20,000 franchise 
fee and $100,000 for inventory and remodeling costs. The transformation required only 48 hours, 
and Andikian noticed the dramatic difference that adding the franchisor’s well-known name made 
almost immediately. “As soon as they put the 7-Eleven sign outside, my sales doubled,” he says. 
“I was doing about $70,000 a month in sales; now I’m doing about $160,000.”108 ■
Refranchising
Another trend that has emerged over the last several years is franchises selling their company-
owned outlets to franchisees. Known as refranchising, the goal is to put outlets into the hands of 
operators, who tend to run their franchises more efficiently than the franchisor can. Since 2007,
McDonald’s has reduced the percentage of company-owned stores in the chain from 23 percent 
to 19 percent. Quick-service restaurant franchise Jack in the Box recently sold 66 of its company-
owned outlets in the Southeast and Midwest to franchisees, bringing the percentage of franchisee-
owned stores to 79 percent. The company plans to refranchise more restaurants to reach its goal 
of having 85 percent of its outlets owned by franchisees.109 Refranchising not only increases fran-
chisors’ profitability because it generates more royalty income for franchisors but also provides 
capital to finance their international expansion.

CHAPTER 7 • FRANCHISING AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
297
Multi-Unit Franchising
Twenty-five years ago, the typical franchisee operated a single outlet. The current generation of 
franchisees, however, strives to operate multiple franchise units. According to the International 
Franchise Association, 20 percent of franchisees are multiple-unit owners; however, those multi-
unit franchisees own 55 percent of all franchise outlets.110 Although the typical multiple-unit 
franchise owns five outlets, it is no longer unusual for a single franchisee to own 25, 75, or even
100 units. At Taco Bell, the Mexican fast-food restaurant chain, the typical franchisee owns 20 outlets.111
Franchisors are finding that multi-unit franchising is an efficient way to do business. For a 
franchisor, the time and cost of managing 10 franchisees each owning 10 outlets are much less 
than managing 100 franchisees each owning one outlet. A multi-unit strategy also accelerates a 
franchise’s growth rate. Not only is multiple-unit franchising an efficient way to expand quickly, 
but it also is effective for franchisors who are targeting foreign markets, where having a local 
representative who knows the territory is essential.
The popularity of multi-unit franchising has paralleled the trend toward increasingly ex-
perienced, sophisticated franchisees who set high performance goals that a single outlet cannot 
meet. For franchisees, owning multiple units offers the opportunity for rapid growth without 
leaving the safety net of the franchise. Multi-unit franchisees also earn more than single-unit 
franchisees.112 In addition, franchisees may be able to get fast-growing companies for a bargain 
when franchisors offer discounts off their standard fees for buyers who purchase multiple units.
Although operating multiple units offers advantages for both franchisors and franchisees, 
there are dangers. Operating multiple units requires franchisors to focus more carefully on select-
ing the right franchisees—those who are capable of handling the additional requirements of mul-
tiple units. The impact of selecting the wrong franchise owners is magnified when they operate 
multiple units and can create huge headaches for the entire chain. Franchisees must be aware of 
the dangers of losing their focus and becoming distracted if they take on too many units. In addi-
tion, operating multiple units means more complexity because the number of business problems
that franchisees face also is multiplied.
Area Development and Master Franchising
Driving the trend toward multiple-unit franchising are area development and master franchising.
Under an area development franchise, a franchisee earns the exclusive right to open multiple 
outlets in a specific area within a specified time. In 1973, Steve Kuhnau opened a health food 
store in New Orleans through which he sold the nutritional fruit smoothies he had developed as 
a way to combat his own food allergies. Kuhnau’s smoothies became so popular that he changed 
the company’s name to Smoothie King. Kuhnau began franchising in 1988, and today Smoothie 
King, which he sold to franchisee Wan Kim in 2012, has more than 700 locations around the 
world. To accelerate the company’s growth, Smoothie King recently signed area development 
agreements with new and existing franchisees in eight markets across the United States, ranging 
from large cities such as Chicago, Dallas, and Atlanta to small cities such as Jackson, Mississippi; 
New Haven, Connecticut; and Sarasota, Florida. As part of the area development agreements, 
these franchisees will open 28 new outlets within the next three years.113 “Franchisors are real-
izing the advantages of dealing with area developers,” says franchising expert Bret Lowell. “The 
franchisor doesn’t have to deal with six people opening six different units. There are economies of 
scale and added efficiency with area developers.”114 Some franchisors are no longer willing to sell 
individual franchises and are selling franchises only under area development deals.
A master franchise (or subfranchise) gives a franchisee the right to create a semi-independent 
organization in a particular territory to recruit, develop, and support other franchisees. A mas-
ter franchisee buys the right to develop subfranchises within a territory or sometimes an entire
country, takes over many of the duties and responsibilities of the franchisor, and typically earns 
a portion of the franchise fees and royalties from its subfranchises. Many franchisors use master 
franchising to open outlets in international markets because the master franchisees understand 
local laws and the nuances of selling in local markets. Cinnabon, a company founded by Rich and
Greg Komen in 1985 that sells cinnamon buns and other baked treats, recently signed a master 
franchise agreement to develop territories in the Republic of Georgia. To introduce its products to
Georgia, the company partnered with Sam Samuelyan and Stepan Panosyn, owners of BrandCity

cant presence in Europe and Asia, including nearby Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey, and Russia,
these outlets will be the company’s first in Georgia. Cinnabon has more than 1,000 locations in 
55 countries, including more than 130 in Russia.115 Both area development and master franchis-
ing “turbocharge” a franchisor’s growth.
Cobranding
A growing number of companies are using cobranding (or piggyback or combination) 
franchising—combining two or more distinct franchises under one roof. This “buddy-system” 
approach works best when the two franchise ideas are compatible and appeal to similar customers.
Large franchisors have used the strategy for many years, but many small franchisors are banding 
together to establish cobranded units that together create synergy and generate more sales and prof-f
its than individual, self-standing units. In 2011, Nestlé Toll House Café, which sells cookies, baked 
goods, coffee, and other treats, began creating cobranded franchises with Häagen-Dazs, which 
sells a full line of ice cream, sorbet, yogurt, and gelato. “We’re a complete dessert café,” says Dan 
Ogiba, a top manager at Häagen-Dazs. “We looked at this as an opportunity to grow and for our 
franchisees to increase their revenues.”116 Howard Taylor opened his first Nestlé Toll House Café in 
2007; today he owns five franchises, all of which are cobranded with the Häagen-Dazs brand. “The
two brands complement one another, giving our customers more options,” he says.117
Cobranded outlets also save their owners money because they lower both real estate and 
operating costs. The same employees sell both brands, reducing labor costs, and the franchisors 
share advertising, maintenance, and other costs. Focus Brands, which owns Schlotsky’s (sub
sandwiches), Cinnabon (cinnamon buns and other baked treats), and Carvel Ice Cream brands 
often pairs two and sometimes all three of its franchises in a single location. Both Schlotzky’s
and Cinnabon stores bake their products daily, which means that employees of each franchise 
already have experience with operating ovens, making it easy for them to master baking the other 
brand’s products. The cobranding strategy appears to be working; the owners of more than 200 
of Scholtsky’s 350 locations have added a Cinnabon franchise to their stores.118
Unless the brands are well-suited complements, cobranding can create more headaches than
benefits. Unless well planned and managed, cobranding can increase operational complexity 
and cause product and service quality to decline. To make sure that cobranding works for them, 
some franchisors, especially small ones, test the concept in a limited number of locations. Philly 
Pretzel Factory, with more than 100 locations, and Rita’s Frozen Ice, a franchise with more than 
600 outlets, recently partnered to open their first cobranded franchise in the Montgomery Mall in 
North Wales, Pennsylvania.119
Conclusion
Franchising has proved its viability in the U.S. economy and has become a key part of the small 
business sector because it offers many would-be entrepreneurs the opportunity to own and oper-
ate a business with a greater chance for success. Despite its impressive growth rate to date, the
franchising industry still has a great deal of room to grow. “Franchising is really small business 
at its best,” says Don DeBolt, former head of the International Franchise Association.120

Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Describe the three types of franchising: trade 
name, product distribution, and pure.
●Trade-name franchising involves a franchisee 
purchasing the right to become affiliated with a 
franchisor’s trade name without distributing its 
products exclusively.
●Product distribution franchising involves licensing
a franchisee to sell products or services under the 
franchisor’s brand name through a selective, lim-
ited distribution network.
●Pure franchising involves a selling a franchisee a 
complete business format.
2A.
Explain the benefits of buying a franchise.
●Franchises offer many benefits: management 
training and support, brand-name appeal,

standardized quality of goods and services, na-
tional advertising programs, financial assistance, 
proven products and business formats, centralized
buying power, territorial protection, and a greater 
chance of success.
2B. Explain the drawbacks of buying a franchise.
●Franchising also suffers from certain drawbacks: 
franchise fees and profit sharing, strict adherence 
to standardized operations, restrictions on purchas-
ing, limited product lines, unsatisfactory training 
programs, market saturation, and less freedom.
3. Explain the laws covering franchise 
purchases.
The FTC requires all franchisors to disclose detailed 
information on their operations in a Franchise Dis-
closure Document at the first personal meeting or at 
least 14 days before a franchise contract is signed 
or before any money is paid. The FTC rule covers
all franchisors. The FDD requires franchisors to
l
provide information on 23 topics in their disclosure 
statements. The FDD is an extremely helpful tool for 
prospective franchisees.
4. Discuss the right way to buy a franchise.
t
The following steps will help you make the right 
franchise choice: evaluate yourself, research your 
market, consider your franchise options, get a copy 
of the franchisor’s FDD, talk to existing franchisees,
ask the franchisor some tough questions, and make 
your choice.
5. Outline the major trends shaping franchising.
Key trends shaping franchising today include the 
changing face of franchisees; international franchise 
opportunities; smaller, nontraditional locations; 
conversion franchising; multiple-unit franchising; 
master franchising; and cobranding (or combination 
franchising).
Discussion Questions
7-1. What is the main difference between a franchisee 
and an independent business owner? 
7-2. Describe the three types of franchising and give an 
example of each.
7-3. Discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of 
franchising for the franchisee.
7-4. A prospective franchisee must understand the disad-
vantages of franchising before choosing this method of 
doing business. What advice can you give him for this? 
7-5. Why is a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) 
necessary? 
7-6. Discuss the right way to buy a franchise.
t
7-7. Two franchising experts recently debated the issue 
of whether new college graduates should consider 
franchising as a pathway to entrepreneurship. Jeff 
Elgin said recent college graduates are not ready 
to be franchise owners. “First, most recent college 
graduates don’t have the financial resources to fund 
a franchise start-up. Second, many lack the life 
experience and the motivation to run a business 
effectively and stick with it when times get tough.” 
Jennifer Kushell said franchising is the perfect career 
choice for many recent college graduates, for sev-
eral reasons: (1) the support system that franchising 
provides is ideal for young entrepreneurs, (2) young 
people have grown up with franchising and under-
stand it well, (3) many college graduates already have 
launched businesses of their own, and (4) they think 
big. Which view do you think is correct? Explain.
7-8. What is the difference between refranchising and 
conversion franchising? 
7-9. Describe the current trends in franchising.
7-10. One franchisee says franchising works because the 
franchisor gets its franchisees going, nurtures them, 
and, at times, shoves them. However, the franchisor 
cannot make its franchisees successful. Success de-
pends on how committed one is to finding the right 
franchise for himself or herself, on what each fran-
chisee brings to the business, and on how hard he or 
she is prepared to work. Do you agree? Explain.
7-11. Robyn Vescovi, a former financial executive who 
recently became a Tasti D-Lite franchisee, offers the 
following advice to first-time franchisees:
●Do your homework. Research the brand (both the 
long- and short-term business model)
●Know the team behind this brand and understand 
their vision for that product/business. Know them 
as franchise experts and their proven successes.
●Know yourself and your limits. This will help 
you determine the right business (e.g., new 
and innovative franchise or well-established 
franchise).
●Be involved! Don’t expect that things “will just 
happen.” You have your own business, but you
are part of something bigger, and it is in your 
best interest to participate in whatever you can 
in support of that brand/product. Don’t be an 
“absentee franchisee.”
Do you agree? Explain. What other advice can you 
offer first-time franchisees?

CHAPTER 8 • BUILDING A POWERFUL BOOTSTRAP MARKETING PLAN
303
As you learned in Chapters 4 and 5, creating a solid business model and business plan improves
an entrepreneur’s odds of building a successful company. The business model and business plan
are valuable tools that help define what an entrepreneur plans to accomplish in both quantitative
t
and qualitative terms and how he or she plans to accomplish it. The plan consolidates many of 
the topics we have discussed in preceding chapters with those in this section to produce a con-
cise statement of how an entrepreneur plans to achieve success in the marketplace. This section 
focuses on building two major components of every business plan: the marketing plan and the 
financial plan.
Too many business plans describe in great detail what entrepreneurs intend to accomplish 
(e.g., “the financials”) and pay little, if any, attention to the strategies to achieve those targets. 
Too often, entrepreneurs squander enormous effort pulling together capital, people, and other 
resources to sell their products and services because they fail to determine what it will take to at-
tract and keep a profitable customer base. Sometimes they fail to determine whether a profitable 
customer base even exists! To be effective, a solid business plan must contain both a financial
plan and a marketing plan. Like the financial plan, an effective marketing plan projects numbers
d
and analyzes them but from a different perspective. Rather than focus on cash flow, net income, 
and owner’s equity, a marketing plan concentrates on the customer.
This chapter is devoted to creating an effective marketing plan, which is a subset of a total 
business plan. Before producing reams of computer-generated spreadsheets of financial projec-
tions, an entrepreneur must determine what to sell, to whom and how, and on what terms and 
at what price and how to get the product or service to the customer. In short, a marketing plan 
identifies a company’s target customers and describes how that business will attract and keep
them. Its primary focus is cultivating and maintaining a competitive edge for a small business. 
Table 8.1 explains how to build a seven-sentence bootstrap (also sometimes called “guerrilla”) 
marketing strategy.
Building a Bootstrap Marketing Plan
Marketing is the process of creating and delivering desired goods and services to customers and
involves all of the activities associated with winning and retaining loyal customers. The “secret” 
to successful marketing is to understand what your target customers’ needs, demands, and wants
are before your competitors can; to offer them the products and services that will satisfy those 
needs, demands, and wants; and to provide customer service, convenience, and value so that they 
will keep coming back.
The marketing function cuts across the entire company, affecting every aspect of its 
operation—from finance and production to hiring and purchasing—as well as the company’s 
ultimate success. As competition for customers becomes more intense, entrepreneurs must un-
derstand the importance of developing creative marketing strategies. Their success and survival 
depend on it. Traditional marketing techniques emphasize pushing messages out to potential
customers. However, modern technology gives consumers the ability to filter and block many of 
these messages, limiting the effectiveness of “push” techniques. Successful entrepreneurs rec-
ognize that modern marketing strategies also must include techniques such as social media and 
cause marketing that pull customers into their companies’ sphere of influence. The good news is
that many of these “pull” strategies are relatively inexpensive and, when infused with a healthy 
dose of creativity, are extremely effective.
Although they may be small and cannot match their larger rivals’ marketing budgets, entrepre-
neurial companies are not powerless when it comes to developing effective marketing strategies. 
By using bootstrap marketing strategies—unconventional, low-cost, creative techniques—small
companies can wring as much or more “bang” from their marketing bucks. For instance, facing 
the power of discount giants such as Wal-Mart, Target, and “category killer” superstores such as 
Best Buy and Home Depot that are determined to increase their market shares, small retail shops 
are turning to bootstrap marketing tactics to attract new customers and to keep existing ones. Jay 
Conrad Levinson, the late guerrilla and bootstrap marketing guru, said bootstrap marketing is all 
about maximizing the efficiency of a small company’s marketing budget.
An effective bootstrap marketing campaign does not require an entrepreneur to spend large 
t
amounts of money, but it does demand creativity, ingenuity, and an understanding of customers’

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
TABLE 8.1 A Seven-Sentence Bootstrap (Guerrilla) Marketing Strategy
Building a successful bootstrap marketing plan does not have to be complex. Bootstrap marketing expert 
Jay Conrad Levinson advised entrepreneurs to create a bootstrap marketing plan with just seven sentences:
1. What is the purpose of your marketing? In other words, what action do you want customers or 
prospective customers to take as a result of your marketing efforts? Should they visit your store?
Go to your company’s Web site? Call a toll-free number for more information?
2. What primary benefit can you offer customers? What is your company’s competitive advantage, 
and what does it do for customers? Bootstrap marketers express their companies’ competitive
advantage as a solution to a customer’s problem, which is easier to market than just a positive 
benefit. Successful bootstrap marketing requires an entrepreneur to have a clear understanding of 
a company’s unique selling proposition, a key customer benefit of a product or service that sets it 
apart from its competition.
3. Who is your target market? At whom are you aiming your marketing efforts? Answering this 
question often requires some basic research about your target customers, their characteristics, 
their habits, and their preferences. Bootstrap marketers know that broadcasting is old school; 
they realize that narrowcasting—focusing their marketing efforts on those people who are most 
interested in and are likely to purchase their goods and services—is much more efficient and 
effective. Most small companies have more than one target market; be sure to identify all of them.
4. Which marketing tools will you use to reach your target audience? This list should include only 
those tools your company understands, knows how to use effectively, and can afford. The good 
news is that marketing tools do not have to be costly to be effective. In fact, bootstrap marketers 
are experts at using low-cost methods to market their companies.
5. What is your company’s niche in the marketplace? How do you intend to position your company 
against your competition? Bootstrap marketers understand that their markets are crowded with 
competitors, some of them much larger with gigantic marketing budgets that dwarf their own, and
that finding a profitable niche to occupy can be highly profitable. Recall from Chapter 4 that many 
successful entrepreneurs position their companies in profitable niches. One insurance agent markets his 
agency as specializing in serving the needs of small businesses. It’Sugar, a company founded in 2006 
by Jeff Rubin, a veteran of the candy industry, sells many types of candy, ranging from Jelly Belly jelly 
beans to five-pound Hershey chocolate bars through its Web site and its 70 retail stores. Not a typical 
candy store aimed at children, It’Sugar stores mainly target adults and resemble Victoria’s Secret 
shops, with mannequins dressed in candy, unique displays, and vibrant colors. Like It’Sugar, the key is 
to carve out a position that allows your company to differentiate itself from all of its competitors.
6. What is your company’s identity in the marketplace? A company’s identity is a reflection of 
its personality, its DNA. Small companies often have an advantage over large businesses when 
it comes to communicating their identities because of the interesting, unique stories behind their 
creation and the enthusiasm and passion of their founders. Customers enjoy doing business 
with small companies that have a clear, meaningful, and compelling identity in the marketplace. 
Southwest Airlines built its business by attracting customers who were drawn to its fun-loving, 
somewhat irreverent culture and its reputation for taking care of its customers.
7. How much money will you spend on your marketing? What is your marketing budget? 
Entrepreneurs should decide how much they intend to invest in their marketing efforts, an 
amount usually expressed as a percentage of sales. The average company in the United States
devotes 4 percent of its sales revenue to marketing. Small companies should allocate a portion of 
their budget to marketing; after all, it drives sales. The good news is that many of the bootstrap
marketing techniques that small companies can use (and that are described in this chapter) are 
either low cost or no cost. When allocating their budgets, bootstrap marketers recognize the 
importance of putting their money where they will get the greatest “bang.”
Answering these seven questions will give you an outline of your company’s marketing plan. 
Implementing a bootstrap marketing plan boils down to two essentials:
1. Having a thorough understanding of your target market, including what customers want and expect 
from your company and its products and services.
2. Identifying the obstacles that stand in your way of satisfying customers (competitors, barriers to 
entry, processes, outside influences, budgets, knowledge, and others) and eliminating them.

buying habits. Levinson estimated that bootstrap marketers spend between 4 percent and 8 per-
cent of sales on marketing, but they put their money into clever, creative marketing efforts that 
reach their target customers and raise the profile of their products, services, and companies.1
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Kimberly Causey: Home Décor Press After spending 
ten years working in the wholesale home furnishings industry, Kimberly Causey realized 
consumers wanted information on home furnishing bargains. She took her knowledge of the in-
dustry and set out to self-publish a home furnishings buying guide. Causey could not afford to get 
her guide professionally printed, so she made her first run of books in her kitchen. She printed the 
interior pages on her home printer, folded them by hand, and glued them inside professionally 
printed covers using a glue gun and a butter knife. She promoted the books by driving all over the 
Southeast to appear on local morning television shows. Causey used the profits from her home-
made books to buy a professionally printed run of books and an RV and began promoting her 
books across the country. She was able to secure a nationwide contract with Barnes & Noble. Her 
story eventually caught the attention of the Today show. Her appearance on that show pushed 
her book to a top 10 title on Amazon. Causey continues to promote her books through appear-
ances on both local and national media outlets.2 ■
A sound bootstrap marketing plan reflects a company’s understanding of its customers and 
acknowledges that satisfying them is the foundation of every business. It recognizes that the 
customer is the central player in the cast of every business venture. According to marketing ex-
pert Ted Levitt, the primary purpose of a business is not to earn a profit; instead, it is to identify 
and attract customers. If an entrepreneur focuses on this purpose and uses good sense to run the 
business, profits will follow.3 In other words, profits are the outcome of creating value for your 
target customers. Every area of the business must practice putting the customer first in planning 
and actions.
A bootstrap marketing plan should accomplish three objectives:
1. It should pinpoint the specific target markets the small company will serve.
2. It should determine customer needs and wants through market research.
3. It should analyze the firm’s competitive advantages and build a bootstrap marketing strat-
egy around them to communicate its value proposition to the target market.
This chapter focuses on these three objectives of the small company’s marketing plan.
Pinpointing the Target Market
One of the first steps in building a bootstrap marketing plan is to identify a small company’s 
target market—the specific group of customers at whom the company aims its goods or ser-
vices. The more a business knows about its local markets and its customers and their buying
habits and preferences, the more precisely it can focus its marketing efforts on the group(s) of 
customers who are most likely to buy its products or services. Most marketing experts contend 
that the greatest marketing mistake small businesses make is failing to define clearly the target 
markets they serve. These entrepreneurs develop new products that do not sell because they are 
not targeted at a specific audience’s needs. They broadcast ads that attempt to reach everyone 
and end up reaching no one. They spend precious time and money trying to reach customers who 
are not the most profitable, and many of the customers they attract leave because they do not 
know what the company stands for. Why, then, do so many small companies make this mistake?
Because it is easy and does not require market research or a marketing plan! Smart entrepre-
neurs know they do not have the luxury of wasting resources. They must follow a more focused, 
laserlike approach to marketing. Entrepreneurs must identify a specific market niche that has a 
specific need or “pain point” and tailor a solution, be it a product or a service, to address this 
need. As you learned in Chapter 4, an effective value proposition offers a specific solution to 
a specific market segment. “It is amazing how many people assume they know what custom-
ers want without actually asking customers,” says Hunter Phillips, CEO, PRSM Healthcare in
Nashville, Tennessee. “Present it as if you are trying to solve a problem for them. Remember, this 
is about their needs rather than your idea.”4

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
To be customer driven, an effective marketing strategy must be based on a clear, comprehen-
sive understanding of a company’s target customers and their needs. A customer-driven market-
ing strategy is a powerful weapon for any company that lacks the financial and physical resources 
of its competitors. Customers respond when companies take the time to learn about their unique 
needs and offer products and services designed to satisfy them.

comfortable and designed to make quick shots easier. Using parts purchased at a hardware store, 
Henry constructed a strap that allowed his camera to hang comfortably at his side until he was
ready to take a photograph, when it would glide quickly and easily into place. Henry borrowed 
$5,000 from a friend to launch BlackRapid to produce and sell camera straps based on his new
design. At first Henry bought banner ads at wedding Web sites to promote his camera straps. 
However, that proved to be an expensive strategy that resulted in very few sales. Henry changed 
his strategy to promoting BlackRapid through photography blogs. He sent each blogger a free
strap hoping that they would spread the word about his product. The strategy worked. After only 
four years in business, BlackRapid’s revenues grew to more than $6 million a year.5 ■
Most successful businesses have well-defined portraits of the customers they are seeking to 
attract. From market research, they know their customers’ income levels, lifestyles, buying pat-
terns, likes and dislikes, and even their psychological profiles—why they buy. These companies 
offer prices that are appropriate to their target customers’ buying power, product lines that appeal 
to their tastes, and service they expect. The payoff comes in the form of higher sales, profits, 
and customer loyalty. For entrepreneurs, pinpointing target customers has become more impor-
tant than ever before as markets in the United States have become increasingly fragmented and 
diverse. Mass marketing techniques no longer reach customers the way they did 30 years ago 
because of the splintering of the population and the influence exerted on the nation’s purchasing 
patterns by what were once minority groups such as Hispanic, Asian, and African Americans (see 
Figure 8.1). Peter Francese, marketing consultant and author of the research report 2010 America, 
says “the average American” no longer exists.6 The United States is a multicultural nation in

which no race or ethnicity comprises a majority in its two most populous states, California and
Texas. In addition, racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 92 percent of the population growth 
in the United States between 2000 and 2010.7 The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that whites will
no longer constitute the majority in America by 2043.8 By 2020, baby boomers’ spending will be 
in decline, the most economically disadvantaged market segments will expand, and household 
spending will grow at a slow pace, all of which will create a very different world for marketers.9
When companies follow a customer-driven marketing strategy, they ensure that their target 
customers permeate the entire business—from the merchandise sold and the music played on the
sound system to the location, layout, and decor of the store. These entrepreneurs have an advan-
tage over their larger rivals because the buying experience they create resonates with their target 
customers. That’s why they prosper.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Orlin Sorensen and Brett Carlile: Woodinville Whiskey 
Company The WoodinvilleWhiskey Company, a microdistillery in Woodinville, Washington,
founded by Orlin Sorensen and Brett Carlile, builds relationships with its customers by putting 
them to work. Customers help bottle, label, cork, and case whiskey. During the nightly bottling
parties, the company gives 16 customers T-shirts, food, and discounts on any whiskey they buy that 
evening in return for their efforts. The bottling parties are posted on the company’s Facebook 
page, where the listed parties fill up within a few minutes of posting. Sorenson says the bottling 
parties build brand awareness and increase customer loyalty. Although it would be less expensive
to hire employees to do the bottling, the company has no plans to abandon the parties. The rela-
tionship the company has built with its customers far offsets the higher costs associated with the
bottling party method of production.10 ■
Determining Customer Needs and Wants  
through Market Research
The changing nature of the U.S. population is a potent force altering the landscape of business. 
Shifting patterns in age, income, education, race, and other population characteristics (which are 
the subject of demographics) have a major impact on new opportunities in the market and on 
existing small businesses. Entrepreneurs who ignore demographic trends and fail to adjust their 
strategies accordingly run the risk of becoming competitively obsolete. Entrepreneurs who stay in 
tune with demographic, social, and economic trends are able to spot growing and emerging market 
opportunities.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jennifer Lopez: Viva Móvil Celebrity Jennifer Lopez 
started the mobile phone reseller, Viva Móvil, to target the growing Latino market. In ad-
dition to its online store, Viva Móvil operates brick and mortar locations in New York City, Los
Angeles, and Miami. The stores promise a retail experience that caters to the Latino market. Each
store has a PlayStation to keep children entertained while their parents shop for new phones and 
accessories. All employees are bilingual, and the stores offer accessories designed by Lopez to go
along with the iPhones and Samsung phones offered through a partnership with Verizon.11 ■
A demographic trend is like a train: A business owner must find out early on where it’s going and 
decide whether to get on board. Waiting until the train is roaring down the tracks and gaining speed 
means it’s too late to get on board. However, by checking the schedule early and planning ahead, 
an entrepreneur may find himself or herself at the train’s controls wearing the engineer’s hat!
Similarly, small companies that spot demographic trends early and act on them can gain a distinc-
tive edge in the market. An entrepreneur’s goal is to make sure that his or her company’s market-
ing plan is on track with the most significant trends that are shaping the industry. Trend tracking 
not only keeps a company on the pathway to success but also helps it avoid losing its focus by 
pursuing opportunities that are out of favor.
Trends are powerful forces and can be an entrepreneur’s greatest friend or greatest foe. For 
entrepreneurs who are observant and position their companies to intercept them, trends can be 
to their companies what the perfect wave is to a surfer. For entrepreneurs who ignore them or 
discount their importance, trends can leave their companies stranded like a boat stuck in the mud 
at low tide.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Juan Diego Calle was born into an entrepreneurial family in Bogota,
Colombia. His parents owned and operated a highly successful
wine and beer distribution company. Because of political instability 
in Colombia, his parents became increasingly worried about the 
safety of their family. When he was 15 years old, his parents moved 
Juan and his siblings to Miami. However, his parents chose to stay 
behind in Colombia to manage the family business.
In 1998 while in college, Calle studied abroad in France. There 
he became intrigued by the opportunity offered by the Internet.
When he returned to Miami, Calle launched an Internet-based 
business that failed when the Internet bubble burst in 2001. How-
ever, Calle continued to pursue Internet-related businesses after 
the failure of his first endeavor. He had great success with a busi-
ness that acquired and developed travel domains that matched 
keywords, such as New York Hotels and London Hotels.
While growing his domain name business, Calle recog-
nized that available domain names ending in .com extensions
were becoming scarce. A friend suggested he look into .co ex-
tension, which was the domain name designation for his native
country of Colombia. After many false starts, Calle was able
to convince the government of Colombia to accept his bid to 
manage the .co extension through his new company called .CO
Internet S.A.S.
Calle made the decision to brand the .co extension as a place
for start-ups to build their Internet presence. Calle was able to
convince trend-setting tech companies to use the .co extension for 
their Web presence. To achieve his goal, he persuaded executives
at Twitter to adopt t.co as its shortened URL address in Colombia. 
Calle also sold AngelList, the service for connecting entrepreneurs 
and angel investors, the domain name Angel.co as its Internet ad-
dress. By associating the .co brand with successful ventures such 
as these, .CO Internet helped reinforce its branding efforts as the
domain of choice for tech start-ups.
The company seeks to position its brand as having more value
than just a URL address. .CO Internet offers all businesses that 
adopt the .co extension “membership,” which includes discounts
on books and admission to events and forums to connect with 
other entrepreneurs. To measure the success of its branding ef-
forts, the company conducted a survey after it had been operating 
for only one year. The results indicated that 80 percent of people 
thought .co meant “company,” while only 3 percent identified it 
with the country of Colombia
.CO Internet has more than 1.6 million domain names under man-
agement in 200 countries, with revenues of more than $21 million.
In 2014, Neustar, a publicly-traded company specializing in Internet 
analytics, agreed to purchase .CO Internet S.A.S. for $109 million.

The Value of Market Research
By performing some basic market research, aspiring entrepreneurs and owners of existing small
business can detect key demographic and market trends. Marketing consultants argue that infor-
mation is just as much a business asset as equipment, machinery, and inventory. Market research
is the vehicle for gathering the information that serves as the foundation for the marketing plan. 
It involves systematically collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data pertaining to a company’s

market, customers, and competitors. The objective of market research is to learn how to improve 
the level of satisfaction for existing customers and to find ways to attract new customers.
Small companies cannot afford to make marketing mistakes because there is little margin 
for error when funds are scarce and budgets are tight. Small businesses simply cannot afford to 
miss their target markets, and market research can help them zero in on the bull’s-eye. Market 
research does not have to be time consuming, complex, or expensive to be useful. By applying
t
the same type of creativity to market research that they display when creating their businesses,
entrepreneurs can perform effective market research “on the cheap.”
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John Lusk: Rivet & Sway Before John Lusk launched the 
designer eyewear company, Rivet & Sway, he and his team spent evenings and weekends 
conducting market research. They were seeking to identify specific problems that women have 
when they shop for eyewear. The founding team went through industry reports; interviewed opti-
cians, optometrists, and eyewear boutique owners; conducted surveys of the many people they 
had all built up in their personal social and professional networks; conducted bootstrap focus 
groups; and engaged in extensive competitive research. The company’s budget for all of the 
market research was less than $5,000, with most of that being spent on buying a high quality
industry report.12 ■
Established companies also can conduct market research on the cheap. Ron Shaich, founder 
of Panera Bread, a chain of bakery cafés with 1,185 locations in 40 states, still visits stores regu-
larly, where he works the cash registers and serves customers so that he can listen to their ideas
and concerns.13 Hands-on market research techniques such as these allow entrepreneurs to get 
past the barriers that consumers often put up and to uncover their true preferences and hidden 
thoughts.
Many entrepreneurs are discovering the power, the speed, the convenience, and the low cost 
of conducting market research over the Internet. Online surveys, customer opinion polls, and 
other research projects are easy to conduct, cost virtually nothing, and help companies to connect 
with their customers. With online surveys, businesses can get real-time feedback from custom-
ers, often using surveys they have designed themselves. Web sites such as Survey Monkey and 
Zoomerang allow entrepreneurs to conduct low-cost (sometimes free) online surveys of existing 
or prospective customers. Many companies are using social media sites such as Facebook and 
Twitter as market research tools. Entrepreneurs can use surveys and social media to gain insight 
into the market that used to require hiring a marketing research consultant.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Luca Daniel Lavorato and Mario Christian: Joseph
Nogucci Joseph Nogucci, an online jewelry store and manufacturer founded by Luca Daniel
Lavorato and Mario Christian, uses Facebook to generate customer reactions to new product offer-
ings. The company gauges customer interest in new designs before it puts them into production. 
The customer feedback also helps the company determine how much inventory to carry and what 
demographic to target market with each of its new product offerings. In addition to promoting and 
managing inventory for new products, the company posts inspirational stories from customers on 
its Facebook fan page to build customer loyalty. Joseph Nogucci has 75,000 Facebook fans and de-
votes 80 percent of its marketing budget to Facebook. The company also connects with customers
through Twitter, Instagram, and other social media.14 ■
Faith Popcorn, a marketing consultant, encourages small business owners to be their own 
“trend-tracking sleuths.” Merely by observing their customers’ attitudes and actions, small busi-
ness owners can shift their product lines and services to meet changing tastes in the market. To
spot significant trends, Popcorn suggests the following:15
● Read as many current publications as possible, especially ones you normally would not read.
● Watch the top 10 television shows because they are indicators of consumers’ attitudes and
values and what they’re going to be buying.
● See the top 10 movies. They also influence consumer behavior, from language to fashion.
● Talk to at least 150 customers a year. Make a conscious effort to spend time with some of 
your target customers, preferably in an informal setting, to find out what they are thinking. 

310
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Start by asking them two important questions: “Will you buy from us again?” and “Will 
you recommend us to your friends?”
● Talk with the 10 smartest people you know. They can offer valuable insights and fresh per-
spectives you may not have considered.
● Listen to your children or younger siblings.
Next, entrepreneurs should make a list of the major trends they spot and should briefly de-
scribe how well their products or services match these trends. Companies whose products or ser-
vices are diverging from major social, demographic, and economic trends rather than converging 
with them must change their course or run the risk of failing because their markets can evaporate 
before their eyes. How can entrepreneurs find the right match among trends, their products or 
services, and the appropriate target markets? Market research!
How to Conduct Market Research
The goal of market research is to reduce the risks associated with making business decisions.
For the entrepreneur, there is no bigger decision than the one to start or not start a new business. 
Market research can replace misinformation and assumptions with facts. Opinion and hearsay 
are not viable foundations on which to build a solid marketing strategy. Remember, this is a key
aspect of developing a sound business model (see Chapter 4). Successful market research con-
sists of four steps: define the problem, collect the data, analyze and interpret the data, and draw
conclusions, including how you may need to pivot your business model.
Step 1. Define the objective. The first—and most crucial—step in market research is to 
define the research objective clearly and concisely. For a new business, the objec-
tive is to test the assumptions made while developing the business model. For 
an existing business, the objective is to better understand changes occurring in 
its business or in its market. A common error at this stage is to confuse a symp-
tom with the true problem. For example, dwindling sales is not a problem; it is a 
symptom. To get to the heart of the matter, entrepreneurs must list all the possible 
factors that could have caused it. Do we face new competition? Are our sales rep-
resentatives impolite or unknowledgeable? Have customer tastes changed? Is our 
product line too narrow? Do customers have trouble finding what they want? Is 
our Web site giving customers what they want? Is it easy to navigate?
Step 2. Collect the data. The marketing approach that dominates today is individualized 
(one-to-one) marketing, which involves gathering data on individual customers
and then developing a marketing program designed specifically to appeal to their 
needs, tastes, and preferences. In a society in which people feel so isolated and in-
teractions are so impersonal, one-to-one marketing gives a business a competitive
edge. Companies following this approach know their customers, understand how
to give them the value they want, and, perhaps most important, know how to make 
them feel special and valued. The idea is to treat each customer as an individual, 
and the goal is to transform a company’s best and most profitable customers into 
loyal, lifetime customers.
Individualized marketing requires business owners to gather and assimilate detailed infor-
mation about their customers. Fortunately, owners of even the smallest companies now have ac-
cess to affordable technology that creates and manages computerized databases, allowing them 
to develop close, one-to-one relationships with their customers. Much like gold nuggets waiting 
to be discovered, significant amounts of valuable information about customers and their buying 
habits are hidden inside many small businesses, tucked away in computerized databases. For 
most business owners, collecting useful information about their customers and potential new 
products and markets is simply a matter of sorting and organizing data that are already floating 
around somewhere in their companies.
The key is to mine the data that most companies have at their disposal and turn them into 
useful information that allows the company to “court” its customers with special products, ser-
vices, ads, and offers that appeal most to them. How can entrepreneurs gather valuable market and

customer information? Two basic methods are available: conducting primary research, data you 
collect and analyze yourself, and gathering secondary research, data that have already been com-
piled and that are available, often at a reasonable cost or even free. Primary research techniques 
include the following:
● Customer surveys and questionnaires. Keep them short. Word your questions carefully so 
that you do not bias the results and use a simple ranking system (e.g., a 1-to-5 scale, with 
1 representing “unacceptable” and 5 representing “excellent”). Test your survey for prob-
lems on a small number of people before putting it to use. Online surveys are inexpensive,
are easy to conduct, and provide feedback fast. VerticalResponse, a self-service marketing 
firm for small businesses, regularly sends out e-mail surveys to its customers. Because the
company relies on word-of-mouth for much of its new business, knowing what its cus-
tomers like and don’t like about how they are doing business and the products it offers is 
critical to adding new customers.16
● Focus groups. Enlist a small number of customers to give you feedback on specific issues
in your business—quality, convenience, hours of operation, service, and so on. Listen care-
fully for new marketing opportunities as customers or potential customers tell you what is 
on their minds. Once again, consider using the Internet; one small bicycle company con-
ducts 10 online focus groups each year at virtually no cost and gains valuable marketing 
information from them.
● Social media conversations and monitoring. With social media, companies have the
opportunity to engage in direct conversations with their customers. In addition, monitor-
ing social media for comments about a business and its products or services can provide 
useful feedback from customers. Many companies use the Google Alerts feature of the 
leading search engine to track and receive e-mail updates whenever someone writes about 
their brands online. Most social networking sites, including Facebook and Twitter, offer 
search features that allow users to track what people are saying about a company and its 
products or services. Shari’s Berries ships more than 5 million gourmet berries every 
Valentine’s Day. When the weather forecast showed that a major snow storm would be 
sweeping across the country on Valentine’s Day, the company proactively e-mailed custom-
ers and sent messages on Twitter warning of delivery delays. As the storm hit, the company 
monitored Facebook and Twitter, responding to every customer who posted comments. 
Although there was quite a bit of negative chatter in social media about the company when 
the storm first hit, within four days positive comments significantly outnumbered negative 
comments throughout social media.17
● Test market. One of the best ways to gauge customer response to a new product or service 
is to set up a test market. When Smooth Fitness launched its new unobtrusive, low-cost 
exercise bicycle designed for aging baby boomers, the company test-marketed the new 
product on QVC. The company sold 33,000 bikes in one day on QVC, which convinced 
its managers that the new product would be successful.18
● Daily transactions. Sift as much data as possible from existing company records and daily 
transactions—customer warranty cards, personal checks, frequent-buyer clubs, credit ap-
plications, and others.
● Other ideas. Set up a suggestion system (for customers and employees) and use it. Estab-
lish a customer advisory panel to determine how well your company is meeting needs. Talk 
with suppliers about trends they have spotted in the industry. Contact customers who have
not bought anything in a long time and find out why. Contact people who are not customers
and find out why. Teach employees to be good listeners and then ask them what they hear.
Secondary research, which is usually less expensive to collect than primary data, includes the 
following sources:
● Business directories. To locate a trade association, use Business Information Sources
(University of California Press) or the Encyclopedia of Associations (Gale Research). To 
find suppliers, use the Thomas Register of American Manufacturers (Thomas Publishing 

312
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Company) or Standard & Poor’s Register of Corporations, Executives, and Industries
(Standard & Poor’s Corporation). The American Wholesalers and Distributors Directory
includes details on more than 18,000 wholesalers and distributors.
● Direct mail lists. You can buy mailing lists for practically any type of business. The 
Standard Rates and Data Service Directory of Mailing Lists (Standard Rates and Data) 
is a good place to start looking.
● Demographic data. Profiles of more specific regions are available in the State and 
Metropolitan Data Book (Government Printing Office). The
k
Sourcebook of ZIP Code 
Demographics (CACI, Inc.) provides detailed breakdowns of the population in every ZIP 
code in the country. Sales and Marketing Management’s Survey of Buying Power (Bill 
r
Communications) has statistics on consumer, retail, and industrial buying.
● Census data. The Bureau of the Census publishes a wide variety of reports that summarize 
the wealth of data found in its census database, which is available at most libraries and at 
the Census Bureau’s Web site (www.census.gov).
● Forecasts. The U.S. Global Outlook tracks the growth of 200 industries and gives a five-
k
year forecast for each one. Many government agencies, including the U.S. Department 
of Commerce, offer forecasts on everything from interest rates to the number of housing 
starts. A government librarian can help you find what you need.
● Market research. Someone may already have compiled the market research you need. 
The FINDex Worldwide Directory of Market Research Reports, Studies, and Surveys
(Cambridge Information Group) lists more than 10,600 studies available for purchase. 
Other directories of business research include the Simmons Study of Media and Markets
(Simmons Market Research Bureau Inc.) and the A. C. Nielsen Retail Index (A. C. Nielsen
x
Company).
● Articles. Magazine and journal articles pertinent to your business are a great source of 
information. Use the Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature, the Business Periodicals 
Index (similar to the
x
Reader’s Guide but focusing on business periodicals), and Ulrich’s 
Guide to International Periodicals to locate the ones you need.
● Local data. Your state department of commerce and your local chamber of commerce will
very likely have useful data on the local market of interest to you. Call to find out what is 
available.
● The Internet. Most entrepreneurs are astounded at the marketing information that is avail-
able on the Internet. Using one of the search engines, you can gain access to a world of 
information—literally!
Thanks to advances in computer hardware and software, data mining, once available only to 
large companies with vast computer power and large market research budgets, is now possible for 
even very small businesses. Data mining is a process in which computer software that uses sta-
tistical analysis, database technology, and artificial intelligence finds hidden patterns, trends, and 
connections in data so that business owners can make better marketing decisions and predictions
about customers’ behavior. By finding relationships among the many components of a data set,
identifying clusters of customers with similar buying habits, and predicting customers’ buying 
patterns, data mining gives entrepreneurs incredible marketing power.
Step 3. Analyze and interpret the data. The results of market research alone do not 
provide a solution to the problem; business owners must interpret them. What do 
the data tell you? Is there a common thread running through the responses?
Do the results suggest any changes needed in the way the business operates?
Can the entrepreneur can take advantage of new opportunities? There are no
hard-and-fast rules for interpreting market research results. Entrepreneurs must 
use judgment and common sense to determine what the results of their 
research mean.

Step 4. Draw conclusions and act. The market research process is not complete until the 
business owner acts on the information collected. In many cases, the conclusion is
obvious once a small business owner interprets the results of the market research. 
Based on an understanding of what the facts really mean, the owner must then de-
cide how to use the information in the business. For example, the owner of a small 
ladies’ clothing boutique discovered from a survey that her customers preferred
evening shopping hours over early morning hours. She made the schedule adjust-
ment, and sales began to climb.
Plotting a Bootstrap Marketing Strategy:  
How to Build a Competitive Edge
To be successful bootstrap marketers, entrepreneurs must be as innovative in creating their mar-
keting strategies as they are in developing new product and service ideas. Table 8.2 describes 
several low-cost, creative, and highly effective bootstrap marketing tactics small businesses have
used to outperform their larger rivals.
Bootstrap Marketing Principles
The following 14 principles can help business owners create powerful, effective bootstrap mar-
keting strategies.
FIND A NICHE AND FILL IT As you learned in Chapter 4, many successful small companies choose 
their niches carefully and defend them fiercely rather than compete head-to-head with larger 
rivals. A focus (niche) strategy allows a small company to maximize the advantages of its size and
to compete effectively even in industries dominated by giants by serving its target customers better 
than its competitors. Focusing on niches that are too small to be attractive to large companies is a 
common recipe for success among thriving small companies.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Craig Rowe: ClearRisk ClearRisk, founded by Craig Rowe, 
is a St. Johns, Newfoundland, company that develops risk and claims management apps for 
government entities and insurance companies around the globe. The company operates in a
geographically diverse business-to-business market and relies on social media to reach customers 
within its narrowly defined niche strategy. The company uses Facebook to connect with its clients
and its potential customers and does not use hard sell tactics with social media. Instead, ClearRisk 
uses Facebook to disseminate valuable information to its niche market. It uses the contacts it gener-
ates on Facebook to make calls on potential customers, which is how the company measures its re-
turn on its Facebook marketing budget.19 ■
USE THE POWER OF PUBLICITY Publicity is any commercial news covered by the media that 
boosts sales but for which a small company does not pay. Publicity has power; because it is from 
an unbiased source, a news feature about a company or a product that appears in a newspaper or 
magazine has more impact on people’s buying decisions than an advertisement does. Exposure
in any medium raises a company’s visibility and boosts sales, and, best of all, publicity is free! It 
does require some creativity and effort, however.
The following tactics can help entrepreneurs stimulate publicity for their companies:
Write an article that will interest your customers or potential customers. One marketing 
and advertising consultant writes a twice-monthly column for the local newspaper on use-
ful topics such as “Unlocking the Mysteries of Big Data,” “Advertising Strategies for Small 
Retailers,” and “How CEOs Can Use Social Media.” Not only do the articles help build his 
credibility as an expert, but they also have attracted new customers to his business. Do not 
focus all your writing on traditional media outlets. Outlets such as blogs provide a wide 
reach to a very targeted market.
Sponsor an event designed to attract attention. Divurgent Healthcare Advisors, located 
in Dallas, Texas, sponsors local charitable events for children’s healthcare. For example, 
the company raises $5,000 a year for a children’s hospital at an annual trade show and its 
employees participate in other fundraisers for children’s healthcare systems.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
TABLE 8.2 Bootstrap Marketing Tactics
● 
Help organize and sponsor a service- or community-oriented project.
● 
Sponsor offbeat, memorable events. Build a giant banana split or rent a theater for a morning and invite kids for a free viewing.
● 
Always be on the lookout for new niches to enter. Try to develop multiple niches.
● 
Offer to speak about your business, industry, product, or service to local organizations.
● 
Launch a loyalty program that gives customers a reason to return. Be sure to provide loyalty program members with benefits, such 
as special offers, discounts, shopping previews, and others.
● 
Reward existing customers for referring new customers to your company. When customers refer business to Choice Translating, a 
language translation company in Charlotte, North Carolina, they receive a special gift.
● 
Sell at every opportunity. One brewery includes a minicatalog advertising T-shirts and mugs in every six-pack it sells. Orders for 
catalog items are climbing fast.
● 
Develop a sales “script” that asks customers a series of questions to hone in on what they are looking for and what will lead them 
to the conclusion that your product or service is it!
● 
Sell gift certificates. They really boost your cash flow.
● 
Create samples of your product and give them to customers. You’ll increase sales later.
● 
Offer a 100%, money-back, no-hassles guarantee. By removing the customer’s risk of buying, you increase your product’s 
attractiveness.
● 
Create a frequent-buyer program. Remember how valuable existing customers are. Work hard to keep the customers you have! 
One coffee shop kept its customers coming back with a punch-card promotion that gave a free pound of coffee after a customer 
purchased nine pounds.
● 
Clip articles that feature your business and send reprints to customers and potential customers. Keep reminding them of who you 
are and why you’re valuable to them.
● 
Test how well your ads “pull” with coded coupons that customers bring in. Focus your ad expenditures on those media that 
produce the best results for you.
● 
Create “tip sheets” to pass out to customers and potential customers (e.g., landscape tips on lawn maintenance).
● 
Find ways to make your product or service irresistible to your customers. One furniture company e-mails photos of big-ticket 
items customers are considering, and sales closing rates have climbed 25 percent.
● 
Create an award for your community (e.g., a landscape company presented a “best yard” award each season).
● 
Create a big event of your own: “January is Customer Appreciation Month. Buy one suit and get a second one at 50 percent off.”
● 
Conduct a contest in the community (e.g., a photographer sponsored a juried photo contest for different age groups). One 
restaurant that targeted the business crowd for lunch encouraged customers to leave their business cards (which gave the 
restaurateur the ability to e-mail them daily lunch specials) to enter a drawing for a free $50 iTunes gift card.
● 
Collect testimonials from satisfied customers and use them in ads, brochures, and so on. Testimonials are one of the most effective 
forms of advertising!
● 
Purchase customized postage stamps that feature your company’s logo (see PhotoStamps at http://photo.stamps.com) and use them
on business correspondence.
● 
Get a former journalist to help you write a story “pitch” for local media.
● 
Show an interest in your customers’ needs. If you spot a seminar that would be of interest to them, tell them! Become a valuable 
resource for them.
● 
Find unique ways to thank customers, especially first-time buyers, for their business (e.g., a note, a lunch, a gift basket, and so on).
● 
Give loyal customers a “freebie” occasionally. You might be surprised at how long they will remember it.
● 
Create a newsletter that features your customers or clients and their businesses (e.g., a photo of a client using your product in his or 
her business).
● 
Cooperate with other businesses selling complementary products and services in marketing efforts and campaigns, a process called 
fusion marketing. Share mailing lists and advertising time or space or work together on a special promotion.
● 
Use major competitors’ coupons against them. The owner of an independent sandwich shop routinely pulled business from a 
nearby national chain by advertising that he would accept its coupons.
● 
Market your company’s uniqueness. Many customers enjoy buying from small companies that are different and unique. The 
owners of the only tea plantation in the United States used that fact to their advantage in establishing a customer base.

Involve celebrities “on the cheap.” Few small businesses can afford to hire celebrities as
spokespersons for their companies. Some companies have discovered other ways to get 
celebrities to promote their products, however. For instance, when the founders of Lookout 
Mobile Security were launching their company, they went to the Academy Awards and set 
up hardware to extend their Bluetooth signal to more than a mile. Using this technology,
they identified all of the celebrities whose mobile devices were vulnerable to being hacked. 
The stunt got the new company considerable attention in the media. The company has since 
grown to more than 20 million customers.20
Contact local television and radio stations and offer to be interviewed. Many local 
news or talk shows are looking for guests to talk about topics of interest to their audiences 
(especially in January and February). Even local shows can reach new customers.
Publish a newsletter. With a personal computer and desktop publishing software, any 
entrepreneur can publish a professional-looking newsletter. Freelancers can offer design 
and editing advice. Use the newsletter to reach present and potential customers, providing 
them with timely and useful information.
Contact local business and civic organizations and offer to speak to them. A powerful, 
informative presentation can win new business. (Be sure your public speaking skills are up
to par first! If not, consider joining Toastmasters.)
Offer or sponsor a seminar. Teaching people about a subject you know a great deal about 
builds confidence and goodwill among potential customers. The owner of a landscaping 
service and nursery offers a short course in landscape architecture and always sees sales
climb afterward.
Write news releases and fax or e-mail them to the media. The key to having a news
release picked up and printed is finding a unique angle on your business or industry that 
would interest an editor. Keep it short, simple, and interesting. E-mail press releases should 
be shorter than printed ones—typically four or five paragraphs rather than one or two
pages—and they should include a link to the company’s Web site.
Volunteer to serve on community and industry boards and committees. You can make 
your town a better place to live and work and raise your company’s visibility at the 
same time.
Sponsor a community project or support a nonprofit organization or charity. Not only 
will you be giving something back to the community, but you will also gain recognition, 
goodwill, and, perhaps, customers for your business. The key 
is to partner with charities that match the company’s values and
mission, whether that involves rescuing homeless pets or provid-
ing back-to-school supplies for underprivileged kids. Sweetwater 
Brewery in Atlanta, Georgia, sponsors an annual bike ride that 
raises money for Camp Twin Lake, a camp providing life-
changing experiences to children facing serious illnesses, dis-
abilities, and other life challenges.21
Promote a cause. According to the Cone Communications Social 
Impact Study, 89 percent of customers (compared to only 
66 percent of customers in the study conducted twenty years 
earlier) say that, other things being equal, they are likely to 
switch from one brand to another if the other brand is associated 
with a good cause.22 By engaging in cause marketing, entrepre-
neurs can support a worthy cause that is important to them and 
generate publicity and goodwill for their companies at the same 
time. The key is choosing a cause that is important to your cus-
tomers. One marketing expert offers the following formula for 
selecting the right cause: mission statement + personal passion 
+ customer demographics = ideal cause.23

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Michael Houlihan and Bonnie Harvey: Barefoot
Cellars When Michael Houlihan and Bonnie Harvey first launched their San Francisco, 
California, winemaking company, Barefoot Cellars, they did not have the minimum of $100,000 to
commit to advertising that the bigger retail stores require to stock a new brand. To help gain 
awareness, Barefoot Cellars began to give away free wine to local nonprofits to support their
fundraising events. The strategy worked. People enjoyed the new wine and appreciated the com-
pany supporting their favorite causes. As the company grew into new markets, it continued to use 
the same strategy. As its primary market entry strategy, Barefoot Cellars hired staff to find
nonprofits to support in each new market. After becoming a national brand, the founders sold
Barefoot Cellars to E&J Gallo.24 ■
DON’T JUST SELL; ENTERTAIN Today, gaining word-of-mouth support 
via social media is essential to a company’s marketing success. However,
accomplishing this requires entrepreneurs to engage and even entertain 
their customers. Companies spend more than $4 billion each year for 
online video advertising. A video that stands out, is “liked,” and is shared
with others must be entertaining. For instance, Tom Dickson, CEO and 
founder of Blendtec, stars in a series of YouTube videos where he sticks 
a variety of objects into a Blendtec blender. Dickson has put an iPhone, a
glow stick, a crowbar, golf balls, an iPad, Bic lighters, and a can of Spam 
in a Blendtec Total Blender to answer the question, “Will it blend?”
Many of the videos receive millions of views. The ads have helped grow 
the company from a start-up to an industry leader employing more than
450 people.25
STRIVE TO BE UNIQUE One of the most effective bootstrap marketing 
tactics is to create an image of uniqueness for your business.As you learned
in Chapter 5, entrepreneurs can achieve a unique place in the market in a variety of ways, including
through the products and services they offer, the marketing and promotional campaigns they use, 
the store layouts they design, and the business strategies they employ. The goal is to stand out from
the crowd. Few things are as uninspiring to customers as a “me-too” business that offers nothing
unique. Table 8.3 offers suggestions on ways that a retail store can stand out from the competition.
BUILD A COMMUNITY WITH CUSTOMERS Some of the most successful companies interact with their 
customers regularly, intentionally, and purposefully to create meaningful, lasting relationships with 
them. Etsy, an e-commerce Web site that offers handmade or vintage items and art and craft supplies, 
has fueled growth by connecting its customers into communities referred to as “teams.” Etsy has teams 
that include artists with a common interest (one team of almost 400 is focused on painting miniatures), 
customers from a common city (the Little Rock, Arkansas, team has more than 400 members), or teams 
that cross interests and locations (fashion designers in Miami, Florida). The teams help each other 
promote their goods and expand their offerings sold through the Etsy Web site.26
Company Web sites and social media also are important tools for building a community with 
customers. Brendan’s Irish Pub used Facebook to build a list of 3,500 fans before the restaurant 
opened. Tyler Rex, owner of Brenan’s, uses Facebook to generate “buzz” for parties, sell merchan-
dise, and promote various events. Burt’s Bees uses Facebook to create new products interactively 
with its customers. Pacific Bioscience Laboratories, the maker of Clarisonic face brushes, shows 
customers how to use the product on its Facebook page and conducts a contest to encourage 
customers to send photos of themselves using a Clarisonic. Pacific Bioscience pledged to donate 
$1 to charity each new “like” on Facebook, which raised $30,000 to help women with cancer.27
CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL Closely linked to building a community 
with customers is the strategy of creating an emotional attachment with them. Companies that 
establish a deeper relationship with their customers than one based merely on making a sale have 
the capacity to be exceptional bootstrap marketers. These businesses win because customers 
receive an emotional boost every time they buy these companies’ products or services. They 
connect with their customers emotionally by providing captivating products, supporting causes 
that are important to their customer base, taking exceptional care of their customers, surpassing 
customers’ expectations in quality and service, or making doing business with them a fun and

TABLE 8.3 Seven Principles That Make Your Shop Pop
Pamela Danziger, president of the marketing consulting firm Unity Marketing, offers seven principles that can transform any store 
into a shop that “pops.”
1. Offer high levels of customer involvement and interaction. When customers have the opportunity to interact with a product, 
they spend more time in the store, which increases the probability that they will buy something. That’s the guiding principle 
behind Barnes & Noble’s decision to incorporate chairs and couches as well as coffee and snack bars into its bookstores.
2. Evoke shoppers’ curiosity to explore with a unique displays, store layout, and selection of merchandise. One jewelry store
captured the attention of passersby with a window display that featured not only unique pieces of jewelry but also a collection of 
interesting fossils, crystals, geodes, and unusual rock formations. The display increased the number of walk-in shoppers and sales.
3. Exude a contagious air of excitement, energy, and “electricity.” Apple Stores generate an astonishing volume of sales per 
square foot by creating an energized atmosphere. The decor is modern and minimalist so that products stand out. iPads located 
next to every product on display provide interactive product, service, and support information and allow shoppers to summon 
a salesperson in a flash. Shoppers who have questions or technical problems can ask a highly trained expert at the Genius Bar. 
Employees periodically offer free classes on using Apple products.
4. Create a synergistic convergence of atmosphere, store design, and merchandise that results in a special place for customers. 
The goal is to create a “paradox environment,” one that offers customers displays and products they expect but also surprises 
them with something that is unique and unusual, even bizarre. To promote a new loyalty card program called Sprize with the 
tagline “Turning shopping on its head,” a Gap store in London surprised shoppers by displaying 32 mannequins suspended from 
the ceiling upside down and arranged for three cars and a hot dog stand parked in front of the store to be flipped on their tops.
5. Provide an authentic values-driven experience. Godfrey’s Welcome to Dogdom, a pet boutique located in Mohnton, 
Pennsylvania, sees the world from a dog’s point of view and stocks a full line of dog-related products, ranging from essentials 
such as specialty foods, health-related products, and pet care items to luxuries such as hand-cast stone sculptures, cast bronze 
statues, dog apparel, and healthy fresh-baked dog biscuits in a multitude of flavors. Customers can book their pets for a doggie 
play group or schedule family time with their pets at one of the store’s play parks. Special events such as a Valentine’s Day
Whine and Dine Brunch, a Pooch Smooch Easter photography session, and a Howl-o-ween Pawrade and Pawty keep customers 
and their beloved pets coming back to Godfrey’s.
6. Provide a price-value model that customers understand and support. The Great Recession has made shoppers value conscious, 
but that does not mean discounting is the best way to attract customers. Businesses that show customers the value their products
provide create a good value proposition without having to resort to price cuts. “Our focus is on solutions to our customers’ 
problems and issues with their dogs and is not based on commodity price and product selling,” says Barb Emmett of Godfrey’s
Welcome to Dogdom.
7. Maintain a friendly, welcoming store that gives customers a reason to return. In some stores, salespeople act as if they are
doing customers a favor by waiting on them. Stores that pop take the opposite approach, welcoming customers and treating them 
as if they are important (because they are!). At an Arby’s franchise in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, 89-year-old Pearl Weaver greets 
customers with waving pom-poms, a big smile, and a happy “Welcome to Arby’s.” The store’s manager, Christian Stakes, says 
not a week goes by without “Miz Pearl,” as customers affectionately call her, being mentioned in online and in-store customer 
satisfaction surveys. “If she’s off for a week, people ask about her,” he says.
The goal is to create a store with “soul” that engages customers on many different levels; that creates a fun, festive atmosphere; and 
that has a mission that goes far beyond merely selling products.

enjoyable experience. Building and nurturing an ongoing relationship with customers establishes 
a relationship of trust, a vital component of every marketing effort. The Cone Communications 
Social Impact Study reports that 82 percent of Americans (84 percent of those in Millennial 
generation) consider a company’s business practices when making purchase decisions.28
The goal is not only to create lifelong, loyal customers but also to transform customers into 
passionate brand advocates, people who promote a company’s products or services to friends, fam-
ily members, and others. Although many companies manufacture tablet PCs, few have achieved 
the iconic status of Apple’s iPad, which allows customers to perform a variety of tasks, ranging 
from word processing and downloading e-books and music to accessing the Internet and making

face-to-face video calls. Its sleek, lightweight, touch-screen design resonates with customers be-
cause it reflects the way they want to use a tablet PC and evokes an image of “cool.” The result of 
this emotional connection with customers: sales of 25 million units in a little more than a year and 
a base of loyal fans who happily promote the company to their friends—at no cost to the company.
One important aspect of connecting with customers is defining the company’s unique selling 
proposition (USP), a key customer benefit of a product or service that sets it apart from its competi-
tion. To be effective, a USP must actually be unique—something the competition does not (or can-
not) provide—as well as compelling enough to encourage customers to buy. Unfortunately, many 
business owners never define their companies’ USP, and the result is an uninspiring me-too message
that cries out “buy from us” without offering customers any compelling reason to do so.
A successful USP answers the critical question that every customer asks: “What’s in it for 
me?” A USP should express in no more than 10 words what a business can do for its customers.
Can your product or service save your customers time or money, make their lives easier or more 
convenient, improve their self-esteem, or make them feel better? If so, you have the foundation
for building a USP. For instance, Toms donates a pair of shoes to an impoverished child for every 
pair of shoes it sells. Toms also sells eyewear and donates to a charity that helps restore sight 
to people in developing countries. Toms has a simple but clear USP: “One for one.” Saddleback 
Leather, a maker of high-end leather bags, has a USP that communicates the quality of its prod-
ucts: “They’ll Fight Over It When You’re Dead.” Naomi Dunford, founder of IttyBiz, a marketing 
consulting firm that helps small companies with no more than five employees create bootstrap 
marketing strategies, says her company’s USP is “Marketing for businesses without marketing 
departments.”29
The best way to identify a meaningful USP that connects a company to its target customers 
is to describe the primary benefit(s) its product or service offers customers and then to list other, 
secondary benefits it provides. A business is unlikely to have more than three primary benefits, 
which should be unique and able to set it apart. When describing the top benefits the company 
offers its customers, entrepreneurs must look beyond just the physical characteristics of the prod-
uct or service. Sometimes the most powerful USP emphasizes the intangible, psychological, 
and emotional benefits a product or service offers customers—for example, safety, “coolness,”
l
security, acceptance, and status. The goal is to use the USP to enable a company to stand out in
customers’ minds.
It is also important to develop a brief list of the facts that support your company’s USP, such 
as 24-hour service, a fully trained staff, awards won, and so on. By focusing the message on these
top benefits and the facts supporting them, business owners can communicate their USPs to their 
target audiences in meaningful, attention-getting ways. Building a firm’s marketing message
around its core USP spells out for customers the specific benefit they get if they buy that product 
or service and why they should do business with your company rather than with the competition. 
Finally, once a small company begins communicating its USP to customers, it has to fulfill the
promise! Nothing erodes a company’s credibility as quickly as promising customers a benefit and 
then failing to deliver on that promise.
Many small companies are finding common ground with their customers on an issue that 
is becoming increasingly important to many people: the environment. Small companies selling 
everything from jeans to toothpicks are emphasizing their “green” products and are making an 
emotional connection with their customers in the process. Companies must be truthful, however, 
or their marketing pitches can backfire and damage their reputations. Consumers are becoming 
more vigilant in their search for companies that are guilty of “greenwashing,” touting unsubstan-
tiated or misleading claims about the environmental friendliness of their products. Customers 
feel good about doing business with companies that manufacture products according to green 
principles, support environmental causes, donate a portion of their pretax earnings to philan-
thropic organizations, and operate with a clear sense of fulfilling their social responsibility.
CREATE AN IDENTITY FOR YOUR BUSINESS THROUGH BRANDING One of the most effective ways 
for entrepreneurs to differentiate their businesses from the competition is to create a unique 
identity for it through branding. Although they may not have the resources to build a brand 
name as well known as Google (Google’s brand is estimated to be worth more than $159 billion), 
entrepreneurs can be successful in building a brand identity for their companies on a smaller 
unique selling 
proposition (USP)
a key customer benefit of a 
product or service that sets 
it apart from the competi-
tion; it answers the critical 
question every customer

pany’s unique selling propo-

scale in the markets they serve. A large budget is not a prerequisite for building a strong brand, 
but creating one does take a concerted, well-coordinated effort that connects every touch point 
a company has with its customers with the company’s desired image. A strong brand evokes the
company’s story in customers’ minds.30
Branding involves communicating a company’s unique selling proposition to its target cus-
tomers in a consistent and integrated manner. A brand is a company’s “face” in the marketplace, 
and it is built on a company’s promise of providing quality goods or services to satisfy multiple 
customer needs. A brand sends an important message to customers; it signals that the benefits 
a company offers (which may be intangible) are worth more than those its competitors can offer. 
Companies that build brands successfully benefit from increased customer loyalty, the ability to 
command higher prices, greater visibility, and increased name recognition. Small companies that 
attempt to lure customers with discounts or constant sales often dilute their brands and cheapen 
them in the customers’ eyes. Figure 8.2 shows the connection between a company’s brand and its
unique selling proposition.
EMBRACE SOCIAL MARKETING Although social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter 
are better known for their personal applications, they also have significant potential as marketing
tools. Seventy-three percent of Internet users participate in at least one social networking site, 
more than double the 34 percent in 2008.31 Businesses recognize that many of their current and 
potential customers use social networking sites and are reaching out to them with social marketing 
efforts. A recent survey of 600 small business owners found that 90 percent of them use social 
media to connect with existing and potential customers.32 Figure 8.3 shows the most common
social media tools used by small business owners. Most experts suggest that entrepreneurs find
the best social media for their particular business instead of trying to use all of them at once. Keep 
in mind that it may take several months for social media marketing to make an impact on a small 
business; persistence and consistency are key.
Social networking sites are an ideal type of bootstrap marketing tool because they allow 
entrepreneurs to market their companies effectively and at little or no cost. One recent survey re-
ports that 89 percent of marketers say their social media marketing efforts have generated greater 
exposure for their companies and many other benefits (see Figure 8.4).33 Small companies use
a variety of social networking tools to market their companies, but three of the most popular are 
LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter:
LinkedIn. LinkedIn has overtaken Facebook as the most widely used social media site by 
entrepreneurs. To use LinkedIn as a marketing tool, entrepreneurs should create a personal

Victory Auto Service and Glass, founded in 1997 by Jeff Matt, 
built its base of loyal customers with strong personal relationships. 
Personal customer service is at the heart of Victory Auto’s business 
model. The company has five locations and a mobile auto glass 
service in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, metro area.
As the business grew from its first location, Matt found that 
maintaining the personal relationships with his customers, which
was the core of his company’s success, became more difficult to 
maintain. Matt decided to turn to social media to complement
face-to-face connections with Victory Auto’s customers and
sought the help of Stephanie Gutierrez, a communications spe-
cialist and loyal customer, to help create a social media strategy
for Victory Auto.
Gutierrez experimented with various social media tactics until
she found a strategy that supported the personal connection with
customers that Matt relied on to build his company. Facebook is the
heart of Victory Auto’s social media strategy. When Gutierrez devel-
oped the company’s Facebook page, she took the time to think like 
the business’s average customer: car owners who were not neces-
sarily interested in cars. The typical customer interacts with Victory
Auto because they have to, not because they want to. Instead of 
creating a page with information on cars, she adds posts related to 
traffic, commuting, and travel that everyone who owns a car would
be interested in reading. At first, she posted longer articles with links 
to articles about cars. However, these posts did not seem to register
with the typical customer. Now Gutierrez posts much shorter text
entries that are written in a personal style with many photos.
The second major aspect of Victory Auto’s social media strat-
egy involves YouTube videos. Gutierrez developed several short 
videos that are geared toward people who do not know much 
about cars. The videos on Victory Auto’s YouTube channel include 
short how-to videos and tours of its various store locations around 
Minneapolis. For example, the most popular video is one that 
shows how to top off windshield wiper fluid!
Matt believes that success in the auto service business is 
based on trust, and that trust is built by getting to know the peo-
ple who work at Victory Auto. Many of the social media posts 
are about employees of Victory Auto, focusing on their birthdays, 
other celebrations, and day-to-day casual interactions while at
work. About 20 percent of Victory Auto employees are active on 
Facebook. When they become Facebook and sometimes even per-
sonal friends with customers, they are encouraged to share pho-
tos on Facebook. These photos can then be tagged to help build 
more traffic at the Victory Auto Facebook page.
Victory Auto Glass uses social media to promote the various 
charities, including Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and Toys for 
Tots. A local charity that Victory Auto is heavily involved with is 
Free2Be, which provides auto care and donated cars for economi-
cally disadvantaged people in Anoka County, Minnesota. Volun-
teers with Free2Be can use the repair bays at Victory Auto free 
of charge to repair donated cars. Victory Auto also gives free or 
discounted car repairs for people helped by the Free2Be program. 
Gutierrez then posts some of these stories on the company’s Face-
book page to help promote the charity.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Facebook. People spend nearly 12 billion hours per month on Facebook, the world’s 
largest social network. Creating a Facebook business page is not the same as creating a 
personal profile page, however. On Facebook, an entrepreneur should create a Welcome 
page that is designed to create interest in the company’s products or services and that 
encourages visitors to “like” the business. Businesses can generate likes by posting the 
Facebook URL on in-store signs, business cards, shopping bags, and anything else cus-
tomers are likely to see. E-mail and “refer-a-friend” campaigns and links to Facebook 
from a company’s Web site and blog also increase the number of likes the company 
receives. One key to using Facebook successfully as a marketing tool is to keep a com-
pany’s page fresh, just like the merchandise displays in a physical store. Adding photo-
graphs, announcements of upcoming events, polls and surveys, and games and contests 
or promoting a cause the company supports are excellent ways to create buzz and keep 
fans coming back. Entrepreneurs must invest time in their social media marketing 
effort; nearly 58 percent of marketers spend at least six hours a week on social media 
marketing.34
Twitter. Twitter users send more than 1 billion tweets per week, and 42 percent of us-
ers look to Twitter for information about the products and services they buy.35 Twitter, a 
microblogging (no more than 140 characters) service, is ideal for interacting with custom-
ers or potential customers, promoting daily specials and upcoming events, and driving 
traffic to a company’s Web site or blog. Small business expert Steve Strauss recommends 
Twitter as a good way for entrepreneurs to establish their expertise. Strauss also says that 
80 percent of content sent out should be about customers, while only 20 percent should 
promote the entrepreneur’s business.36 Weetabix, a whole-grain cereal company, used
Twitter to promote a new line of On the Go Breakfast Biscuits. The company posted 
short videos of people going through normal morning routines. Consumers would then 
decide what happened next in the video by posting hashtags such as #getup, #hitsnooze, 
#grabbreakfast, and #leavethehouse. The videos reached more than 262,000 people on 
Twitter, leading to a five-fold growth in the company’s followers. As part of its sponsorship
of the French Open Tennis Tournament, BNP Paribas Bank offered a social media game 
that allowed Twitter users to play a game of tennis against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, a French 
professional player. Participants dragged-and-dropped a tennis ball on a virtual screen that 
controlled a robot hitting balls at Tsonga live on a tennis court.37 Twitter also is a useful 
tool for monitoring a company’s customer service performance, something that companies 
are discovering is essential to preserving the quality of their brands. A recent poll from 
RightNow and Harris Interactive reports that 85 percent of customers who posted a nega-
tive shopping experience with a company and were subsequently contacted by that com-
pany ultimately took an action online that benefited the business (such as changing their 
negative review to a positive one).38 The following tips help entrepreneurs use Twitter suc-
cessfully as a bootstrap marketing tool:
● Connect with others as a person, not as a brand. Twitter users want to talk with people, 
not companies.
● Engage in conversations. Twitter is a two-way communication tool, not an outlet for 
sending one-way messages, such as press releases and marketing copy.
● Give people a reason to follow you. Reveal the “inside story” of your company, ask cus-
tomers for feedback, or offer special deals to followers.
● Link Twitter to your company’s Web site. Refer followers to your company’s Web site, 
blog, or a video about your company and its products or services.39
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Curtis Kimball: The Crème Brûlée Man Curtis Kimball 
grew his highly successful food cart, The Crème Brûlée Man, with no marketing budget. 
Kimball uses Twitter to promote his food cart as it travels among various neighborhoods in
San Francisco. Kimball has more than 12,000 followers on Twitter, who rely on his posts to let them 
know where his cart will be and what flavors he is offering each day. He also uses Twitter to get 
customer feedback on what flavors he should offer and on new locations he should try. To engage
his followers, Kimball uses humor in his posts.40 ■

CHAPTER 8 • BUILDING A POWERFUL BOOTSTRAP MARKETING PLAN
323
Social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and
others, can be a vital and productive component of a company’s 
bootstrap marketing strategy. Because the typical customer sees
more than 20,000 advertising and sales messages each week, 
small businesses’ marketing efforts, particularly their social media
marketing efforts, must be well planned, consistent, and focused.
Otherwise, they will become lost in a sea of ads, posts, tweets, 
and blogs.
The first key to a successful social media marketing strategy 
is understanding your customers and knowing where they are in 
the social media universe and what they expect from you. Entre-
preneurs can use the following tips and success stories to develop 
a social media marketing strategy that works for their businesses:
Use social media to level the playing field. One of the 
greatest advantages of using social media is its low cost,
which means that large companies have no more of a mar-
keting advantage than small businesses. “We’ve never been 
able to compete with larger casual dining restaurants that 
own the airwaves,” says Jen Gulvik, vice president of market-
ing for Houlihan’s Restaurants, a small restaurant chain based 
in Leawood, Kansas. “We can’t outshout them with our 
marketing budget, but it’s still essentially free to play in social 
media. We can be in this space and do as well, if not better,
than our larger competitors.”
Build your brand—and your customer base—with social 
media. Einstein Bros. Bagels, a bagel, sandwich, and cof-
fee chain with nearly 450 locations across the United States, 
had amassed 4,700 Facebook fans before launching a social 
media–based bagel giveaway during the fall. Customers 
responded and within one week, the number of fans had in-
creased to 300,000. When Einstein Bros. repeated the promo-
tion on Facebook the following spring, its fan base jumped 
to more than 600,000! “We’re not a national advertiser,” 
says James O’Reilly, the company’s chief concept officer. “We 
decided to make social media a pillar of our marketing ef-
forts. It’s a whole new channel for businesses to engage their 
customers in a two-way dialogue.” Today, Einstein Bros. boasts
nearly 700,000 Facebook fans who ask about new products 
and upcoming promotions, post photos of themselves (and 
their pets) enjoying an Einstein Bros. bagel, and respond to
questions the company posts on its Wall (“Which bagel and
shmear combination do you crave most—sweet or savory?”).
Remember that no matter what media you use to pro-
mote your business, no one really cares what you do; 
potential customers care only about what you can do 
for them. One of the greatest advantages for small busi-
nesses that use social media is its ability to naturally showcase 
their uniqueness, their informal culture, and their staff’s pas-
sion for what they do. Once prospects understand the value 
that a company’s products or services hold for them, selling to 
them becomes much easier. Use social media to showcase the 
results your company can create for customers.
Be creative in your social media promotions. Using a 
creative Facebook campaign, California Tortilla, a 26-unit 
restaurant chain in Rockville, Maryland, increased the number 
of Facebook fans by 50 percent and generated a 10 percent
increase in same-store sales—and spent less than $700. The 
company offered a free order of chips and queso to its Face-
book fans but promised to upgrade the offer to a free taco 
if its fan base reached 13,000 people. The viral nature of 
social media took over, and California Tortilla ended up with 
more than 16,000 likes. “The people who got involved were
super-passionate fans,” says marketing director Stacey Kane. 
“Based on customer engagement, it was a win.”
Listen before you talk. Success with social media marketing 
requires a different approach than traditional advertising, 
which relies primarily on one-way communication, telling your
audience about your business and its products and services. 
Social media marketing requires that businesses listen before
they engage their audience in a two-way conversation. Mari 
Luangrath, owner of Foiled Cupcakes, an upscale cupcake 
bakery in Chicago, has no physical storefront for her busi-
ness yet manages to sell 1,000 dozen cupcakes each month 
at an average price of $38 per dozen. Luangrath says she 
developed 94 percent of her customers using social media 
marketing tools, especially Twitter. Her strategy is to identify 
online conversations about food, baking, and cupcakes that 
she and her employees can join naturally and build trust by 
providing useful content and comments. “I’m very comfort-
able with traditional marketing,” says Luangrath, “but I don’t 
want to market to everybody. I want to find people who want 
to hear what I have to say and then, at the end of the en-
gagement, purchase my product.” Luangrath also has joined 
groups of Chicago administrative professionals—the people
who plan office parties and events—on LinkedIn and posts 
useful articles for them. “You want to engage people, get 
feedback, and start a conversation. Then you can say, ‘Why 
don’t we drop some cupcakes by and show you what we 
can do?’”
Use social media to reward loyal customers, fans, 
followers, and promoters of your brand. Jordan 
Zweigoron, founder and “chief psycho” of Psycho Donuts, 
a doughnut shop in Campbell, California, that sells uniquely 
flavored doughnuts served by employees wearing nurse uni-
forms, uses Fanminder, a mobile marketing service that allows 
businesses to send text messages containing special offers
and promotions to customers who opt in. The company also 
uses Twitter to reward its loyal customers, but Zweigoron says 
Psycho Donuts’s Fanminder offers generate a response that is 
three to four times greater than its Twitter promotions.

Make Social Media Work for Your Business

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Use online video to show off your products and 
services. Television advertisers have known for decades that
video is the ideal way to show people how a product or ser-
vice works. Social media sites such as YouTube give even the 
smallest businesses the opportunity to show their products 
and services in action at minimal cost. BBQ Guys, a store in 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that sells everything related to bar-
becuing, began posting videos featuring its grills on YouTube 
in 2006. The videos were so successful that the company re-
cruited a local chef to host them. BBQ Guys has posted more 
than 400 videos on YouTube that have more than 1.4 million 
views. A visitor who watches a video is twice as likely to make 
a purchase as one who does not. “We see the videos almost 
like a TV commercial,” says Troy Olson, the company’s digital
advertising manager. “We’re planting our brand name.”
Give customers a reason to tune in to your business. 
Create a destination by posting fresh content and promoting
upcoming specials, sales, and events. Resist the tendency to let
the hectic nature of your schedule drive out the time necessary 
to make social marketing work for your business. To make so-
cial media marketing pay off, entrepreneurs must make social 
media marketing a regular part of their work schedules.
Use social media to encourage your customers to 
talk—and then listen. Social media are ideal for engaging 
customers in two-way conversations. Beachbody, a producer
of fitness videos based in Santa Monica, California, realized 
that many of the online conversations in which its employees
participated originated from faith-based sites. It was a market
niche that the company had never considered until its employ-
ees began listening to potential customers’ conversations. The
company introduced Body Gospel, a series of workouts set to 
contemporary Christian music that have been successful.
Use analytics to measure your company’s social media 
results. Entrepreneurs should measure the results of their 
social media marketing efforts so that they know which ones 
work best. Social media marketing efforts are always evolv-
ing, and entrepreneurs need useful feedback on their results. 
Many tools are available to measure success, but many of 
the standards that fit traditional advertising media, such as 
sales leads, sales, Web site traffic, customer engagement and 
retention, and profits, apply to social media.

Hands On . . . How To (continued)
Start a Blog A Web log (“blog”) is a frequently updated online journal that contains a writer’s
ideas on a multitude of topics and links to related sites. A recent survey by HubSport41 reports that:
● 62 percent of companies now use blogs as part of their marketing strategies.
● 82 percent of companies that publish blogs on a daily basis say they have acquired a 
customer through their blogs.
● 57 percent of companies that publish blogs monthly say they have acquired a customer 
through their blogs.
● 55 percent of marketers spent more time than money on blogging, reinforcing blogs as a 
strong tool for bootstrap marketing.
Business blogging can be an effective part of a bootstrap marketing strategy, enabling small busi-
nesses to communicate with large numbers of potential customers economically.
Blogs that attract the attention of existing and potential customers boost a company’s vis-
ibility and sales. Companies post their blogs, promote them on their Web sites and in other 
social media, and then watch as the viral nature of the Internet takes over with visitors posting 
comments and telling their friends about the blog. Many small companies allow customers to
contribute to their blogs, offering the potential for one of the most valuable marketing tools: 
unsolicited endorsements from satisfied users. Blogging’s informal dialogue is an ideal match 
for small companies whose culture and style also are casual. Linked to a company’s other social 
media marketing efforts (such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter), a blog can serve as its social 
media hub. Blogs can keep customers updated on new products, enhance customer service, and

CHAPTER 8 • BUILDING A POWERFUL BOOTSTRAP MARKETING PLAN
325
promote the company. If monitored regularly, blogs also can give entrepreneurs keen insight into 
their customers’ viewpoints and preferences. Creating a blog is not risk free, however. Compa-
nies must be prepared to deal with negative feedback from some visitors. Common platforms for 
creating blogs include WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Weebly, SquareSpace, and TypePad.
The following tips can help entrepreneurs implement a successful blogging strategy:
● Strive to cultivate the image of an expert or a trusted friend on a topic that is important 
to your customers. In his blog, the owner of a company that installs water gardens posts 
tips for maintaining a healthy water garden and answers questions his readers post.
● Be patient. A blog takes months to build up traffic and interest. To be successful, an en-
trepreneur must be willing to commit to writing regularly for a long time before the blog 
generates new business.
● Be honest, balanced, and interesting when writing a blog. High-pressure sales pitches do 
not work in the blogging world. Telling an interesting “inside story” about the company, 
its products or services, or some aspect of the business attracts readers. However, experts 
recommend the 80–20 rule for posting topics. Keep 80 percent of the posts about more 
general topics related to your industry or about your customers and only 20 percent of the 
posts about your company.
● Post blog entries consistently so that readers have a reason to return. Entrepreneurs 
should make blog posts at least once a week. Successful bloggers schedule time each day 
or several times a week to work on their blog posts.
● Ask customers for feedback. Blogs are powerful tools for collecting real-time market 
research inexpensively. It is easy to insert instant polls that allow readers to offer quick 
feedback.
● Use services such as Google Alerts that scan the Web for a company’s name and send 
e-mail alerts when it finds posts about a company. Entrepreneurs must monitor the online 
“buzz” about their companies; if they discover negative comments, they can address the 
issues in their blogs.
● Be cautious. If you are blogging to promote your business, be careful what you write 
about. Avoid making negative comments about competitors, addressing controversial 
topics, or making unsubstantiated claims.
● Promote the blog via social media and e-mail. It is easy to push out blog posts via Twit-
ter, Facebook LinkedIn, and e-mail marketing software. Include a link to your blog in your 
e-mail signature.42
Create Online Videos Video hosting sites such as YouTube give creative entrepreneurs the 
opportunity to promote their businesses at no cost by creating videos that feature their company’s
products and services in action. Unlike television ads, uploading a video to YouTube costs nothing,
and in some cases, the videos reach millions of potential customers. Watching online videos
is pervasive; YouTube reports that visitors view 3 billion videos per day.43 Of those marketers 
using social media, 56 percent actively use YouTube to post videos about their company and its
products.44 Successful online video campaigns don’t just educate and inform, they also entertain 
and engage customers. Although YouTube is still the most commonly used platform for videos, 
Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram offer alternative outlets for video content.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Dr. Irena Vaksman Dr. Irena Vaksman, a San Francisco 
dentist, uses a variety of social media tools to promote her practice. In addition to Twitter
and Facebook, Vaksman has a YouTube channel. On her channel, she shares several educational
videos about dental procedures. Vaksman says her efforts have helped her practice stand out in a 
crowed market.45 ■
Host a Special Event Another effective bootstrap marketing strategy is to host a special event that 
reinforces the company’s brand in customers’ minds. Mashable, an online social-media news site, 
hosts events to connect with its users. The company sees a benefit in connecting with its users in 

326
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
person, rather than only through its online platform. For instance, Mashable hosted an award show 
in Las Vegas to celebrate the best of social media. The event, which sold out all its tickets, blended
online voting with a live event to feature the awardees. Mashable also hosts live meet-ups across 
the country to connect with users and to learn what is happening in different communities.46
BE DEDICATED TO SERVICE AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION Many businesses have lost sight of 
the most important component of every business: the customer. Entrepreneurs must realize that 
everything in the business—even the business itself—depends on creating a satisfied customer. 
The rewards for providing excellent customer service are great, and the penalties for failing to do 
so are severe. Excellent customer service, as you learned in Chapter 4 is an key component of a 
company’s business model, does not look the same for every business. Excellence in customer 
service means that a company must meet the expectations its business model creates for customers. 
Excellent customer service may mean quick, efficient service, or it may mean absolute attention to 
customers’ specific wants and needs. A recent survey by Harris Interactive reports that 55 percent 
of consumers have become customers of a company just because of the company’s reputation for 
providing outstanding customer service. The study also revealed that 85 percent of customers are 
willing to pay extra (as much as 25 percent more) for products that are accompanied by excellent 
customer service.47 Conversely, another Harris Poll reports that 80 percent of customers say they 
will never return to a business after a negative customer service experience.48
Lost sales are only the beginning of a company’s woes, however. Unhappy customers are likely 
to tell their poor service stories to family members and friends. The Harris Interactive survey also 
shows that 79 percent of customers who have negative customer service experiences tell others 
about them.49 This negative word of mouth has a detrimental effect on the offending company. A 
study by the Jay H. Baker Retailing Initiative at the University of Pennsylvania reports that 48 per-
cent of shoppers say they will not patronize stores where they know that other customers have had 
bad service experiences.50 Most of these customers never complain; in fact, for every complaint a 
company receives, 17 other complaints go unspoken.51 These disgruntled customers exact revenge 
over their poor treatment, however. These days, a company that provides poor service may find itself 
being panned on Yelp, Twitter, Facebook, a YouTube video, a blog, or a Web site. A survey by Social 
Media Marketing University found that 74 percent of companies receive customer complaints via 
social media. However, 61 percent take up to a week to respond, and 21 percent of these companies 
never respond to these complaints. Consumers expect a quick response to their complaints on social
media. Companies that do not meet customer expectations for addressing their complaints face the
potential of even more negative comments from frustrated customers. The following tips can help
you to more effectively address online comments, suggestions, and complaints:52
● Consistently track all social media. Conduct frequent searches on Twitter, Facebook, In-
stagram, and on the Web to catch comments in blogs.
● Respond and take responsibility. If someone has a bad experience and tells the world 
through social media, post an apology and promise corrective action. Then send that person 
a private message to attempt to resolve the issue.
● The customer is always right. If there is a problem, fix it and let the person who com-
plained know what you have done. Even if there is nothing to change, offer the customer 
his or her money back or a discount in the future.
● Never be defensive. Think about the situation from the customer’s perspective and empa-
thize with his or her frustrations. Don’t argue. Let the customer know you feel his or her 
frustration.
● Keep a database of all complaints and suggestions. Rather than read and delete them, 
keep all complaints and suggestions and organize them into a database, which can help
show trends and consistent issues. Organize the database by specific issue addressed in the 
complaint, date, employee responsible for that part of the business, and other relevant facts.
Smart companies are rediscovering that unexpected, innovative, customized service can be a 
powerful marketing weapon. Perhaps the most effective marketing tool is a satisfied customer who 

CHAPTER 8 • BUILDING A POWERFUL BOOTSTRAP MARKETING PLAN
327
becomes a passionate brand evangelist for a company. Providing incomparable service—not neces-
sarily low prices—is one of the most effective ways to attract and maintain a growing customer base. 
Successful businesses recognize that superior customer service is only an intermediate step toward
the goal of customer satisfaction. The best companies seek to go beyond customer satisfaction, striv-
ing for customer astonishment! One way to achieve customer astonishment is to “underpromise and
overdeliver.” Smart entrepreneurs create reasonable expectations among their customers and then 
exceed them, knowing that those customers will generate positive “buzz” for the companies, which
is more valuable and more effective than the most expensive advertising campaign.
Certainly the least expensive—and the most effective—way to achieve customer satisfac-
tion is through friendly, personal service. Numerous surveys of customers in a wide diversity of 
industries—from manufacturing and services to banking and high tech—conclude that the most 
important element of service is “the personal touch.” Calling customers by name; making atten-
tive, friendly contact; and truly caring about their needs and wants is much more essential than 
any other factor—even convenience, quality, and speed! In our society, business transactions 
have become so automated that the typical customer is starved for personal attention. Genuine 
customer service requires that a business bridge that service gap, treat each customer as an indi-
vidual, and transform “high-tech” applications into a “high-touch” attitude.
How can a company achieve stellar customer service and satisfaction?
Listen to customers. The best companies constantly listen to their customers and respond 
to what they hear! This allows them to keep up with customers’ changing needs and ex-
pectations. The best way to find out what customers really want and value is to ask them. 
Businesses rely on a number of techniques, including surveys, focus groups, telephone
interviews, comment cards, suggestion boxes, toll-free hotlines, and regular one-on-one 
conversations (perhaps the best technique). The Internet is another useful tool for getting 
feedback from customers; many companies solicit complaints, suggestions, and ideas 
through their Web sites.
Keeping customer feedback in its proper perspective is important, however. Although 
listening to customers produces valuable feedback for business owners in many areas, 
it is not a substitute for an innovative company culture, solid market research, and a
t
well-devised marketing plan. Companies that rely solely on their customers to guide their 
marketing efforts often find themselves lagging the competition. Customers rarely have 
the foresight to anticipate market trends and do not always have a clear view of how new 
products or services could satisfy their needs.
Define superior service. Based on what customers say, managers and employees must 
decide exactly what “superior service” means in the company. Such a statement should
(1) be a strong statement of intent, (2) differentiate the company from others, and (3) have
value to customers. This is a critical component of any successful business model. Deluxe
Corporation, a printer of personal checks, defines superior service quite simply; the com-
pany promises 48 hour turnaround with zero defects.53
Set standards and measure performance. To be able to deliver on its promise of superior 
service, a business must establish specific standards and measure overall performance
against them. Satisfied customers should exhibit at least one of three behaviors: loyalty 
(increased customer retention rate), increased purchases (rising sales and sales per cus-
tomer), and resistance to rivals’ attempts to lure them away with lower prices (market share 
and price tolerance).54 Companies must track their performance on these and other service 
standards and reward employees accordingly.
Examine your company’s service cycle. What steps must a customer go through to pur-
chase your product or service? Business owners often are surprised at the complexity that 
has seeped into their customer service systems as they have evolved over time. One of the 
most effective techniques is to work with employees to flowchart each component in the 
company’s service cycle, including everything a customer has to do to buy your product or 
service. The goal is to look for steps, policies, and procedures that are unnecessary, redun-
dant, or unreasonable and then to eliminate them.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
See customer complaints as a mechanism for improving customer service. Smart entre-
preneurs see customer complaints as an important tool for improving their businesses and 
as a bridge to long-term customer relationships. Ignoring customers leads to disastrous out-
comes. Netflix, the movie rental company, made the decision to split its DVD rental busi-
ness from its online streaming video business. Netflix made this business decision despite 
negative reactions from customer focus groups. Customers liked the flexibility of being 
able to get video content from either format. The other negative impact for customers was 
a 40 percent average increase in monthly cost of using Netflix services. The result was the 
loss of 800,000 subscribers during the first three months after the split.55
When you create a negative customer experience, apologize and fix it—fast. No cus-
tomer service system is perfect, and companies can recover from creating a negative 
customer experience. A recent survey shows that 92 percent of customers say they would
return to a company after a negative customer experience if the company offered an apol-
ogy, a discount, or proof that its customer service would be better.56
Hire the right employees. A company’s customer service process is important, but the key 
ingredient in the superior service equation is the people who make it work. There is no 
substitute for friendly, courteous sales and service representatives, and hiring them requires 
a sound selection process. Business owners must always be on the lookout for employees
who emanate a customer service attitude and are empathetic, flexible, articulate, creative,
and able to think for themselves. Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, a company with a busi-
ness model based on customer service, hires people for their attitudes toward other people. 
The company’s philosophy on hiring is that skills and processes can be taught, but attitude
is ingrained in people’s character.57
Train employees to deliver superior service. Successful businesses train every employee 
who deals directly with customers; they don’t leave customer service to chance. Superior 
service companies devote 1 to 5 percent of their employees’ work hours to training, con-
centrating on how to meet, greet, and serve customers. Apple spends as much time training 
its technicians who work in its retail stores on communication skills as it does on processes 
and technical knowledge.58
Empower employees to offer superior service. One of the most important variables that 
determines whether employees deliver superior service is the degree to which they perceive 
they have permission to do so. The goal is to push decision making down the organization
to the employees who have contact with customers. This includes giving them the latitude 
to circumvent “company policy” if it means improving customer satisfaction. If frontline 
workers don’t have the power to solve disgruntled customers’ problems, they fear being 
punished for overstepping their boundaries and become frustrated, and the superior service 
cycle breaks down. Zytec, a manufacturing company in southern Minnesota, authorizes all 
employees to spend up to $1,000 without any approval to improve their work processes or 
satisfy a customer. The CEO of Zytec says employees are prudent with these funds and use

them responsibly.59 To be empowered, employees need knowledge and information,
adequate resources, and managerial support. 
Treat employees with respect and demonstrate to them how valuable they are. Creat-
ing a positive work environment, good work-life balance through policies such as flextime 
and vacation, and meaningful work leads to satisfied workers. Satisfied employees tend 
to create satisfied customers. In fact, a recent Gallup survey finds that although work 
environment is important, creating engaging work is the strongest predictor of satisfaction
among employees.60
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Caitlin McCabe, Real Bullets
Branding Caitlin McCabe, founder of Real Bullets Branding, a 
market research and strategy agency in Boston, asks her employees 
how they want to be rewarded when they have done exceptional 
work. She says this is an advantage a small business has over a large 
corporation that has to follow consistent policies. Her employees have
asked for things such as funding to attend a conference, a more flexible
schedule, and the latest iPhone. McCage says her employees appreciate 
their personalized rewards. McCabe’s personal approach shows she has 
taken the time to get to know what each one of them really wants for 
a job well done.61 ■
Use technology to provide improved service. The role of technology 
is not to create a rigid bureaucracy but to free employees from routine
clerical tasks, giving them more time and better tools to serve custom-
ers more effectively. Ideally, technology gives workers the information
they need to help customers and the time to serve them.
Reward superior service. What gets rewarded gets done. Companies
that want employees to provide stellar service must offer rewards for 
doing so. However, pay is not always the most powerful reward for recognizing employees 
who provide outstanding service. Zendesk uses weeble wobble toys as a reward for truly 
outstanding customer service. Although the toys have little monetary value, employees are
proud of the recognition they get for being able to display weeble wobbles on their desks 
because everyone in the company knows what they mean.62
Get top managers’ support. The drive toward superior customer service will fall far short 
of its target unless top managers support it fully. Success requires more than just a verbal 
commitment: It calls for managers’ involvement and dedication to making service a core 
company value. Achieving customer satisfaction must become ingrained in the strategic 
planning process and work its way into every nook and cranny of the organization. Once it 
does, employees will be able to provide stellar customer service with or without a checklist 
of “dos and don’ts.”
Give customers an unexpected surprise. In Louisiana, locals call it a lagniappe 
(“lan-yap”), a small gift that a merchant gives to a customer. The surprise does not have
to be expensive to be effective. For instance, when a customer makes a sizable purchase 
at Wilson Creek Outfitters, a fly-fishing shop in Morganton, North Carolina, the owner 
includes a dozen flies in the order for free. The cost of the lagniappe is minimal, but the 
goodwill and loyalty it garners is significant.
View customer service as an investment, not an expense. The companies that lead the 
way when it comes to retaining their customers view the money they spend on customer 
service as an investment rather than an expense. One of the most effective ways for en-
trepreneurs to learn this lesson is to calculate the cost of poor customer service to their 
companies. Once they calculate it, the cost of lost customers due to poor service is so as-
tonishing to most business owners that they quickly become customer service zealots. For 
instance, the owner of a small restaurant calculated that if every day he lost to poor service 
just one customer who spent just $5 per week, his business was losing $94,900 in revenue 
per year! The restaurateur immediately changed his approach to customer service.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS Loyal, long-term customers are the bedrock of every business.
High customer retention rates translate into superior financial performance. Earning customers’ 
loyalty requires businesses to take customer focus and service to unprecedented levels, and that 
means building long-term relationships with customers. Research shows that customers who are
satisfied with a company’s products and customer service are more likely to be repeat customers
and are less sensitive to price increases.63
Many studies also show that high levels of customer retention result in above-average profits 
and superior growth in market share.64 Powell’s Books, a Portland, Oregon, landmark known as 
the “City of Books” for its 68,000-square-foot store and huge inventory, has built a solid base of 
loyal customers in its 40-plus-year history, enabling the company to compete successfully against 
industry giants Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Powell’s Books has hosted several weddings for 
customers who met there, and one customer’s ashes are interred (at his request) in one of the
columns that is made to look like a stack of books at the northwest entrance to the store. Now 
that’s customer loyalty!65
Because about 20 percent of a typical company’s customers account for about 80 percent 
of its sales, focusing resources on keeping the best (and most profitable) customers is a bet-
ter investment than chasing “fair-weather” customers who will defect to any better deal that 
comes along. Suppose a company increases its customer base by 20 percent each year but 
retains only 85 percent of its existing customers. Its effective growth rate is just 5 percent per 
year [20% − (100% − 85%) = 5%]. If this same company can raise its customer retention 
rate to 95 percent, its net growth rate triples to 15 percent [20% − (100% − 5%) = 15%].66
Although winning new customers keeps a company growing, keeping existing ones is es-
sential to success. Dunnhumby, a global customer loyalty consulting firm, reports that a company 
must land 12 to 20 new customers to offset the impact of one lost loyal customer.67 Research 
shows that repeat customers spend 67 percent more than new customers. In addition, attracting a 
new customer actually costs the typical business seven to nine times as much as keeping an exist-
ing one.68 Therefore, small business owners would be better off asking “How can we improve 
customer value and service to encourage our existing customers to do more business with us?”
than “How can we increase our market share by 10 percent?” One way that companies can entice 
current customers to keep coming back is with a loyalty program, which many compa-
nies’ are linking to their social media presence.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Vanessa Merit Nornberg and Metal Mafia
Metal Mafia, a wholesaler of body and costume jewelry, surprises customers 
when they call to report a problem with defective or damaged goods. Metal Mafia 
tells customers to throw away the defective item, rather than waste their valuable 
time returning it to the company. Vanessa Merit Nornberg, owner of Metal Mafia, 
says most customers are surprised when they are told to just throw the item  away and 
that the company will replace it. Metal Mafia’s customers are happy with the com-
pany’s customer focus, which turns them into repeat customers and makes them 
eager to tell others about their shopping experience with the company.69 ■
The most successful small businesses have developed a customer focus and have 
instilled a customer satisfaction attitude throughout the company. They understand that 
t
winning customers for life requires practicing customer experience management, 
systematically creating the optimum experience for their customers every time they 
interact with the company. Companies with world-class customer experience manage-
ment attitudes set themselves apart by paying attention to “little things,” such as re-
sponding to questions or complaints promptly, remembering a customer’s unique product or 
service preferences, or sending a customer a copy of an article of interest to him or her. Small 
companies cannot always be leaders in creating product or technology innovations. However, 
because their size allows them to have more personal contact with their customers than large 
companies, small companies can develop experience innovations that keep customers coming
back and create a competitive advantage. Taking care of every small interaction a company has 
with its customers over time adds up to a positive service experience and can create a strong 
bond with them.

CHAPTER 8 • BUILDING A POWERFUL BOOTSTRAP MARKETING PLAN
331
In 1974, Bill Crutchfield was living in his mother’s house and work-
ing as the general manager of a forklift company after an un-
successful stint in Hollywood, where he tried to sell a screenplay
he wrote to a movie studio. He took $1,000 he had saved and
started a mail-order car stereo company after trying in vain to find 
a stereo that he could install himself in an old Porsche he was 
restoring for resale. Of course, Crutchfield needed far more than
$1,000 to start an electronics catalog company and was able to 
convince a local banker to extend a $25,000 line of credit to the 
new company, which he named Crutchfield after himself.
Crutchfield kept his job at the forklift company and ran his 
business as a one-man operation. After working all day, Crutch-
field would drive to the post office to pick up orders, drive to
his mother’s home where he was living, pack up the products 
with a personal thank-you note to ship to customers, and drive 
the packages to UPS for shipment. Unfortunately, only seven 
months into the venture, Crutchfield was incurring a loss and
was about to run out of cash. As a last-ditch effort, he sent a 
one-page questionnaire to everyone who had ordered a catalog, 
asking customers what the company could do better and non-
customers why they had not placed an order. Crutchfield says 
the responses he received not only saved his company but still
guide its customer service philosophy to this day. The problem
was not with the catalog’s products, brands, or prices; instead, 
customers were intimidated at the idea of installing a car stereo
on their own.
That feedback inspired Crutchfield to redesign his catalog 
(after all, it was the 1970s, long before the Internet) into a more 
polished product that included easy-to-follow articles on car ste-
reo installation techniques, step-by-step photographs, and cus-
tomer testimonials. The redesigned catalog worked, and sales 
increased dramatically in just a few months. That simple survey 
taught Crutchfield the importance of listening and responding 
to his customers, a lesson that has stuck with him for 40 years. 
Crutchfield’s product line has expanded to include more than
9,500 high-end audiovisual products ranging from flat-screen 
televisions to cameras and speaker systems. In the company’s re-
search department (yes, a retailer that manufactures no products 
has a research department), employees are busy dissecting the 
products Crutchfield sells so they can share the details of their
features and designs with the members of the sales, call center, 
and technical support teams. The technical support department 
routinely takes apart products to ensure they understand exactly 
how they work.
Digging into the details of every product the company sells 
is a vital component in the company’s customer service equation, 
but Crutchfield takes a broad view of customer service. Crutch-
field does not define customer service as only fixing problems once
they occur. The company tries to think like its customers and put 
in place customer support features to make the customer experi-
ence better. Toward that end, Crutchfield has developed detailed 
car stereo installation guides for more than 16,100 vehicles, many
of which contain how-to photos of the technical crew as they 
remove a factory radio and install one from the Crutchfield cata-
log. To enhance customers’ experience, Crutchfield also makes a 
significant investment in training its 500 employees. In addition to
the extensive training that technical support workers receive, sales 
advisers spend 13 weeks of classroom and hands-on installation 
training before they begin fielding customers’ calls.
Crutchfield’s focus on his customers pays off. The company 
generates $250 million in annual sales, is debt free, and has never 
experienced a layoff in its history. It has earned a five-star rat-
ing from Yelp and is the only retailer to win BizRate’s Circle of
Excellence award for 11 consecutive years. In 2007, Bill Crutchfield 
was inducted into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame, where
he joined the ranks of notables such as Steve Jobs and Thomas 
Edison.
Crutchfield’s passion for taking care of customers has never 
subsided even as the company grows. He recently penned a set 
of core values—including exceeding customers’ expectations,
passionately pursuing continuous improvement, and treating
employees with respect—that he explains to every employee in 
face-to-face meetings. Those core values are a significant part of 
the company’s hiring process, in which managers look for candi-
dates who demonstrate an attitude of service. Crutchfield believes 
that although you can train people for technical skills, it is critical 
for its business model to hire people who truly enjoy helping other 
people.
Although Internet sales now account for 70 percent of sales, 
catalogs remain an important part of the business; Crutchfield
mails more than 30 million of them each year. The company can 
never compete on price with Wal-Mart and the myriad of Internet
stores. The company competes with its high level of customer ser-
vice and its attention to its culture, which the Crutchfield refers to
as the company’s soul.
1. What impact has Crutchfield’s strategy of providing superior 
customer service had on the company’s success? In what 
ways does the company communicate its superior service 
strategy to customers?
2. Crutchfield makes it clear that his company does not 
compete with its rivals using low prices. What lessons can 
other small businesses learn from Crutchfield about the 
relationship between prices and customer service?

Fleischman brings along other employees, particularly recent hires to

Drexel Building Supply double its workforce over six years. Much of that

The goal is to create a total customer experience that is so positive that 
customers keep coming back and tell their friends about it.
How do these companies manage their customer relationships and 
stay focused so intently on their customers? They constantly ask cus-
tomers four basic questions and then act on what they hear:
1. What are we doing right?
2. How can we do that even better?
3. What have we done wrong?
4. What can we do in the future?
Table 8.4 offers some basic strategies for developing and retaining loyal customers.
BE DEVOTED TO QUALITY In this intensely competitive global business environment, quality goods 
and services are a prerequisite for success. According to one marketing axiom, the worst of all 
marketing catastrophes is to have great advertising and a poor-quality product. Customers have 
come to expect and demand quality goods and services, and those businesses that provide them 
consistently have a distinct competitive advantage. Today, quality is more than just a slogan posted on 
the company bulletin board; world-class companies treat quality as a strategic objective—an integral 
part of a company’s strategy and culture. This philosophy is called total quality management 
(TQM)—quality not just in the product or service itself but also in every aspect of the business and
its relationship with the customer and continuous improvement in the quality delivered to customers.
t
Companies on the cutting edge of the quality movement are developing new ways to mea-
sure quality. Manufacturers were the first to apply TQM techniques, but retail, wholesale, and 
service organizations have seen the benefits of becoming champions of quality. They are track-
ing customer complaints, contacting “lost” customers, and finding new ways to track the cost of 
quality and their return on quality (ROQ). ROQ recognizes that, although any improvement in 
quality may improve a company’s competitive ability, only those improvements that produce a 
reasonable rate of return are worthwhile. In essence, ROQ requires managers to ensure that the 
quality improvements they implement will more than pay for themselves.
The key to developing a successful TQM philosophy is seeing the world from the customer’s 
point of view. In other words, quality must reflect the needs and wants of the customer. TQM 
supports the value proposition of the business model. How do customers define quality? Accord-
ing to one survey, Americans rank the quality of a product in this order: reliability (average time 
between failures), durability (how long it lasts), ease of use, a known or trusted brand name, 
and, last, low price.71 When buying services, customers look for similar characteristics: tangibles 
(equipment, facilities, and people), reliability (doing what you say you will do), responsiveness 
(promptness in helping customers and in solving problems), and assurance and empathy (convey-
ing a caring attitude). For example, the owner of a very successful pest control company offers 
his customers a unique, unconditional guarantee: if the company fails to eliminate all insect 
and rodent breeding and nesting areas on a client’s premises, it will refund the customer’s last 
12 monthly payments and will pay for one year’s service by another exterminator. The company 
has had to honor its guarantee only once in 17 years.
Companies that excel at providing quality products and services discover tangible benefits in 
the form of increased sales, more repeat customers, higher customer retention, and lower costs.

TABLE 8.4 Strategies for Developing and Retaining Loyal Customers
● 
Identify your best customers and give them incentives to return. Focus resources on the 20 percent of 
customers who account for 80 percent of sales.
● 
When you create a dissatisfied customer, fix the problem fast. One study found that, given the 
chance to complain, 95 percent of customers will buy again if a business handles their complaints
f
promptly and effectively. The worst way to handle a complaint is to ignore it, to pass it off to a 
subordinate, or to let a lot of time slip by before dealing with it. Shortly after luxury car maker Lexus 
introduced the new ES 350 model, managers discovered that about 700 cars had a small transmission
problem that was the result of a factory error. Lexus contacted the affected owners and asked them 
to take their cars to their local dealers, where they received brand new Lexus 350s—no questions
asked. Surveys of these customers that were conducted later showed that they were more loyal to 
Lexus than buyers whose cars did not have the problem in the first place.
● 
Make sure your business system makes it easy for customers to buy from you. Eliminate unnecessary
procedures that challenge customers’ patience.
● 
Encourage customer complaints. You can’t fix something if you don’t know it’s broken. Find out 
what solution the customer wants and try to come as close to that as possible. Smart companies learn 
from customer complaints and use the feedback to make improvements in their products, services,
and processes.
● 
Contact lost customers to find out why they left. You may uncover a problem you never knew existed.
● 
Ask employees for feedback on improving customer service. A study by Technical Assistance
Research Programs, a customer service research firm, found that frontline service workers can 
predict nearly 90 percent of the cases that produce customer complaints. Emphasize that everyone is 
part of the customer satisfaction team.
● 
Get total commitment to superior customer service from top managers—and allocate resources 
appropriately.
● 
Allow managers to wait on customers occasionally. It’s a great dose of reality. Ron Shaich, founder 
of Panera Bread, a chain of bakery cafés with 1,185 locations in 40 states, still visits stores regularly, 
working the cash registers and serving customers so that he can listen to their ideas and concerns.
● 
Carefully select and train everyone who will deal with customers. Never let rude employees work 
with customers.
● 
Develop a service theme that communicates your attitude toward customers. Customers want to feel
they are getting something special.
● 
Empower employees to do whatever it takes to satisfy customers. At Ritz-Carlton hotels, employees 
are authorized to spend up to $2,000 to resolve a customer’s complaint. At Zappos, the online shoe 
retailer, members of the Customer Loyalty Team are authorized to spend as much time as necessary 
on the phone with customers and to assist with anything customers need, even those that are 
unrelated to Zappos.
● 
Reward employees “caught” providing exceptional service to customers.
● 
Get in the habit of calling customers by name. It’s one of the most meaningful ways of connecting 
with your customers.
● 
Remember: Customers pay the bills; without them, you have no business. Special treatment wins
customers and keeps them coming back.

Small businesses that have succeeded in building a reputation for top-quality products and ser-
vices rely on the following guidelines to “get it right the first time”:
● Build quality into the process; don’t rely on inspection to obtain quality.
● Foster teamwork and dismantle the barriers that divide disparate departments.

334
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
● Establish long-term ties with select suppliers; don’t award contracts on low price alone.
● Provide managers and employees the training needed to participate fully in the quality 
improvement program.
● Empower workers at all levels of the organization; give them authority and responsibility 
for making decisions that determine quality.
● Get managers’ commitment to the quality philosophy. Otherwise, the program is doomed. 
Employees look to leadership to see if quality is just talked about or actually a part of what 
the company does.
● Rethink the processes the company uses to get its products or services to its customers.
● Be willing to make changes in processes wherever they may be necessary.
● Reward employees for quality work. Ideally, workers’ compensation is linked clearly and 
directly to key measures of quality and customer satisfaction.
● Develop a company-wide strategy for constant improvement of product and service quality.
● Back up the company’s quality pledge with a guarantee. For instance, gSchool, a soft-
ware programming school in Denver, Colorado, guarantees all students a $60,000 job in 
Colorado as professional web developers after completing the program. Students who do 
not land such a job are guaranteed a full refund of their $20,000 tuition!72
ATTEND TO CONVENIENCE Ask customers what they want from the businesses they deal with,
and one of the most common responses is “convenience.” In this busy, fast-paced world of dual-
career couples and lengthy commutes to and from work, customers increasingly are looking for 
convenience. Several studies have found that customers rank easy access to goods and services
at the top of their purchase criteria. Unfortunately, too few businesses deliver adequate levels of 
convenience, and they fail to attract and retain customers. One print and framing shop, for instance,
alienated many potential customers with its abbreviated business hours—nine to five daily, except 
for Wednesday afternoons, Saturdays, and Sundays, when the shop was closed! Other companies 
make it a chore to do business with them. In an effort to defend themselves against unscrupulous 
customers, these businesses have created elaborate procedures for exchanges, refunds, writing 
checks, and other basic transactions.
Successful companies go out of their way to make sure that it is easy for customers to do
business with them. To provide their customers with a more convenient way to order, some res-
taurants are replacing printed menus with iPads. Stacked: Food Well Built, a southern California 
restaurant chain that offers 61 options just for a burger, uses iPads on every table that allow cus-
tomers to drag and drop ingredients with the touch of a finger to create the perfect burger, pizza, 
or salad. Customers also pay their bills without having to flag a waiter.73 At Do, an upscale pizza
restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia, that uses a similar concept, customers not only order and pay for 
their meals using the iPads on their tables but also can control the music they listen to and alert 
the valet that they are ready for their cars.74
Other restaurants are taking their food to customers in food trucks rather than waiting for 
customers to come to their brick-and-mortar locations. The Milk Truck, which travels to several 
locations in New York City, specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches and milkshakes. Customers 
can purchase gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches made from a variety of cheese from Wisconsin 
and Vermont and add ingredients such as champagne vinegar pickled onions, caramelized Granny 
Smith apples, whole grain Dijon mustard, fried eggs, and applewood smoked ham. Milkshake
flavors include Tahitian & Madagascar vanilla bean, dark chocolate, and crushed malted ball.75
Service companies are focusing on convenience as well. In Las Vegas, a couple can pull 
up into the Tunnel of Vows at the famous Little White Chapel, and an ordained minister at the 
drive-through window will marry them! Business has been so brisk that the owner of the chapel 
recently expanded the tunnel to include a ceiling adorned with cherubs and starlights.76
How can entrepreneurs boost the convenience level of their businesses? By conducting a 
“convenience audit” from the customer’s point of view to get an idea of its ETDBW (“Easy-to-
Do-Business-With”) index:

CHAPTER 8 • BUILDING A POWERFUL BOOTSTRAP MARKETING PLAN
335
● Is your business located near your customers? Does it provide easy access?
● Are your business hours suitable to your customers? Should you be open evenings and
weekends to serve them better?
● Would customers appreciate pickup and delivery service? To enhance customer 
convenience, nearly 25 percent of takeout restaurants, especially pizza and sandwich 
shops, give customers the option of ordering online and have discovered that customer 
satisfaction, order accuracy, and speed increase.77
● Are your employees trained to handle business transactions quickly, efficiently, and po-
litely? Waiting while rude, poorly trained employees fumble through routine transactions 
destroys customer goodwill.
● Do your employees treat customers with courtesy?
● Does your company provide a sufficient number of checkout stations so that shoppers do
not have to stand in long lines to pay for their purchases? Does your company make it easy 
for customers to make purchases with debit or credit cards?
● Are you using technology to enhance customers’ shopping experience? At Stop & Shop 
and Giant supermarkets in the Northeast, customers can pick up a smart phone–like device 
called Scan It that allows them to scan and bag their own groceries as they roam the stores’ 
aisles. The device shows a running total of their purchases and periodically provides elec-
tronic coupons based on customers’ purchases. Shoppers are happy because Scan It elimi-
nates long waits at the checkout counter, and the supermarkets are happy because Scan It 
shoppers spend 10 percent more on average.78
● Does your company offer “extras” that make customers’ lives easier? With a phone call
to Hoyt Hanvey Jewelers, a small gift store in Clinton, South Carolina, customers in need
of a special gift simply tell how much they want to spend, and the owner takes care of the 
rest—selecting the gift, wrapping it, and shipping it. All customers have to do is pay the
invoice when it arrives in the mail.
● Can you “bundle” some of your existing products or services to make it easier for 
customers to use them? Whether it involves gardening tools or a spa treatment, assembling
products and services into ready-made, all-in-one kits appeals to busy customers and can 
boost sales.
● Can you adapt existing products to make them more convenient for customers?
● Does your company handle telephone calls quickly, efficiently, and with a real person? 
Long waits “on hold,” transfers from one office to another, and too many rings before
answering signal to customers that they are not important. New services, such as Ruby 
Receptionists, give businesses the ability to have a real person answer the phone, rather 
than struggle through the frustration of navigating an automated answering system.
CONCENTRATE ON INNOVATION Innovation is the key to future success. Markets change too
quickly and competitors move too fast for a small company to stand still and remain competitive. 
Because they cannot outspend their larger rivals, small companies often turn to superior 
innovation as a way to gain a competitive edge. Thanks to their organizational and managerial 
flexibility, small businesses often can detect and act on new opportunities faster than large 
companies. Innovation is one of the hallmarks of entrepreneurs, and it shows up in the new 
products, unique techniques, and unusual marketing approaches they introduce. Despite their 
limited resources, small businesses frequently are leaders in innovation. There is much more to 
innovation than spending megadollars on research and development. How do small businesses 
manage to maintain their leadership role in innovating new products and services? They use their 
size to their advantage, maintaining their speed and flexibility much like a martial arts expert 
does against a larger opponent. Their closeness to their customers enables them to read subtle
shifts in the market and to anticipate trends as they unfold. Their ability to concentrate their 
efforts and attention in one area also gives small businesses an edge in innovation. One venture

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Fair Oaks Farms, LLC Fair Oaks Farms, LLC uses natural 
gas derived from the manure produced by its 30,000 milk cows to generate electricity to
power its 10 barns, cheese factory, gift store, restaurant, and educational center for children. How-
ever, electricity generation uses only half of the 5 million pounds of manure generated by the Fair
Oak Farms cows each day. Rather than burn off the excess gas, the farm is now using it to fuel its 
fleet of 42 tractor-trailer trucks. In addition to saving thousands of dollars in fuel costs, the farm  also
generates additional revenue from two fueling stations that are open to the general public.80 ■
EMPHASIZE SPEED Technology, particularly the Internet, has changed the pace of business so 
dramatically that speed has become a major competitive weapon. Today’s customers expect 
businesses to serve them at the speed of light! Providing a quality product at a reasonable price 
once was sufficient to keep customers happy, but that is not enough for modern customers 
who can find dozens of comparable products with a just few mouse clicks. Customers become
disgruntled when companies fail to show respect for their busy schedules and corresponding lack 
of time. At world-class companies, speed reigns. They recognize that reducing the time it takes 
to develop, design, manufacture, and deliver a product reduces costs, increases quality, improves 
customer satisfaction, and boosts market share.
This philosophy of speed is based on time compression management (TCM), which in-
volves three principles: (1) speeding new products to market, (2) shortening customer response time 
in manufacturing and delivery, and (3) reducing the administrative time required to fill an order.
Victory in this time-obsessed economy goes to the company that can deliver goods and services the
fastest, not necessarily those that are the biggest and most powerful. Businesses that can satisfy their 
customers’ insatiable appetites for speed have a distinct advantage. CarGurus, a popular Web site
for researching and purchasing autos, focuses on speed. Rather than ensuring perfection, CarGurus 
pushes new products out as soon as they satisfy customers’ basic requirements and then works on 
enhancements and changes over time. CEO Langley Steinert believes that, particularly with Web-
based businesses, speed is everything. For example, CarGurus recently launched a newsletter, but 
rather than trying to ensure it included every feature customers might want, the company published 
it as soon as it had basic functionality and added new features over time based on customer feed-
back. Steinert is convinced that if businesses wait too long to make innovations and introduce new
products, the speed of the Internet allows competitors to pass them by.81
Although speeding up the manufacturing process is a common goal, companies using TCM
have learned that manufacturing takes only 5 to 10 percent of the total time between an order and
getting the product into the customer’s hands. The rest is consumed by clerical and administrative 
tasks. The primary opportunity for TCM to improve speed is in what it can offer to streamline the 
administrative process. Companies relying on TCM to help them turn speed into a competitive
edge should do the following:
● “Reengineer” the entire process rather than attempt to do the same things in the same 
way—only faster. Peter Schultz, founder of Symyx, a small technology company in Santa 
Clara, California, applied the principles of rapid drug development used in the pharma-
ceutical industry to the field of materials science and changed the way new chemical 
compounds are created. Symyx’s technology allows its employees to test small amounts 
of chemicals and metals in parallel—up to 1,000 combinations per day—to create new
materials. Processes that not so long ago required two years of intense work now produce 
marketable results in less time.
● Create cross-functional teams of workers and give them the power to attack and solve 
problems. In world-class companies, product teams include engineers, manufacturing 
workers, salespeople, quality experts—even customers.
● Set aggressive goals for time reduction and stick to the schedule. Some companies using 
TCM have been able to reduce cycle time from several weeks to just a few hours!
● Rethink your supply chain. Can you electronically link with your suppliers or your 
customers to speed up orders and deliveries?

● Instill speed in the culture. At Domino’s Pizza, kitchen workers watch videos of the 
fastest pizza makers in the country.
● Use technology to find shortcuts wherever possible. Properly integrated into a company’s 
strategy for speed, technology can restructure a company’s operating timetable. Rather than 
build costly, time-consuming prototypes, many time-sensitive businesses use computer-
aided design and computer-assisted manufacturing to speed product design and testing.
● Put the Internet to work. Perhaps nothing symbolizes speed better than the Internet, and 
companies that harness its lightning-fast power can become leaders in TCM.
Conclusion
Small companies lack the marketing budgets of their larger rivals, but that does not condemn 
them to the world of second-class marketers and its resulting anonymity. By using clever, innova-
tive bootstrap marketing strategies such as the ones described in this chapter, entrepreneurs can 
put their companies in the spotlight and create a special connection with their customers.
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Describe the principles of building a bootstrap 
marketing plan, and explain the benefits of 
preparing one.
A major part of the entrepreneur’s business plan is the 
marketing plan, which focuses on a company’s target 
customers and how best to satisfy their needs and 
wants. A solid marketing plan should do the following:
● Determine customer needs and wants through mar-
ket research.
● Pinpoint the specific target markets the company
will serve.
● Analyze the firm’s competitive advantages and build 
a bootstrap marketing strategy around them.
2. Explain how small businesses can pinpoint 
their target markets.
Sound market research helps the owner pinpoint his or 
her target market. The most successful businesses have 
well-defined portraits of the customers they are seeking 
to attract.
3. Discuss the role of market research in building 
a bootstrap marketing plan and outline the 
market research process.
Market research is the vehicle for gathering the infor-
mation that serves as the foundation of the marketing 
plan. Good research does not have to be complex and
t
expensive to be useful. The steps in conducting market 
research include the following:
● Defining the objective: “What do you want 
to know?”
● Collecting the data from either primary or 
secondary sources.
● Analyzing and interpreting the data.
● Drawing conclusions and acting on them.
4. Describe how a small business can build a 
competitive edge in the marketplace using 
bootstrap marketing strategies.
When plotting a marketing strategy, owners must strive
to achieve a competitive advantage—some way to
make their companies different from and better than
the competition. Successful small businesses rely on
14 sources to develop a competitive edge:
● Find a niche and fill it.
● Use the power of publicity.
● Don’t just sell—entertain.
● Strive to be unique.
● Build a community with customers.
● Connect with the customer on an emotional level.
● Create an identity for your business through 
branding.
● Embrace social marketing.
● Be dedicated to service and customer satisfaction.
● Retain existing customers.
● Be devoted to quality.
● Pay attention to convenience.
● Concentrate on innovation.
● Emphasize speed.

CHAPTER 9 • E-COMMERCE AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
341
E-commerce has created a new way of doing business, one that is connecting producers, sellers,
and customers via technology in ways that have never been possible before. The result is a new 
set of companies built on business models that are turning traditional methods of selling on their 
heads. Companies that ignore the impact of the Internet on their markets and their operations 
run the risk of becoming as relevant to customers as a rotary-dial telephone. The most successful 
companies are embracing the Internet not merely as another advertising medium or marketing 
tool but as a mechanism for transforming their companies and changing everything about the way
they do business. As these companies discover innovative ways to use the Internet, social media,
computers, and mobile devices to serve their customers better and to connect with their suppliers, 
they are creating a new industrial order. In short, e-commerce has launched a revolution. Just as 
in previous revolutions in the business world, some old, established players are being ousted, and
new leaders are emerging. The winners are discovering new business opportunities, improved 
ways of designing work, and better ways of organizing and operating their businesses. Yet one 
lesson that entrepreneurs engaged in e-commerce have learned is that business basics still apply;
companies engaged in e-commerce still have to take care of their customers and earn a profit to 
stay in business. Web-based business success requires entrepreneurs to strike a balance, creating
an e-commerce strategy that capitalizes on the strengths of the Internet while meeting customers’ 
expectations of convenience and service.
In the world of e-commerce, new business models recognize the power the Internet gives 
customers, whether they buy online or offline. In 2017, online sales and Internet activity are 
projected to account for or influence 60 percent of total retail sales, or more than $2.16 trillion,
in the United States.1 The Internet makes pricing more transparent than ever before: With a few 
mouse clicks or swipes on a smart phone, customers can compare the prices of the same or similar 
products and services from companies across the globe. In the connected economy, the balance
of power is shifting to customers who comparison-shop, a habit they have retained since the 
last recession, and new business models must recognize this fact. Whatever products they may 
sell—from books and smart phones to cars and flowers—retailers are dealing with customers who 
are more informed and aware of the price and feature comparisons of the items for which they
are shopping. A survey by PriceWaterhouseCoopers reports that 83 percent of Americans (and 
80 percent of global shoppers) research products such as electronics, books, music, and movies
online before buying them. The survey also shows that 73 percent of Americans (and 60 percent of 
global shoppers) conduct online research on clothing, shoes, toys, and health and beauty products
before making purchases.2 These informed shoppers are taking price out of the buying equation, 
causing retailers to emphasize other factors, such as customer service, deep product lines, or con-
venience, to build long-term relationships.
The connection between online and offline business runs both ways. As a result of offline
exposure to a company’s ads, shoppers are likely to conduct online Web searches of the prod-
ucts and services they see advertised. In addition, customers value other shoppers’ opinions 
about the products they purchase and their shopping experiences with companies. A recent 
survey of shoppers in North America by BrightLocal, a company that specializes in local search 
engine optimization strategies, reports that 79 percent of consumers trust online reviews as 
much as personal recommendations.3 These trends point to the need for companies to market 
their products and services by taking a multichannel selling approach that includes the Inter-
net as one option. Modern shoppers expect to be able to purchase the products and services 
they want across multiple channels, including the Web, mobile devices, social media, tele-
vision shopping channels, catalogs, and brick-and-mortar stores. The multichannel approach
that today’s shoppers utilize blurs the boundaries between physical stores and the Internet. 
A company’s e-commerce strategy must recognize that modern consumers are always con-
nected and that a visit to a company’s Web site is just one component, albeit an important one, 
of a customer’s experience with a company. “Brands have limitless opportunities to interact 
with consumers through the entire buying decision process via multiple channels and media, 
whether it be in-store, online, via mobile, or social media,” says Alex Gonzalez, cofounder of 
Chatalog, an online social shopping tool.4

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Janet Holian: Gemvara Gemvara, a retailer of custom-
ized jewelry that once operated only online, recently opened its first physical retail store 
on Boston’s high-traffic Newbury Street, where shoppers can see and try on the pieces of jewelry 
that the company makes from 29 gemstones and 9 precious metals. Shoppers also can work with 
store employees to create their own custom designs just as they can online. “The [in-store]
Gemvara experience brings our online custom jewelry experience to life,” explains Janet Holian, 
Gemvara’s CEO.5 ■
In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, size doesn’t matter as much as speed and flexibility. 
One of the Internet’s greatest strengths is its interactive, social nature and its ability to provide
companies with instantaneous customer feedback, giving them the opportunity to learn and to 
make necessary adjustments. Businesses, whatever their size, that are willing to experiment with
different approaches to reaching customers and are quick to learn and adapt will grow and pros-
per; those that cannot will fall by the wayside. E-commerce is transforming the way businesses in 
almost every industry operate, including the retail auto business. “The whole process of buying a 
car has been flipped from what it used to be,” says Alison Spitzer, vice-president of Spitzer Auto 
Group in Elyria, Ohio. Rather than spend most of their time in dealerships comparing models and 
prices, customers today walk into a showroom having already researched online the features and 
reviews of various models and equipped with the car’s invoice price, manufacturers’ discounts, 
and competing bids from several dealers. Research by AutoTrader Group shows that car shop-
pers spend an average of 11 hours conducting research online and just 3.5 hours researching cars 
offline, including trips to dealerships. “Everything is transparent for the customers,” says Tia 
Morris, a salesperson at Nissan of Manhattan. Morris, whose title is “product specialist,” says her 
job is “helping customers find the right car and make a smart choice.”6
A Nielsen study of global e-commerce trends reports that 84 percent of the world’s online 
population has used the Internet to make a purchase, up from 40 percent in 2006. The items pur-
chased most often online are apparel, books, computer hardware and software, toys, videogames,
and health and beauty products.7 However, companies can—and do—sell practically anything 
over the Web, from antiques and groceries to skeletons (animal and human) and Russian military 
tanks. eMarketer estimates that nearly 9.0 percent of total retail sales in the United States will
occur online in 2018, totaling more than $491 billion (see Figure 9.1).8

Companies of all sizes are busy establishing a presence on the Internet because that’s where 
their customers are. The number of Internet users worldwide now stands at more than 2.4 billion, 
up from 147 million in 1998 (see Figure 9.2).9 Consumers have adopted the Internet much more 
quickly than any other major innovations in the past. It reached 50 percent penetration in the 
United States in just 7 years, compared to 30 years for the computer, 40 years for electricity, and 
more than 100 years for steam power.10

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Factors to Consider before Launching  
into E-Commerce
The first e-commerce transaction took place on August 11, 1994, when NetMarket, a small com-
pany founded by recent college graduate Daniel Kohn, sold a CD by Sting, Ten Summoner’s
Tales, to a student at Swarthmore College for $12.48 plus shipping.11 From these humble be-
ginnings grew a distribution channel that now accounts for $304 billion in annual retail sales.12
Despite the many benefits the Internet offers, however, not every small business owner is ready to 
embrace e-commerce. According to a recent survey by the National Small Business Association,
82 percent of small business owners in the United States have Web sites, more than two-and-a-
half times as many that were operating online in 1997. However, 28 percent of small businesses
with Web sites do not actually engage in e-commerce because their Web sites cannot process cus-
tomer payments. The primary reasons that business owners give for not having a Web site is that 
they believe that a Web site is not necessary for their company (27 percent), creating and main-
taining a site is too difficult (19 percent), and operating a Web site is too costly (12 percent).13
The blurring of the boundaries among the Internet, social media, and brick-and-mortar store-
fronts has changed the way companies interact with their customers. The RoomPlace, a 100-year-
old chain of 21 retail furniture stores in Illinois and Indiana, recently redesigned its entire Web 
site using feedback from users and Web analytics. The new site shows pictures of entire rooms
of furniture sold as bundles so that shoppers can see how a finished room would look. The site 
emphasizes cross-selling by showing related pieces of furniture and accessories for items that 
customers view or select. The redesigned site also includes a more visible “add to cart” button
that encourages shoppers to buy. The RoomPlace added zoom features that enable shoppers to see
product details. Recognizing that many customers want to see, touch, and sit in furniture before 
making a purchase, The RoomPlace has incorporated multiple purchase options for customers, for 
example, allowing them to research online and purchase in-store or to research in-store and buy 
online. Within three months of the site’s redesign, the company’s sales increased 20 percent, its
average order value increased 25 percent, and the site’s conversion rate improved by 26 percent.14
Like The RoomPlace, small businesses have been allocating more resources to their 
e-commerce efforts, investing in developing and updating their Web sites, optimizing their sites to 
achieve top search engine rankings, and encouraging customers to post reviews of their businesses,
products, and services. Before launching an e-commerce effort, entrepreneurs should consider the 
following important strategic issues:
● The way in which a company exploits the Internet’s interconnectivity and the opportunities 
it creates to transform relationships with its suppliers and vendors, its customers, and other 
external stakeholders are crucial to its success.
● Success requires a company to develop a plan for integrating the Internet into its overall busi-
ness strategy. The plan should address issues such as Web site design and maintenance, creating 
and managing a brand name, marketing and promotional strategies, sales, and customer service.
● Developing deep, lasting relationships with customers takes on even greater importance 
on the Internet. Attracting online customers costs money, and companies must be able to
retain their online customers to make their Web sites profitable. That means that online 
companies must give their customers good reasons to keep coming back.
● Creating a meaningful presence on the Internet requires an ongoing investment of 
resources—time, money, energy, and talent. Establishing an attractive Web site brimming 
with catchy photographs and descriptions of products is only the beginning.
● Measuring the success of its Internet-based sales effort is essential if a company is to 
remain relevant to customers whose tastes, needs, and preferences are always changing.
Using Web analytics to continuously improve a Web site is essential.
Doing business on the Internet takes more time and energy than many entrepreneurs expect. 
The following six factors are essential to achieving e-commerce success:
● Acquiring customers. The first e-commerce skill that entrepreneurs must master is acquir-
ing customers, which requires them to drive traffic to their Web sites. Entrepreneurs must 
LO1

CHAPTER 9 • E-COMMERCE AND THE ENTREPRENEUR

develop a strategy for using the many available tools, which range from display ads and 
Google Adwords to social media and search marketing.
● Optimizing conversions. Every online entrepreneur’s goal is to convert Web site visitors 
into paying customers. The efficiency with which an online company achieves this goal 
plays a significant role in determining its profitability. Unfortunately, more than 97 percent 
of visitors to the typical retail Web site do not purchase anything.
● Maximizing Web site performance. Once shoppers find a company’s Web site, they should 
encounter a site that downloads quickly, is easy to navigate, and contains meaningful con-
tent they can find quickly and efficiently. A fast, simple checkout process also is essential.
Otherwise, shoppers will abandon the site, never to return.
● Ensuring a positive user experience. Achieving customer satisfaction online is just as 
important as it is offline. Visitors who are satisfied with a site are 71 percent more likely 
to purchase from the site (and 67 percent more likely to purchase in the future) than 
visitors who are dissatisfied.15 An above-average bounce rate (the percentage of single-
page visits to a Web site) and shopping cart abandonment rate and a conversion rate that 
is below average are signs that a company’s Web site is not providing a positive customer 
experience.
● Retaining customers. Just as in offline stores, customer retention is essential to the suc-
cess of online businesses. One study reports that increasing customer retention by 2 percent 
produces the same financial impact as reducing costs by 10 percent.16 Entrepreneurs must 
create an online shopping experience that engages customers, offers them value, and pro-
vides them with convenience.
● Use Web analytics as part of a cycle of continuous improvement. Entrepreneurs have 
a multitude of Web analytics tools (many of them free) that they can use to analyze the 
performance and effectiveness of their Web sites. A Web site is never really “finished”;
it is always a work in progress, and analytics tools provide the data for driving continu-
ous improvement. Unfortunately, a survey conducted by The Incyte Group and SiteApps 
reports that 75 percent of small business owners do not use analytics tools to measure their 
Web sites’ performance. “Small businesses know how important their web presence is for 
presenting a desirable online identity and attracting new customers, yet don’t fully under-
stand how to achieve those goals, implement new technologies, or adapt to new trends as
deftly as larger companies,” says Phillip Klien, CEO of SiteApps.17
We will explain how to achieve these six goals in the “Strategies for E-Success” section of this 
chapter.
Ten Myths of E-Commerce
Although many entrepreneurs have made their fortunes through e-commerce, setting up shop on 
the Internet is no guarantee of success. Scores of entrepreneurs have plunged unprepared into 
the world of e-commerce only to discover that there is more to it than merely setting up a Web 
site and waiting for orders to start pouring in. Make sure that you do not fall victim to one of the 
following e-commerce myths.
Myth 1. If I Launch a Site, Customers Will Flock to It
Some entrepreneurs think that once they set up their Web sites, their expenses end there. Not true! 
Without promotional support, no Web site will draw enough traffic to support a business. With 
more than 785 million Web sites in existence and 51 million added each year, getting a site no-
ticed in the crowd has become increasingly difficult.18 Listing a site with popular search engines 
does not guarantee that online customers will find your company’s Web site. Just like traditional 
retail stores seeking to attract customers, virtual companies have discovered that drawing suffi-
cient traffic to a Web site requires constant promotion—and lots of it! Setting up a Web site and 
then failing to drive customers to it with adequate promotional support is like setting up a physi-
cal store in a back alley: You may be in business, but nobody knows you’re there!

Explain the 10 myths  
of e-commerce and how  
to avoid falling victim  
to them.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Entrepreneurs with both physical and virtual stores must promote their Web sites at every 
opportunity by printing their Uniform Resource Locators (URLs; a company’s address on the
Internet) on everything related to their physical stores—on signs, in print and broadcast ads, on 
shopping bags, on merchandise labels, on employees’ uniforms, and anywhere else their custom-
ers will see. Quick-response (QR) codes allow smart phone users to go directly to a Web site’s 
relevant page without having to type in a long URL. Entrepreneurs also use social media such 
as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and others to drive traffic to their Web sites
and purchase ads on high-traffic sites such as Google (Google Adsense) and Facebook, both of 
which allow companies to establish maximum expenditures based on the number of people who 
click on their ads. Using these tools, companies can aim their ads at specific target customers by 
location, age, and interests.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Mehdi Farsi, Reza Farsi,
and Eric Ferguson: State Bicycle Mehdi Farsi, Reza 
Farsi, and Eric Ferguson, owners of State Bicycle, a manufacturer
of quality fixed-gear and single-speed bicycles in Tempe, Arizona, 
uses Facebook ads to increase its brand recognition, drive new 
customers to its Web site, and build stronger relationships with
existing customers. In addition to adding milestones to the com-
pany’s Facebook page to promote significant events and accom-
plishments, the entrepreneurs also ran Facebook ads to people 
living in cities whose profiles indicated that they were bicyclists or 
were interested in fixed-gear bicycles (known as “fixies”). They 
also hosted frequent photo contests on the company Facebook 
page (e.g., the owner of the “most beaten up bike” won a new 
State Bicycle bike) and ran “Facebook Friday” specials that in-
cluded a discount coupon for people who liked the company on 
Facebook. With only a minimal investment in Facebook ads, the
entrepreneurs realized an additional $500,000 in sales in just one 
year and saw the number of likes increase tenfold in the same 
time period.19 ■
Entrepreneurs also should consider buying ads in traditional advertising media as well as us-
ing banner ads, banner exchange programs, and cross-marketing arrangements with companies 
that sell complementary products on their own Web sites. The keys to promoting a Web site are 
networking—building relationships with other companies, customers, trade associations, online
directories, and other Web sites that your company’s customers visit—and interacting with exist-
ing and potential customers online through social media outlets.
Myth 2. Online Customers Are Easy to Please
Customers who shop online today tend to be experienced Internet users whose expectations of 
their online shopping experiences are high and continue to rise. Experienced online shoppers 
tend to be unforgiving, quickly clicking to another site if their shopping experience is subpar or 
they cannot find the products and information they want. Because Web shoppers are increasingly 
more discriminating, companies are finding that they must improve their Web sites constantly to 
attract and keep their customers.
To be successful online marketers, small companies must create Web sites with the fea-
tures that appeal to experienced Web shoppers, such as simple navigation; customer reviews;
an efficient checkout process; multiple payment options; rock-solid security; quick access to 
product information, videos, and blogs; and the ability to track their shipments online. In ad-
dition, when customers have questions about or experience problems with an online shopping
experience, companies that provide easy access to customer assistance and support have the
advantage. Giving customers easy access to service representatives through multiple options,
such as a toll-free telephone number, live chat, click-to-call, live video chat, and texting (for 
the growing number of customers who shop from their smart phones and other mobile devices) 
increases the probability that they will complete their transactions and return to shop again. The 
payoff for creating a positive online experience for shoppers is significant: Customers are more

likely to trust the company, complete their purchases, buy from the company again, recommend 
the company to someone else, and mention it favorably in social media posts. Conversely, a poor 
online shopping experience translates into shoppers who abandon their shopping carts, have a
negative impression of the company, lose trust in the business, and as a result, purchase from a
competing Web site.20
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: David Byun: AccessoryGeeks AccessoryGeeks, an on-
line company that sells smart phone, iPod, and iPad accessories, recently redesigned its 
Web site to make customers’ shopping experience easier and better. The company added tabs that
allow shoppers to browse its product line by product, manufacturer, or brand and a search tool
that enables customers to find a particular accessory even faster. Higher quality photos and more 
detailed product descriptions are designed to appeal to the company’s more discriminating cus-
tomer base. For customers for whom the FAQ section does not satisfy, AccessoryGeeks employees 
now respond to customer e-mails around the clock and send text messages to people shopping 
from mobile devices, which now generate 15 percent of the company’s sales. As part of the rede-
sign, the company also added customer reviews and a live chat option. To encourage repeat shop-
ping, the company now awards “Geek Points” for each purchase that shoppers can redeem for
discounts, merchandise, and prizes. “Online customers demand more and more as time goes on,” 
says David Byun, AccessoryGeeks’ president.21 ■
Myth 3. Making Money on the Web Is Easy
Promoters who hawk “get-rich-quick” schemes on the Internet lure many entrepreneurs with the 
promise that making money online is easy. It isn’t. Doing business online can be very profitable, 
but making money online requires an up-front investment of time, money, and energy. Success 
online also requires a sound business strategy that is aimed at the appropriate target audience and 
that an entrepreneur must implement effectively and efficiently—in other words, the same ele-
ments that are required for success offline. Many entrepreneurs are earning healthy profits from 
their Web-based businesses, but doing so requires hard work!
As thousands of new sites spring up every day, getting a company’s site noticed requires
more effort and marketing muscle than ever before. Attracting customers to a Web site is really 
no different from attracting customers to a brick-and-mortar store; entrepreneurs must define 
their target customers, devise a marketing plan to reach them, and offer them good value and 
superior customer service to keep them coming back. Successful e-tailers have discovered that 
promoting their Web sites via social media and providing comprehensive FAQ (frequently 
asked questions) pages, e-mail order confirmations and shipment notices, and highly visible 
telephone and e-mail contact information followed by quick responses enhance their reputa-
tions for online customer service.
Myth 4. Privacy Is Not an Important Issue on the Web
The Internet allows companies to gain access to almost unbelievable amounts of information 
about their customers’ online behavior. Tracking tools monitor customers’ behavior while they 
are on a site, giving Internet-based businesses the information they need to make their Web sites 
more customer friendly. Many sites also offer visitors “freebies” in exchange for information 
about themselves. Companies then use this information to learn more about their target custom-
ers and how to market to them more effectively. Concern over privacy and the proper use of this 
information has become the topic of debate by many interested parties, including government 
agencies, consumer watchdog groups, and customers themselves. The TRUSTe Privacy Index 
reports that 89 percent of adults in the United States worry about their privacy online, and the 
same percentage of U.S. adults avoid doing business with companies that they believe do not 
protect their privacy online.22
Companies that collect information from their online customers must safeguard their cus-
tomers’ privacy, protect the information they collect from unauthorized use, and use it respon-
sibly. That means that businesses should post a privacy policy on their Web sites, explaining to
customers how they intend to use the information they collect. Then they must be sure to follow 
it! One of the surest ways to alienate online customers is to abuse the information collected from 
them by selling it to third parties or by spamming customers with unwanted solicitations.

348
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Many customers don’t trust Web sites, especially those of companies they don’t know. One 
recent survey reports that 43 percent of U.S. adults do not trust online businesses with their per-
sonal information.23 In addition, 17 percent of online shoppers have abandoned their shopping 
carts because of security concerns.24 Therefore, a key component of a successful e-commerce
effort, especially for small companies that tend to be less well known, is building trust among 
customers. Posting security icons from TRUSTe, BBBOnline, McAfee, WhiteHat, Thawte, and 
other certification services assures customers that a site meets security standards. Another way 
that businesses can build trust is to create meaningful privacy policies, post them on their Web
sites, and then adhere to them. According to John Briggs, director of e-commerce for the Yahoo 
Network, customers “need to trust the brand they are buying and believe that their online pur-
chases will be safe transactions. They need to feel comfortable that [their] personal data will not 
be sold and that they won’t get spammed by giving their e-mail address. They need to know about 
shipping costs, product availability, and return policies up front.”25 Privacy does matter on the 
Web, and businesses that respect and protect their customers’ privacy win their customers’ trust. 
Trust is the foundation on which the long-term customer relationships that are so crucial to Web
success are built.
Myth 5. “Strategy? I Don’t Need a Strategy to Sell on the Web!  
Just Give Me a Web Site, and the Rest Will Take Care of Itself”
Building a successful e-business is no different than building a successful brick-and-mortar busi-
ness. It requires a well-thought-out strategy. Building a strategy means an entrepreneur must 
first develop a clear definition of the company’s target audience and a thorough understanding of 
those customers’ needs, wants, likes, and dislikes. To be successful, a Web site must be appealing 
to the customers it seeks to attract just as a traditional store’s design and decor must draw foot 
traffic. If a Web site is to become the foundation for a successful e-business, an entrepreneur must 
create it with the target audience in mind.
Recall from Chapter 5 that one goal of developing a strategy is to set a business apart from
t
its competition. The same is true for creating a strategy for conducting business online. It is just 
as important, if not more important, for an online business to differentiate itself from the compe-
tition if it is to be successful. Unlike customers in a retail store, who must exert the effort to go 
to a competitor’s store if they cannot find what they want, online customers only have to make 
a mouse click or two to go to a rival Web site. Competition online is fierce, and to succeed, a 
company must have a sound strategy.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Bryan DeLuca, Matt Fry, 
Tom Browning, Matt McClard, and Kelly Largent: Foot 
Cardigan Two weeks into a three-month trip to Europe with his
wife, Bryan DeLuca ran out of socks. After purchasing “a 10-pack of 
wacky-designed socks in a retail shop in London,” DeLuca says the 
socks became part of his everyday wardrobe, even after he returned 
from his trip. The socks generated many comments and questions, 
inspiring DeLuca to start an online business selling funky socks. He 
worked with four friends, Matt Fry, Tom Browning, Matt McClard, 
and Kelly Largent, all of whom are experienced entrepreneurs and 
brought a unique skill sets to the business, to launch Foot Cardigan, 
an e-commerce company based in Dallas, Texas. The entrepreneurs 
decided to base their business model on a subscription service that
“delivers one random pair of crazy socks to your mailbox every 
month.” They also kept their day jobs, utilized the lean start-up 
method, and followed the minimum viable product philosophy. “It’s
the least amount a business needs to work at the most basic level,” 
explains DeLuca. “Nothing is ever really ‘ready’ to launch. Just get it
out there.” The philosophy involves testing almost everything about a business before committing 
significant resources to it. Foot Cardigan’s cofounders tested their subscription business model, 
their products (all of the company’s socks are original designs and are available nowhere else), 
and the company name to see how customers would respond. “We don’t want to put time and 
money behind something that people really don’t want,” he says. “If your testing shows that 
people want it, create it. If it doesn’t, don’t.” Already with more than 2,000 subscribers and

growing fast, Foot Cardigan is profitable and has exceeded the young entrepreneurs’ expecta-
tions. Their next step is to expand into international markets.26 ■
Myth 6. The Most Important Part of Any E-Commerce Effort Is Technology
Technology advances have reduced significantly the cost of launching an e-commerce business. 
Brian Walker, an e-commerce expert at Forrester Research, says that a just decade ago, the cost to 
launch an online retail business was three to five times higher than it is today. “The technology to
run the site, the physical warehouse, site hosting, and staff required a significant investment be-
fore the site even went live,” says Walker.27 Modern e-commerce entrepreneurs can build a Web 
site for next to nothing, outsource the tasks of storing and shipping products, lease space on a 
server, and rent cloud-computing software to operate their online businesses—all of which lower 
the cost and the complexity of starting an online company. Julie Wainwright says building the
e-commerce company that she helped launch in 1998 cost between $7 million and $10 million 
(not including the cost of inventory). Wainwright recently launched an online luxury clothing 
marketplace called TheRealReal at a cost of only $25,000 to $30,000.28
As important as having the right technology to support an e-commerce business is, it 
is not the most crucial ingredient in the recipe for success. What matters most is the ability 
t
to understand the underlying business and to develop a workable business model that offers 
customers something of value at a reasonable price and produces a profit for the company. 
The entrepreneurs who are proving to be most successful in e-commerce are those who know 
how their industries work inside and out and then build an e-business around that knowl-
edge. They know they can hire Web designers, database experts, and fulfillment companies to 
handle the technical aspects of their online businesses, but nothing can substitute for a solid
understanding of inner workings of their industry, their target market, and the strategy needed 
to pull the various parts of the business model together. The key is seeing the Web for what it 
really is: another way to reach and serve customers with an effective business model and to 
minimize the cost of doing business.
Some entrepreneurs tackle e-commerce by focusing on technology first and then determin-
ing how that technology fits their business idea. “If you start with technology, you’re likely to 
going to buy a solution in search of a problem,” says Kip Martin, program director of META 
Group’s Electronic Business Strategies. Instead, he suggests, “Start with the business and ask 
yourself what you want to happen and how you’ll measure it. Then ask how the technology will 
help you achieve your goals. Remember: Business first, technology second.”29
Myth 7. Customer Service Is Not as Important Online  
as It Is in a Traditional Retail Store
The Internet offers the ultimate in shopping convenience. Numerous studies report that conve-
nience and low prices are the primary drivers of online shopping. In fact, customers say conve-
nience is more important than getting the lowest prices when shopping online.30 With just a few 
mouse clicks or taps on the screen of a smart phone or tablet, people can shop for practically 
anything anywhere in the world and have it delivered to their doorsteps within days. As conve-
nient as online shopping is, customers still expect high levels of service. Unfortunately, some 
e-commerce companies treat customer service as an afterthought, an attitude that costs busi-
nesses in many ways, including lost customers and a diminished public image. The fact is that 
customer service is just as important (if not more so) on the Web as it is in traditional brick-and-
mortar stores.
The average conversion rate for e-commerce sites is just 2.55 percent.31 In other words,
out of 1,000 visitors to the typical company’s Web site, only about 26 of them actually make a 
purchase! Sites that are slow to load and/or difficult to navigate, suffer from complicated check-
out systems, or confuse shoppers turn customers away, and many of them never return. Only 
28 percent of e-commerce businesses are satisfied with their conversion rates.32
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Dan Gerler: OnlineShoes.com Dan Gerler, CEO of
OnlineShoes.com, a family-owned chain of retail stores based in Seattle, Washington, that 
became the first online shoe retailer in 1996, was determined to increase the company’s conver-
sion rate by making its Web site easier for customers to browse and buy. Web analytics showed

350
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Lynn Stetson, the company’s director of e-commerce, marketing, and merchandising, that at 
checkout, many customers had neglected to select a shoe size, forcing them to backtrack to com-
plete their purchases. Many customers simply abandoned their shopping carts. Stetson added a
pop-up reminder that alerted shoppers when they failed to specify a size and included text next
to the “add to cart” button that emphasized the company’s key selling points: free shipping and
exchanges and 365-day-a-year returns. The result was a 20 percent increase in OnlineShoes.com’s 
conversion rate.33 ■
There is plenty of room for improvement in customer service on the Web. Shoppers’ unmet 
expectations of superior customer service translate into a high shopping cart abandonment rate. 
Research shows that 67 percent of online shoppers who fill their online shopping carts abandon 
them without checking out, costing businesses a whopping $1.79 trillion in lost sales. The cart 
abandonment rate jumps to 97 percent for shoppers who use mobile devices.34 Figure 9.3 shows 
the leading causes of shopping cart abandonment. When customers abandon their shopping carts, 
companies can close a significant percentage of those “lost” sales by sending prompt follow-up 
“triggered” e-mails designed to convince customers to complete their purchases. On average, 
20 percent of shoppers who abandon their carts and receive follow-up (“re-targeted”) e-mails from 
the company (sooner is better) return to complete their purchases, often spending more than shop-
pers who completed their purchases without abandoning their carts.35 One recent study concludes
that companies that send retargeted e-mails generate an average of $17.90 in revenue per e-mail
sent. Including an offer for free shipping to customers who
abandon their shopping carts is one of the most effective 
ways to convince them to complete their purchases.36

specialist, they recently focused their attention on online customers who had filled shopping carts 
and then abandoned them. The customers received two retargeted e-mails. The first one, sent just
three hours after the abandonment and including the shopper’s name and a list of the virtual 
cart’s contents, generated an impressive conversion rate of 36 percent, nearly 11 times the aver-
age e-mail conversion rate of 3.34 percent. Shoppers who did not respond to the first e-mail 
received a second one two days later, which produced a conversion rate of 29 percent. Lush
Cosmetics also began another successful e-mail campaign designed to recapture customers who
had not made a purchase within the previous six months. This “We miss you!” campaign produced 
an above-average conversion rate of 10 percent.37 ■
One tool that increases a company’s conversion rate and reduces its cart abandonment rate is 
live help. In fact, a study by Oracle reports that 57 percent of customers say that live help is one of 
the most important features a Web site can offer.38 For reasonable fees, companies can hire virtual 
assistants, employees who work remotely to answer online shoppers’ questions or to offer advice 
(for example, whether an item’s sizes tend to run small) in real time. Even small companies that 
cannot afford to staff a live chat center can offer customer-responsive chat options on their Web 
sites by using virtual chat agents. Loaded onto a company’s site, these avatar-like creations can 
step in at the appropriate time to interact with customers, answering their questions or giving 
them the extra nudge they need, such as an offer of free shipping, to close the deal.
In an attempt to improve the level of service they offer, many sites provide e-mail links to en-
courage customer interaction. Unfortunately, when responding to e-mail takes a very low priority 
at some e-businesses, customers take it as a clear sign of poor service. The lesson for e-commerce 
entrepreneurs is simple: Devote time, energy, and money to developing an effective system for 
providing superior customer service. Those who do will build a sizable base of loyal customers
who will keep coming back.
Myth 8. Flashy Web Sites Are Better Than Simple Ones
Businesses that fall into this trap pour significant amounts of money into designing flashy Web 
sites with all of the “bells and whistles.” The logic is that to stand out online, a site really has to 
sparkle. That logic leads to a “more-is-better” mentality when designing a site. On the Internet, 
however, “more” does not necessarily equate to “better.” A Web site that includes a simple de
t
-
sign, easy navigation, clear calls to action on every page, and consistent color schemes show that 
a company is putting its customers first. A site that performs efficiently and loads quickly is a far 
better selling tool than one that is filled with “cornea gumbo,” slow to download, and confusing 
to shoppers. “Every millisecond counts,” says Arvind Jain, an engineer at Google.39 Sites that 
download slowly usually never have the chance to sell because customers click to another site. 
The time required to download a Web site is one of the most important determinants of its sales 
effectiveness. Studies show that sites that load slowly have higher bounce rates and lower conver-
sion rates as customers abandon them for faster loading sites (see Figure 9.4).40 One study reports 
that a one-second delay in a site’s page-load time results in a 7 percent reduction in its conversion 
rate.41 In addition, Web sites that load faster earn higher rankings on search engines.42

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
To online customers, whose expectations concerning online speed continue to escalate, a
good online shopping experience is a fast, uncomplicated one. Successful e-tailers set their sights
on meeting the two-second rule: if a Web site does not download within two seconds, users are
likely to abandon it. If a Web site takes more than three seconds to load, 40 percent of online shop-
pers will abandon it.43 Proper content, formatting, and design are important ingredients in deter-
mining a site’s performance. Smart e-tailers frequently test their sites on performance, speed, and 
reliability measures in different browsers using a variety of online tools such as Dotcom-Monitor,
WebPageTest, and others. The lesson: Keep the design of your site simple so that pages download
in no more than two seconds, and make sure that the site’s navigation is easy and intuitive.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jason Marrone: Jelly Belly Candy Company Jelly Belly 
Candy Company, a company that sells jelly beans in a multitude of flavors, recently 
redesigned its Web site to follow a simpler, “minimalistic approach,” says e-commerce director 
Jason Marrone. “We needed less clutter and more focus on the product.” The company also up-
graded the site’s navigation and search capabilities, giving shoppers the ability to search for jelly 
beans by color, taste, package type, or occasion. Filters for price, color, and container size allow 
them to narrow their choices further. “People can find what they want more easily now,” says
Marrone. “It’s making a difference.” Since the redesign, Jelly Belly’s conversion rate has increased 
38 percent, and its average order value has gone up by 15 percent.44 ■
Myth 9. It’s What’s Up Front That Counts
Designing an attractive, efficient Web site and driving traffic to it are important to building a suc-
cessful e-business. However, designing the back office, the systems that take over once customers 
place their orders on a Web site, is just as important as designing the site itself. If the behind-the-
scenes support is not in place or cannot handle the traffic from the Web site, a company’s entire 
e-commerce effort will come crashing down. The potentially large number of orders that a Web
site can generate can overwhelm a small company that has failed to establish the infrastructure 
needed to support the site. Although e-commerce can lower many costs of doing business, it still
requires a basic infrastructure in the channel of distribution to process orders, maintain inventory, 
fill orders, and handle customer service. “The companies with warehouses, supply-chain man-
agement, and solid customer service are going to be the ones that survive,” says Daryl Plummer, 
head of the Gartner Group’s Internet and new media division.45
To customers, a business is only as good as its last order. Web-based entrepreneurs often
discover that the greatest challenge their businesses face is not necessarily attracting customers 
on the Web but creating a viable order fulfillment strategy. Order fulfillment involves everything
required to get goods from a warehouse into a customer’s hands and includes order processing, 
warehousing, picking and packing, shipping, and billing.
Some entrepreneurs choose to handle order fulfillment in-house with their own employees,
whereas others find it more economical to hire specialized fulfillment houses to handle these 
functions. Virtual order fulfillment (or drop shipping) suits many small e-tailers perfectly. 
When a customer orders a product from its Web site, the company forwards the order to a whole-
saler or distributor who then ships the product to the customer with the online merchant’s label 
on it. This strategy allows a small business to avoid the cost and the risk of carrying inventory. 
Danny Wong and Fan Bi, cofounders of Blank Label, an online retailer of custom-made men’s 
shirts, found a manufacturer in Shanghai, China, that was willing to build shirts to the specifi-
cations (fabric, size, collar style, cuff type, button color, and more) that shoppers identify on 
the Blank Label Web site and drop ship them directly to customers. Their fulfillment strategy 
minimizes the risk that the entrepreneurs, both in their early twenties, incur and has enabled their 
company to become one of the fastest-growing online companies in the United States.46
Although e-tailers who use virtual order fulfillment avoid the major investments in inventory 
and the problems associated with managing it, they lose control over delivery times and service 
quality. In addition, finding a fulfillment house willing to handle a relatively small volume of orders 
at a reasonable price can be difficult for some small businesses. Major fulfillment providers that 
focus on small companies include Amazon, Federal Express, UPS, DHL, ShipWire, Webgistix,
and WeFullfillIt. Some businesses integrate their brick-and-mortar stores into their online order

fulfillment strategies. They maximize customer convenience by allowing customers to order 
online and pick up their items (or return them if necessary) to a physical store. Other companies 
use a ship-from-store fulfillment strategy, in which they fill online orders totally or in part from 
the inventory in their brick-and-mortar stores. Doing so maximizes the selection of merchandise 
from which customers can choose but requires the company to manage its inventory carefully to 
avoid starving its physical stores of goods if online demand surges.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ned Hamilton: Peter Glenn Ski and Sport Peter Glenn
Ski and Sport, a chain of 11 ski and outdoor apparel stores founded in 1958 by Ned Hamilton
and headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was an early adopter of the ship-from-store strat-
egy. The company typically uses in-store inventory to fill between 10 and 40 percent of its online 
orders, which maximizes its inventory flexibility and enables it to test new products and brands. 
Peter Glenn Ski and Sport fills the rest of its orders from its dedicated e-commerce fulfillment cen-
ter. “Given that ski and snowboard clothing is so fashion driven, we always need to offer the broad-
est selection possible in our stores and online while at the same time mitigating our inventory risk,” 
says Jason Merrick, the company’s e-commerce director. “We can experiment [with new products] 
with a lot more confidence because we have the extra selling channel on the Web.”47 ■
Myth 10. My Business Doesn’t Need a Web Site
Nearly one in five small businesses does not have a Web site, and many of those that do have 
sites that lack the ability to make sales online. To online shoppers, especially, these businesses 
might as well be invisible because doing business online and offline are inextricably connected. 
Today’s shoppers prefer to purchase from companies that offer a multichannel approach, particu-
larly those that offer in-store pick-up for online orders and in-store returns for online purchases.48
A multichannel approach pays big dividends even for small businesses that consider themselves 
completely “local.” One recent survey reports that 91 percent of shoppers have gone into a store 
as a result of an online encounter with a business.49 When looking to purchase products locally, 
85 percent shoppers go online to conduct research first, looking for store hours, directions, maps, 
and special sales.50 Others prefer the convenience of making online purchases after having a 
positive encounter with a company’s physical location. In addition, customers routinely share 
their opinions online about products and their shopping experience with companies. These trends 
point to the need for businesses to use a multichannel approach to selling their products and ser-
vices that includes the Internet as one option. The key is to meet customers wherever they want 
r
to do business with a personalized shopping experience like the ones they encounter in the best 
brick-and-mortar stores. C. Wonder, a retailer of women’s clothing and accessories and home 
décor, is working hard to build brand recognition and loyalty with customers by surprising and 
delighting its best online customers with special gifts and handwritten thank-you notes in pack-
ages. The young company also relies on social media such as Facebook and Twitter to establish 
connections and to build a sense of community with its customers. For example, if a customer 
likes a particular purse on Facebook and later logs into the C. Wonder Web site with her Facebook 
credentials, the site will display that purse on the home page. The company’s Web site also can
identify individual customers and, based on their past purchase history, customize the landing
pages they encounter to suit their tastes and preferences. “Personalized brand experiences for 
Web sites, apps, and passbook/wallet concepts using location and customer history and prefer-
ences wrapped in insight allow your brand to be more relevant and appealing to the customer,” 
says one e-commerce expert. “Those brands that stand out will win the loyalty battle.”51
Succumbing to this myth often leads entrepreneurs to make a fundamental mistake once they
finally decide to go online: They believe they have to have a “perfect” site before they can launch 
it. Few businesses get their sites “right” the first time. In fact, the most successful e-commerce
sites are works in progress; entrepreneurs are constantly changing them, removing what does not 
work and experimenting with new features to see what does work. Successful Web sites are much 
like a well-designed flower garden, constantly growing and improving, yet changing to reflect 
the climate of each season. Their creators worry less about creating the perfect site at the outset 
than about getting a site online and then using Web analytics to fix it, tweak it, and update it to
meet changing customer demands.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Strategies for E-Success
People now spend more time online than ever before. Today, the average American spends more 
time with digital media than he or she does watching television.52 However, converting these 
digital users into online customers requires a business to do more than merely set up a Web site
and wait for the hits to start rolling up. Building sufficient volume for a site takes energy, time, 
money, creativity, and, perhaps most important, a well-defined strategy.
Although the Web is a unique medium for creating a company, launching an e-business 
is not much different from launching a traditional offline company. The basic drivers of a suc-
cessful business are the same on the Internet as on Main Street. To be successful, both offline
and online companies require a sound business model and a well-formulated strategy that em-
phasizes customer service. The goals of e-commerce are no different from traditional offline
businesses—to increase sales, improve efficiency, and boost profits by serving customers better.
How a company integrates the Internet into its overall business strategy determines how success-
ful it will be. Following are some guidelines for building a successful e-commerce strategy for 
a small company.
FOCUS ON A NICHE IN THE MARKET Rather than try to compete head-to-head with the dominant 
players on the Web who have the resources and the brand recognition to squash smaller com-
petitors, many entrepreneurs find success serving market niches. Smaller companies’ limited 
resources usually are better spent focusing on niche markets than trying to be everything to 
everyone (recall the discussion of the focus strategy in Chapter 5). The idea is to concentrate on 
serving a small corner of the market that the giants have overlooked. Niches exist in every industry 
and can be highly profitable given the right strategy for serving them. A niche can be defined in
many ways, including by geography, customer profile, product, product usage, and many others.
Because of its pervasive reach and ability to tap large numbers of customers with a common 
interest, the Web provides an ideal mechanism for implementing a focus strategy.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Paul Geller: Thankster Entrepreneur Paul Geller spotted 
a niche from the past created by the burgeoning world of electronic communication: hand-
written thank-you notes. In 2011, Geller launched Thankster, a Web site that allows users to pur-
chase “handwritten” thank-you notes created with proprietary technology that duplicates 
customers’ actual handwriting and is indistinguishable from the real thing. A customer submits a 
scanned writing sample, which Thankster turns into a personalized font that the customer uses to
“write” thank-you notes that appear to be truly handwritten. Individuals use Thankster to send 
thank-you notes for weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, graduations, baby showers, and other special 
events. Businesses use the service to send notes to valued customers, clients, and employees. “Our 
digital lifestyles give us an easy way to shoot a quick thank you, but it’s one without perma-
nence,” says Geller. “Thankster offers people the best way to send a heartfelt, tangible thank you 
in the easiest, simplest way. You don’t even need to worry about buying stamps; we have that
covered.”53 ■
DEVELOP A COMMUNITY On the Web, competitors are just a mouse click away. To attract 
customers and keep them coming back, companies have discovered the need to offer more than 
just quality products and excellent customer service. Many seek to develop a community of 
customers with similar interests, the nucleus of which is their Web site. Others include features 
on their Web sites that allow visitors to share content easily with the people in their social
networks. These entrepreneurs intentionally build a social component into their Web sites, with
the goal of increasing customers’ loyalty by giving them the ability to interact with other like-
minded visitors or with experts to discuss and learn more about topics about which they are 
passionate. A company’s social media outlets are natural avenues for small companies to engage 
their customers because they give visitors the opportunity to have conversations about products, 
services, and topics that interest them (“What is your favorite sports drink?”). Adding social 
login options to a Web site allows customers to make purchases from their social media accounts
without having to create user profiles. Small businesses that are most successful at building a
community enlist their most passionate customers as company evangelists through social media
outlets such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and YouTube. Companies that

successfully create a community around their Web sites turn their customers into loyal fans who 
keep coming back and, better yet, invite others to join them. “Brands build loyalty by developing 
meaningful and memorable relationships with their customers,” says Alex Gonzalez, founder of 
Chatalog, a social shopping site.54
Ideally, a company’s Web site provides a mechanism not only for the company to connect 
with its customers but also for customers to engage one another. The most successful companies 
are those that seamlessly blend their Web sites with their social media presence and use one 
to support the other. Engaging customers through social media helps companies build a loyal 
following of fans who are passionate about its products or services and share news about the
company with their friends. A recent survey by Burstmedia reports that 49 percent of active adult 
social networkers follow at least one brand on social media.55 Internet users frequent sites of 
companies that embrace the social aspects of the Internet and give them the opportunity to inter-
act as part of a community with other customers and with company employees.

Palmisciano: Ranger Up Military veterans Tom Amenta and
Nick Palmisciano founded Ranger Up, an e-commerce company based in 
Durham, North Carolina, that sells military-themed apparel, signs, and 
gear. They use social media to engage customers and drive sales. Ranger 
Up hosts a YouTube channel that features military workout videos and a 
hit cartoon called “The Damn Few”; the channel has nearly 15,000 sub-
scribers and more than 4 million views. The company’s blog, Rhino Den,
draws 2.5 million views annually and features a Hero of the Week profile
and Warrior Poetry, poems written by soldiers and veterans. Ranger Up
also interacts with customers on Facebook, where its fan base is more 
than 200,000 strong. The company often asks its Facebook fans for input 
on new T-shirt designs and product ideas. “In 2011, 20 percent of our
marketing budget went to social media,” says Palmisciano. “In 2014, 
90 percent will.”56 ■
LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND ACT ON WHAT YOU HEAR On social 
media, customers often talk about the brands they buy and businesses
with which they interact. Successful companies make a concerted effort to listen to what their 
customers are saying about them on social media and respond to the feedback. Because of 
social media, customer comments, both positive and negative, play a more important role in a 
company’s reputation than ever before. Some negative comments are inevitable, and the worst 
thing a company can do is ignore them because customers do not. In fact, according to a recent 
survey by BrightLocal, a search engine optimization company, 85 percent of customers say they 
read online reviews to determine local businesses’ reputations. Smart entrepreneurs take the time 
to tune in to social media to hear what customers are saying about their businesses so that they
can resolve their customers’ problems and improve their companies’ reputations. Managers at 
the Land of Nod, an upscale children’s furniture store, monitor customer reviews and ratings of 
its products. Recently, employees analyzed the reviews of a popular activity table that 90 percent 
of customers said they would recommend to a friend and discovered several negative comments 
about the table’s surface getting scratched easily. Managers worked with the table’s manufacturer 
to redesign the table so that its surface is more durable and then contacted the customers who 
had reviewed the table and offered them new tables at no cost, transforming those customers into 
advocates for the Land of Nod brand.57
ATTRACT VISITORS BY GIVING AWAY “FREEBIES” One of the most important words on the 
Internet is “free.” Many successful e-merchants have discovered the ability to attract visitors to 
their sites by giving away something free and then selling them something else. One e-commerce 
consultant calls this cycle of giving something away and then selling something “the rhythm 
of the Web.”58 The “freebie” must be something customers value, but it does not have to be 
t
expensive, nor does it have to be a product. In fact, one of the most common giveaways on the
Web is information. (After all, that’s what most people on the Web are after!) Creating a free
online or e-mail newsletter with links to your company’s site, of course, and to others of interest

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
is one of the most effective ways of driving potential customers to a site. Meaningful content 
presented in a clear, professional fashion is a must. Experts advise keeping online newsletters
short—no more than about 600 words.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Craig and Tiffany Adamowski: 99 Bottles In 2009, 
Craig Adamowski, a former delivery driver for a beer and wine distributor, and his wife, 
Tiffany, opened 99 Bottles, a retail store in Federal Way, Washington, that sells more than 
1,200 brands of beer, ranging from local beers and American microbrews to meads (an ancient
brew made from honey) and imported brands from 43 countries. “It’s important for a small busi-
ness like ours to use social media to get to know our customers, to share what’s new, to educate
about beer, and to point them toward shared interests,” says Tiffany. “Facebook, Twitter, and our 
not-so-weekly newsletter, The Weekly Brews, are how we do this.” Many customers eagerly antici-
pate the e-mail arrival of The Weekly Brews, which is packed with useful and interesting informa-
tion for beer drinkers, news about upcoming special in-store events, and, of course, promotions 
about the unique beers 99 Bottle sells. “Many customers treat our newsletter as a shopping list,”
she explains. “They come in with highlights and notes looking for specific products. A good news-
letter promotes your social [media] outlets, links to relevant Web sites, and provides timely infor-
mation on products and services for your customers.” The newsletter, which has an impressive 
open rate of 30.1 percent, now goes to nearly 3,400 99 Bottles customers.59 ■
SELL THE “EXPERIENCE” When shoppers enter a retail store, they are courted by an attractive 
layout, appealing décor, and eye-catching merchandise displays and perhaps are greeted by a 
salesperson who can offer them information and advice about its products and services. Although 
e-commerce businesses lack this ability to have face-to-face contact with customers, they can
still engender loyalty by creating an engaging and enjoyable online shopping experience. Sites 
that offer shoppers easy navigation, a simple and fast checkout process, and thorough product 
descriptions with quality images can provide the same positive shopping experience that the best 
retail stores do.
MAKE CREATIVE USE OF E-MAIL BUT AVOID BECOMING A “SPAMMER” E-mail is still the backbone 
of online marketing, especially for small businesses. Numerous studies show that e-mail is the
most common marketing tool among small businesses. Used properly and creatively, e-mail can 
be an effective, low-cost way to build traffic on a Web site. The average open rate (the percentage
of recipients who open an e-mail) is 26.5 percent, the average click-through rate (the percentage 
of recipients who open an e-mail and click on the link to the company’s Web site) for e-mail 
marketing is 4.6 percent, and the average conversion rate (the percentage of recipients who 
actually make a purchase) for e-mails is 3.34 percent, which is higher than the average conversion 
rate of 2.55 percent for Web sites as a whole.60 One recent survey reports that marketers rank 
e-mail second only to search engine optimization as producing the highest return on investment 
of their marketing methods, outpacing paid search, social media, affiliate marketing, and mobile 
marketing.61
Just as with newsletters, an e-mail’s content should offer something of value to recipients. 
Customers welcome well-constructed permission e-mail that directs them to a company’s 
site for information or special deals. Unfortunately, spam, those unsolicited and universally 
despised e-mail messages (which rank below postal “junk mail” and telemarketing calls as 
the worst form of junk advertising), limits the effectiveness of companies’ e-mail legitimate 
marketing efforts. Spam is a persistent problem for online marketers; Internet security firm 
Trustwave reports that 75 percent of e-mails sent are spam (and nearly 7 percent of e-mails 
contain links to malicious Web sites).62 Companies must comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, a
law passed in 2003 that regulates commercial e-mail and sets standards for commercial e-mail
messages. (The penalties can be as much as $16,000 per e-mail for companies that violate 
the law.)
To avoid having their marketing messages become part of that electronic clutter, companies 
rely on permission e-mails, collecting customers’ and visitors’ e-mail addresses (and their per-
mission to send them e-mail messages) when they register on a site to receive a freebie. The most 
successful online retailers post e-mail opt-in messages prominently throughout their Web sites
and on their social media pages as well. When customers sign up to receive permission e-mails, a

company should send them “welcome” e-mails immediately. The most successful marketers give
new customers a reason to open welcome e-mails, such as including an offer to “enjoy 10 percent 
off your first order.” To be successful at collecting a sufficient number of e-mail addresses, a com-
pany must make clear to customers that they will receive messages that are meaningful to them 
and that the company will not sell e-mail addresses to others (which should be part of its posted 
privacy policy). Once a business has a customer’s permission to send information in additional 
e-mail messages, it has a meaningful marketing opportunity to create a long-term customer rela-
tionship and to build customer loyalty.
Just as with a newsletter, an e-mail’s content should offer something of value to recipients, 
which means that creating the right subject line is essential to success. A study of the subject 
lines of more than 2 billion marketing e-mails by Adestra shows that words such as “new,” “free 
delivery,” “sale,” “video,” “alert,” “win,” and “daily” produce above average open rates. In con-
trast, words such as “webinar,” “register,” “report,” “offer,” “only,” “gift,” and “save” result in be-
low average open rates.63 Getting to the point in the subject line also helps; a study by MailChimp 
shows that subject lines with fewer than 40 characters (28 to 39 characters is the “sweet spot”)
yield the highest open and click-through rates.64 Customers welcome well-constructed permis-
sion e-mail that directs them to a company’s site for information or special deals without resort-
ing to a “hard sell.” The experts at MailChimp say, “When it comes to e-mail marketing, the best 
subject lines tell what’s inside, and the worst subject lines
l
sell what’s inside.”

MAKE SURE YOUR WEB SITE SAYS “CREDIBILITY” Online shoppers are wary, and with the 
prevalence of online fraud, they have every right to be. Unless a company can build visitors’ trust 
in its Web site, selling to them is virtually impossible. Visitors begin to evaluate the credibility of 
a site as soon as they arrive. Studies show that shoppers form an impression of a site’s credibility
within just 50 milliseconds (about the same amount of time required for a hummingbird to flap 
its wings five times) of arrival.66 Although quality content is crucial for converting visitors into 
paying customers, visitors’ initial impressions of a site are almost wholly design related, which 
means that entrepreneurs must create sites that are simple, consistent, appealing, and easy to 
navigate. Does the site look professional? Are there misspelled words and typographical errors? If 
the site provides information, does it note the sources of that information? If so, are those sources 
legitimate? Are they trustworthy? Is the presentation of the information fair and objective, or is
it biased? Are there dead links on the site? Does the company have its privacy and merchandise 
return policies posted in a prominent place?
One of the simplest ways to establish credibility with customers is to use brand names they
know and trust. Whether a company sells nationally recognized brands or its own well-known 
private brand, using those names on its site creates a sense of legitimacy. People buy brand names 
they trust, and online companies can use that to their advantage. Businesses selling lesser-known 
brands should use customer testimonials and endorsements (with their permission, of course) 
about a product or service.
An effective way to build customer confidence is by joining an online seal program such
as McAfee, TrustWave, TRUSTe, Norton, BBBOnline, or others. The online equivalent of the 
Underwriter Laboratories stamp or the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, these seals mean 
that a company meets certain standards concerning the privacy of customers’ information and
the resolution of customer complaints. Posting a privacy policy (more on this later in this 
chapter) is another key ingredient in building trust. Including customer reviews, which Internet 
users say they believe more than product descriptions from a business, on product Web pages 
increases customer loyalty and trust in an online business. Testimonials, either in writing or 
on video, from real customers enhance a company’s online credibility, especially among first-
time customers. Businesses that are the subject of media coverage should include a “media” or 
“featured in” page with links to articles or videos about the company so that they can magnify 
the benefits of publicity. Links to the company’s social media accounts using “follow” buttons 
lend credibility to an online business. Providing a street address, an e-mail address, and a toll-
free telephone number also sends a subtle message to shoppers that a legitimate business is 
behind a Web site.
Another effective technique is to include an “about us” page on the Web site so that custom-
ers can read about the company’s “story”—its founders, a short summary of how they started 

358

the business, the challenges they have overcome, and other details. Customers enjoy support-
ing small businesses with which they feel a connection, and this is a perfect opportunity for 
a small company to establish that connection. Many small companies include photographs of 
their brick-and-mortar stores and of their employees to combat the Web’s anonymity and to give 
shoppers the feeling that they are supporting a friendly small business. One small online retailer 
includes on his Web site short anecdotes about his dog, Cody, the official company mascot and
Cody’s “views” on featured products. The response to the technique has been so strong that Cody
has become a celebrity among the company’s customers and even has her own e-mail account. 
Table 9.1 offers 12 guidelines for building the credibility of a Web site.
MAKE THE MOST OF THE WEB’S GLOBAL REACH Despite the Web’s reputation as an international
marketplace, many entrepreneurs fail to utilize fully its global reach. More than 2.4 billion people 
around the world use the Internet, and nearly 89 percent of them live outside North America.67
In addition, more than 73 percent of Web users throughout the world speak a language other 
than English.68 Limiting a global market to only a small portion of its potential by ignoring 
foreign customers makes little sense. E-companies wanting to draw significant sales from foreign 
markets must design their sites with their foreign customers in mind. Global shoppers are much 
more likely to purchase from sites that are written in their own languages. The most common
languages that U.S.-based e-commerce companies translate their content into are French, 
Spanish, German, Chinese, and Japanese.69 A common strategy is to include several “language 
buttons” on the opening page of a site that take customers to pages in the language of their choice. 
However, experienced e-commerce companies have learned that offering a localized page for 
every country or region they target pays off in increased sales. Doing so allows entrepreneurs
to adapt the terminology they use on their sites and in their search engines to local dialects. For 
instance, an e-commerce company based in the United States might think it is selling diapers, but 
its customers in Australia and the United Kingdom are looking for “nappies.”
Virtual companies trying to establish a foothold in foreign markets by setting up Web sites 
dedicated to them run the same risk that actual companies do: offending international visitors
by using the business conventions and standards the companies are accustomed to using in the
United States. Business practices, even those used online, that are acceptable, even expected, in 
the United States may be taboo in other countries. Color schemes can be important, too. Selecting 
the “wrong” colors and symbols on a site targeting people in a particular country can hurt sales 
and offend visitors. A little research into the subtleties of a target country’s culture and business
practices can save a great deal of embarrassment and money. Creating secure, simple, and reli-
able payment methods for foreign customers also will boost sales. International delivery services 
offer software that small companies can incorporate into their Web sites that calculate the final
“landed cost” (including relevant tariffs and duties) of orders and estimate delivery dates.
When translating the content of their Web sites into other languages, entrepreneurs must 
use extreme caution. This is not the time to pull out their notes from an introductory Spanish
t
course and begin their own translations. Hiring professional translation and localization services 
to convert a company’s Web content into other languages minimizes the likelihood of a company
unintentionally offending foreign customers.
GO MOBILE The typical online shopper has expanded his or her reach across multiple screens 
(and screen sizes). Research by Jumptap and comScore shows that 51 percent of the time 
spent on the Internet is through a mobile device (12 percent on tablets and 39 percent on smart 
phones).70 More than 64 percent of mobile phone users own smart phones, and 35 percent of 
Americans 16 and older own tablets.71 According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project,
21 percent of mobile phone owners’ primary use of their phones is to access the Internet. These 
mobile users continue to increase the frequency with which they make online purchases from 
their devices (m-commerce). In fact, the average amount per order for smart phones ($97.82) 
and tablets ($96.84) is larger than the average amount per order for desktop computers ($91.76).
However, conversion rates for mobile devices (1.01 percent for smart phones and 3.12 percent 
for tablets) are lower than those for desktop computers (3.28 percent).72 Despite the rapid growth 
of m-commerce (see Figure 9.5), only 34 percent of small businesses have developed Web sites 
that are optimized for smart phones.73 Companies that fail to develop Web sites that display

TABLE 9.1 Twelve Guidelines for Building the Credibility of a Web Site
Guideline
Tips
1. Allow visitors to verify easily the 
accuracy of the information on 
your site.
Include references, which you should cite, from credible third parties to support the 
information you present on your site.
2. Show that there are real people 
behind your site.
List a physical address for your business and post photographs of your store or office 
or the people who work there. Photos allow shoppers to put faces with the names of 
the people with whom they are dealing.
3. Emphasize the skills, experience, 
and knowledge of the people in 
your company.
Tell visitors about the experts you have on your team, their credentials, and their 
accomplishments. Is your company or your employees associated with a well-known, 
respected national organization? If so, mention it and provide a link to its Web site.
4. Show that honest, trustworthy people 
stand behind your site.
In addition to posting photographs of the owner and employees, include brief 
biographical sketches that might include “fun” facts about each person, their hobbies, 
and links to blogs they create. Erik Leamon, owner of The Ride, a full-service bicycle 
store in Conway, Arkansas, markets the charm of his business on The Ride’s Web site, 
which profiles the company’s five employees, including Pokey, the shop dog, who
serves as the shop’s unofficial customer service representative.
5. Make it easy for customers to 
contact you.
One of the simplest ways to enhance your site’s credibility is to include contact 
information in a highly visible location. Be sure to include a physical address, a telephone 
number, and e-mail addresses. Always respond promptly to customer communications.
6. Make sure your site has a 
professional look.
Online shoppers evaluate the quality of a Web site by its appearance within the first 
few seconds of arriving. Pay careful attention to layout, navigation, search tools, 
images, grammar, spelling, and other seemingly “minor” details because they do make 
a difference. A professional site does not have to look “corporate” to be professional, 
however. It should reflect your company’s unique personality.
7. Make your site easy to use—and 
useful.
Sites that are easy for customers to use and that are useful to them score high on 
credibility. Resist the temptation to dazzle visitors with all of the coolest features; 
instead, focus on keeping your site simple and user friendly. Visitors perceive sites that 
combine useful information with a purchasing opportunity as more credible than those 
that merely try to sell them something.
8. Update your site regularly.
Visitors rate sites that show they have been updated or reviewed recently higher than
those that contain outdated or obsolete information.
9. Prominently display your company’s 
privacy policy.
Visitors perceive sites that display a meaningful privacy policy—and follow it—as
more credible than those that do not.
10. Be vigilant for errors of all types, 
no matter how insignificant they 
may seem.
Typographical errors, misspellings, grammatical mistakes, broken links, and other 
problems cause a site to lose credibility in customers’ eyes. Details matter!
11. Post the seals of approval your 
company has won.
Seals of approval from third parties such as the Better Business Bureau, TRUSTe,
WebTrust, and others give shoppers confidence that an online company is reputable and
trustworthy.
12. Make sure customers know their 
online transactions are secure.
To conduct business effectively online, companies must ensure that customers’ credit 
card transactions are secure. Online retailers typically use Secure Sockets Layer 
technology that is verified as secure by a third party such as VeriSign. Be sure to post 
the secure seal prominently on your Web site.

navigate a site and find the items they want to purchase. Conversely, 67 percent of mobile users 
say that when they visit a mobile-friendly site, they are more likely to make a purchase from 
the company.76 By investing a little more time and money to create responsive Web sites, those
that conform naturally and seamlessly to the size and resolution of the screen on which they are
displayed, small companies can accommodate customers on any device from which they want to 
shop. A responsive Web design takes a “one size fits all” approach and eliminates the necessity 
of creating multiple versions of a Web site for various platforms and moves a company’s Web site 
higher in Google’s all-important search engine rankings. Experts say a common mistake many 
businesses make is assuming that they must present the same Web content on all screens. Smart 
entrepreneurs design their responsive sites to simplify the content that appears on mobile users’ 
screens and making navigation and “add to cart” buttons easier to see and touch.
Consumers’ pervasive use of mobile devices, social media, and search engines has led busi-
nesses to develop integrated social-local-mobile (SoLoMo) strategies. Shoppers use these three
tools to enhance their shopping experiences, and smart entrepreneurs can use that tendency to 
their advantage with an appropriate SoLoMo strategy. Eighty percent of smart phone users access 
social media sites (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are most popular) with their devices, and 
94 percent use their devices to search for information on local businesses. After searching for a 
local business, 70 percent of users call the business and 66 percent of them visit the store. Half of 
all smart phone owners also use their phones to assist them while they are shopping in stores.77
What can small companies do to capitalize on the SoLoMo trend? One of the most impor-
tant steps a company can take is to create a responsive Web site that is optimized for mobile de-
vices. Entrepreneurs also should design their sites for achieve high rankings in local searches. For 
instance, a jeweler in Birmingham, Alabama, would include location-related terms in the titles,

tags, and text of its Web pages and in the key words on which it bids (e.g., Birmingham jewelry, 
Birmingham diamonds, Birmingham necklaces, and others). Mobile sites also should automatically 
display the store’s address, operating hours, and telephone number (with a click-to-call button) and 
include a prominent map. Some business owners also offer location-based special offers or dis-
counts to encourage customers to visit the store. Businesses can create listings on Yelp, FourSquare,
Google+Local, and other sites to encourage mobile users to locate nearby businesses and “check 
in” when they arrive. Once inside a store, customers expect free Wi-Fi, which allows local stores to 
offer apps that allow shoppers to view product features, prices, and customer reviews, all of which 
can help close a sale. When designing mobile Web sites, companies also must be aware that speed 
is important (although mobile customers are somewhat more forgiving than those who use desktop 
PCs). Half of mobile customers say they abandon sites that require more than 10 seconds to load.78
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Deb Shops Deb Shops, a fashion retailer whose product 
line is aimed at teenage girls, recently updated the way in which its Web site appears on
shoppers’ mobile devices, particularly smart phones. The company added a “What’s Hot” button 
to its mobile commerce site that displays all of the apparel that currently is trending on Facebook, 
Pinterest, and Instagram and allows shoppers to find the latest fashions with one tap. With more 
than 30,000 products, enabling customers using mobile devices to get to the products they
are most interested in is essential. Shoppers who tap the “What’s Hot” button are 20 percent 
more likely to make a purchase and generate 170 percent more revenue than those who do not.
In the site update, Deb Shops also added a “More Like This” button that displays for customers 
other products that are similar to the ones they are viewing. The percentage of traffic that arrives 
at the company’s Web site from smart phones has grown steadily, from 15 percent to more than 
50 percent in just two years.79 ■
PROMOTE YOUR WEB SITE ONLINE AND OFFLINE E-commerce entrepreneurs must use every
means available—both online and offline—to promote their Web sites and to drive traffic to
them. In addition to using traditional online techniques, such as registering with search engines, 
using pay-per-click techniques, and creating blogs, Web entrepreneurs must promote their sites 
offline as well. Ads in other media, such as direct mail or newspapers, that mention a site’s URL 
will bring customers to it. It is also a good idea to put the company’s Web address on everything
a company publishes, from its advertisements and letterhead to shopping bags, business cards, 
and even employees’ uniforms! The techniques for generating publicity for an offline business 
described in Chapter 8 can be just as effective for online businesses needing to make their domain 
names better known without breaking their budgets. A passive approach to generating Web site
traffic is a recipe for failure; entrepreneurs who are as innovative at promoting their e-businesses
as they are at creating them can attract impressive numbers of visitors to their sites.
USE SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS The social aspects of the 
Internet that are evident in sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube have become
key components of companies’ e-commerce efforts. Social media marketing techniques recognize
that shoppers, especially young ones, expect to take a proactive role in their shopping experience 
by writing (and reading) product reviews, asking questions, reading and writing blogs, watching 
and creating videos, posting comments, and engaging in other interactive behavior. According 
to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 73 percent of online adults participate in social
networks, a significant increase from just 8 percent in 2005. The highest level of participation
in social media is among adults under 30.80 In addition, 78 percent of adult Internet users 
watch online videos (comedy and how-to videos are most popular), 32 percent read blogs, and 
32 percent post online reviews of products and services. Shoppers perceive online reviews and 
blogs as credible, and they influence buying behavior. 81 According to one study, 52 percent of 
consumers say blogs have influenced their purchasing decisions.82
Small businesses are responding to the opportunity to connect with their customers online by
adding the following social components to their e-commerce strategies:
● Mashups. A mashup is a Web site or an application that combines content from multiple 
sources into a single Web service. For example, Twitzu is a mashup that allows users to manage 
invitations and responses to events. They invite their Twitter followers to an event—the grand 
opening of a new location, for example—and then receive responses from guests on Twitter.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Mobile commerce is the hottest trend in e-commerce. Increasingly, 
shoppers are accessing companies’ Web sites from mobile devices 
such as smart phones and tablets, and entrepreneurs must take
this trend into account when designing their companies’ Web
sites. Shoppers who encounter a Web site designed for a tradi-
tional desktop computer on a mobile device will move on to a
competitors’ site almost immediately rather than attempt to ne-
gotiate the garbled mess that appears on their mobile screens. 
Unfortunately, only 34 percent of small business Web sites are op-
timized for mobile commerce. Thanks to responsive Web design, 
the challenge of creating a mobile-friendly Web site is relatively 
easy to manage. A responsive Web site is one that conforms natu-
rally and seamlessly to the size and resolution of the screen on 
which it is displayed. In other words, the site’s content adapts to 
fit the screen size and features of the device on which the shopper 
is using. Skinny Ties, a family-owned business that sells its name-
sake product online, recently switched from desktop-oriented 
Web site to a responsive Web site, which required company own-
ers to reconsider the site’s content, features, and functions. “It 
meant throwing out things that weren’t really useful,” says Bren-
dan Falkowski, the company’s e-commerce consultant. Managers 
used a “mobile-first” philosophy as part of their responsive Web 
design. “Instead of planning the look of the site on a big screen, 
where you have a lot of space to move things around, we looked
at content on the small screen first, where you don’t have that
freedom.” After Skinny Ties switched to its mobile-first respon-
sive Web design, the company saw sales increase 42.4 percent, 
its conversion rate increase by 13.6 percent, and its bounce rate 
decline 23.2 percent. Sales from mobile devices also increased by 
an impressive 211 percent.
By using the following principles, a small business can create
an effective mobile Web site with an above-average conversion 
rate and a below-average bounce rate.
•
Simplicity reigns. When designing a responsive Web site, 
entrepreneurs must remember that mobile shoppers are 
viewing their companies’ sites on the smaller screens of 
their mobile devices—often just 3 or 4 inches on a smart 
phone and 10 inches on a tablet. “You’ve got to rethink 
your entire page layout for mobile because of the tiny 
screens,” says David Gould, CEO of mShopper, a company 
that provides mobile commerce platforms. Therefore, simple 
sites that are well designed and intuitive and allow users 
to find what they are looking for quickly are most effec-
tive. “The context also is a challenge; you’re trying to reach 
a user who is on the go and whose needs are different.” 
Eliminate superfluous content and large graphics, and cre-
ate tabs users can tap to access more detailed information. 
Fast download times translate into higher conversion rates, 
especially on mobile devices.
•
Create a clean layout and easy navigation. On small 
screens, every square millimeter is important, and a com-
pany’s site must make the most of every one. Clean, 
easy-to-follow layouts and simple navigation are essential 
for m-commerce success, especially on the home page. 
Avoid using too many levels of subpages and be sure to
give customers an easy way back to the home page from
any page in the site. Larger fonts actually work better on 
small screens. Action buttons (e.g., “Click to add to cart”) 
and links should be large enough for users to tap easily with 
their fingers.
•
Make sure your company’s unique selling proposition 
(USP) is the focal point of the site. As you learned in 
Chapter 8, a company’s unique selling proposition explains 
in just a few words why customers should buy from your 
business rather than the competition. Toolfetch, an online 
retailer of tools and construction equipment with an 
inventory of more than 300,000 products, displays its USP 
clearly for all shoppers: “Search faster. Done faster.” The 
company also uses a clever tag line its customers can relate 
to around its search engine box: “Hand me that _____ 
will ya?”
•
Develop your site’s content with your target cus-
tomer in mind. As you design your site, think about the
needs users are trying to satisfy by visiting it from a mobile 
device and then focus its content on meeting those needs.
Are they trying to find a fast, convenient place to eat 
lunch, or are they looking for help in selecting the right
cordless drill?
•
Include a call to action on every page. Every page on 
a company’s Web site should include an appropriate call 
to action. Do you want the customer to register for a 
newsletter or a Webinar? Download a white paper? Like 
your company on Facebook? Make a purchase? Making 
call-to-action buttons so large that they take up the entire
width of the screen increases the probability that visitors will 
take the desired action.
•
Go easy on text and incorporate photographs and 
videos. Expecting mobile users to read pages of text on tiny 
screens is fruitless; instead, rely on videos and photographs 
to capture their attention. Judicious use of videos also can 
draw customers into a site.
•
Use tabs, expandable content, and links to avoid 
scrolling. Scrolling down a Web site to reach desired 
content is more difficult for mobile users than for desktop 
computer users. Therefore, mobile sites should rely on tabs, 
expandable content, and links to give users access to more
detailed information. Outdoor retailer Orvis, for example, 
uses highly visible tabs shoppers can tap to reach more
product details, customer reviews, and size charts for its 
products.
•
Minimize the number of steps in the checkout process.

rate. At Toolfetch, 15 percent of Web site traffic comes from 
smart phones and 20 percent comes from tablets, which 
led the company to create a one-step checkout process 
rather than the three to four steps that many companies use 
on their mobile sites. “We found that a higher percentage 
of customers would abandon the checkout process with 
an extra step or two,” says Andrew Brown, cofounder and 
CEO of Toolfetch. “We kept the mobile site very light on 
its feet.”

● Really Simple Syndication. Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is an application that 
allows subscribers to aggregate content from their favorite Web sites into a single feed that 
is delivered automatically whenever the content is updated. RSS is ideal for companies 
whose customers are information junkies. “[RSS] is a must-have for any company Web 
site or blog because it allows people to track current news via their RSS feeds,” says Louis 
Columbus, an expert on using social media.83
● Social networking. Many small businesses drive traffic to their Web sites through their 
Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram pages; Twitter posts; and LinkedIn accounts. They use 
their Web sites as a “hub” supported by the “spokes” of social media. Web sites that in-
clude a social sign-in feature, which allows social media users to bypass creating accounts 
and passwords when they log into a company’s Web site, create a seamless integration be-
tween a company’s Web site and social media. Many small businesses have discovered that 
social media provide an excellent platform for engaging and interacting with their custom-
ers and listening to what their customers are saying about their businesses, products, and 
services. “It is essential that all employees become the eyes and ears of an organization on 
social media,” says entrepreneur Bryan Holmes, founder of HootSuite Media in Vancouver, 
British Columbia.84
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Peter and Morton’s Steakhouse After a long day
of business meetings in Florida, Peter Shankman, CEO of Geek Factory, was about to 
board a flight back to Newark Airport (EWR) when he jokingly sent a tweet to his favorite 
restaurant, Morton’s Steakhouse, that said “Hey @Mortons – can you meet me at the
Newark Airport with a porterhouse when I land in two hours? Thanks.” Employees at the
Morton’s Steakhouse saw the tweet and contacted the manager at the Hackensack, New Jersey,
location, which is 23 miles from Newark Airport. When Shankman stepped into the airport 
terminal, he saw a waiter from Morton’s dressed in a tuxedo holding a takeout bag that 
contained a 24-ounce porterhouse steak, an order of colossal shrimp, a side of potatoes, 
Morton’s signature bread, two napkins, and silverware. “Oh. My. God. I don’t believe it.
Morton’s showed up at EWR WITH A PORTERHOUSE!” read Shankman’s next tweet, which
went to more than 100,000 followers. He also blogged about the incident, creating even
more goodwill for the Morton’s Steakhouse chain. Soon, Twitter and other social media 
were filled with posts from customers around the country saying they had just enjoyed won-
derful meals at Morton’s.85 ■
Businesses also have discovered that encouraging customers to post their favorite products 
to their Facebook pages or sending tweets about them increases sales.
● Wikis. A wiki is a dynamic collection of Web pages that allows users to add to or edit 
their content. The most popular wiki is Wikipedia, the user-created online encyclopedia for 
which users provide the content. Some companies use wikis to encourage customers to par-
ticipate in the design of their products, a process called cocreation.
● Widgets. Another tool small companies use to attract attention on the Web is widgets (also 
known as gadgets), low-cost applications that appear like small television screens on Web

sites, blogs, or computer desktops and perform specific functions. Entrepreneurs can create 
their own widgets or purchase them from developers and customize them, adding their 
own names, brands, and logos. Customers and visitors can download the widget to their 
desktops or, perhaps, post it to their own blogs or social media pages, where other Web us-
ers see it and the social nature of the Web exposes the company to thousands of potential
customers. A popular widget not only drives customers to a site but also can improve a
company’s ranking on major search engines.
● Apps. Like widgets, apps provide a simple way for businesses to stay in their customers’ 
minds and to generate sales. Sebastian’s Café, a five-unit chain of salad and sandwich 
shops in Boston, uses a loyalty program app that keeps customers engaged. Depending 
on how much they spend at Sebastian’s Café, customers earn points and the opportunity 
to move their status from “Fresh” to “Fresh-a-licious,” earning special deals, discounts, 
and complimentary meals along the way. The branded app tracks customers’ progress and 
notifies them of menu changes, upcoming events, and specials. Since launching the app,
owner Mike Conley says the chain’s customer visits have increased 30 percent and total
revenue has increased 17 percent.86
DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY Search engine optimization 
strategies have become an essential part of online companies’ marketing strategies. With 
nearly 700 million Web sites (and growing) in existence, it is no surprise that online shoppers’ 
first stop usually is a search engine; 89 percent of shoppers rely on search engines to help 
them find information about business, products, and services before they make purchases.87
As a result, entrepreneurs are devoting more of their marketing budgets to search engine 
optimization strategies that are focused on landing their Web sites at or near the top of the 
most popular search engines. For a company engaged in e-commerce, a well-defined search 
engine optimization strategy is a vital part of its overall marketing strategy. Search engines 
drive more traffic to e-commerce sites (33.1 percent) than either e-mail (3.3 percent) or social 
media (1.46 percent).88 A recent study by Custora reports that customers who find a company’s 
Web site through a search engine produce a higher lifetime value (54 percent above average)
than customers who arrive at a site as a result of e-mail marketing, affiliate ads, banner ads, or 
social media.89
One of the biggest challenges facing e-commerce entrepreneurs is maintaining the effec-
tiveness of their search engine marketing strategies. Because the most popular search engines 
are constantly updating and refining their algorithms—the secretive formulas and method-
ology search engines use to find and rank the results of Web searches—entrepreneurs also 
must evaluate and constantly refine their search strategies. After Google, the leading search 
engine with 67 percent market share, changed its algorithms recently, many businesses that 
had ranked highly in searches found that their listings fell sharply down the search engine 
results page.
A company’s Web search strategy must incorporate the two basic types of search engine 
results: natural or organic listings and paid or sponsored listings. Although shoppers more of-f
ten click on organic listings (60 percent vs. 40 percent for paid listings), paid listings generate 
higher net revenue per visit than organic listings.90 Natural (organic) listings arise as a result of 
“spiders,” powerful programs that search engines use to crawl around the Web and analyze sites 
for key words, links, and other data. Based on what they find, spiders use complex algorithms
to index Web sites so that a search engine can display a listing of relevant Web sites when a per-
son enters a key word in the engine to start a search. Some search engines use people-powered 
searches rather than spider-powered ones to assemble their indexes. With natural listings, an
entrepreneur’s goal is to get his or her Web site displayed at or near the top of the list of search 
results. Search engine optimization (SEO) involves managing the content, key words, titles, 
tags, features, and design of a Web site so that it appears at or near the top of Internet search
results. The reason that SEO is so important is that nearly 92 percent of search engine users click 
on a link to a site that appears on the first page of the search results (see Figure 9.6).91 “The dif-f
ference between being seen on page one and page two of search results can mean thousands, even

engine marketing company.92 A useful resource for entrepreneurs is SEO Book, a search engine 
optimization site (www.seobook.com) that offers both free tools and more than 100 training 
modules on a variety of SEO topics.
A fierce battle among online competitors rages for landing on the first page of search results. 
Companies can use the following tips to improve their search placement results:
● Conduct brainstorming sessions to develop a list of key words and phrases that searchers 
are likely to use when using a search engine to locate a company’s products and services
and then use those words and phrases on your Web pages. Usually, simple terms are better 
than industry jargon.
● Use Google’s AdWords Keyword Tool or Microsoft Bing Ads to determine how many 
monthly searches users conduct globally and locally for a key word or phrase. More 
specific, lower-volume key words and phrases usually produce higher search rankings 
because they provide potential customers the more focused results they are seeking.
● Use these key words in the title tags (metatags, which are limited to 140 characters) and 
headlines of your Web pages. Some search engines are geared to pick them up. For best 
results, you should focus each page of your site on one specific key word or phrase that 
should appear in the page’s title. Placing key words in these critical locations can be
tedious, but it produces better search results for the companies that take the time to do it.
● Create meaningful, relevant content for each Web page with your customers and their 
needs in mind. Each page should contain at least 1,000 to 2,000 words that are relevant to 
the key word used in the title tag. Entrepreneurs should avoid artificially “stuffing” content 
(and title tags) with key words because most search engines penalize sites that attempt 
this maneuver. The average Web page that appears on the first page in Google rankings 
contains more than 2,000 words.93 Organize the text into well-structured paragraphs using 
subheadings and bullets and include photographs and illustrations (that have file names 
that match the key word of that page) and videos. Content that answers typical questions
customers ask increases a site’s search ranking.
● Encourage social media shares. The more shares a site’s content gets on social media, the 
more relevant it is to search engines.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
● Create unique product descriptions rather than merely copy manufacturers’ descriptions 
because search engines penalize sites with duplicate content, identical content that appears 
on multiple Web sites.
● Visit competitors’ sites for key word ideas but avoid using the exact phrases. Simply right-
clicking on a competitor’s Web page and choosing “View Source” will display the key
words used in the metatags on the site.
● Consider using less obvious key words and brand names. For instance, rather than using 
simply “bicycles,” a small bicycle retailer should consider key words such as “racing
bikes” “road racing bike,” or “LeMond” to draw customers.
● Ask customers which words and phrases they use when searching for the products and 
services the company sells.
● Use data analytics tools to find the words and phrases (and the search engines) that brought 
visitors to the company’s Web site.
● Check blogs and bulletin boards related to the company’s products and services for poten-
tial key terms.
● Don’t forget about misspellings; people often misspell the words they type into search 
engines. Include them in your list.
● Hire services such as Wordtracker that monitor and analyze Web users’ search engine 
tendencies.
● Block irrelevant results with “negative key words,” those that are excluded in a search. 
Twenty percent of small businesses do not use any negative keywords in their Google
AdWords accounts.94
● Include links to other relevant Web sites and land links to your Web site on high-profile 
Web sites. Search engines rank sites that have external links to high-volume sites higher 
than those that do not.
● Start a blog. Well-written blogs not only draw potential customers to your site but also tend 
to attract links from other Web sites. Blogs also allow entrepreneurs to use key words stra-
tegically and frequently, moving their sites up in search result rankings.
● Post videos on your site. In addition to uploading them to video sites such as YouTube, 
companies can wait for organic listings to appear, or they can submit their videos to search 
engines for listing. Forrester Research estimates that a properly submitted video is 50 times 
more likely to achieve a first-page listing on Google than any text-based page.95
Because organic listings can take months to materialize, many e-commerce companies rely 
on paid listings, giving them an immediate presence in search engines. Paid (sponsored) listings
are short text advertisements with links to the sponsoring company’s Web site that appear on
the results pages of a search engine when a user types in a key word or phrase. Entrepreneurs 
use paid search listings to accomplish what natural listings cannot. Fortunately, just three search 
engines—Google, Microsoft Bing, and Yahoo!—account for 96 percent of the searches con-
ducted in the United States.96 Google, the most popular search engine with 67 percent of all
searches, displays paid listings as “sponsored links” at the top and down the side of each re-
sults page, and Yahoo! shows “sponsored results” at the top and the bottom of its results pages.
Advertisers bid on key words to determine their placement on a search engine’s results page. On
Google, an ad’s placement in search results is a function of the ad’s relevance (determined by a 
quality score of 1 to 10 that Google assigns) and the advertiser’s bid on the key word. The average 
quality score on Google currently is 5.97 The ad that gets the most prominent placement (at the 
top) of the search engine’s results page when a user types in that key word on the search engine 
is the one with the highest combination of quality score and bid price. An advertiser pays only
when a shopper clicks through to its Web site from the search engine. For this reason, paid list-
ings also are called pay-for-placement, pay-per-click, and pay-for-performance ads. The higher 
an ad’s quality score, the lower is its cost per click. Compared to an ad with an average quality 
paid (sponsored) 
listings

links to the sponsoring 
company’s Web site that

of a search engine when 
the user types in a key word 
or phrase.

score of 5, an ad with a quality score of just 1 produces a cost-per-click that is 400 percent higher. 
However, an ad with a perfect quality score of 10 has a cost-per-click that is 50 percent lower than 
one with an average quality score.98
The average cost per click on Google AdWords is 53 cents, up from 38 cents in 2005.99*
Although paid listings can be expensive, they allow advertisers to evaluate their effectiveness us-
ing the statistical reports the search engine generates. Pay-per-click advertisers can control costs 
by geotargeting their ads, having them appear only in certain areas, and by setting a spending 
limit per day.
Using generic terms results in large numbers of searches but often produces very small conver-
sion rates and very little in sales; normally, entrepreneurs get better results bidding on more precise, 
lower-volume (“long-tail”) key words. Rather than competing with much larger companies for 5 or 
10 common key words, a more effective strategy is to bid on 200 less popular, more specific key 
words that produce clicks from customers who are more likely to buy. The typical small business 
spends $1,200 per month on pay-per-click advertising and bids on 212 key words.100
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Matt Lauzon: Gemvara Jake Sharpless, marketing spe-
cialist at online jeweler Gemvara, a company founded by Babson College student Matt 
Lauzon, has had success focusing on less expensive, specific words and “long-tail” phrases because 
they are not as popular (or expensive) as more common terms. For instance, rather than bidding 
on the common term “jewelry,” Sharpless bids on specific words such as “necklaces,” “ruby neck-
laces,” or “fire opal wedding rings.” “By using long-tail terms, you’re going to match better with 
customers and pay less for the terms,” he says. Sharpless also bids on common misspellings of key 
words and blocks irrelevant results with negative key words.101 ■
Google’s product listing ads (PLAs) show more information, including product images, 
prices, business name, and a short promotional message, than do traditional text ads. PLAs appear 
in their own box separate from plain text ads in Google’s search results. Businesses set up PLAs
through either their AdWords account or through Google’s Merchant Center. One study shows
that PLAs offer higher click-through rates (21 percent) and lower cost-per-click (26 percent) 
than text ads.102 Online magazine Search Engine Watch (http://searchenginewatch.com/) provides 
many useful resources for entrepreneurs who seek to optimize their search engine strategies.
One problem facing companies that rely on paid listings and display ads to generate Web
traffic is click fraud, which occurs when a company pays for clicks that are generated by some-
one with no interest in or intent to purchase a product or service. “Botnets,” programs that hijack 
computers around the world to generate thousands of phony clicks on a Web site, are a common 
source of click fraud. Botnets also are the source of digital ad fraud, which occurs when they
generate phony traffic to Web sites on which businesses then pay for advertising space that no
one sees. Although the cost of click fraud is difficult to measure, one security company estimates 
that botnets drive 29 percent of global display ad traffic and cost companies up to $10 billion 
annually. A botnet known as ZeroAccess hijacked nearly 2 million computers around the world 
whose 1.9 billion phony clicks per day cost online companies $90,000 per day before officials 
could shut it down.103 Web analytics software can help online merchants detect click fraud. Large 
numbers of visitors who leave within seconds of arriving at a site, computer IP addresses that ap-
pear from all over the world, and pay-per-click costs that rise without any corresponding increase
in sales are clues that a company is a victim of click fraud.
Designing a Killer Web Site
Setting up a shop online has never been easier, but creating a Web site that drives sales requires 
time and commitment. To be successful, entrepreneurs must pay careful attention to the look, 
feel, efficiency, and navigability of their Web sites and the impression their sites create with 
shoppers. A site’s look and design determine a visitor’s first impression of the company. “Your 
Web site isn’t ‘about’ your company,” says one writer. “It’s an extension of your company. If it’s

unprofessional, you’re unprofessional. If it’s cluttered, you’re cluttered. If it’s hard to work with,
you’re hard to work with. By contrast, if it’s well put together, smart, and easy to use, so is your 
company.”104 Unfortunately, according to HubSpot’s Marketing Grader, 72 percent of Web sites
earn a failing grade. “A Web site is an engine that runs on remarkable content being pumped
into it day after day,” says one e-commerce expert. “The goal of a Web site is to attract visitors, 
convert leads, and delight customers. Your business won’t see those benefits unless you turn your 
After Michael Lowe retired from his work as an attorney for 
Verizon Communications, he was bored and looking for a new 
challenge in life. His son-in-law, John Uselton, who had experience 
in the beverage distribution and hospitality industries, approached 
him with the idea of opening a gin distillery in Washington, DC.
Distilling spirits requires a federal permit and is rife with regula-
tions, but the determined entrepreneurs managed to work their 
way through all of the regulatory requirements and opened New
Columbia Distillers, the first distillery in the nation’s capital since
Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-
tion that ushered in Prohibition. To hone their distilling skills, Lowe
and Uselton engaged internships at the Dry Fly Distilling School in 
Spokane, Washington. “We trained to the point where the opera-
tors let us make entire product batches,” says Uselton.
After returning to Washington, DC, Lowe and Uselton 
leased an empty warehouse and spent the next year installing
all of the infrastructure and equipment their distillery process re-
quired. In a clever marketing maneuver, they decided to name 
their product Green Hat Gin in honor of George Cassiday, who 
made a successful career providing bootleg liquor to many Con-
gressmen during Prohibition. The dapper Cassiday, who actually 
set up an office in basement of the House office building and 
later the Senate office building, was famous for the green fedora 
he always wore.
Because each batch their company distills produces only 
about 50 cases of gin, the supply of Green Hat Gin is limited, 
which heightens the importance of the company’s marketing
efforts. The entrepreneurial duo and their wives, who also help 
with the business, knew that their company’s Web site would be 
a significant part of its success and that it had to resonate with 
their contemporary, tech-savvy target market, yet it also had to 
reflect the nostalgic feel of the Prohibition era. Lowe and Uselton 
used a small, local creative firm, Design Army, owned by copreneurs 
Jake and Pum Lefebure, to design the Green Hat Gin logo and
Web site. The distinctive site features the look of a catalog from
the 1920s with a distinctive hat motif and includes sections about 
Prohibition, the company, its namesake, its products, and the dis-
tilling process. In addition to its vintage look, it also includes fonts 
that are reminiscent of newspapers of the era. Visitors also can
sign up for e-mail updates about new products, tasting tours, spe-
cial events, and bottling parties, in which they can show up at the
distillery and help bottle the latest batch. The site also includes 
cocktail recipes that use gin (of course). The design team’s goal 
was to emphasize the unique nature of New Columbia Distillers’ 
Green Hat Gin by creating a Web site that has a look and feel all
its own and that is completely different from the Web sites of 
traditional spirits companies. The design also is consistent with 
New Columbia Distillers’ image, style, and personality. “We didn’t
want to create just a click, click, click site,” says Jake Lefebure. 
“We wanted something more fluid and smooth, in the same way 
you would read a newspaper. We also knew a lot of users would 
be on mobile and tablets, so making it natural to those devices 
was the way to go.” Despite the site’s simple navigation and vin-
tage look, its underlying mechanics are very much cutting-edge.
The Web site is doing its job. Lowe says many customers who 
visit the distillery say the company’s spectacular Web site convinced 
them to see it in person. “Good design is no longer just cosmetic 
or ‘making something pretty,’” says Pum Lefebure. “Good design-
ers think strategically.”

Web site into an inbound marketing machine that presents your brand as a thought leader with 
fresh offers, landing pages, calls-to-action, new media, social conversations, and other content 
assets. By creating such content, you grow traffic and leads organically without having to rely on 
paid campaigns.”105
How can entrepreneurs design Web sites that capture and hold potential customers’ atten-
tion long enough to make a sale? What can they do to keep customers coming back on a regular 
basis? There is no surefire formula for providing a best-in-class online shopping experience, but 
the following suggestions will help:
START WITH YOUR TARGET CUSTOMER Before launching into the design of their Web sites, 
entrepreneurs must develop a clear picture of their target customers. Only then will they be ready
to design a site that appeals to their customers. The goal is create a design in which customers see
themselves when they visit. Creating a site with which customers find a comfortable fit requires 
a careful blend of market research, sales know-how, and aesthetics. The challenge for a business 
on the Web is to create the same image, style, and ambiance in its online presence as in its offline 
stores. For example, a Web site that sells discount baby clothing will have an entirely different 
look and feel than one that sells upscale outdoor gear.
GIVE CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY WANT The main reason people shop online is convenience.
Online companies that fail to provide a fast, efficient, and flawless shopping experience for their 
customers will not succeed. A well-designed Web site is intuitive, leading customers to a series of 
actions that are natural and result in a sale. Sites that provide customers with meaningful content 
and allow them to find what they are looking for easily and to pay for it conveniently and securely
keep customers coming back. High-quality images of products with alternative views that allow 
customers to zoom in for detail, rotate them 360 degrees, and see color changes showcase a
company’s products and increase sales. Product descriptions should be simple, detailed, and 
jargon-free. Videos that show product details or the product in use not only increase customer 
traffic but also produce higher conversion rates. The goal is to eliminate any element that causes 
friction—a lengthy registration process, confusing navigation, cluttered pages, and others—
in customers’ shopping experience. Online customers also expect a personalized shopping
experience on a Web site that “remembers” their tastes and preferences and recalls information 
that maximizes the efficiency of their visit. “By understanding a shopper, a retailer can recommend
the right products at the right time,” says Rama Ramakrishnan, CEO of CQuotient. “The most 
effective strategy is to harness big data to find nuanced signals about their tastes, predispositions, 
and interests and then incorporate that into one-to-one marketing.”106
SELECT AN INTUITIVE DOMAIN NAME Decide on a domain name that is consistent with the image
you want to create for your company and register it. Entrepreneurs should never underestimate 
the power of the right domain name or URL. It not only tells online shoppers where to find a
company but also should suggest something about the company and what it does. Entrepreneurs 
must recognize that a domain name is part of the brand they are creating and should create the 
proper image for the company.
The ideal domain name should be as follows:
● Short. Short names are easy for people to remember, so the shorter a company’s URL is,
the more likely it is that potential customers will recall it.
● Memorable. Not every short domain name is necessarily memorable. Some business own-
ers use their companies’ initials as their domain name (e.g., www.sbfo.com for Stanley 
Brothers Furniture Outlet). The problem with using initials for a domain name is that cus-
tomers rarely associate the two, making a company virtually invisible on the Web.
● Indicative of a company’s business or business name. Perhaps the best domain name for 
a company is one that customers can guess easily if they know the company’s name. For 
instance, mail order catalog company J.Crew’s URL is www.jcrew.com, and New Pig, a 
maker of absorbent materials for a variety of industrial applications, uses www.newpig
.com as its domain name. (The company carries this concept over to its toll-free number, 
which is 1-800-HOT-HOGS.)

370
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
● Easy to spell. Even though a company’s domain name may be easy to spell, it is usu-
ally wise to buy several variations of the correct spelling simply because some customers 
are not likely to be good spellers!
Just because entrepreneurs come up with the perfect URL for their companies’ Web sites does 
not necessarily mean they can use them. With more than 265 million registered domain names 
(115 million of which end in “.com”), finding the perfect domain name can be a challenge, but the 
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the organization officially in charge of 
domain names worldwide, recently authorized the use of generic top level domain names (TLDs) 
such as .app, .dance, .beauty, .pizza, .bike, and others, increasing the number of TLDs from about 
two dozen to thousands.107 Domain names are given on a first-come, first-served basis. Before
business owners can use a domain name, they must ensure that someone else has not already taken
it. The simplest way to do that is to go to a domain name registration service such as Network 
Solutions’ (www.networksolutions.com), Netnames (www.netnames.com), or Go Daddy (www
.godaddy.com) to conduct a name search. Once entrepreneurs find an unused name that is suitable,
they should register it (plus any variations of it)—and the sooner, the better! Registering is quite
easy: simply use one of the registration services cited previously to fill out a form and pay the 
necessary fees. The next step is to register the domain name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office (USPTO) at a cost of $275. The office’s Web site (www.uspto.gov) not only allows users
to register a trademark online but also offers useful information on trademarks and the protection
they offer.
MAKE YOUR WEB SITE EASY TO NAVIGATE Research shows that the primary factor that leads 
shoppers to choose one Web site over another is ease of navigation and searching.108 The starting 
point for evaluating a site’s navigability is to conduct a user test. Find several willing shoppers,
sit them down in front of a computer, and watch them as they cruise through the company’s Web 
site to make a purchase. It is one of the best ways to get meaningful, immediate feedback on 
the navigability of a site. Watching these test customers as they navigate the site also is useful. 
Where do they pause? Do they get lost in the site? Are they confused by the choices the site gives
them? Is the checkout process too complex? Are the navigation buttons from one page of the 
site to another clearly marked, and do they make sense? (One popular Web site critic says sites
with vague navigation tools are guilty of “mystery meat navigation.”) Web analytics tools (more 
about these later in this chapter) also offer insight into how long visitors spend on a company’s
Web site, where they abandon the site, how they arrived, and much other valuable feedback for 
improving site navigability. The most successful e-commerce companies constantly test various
design elements on their sites using “A/B tests” (e.g., sending visitors to two sites, one with less 
text and more photos) to see which ones produce the highest conversion rates.
Because many visitors do not start from a Web site’s home page, the starting point for easy 
navigability involves creating the right landing pages, the pages on which visitors land after 
they click on a sponsored link in a search engine, e-mail ad, or online ad. Ideally, each landing 
page should have the same marketing message as the link that led to it; otherwise, customers are
likely to abandon the site immediately (an occurrence that is measured by a site’s “bounce rate,” 
the percentage of visits in which customers leave a site from the landing page). In addition to 
including a clear call to action, a good landing page also allows customers to search or to dig 
deeper into the company’s Web site to the products or services they are seeking. Unfortunately, 
20 percent of small businesses send shoppers who click on paid listings to their sites’ home page 
rather than to a customized landing page.109
Successful Web sites recognize that shoppers employ different strategies to make a purchase. 
Some shoppers want to use a search tool, others want to browse through product categories, and 
still others prefer a company to make product recommendations. Effective sites accommodate 
all three strategies in their design. Two important Web site design features that online companies 
often get wrong involve the mechanisms by which customers locate products and then get infor-
mation about them:
Locating products. Customers won’t buy what they cannot find! Products should be easy 
for customers to find, no matter how many pages a Web site includes. Too often, online 
companies do a poor job of product categorization, listing their product lines in ways that 
landing pages

land after they click on a 
sponsored link in a search 
engine, e-mail ad, or

may make sense to them but that befuddle the typical shopper. User tests can be extremely 
helpful in revealing product categorization problems. After redesigning its landing pages to 
include less text, a more visible unique selling proposition above the “fold” (the portion of 
the screen that does not require a user to scroll down), and a more prominent call to action, 
Kwik Fit, an insurance company based in the United Kingdom, increased its conversion 
rate by 78 percent.110
In addition to establishing simple product categories that reflect the way customers 
actually shop (e.g., including categories such as business dress, business casual, sportswear, 
outerwear, formal wear, shoes, and accessories for a clothing store), another simple solution 
is to use an internal search tool. An easy-to-use internal search tool can pay for itself many 
times over in higher conversion rates and increased sales. To make the search feature use-
ful, it should appear in the same place on every page in the site (usually the top right). An 
internal search tool reveals extremely useful information about which items shoppers are 
looking for and how they search for them, information that online merchants can use in their 
key word strategies for paid listings. Rather than building their own internal search engines, 
many online companies use one of Google’s Enterprise Search tools, which can cost as 
little as $100 a year, to power customer searches on their sites. Managers at Coupon Chief,
a directory of online coupons to more than 1,000 e-commerce retailers, replaced the home-
grown search function on the company’s Web site with a Google search engine and saw the 
number of successful searches that customers experienced increase by 200 percent.111
Getting product information. Once a site is designed to enable shoppers to find products 
easily, the next task online merchants face is to provide enough product information to con-
vince shoppers to buy. Incomplete product information sends online customers scurrying to 
competitors’ sites. Unlike at brick-and-mortar stores, customers cannot pick up an item, try 
it on, or engage a salesperson in a face-to-face conversation about its features and merits. 
Online merchants must walk a fine line because providing too little information may fail to 
answer the questions customers have, causing them to abandon their shopping carts. On the 
other hand, providing too much information can overwhelm customers who aren’t willing 
to wade through reams of text just to find the answer to some basic questions. The solution 
is to provide basic product information in easy-to-understand terms (always including a 
picture of the item with the option to zoom in on it) and a link to more detailed information 
(which should be only one click away) that customers can click to if they choose.
OFFER SUGGESTIONS FOR RELATED PRODUCTS Many online merchants increase sales with
the help of “searchandising” techniques, which combine internal searches with merchandising 
techniques that are designed to cross sell. For example, a customer who enters the words “French 
cuff shirt” into a company’s search tool might see a link to the company’s selection of cufflinks 
and ties in addition to all of the French cuff shirts that appear. Amazon.com is famous for the 
success of its searchandising techniques, including its “customers who bought this item also 
bought . . . ” product suggestions.
ADD WISH LIST CAPABILITY Giving customers the ability to create wish lists of products and 
services they want and then connecting other people to those lists, often using social media, not 
only boosts a company’s sales but also increases its online visibility.
CREATE A GIFT IDEA CENTER Online retailers have discovered that one of the most successful
tools for improving their conversion rates is to offer a gift idea center. A gift idea center is a section 
of a Web site that includes a variety of gift ideas that shoppers can browse for ideas based on 
price, gender, or category. Gift centers can provide a huge boost for e-tailers, particularly around
holidays, because they offer creative suggestions for shoppers looking for the perfect gift.
PROVIDE CUSTOMER RATINGS AND REVIEWS Customer ratings and reviews are extremely 
important to online shoppers, second only to the ability to conduct searches as a Web site’s most 
important feature. One recent study reports that 70 percent of shoppers consult reviews or ratings 
before making a purchase and that 87 percent of shoppers’ buying decisions are influenced by 
positive reviews. In addition, customers who read reviews are 105 percent more likely to make a 

372
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
purchase and spend 11 percent more than those who do not read reviews.112 Allowing customers
to post product reviews and ratings enhances a site’s credibility and leads to increased sales. 
Online companies that include reviews benefit from conversion rates that are 74 percent higher 
and customer loyalty rates that are 18 percent higher than those of companies that do not offer 
reviews.113 Many companies include a review widget that enables customers to post reviews
quickly and easily, and some offer incentives for customers to post reviews. Businesses also
must monitor their online profiles, being alert to inevitable customer complaints of poor service 
or product quality problems. Ideally, a company addresses customers’ negative reviews and 
comments quickly with the goal of resolving their problems. The lesson: Companies must 
focus on earning and maintaining stellar reputations by providing value and excellent shopping 
experiences for their customers.
USE ONLINE VIDEOS Online shoppers expect to encounter Web sites that feature useful video 
content. According to a recent study by the e-tailing group Invodo, 35 percent of shoppers watch 
online videos most or all of the time they encounter them, and 67 percent watch videos at least 
some of the time. Shoppers who view videos have more confidence in making online purchases 
and are more likely to make purchases than those who do not. Adding video to a Web site not 
only increases its customer conversion rate but also increases its average sale and improves its
search engine ranking.114 Smart online entrepreneurs include more than mere product videos on
their Web sites, creating instead videos that offer viewers (i.e., potential customers) something of 
value—a virtual factory tour that shows the company’s dedication to quality, customer testimonials
about the company’s service, or informational videos that teach customers something. Stacks 
and Stacks, an online retailer founded in 1984 by Mel Ronick with an inventory of more than
40,000 products for organizing and furnishing homes, includes videos on some of its product 
pages that not only show products in action but also a customer service representative explaining 
how they work and how to install them. According to the company’s analytics, shoppers who
view videos are 144 percent more likely to purchase the product than those who do not.115
Once companies create video content, they can share it (and encourage others to share it) with 
potential customers by posting it on social media sites such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Pinterest.
A video posted on YouTube, the most popular video Web site, that includes a link to the com-
pany’s site drives traffic to a company’s site. YouTube’s Analytics offer business owners analytic 
tools that give them the ability to determine how effective the videos they post are at reaching 
potential customers. These tools show entrepreneurs how many times their videos have been 
viewed over a period of time, how popular their videos are compared to other YouTube videos, 
how viewers discovered their videos, what the basic demographics of their viewers are, and other 
useful information.
ESTABLISH THE APPROPRIATE CALL TO ACTION ON EACH PAGE Every page of a Web site 
should have a purpose, steering customers to take a specific action—place an order, review the 
company’s services, request a consultation, read customer testimonials, and more. Make sure the
call to action on every page is highly visible and appropriate. Unfortunately, one recent study
reports that 70 percent of small business Web sites had no call to action on their home pages, and
72 percent had no call to action on the internal pages of their sites.116
BUILD LOYALTY BY GIVING ONLINE CUSTOMERS A REASON TO RETURN Just as with brick-and-
mortar retailers, e-tailers that constantly have to incur the expense of attracting new customers 
find it difficult to remain profitable because of the extra cost required to acquire customers. One
of the most effective ways to encourage customers to return to a site is to establish an incentive 
program that rewards them for repeat purchases. Frequent-buyer programs that offer discounts or 
points toward future purchases, giveaways such as T-shirts emblazoned with a company’s logo, 
or special services are common components of incentive programs. Incentive programs that are
properly designed with a company’s target customer in mind really work.
ESTABLISH HYPERLINKS WITH OTHER BUSINESSES, PREFERABLY THOSE SELLING PRODUCTS OR 
SERVICES THAT COMPLEMENT YOURS Listing the Web addresses of complementary businesses
on a company’s site and having them list its address on their sites offer customers more value and 
can bring traffic to your site that you otherwise would have missed. For instance, the owner of 

CHAPTER 9 • E-COMMERCE AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
373
a site selling upscale kitchen gadgets should consider a cross-listing arrangement with sites that 
feature gourmet recipes, wines, and kitchen appliances.
INCLUDE AN E-MAIL OPTION, A PHYSICAL ADDRESS, AND A TELEPHONE NUMBER Customers
appreciate the opportunity to communicate with your company, and your Web site should give them
many options for doing so. When you include e-mail access on your site, be sure to respond to it 
promptly. Nothing alienates customers faster than a company that is slow to respond or that fails to 
respond to their e-mail messages. Including a physical address (with an interactive map feature) is
important because shoppers frequently use their smart phones to locate businesses. Unfortunately, 
60 percent of small companies fail to post their business addresses on their Web sites. In addition, 
businesses should include a toll-free telephone number for customers who prefer to call with their 
questions. Unfortunately, nearly 50 percent of small companies fail to include their telephone
numbers on their sites or bury them so deeply within the site’s pages that customers never find them.117
GIVE SHOPPERS THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEIR ORDERS ONLINE Many customers who order 
items online want to track the progress of their orders. One of the most effective ways to keep 
customers happy is to send an e-mail confirmation that your company received their orders and 
another e-mail notification when you ship the orders. The shipment notice should include the 
shipper’s tracking number and instructions on how to track the order from the shipper’s site. 
Order and shipping confirmations instill confidence in even the most Web-wary shoppers.
OFFER ONLINE SHOPPERS A SPECIAL ALL THEIR OWN Give online customers a special deal that 
you don’t offer in any other advertising piece. Change your specials often (weekly, if possible)
and use clever “teasers” to draw attention to the offer. Regular special offers available only on the 
Internet give customers an incentive to return to a company’s site.
USE THE POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA Make it easy for customers to connect with your company on 
social media such as Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and others by including social media sharing 
links and links to your company’s social media pages on your Web site.
FOLLOW A SIMPLE DESIGN Catchy graphics and photographs are important to snaring customers, 
but designers must choose them carefully. Designs that are overly complex take a long time to 
download, and customers are likely to move on before they appear. Web Site Garage (http://
thewebsitegarage.com/), a Web site maintenance company, offers companies a free 21-point 
inspection of their Web sites and a report that describes problems ranging from slow download 
speeds to poor search engine rankings and their potential solutions.
Following are some specific design tips:
● Avoid clutter, especially on your site’s home page. The best designs are simple and elegant 
with a balance of both text and graphics. A minimalist approach usually works best.
● Use less text on your site’s homepage, landing pages, and initial product or service pages. 
Although including detailed, text-heavy content deeper in your site is acceptable and even 
desirable; incorporating too much text early on dissuades customers. Allow customers to 
drill down to more detailed product and service descriptions.
● Avoid huge graphic headers that must download first, prohibiting customers from seeing 
anything else on your site as they wait (or, more likely, don’t wait). Use graphics judi
t
-
ciously so that the site loads quickly. Recall that customers abandon Web sites that load 
slowly. For impatient online shoppers, faster is better.
● Include a menu bar at the top of the page that makes it easy for customers to find their way 
around the site.
● Make the site easy to navigate by including navigation buttons at the bottom of pages that 
enable customers to return to the top of the page or to the menu bar. This avoids what one
expert calls the “pogo effect,” when visitors bounce from page to page in a Web site look-
ing for what they need. Without navigation buttons or a site map page, a company runs 
the risk of customers getting lost in its site and leaving. An online merchant never knows 
which page a customer will land on; therefore, it is important for each page to provide a 
consistent look, relevant and concise content, and easy navigation.

374
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
● Minimize the number of clicks required for a customer to get to any particular page in the 
site. Long paths increase the likelihood of customers bailing out before they reach their 
intended destination.
● Incorporate meaningful content in the site that is useful to visitors, well organized, easy to
read, and current. The content should be consistent with the message a company sends in
the other advertising media it uses. Update the site’s content frequently. Although a Web 
site should be designed to sell, providing useful, current information attracts visitors, keeps
them coming back, and establishes a company’s reputation as an expert in the field.
● Connect the company’s Web site to its social media pages so that posts on social
media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and others appear on the 
company’s site.
● Include a “frequently asked questions” (FAQ) section. Adding this section to a page can 
reduce dramatically the number of telephone calls and e-mails customer service representa-
tives must handle. FAQ sections typically span a wide range of issues—from how to place
an order to how to return merchandise—and cover whatever topics customers most often 
want to know about.
● Be sure to post prominently privacy and return policies as well as product guarantees the 
company offers.
● If your site is heavy on content, say, 100 or more pages, or has more than 100 products for 
sale, include a search tool that allows visitors to find the product or information they want.
Smaller, simpler sites can get by without a search tool if they are organized properly.

● Avoid fancy typefaces and small fonts because they are too hard to read. Limit font and 
color choices to two or three to avoid a circus look.
● Be vigilant for misspelled words, typographical errors, and formatting mistakes; they 
destroy a site’s credibility.
● Avoid using small fonts on “busy” backgrounds; no one will read them!
● Use contrasting colors of text and graphics. For instance, blue text on a green background 
is nearly impossible to read.
● Be careful with frames. Using frames that are so thick they crowd out text makes for a 
poor design.
● Test the site on different Web browsers. A Web site may look exactly the way it was de-
signed to look on one Web browser and be a garbled mess on another.
● Use your Web site to collect information from visitors but don’t tie up visitors immedi-
ately with a tedious registration process. Most will simply leave the site, never to return. 
Allow new customers to complete purchases without registering but give them the option
of saving their customer information for easy ordering in the future. Be sure to make the 
registration process short. Offers for a free e-mail newsletter or a contest giveaway can give
visitors enough incentive to register with a site.
● Avoid automated music that plays continuously and cannot be cut off.
● Make sure the overall look of the page is appealing. “When a site is poorly designed, lacks
information, or cannot support customer needs, that [company’s] reputation is seriously 
jeopardized,” says one expert.118
● Remember that simpler is almost always better.
CREATE A FAST, SIMPLE CHECKOUT PROCESS One surefire way to destroy an online company’s 
conversion rate is to impose a lengthy, convoluted checkout process that requires customers to
wade through pages of forms to fill out just to complete a purchase. When faced with a lengthy 
checkout process, customers simply abandon a site and make their purchases elsewhere; therefore,

CHAPTER 9 • E-COMMERCE AND THE ENTREPRENEUR

businesses should offer a “guest checkout” option but include incentives to encourage shoppers to 
register. The fewer the steps required for customers to check out, the more successful is a site at 
generating sales. (A study by Smashing magazine reports that the checkout processes of the top 
100 grossing Web sites require an average of 5 steps.119) A progress indicator that shows customers 
where they are in the checkout process also can help, and businesses should avoid asking customers 
to enter the same information more than once.
Entrepreneurs must make sure that their sites’ display a prominent “add to cart” button in the 
same place on every page to ensure that customers can make their purchases easily. Once cus-
tomers put items into a shopping cart, they should be able to see a complete list and photographs
of the products they have selected and should be able to access more information about them 
with one click. The page also should display security logos to remind shoppers that their online 
transactions are secure. The cart should display the price of each item in the cart in the shopper’s
local currency. The cart also should allow customers to change product quantities (and, believe 
it or not, to remove items from the cart) without having to go back to a product page. Every cart 
should have a “return to shopping” link in it as well.
PROVIDE CUSTOMERS MULTIPLE PAYMENT OPTIONS Because some customers are skittish about 
using their credit cards online, online merchants should offer the option to pay by PayPal, Google
Checkout, Apple Pay, or other payment services.
ASSURE CUSTOMERS THAT THEIR ONLINE TRANSACTIONS ARE SECURE If you are serious about 
doing business on the Web, make sure that your site includes the proper security software and 
encryption devices. The average amount of an online order is $199, and missing a sale because 
your site lacks proper security makes no sense!120 Web-savvy customers are not willing to divulge 
their credit card information on sites that are not secure.
ESTABLISH REASONABLE SHIPPING AND HANDLING CHARGES AND POST THEM UP FRONT The 
number one reason that shoppers do not buy more goods online is high shipping costs. A closely 
related gripe among online shoppers is that some e-tailers reveal their shipping and handling 
charges too late in the checkout process. Responsible online merchants keep shipping and 
handling charges reasonable and display them early on in the buying process to avoid customer 
“cart shock.” Merchants have discovered that free shipping (often with a minimum purchase 
amount) is a powerful tool for boosting online sales because more shoppers have come to expect it. 
However, because shipping costs have risen quickly in recent years, online merchants must 
balance the need to convert browsers into buyers with free or low-cost shipping and keeping 
costs under control. L. L. Bean, the online and catalog retailer of outdoor clothing and gear, offers 
free shipping on all orders to its customers, tangible evidence of the company’s commitment to 
superior customer service.
CONFIRM TRANSACTIONS When customers complete their orders, a Web site should display
a confirmation page. In addition, order confirmation e-mails, which a company can generate 
automatically, let customers know that the company received the online order and can be an 
important first line of defense against online fraud. If a customer claims not to have placed the 
order, the company can cancel it and report the credit card information as suspicious. Confirmation 
e-mails can contain ads or coupons for future purchases, but they should be short.
KEEP YOUR SITE UPDATED Customers want to see something new when they visit stores, and 
they expect the same when they visit virtual stores as well. Entrepreneurs must be diligent about 
deleting links that have disappeared and keeping the information on their sites current. Yet, making 
time to update their companies’ Web sites often is crowded out by all of the other demands on 
entrepreneurs’ time; 64 percent of small business owners say the greatest challenge they face
with their Web sites is finding time to update it.121 One sure way to run off customers on the Web 
is to continue to advertise your company’s “Christmas Special” in August! Fresh information and 
new specials keep customers coming back. Smart entrepreneurs are always looking for new ways
to engage their customers with interesting, relevant content.
TEST YOUR SITE OFTEN Smart e-commerce entrepreneurs check their sites frequently to make 
sure they are running smoothly and not causing customers unexpected problems. A good rule of 
thumb is to check your site at least monthly—or weekly if its content changes frequently.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
RELY ON ANALYTICS TO IMPROVE YOUR SITE Web analytics (see the following section) provide 
a host of useful information, ranging from the key words that shoppers use to find your site and
how long they stay on it to the number of visitors and their locations. The best way to increase a 
site’s conversion rate is to use analytics to determine which techniques work best and integrate 
them throughout the site.
CONSIDER HIRING A PROFESSIONAL TO DESIGN YOUR SITE Pros can do it a lot faster and better 
than you can. However, don’t give designers free rein to do whatever they want to with your site. 
Make sure it meets your criteria for an effective site that can sell.
Entrepreneurs must remember that on the Internet, every company, no matter how big or 
small it is, has the same screen size for its site. What matters most is not the size of your company
but how you put that screen size to use. Figure 9.7 illustrates the purchase funnel and ways that 
companies can improve customers’ online shopping experience.
Tracking Web Results
Web sites offer entrepreneurs a treasure trove of valuable information about how well their 
sites are performing—if they take the time to analyze it. Web analytics, tools that measure a
Web site’s ability to attract customers, generate sales, and keep customers coming back, help
entrepreneurs to know what works—and what doesn’t—on their sites. Online companies that use
Web analytics have an advantage over those that do not. Unfortunately, only 25 percent of small 
businesses use Web analytics to track traffic patterns on their sites and to strategically refashion
them to improve their sites’ performance.122 Owners who use analytics review the data collected
from their customers’ Web site activity, analyze them, make adjustments to their Web sites, and 
then start the monitoring process over again to see whether the changes improve the site’s per-
formance. In other words, Web analytics give entrepreneurs the ability to apply the principles of 
continuous improvement to their sites. In addition, the changes these e-business owners make are 
based on facts (the data from the Web analytics) rather than on mere guesses about how custom-
ers interact with a site. Google Analytics is the most popular Web analytics system on the market 
(and is linked to Google’s popular AdWords program), but many other companies also offer Web 
analytics software packages. The most effective ones offer the following types of information,
often in real time:
● Commerce metrics. These are basic analytics, such as sales revenue generated, number of 
items sold, and best sellers (and not-so-best sellers).
● Visitor segmentation measurements. These measurements provide entrepreneurs with 
valuable information about online shoppers and customers, including whether they are 
return or new customers, how they arrived at the site (e.g., via a search engine or a pay-
per-click ad), which search terms they used (if they used a search engine), where they are

located, and what type of device they are using. The number of repeat visitors to a site is 
important because it is an indication of customer loyalty. A high percentage of repeat cus-
tomers benefits a business because selling to an existing customer is much easier than sell-
ing to a first-time customer.
● Content reports. This information tells entrepreneurs which products customers are look-
ing for and which pages they view most often (and least often), how they navigate through 
the site, how long they stay, which pages they are on when they exit, and more. Using this 
information, an entrepreneur can get an idea of how effective the site’s design is.
● Process measurements. These metrics help entrepreneurs to understand how their Web
sites attract visitors and convert them into customers. Does the checkout process work 
smoothly? How often do shoppers abandon their carts? At what point in the process do 
they abandon them? These measures can lead to higher conversion rates for an online 
business.
Other common measures of Web site performance include the following:
● The cost per acquisition is the cost a company incurs to generate each purchase (or 
customer registration):
Cost per acquisition = Total cost of acquiring a new customer ÷ Number of new customers
For example, if a company purchases an advertisement in an e-magazine for $200 and it 
yields 15 new customers, then the cost of acquisition is $200 ÷ 15 = $13.33.
● The average number of page views per visit is a measure of how much time visitors 
spend on a site (visit duration). Sites that visitors find useful and provide them with mean-
ingful content tend to have longer visit durations that show up as higher numbers of page 
views per visit.
● The bounce rate is the percentage of visitors to a company’s Web site who view a single
page and leave without viewing other pages. A high bounce rate indicates that a company’s 
Web site lacks credibility or meaningful content that attracts customers’ attention or suffers 
from some other malady. The bounce rate is calculated as follows:
Bounce rate = Number of single-page viewers ÷ Total number of visitors
● The conversion (browse-to-buy) rate is the proportion of visitors to a site who actually 
make a purchase. It is one of the most important measures of Web success and is calculated
as follows:
Conversion rate = Number of customers who make a purchase ÷ Number of visitors to the site
Although conversion rates vary dramatically across industries, the average conversion rate 
is 2.55 percent.123 In other words, out of every 1,000 people who visit a typical Web site,
about 26 of them actually make a purchase. The longer a site’s average visit duration and 
the lower its bounce rate, the higher its conversion rate. Only 28 percent of companies are 
satisfied with their conversion rates.124 The best way for a company to increase its conver-
sion rate is to constantly conduct A/B tests (showing two versions of the same page to visi-
tors) to identify designs, deals, and details that work best.
● The cart abandonment rate is the percentage of shoppers who place at least one item in a 
shopping cart but never complete the transaction:
Cart abandonment rate = 1 − (Number of customers who complete a transaction 
÷ Number of shoppers who place at least one item in a shopping cart)
If 500 shoppers place at least one item in a shopping cart but only 175 of them complete 
their transactions, the company’s cart abandonment rate is 1 − (175 ÷ 500) = 65 percent.
● The search engine ranking shows where a company’s Web site ranks in search engines’ 
results pages. Recall that almost 92 percent of search engine users click on a link to a site 
that appears on the first page of the search results, which means that unless a company’s 
site shows up on that first page of results, it is almost invisible online.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Ensuring Web Privacy and Security
Privacy
The Web’s ability to track customers’ every move naturally raises concerns over the privacy of 
the information companies collect. Concerns about privacy and security are two of the greatest 
obstacles to the growth of e-commerce. E-commerce gives businesses access to tremendous vol-
umes of information about their customers, creating a responsibility to protect that information 
and to use it wisely. To make sure they are using the information they collect from visitors to their 
Web sites legally and ethically, companies should take the following steps:
Take an inventory of the customer data collected. The first step to ensuring proper data 
handling is to assess exactly the type of data the company is collecting and storing. How 
are you collecting them? Why are you collecting them? How are you using them? Do 
visitors know how you are using the data? Do you need to get their permission to use them 
in this way? Do you use all of the data you are collecting?
Develop a company privacy policy for the information you collect. A privacy policy is a 
statement explaining the nature of the information a company collects online, what it does 
with that information, and what recourse customers have if they believe the company is 
misusing the information. Every online company should have a privacy policy, but many do 
not. Several online privacy firms, such as TRUSTe (www.truste.org), BBBOnline (www
.bbbonline.com), and BetterWeb (www.betterweb.com) offer Web “seal programs,” the
equivalent of the Good Housekeeping seal of privacy approval. To earn a privacy seal of 
approval, a company must adopt a privacy policy, implement it, and monitor its effective-
ness. Many of these privacy sites also provide online policy wizards, which are automated
questionnaires that help e-business owners create comprehensive privacy statements.
Post your company’s privacy policy prominently on your Web site and follow it. Creating 
a privacy policy is not sufficient; posting it in a prominent place on the Web site (it should 
be accessible from every page on the Web site) and then abiding by it make a policy mean-
ingful. One of the worst mistakes a company can make is to publish its privacy policy 
online and then to fail to follow it. Not only is this unethical, but it also can lead to serious 
damage awards if customers take legal action against the company.
Security
For online merchants, shoppers’ concerns over privacy and security translate into lost sales. One 
recent survey reports that half of online shoppers are concerned about their privacy, security, and
safety when they make online purchases.125 Ninety-eight percent of the data that cybercriminals 
target involves customer records stolen from companies for the purpose of identity theft, which 
affects 12.6 million people annually.126 Every company with a Web site, no matter how small, is 
a potential target for hackers and other cybercriminals. Cybercrime has become a big business,
costing U.S. companies an estimated $100 billion per year.127 Small companies are not immune 
to cyberattacks; 44 percent of small business owners say their companies have been victims of 
a cyber-attack.128 In fact, security experts have seen a sharp increase in the number of cyberat-
tacks aimed at small companies. The main reason small businesses have become more frequent 
targets of hackers and criminals is that they typically have in place weaker security measures than
large companies. A survey by the National Small Business Association reports that 72 percent of 
small businesses handle their online security in-house (either the business owner or an employee). 
Alarmingly, 6 percent of business owners say that no one handles their online security.129 Cyberat-
tacks threaten the very existence of the typical small business; Google usually “blacklists” com-
panies that suffer cyberattacks, which renders them virtual nonentities online. In addition, nearly
60 percent of companies that are victims of cyberattacks close their doors within six months.130
Businesses have a number of safeguards available to them, but hackers with enough time, 
talent, and determination usually can beat even the most sophisticated safety measures. If hackers
manage to break into a system, they can do irreparable damage, stealing programs and sensitive 
customer data, modifying or deleting valuable information, changing the look and content of 
sites, or crashing sites altogether.

CHAPTER 9 • E-COMMERCE AND THE ENTREPRENEUR

An entrepreneur’s quest for the ideal Web site is like legendary 
King Arthur’s knights’ search for the Holy Grail: challenging and 
never-ending. Although creating the “perfect” Web site is an im-
possible dream, entrepreneurs can build sites that land customers
and create conversions by focusing on employing proper design
elements and providing relevant content. The following tips and 
techniques will help:
•
Make sure that your site creates a positive first 
impression. Research at several leading universities has 
revealed that visitors to Web sites make decisions about
their appeal and credibility extremely quickly, typically in just 
50 to 500 milliseconds. At this point, design rules. A site’s 
content is important, but 94 percent of the typical visitor’s
first impressions of a Web site are design dependent. 
Customers who find a Web site visually appealing also 
perceive it as trustworthy. The following basic design 
elements are most important:
•
Color. Select colors for your site that are consistent with 
your company’s logo and image and that convey its per-
sonality. For example, Tiffany and Company, the upscale 
jeweler, uses its signature Tiffany blue extensively on its 
Web site.
•
Fonts. Fonts must be easy to read.
•
Photographs. Whenever possible, use photographs of 
your company’s products and people rather than stock 
photos. Restaurants, for example, should include photo-
graphs of their own dishes.
•
Consistency. Avoid using too many colors and too many
fonts. Colors, fonts, button styles, and graphics should 
be consistent throughout the site.
•
Design your site with an understanding of how users 
interact with it. Eye-tracking studies show that visitors’ 
eyes follow “F” and “E” patterns, scanning horizontally 
less often as they move down a page, when viewing Web 
sites. Therefore, designers should place the most important 
information in the first two paragraphs of each page so that 
it appears above the “fold” (the portion of the page visitors 
see without having to scroll down) because that is where
visitors spend 80 percent of their time. The left side of a 
Web page contains its most valuable real estate because us-
ers spend 69 percent of their time looking there. You should 
put your company logo in the top left corner of each page 
because visitors remember a logo positioned there 58.4 per-
cent more often than those located in any other area.
•
Simplicity reigns. Web designers are discovering that the
simplest designs usually are most effective, especially given 
the shift away from desktop computers toward mobile 
devices. Simple design coupled with intuitive navigation 
lead to higher conversion rates. “If you load a page on your 
desktop and then step back six feet from the monitor, you 
should still be able to get a general gist of what is going on, 
what the site does, and how you would start digging in to 
find something that you came there to shop for,” says one 
expert.
•
Create a site that is mobile friendly. Transactions con-
ducted from smart phones and tablets account for 21 per-
cent of online sales revenue; therefore, online merchants’ 
sites must be compatible with mobile devices. Mobile users 
quickly abandon sites that are not. Unfortunately, 93.3 per-
cent of small business Web sites are not mobile compatible 
and do not render properly on mobile devices.
•
Be social. Businesses should link their Web sites to their 
social media accounts, which can be a significant source 
of traffic to their sites. Unfortunately, 80.5 percent of small 
business Web sites lack social media widgets. Social media 
work only when a business has a social media presence and 
an audience to engage. Every page of a Web site should in-
clude appropriate social media widgets with a call to action 
such as “Like us on Facebook” or “Follow us on Twitter.” In 
addition, a Web site should allow visitors to register or log 
in via their social media accounts, saving them time. Buttons 
that allow visitors to share content with others with just one 
click encourage visitors to become brand ambassadors.
•
Build a call to action into every page. Every page should 
drive customers to take a particular action, perhaps register-
ing for a newsletter or blog updates, downloading a free 
white paper, liking your company on Facebook, or complet-
ing a purchase. Remember that if you don’t ask customers 
to take a particular action, they won’t. A call to action has 
four components:
•
The call. This is the request to the user to take a particu-
lar action.
•
The action. This is the specific action you want the user 
to take.
•
The outcome. This is what happens when the user 
takes the requested action.
•
The design. This is how your site visually represents the 
call to action to the user.
•
Make your contact information easy to find. Sometimes 
closing a sale requires answering a customer’s question 
or solving a problem. To make contacting your company 
easy, a Web site should include an e-mail address and a 
telephone number. A study by Constant Contact reports 
that only 6.3 percent of small business Web sites include a 
contact e-mail address and just over half include a phone 
number on their home pages.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
•
Use analytics to test and optimize. The key to building 
a successful Web site is continuous improvement, which 
requires entrepreneurs to have access to meaningful infor-
mation about their sites’ performance from analytics and 
conducting tests to see what works and what doesn’t.
Analytics give entrepreneurs ideas about how to improve 
their sites (and conversion rates), and tests confirm or refute 
those ideas. The simplest tests are A/B tests, which involve 
driving traffic randomly to two Web sites with only one ele-
ment that is different (the headline, graphic, call to action, 
and so on) and monitoring the results to see which one 
produces a higher conversion rate. Figure out which analyt-
ics are most important to your site’s success, monitor them, 
and conduct tests so that you can constantly improve them.

Hands On . . . How To (continued)
Every company, no matter how small, is a potential target. The forensic analysis unit of 
Verizon Communications reports that 72 percent of the successful cyberattacks they investigate 
occur in small companies with fewer than 100 employees.131 Yet a survey by Office Depot Small 
Business reports that 66 percent of small business owners are confident their data and devices are 
secure from hackers.132 The costs associated with a security breach include not only the actual
cost of the lost data and the lawsuits that inevitably result from customers but also the long-term 
impact of the lost trust customers have for a business whose security has been breached.
To minimize the likelihood of invasion by hackers, e-companies rely on several tools, includ-
ing virus detection software, intrusion detection software, and firewalls. At the most basic level
of protection is virus detection software, which scans computer drives for viruses and malware, 
nasty programs written by devious hackers and designed to harm computers and the information 
they contain. This basic protection is essential; on average, companies come into contact with
viruses and malware once every three minutes.133 The severity of viruses and malware ranges 
widely, from relatively harmless programs that put humorous messages on a user’s screen to 
those that erase a computer’s hard drive or cause the entire system to crash. Because hackers 
are always writing new viruses to attack computer systems, entrepreneurs must keep their virus 
detection software up to date and must run it often. An attack by one virus can bring a company’s
entire e-commerce platform to a screeching halt in no time!
Intrusion detection software is essential for any company doing business on the Web. 
These packages constantly monitor the activity on a company’s network server and sound an 
alert if they detect someone breaking into the company’s computer system or if they detect un-
usual network activity. Intrusion detection software not only can detect attempts by unauthorized 
users to break into a computer system while they are happening but also can trace the hacker’s 
location. Most packages also have the ability to preserve a record of the attempted break-in that 
will stand up in court so that companies can take legal action against cyberintruders. Web security 
companies such as McAfee provide software such as ScanAlert that scans a small business’s Web
site daily to certify that it is “Hacker Safe.” Online companies using the software are able to post 
a certification mark signifying that their sites are protected from unauthorized access.
A firewall is a combination of hardware and software operating between the Internet and 
a company’s computer network that allows employees to have access to the Internet but keeps 
unauthorized users from entering a company’s network and the programs and data it contains. 
Establishing a firewall is essential to operating a company on the Web, but entrepreneurs must 
make sure their firewalls are set up properly. Otherwise, they are useless! Even with all of these 
security measures in place, it is best for a company to run its Web site on a separate server from 
the network that runs the business. If hackers break into the site, they still do not have access to
the company’s sensitive data and programs.

Even though 65 percent of small businesses store customer data on their computer systems, 
only 44 percent of small companies check their virus detection software and firewalls weekly 
to ensure that they are up-to-date (and 14 percent never check them).

134 The National Cyber 
Security Alliance (http://staysafeonline.org/) Computer Security Institute (http://www.gocsi.com/) 
offer articles, information, and seminars to help business owners maintain computer security.
Information Security Magazine (which can be found at http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/) also
offers helpful advice on maintaining computer security.
In e-commerce, just as in traditional retailing, sales do not matter unless a company gets 
paid! On the Web, customers demand transactions they can complete with ease and convenience, 
and the simplest way to allow customers to pay for e-commerce transactions is with credit cards.
From a Web customer’s perspective, however, one of the most important security issues is the se-
curity of his or her credit card information. To ensure the security of their customers’ credit card 
information, online retailers typically use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt 
customers’ transaction information as it travels across the Internet. By using secure shopping 
cart features from storefront-building services or Internet service providers, even the smallest 
e-commerce stores can offer their customers secure online transactions.
Processing credit card transactions requires a company to obtain an Internet merchant ac-
count from a bank or financial intermediary. Setup fees for an Internet merchant account typi-
cally range from $500 to $1,000, but companies also pay monthly access and statement fees of 
between $40 and $80 plus a transaction fee of 10 to 60 cents per transaction. Once an online 
company has a merchant account, it can accept credit cards from online customers.
Online credit card transactions also pose a risk for merchants; online fraud cost companies
an estimated $3.5 billion a year, nearly 1 percent of their annual revenues (see Figure 9.8).135
The most common problem is charge-backs, online transactions that customers dispute. Un-
like credit card transactions in a retail store, those made online (“card-not-present” transactions) 
involve no signatures, and Internet merchants incur the loss when a customer disputes an online
credit card transaction. One way to prevent fraud is to ask customers for their card verification 
value (CVV or CVV2), the three-digit number above the signature panel on the back of the credit 
card, as well as their card number and expiration date. Online merchants also can subscribe to a

real-time credit card processing service that authorizes credit card transactions, but the fees can 
be high. Sending confirmation e-mails that include the customer’s shipping information after 
receiving an order also reduced the likelihood of a charge-back. In addition, using a shipper that 
provides the ability to track shipments enables online merchants to prove that the customer actu-
ally received the merchandise can help minimize the threat of payment fraud.
Once a company has proper security technology in place, managers must train employees 
on proper security measures because people often are the weakest link in a company’s security 
chain. Employees must create unique, secure passwords for all accounts and never reveal them 
to others. Employees must be vigilant for phishing tactics in which scammers pose as legitimate 
businesses and attempt to extract sensitive information. In addition, employees should never 
respond to sketchy e-mails (which often are the source of malware, viruses, and attacks) and 
must exercise extreme caution on social media. As social media have become more prevalent, 
attackers have shifted their focus away from e-mail attacks to cleverly disguised social media 
attacks, including fake offerings (inviting users to join a fake group and share sensitive infor-
mation), “likejacking” (using fake “like” buttons that install viruses and malware on the user’s 
computer), and other malicious techniques.136
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
E-commerce is creating a new economy, one that is 
connecting producers, sellers, and customers via tech-
nology in ways that have never been possible before. 
In this fast-paced world of e-commerce, size no longer 
matters as much as speed and flexibility do. The 
Internet is creating a new industrial order, and compa-
nies that fail to adapt to it will soon become extinct.
1. Understand the factors an entrepreneur should 
consider before launching into e-commerce.
Before launching an e-commerce effort, business own-
ers should consider the following important issues:
● How a company exploits the Web’s interconnectiv-
ity and the opportunities it creates to transform 
relationships with its suppliers and vendors, its 
customers, and other external stakeholders is crucial 
to its success.
● Web success requires a company to develop a plan
for integrating the Web into its overall strategy. The 
plan should address issues such as site design and 
maintenance, brand development and management, 
marketing and promotional strategies, sales, and 
customer service.
● Developing deep, lasting relationships with custom-
ers takes on even greater importance on the Web. 
Attracting customers on the Web costs money,
and companies must be able to retain their online 
customers to make their Web sites profitable.
● Creating a meaningful presence on the Web requires 
an ongoing investment of resources—time, money, 
energy, and talent. Establishing an attractive Web 
site brimming with catchy photographs of products 
is only the beginning.
● Measuring the success of its Web-based sales effort 
is essential to remaining relevant to customers
whose tastes, needs, and preferences are always
changing.
2. Explain the 10 myths of e-commerce and how 
to avoid falling victim to them.
Myth 1. If I launch a site, customers will flock to it.
Myth 2. Online customers are easy to please.
Myth 3. Making money on the Web is easy.
Myth 4. Privacy is not an important issue on the Web.
Myth 5. “Strategy? I don’t need a strategy to sell on the 
Web! Just give me a Web site, and the rest will take
care of itself.”
Myth 6. The most important part of any e-commerce 
effort is technology.
Myth 7. Customer service is not as important online as 
it is in a traditional retail store.
Myth 8. Flashy Web sites are better than 
simple ones.
Myth 9. It’s what’s up front that counts.
Myth 10. It’s too late to get into e-commerce.
3. Explain the basic strategies entrepreneurs 
should follow to achieve success in their 
e-commerce efforts.
Following are some guidelines for building a success-
ful Web strategy for a small e-company:
● Focus on a niche in the market.
● Develop a community of online customers.
● Attract visitors by giving away “freebies.”

CHAPTER 9 • E-COMMERCE AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
383
● Create a fast, simple checkout process.
● Provide customers multiple payment options.
● Assure customers that their online transactions are 
secure.
● Establish reasonable shipping and handling charges 
and post them up front.
● Confirm transactions.
● Keep your site updated.
● Test your site often.
● Rely on analytics to improve your site.
● Consider hiring a professional to design your site.
5. Explain how companies track the results from
their Web sites.
One option for tracking Web activity is through log-
analysis software. Server logs record every page, 
graphic, audio clip, or photograph that visitors to a site 
access, and log-analysis software analyzes these logs 
and generates reports describing how visitors behave 
when they get to a site. Key metrics for measuring the 
effectiveness of a site’s performance include cost per 
acquisition, bounce rate, cart abandonment rate, and 
conversion rate.
6. Describe how e-businesses ensure the privacy 
and security of the information they collect 
and store from the Web.
To make sure they are using the information they 
collect from visitors to their Web sites legally and ethi-
cally, companies should take the following steps:
● Take an inventory of the customer data collected.
● Develop a company privacy policy for the informa-
tion collected.
● Post the company’s privacy policy prominently on 
the Web site and follow it.
To ensure the security of the information they collect 
and store from Web transactions, companies should
rely on virus and intrusion detection software and fire-
walls to ward off attacks from hackers.
● Make creative use of e-mail but avoid becoming a 
“spammer.”
● Make sure that your Web site says “credibility.”
● Make the most of the Web’s global reach.
● Promote your Web site online and offline.
● Use social media tools to attract and retain 
customers.
● Develop an effective search engine optimization 
strategy.
4. Learn the techniques of designing a killer 
Web site.
There is no surefire formula for stopping Web shoppers
in their tracks, but the following suggestions will help:
● Understand your target customer.
● Give customers want they want.
● Select a domain name that is consistent with the 
image you want to create for your company and 
register it.
● Make your Web site easy to navigate.
● Offer suggestions for related products.
● Add wish list capability.
● Create a gift idea center.
● Provide customer ratings and reviews.
● Use online videos.
● Establish the appropriate call to action on 
each page.
● Build loyalty by giving online customers a reason to 
return to your Web site.
● Establish hyperlinks with other businesses, 
preferably those selling products or services that 
complement yours.
● Include an e-mail option and a telephone number in 
your site.
● Give shoppers the ability to track their orders online.
● Offer Web shoppers a special all their own.
● Follow a simple design for your Web page.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Setting prices is a business decision governed by both art and science—with a touch of instinct 
thrown in for good measure. Setting prices for their products and services requires entrepreneurs
to balance a multitude of complex forces, many of them working in opposite directions. Entrepre-
neurs must determine prices for their goods and services that will draw customers and produce a 
profit. Unfortunately, many small business owners set prices without enough information about 
their cost of operations and their customers. Price is an important factor in building long-term 
relationships with customers, and haphazard pricing techniques can confuse and alienate custom-
ers and endanger a small company’s profitability. Research shows that proper pricing strategies 
have far greater impact on a company’s profits than corresponding increases in unit volume and 
reductions in fixed or variable costs (see Figure 10.1).1 For instance, when a company that earns 
a 10 percent net profit margin raises its prices by just 1 percent, its profits increase by 10 percent 
(assuming that its unit sales remain the same).
Another complicating factor is a holdover from the Great Recession: Customers have be-
come more price sensitive. As sales slipped during the recession, companies resorted to deals,
discounts, and coupons to attract and keep customers. Now those companies are having difficulty 
weaning customers off of their value-oriented mindset. A recent survey of shoppers’ behavior 
by Parago reports that 75 percent of shoppers say they are more price sensitive than they were 
just 12 months before. Reflecting this sensitivity, 80 percent of shoppers now look for sales, 
deals, rebates, or lowest advertised prices at least some of the time before they buy, compared to 
69 percent the year before.2 Modern shoppers use technology such as smart phones and tablet 
PCs with price comparison apps to shop for the best deals—often right in the middle of a store’s 
aisles, and they expect consistency in prices across all of a company’s channels. In a recent sur-
vey by SDL, 62 percent of global shoppers say they use their mobile devices to compare product 
prices, research products, and look for discount coupons or sales.3 The result is a new age of price 
transparency entrepreneurs have never before experienced and an environment that makes setting
the right prices all the more important—and difficult.
Setting prices is not only one of the toughest decisions small business owners face but 
also one of the most important. Setting prices too high drives customers away and destroys a 
company’s sales. Establishing prices that are too low, a common tendency among first-time 
entrepreneurs, robs a business of its ability to generate a profit, creates the impression among 
customers that the company’s products and services are of inferior quality, and threatens 
its long-term success. Improper pricing has destroyed countless businesses whose owners
mistakenly thought that their prices were high enough to generate a profit when, in fact, they
were not.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jeff Trott: Timeless Message After working with a con-
sultant, Jeff Trott, founder of Timeless Message, a company that sells bottles with greeting
messages inside them, raised its prices from an average of $30 per bottle to $60 per bottle. The 
company had underestimated both its costs and the market value of its products. The price increase
resulted in a brief sales dip, but, according to Trott, “We started making a profit for the first time 
in four years. It was like we had been shipping a ten-dollar bill out the door with each order.”4 ■
Pricing decisions cut across every aspect of a small company, influencing everything from its 
marketing and sales efforts to its operations and strategy. Price is the monetary value of a product 
or service in the marketplace; it is a measure of what the customer must give up to obtain vari-
ous goods and services. Price also is a signal of a product’s or service’s value to an individual, 
and different customers assign different values to the same goods and services. From an entre-
preneur’s viewpoint, price must be compatible with customers’ perceptions of value. “Pricing is 
not just a math problem,” says one business writer. “It’s a psychology test.”5 The psychology of 
pricing is an art much more than it is a science. It focuses on creating value in the customer’s 
mind but recognizes that value is what the customer perceives it to be. Customers often look 
to a product’s or service’s price for clues about value. Consider the following examples, which 
illustrate the sometimes puzzling connection between price and perceived value:
● Raymond Cooke started KEF in 1961 in an old Quonset hut located on the former Kent 
Engineering and Foundry in Kent, England, to manufacture top quality speakers for audio 
systems. The company, known for its constant innovation in sound technology, recently in-
troduced its Blade speakers, whose unique curved design not only sets them apart visually 
but also makes them perfect for sound balancing and directing sound across all frequency 
ranges. Selling for $30,000 a pair, Blade speakers are the ultimate choice for audiophiles. 
One magazine recently described them as the “Best Money-No-Object Speakers.” KEF 
also made headlines when it sold a limited edition of 100 pairs of Muon speakers, which 
are six-and-a-half feet tall, at an eye-popping $200,000 per pair.6
● An audiophile who buys a set of KEF speakers might also be interested in an MT5 turn-
table from McIntosh Labs, a company founded by Frank McIntosh in Silver Springs, 
Maryland, in 1949, that made a name for itself by manufacturing some of the highest qual-
ity turntables for vinyl records, which are experiencing a comeback despite their outdated 
technology. The platter of the MT5 turntable, which retails for $6,500, is magnetically 
suspended to provide the smoothest track for the tone arm, which is set at the factory to the 
perfect height so that it produces the highest quality sound. A precision belt-drive motor 
dampens vibrations so that listeners hear only the sound of the record playing.7
● Mike Stewart left his job as chief of police at a large univer-
sity to open Wildrose Kennels, a kennel near Oxford, Missis-
sippi, that specializes in British Labrador Retrievers trained 
to be “365 dogs,” Stewart’s term for a dog that is on its best 
behavior in the field and at home playing with kids. Seven-
week-old puppies from Wildrose Kennels’s labs, which come 
in black, chocolate, yellow, and fox red (a darker shade of yel-
low), sell for $1,750 to $2,000. An older, “finished” dog that 
is two to three years old goes for up to $15,000. Despite the 
lofty prices, Stewart has a one-year waiting list for his labs.8
As you can see, setting higher prices sometimes can increase
the appeal of a product or service (“If you charge more, you must be 
worth it”). Value for these products is found not solely in their su-
perior technical performance but also in their scarcity and unique-
ness and the resulting image they create for the buyer. Although 
entrepreneurs must recognize the shallow depth of the market for 
ultraluxury items such as these, the ego-satisfying ownership of 
limited-edition watches, pens, cars, jewelry, and other items is the
psychological force supporting a premium price strategy.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Three Potent Forces: Image, Competition, and Value
Because pricing decisions have such a pervasive influence on all aspects of a small company, one 
of the most important considerations for entrepreneurs is to take a strategic rather than a piece-
meal approach to pricing their companies’ products and services. Research by the University of 
Pennsylvania’s Wharton School shows that companies that take a strategic approach to pricing 
and monitor its results can raise their sales revenue between 1 and 8 percent. After analyzing its 
existing pricing techniques using price management software, New York City drugstore chain 
Duane Reade discovered that parents of newborns are less price sensitive than are parents of 
toddlers. Managers decided to make diaper pricing a function of the child’s age, cutting prices to 
meet those of competitors on toddlers’ diapers and raising them on diapers for newborns. A year 
later, the company’s new pricing strategy had produced a 27 percent increase in its baby care 
revenue.9
A company’s pricing strategy is a major determinant of its image in the marketplace, is in-
fluenced by the pricing strategies of its competitors, and is an important element in the value that 
customers perceive its products or services provide.
Price Conveys Image
A company’s pricing policies communicate important information about its overall image to 
customers. Pricing sends an important signal to customers about a company, its brand, its posi-
tion in the market, the quality of its products and services, the image it wants to create, and other 
important concepts. For example, the prices charged by a posh men’s clothing shop reflect a com-
pletely different image from those charged by a factory outlet store. Because most people have
difficulty judging the quality of many products and services, they typically associate high prices 
with quality, prestige, and exclusivity. Accordingly, when developing a marketing approach to 
pricing, entrepreneurs must establish prices that are compatible with what customers expect and
are willing to pay. Too often, entrepreneurs underprice their goods and services, believing that 
low prices are the only way they can achieve a competitive advantage.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Neil Blumenthal, David 
Gilboa, Andrew Hunt, and Jeffrey Raider: Warby
Parker While studying at the Wharton School of Business at the 
University of Pennsylvania, Neil Blumenthal, David Gilboa, Andrew 
Hunt, and Jeffrey Raider discovered that they all preferred de-
signer eyeglasses but were put off by the $500 prices they paid for
them. They began researching the eyeglasses industry and found 
that it was dominated by a few giant companies and that the 
typical pair of glasses carried a markup of 20 times its cost. They 
were amazed because the material used to manufacture eye-
glasses (mainly plastic and metal) is inexpensive. They also real-
ized that although eyeglasses were invented several hundred 
years ago, the industry had experienced very little product inno-
vation and almost none in distribution. The young entrepreneurs 
decided to change that, pitched in $120,000 of their own money,
and launched Warby Parker, an online retailer of vintage-inspired 
eyeglasses that their original business plan said would design and
sell prescription glasses and sunglasses priced at $500 elsewhere 
for just $45. Their marketing professor told them that their idea would not work, pointing out
that their price was less than 10 percent of those of competitors. He explained that such a low 
price would lead potential customers to assume that Warby Parker’s products were of poor qual-
ity. Their professor also suggested that the actual cost of producing the glasses would be higher 
than they had anticipated (he was right; their actual cost of goods sold was almost double what 
they had projected) and that a low price offered them such a small profit margin that any mistake
could cause their business to collapse. Early market research confirmed that customers did not 
trust prices that are outside the normal range (even on the low side). In the end, the entrepre-
neurs decided to sell their eyeglasses at $95. Their pricing strategy worked; Warby Parker hit its
entire first year sales target just three weeks after it launched. The company has outgrown its 
office space numerous times and has raised more than $116 million in financing to fuel its contin-
ued growth.10 ■
Many entrepreneurs make the common pricing mistake of failing to recognize the extra 
value, convenience, service, and quality they give their customers—all things that many custom-
ers are willing to pay for. These companies fall into the trap of trying to compete solely on the 
basis of price when they lack the sales volume—and, hence, the lower cost structures—of their 
larger rivals. It is a recipe for failure. “People want quality,” says one merchant selling upscale 
goods at upscale prices. “They want value. But if you lower prices, they think that you are low-
ering the value and lowering the quality.”11 It is a dangerous cycle that can destroy a business. 
A study of businesses in multiple industries by Rafi Mohammed, author of The Art of Pricing,
found that those companies that raised prices by 1 percent saw their profits increase 11 percent. 
Those that raised their prices by 10 percent realized profit increases of 100 percent!12 The study 
does not imply that businesses have free rein to raise prices to any level, but it does suggest that 
many companies can raise their prices enough to improve their financial results significantly as
long as they convince customers that their products or services offer superior value. One expert 
explains the relationship between value and price with the following conceptual equation:
(S + P)/D > $ + E
where
S = Company’s standards of doing business
P = Product or service quality and performance
D = Doubt in customers’ minds that detract from the value of the company’s standards and products 
or services
$ = Product or service price
E = Customers’ expectations of a company and its products and services
According to this equation, the value customers gain from doing business with a com-
pany and buying its products or services (after being diminished by doubts they have about the

company and its products or services) must exceed the price they pay and the expectations they 
have about the company and its products or services.13 When guests visit one of the Walt Disney
theme parks, all cast members (Disney-speak for employees) know they must measure up to
some of the highest expectations of any business in any industry. (After all, the guests are on 
vacation, and everything should be perfect.) Ticket prices are not cheap (one-day tickets start at 
about $100 with discounts for multi-day tickets), but Disney cast members are highly trained in 
the art of providing stellar customer service and understand the central role that it plays in the 
company’s culture. Cast members also have the freedom to make decisions on the spot to fix 
any problems that guests may encounter and always strive not only to meet but also to exceed 
customers’ expectations.
A key ingredient to setting prices properly is to understand a company’s target market: the 
customer groups at which the small company is aiming its goods or services. Rather than ask 
“How much should I charge for my product or service?” entrepreneurs should ask “How much
are my target customers willing to pay?” Target market, business image, and pricing strategy are 
closely related. For example, final prices on T-shirts made in the same factories in Bangladesh 
for discount retailers and for high-end designer labels often have little connection to their costs 
but reflect the image the retailer has created for itself. The retail price of a T-shirt made in a 
Bangladesh factory at Wal-Mart’s Asda chain in London is about $6.50. A T-shirt, also made in 
a Bangladesh factory, from designer brand G-Star Raw sells for $98.50, fifteen times more than
the Wal-Mart version. Luxury retailers often choose higher-quality fabrics and include small
embellishments such as pockets or contrasting piping on seams that add to their costs, but their 
final prices are more closely related to reinforcing the brands’ image than to recovering costs.
The manufacturing cost of a basic T-shirt in Bangladesh is about $1.60 to $2.00; the cost of 
making a typical designer label T-shirt ranges from $5 to $6. In addition to the additional produc-
tion costs designer labels incur, their retail prices must cover their higher business costs, such 
as advertising, rent on boutique shops, and salaries for salespeople.14 For many of the products 
upscale brands sell, their final prices are more a reflection of their desired image than the reality 
of their costs.
Competition and Prices
Competitors’ prices can have a dramatic impact on a small company’s sales. Today, small com-
panies face competition from local businesses as well as from online businesses that may be 
many time zones away. Price transparency due to the Internet, the ease of mobile shopping, and 
customers’ persistent post-recession price sensitivity impose constraints on companies’ ability to 
raise prices (see Figure 10.2). About 60 percent of shoppers in North America report using their 
mobile devices regularly in stores to research prices on items that sell for $100 or more.15 When 
setting prices, entrepreneurs must take into account their competitors’ prices, but the decision to 
match or beat them is not automatic. A company’s pricing policies involve more than covering
t
expenses and generating a profit; they also tell an important story about its position in the market-
place and the extra value it offers customers. However, unless a small company can differentiate 
itself by creating a distinctive image in customers’ minds or by offering superior service, quality, 
design, convenience, or speed, it must match its competitors’ prices or risk losing sales. Before
matching any competitor’s prices, however, small business owners should consider a rival’s mo-
tives. A competitor may establish its price structure on the basis of a unique set of criteria and a 
totally different strategy. Blindly matching competitors’ prices can lead a company to financial 
ruin, and companies that set their prices this way typically do so because they perceive them-
selves in a position of strategic weakness. Recall from Chapter 5 that companies that execute a
t
successful differentiation strategy can charge prices higher than those of their competitors.
The similarity of competitors’ goods and services also influences a company’s pricing poli-
cies. Entrepreneurs must monitor competitors’ prices on products that are identical to or that are 
close substitutes for those they sell and strive to keep their prices in line with them.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Apple Inc. Apple Inc., long known for its premium pricing 
strategy, recently introduced a lower priced iPhone, which is the company’s leading reve-
nue driver, in an effort to fend off intense competition from low-cost phones from Samsung, HTC, 
Nokia, LG, and other rivals. Traditionally, phones priced below $300 have generated only 2 percent 

CHAPTER 10 • PRICING AND CREDIT STRATEGIES
391
of Apple’s smart phone sales, compared to an average of 70 percent for its top rivals. The move 
was designed to reverse the company’s declining market share in the smart phone market and to 
introduce new customers, particularly those in foreign markets, to its products. Apple lowered the 
cost of the iPhone model by using a plastic case (rather than the aluminum cases on its high-end
phones) and incorporating proven hardware from previous generation phones. Introducing a
lower-priced phone was essential to Apple’s global strategy, especially in China, which is its 
fastest-growing market and accounts for 15 percent of its sales. Lower-priced phones from 
Samsung, Lenovo, Yulong, and Huawei have pushed Apple into fifth place in the Chinese market. 
Introducing the lower-priced model enabled Apple to strike a deal with China’s largest mobile 
carrier with more than 760 million customers, China Mobile, to distribute Apple products.16 ■
Generally, entrepreneurs should avoid head-to-head price competition with other firms that 
can more easily achieve lower prices through lower cost structures. For instance, most locally 
owned drugstores cannot compete with the prices of large national drug chains that buy in large 
quantities and negotiate significant discounts. However, many local drugstores operate success-
fully by using nonprice competition; these stores offer more personalized service, free delivery, 
credit sales, and other extras that the chains have eliminated. Nonprice competition can be an 
effective strategy for a small business in the face of larger, more powerful companies because 
experimenting with price changes can be dangerous for small companies. Price changes cause 
fluctuations in sales volume that a small company may not be able to tolerate. In addition, fre-
quent price changes may muddle a company’s image and damage customer relations.
Recall from Chapter 5 that if a business chooses to offer lower prices than competitors, it 
t
must first create a low cost advantage; otherwise, the strategy is unsustainable. An entrepreneur 
can create a low-cost advantage by:
● choosing a low-cost location.
● minimizing operating costs by maximizing efficiency.
● exercising tight control over inventory and restricting product lines to those items that turn 
over quickly.
● providing customers with no or limited service (e.g., self-service).
● using low-cost, bootstrap marketing techniques.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
● selling basic products but offering customers the option of purchasing additional product or 
service features that generate higher profit margins.
● achieving high sales volume that allows the business to spread its fixed costs across a large
number of units. Stuart Wetanson, fourth generation manager of Dallas BBQ, a chain with 
10 locations in New York City that is known for its low-priced, high-quality barbecue, un-
derstands that high volume is the key to the company’s success, especially given the high 
costs of its locations. For instance, the company’s restaurant in Times Square, which fea-
tures some of the highest lease rates in the city, can seat 780 people at a time, but on busy
nights employees manage to serve 10,000 meals, including catering, takeout, and delivery 
orders. Dallas BBQ locations are open from 11 a.m. to as late as 1:30 a.m. and offer a sim-
ple menu with no desserts, which increases the number of “turns” the restaurants generate 
each day.17
Attempting to undercut competitors’ prices is a dangerous strategy, how-
ever, and may lead to a price war, one of the deadliest games a small busi-
ness can play. No business wins a race to the bottom. Price wars can eradicate 
companies’ profit margins and scar an entire industry for years. “Many entre-
preneurs cut prices to the point of unprofitability just to compete,” says one
business writer. “In doing so, they open the door to catastrophe. Less revenue 
often translates into lower quality, poorer service, sloppier salesmanship, 
weaker customer loyalty, and financial disaster.”18 Price wars usually begin 
when one competitor thinks that he or she can achieve higher volume and take 
market share from rivals instantaneously by lowering prices. Rather than stick-
ing to their strategic guns, competitors believe they must follow suit. Once a 
highly profitable segment, the market for consumer electronics has become the 
stage for a price war as retail sales stagnated and frugal customers focused on 
getting the lowest prices. In attempt to wrest market share from big box com-
petitors Best Buy, Staples, Target, and others, Wal-Mart announced significant 
price cuts on electronics, including televisions, tablets, videogame consoles,
and other devices, heading into the busy holiday season, which for many re-
tailers accounts for as much as 40 percent of their annual sales. The price cuts 
started a price war that caused the profits of large and small electronics retail-
ers to decline during a critical time of the year as competitors cut prices in 
an attempt to attract customers and hold on to their market share. One expert 
likens a price war to competitors holding guns to each other’s heads.19
Entrepreneurs usually overestimate the power of price cuts. In reality, sales 
volume rarely increases enough to offset the lower profit margins of a lower 
price. A business with a 25 percent gross profit margin that cuts its price by
10 percent would have to triple its sales volume just to break even.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Steve Richardson: Stave Puzzles When a severe reces-
sion caused sales during the crucial holiday season to slow, Steve Richardson, owner of
Stave Puzzles, a maker of hand-crafted wooden jigsaw puzzles based in Norwich, Connecticut, 
resorted to heavy price cuts to stimulate sales. Looking back, Richardson says the 15 percent dis-
count ran contrary to the company’s reputation for superior quality and service and was not suc-
cessful in generating enough traffic to offset the price cuts. Richardson says the stagnant economy
frightened him and his management team into cutting prices, but he believes Staves could have 
earned a profit for the year had he held prices steady or even raised them.20 ■
As Steve Richardson learned, a company may cut its prices so severely that it is impossible 
to achieve the volume necessary to offset the lower profit margins. Discounts also threaten to 
cheapen a company’s image for providing quality products and services. Even when price cuts 
work, their effects often are temporary. Customers lured by the lowest price usually exhibit little 
loyalty to a business. Rather than join in a price war by cutting prices, entrepreneurs can adjust 
their product and service offerings to appeal to different market segments: offering lower-priced
items that use less expensive materials and offer fewer extras for price-sensitive customers and 
higher-quality, premium products for those who care less about price and more about quality and

service. The lesson: the best way to survive a price war is to stay out of it by differentiating your 
company, emphasizing the unique features, benefits, and value it offer customers!
Focus on Value
Ultimately, the “right” price for a product or service depends on one factor: the value it provides 
for a customer. There are two aspects of value, however. Entrepreneurs may recognize the objective
value of their products and services, which is the price customers would be willing to pay if they un-
derstood perfectly the benefits that a product or service delivers for them. Unfortunately, few if any
customers can see a product’s or a service’s true objective value; instead, they see only its perceived
value, which determines the price they are willing to pay for it. Research into purchasing decisions 
has revealed a fundamental problem that adds to the complexity of a business owner’s pricing de-
cision: People faced with pricing decisions often act irrationally. In one classic study, researchers 
asked shoppers whether they would travel an additional 20 minutes to save $5 on a calculator that 
costs $15; most said they would. When asked the same question about a $125 jacket, most of the 
shoppers said no, even though they would be saving the exact same amount of money!21
“Value” does not necessarily equate to low price, however. Businesses that underprice their 
products and services or constantly run special discount price promotions may be short-circuiting 
the value proposition they are trying to build and communicate to their customers. Norm Brodsky,
owner of CitiStorage, a document storage company in New York City, says setting prices too low 
is more dangerous than setting them too high. The veteran entrepreneur reminds business owners 
that they can always lower their prices if they initially set them too high. Raising prices that are 
too low is much more difficult and can create the wrong image for a business.22
Customers may respond to price cuts, but companies that rely on them to boost sales risk 
undermining the perceived value of their products and services. In addition, once customers 
grow accustomed to buying products and services during special promotions, the habit can be 
difficult to break. They simply wait for the next sale. The results are extreme swings in sales 
and diminished value of the brand. In some economic and competitive conditions, however, 
companies have little choice but to offer lower-priced products. Techniques that companies can 
use to increase customers’ perception of value and, essentially lower their prices with less risk 
of diminishing their brands, include offering coupons and rebates that are not as closely con-
nected to the product as direct price cuts. Limited-time-only discounts (more on these later in 
this chapter) used sparingly also increase short-term sales without causing long-term damage 
to a brand. Another strategy that some companies have used successfully is to launch a “fighter 
brand,” a less expensive, no-frills version of a company’s flagship product that is designed to 
confront lower-priced competitors head-on, satisfy the appetites of value-conscious customers, 
and preserve the image of the company’s premium product. Rather than lower the price of its 
Pentium computer chip, Intel introduced the lower-cost Celeron chip to stave off rival AMD’s 
line of value-priced chips.
One of the most important determinants of customers’ response to a price is whether they 
perceive the price to be a fair exchange for the value they receive from the product or service.
The good news is that, through marketing and other efforts, companies can influence customers’ 
perception of value. Because price is one part of a product’s or a service’s features, it is another 
way a company can communicate value to its customers. For most shoppers, three reference 
points define a fair price: the price they have paid for the product or service in the past, the prices
competitors charge for the same or similar product or service, and the costs a company incurs to 
provide the product or service. The price customers have paid in the past for an item serves as a 
baseline reference point, but people often forget that inflation causes a company’s costs to rise 
from year to year. Therefore, it is important for business owners to remind customers periodically
that they must raise prices to offset the increased cost of doing business. Norm Brodsky, owner 
of the successful document storage company, points out that a business’s operating costs go up 
over time and that customers respond better to small price increases over time rather than big, 
periodic increases.23 In addition, customers are less likely to notice small, regular price increases 
that result from rising costs than a single, steep price increase that could send them running to 
competitors. In the face of rising food costs and a sluggish economy, McDonald’s, the largest 
restaurant chain in the world, has relied on small, consistent price increases to maintain its profit 
margins without alienating customers.24

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
As we have seen already, companies often find it necessary to match competitors’ prices 
on the same or similar items unless they can establish a distinctive image in customers’ minds. 
One of the most successful strategies for companies facing direct competition is to differen-
tiate their products or services by adding value for customers and then charging for it. For 
instance, a company might offer faster delivery, a longer product warranty, extra service, or 
something else that adds value to an item for its customers and allows the business to charge
a higher price.
Perhaps the least understood of the three reference points is a company’s cost structure. Cus-
tomers often underestimate the costs businesses incur to provide products and services, whether 
it is a simple cotton T-shirt on a shelf in a beachfront shop or a lifesaving drug that may have cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars and many years to develop. For instance, in a study on pricing 
conducted by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, shoppers estimated the aver-
age grocery store’s net profit margin to be 27 percent when, in reality, it is less than 2 percent.25
Customers forget that business owners must make or buy the products they sell, market them,
pay their employees, and cover a host of other operating expenses, ranging from health care to 
legal fees. Because customers understand so little about a company’s cost of producing a product 
or providing a service, entrepreneurs should focus on setting prices that communicate value to 
customers and create the desired image for the company.
One of the biggest mistakes an entrepreneur can make is underestimating the company’s 
actual total cost of a product or service. Calculating the unit cost of a producing a product or 
providing a service is just the starting point. Entrepreneurs also must calculate the total cost of the 
product or service, which includes shipping, labor (wages, salaries, and benefits), and overhead 
costs (marketing, insurance, rent, utilities, and many others). When setting prices, some entre-
preneurs think strictly in terms of product or service costs and fail to consider the total cost of 
providing the product or service. The result is a price that fails to cover the product’s or service’s 
total cost and a company that is never able to produce a profit.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Joshua Henderson: Skillet Street Food Joshua Henderson 
was a pioneer in the gourmet food truck industry when he launched Skillet Street Food in 
Seattle, Washington, from a converted Airstream trailer. Because there was no model to follow, 
Henderson says he had to figure out on his own, often using trial and error, how to price his menu
offerings. Getting Skillet’s prices right took some time, but Henderson eventually found a sweet
spot below the prices of brick-and-mortar restaurants but high enough to cover food costs and 
generate sustainable profit margins. For instance, the original price of Skillet’s popular burger and
poutine (hand-cut fries covered in cheese and gravy) was $15, but Henderson realized that the
company was not making money at that price. Raising the price to $17 produced a profit margin
that was in line with the typical restaurant without alienating customers. Skillet Street Food now 
generates $2 million in annual sales.26 ■
Entrepreneurs often find themselves squeezed by rising operating and raw material costs but 
are hesitant to raise prices because they fear losing customers. Businesses facing rapidly rising
costs in their businesses should consider the following strategies:
● Communicate with customers. Let your customers know why you have to raise prices. 
Danny O’Neill, owner of The Roasterie, a wholesale coffee business that sells to upscale 
restaurants, coffeehouses, and supermarkets, operates in a market in which the cost of raw
material and supplies can fluctuate wildly because of forces beyond his control. When 
coffee prices nearly doubled in just three months, O’Neill was able to pass along the rising 
costs of his company’s raw material to customers without losing a single one. He sent his
customers a six-page letter and copies of newspaper articles about the increases in coffee 
prices. The approach gave the Roasterie credibility and helped show customers that the
necessary price increases were beyond his control.27
● Rather than raise the price of the good or service, include a surcharge. Price increases
tend to be permanent, but if higher costs are the result of a particular event (e.g., a 
hurricane that disrupted the nation’s ability to process oil and resulted in rapidly rising 
fuel costs), a company can include a temporary surcharge. If the pressure on its costs 
subsides, the company can eliminate the surcharge. When fuel prices began climbing 

CHAPTER 10 • PRICING AND CREDIT STRATEGIES
395
rapidly, Mark Bergland, owner of Washington Floral Service, a flower wholesaler in 
Tacoma, Washington, added to each customer’s order a surcharge tied to the average 
diesel fuel price.28
● Eliminate customer discounts, coupons, and promotions. Eliminating discounts, cou-
pons, and other freebies is an invisible way of raising prices that can add significantly to a 
small company’s profit margin. Entrepreneurs must exercise care, however, because price-
conscious shoppers pay more attention to discounts, coupons, and promotions since the 
Great Recession. One bookstore chain restructured its generous discount program because 
it had begun to cut too deeply into the company’s profitability. Loyal customers still earn 
discounts (as do loyal customers at its competitors), but the discounts are smaller and 
expire faster.29
● Offer products in smaller sizes or quantities. As food costs have soared, many restau-
rants have introduced “small plates,” reduced-portion items that enabled them to keep 
their prices in check. In the quick-service sector, slider-style miniburgers billed as “fun 
food” and offered in bundles have become a popular item on many menus. Buffalo Wild 
Wings, a chain that specializes in chicken wings, recently saw the cost of wings increase
70 percent in just one year. To cope with the substantial increase in its costs, the company
changed the way it sells wings. Buffalo Wild Wings sells wings by portion size—snack, 
small, medium, and large—rather than by count, giving the company more flexibility over 
its pricing and greater control over its costs. The chain also began promoting its fresh, 
never-frozen wings as a premium product. The changes enabled Buffalo Wild Wings to 
regain control of its cost of goods sold and preserve its profit margins without experienc-
ing a decline in sales.30
● Focus on improving efficiency everywhere in the company. Although raw materials costs 
may be beyond a business owner’s control, other costs within the company are not. One 
way to cope with the effects of a rapid increase in costs is to find ways to cut costs and to
improve efficiency in other areas. These improvements may not totally offset higher raw 
materials costs, but they can dampen their impact. Blain Supply, founded in 1955 by brothers 
Claude and Bert Blain in Janesville, Wisconsin, operates 35 discount stores that sell every-
thing from clothing and kitchen appliances to camping gear and tires in Illinois, Iowa, and 
Wisconsin. To keep its prices low, Blain Supply, now in its second generation of family 
ownership (with a third generation in training), participated in Wisconsin’s Retail Energy 
Management Challenge, a program that helps companies manage and reduce their energy 
consumption. Using energy audits and simple energy conservation measures, the company
generated savings of $156,000 in just one year.31
● Emphasize the value your company provides to customers. Unless a company reminds 
them, customers can forget the benefits and value its products offer. Entrepreneurs must 
recognize that providing exceptional value to their customers insulates their businesses 
from the negative impact of necessary price increases.
● Raise prices incrementally and consistently rather than rely on large periodic increases. 
Companies that do so are less likely to experience resistance due to customers’ sticker 
shock.
● Shift to less expensive raw materials if possible. Some small businesses combat rising 
raw materials cost by adding to their lines new products that cost less. When seafood and
beef prices increased, many restaurants revamped their menus to include dishes with less
expensive ingredients, such as chicken. After watching beef prices increase significantly, 
McDonald’s added new chicken-based sandwich, wrap, salad, and nugget selections to its 
menu to control costs and shore up profit margins.32
● Anticipate rising materials costs and try to lock in prices early. It pays to keep tabs on 
raw materials prices and be able to predict cycles of inflation. Entrepreneurs who can anti-
cipate rising prices may be able to make purchases early or lock in long-term contracts be-
fore prices take off. Starbucks uses this strategy successfully to lock in coffee bean prices 

396
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
with suppliers, thus insulating the company from the risk of price increases that slammed 
many of its competitors when coffee bean prices hit a 13-year high.33
● Consider absorbing cost increases. When Norm Brodsky, owner of the document storage 
company mentioned earlier, saw his competitors add a fuel surcharge to their customers’ 
bills to offset steep increases in gas prices, he decided not to add a fuel surcharge. Then
t
he used the pricing decision to attract new accounts, telling them that his company had 
discovered other ways besides imposing a surcharge to deal with rising costs and assuring
them that when the company says its contract price is fixed for a set time, customers can 
count on it. Brodsky also used the fuel surcharge issue to build loyalty among his existing 
customers, something he is certain will pay off in the future.34
● Modify the product or service to lower its cost. Taco Bell introduced the first “value 
menu” in 1988 with items priced at just 59 cents, and Wendy’s, Burger King, McDonald’s, 
and other quick-service restaurants soon followed suit. Price-sensitive customers re-
sponded, and value menu items now account for 10 to 15 percent of quick-service restau-
rants’ sales. However, rapidly rising food and energy costs have squeezed or eliminated 
franchisees’ profits on these items, forcing chains to modify the items by eliminating a 
slice of cheese (which saves six cents) or switching to a sandwich with a single beef patty
rather than two to maintain the $1 price.35 Companies using this strategy must exercise
caution, taking care not to reduce the quality of their products and services so much that 
they damage their reputations. Rather than run that risk, McDonald’s introduced its Dollar 
Menu and More, which includes 15 items priced between $1 and $5, giving the company’s 
franchisees more price flexibility and allowing them to preserve their profit margins. Fast-
food competitors, including Burger King and Taco Bell, followed suit, adjusting prices on 
their value menus.36
● Differentiate your company and its products and services from the competition. When 
customers perceive a company’s products and services to be superior to those of competi-
tors, they are less sensitive to price increases.
Setting prices with an emphasis on value is more important than trying to choose the ideal 
price for a product. In fact, for most products, there is an acceptable price range, not a single
ideal price. This price range is the area between the price ceiling defined by customers in the 
market and the price floor established by the company’s cost structure. An entrepreneur’s goal 
is to position the company’s prices within this acceptable price range. The final price business 
owners set depends on the desired image they want to create for the business in their customers’ 
minds—discount, middle of the road, or prestige (see Figure 10.3).

Pricing Strategies and Tactics
There is no limit to the number of variations in pricing strategies and tactics. This wide variety of 
options is exactly what allows entrepreneurs to be so creative. This section examines some of the 
more commonly used tactics. Pricing always plays a critical role in a firm’s overall strategy; pric-
ing policies must be compatible with a company’s total marketing plan and the image it intends 
to create in the marketplace.
Introducing a New Product
Most entrepreneurs approach setting the price of a new product with a great deal of apprehension 
because they have no precedent on which to base their decisions. If the new product’s price is 
excessively high, it is in danger of failing because of low sales volume. However, if its price is 
too low, the product’s sales revenue might not cover costs. In addition, the company runs the risk 
of establishing the product’s value at a low level. Management consulting firm McKinsey and
Company claims that 80 to 90 percent of the pricing problems on new products are the result of 
companies setting prices that are too low.37 When pricing any new product, the owner should try 
to satisfy three objectives:
1. Get the product accepted. No matter how unusual a product is, its price must be accept-
able to a company’s potential customers. The acceptable price range for a new product 
depends, in part, on the product’s position:
● Revolutionary products are so new and unique that they transform existing markets. 
The acceptable price range for revolutionary products tends to be rather wide, but the 
businesses introducing them must be prepared to make an investment in educating cus-
tomers about them.
● Evolutionary products offer upgrades and enhancements to existing products. The 
acceptable price range for evolutionary products is not as wide as it is for revolutionary 
products. Companies that introduce evolutionary products with many new features at 
prices that are too low may initiate a price war.
● Me-too products, as the name suggests, offer the same basic features as existing prod-
ucts on the market. The acceptable price range for these products is quite narrow, and
many companies introducing them find themselves left with me-too pricing strategies 
that are the same or similar to those of their competitors.
2. Maintain market share as competition grows. If a new product is successful, competitors 
will enter the market, and the small company must work to expand or at least maintain its 
market share. Continuously reappraising the product’s price in conjunction with special 
advertising and promotion techniques helps to retain market share.
3. Earn a profit. A small business must establish a price for a new product that is higher 
than its total cost. Entrepreneurs should not introduce a new product at a price below cost 
because it is much easier to lower a price than to increase it once the product is on the mar-
ket. Pricing their products too low is a common and often fatal mistake for new businesses; 
entrepreneurs are tempted to underprice their products and services when they enter a new 
market to ensure their acceptance or to gain market share quickly. Doing so, however, sets
customers’ value expectations at low levels as well, and that can be a difficult perception to 
overcome. Steve McKee, president of McKee Wallwork Cleveland Advertising, an adver-
tising agency that targets small companies, says, “It can be odd to feel good about losing 
customers because of price, but if you’re not, you may be backing yourself into a low-
margin corner. Don’t kid yourself; other than Wal-Mart, very few companies can sustain a 
low-price position.”38
Entrepreneurs have three basic strategies to choose from when establishing a new product’s 
price: penetration, skimming, and life cycle pricing.
PENETRATION If a small business introduces a product into a highly competitive market in which
a large number of similar products are competing for acceptance, the product must penetrate
the market to be successful. To gain quick acceptance and extensive distribution in the mass

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
To increase sales of a particular product or service, business own-
ers often resort to lowering its price. After all, doing so is consis-
tent with the law of demand, which says that as price decreases, 
quantity demanded increases. However, there are exceptions to 
every rule, including the law of demand. A product’s or a service’s 
price tag says a great deal about it. Shoppers often have difficulty
judging the quality of the goods and services they purchase and 
look to their prices for clues. Mike Faith, CEO of Headsets.com, 
an online company that sells a variety of wireless, Bluetooth, and 
corded headsets, involuntarily conducted an interesting pricing 
study a few years ago when a computer error caused all of the
company’s products to be listed at cost rather than their normal
retail prices for an entire weekend. Headset sales did not soar de-
spite the price decrease. Faith says that the incident taught him a
valuable lesson: The prices his company charges are less important
to his target customers than the stellar customer service it offers. 
Since the incident, Faith has raised prices only once, by 8 percent, 
and saw the company’s sales increase by 8 percent.
The prices entrepreneurs set for the products and services 
they sell are a significant factor in the image they create for their 
companies in their customers’ minds, whether that image is one 
of a discount store or one of an upscale, exclusive shop. The pric-
ing decisions entrepreneurs make influence the image and ulti-
mately the success of their companies. Hil Davis, cofounder of
J. Hilburn, the largest seller of men’s custom shirts in the world,
uses a direct sales model that involves 2,250 sales representatives. 
After reading a book by Doris Christopher, the founder of The 
Pampered Chef, another company that uses a direct sales model, 
Davis began looking for an industry that he could revolutionize by 
selling directly to consumers, a business model he believed would
enable him to incur lower costs and sell at lower prices. He be-
lieved the best opportunities were in luxury products in which cus-
tomers expected high levels of service. A short time later, Davis’s
wife, Holly, mentioned that because his favorite shirts were his 
custom-made shirts, he should buy more of them. Davis declined, 
pointing out that they cost $250 each—and that’s when Davis re-
alized this was the business opportunity he had been seeking. His 
company would sell custom-shirts directly to upscale customers at
prices below those of competing companies.
After much trial-and-error, Davis found mills that could pro-
vide high-end fabrics and a factory that could produce quality 
custom shirts in a timely manner. In fact, the mills that J. Hilburn 
purchases its fabrics from are the same ones that its competitors,
who charge much higher prices, buy from. Because J. Hilburn
purchases in smaller quantities and specific sizes that result in
more wasted fabric, it pays about 36 percent more per yard of
fabric than its larger rivals. J. Hilburn also incurs higher shipping
costs because it ships shirts from the factory to customers by air,
whereas competing fashion brands ship by sea, which cost less 
but is much slower. However, by eliminating the markups for 
wholesalers and retailers, the company can offer top-quality shirts
at lower prices. The typical wholesale markup is 2.5 to 3 times 
the cost of the shirt; the typical retail markup is 2.5 to 3 times the
wholesale price. In other words, a shirt that cost $43 to make ends 
up retailing from $295 to $395.
At J. Hilburn, a similar shirt cost about $60 to manufacture. 
The sales representative, who takes a customer’s measurements
and records his preferences for details such as collar style, cuffs, 
stitching, buttons and others, earns an average commission of
about $28. Other sales representatives also earn a share of the
sale, which amounts to about $16. A sales incentive program 
costs the company about $5 per shirt, and the company’s profit 
margin is about $31, making the average final price for a custom-
made shirt about $140. Depending on the type of fabric used, 
J. Hilburn shirts sell at prices that range from $99 to $169. Sales 
are growing rapidly, and the company has branched out into 
ties, ready-to-wear casual clothing, accessories, outerwear, and 
formalwear.
What steps can entrepreneurs take when it comes to setting 
the right prices? The following tips will help:
•
Know the costs, including the direct and the indirect costs, 
of providing your product or service.
•
Don’t set your price below your costs. “We lose money on 
every unit we sell, but we make up for it in volume” is a 
business philosophy that never works.
r
•
Price increases are easier to accomplish when a company 
faces fewer competitors. The more intense the competition, 
the more difficult it is to raise prices.
•
If you need to raise prices shortly after launching your busi-
ness, try to soften the blow by bundling products and ser-
vices to create more value for customers.
•
As your costs rise (and they will), adjust your prices in small 
amounts rather than risk making large, infrequent price 
increases that may create “sticker shock” among your 
customers.
•
Assign someone in your company to track competitors’ 
prices regularly (at least monthly) and to present the results 
on a timely basis.
•
Do not simply follow your competitors’ pricing strategies.
•
Base your pricing on the value your product or service offers
customers. Remember that sometimes the most valuable 
components of a product or service are intangible.
•
Define the image you want to create for your business and 
use your pricing strategy to communicate that image to 
your customers and to position your company in the mar-
ket. At Five Guys Burgers and Fries, a hamburger, French 
fries, and a drink cost, on average, $11.76, a good deal 
higher than the same bundle cost at a typical fast-food 
restaurant, but customers do not seem to notice. Why? Be-
cause Five Guys’ value proposition is quality and freshness, 
not low price.

market, some entrepreneurs introduce the product at a low price. They set the price just above 
total unit cost to develop a wedge in the market and quickly achieve a high volume of sales. 
Jeff Bezos, found of Amazon, has used a penetration pricing strategy to introduce each version 
of the company’s Kindle Fire tablet. Bezos says two principles guide Amazon’s pricing on its
tablets: (1) offer premium products at non-premium prices, and (2) make money when people use
Amazon devices rather than when they buy them. When Amazon introduced its 8.9-inch Kindle 
Fire HDX tablet, the retailer set the price at $230, but analysts estimate that the tablet actually
cost $227 to make ($218 for the components and $9 for a contract manufacturer to assemble 
them). Amazon priced the Kindle Fire HDX to undercut the iPad Mini, which started at $330, 
with the goal of generating a profit on the sale of books, apps, and movies for the Fire—and 
eventually on the tablet itself as the cost of the chips that serve as the device’s “brain” declined.
Amazon’s penetration pricing strategy works; its Kindle Fire tablets are now the second-best 
selling tablets on the market, although it trails Apple’s iPads by a significant amount. In addition, 
shoppers who own a Kindle tablet spend an average of $1,223 annually on Amazon products 
compared to an average of $790 annually for shoppers who do not own a Kindle.39
A penetration pricing strategy is ideal for introducing relatively low-priced goods into a market 
where no elite segment and little opportunity for differentiation exists. The introduction is usually 
accompanied by heavy advertising and promotional techniques, special sales, and discounts. This 
strategy works best when customers’ “switching cost” (the cost of switching to a lower-priced com-
petitor’s product) is high (e.g., video game consoles). Entrepreneurs must recognize that penetration 
pricing is a long-range strategy; until customers accept the product, profits are likely to be small.
A danger of a penetration pricing strategy is that it attracts customers who know no brand 
loyalty. Companies that garner customers by offering low introductory prices run the risk of los-
ing their customer bases if they raise their prices or a competitor undercuts their prices. If the 
strategy works and the product achieves mass-market penetration, sales volume increases, and 
the company earns adequate profits. The objectives of the penetration strategy are to break into 
the market quickly, generate a high sales volume as soon as possible, and build market share.
Many consumer products, such as soap, shampoo, and light bulbs, are introduced with penetra-
tion pricing strategies.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ido Leffler: Yes to Carrots In 2006, Ido Leffler, founder 
of Yes To Inc., a company that markets a line of skin and hair care products made from car-
rots, tomatoes, cucumbers, and blueberries introduced the all-natural beauty products at very 
affordable prices. Leffler says Yes To’s pricing is based on offering customers better value than its 
principal competitors and emphasizes a guilt-free pricing model. Leffler believes customers should 
not feel guilty buying a moisturizer or shampoo that retails from $9 to $20. Yes to Carrots, which 
started with 6 products in just 16 stores, now has more than 80 products that are sold in nearly
28,000 stores in 29 countries.40 ■
SKIMMING A skimming pricing strategy often is used when a company introduces a new product 
into a market with little or no competition or to establish the company and its products or services 
as unique and superior to those of its competitors. Sometimes a business employs this tactic when

introducing a product into a competitive market that contains an elite group that is able to pay 
a higher price. Companies that use a skimming strategy often achieve success by emphasizing
the intangible benefits of their higher-priced goods and services. For instance, one lawn service 
that targets busy, upscale professionals commands premium prices by emphasizing the time and
trouble doing yard work that they save their clients and the ability to have yards that are the envy 
of the neighborhood.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Katrina Markoff: Vosges Haut-Chocolat Vosges
Haut-Chocolat, a company started by Katrina Markoff in her Chicago apartment, 
markets its intriguing chocolate creations with unusual flavor combinations—chocolate 
bars flavored with bacon, ancho and chipotle chiles and cinnamon, black Hawaiian sea salt
and burnt sugar caramel, ginger, wasabi, dark chocolate and black sesame seeds, or blood 
orange and hibiscus—as an affordable luxury, an inexpensive way for customers to indulge 
and pamper themselves. Although Vosges Haut-Chocolat’s gift boxes range in price from 
$100 to more than $1,000, customers can purchase 2-ounce bars for prices that range from 
$4 to $8.50. Markoff, who strives to tell stories about the exotic places she has traveled us-
ing chocolate as a medium, says her company sells its unique chocolates through more than 
2,000 stores and generates profits in excess of $30 million.41 ■
With this strategy, an entrepreneur uses a higher-than-normal price in an effort to
quickly recover the initial developmental and promotional costs of the product. The idea 
is to set a price well above the total unit cost and to promote the product heavily to appeal 
to the segment of the market that is not sensitive to price. This pricing tactic often rein-
forces the unique, prestigious image of a business and portrays the product as high qual-
ity. Another advantage of this technique is that entrepreneurs can correct pricing mistakes 
quickly and easily. If a product’s price proves to be too low under a penetration strategy, 
raising the price can be very difficult. If a company using a skimming strategy sets a price too 
high to generate sufficient sales volume, it can always lower the price. Successful skimming 
strategies require a company to differentiate its products or services from those of the competi-
tion, justifying the above-average price.
LIFE CYCLE PRICING A variation of the skimming price strategy is called life cycle pricing. Using 
this technique, a small company introduces a product at a high price. Then technological advances 
enable the firm to lower its costs quickly and to reduce the product’s price before its competition 
can. By beating other businesses in a price decline, the small company discourages competitors
and gradually, over time, becomes a high-volume producer. High-definition television sets are 
a prime example of a product introduced at a high price that quickly cascaded downward as 
companies forged important technology advances and took advantage of economies of scale. 
When high-definition televisions were first introduced in 1999, they sold for $19,000; today, they 
are priced at $300 or less.
Life cycle pricing is a strategy that assumes competition will emerge over time. Even if 
no competition arises, however, companies almost always lower the product’s price to attract a 
larger segment of the market. Nonetheless, the initial high price contributes to a rapid return of 
start-up costs and generates a pool of funds to finance expansion and technological advances.
Pricing Established Goods and Services
Each of the following pricing tactics or techniques are part of the toolbox of pricing tactics entre-
preneurs can use to set prices of established goods and services.
ODD PRICING Many entrepreneurs use the technique known as odd pricing in which they estab-
lish prices that end in odd numbers, such as 5, 7, or 9 because they believe that merchandise selling
for $12.69 appears to be much cheaper than the item priced at $13.00. Psychological techniques
such as odd pricing are designed to appeal to certain customer interests, but research on their 
effectiveness is mixed. Some studies show no benefits from using odd pricing, but others have 
concluded that the technique can produce significant increases in sales. Omitting the “$” symbol
from prices may help, too. Researchers at Cornell University have discovered that restaurants that 
list menu prices without the “$” symbol (e.g., “21”) achieved $5.55 more in sales on average than 
those whose menu prices were written in script or included a “$” symbol.42

CHAPTER 10 • PRICING AND CREDIT STRATEGIES
401
PRICE LINING Price lining is a technique that greatly simplifies the pricing decision by pricing 
different products in a product line at different price points, depending on their quality, features, 
and cost. Under this system, entrepreneurs sell products in several different price ranges, or 
price lines. Each category of merchandise contains items that are similar in appearance but that 
differ in quality, cost, performance, or other features. Many lined products appear in sets of at 
least three—good (basic), better (upgraded), and best (premium)—at prices designed to satisfy 
different market segment needs and incomes. Apple uses price lining for its iPad mini with retina
display, which is priced at four different points: $399 (16GB), $499 (32 GB), $599 (64 GB), 
and $699 (128 GB). Price lining can boost a company’s sales because it makes goods available
to a wide range of shoppers, simplifies the purchase decision for customers, and allows them to
choose products with prices that fit within their budgets. Companies that segment their customer 
bases and use price lines designed to appeal to each segment can improve their profit margins
between 1 and 7 percent.43
FREEMIUM PRICING Companies that use freemium pricing provide a basic product or service 
to customers for free but charge a premium for expanded or upgraded versions of the product 
or service. Products or services that customers must use or experience to appreciate their value, 
such as software, are ideal candidates for a freemium pricing strategy. The goals of a freemium 
pricing strategy are to gain rapid and extensive adoption of a product or service and to give 
potential customers a chance to discover the value it offers, particularly in its upgraded versions. 
The key to a successful freemium strategy is to expose free users to enough product or service 
features while reserving the most valuable benefits for customers who are willing to pay for the 
expanded versions. Typically, only about 2 to 4 percent of customers who use the free version 
of a product actually purchase its upgraded versions; therefore, for a freemium strategy to be 
successful, the potential market must be sizable.44 Suppose, for example, that a company’s revenue 
target is $10 million and its average annual revenue per paying customer is $120. The company 
would need 83,333 paying customers ($10 million ÷ $120 per customer) to reach its target. 
Assuming a conversion rate of 3 percent, the company would have to attract 2,777,778 free users 
(83,333 customers ÷ 3 percent) to generate $10 million in annual sales. One of the greatest 
dangers of a  freemium pricing strategy is underestimating the cost of providing service and 
support for free users.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Eric Wahlforss and Alexander Ljung: SoundCloud
While studying at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, Eric Wahlforss, 
an amateur electronic musician, and Alexander Ljung, a former sound engineer, came up with the 
idea for a simple sound-sharing tool that allowed them to swap any sound file between their 
MacBooks. The software worked so well that the entrepreneurs purchased the soundcloud.com
domain name and moved to Berlin, Germany, where they tapped into that city’s burgeoning elec-
tronic music community. Using seed money from private investors and word-of-mouth marketing
from about 20,000 users, Wahlforss and Ljung launched SoundCloud with a freemium pricing 
strategy and watched their user base grow exponentially. Customers, most of whom are musi-
cians, bands, and audio producers or their fans, can register for free and upload a limited amount
of music or receive limited access to the site’s expansive collection, which they can share with 
others via social media. Customers who upgrade (about 5 percent do) can pay $4 per month for 
four hours of sound or $12 per month for unlimited access. So far, the entrepreneurs have raised
$123 million in venture capital and have an estimated 55 million users in 200 countries.45 ■
DYNAMIC PRICING For many businesses, the pricing decision has become more challenging
because the Internet gives customers access to real-time pricing information of almost any item 
ranging from cars to computers. Increasingly, customers are using the Internet to find the lowest 
prices available. To maintain their profitability, some companies have responded with dynamic 
(or customized) pricing
r
, in which they set different prices for the same products and services 
for different customers using the information they have collected about their customers. Rather 
than sell their products at fixed prices, companies using dynamic pricing rely on fluid prices that 
may change based on supply and demand and on which customer is buying or when a customer 
makes a purchase. For instance, a first-time customer making a purchase at an online store may 
pay a higher price for an item than a regular customer who shops there frequently pays for the
same item.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Dynamic pricing is not a new concept. The standard practice in ancient bazaars involved 
merchants and customers haggling until they came to a mutually agreeable price, meaning that 
different customers paid different prices for the same goods. Although the modern version of dy-
namic pricing often involves sophisticated market research or the Internet, the goal is the same: to 
charge the right customer the right price at the right time. For example, travelers can use Priceline 
and similar Web sites to purchase last-minute airline tickets at significant discounts, such as a
round-trip ticket from New York to Los Angeles for just $250 rather than for the full-fare price of 
$750. Travelers benefit from lower prices, and the airlines are able to generate revenue from seats
that otherwise would have gone unsold.
In Casablanca, the classic romance drama film from 1942, Ilse, the 
character played by Ingrid Bergman, is looking at a set of lace nap-
kins in a shopping bazaar when she mentions that she is a friend
of Rick, the film’s lead character played by Humphrey Bogart. The 
merchant quickly replaces the original 700-franc price tag with
one bearing a 100-franc price. “For special friends of Rick’s, we have 
special discounts,” he explains to Ilse. The message was clear: Dif-
ferent prices apply to different customers.
Companies now have access to more data on their custom-
ers than at any other point in business history, and many of these 
businesses use that information to serve their customers better,
providing them with the goods and services they need just when 
they need them. One offshoot of this wealth of information is 
dynamic or customized pricing, a system in which companies 
charge different prices for the same products and services for dif-
ferent customers using the information they have collected about 
their customers. The principle is the same as that in Casablanca: 
Different prices apply to different customers. Movie theaters have 
used a simple version of dynamic pricing for years. Buy a ticket 
for an afternoon showing, traditionally a slower time for sales 
of movie tickets, and you get a lower price. Restaurants use the 
same tactic, offering “early bird” specials at off-peak hours. Air-
lines have used dynamic pricing for years as well, but their sys-
tems are much more complex. (When asked about the pricing
strategies of airlines, the CEO of a major airline company said, 
only half jokingly, “I don’t understand airline pricing either!”)
Business travelers who fly on short notice on weekdays typically 
pay higher prices than those who book in advance and travel over 
weekends. Cities such as London, Singapore, San Francisco, and 
New York use dynamic pricing strategies, charging drivers on toll 
bridges higher prices at peak commuting times and lower prices 
during off-peak hours.
Many professional and collegiate sporting events now rely 
on dynamic pricing, charging higher prices for “high demand” 
games with arch rivals or stellar matchups between star pitchers 
and lower prices for games that fans find less appealing or are 
subject to bad weather. Barry Kahn, CEO of Qcue, a small com-
pany that specializes in dynamic pricing for the sports industry, 
says dynamic pricing has enabled clients to increase their revenue 
by 30 percent by raising prices for high demand games between 
5 and 10 percent and by reducing prices for low demand games.
The practice of dynamic pricing has created controversy, however.
Is it ethical for companies to charge different customers differ-
ent prices for the same goods and services? Many surveys report
that customers believe dynamic pricing is not an acceptable busi
t
-
ness practice. However, empirical evidence shows that customized
pricing benefits not only the companies using it but also custom-
ers, making purchases more affordable for many people. Uber, a 
company based in Silicon Valley, California, provides an app that
allows people in 70 large cities worldwide to use their mobile
devices to locate drivers of the company’s army of black cars; it
uses dynamic pricing, charging higher prices when demand for 
rides is high and the supply of cars is low, typically on Friday and 
Saturday evenings, on certain holidays, and during bad weather. 
Bill Gurley, an investor in Uber, says the company is committed to
being a low-price leader in its market niche (the company’s basic
uberX rate is 40 percent cheaper than the typical taxi) and that its 
dynamic pricing strategy minimizes customers’ wait times and the
frequency with which customers experience “no cars available”
messages on their phone or tablet screens.
Ragged Mountain, a 49-year-old ski resort in New Hampshire, 
recently implemented dynamic pricing with the help of Cloud 
Store, software that gives managers the ability to change prices
on lift tickets, equipment rentals, and lessons, depending on
weather conditions, holidays, and other factors. A Valentine’s Day 
special, priced at just $14, produced a significant increase in sales 
of tickets and generated lots of positive buzz for the ski resort. On
one occasion, as a big snow storm approached the area, Ragged

Mountain was able to increase its prices gradually each day and 
still sell out its capacity. Resort managers do not mind reducing 
prices when demand is low or when conditions are less than ideal 
because they know that bringing in more customers leads to 
higher sales of meals, snacks, and beverages.
Dynamic pricing has stood successfully against several legal 
challenges. Denise Katzman filed a class-action lawsuit against 
retailer Victoria’s Secret when she discovered that a catalog she 
received listed higher prices than a nearly identical catalog the 
company sent to a male coworker. She alleged that the company 
had engaged in illegal price discrimination by charging different
prices for identical items to different categories of customers. Be-
cause Victoria’s Secret had sent the catalogs through the U.S. mail, 
Katzman claimed that the company’s discriminatory pricing struc-
ture constituted mail fraud. U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. 
Sweet upheld the validity of Victoria’s Secret’s dynamic pricing
policies, ruling that “offering different discounts to different cata-
logue customers does not constitute mail fraud under any read-
ing of the law.” On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit upheld Judge Sweet’s decision. This case suggests
that businesses can charge different customers different prices as
long as the price differences are based on reasonable business 
practices, such as rewarding loyal customers, and do not discrimi-
nate against customers for race, gender, national origin, or some
other illegal reason.
Dynamic pricing has emerged as a marketing strategy out of
necessity. Entrepreneurs say the Internet has lowered the transac-
tion costs of doing business and moves business along at such a
fast pace that the fixed pricing strategies of the past no longer 
work. To keep up with fluid, fast-changing markets, companies
must change their prices quickly. They must be able to adapt the 
prices they charge their customers on a real-time basis and to 
charge higher prices to those customers who cost their companies 
more to serve. Craig Clark, who operates an Amazon storefront 
that sells more than 2,600 items, recently began using FeedVisor, 
a service that uses sophisticated algorithms that take into account 
competitors’ prices, sales volume, a company’s costs, and other 
factors to adjust prices. Clark says that after FeedVisor reduced the
price on his store’s Coobie bras by 10 percent, sales of the bras in-
creased by 25 percent, resulting in higher profits for his company.

LEADER PRICING Leader pricing is a technique in which a retailer marks down the customary 
price (i.e., the price consumers are accustomed to paying) of a popular item in an attempt to attract 
more customers. The company earns a much smaller profit on each unit because the markup is 
lower, but purchases of other merchandise by customers seeking the leader item often boost sales 
and profits. In other words, the incidental purchases that consumers make when shopping for 
the leader item boost sales revenue enough to offset a lower profit margin on the leader. Grocery 
stores frequently use leader pricing. For instance, during the holiday season, stores often use
turkeys as a price leader, knowing that they will earn higher margins on the other items shoppers 
purchase with their turkeys. Many discount warehouses, such as Sam’s Club and Costco, and
supermarket chains, such as Albertsons, Kroger, Safeway, and Ingles, sell gasoline as a price 
leader to encourage customers to make more frequent visits to their retail stores.46
GEOGRAPHIC PRICING Small businesses whose pricing decisions are greatly affected by the costs
of shipping merchandise to customers across a wide range of geographic regions frequently 
employ one of the geographic pricing techniques. For these companies, freight expenses make up 
a substantial portion of the cost of doing business and may cut deeply into already narrow profit 
margins. One type of geographic pricing is zone pricing, in which a company sells its merchandise
at different prices to customers located in different territories. For example, a manufacturer might 
sell at one price to customers east of the Mississippi and at another to those west of the Mississippi.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
A company must be able to show a legitimate basis (e.g., differences in selling or transportation 
costs) for the price discrimination or risk violating Section 2 of the Clayton Act.
Another variation of geographic pricing is uniform delivered pricing, a technique in which a 
firm charges all of its customers the same price regardless of their location, even though the cost 
of selling or transporting merchandise varies. A company calculates the proper freight charges 
for each region and combines them into a uniform fee. The result is that local customers subsidize 
the company’s charges for shipping merchandise to distant customers.
A final variation of geographic pricing is F.O.B. factory, in which a small company sells
its merchandise to customers on the condition that they pay all shipping costs. In this way, the 
company can set a uniform price for its product and let each customer cover the freight costs.
DISCOUNTS Many small businesses use discounts (markdowns)— reductions from normal list 
prices—to move stale, outdated, damaged, or slow-moving merchandise or to stimulate sales. 
A seasonal discount is a price reduction designed to encourage shoppers to purchase merchandise
before an upcoming season. For instance, many retail clothiers offer special sales on winter coats 
in midsummer. Many merchants also offer after-Christmas discounts to make room for their 
spring merchandise. Some companies grant purchase discounts to special groups of customers, 
such as senior citizens or college students, to establish a faithful clientele and to generate repeat 
business.
As tempting as discounts are to businesses when sales are slow, they carry risks. Ideally, dis-
counts win loyal customers who make repeat purchases. Cindy Dickey, owner of a Merle Norman 
Cosmetics store in Enid, Oklahoma, tied a discount offer to a special promotion that increased 
her store’s sales by requiring customers to return to earn the discount. For a limited time, Dickey 
allowed customers to select a sealed envelope that contained a gift certificate valued at between 
$5 and $100 that they could redeem on their next visit.47 The reality of discounts, however, is
that they often attract customers who are merely seeking bargains and who rarely turn into loyal
customers. Cacio e Vino, a Sicilian restaurant in New York City’s Manhattan borough, offers a
limited number of reservations at a 40 percent discount through Groupon Reserve to draw cus-
tomers on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays, the restaurant’s slowest nights. On Wednesdays and
Thursdays, Cacio e Vino offers a limited number of diners 30 percent discounts but only between
5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Manager Christine Ehlert says the discounts are a tool to attract new customers
to the restaurant during times that it is operating at less than full capacity. Although the discounts
have increased sales from an average of $800 to $1,200 to $1,500 on Mondays and Tuesdays, 
they cut into the restaurant’s profit margin, reducing it by 50 percent compared to full-price cus-
tomers. In addition, fewer than half of Cacio e Vino’s discount customers return, and when they 
do, it almost always is for a discounted meal.48
Excessive discounting also diminishes or eradicates altogether a company’s profit margin. 
Perry Schorr, co-owner of Lester’s, a 65-year-old retailer that sells clothing for children and
teens and targets affluent families, makes limited use of discounts. With four stores in New York, 
Schorr knows that his customers are more interested in quality products and attentive service 
than discount prices. During the competitive Black Friday weekend that kicks off the holiday 
season, which accounts for 15 percent of the company’s sales, Lester’s offers modest discounts
of 20 percent on select items and adds sales staff to ensure that customer service does not suffer. 
Schorr sees Black Friday as a price-driven event and says small companies such as his cannot 
build a successful strategy by discounting prices and cheapening their images.49
Companies that frequently resort to discounts may ruin their reputation for superior quality 
and service, thereby diluting the value of their brand and image in the marketplace. Frequent 
discounting sends customers the message that a company’s regular prices are too high and that 
they should wait for the next sale to make a purchase. As many retailers and restaurants learned 
from the last recession, weaning customers off of discounts can be difficult; the climb back to 
“normal” pricing can be long and arduous. One less visible way for companies to offer discounts 
is to enroll customers in a loyalty program that entitles them to earned discounts. Loyalty pro-
grams, such as those at supermarkets, pet stores, and bookstores, not only encourage shoppers to
return but also provide businesses with meaningful data on customers’ buying habits, allowing
them to decipher patterns and trends. Belk, a family-owned chain of department stores with more 
than 300 locations in 16 southern states, offers rewards to customers who make purchases on 
delivered pricing

company charges all cus-
tomers the same price

and different transportation 
costs.

Limited time offers (LTOs) are discounts that retailers run for a limited amount of time
(“Regular price: $150. Sale price $120 for three days only.”) with the goal of creating a sense of 
urgency and excitement among customers. Although LTOs are a common pricing tool for many 
retailers, quick-service restaurants are perhaps the most frequent users of LTOs. To create a suc-
cessful LTO, retailers should emphasize the end date of the offer and include a distinct call to 
action in their advertising, promote the offer on social media as well as in traditional advertising 
channels, and end the offer on the advertised date. Toppers Pizza, a pizza chain with 41 locations 
in the Midwest and South, has had great success running periodic, aggressively priced LTOs 
(such as a one-topping large pizza for just $5) by promoting them among its 50,000 Facebook 
fans. Scott Iversen, the company’s vice-president of marketing, says the number of transactions 
the company makes during the LTO is twice the number during a normal week and that sales of 
drinks and side items make up for the lower profit on the LTO.50
Recent research suggests that using a steadily decreasing discount (SDD), a limited dura-
tion discount that declines over time, is superior to a standard (hi-lo) discount, a common tactic 
in which a company offers frequent discounts off its standard prices. When one company used 
a hi-lo discount of 20 percent for three days before returning to the items to full price, sales in-
creased by 75 percent. For the same items, a steadily decreasing discount of 30 percent the first 
day, 20 percent the second day, and 10 percent the third day (which yielded the same average 
discount of 20 percent), produced an increase in sales of 200 percent. The researchers conclude 
that the SDD is more effective because it creates a sense of urgency, especially among wary 
or indecisive customers.51 Research also shows that for items other than luxury goods, dollar 
discounts (“Save $25 now”) are more effective at generating sales than percentage discounts 
(“Save 25% now”).52
Multiple unit pricing is a promotional technique that offers customers discounts if they 
purchase in quantity. Many products, especially those with relatively low unit value, are sold us-
ing multiple pricing. For example, instead of selling an item for 50 cents, a small company might 
offer five for $2.
BUNDLING Many small businesses have discovered the marketing benefits of bundling, grouping 
together several products or services or both into a package that offers customers extra value
at a special price. Fast-food outlets often bundle items into “meal deals” that customers can 
purchase at lower prices than if they bought the items separately. Even upscale restaurants use 
bundled pricing; at New York City’s tony Per Se, diners can choose between two nine-course prix 
fixe chef’s tasting menus for $310 per person. Bundling is another way for companies to offer 
customers discounts without damaging their reputations. Rebecca Kaplan, who operates family-
owned Glazer’s Camera, in Seattle, Washington, with her brother, Ari Lackman, shuns traditional 
discounts because the profit margins on the photographic equipment the store sells are too slim to 
offer price reductions. Instead, Glazer’s Camera offers customers limited discounts by bundling
cameras with high-end accessories, such as tripods, lenses, and camera bags, at special prices. To 
differentiate their store from competitors, Kaplan and Lackman invest in training their staff and 
offer special services, such as in-store photography classes.53
OPTIONAL-PRODUCT PRICING Optional-product pricing involves selling the base product for 
one price but selling the options or accessories for it at a much higher markup. Automobiles are
often sold at a base price with each option priced separately. In some cases, the car is sold with 
some of the options “bundled” together, as explained previously.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Amish Backyard Structures Amish Backyard Structures, 
a small company in tiny Oxford, Pennsylvania, that makes children’s playhouses, sheds, 
barns, gazebos, and lawn furniture, uses an optional-product pricing strategy. The company’s 
playhouses are handcrafted from top-quality materials, range in size from 6 by 8 feet to 10 by 
20 feet, and come in designs that resemble Cape Cod cottages and Victorian mansions. Parents 
can choose to customize their children’s playhouses with a variety of options, such as heart-shaped 
windows, chimneys, porch swings, fully finished interiors, and playhouse furniture, including 
wooden sink and stove combinations and refrigerators.54 ■

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
CAPTIVE-PRODUCT PRICING Captive-product pricing is a pricing strategy in which the base 
product is not functional without the appropriate accessory. King Gillette, the founder of Gillette, 
taught the business world that the real money is not in selling the razor (the product) but in selling 
the blades (the accessory)! Manufacturers of electronic games also rely on captive-product 
pricing, earning lower margins on the game consoles and substantially higher margins on the 
game cartridges they sell.
BY-PRODUCT PRICING By-product pricing is a technique in which the revenues from the sale 
of by-products allow a company to be more competitive in its pricing of the main product. For 
years, sawmills saw the bark from the trees they processed as a nuisance, something they had to
discard. Now it is packaged and sold to gardeners who use the bark chips for ground cover. Zoos 
across the globe offer one of the most creative examples of by-product pricing, packaging once
worthless droppings of exotic animals and marketing it as compost under the clever name “Zoo 
Doo.” Zoo Doo is so popular that Seattle Washington’s Woodland Park Zoo conducts a lottery to 
determine which customers can purchase the compost, which is priced at $12.95 for a two-gallon 
container.55
SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES Many manufacturers print suggested retail prices on their products 
or include them on invoices or in wholesale catalogs. Small business owners frequently follow
these suggested retail prices because doing so eliminates the need to make a pricing decision. 
Nonetheless, following prices established by a distant manufacturer may create problems
for a small company. For example, a men’s clothing store may try to create a high-quality, 
exclusive image through a prestige pricing policy, but manufacturers may suggest prices that 
are incompatible with the company’s image. Another danger of accepting the manufacturer’s 
suggested price is that it does not take into consideration a small company’s cost structure or 
competitive situation. In a U.S. Supreme Court case in 2007, Leegin Creative Products vs. PSKS, 
Leegin, the maker of Brighton brand belts, refused to sell its products to a small Texas boutique 
when the retailer discounted its prices on Brighton belts below the minimum prices established 
in an agreement the parties had signed. The court ruled in favor of Leegin, overturning a nearly 
100-year-old ruling and allowing manufacturers to set and enforce minimum prices retailers can
charge for the manufacturer’s products as long as doing so does not reduce competition. Several 
states are considering passing new antitrust laws in an attempt to preempt the court’s decision.56
FOLLOW-THE-LEADER PRICING Some small companies make no effort to be price leaders in 
their immediate geographic areas and simply follow the prices that their competitors establish. 
Entrepreneurs should monitor their competitors’ pricing policies and individual prices by 
reviewing their advertisements or by hiring part-time or full-time comparison shoppers. However,
some retailers use this information to establish me-too pricing policies, which eradicate any 
opportunity to create a special price image for their businesses. Although many retailers must 
match competitors’ prices on identical items, maintaining a follow-the-leader pricing policy may
not be healthy for a small business because it robs the company of the opportunity to create a 
distinctive image in its customers’ eyes.
The underlying forces that dictate how a business prices its goods or services vary across
industries. The next three sections investigate pricing techniques used in retailing, manufactur-
ing, and service businesses.
Pricing Strategies and Methods for Retailers
As customers have become more price conscious, retailers have changed their pricing strategies 
to emphasize value. This value–price relationship allows for a wide variety of highly creative 
pricing and marketing practices. As discussed previously, delivering high levels of recognized 
value in products and services is one key to retail customer loyalty.
Markup
The basic premise of a successful business operation is selling a good or service for more than 
it costs to produce or provide. The difference between the cost of a product or service and its 
selling price is called markup (or markon). A business’s markup must be large enough to

produce a reasonable profit. Markup can be expressed in dollars or as a percentage of either cost 
or selling price:
Dollar markup = Retail price − Cost of the merchandise
Percentage (of retail price) markup = Dollar markup
Retail price
Percentage (of cost) markup = Dollar markup
Cost of unit
For example, if a shirt costs $14, and a retailer plans to sell it for $30, the markup would be 
as follows:
Dollar markup = $30 − $14 = $16
Percentage (of retail price) markup = $16
$30 = 53.3%
Percentage (of cost) markup = $16
$14 = 114.3%
The cost of merchandise used in computing markup includes not only the wholesale price of 
the merchandise but also any other costs (e.g., selling or transportation charges) that the retailer 
incurs and a profit minus any discounts (quantity, cash) that the wholesaler offers. Markups vary 
across industries, but in the designer clothing business, markups (of cost) of between 150 and 
250 percent are common. However, some brands command much higher markups. For instance, 
a pair of jeans at Kohl’s carries a markup of cost of about 100 percent, but True Religion’s 
Phantom jeans generate an impressive 360 percent markup of cost.57 The markup on a bottle of 
wine in a retail shop is 50 percent (of cost), but in New York City’s fine dining restaurants, the
markup on the same bottles of wine is between 200 and 300 percent.58 Movie theater popcorn 
usually carries an even higher markup (of cost) of 1,275 percent.59 Table 10.1 shows a break-
down of the cost of the components and markup calculations for Apple’s third generation iPad 
and Microsoft’s Surface tablets.
Once entrepreneurs create a financial plan, including sales estimates and anticipated ex-
penses, they can compute their companies’ initial markup. The initial markup is the average
markup required on all merchandise to cover the cost of the items, all incidental expenses, and a
reasonable profit:
Initial dollar markup = Operating expenses + Reductions + Profif t
Net sales + Reductions
where operating expenses include the cost of doing business, such as rent, utilities, and deprecia-
tion, and reductions include employee and customer discounts, markdowns, special sales, and 
the cost of stock-outs. Entrepreneurs must be aware of the impact that discounts have on their 
markup percentages. Corey Kaplan, owner of NYC Bagel Deli, a bagel shop with three loca-
tions in Chicago, recently sold 10,500 coupons on the discount coupon site Groupon that offered 
$10 worth of food for just $4, an amount that equals the company’s cost of goods sold. The result: 
a markup of zero percent.60
Suppose that a small retailer forecasts sales of $980,000, operating expenses of $544,000, 
and $24,000 in reductions. If the retailer establishes a target profit of $58,000, the initial markup 
(of retail price) percentage is calculated as follows:
Initial markup percentage = 544,000 + 24,000 + 58,000
980,000 + 24,000
= 62%
Any item in the store that carries a markup (of retail price) of at least 62 percent covers costs and 
meets the owner’s profit objective. Any item that has a markup of less than 62 percent reduces 
the company’s net income.

408
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Once an entrepreneur determines the initial percentage markup, he or she can compute the 
appropriate retail price using the following formula:
Retail Price =
Dollar cost
(1 - Percentage of retail price markup)
For instance, applying the 62 percent markup to an item that cost the retailer $17.00 gives the 
following result:
Retail price =
$17.00
(1 - .62) = $44.74
The owner establishes a retail price of $44.74 for this item using a 62 percent (of retail price)
markup.
Finally, retailers must verify that the retail price they have calculated is consistent with their 
companies’ image. Will it cover costs and generate the desired profit? Is the final price in line with 
the company’s strategy? Is it within an acceptable price range? How does it compare to the prices 
charged by competitors? And, perhaps most important, are customers willing and able to pay this 
price? Figure 10.4 explains the mathematics of markups—and markdowns—at the retail level.
Pricing Concepts for Manufacturers
For manufacturers, the pricing decision requires the support of accurate, timely accounting 
records. The most commonly used pricing technique for manufacturers is cost-plus pricing. 
Using this method, a manufacturer establishes a price that is composed of direct materials, direct

labor, factory overhead, selling and administrative costs, plus a desired profit margin. Figure 10.5 
illustrates the cost-plus pricing components.
The main advantage of the cost-plus pricing method is its simplicity. Given the proper cost 
accounting data, computing a product’s final selling price is relatively easy. In addition, because 
they add a profit onto the top of their companies’ costs, manufacturers are likely to achieve their 
desired profit margins. This process, however, does not encourage the manufacturers to use their 
resources efficiently. Even if the company fails to employ its resources in the most effective man-
ner, it still earns a profit, and thus there is no motivation to conserve resources in the manufactur-
ing process. Finally, because manufacturers’ cost structures vary so greatly, cost-plus pricing fails 
to consider the competition (and market forces) sufficiently. Despite its drawbacks, the cost-plus 
method of establishing prices remains popular in industries such as construction and printing.
Direct Costing and Pricing
One requisite for a successful pricing policy in manufacturing is a reliable cost accounting sys-
tem that can generate timely reports to determine the costs of processing raw materials into 
finished goods. The traditional method of product costing is called absorption costing because
all manufacturing and overhead costs are absorbed into a finished product’s total cost. Absorp-
tion costing includes direct materials, direct labor, plus a portion of fixed and variable factory 
overhead in each unit manufactured. Full absorption financial statements are used in published 
annual reports and in tax reports and are very useful in performing financial analysis. However, 
full absorption statements are of little help to manufacturers when determining prices or the 
impact of price changes.
A more useful technique for managerial decision making is variable (direct) costing, in 
which the cost of the products manufactured includes only those costs that vary directly with the 
quantity produced. In other words, variable costing encompasses direct materials, direct labor,

and factory overhead costs that vary with the level of the company’s output of finished goods. 
Factory overhead costs that are fixed (rent, depreciation, and insurance) are not included in the
t
costs of finished items. Instead, they are considered to be expenses of the period.
A manufacturer’s goal when establishing prices is to discover the combination of selling 
price and sales volume that covers the variable costs of producing a product and contributes 
toward covering fixed costs and earning a profit. Full-absorption costing clouds the true relation-
ships among price, volume, and costs by including fixed expenses in unit cost. Direct costing,
however, yields a constant unit cost for the product no matter what volume of production. The 
result is a clearer picture of the relationship among price, volume, and costs.
The starting point for establishing product prices is the direct cost income statement. As
Table 10.2 indicates, the direct cost statement yields the same net income as does the full-
absorption income statement. The only difference between the two statements is the format. The 
full-absorption statement allocates costs such as advertising, rent, and utilities according to the 
activity that caused them, but the direct cost income statement separates expenses into their fixed 
and variable components. Fixed expenses remain constant regardless of the production level, but 
variable expenses fluctuate according to production volume.
When variable costs are subtracted from total revenues, the result is the manufacturer’s 
contribution margin—the amount remaining that contributes to covering fixed expenses and

earning a profit. Expressing this contribution margin as a percentage of total revenue yields the 
company’s contribution percentage. Computing the contribution percentage is a critical step in 
establishing prices through the direct costing method. This manufacturer’s contribution margin 
percentage is 36.5 percent, which is calculated as follows:
Contribution percentage = 1 - Variable expenses
Revenues
= 1 - $502,000
$790,000 = 36.5%
Computing the Break-Even Selling Price
The manufacturer’s contribution percentage tells what portion of total revenues remains after cover-
ing variable costs to contribute toward meeting fixed expenses and earning a profit. This manufac-
turer’s contribution percentage is 36.5 percent, which means that variable costs absorb 63.5 percent 
of total revenue. In other words, variable costs make up 63.5 percent (1.00 − 0.365 = 0.635) of the 
product’s selling price. Suppose that this manufacturer’s variable costs include the following:
Material
$2.08/unit
Direct labor
$4.12/unit
Variable factory overhead
$0.78/unit
Total variable cost
$6.98/unit
The minimum price at which the manufacturer would sell the item for is $6.98. Any price 
below this would not cover variable costs. To compute the break-even selling price for this prod-
uct, we find the selling price using the following equation:
Break@even selling price = Profif t + (Variable cost per unit * Quantity produced) + Total fif xed cost
Quantity produced
To break even, the manufacturer assumes $0 profit. Suppose that plans are to produce 50,000 units 
of the product and that fixed costs will be $110,000. The break-even selling price is as follows:
Break@even selling price = $0 + ($6.98 * 50,000 units) + $110,000
50,000 units
=
$459,000
50,000 units
= $9.18/u/ nit
Thus, $2.20 ($9.18/unit − $6.98/unit) of the $9.18 break-even price contributes to meeting fixed
production costs. But suppose the manufacturer wants to earn a $50,000 profit. Then the selling 
price is calculated as follows:
Selling price = $50,000 + ($6.98/u/ nit * 50,000 units) + $110,000
50,000 units
=
$509,000
50,000 units
= $10.18/u/ nit
Now the manufacturer must decide whether customers will purchase 50,000 units at $10.18. 
If not, he or she must decide either to produce a different, more profitable product or to lower the
selling price by lowering either its cost or its profit target. Any price above $9.18 will generate 
some profit although less than that desired. In the short run, the manufacturer could sell the prod-
uct for less than $9.18 if competitive factors dictate but not below $6.98 because a price below 
t
$6.98 would not cover the variable cost of production.

412
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Because the manufacturer’s capacity in the short run is fixed, pricing decisions should be
aimed at employing these resources most efficiently. The fixed costs of operating the plant cannot 
be avoided, and the variable costs can be eliminated only if the firm ceases offering the product. 
Therefore, the selling price must be at least equal to the variable costs (per unit) of making the 
product. Any price above this amount contributes to covering fixed costs and providing a reason-
able profit.
Of course, over the long run, a manufacturer cannot sell below total costs and continue to 
survive. The final selling price must cover total product cost—both fixed and variable—and gen-
erate a reasonable profit.
Pricing Strategies and Methods for Service Firms
Service businesses must establish their prices on the basis of the materials used to provide the
service, the labor employed, an allowance for overhead, and profit. As in a manufacturing opera-
tion, a service business must have a reliable, accurate accounting system to keep a tally of the 
total costs of providing the service. Most service firms base their prices on an hourly rate, usu-
ally the actual number of hours required to perform the service. Some companies, however, base 
their fees on a standard number of hours, determined by the average number of hours needed to 
perform the service. For most firms, labor and materials make up the largest portion of the cost 
Pricing decisions have a significant influence on a company’s abil-
ity to generate a profit. Research by consulting firm Deloitte shows
that pricing has four times the impact on profitability as other 
improvements, such as reducing costs. When entrepreneurs make 
pricing decisions, they usually look at the retail price or the invoice
price they charge. Doing so, however, may be misleading if the 
company offers significant “off-invoice” discounts, such as cash 
discounts for paying early, quantity discounts for large purchases,
special promotional discounts, and others. These invoice leak-
ages mean that a business is getting less—sometimes far less—
than the retail or invoice price listed. In some cases, a company’s 
pocket price, the price it receives for a product or a service after 
deducting all discounts and purchase incentives, is far below the
listed retail or invoice price. The impact of these discounts can be 
significant. Research by the consulting firm McKinsey and Com-
pany shows that a decrease of 1 percent in a typical company’s 
average prices will reduce its operating profits by 8 percent if all 
other factors remain constant.
How are discounts affecting your business? To find out,
you must estimate your company’s pocket price waterfall and its
pocket price band. The pocket price waterfall starts with a com-
pany’s invoice or retail price on the far left of the diagram and 
then shows how much every discount or incentive the company 
offers its customers reduces that price. In the example in Figure 1, 
this small manufacturer offers a cash discount for early payment 
that shaves 2.0 percent off of the retail price, a 3.5 percent dis-
count for companies whose purchases exceed a particular volume, 
a cooperative advertising program (in which it splits the cost of
advertising its products with retailers) that amounts to 4.4 per-
cent, and periodic promotional discounts to move products that 
average 10.8 percent. Other discounts the company offered
customers further reduced its pocket price. In the end, the com-
pany’s average pocket price is 77.2 percent of the listed invoice 
price (see Figure 1).
Not every customer qualifies for every discount, however. The 
type and the amount of the discount vary from one customer to
another; the pocket prices they pay can vary a good deal. There-
fore, it is important to estimate the width of the company’s pocket 
price band, which shows the percentage of sales that each pocket 
price (shown as a percentage of the listed invoice or retail price)
accounts for (see Figure 2). In this example, pocket prices that are
90 percent or more of the company’s invoice price account for just
28.3 percent of its total revenue. Conversely, pocket prices that

are 80 percent or less of its invoice price make up 46.2 percent of 
its total revenue. The final step in the process is to identify the in-
dividual customers that make up each segment of the company’s 
pocket price band. When one manufacturer analyzed its pocket 
price band, managers discovered that sales to 20 percent of its 
customers had slipped below its break-even point, causing the 
company to lose money on sales to those customers. To restore
profitability, managers raised prices selectively and lowered their 
costs by reducing the frequency of deliveries and encouraging
customers to place orders online.
A wide pocket price band is not necessarily bad. It simply
shows that some customers generate much higher pocket prices 
than others. When a band is wide, small changes in its shape can 
produce big results for a company. If an entrepreneur can increase 
sales at the upper end of the band while reducing or even drop-
ping altogether those at the lower end of the band, the company’s
revenues and profits will climb. If a company’s price band is nar-
row, an entrepreneur has less room to maneuver prices, chang-
ing the shape of the band is more difficult, and any changes the 
entrepreneur can make tend to have less impact on the company’s 
sales and revenues.
When one lighting company calculated its pocket price band, 
managers were surprised at its width. Once managers realized
how big a dent discounts were putting in its revenues and profits,
they worked with the sales force to realign the company’s discount 
structure. Some of the company’s smallest accounts had been get-
ting the largest discounts despite their small volume of purchases. 
Managers also focused on boosting sales to those accounts that 
were producing the highest pocket prices. These changes resulted 
in the company’s average pocket price rising by 3.8 percent and its 
profits climbing 51 percent!
Discounts tend to work their way into a company’s pricing 
structure gradually over time, often one transaction at a time, 
especially if an entrepreneur gives sales representatives latitude to 
negotiate prices with customers. Few companies make the effort
to track these discounts and, as a result, do not realize the im-
pact that discounts have on their profitability. By monitoring their
companies’ pocket price waterfall and the resulting pocket price
band, entrepreneurs can improve significantly the revenue and the 
profits they generate.

of the service. To establish a reasonable, profitable price for service, small business owners must 
know the cost of materials, direct labor, and overhead for each unit of service they provide. Using 
these basic cost data and a desired profit margin, an owner of a small service firm can determine 
the appropriate price for the service.
Consider a simple example for pricing a common service—computer repair. Ned’s Com-
puter Repair Shop uses the direct costing method to prepare an income statement for exercising
managerial control (see Table 10.3).
Ned estimates that he and his employees spent about 9,250 hours in the actual production 
of computer repair service. Therefore, total cost per productive hour for Ned’s Computer Repair 
Shop comes to the following:
$104,000 + $68,000
9,250 hours
= $18.59/h/ our
Now Ned must add in an amount for his desired profit. He expects a net operating profit of 
18 percent on sales. To compute the final price, he uses the following equation:
Price Total cost per hour = productive hour , (1 - net profif t target as % of sales)
= $18.59 , (1 - .18)
= $22.68/h/ our

414
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
A price of $22.68 per hour will cover Ned’s costs and generate the desired profit. Smart 
service shop owners compute their cost per production hour at regular intervals throughout the 
year. Rapidly rising labor costs and material prices dictate that an entrepreneur calculate the com-
pany’s price per hour even more frequently. As in the case of the retailer and the manufacturer,
Ned must evaluate the pricing policies of competitors and decide whether his price is consistent 
with his company’s image.
Of course, the price of $22.68 per hour assumes that each job requires the same amount 
of materials. If this is not a valid assumption, Ned must recalculate the price per hour without
including the cost of materials:
Cost per productive hour = $172,000 - $40,500
9,250 hours
= $14.22/h/ our
Adding in the desired 18 percent net operating profit on sales gives the following:
Price per hour = $14.22/h/ our , (1.00 - 0.18)
= $17.34/h/ our
Under these conditions, Ned would charge $17.34 per hour plus the actual cost of materials 
used and any markup on the cost of material. A repair job that takes four hours to complete would 
have the following price, assuming a 60 percent markup (of cost) on materials.
Cost of service (4 hours × $17.34/hour)
$ 69.36
Cost of materials
$ 41.00
Markup on materials (60%)
$ 24.60
Total price
$134.96
Because services are intangible, their pricing offers more flexibility than do tangible prod-
ucts. One danger that entrepreneurs face is pricing their services too low because prospective 
customers’ perceptions of a service are heavily influenced by its price. In other words, establish-
ing a low price for a service may actually harm a service company’s sales. For service companies 
in particular, the right price reflects both the company’s cost of providing the service and the 
customers’ perceived value of the service.
The Impact of Credit on Pricing
Consumers crave convenience when they shop, and one of the most common conveniences they
demand is the ability to purchase goods and services on credit. Small businesses that fail to
offer credit to their customers lose sales to competitors who do. One recent study shows that the

58 percent of small business owners say that their customers expect them to accept credit cards;
in addition, the majority of consumers shop only at businesses that accept multiple forms of pay-
ment, including credit cards (see Figure 10.6).61 However, companies that sell on credit incur 
additional expenses for offering this convenience. Small companies have three options for selling
to customers on credit: credit (and debit) cards, installment credit, and trade credit.
Credit Cards
Consumers in the United States hold nearly 1.9 billion credit cards; in fact, the average credit 
card holder in the United States has 3.75 cards.62 Shoppers use credit cards to make 26 bil-
lion transactions a year that account for more than $2.48 trillion worth of goods and services 
annually—nearly $78,600 in credit card sales per second.63 The message is clear: Customers
expect to make purchases with credit cards, and small companies that fail to accept credit cards 
run the risk of losing sales to competitors who do. The average credit card transaction is $94.64
Research shows that customers who use credit cards make purchases that are 112 percent higher 
than if they had used cash.65 In addition, surveys show that customers rate businesses offering 
credit options higher on key performance measures such as reputation, reliability, and service.66
In short, accepting credit cards broadens a small company’s customer base and closes sales that 
it would normally lose if customers had to pay in cash.
Companies that accept credit cards incur additional expenses for offering this convenience, 
however. Businesses must pay to use the system, typically 1 to 6 percent of the total credit card
charge, which they must factor into the prices of their products or services. They also pay a 
transaction fee of 5 to 25 cents per charge. (The average fee is 10 cents per transaction.) Given 
customer expectations, small businesses cannot afford to drop major cards, even when credit 
card companies raise the fees merchants must pay. Fees operate on a multistep process (see
Figure 10.7). On a typical $100 credit card purchase that a customer makes, the bank that issued 
the customer’s card receives $1.85. This amount includes a 1.75 percent processing fee called the 
interchange fee, the fee that banks collect from retailers whenever customers use a credit or a 
debit card to pay for a purchase, and a 10-cent flat transaction fee. The credit card company takes
0.13 percent (or 13 cents in this example) of the transaction amount. The retailer’s bank, called 
the processing bank, receives a processing fee of 0.25 percent of the purchase amount plus a 
10-cent flat transaction fee (or 35 cents in this example), leaving the retailer with $97.67. Before 
it can accept credit cards, a business must obtain merchant status from either a bank or an inde-
pendent sales organization. Square, a company that issues a free credit card reader to merchants 
that attaches to smart phones and tablets, consolidates all three fees and charges merchants a flat 
fee of 2.75 percent.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Zack Zilverman and Alex Rein: Kelvin Natural Slush
Zack Silverman and Alex Rein, who left their careers as attorneys to start Kelvin Natural 
Slush, a food truck that navigates the streets of New York City selling all-natural slushies made 
from real fruit purée, say Square has been an essential part of their mobile business’s success. The
entrepreneurs say they were considering spending $4,000 on touch-screen computers and soft-
ware before they learned about Square. Rather than spend $4,000 on hardware and software, 
Silverman and Rein purchased a $400 iPad, attached Square to it, and process customers’ credit 
cards from wherever they are. Square also gives them the ability to download sales reports at any
time.67 ■
Credit card processing fees, commonly known as “swipe fees,” cost merchants $40 billion 
per year, and small businesses typically pay higher credit card processing fees than their larger 
counterparts.68 These fees, especially on small purchases, can wipe out any profit the company 
might have earned. To minimize the fees associated with credit card transactions, some entrepre-
neurs offer customers incentives to pay with cash.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Doug Hendrick: Steamer’s Café Doug Hendrick, owner 
of Steamer’s Café, a small restaurant in Clinton, South Carolina, conducts a monthly draw-
ing for a $20 gift card for customers who pay with cash rather than with credit cards. Hendrick says 
that fees absorb 3 percent of every credit card purchase. “Multiply that by thousands of customers 
and divide it by a thin profit margin, and it’s a huge chunk,” he says.69 ■
E-COMMERCE AND CREDIT CARDS When it comes to online business transactions, the most 
common method of payment is the credit card. Internet merchants are constantly challenged 
by the need to provide secure methods for safe, secure online transactions. As you learned in 
Chapter 9, many shoppers are suspicious of online transactions for reasons of security and 
privacy. Therefore, online merchants must ensure their customers’ privacy and the security of 
their credit card transactions by using encryption software.

Another obstacle is credit card fraud, which cost U.S. companies $11.27 billion annually.
Credit card issuers assumed the burden for 63 percent of that loss, and the remaining 37 percent 
fell on merchants.70 Because they lack the face-to-face contact with their customers, online mer-
chants face special challenges to avoid credit card fraud. Identity and credit card theft results in 
customers denying the authenticity of certain purchases and disputing the charges that appear on 
their bills. Unless merchants are vigilant, they will end up shouldering most of the burden for 
these charge-backs. About 0.9 percent of online credit card transactions are fraudulent, costing 
merchants $3.5 billion a year!71 Because small companies are less likely than large businesses 
to use high-tech online fraud detection tools, they are more likely to be victims of e-commerce 
fraud. The following steps can help online merchants reduce the probability that they will be-
come victims of credit card fraud:
● Use an address verification system to compare every customer’s billing information on the 
order form with the billing information in the bank or credit card company’s records.
● Require customers to provide the CVV2 number from the back of the credit card. Although 
crooks can get access to this number, it can help screen out some fraudulent orders.
● Check customers’ Internet protocol (IP) addresses. If an order contains a billing address in 
California but the IP address from which the order is placed is in China, chances are that 
the order is fraudulent.
● Monitor activity on the Web site with the help of a Web analytics software package. There 
are many packages available, and analyzing log files helps online entrepreneurs pinpoint 
the sources of fraud.
● Verify large orders. Large orders are a cause for celebration but only if they are legitimate.
Check the authenticity of large orders, especially if the order is from a first-time customer.
● Post notices on the Web site that your company uses antifraud technology to screen orders. 
These notices make legitimate customers feel more confident about placing their orders 
and crooks trying to commit fraud tentative about running their scams.
● Contact the credit card company or the bank that issued the card. If you suspect that an 
order may be fraudulent, contact the company before processing it. Taking this step could 
save a company thousands of dollars in losses.72
DEBIT CARDS Consumers in the United States carry more than 580 million debit cards that act as 
electronic checks, automatically deducting the purchase amount immediately from a customer’s 
checking account.73 Shoppers conduct nearly 53 billion debit card transactions, totaling $2.1 trillion 
each year. The average debit card transaction is $39.62.74 In 2003, for the first time in history, 
shoppers used credit and debit cards more often than cash or checks to make retail purchases.75
The equipment that allows businesses to accept debit cards is easy to install and to set up, and the 
cost to the company is negligible. The payoff can be big, however, in the form of increased sales, 
improved cash flow, and decreased losses from bad checks. In addition, interchange fees on debit 
cards are lower than those on credit cards. Credit and debit cards account for nearly two-thirds of 
all consumer and business payments, and that percentage continues to grow.76 Small businesses
that do not accept credit and debit cards operate at a disadvantageous position.
MOBILE WALLETS Modern smart phone technology allows shoppers to carry mobile wallets
on their smart phones or tablets. Shoppers download software that links their mobile devices 
to a credit or debit card and then swipe the devices over a near field communication (NFC)
or Quick Response (QR) reader to complete a purchase. Today, shoppers make $31 billion in 
mobile purchases, nearly three times the $11.6 billion in 2012.77 Google Wallet, the first mobile 
wallet application, now has competition from other large companies, including AT&T, Verizon 
Wireless, T-Mobile, and small start-ups such as Square and Dwolla. To accept payments from 
customers’ mobile wallets, some applications require special hardware (which typically cost 
between $100 and $200), but others use stores’ existing checkout equipment that is updated with
software business owners usually download for free.78 The technology not only speeds up the 
checkout process but also allows merchants to recognize customers when they walk into a store;

send personalized coupons, incentives, and rewards to them; and generate useful reports, such as 
how often a shopper buys a particular item or when he or she last shopped. At Marcia and Dean 
Harris’s Itzy Bitzy Ritzy Shop, a store in Norwalk, Connecticut, that sells furniture designed for 
small spaces, shoppers with mobile devices use Square Wallet to make their furniture purchases 
quickly and easily, and the money shows up in the store’s bank account the next day.79
Installment Credit
Small companies that sell big-ticket consumer durables—such as major appliances, cars, and 
boats—frequently rely on installment credit to support their sales efforts. Because very few cus-
tomers can purchase such items in a single lump-sum payment, small businesses finance them over 
an extended time. The time horizon may range from just a few months up to 30 or more years. Most 
companies require customers to make an initial down payment for the merchandise and then fi-
nance the balance for the life of the loan. The customer repays the loan principal plus interest on the 
loan. One advantage of installment loans for a small business is that the owner retains a security in-
terest as collateral on the loan. If a customer defaults on the loan, the owner still holds the title to the 
merchandise. Because installment credit absorbs a small company’s cash, many rely on financial 
institutions, such as banks and credit unions, to provide installment credit. When a company has 
the financial strength to “carry its own paper,” the interest income from the installment loan con-
tract often yields more than the initial profit on the sale of the product. For some businesses, such
as furniture stores and used car dealerships, this traditionally has been a major source of income.
Trade Credit
Companies that sell small-ticket items frequently offer their customers trade credit—that is, 
they create customer charge accounts. The typical small business bills its credit customers each
month. To speed collections, some offer cash discounts if customers pay their balances early; oth-
ers impose penalties on late payers. Before deciding to use trade credit as a competitive weapon, 
business owners must make sure that their companies’ cash position is strong enough to support 
the additional pressure credit sales create.
LAYAWAY Although technically not a form of credit, layaway plans, like trade credit, enable
customers to purchase goods over time. In the typical layaway plan, a customer selects an item, 
pays a deposit on it, and makes regular payments on the item until it is paid in full. Unlike trade 
credit, the retailer keeps the item until the customer has finished paying. Most stores establish 
minimum payments and maximum payoff dates, and some charge a service fee. Created during
the Great Depression as a way to help shoppers purchase goods, layaway has become popular 
once again, especially around the holiday season, as stubborn unemployment and slow economic
growth have posed challenges for shoppers.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Marlana Walters: The Everyday Gourmet Marlana 
Walters, owner of The Everyday Gourmet, a kitchen and household accessory store with 
two locations in Mississippi, recently introduced a layaway plan for the holiday season on popular 
big-ticket items that cost at least $300 after she noted customers’ reluctance to purchase her com-
pany’s higher-priced items. Walters sees layaway as a tool to provide her customers with more time
to pay for their purchases. The Everyday Gourmet has a simple layaway plan: Divide the item’s 
price into four equal payments, the last of which must be paid by the week of December 20.80 ■
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Discuss the relationships among pricing, 
image, competition, and value.
●Pricing decisions cut across every aspect of a small 
company, influencing everything from its marketing 
and sales efforts to its operations and strategy. 
A company’s pricing strategy is a major determinant 
of its image in the marketplace, is influenced by the 
pricing strategies of its competitors, and is an im-
portant element in the value that customers perceive
its products or services provide.

●Ultimately, the “right” price for a product or service 
depends on one factor: the value it provides for a cus-
tomer. For most shoppers, three reference points define 
a fair price: the price they have paid for the product or 
service in the past, the prices competitors charge for 
the same or similar product or service, and the costs a
company incurs to provide the product or service.
2. Describe effective pricing techniques for 
introducing new products or services and for 
existing ones.
●Pricing a new product is often difficult for business 
owners, but it should accomplish three objectives: 
getting the product accepted, maintaining market 
share as the competition grows, and earning a profit. 
Generally, three major pricing strategies are used to 
introduce new products into the market: penetration, 
skimming, and life cycle.
●Pricing techniques for existing products and services
include odd pricing, price lining, dynamic pricing,
leader pricing, geographic pricing, discounts, mul-
tiple unit pricing, bundling, optional product pricing,
captive product pricing, by-product pricing, sug-
gested retail pricing, and follow-the-leader pricing.
3. Explain the pricing methods and strategies for 
retailers, manufacturers, and service firms.
●Pricing for the retailer means pricing to move mer-
chandise. Markup is the difference between the cost 
of a product or service and its selling price. Most 
retailers compute their markup as a percentage of 
retail price.
●A manufacturer’s pricing decision depends on the 
support of accurate cost accounting records. The 
most common technique is cost-plus pricing, in 
which the manufacturer charges a price that cov-
ers the cost of producing a product plus a reason-
able profit. Every manufacturer should calculate a 
product’s break-even price, the price that produces 
neither a profit nor a loss.
●Service firms often suffer from the effects of vague, 
unfounded pricing procedures and frequently charge 
the going rate without any idea of their costs. A
service firm must set a price on the basis of the cost 
of materials used, labor involved, overhead, and a 
profit. The proper price reflects the total cost of pro-
viding a unit of service.
4. Describe the impact of credit on pricing.
●Offering consumer credit enhances a small compa-
ny’s reputation and increases the probability, speed,
and magnitude of customers’ purchases. Small
firms offer three types of consumer credit: credit 
cards, installment credit, and trade credit (charge 
accounts).

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Fashioning a well-designed financial plan as part of a comprehensive business plan is one of 
the most important steps to launching a new business venture. Entrepreneurs who fail to develop 
workable strategies for earning a profit from the outset eventually suffer the ultimate business 
penalty: failure. In addition, potential lenders and investors demand a realistic financial plan 
before putting their money into a start-up company. More important, a financial plan is a vital 
tool that helps entrepreneurs to manage their businesses more effectively, steering their way 
around the pitfalls that cause failures. Proper financial management requires putting in place
a system that provides entrepreneurs with relevant financial information in an easy-to-read and 
readily understandable format on a timely basis. It allows entrepreneurs to know not only how
their businesses are doing financially but also why their companies are performing that way. The 
information in a small company’s financial records is one resource to which competitors have no 
access. Smart entrepreneurs recognize this and put their companies’ numbers to work for them 
so that they can make their businesses more successful. Understanding financial statements and
other accounting records can help alert entrepreneurs to emerging problems in their businesses,
help them trim costs, and offer clues on how to boost profits.1
Unfortunately, failure to collect and analyze basic financial data is a common mistake among 
entrepreneurs. A recent survey by Sage North America reports that about one in five small busi-
ness owners lacks sufficient financial literacy to identify the cost that has the greatest impact on 
a company.2 A study by the National Federation of Independent Business reports that 79 percent 
of small business owners have no plans to provide their employees with financial training.3 Both
research and anecdotal evidence suggest that a significant percentage of entrepreneurs run their 
companies without any kind of financial plan and never analyze their companies’ financial state-
ments as part of the decision-making process. Bill Hettinger, business consultant and author of 
Finance without Fear, estimates that 75 percent of business owners do not understand or fail to 
focus on the financial details of their companies.4 To reach profit objectives, entrepreneurs must 
be aware of their companies’ overall financial position and the changes in financial status that 
occur over time. Most accounting experts advise entrepreneurs to use one of the popular com-
puterized small business accounting programs such as QuickBooks, Xero, and others to manage
routine record-keeping tasks. More than three-quarters (77 percent) of small business owners use 
accounting software to help track revenues and expenses.5 Working with an accountant to set up 
the system at the outset and then having an employee or a bookkeeping service enter the transac-
tions is most efficient for most businesses. These programs make preparing reports, analyzing a 
company’s financial statements, and summarizing data a snap. Studies show that business owners 
who use accounting software are more likely to be financially literate than those who do not.6
This chapter focuses on some practical tools that help entrepreneurs to develop a workable 
financial plan, keep them aware of their company’s financial performance, and enable them to plan 
for profit. They can use these tools to help them anticipate changes and plot an appropriate profit 
strategy to meet these shifts head-on. These profit-planning techniques are not difficult to master, 
nor are they overly time consuming. We will discuss the techniques involved in preparing projected 
(pro forma) financial statements, conducting ratio analysis, and performing break-even analysis.
Basic Financial Statements
Before we begin building projected financial statements, it would be helpful to review the basic 
financial reports that measure a company’s financial position: the balance sheet, the income state-
ment, and the statement of cash flows. The level of financial sophistication among small business
owners may not be high, but the extent of financial reporting among small businesses is. Most 
small businesses regularly produce summary financial information, almost all of it in the form of 
these traditional financial statements.
The Balance Sheet
Like a digital camera, the balance sheet takes a “snapshot” of a business’s financial position,
providing owners with an estimate of its worth on a given date. Its two major sections show the 
assets the business owns and the claims creditors and owners have against those assets. The bal-
ance sheet is usually prepared on the last day of the month. Figure 11.1 shows the balance sheet 
for Sam’s Appliance Shop for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The balance sheet is built on the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities +
Owner’s equity. Any increase or decrease on one side of the equation must be offset by an in-
crease or decrease on the other side, hence the name balance sheet. It provides a baseline from 
which to measure future changes in assets, liabilities, and equity. The first section of the balance 
sheet lists the company’s assets (valued at cost, not actual market value) and shows the total value
of everything the business owns. Current assets consist of cash and items to be converted into 
cash within one year or within the normal operating cycle of the company, whichever is longer, 
such as accounts receivable and inventory. Fixed assets are those acquired for long-term use 
in the business. Intangible assets include items such as goodwill, copyrights, and patents that, 
although valuable, are not tangible.
The second section shows the business’s liabilities—the creditors’ claims against the com-
pany’s assets. Current liabilities are those debts that must be paid within one year or within the 
normal operating cycle of the company, whichever is longer, and long-term liabilities are those

that come due after one year. This section of the balance sheet also shows the owner’s equity, the
value of the owner’s investment in the business. It is the balancing factor on the balance sheet, 
representing all of the owner’s capital contributions to the business plus all accumulated (or 
retained) earnings not distributed to the owner(s).
The Income Statement
The income statement (also called the profit-and-loss statement) compares expenses against 
revenue over a certain period of time to show the firm’s net income (or loss). Like a digital video
recorder, the income statement is a “moving picture” of a company’s profitability over time. 
The annual income statement reports the bottom line of the business over the fiscal or calendar 
year. Figure 11.2 shows the income statement for Sam’s Appliance Shop for the year ended 
December 31, 2015.
To calculate net income or loss, an entrepreneur records sales revenues for the year, which in-
cludes all income that flows into the business from sales of goods and services. Income from other

investment in the business.

sources (rent, investments, and interest) also must be included in the revenue section of the income
statement. To determine net sales revenue, owners subtract the value of returned items and refunds 
from gross revenue. Cost of goods sold represents the total cost, including shipping, of the mer-
chandise sold during the accounting period. Manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers calculate cost 
of goods sold by adding purchases to beginning inventory and subtracting ending inventory. Ser-
vice-providing companies typically have no cost of goods sold because they do not carry inventory.
Subtracting the cost of goods sold from net sales revenue results in a company’s gross profit. 
Allowing the cost of goods sold to get out of control whittles away a company’s gross profit and 
threatens its ability to generate positive net income because a company must pay all of its operat-
ing expenses out of its gross profit. Dividing gross profit by net sales revenue produces the gross 
profit margin, a ratio that every small business owner should watch closely. If a company’s gross 
profit margin slips too low, it is likely that it will operate at a loss (negative net income). A busi-
ness that operates at a gross profit margin of 50 percent must generate $2 in sales for every $1 of 
operating expenses just to break even. However, a company with a 10 percent gross profit margin 
must generate $10 in sales for every $1 of operating expenses to reach its break-even point.
Many business owners whose companies are losing money mistakenly believe that the prob-
lem is inadequate sales volume; therefore, they focus on pumping up sales at any cost. In many 
cases, however, the losses their companies are incurring are the result of an inadequate gross 
profit margin, and pumping up sales only deepens their losses! Repairing a poor gross profit 
margin requires a company to raise prices, cut manufacturing or purchasing costs, refuse orders 
with low profit margins, “fire” unprofitable customers (see Figure 11.3), or add new products 
with more attractive profit margins. Increasing sales will not resolve the problem. Monitoring the 
gross profit margin over time and comparing it to those of other companies in the same industry 
are important steps to maintaining a company’s long-term profitability.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Paul Spiegelman: Stericycle Stericycle, a medi-
cal waste company headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, is a company that relies on
a fundamental set of beliefs to drive how its business operates. The core values that guide 
Stericycle’s culture include accountability to its customers, teamwork in pursuit of a com-
mon goal, customers first, continuous improvement, and a strong sense of camaraderie and 
enjoying work. Paul Spiegelman, Chief Culture Officer of Stericycle, says that if the com-
pany’s clients don’t share these values, the result is a significant negative impact on the 
company’s culture. The founders landed a multi-million-dollar client that shared the values 
on which they founded the business, but over time the client’s priorities shifted from cus-
tomer service to maximizing its sales. The client began to provide services its customers did 
not ask for, adding unwanted items to their monthly bills. Despite the negative impact on
the company’s profits, Stericycle terminated the contract with the client. Employees were 
pleased to know that Stericycle delivered on its commitment to the customer and sent let-
ters to management thanking them for acting with integrity.7 ■
Operating expenses include those costs that contribute directly to the manufacturing 
and distribution of goods. General expenses are indirect costs incurred in operating the 
business. “Other expenses” is a catchall category covering all other expenses that don’t 
fit into the other two categories. Subtracting total expenses from total revenue gives the 
company’s net income (or loss) for the accounting period. Reducing expenses increases a 
company’s net income, and even small reductions in expenses can add up to big savings.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Wesley Hutchen: Oak Environmental Wesley Hutchen,
owner of Oak Environmental, an environmental remediation rental company based in
Calgary, Alberta, switched from tracking its equipment by hand to an automated bar-code system 
that dramatically increased the accuracy of the company’s rental records. Although implementing
the new system required three months, error rates fell from 20 percent to less than 2 percent, and 
employees cut in half the time spent tracking equipment. According to Hutchen, the automated 
system saves $50,000 a year in costs and allows the company to generate $36,000 more per year in 
equipment rental revenue.8 ■

High
A classic study reports that 20 percent of the typical company’s customers are unprofitable.  Many business owners who take
the time to analyze their customer bases are surprised to discover that some of the customers they thought were profitable
actually are costing their companies money.  The solution: Raise prices or fees, or “fire” the unprofitable customers. 
The following customer profitability map helps entrepreneurs identify which of their customers are best – and worst – for
their businesses.
Methodology: Select your biggest customers and assign each one a “resonance score” from 1 (difficult) to 10 (easy) that
reflects how easy they are to serve.  Then calculate the profit margin (profit as a percentage of sales) your company makes from
each customer.  Plot each customer’s score on the map as a circle.  The size of the circle should be proportionate to the
percentage of the company’s total sales for which the customer accounts.  The result is a map that shows how your company’s
customers fall into each of the 4 quadrants.

goals. “Numbers run companies,” says Norm Brodsky, serial entrepreneur and owner of Citi-
Storage, a successful storage company based in New York City. “It’s your responsibility as an
owner to know and understand not only the income statement but also the balance sheet of your 
business. You ignore them at your peril.”9
The Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows show the changes in a company’s working capital from the begin-
ning of the accounting period by listing both the sources of funds and the uses of those funds. 
Many small businesses never need to prepare such a statement; instead, they rely on a cash 
budget, a less formal managerial tool you will learn about in Chapter 12 that tracks the flow of 
cash into and out of a company over time. Sometimes, however, creditors, lenders, investors, or 
business buyers may require this information.
To prepare the statement, owners must assemble the balance sheet and the income statement 
summarizing the present year’s operations. They begin with the company’s net income for the 
period (from the income statement). Then they add the sources of the company’s funds: borrowed

funds, owner contributions, decreases in accounts receivable, increases in accounts payable,
decreases in inventory, depreciation, and any others. Depreciation is listed as a source of funds 
because it is a noncash expense that has already been deducted as a cost of doing business. 
Because the owner has already paid for the item being depreciated, however, its depreciation is a 
source of funds. Next the owner subtracts the uses of these funds: plant and equipment purchases,
dividends to owners, repayment of debt, increases in accounts receivable, decreases in accounts 
payable, increases in inventory, and so on. The difference between the total sources and the total 
uses is the increase or decrease in working capital. By investigating the changes in their com-
panies’ working capital and the reasons for them, owners can create a more practical financial 
action plan for the future of the enterprise.
These financial statements are more than just complex documents used only by accountants 
and financial officers. When used in conjunction with the analytical tools described in the fol-
lowing sections, they can help entrepreneurs to map a firm’s financial future and actively plan 
for profit. Mere preparation of these statements is not enough, however; owners and employees 
must understand and use the information contained in them to make the business more effective 
and efficient.
Creating Projected Financial Statements
Creating projected financial statements helps entrepreneurs to transform their business goals into 
reality. These projected financial statements answer questions such as the following: What profit 
can the business expect to earn? If the owner’s profit objective is x dollars, what sales level must 
x
the company achieve? What fixed and variable expenses can the owner expect at that level of 
sales? The answers to these and other questions are critical in formulating a functional financial 
plan for the small business.
This section focuses on creating projected income statements and balance sheets for a small
start-up. These projected (or pro forma) statements are a crucial component of every business plan 
because they estimate the profitability and the overall financial condition of a company in the fu-
ture. They are an integral part of convincing potential lenders and investors to provide the financing 
needed to get the company off the ground (the topic of Chapter 13). In addition, because these state-
ments project a company’s financial position through the end of the forecasted period, they help 
entrepreneurs to plan the route to improved financial strength and healthy business growth. To be 
useful, however, these forecasts must be realistic and well researched! Entrepreneurs typically find
that revenues are the most difficult to forecast. However, even though estimating future revenues is 
challenging, the accuracy of these forecasts can make or break a business as it grows.
Because an established business has a history of operating data from which to construct pro-
jected financial statements, the task is not nearly as difficult as it is for a start-up company. When 
creating pro forma financial statements for a business start-up, entrepreneurs typically rely on pub-
lished statistics that summarize the operation of similar-size companies in the same industry. These 
statistics are available from a number of sources (described later), but this section draws on in-
formation found in the Annual Statement Studies, a compilation of financial data collected from
250,000 companies across more than 760 industries organized by Standard Industrial Classification 
(SIC) Code and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) published by the Risk 
Management Association (RMA). Because conditions and markets change so rapidly, entrepreneurs
developing financial forecasts for start-ups should focus on creating projections for two years into
the future. Although these sources offer guidelines to gauge how reasonable a company’s projections 
are, entrepreneurs should use values that apply to their own particular circumstances to derive their 
forecasts. Remember that any published financial data is based on operating businesses. For a start-
up company, the key is accurate forecasts that show how the business will get to these industry stan-
dards. Investors want to see that entrepreneurs have developed well-researched, realistic expectations 
about their companies’ income and expenses and when they expect to start earning a profit.
Projected Financial Statements for a Small Business
One of the most important tasks confronting the entrepreneur launching a new enterprise is to 
determine the amount of funding required to begin operation as well as the amount required to
keep the company going until it begins to generate positive cash flow. The amount of money

forma) financial statements.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
needed to begin a business depends on the type of operation, its location, inventory requirements, 
sales volume, and many other factors. Every new firm must have enough capital to cover all 
start-up costs, including funds to rent or buy plant, equipment, and tools, and to pay for advertis-
ing, wages, licenses, utilities, and other expenses. In addition, an entrepreneur must maintain a
reserve of capital to carry the company until it begins to generate positive cash flow. Too often, 
entrepreneurs are overly optimistic in their financial plans and fail to recognize that expenses 
initially exceed income (and cash outflow exceeds cash inflow) for most small firms. This period 
of net losses (and negative cash flow) is normal and may last from just a few months to several 
years. During this time, entrepreneurs must be able to pay the company’s regular bills, meet pay-
roll, purchase inventory, take advantage of cash discounts, pay the company’s regular bills, grant 
customers credit, and meet their personal financial obligations.
THE PROJECTED INCOME STATEMENT When creating a projected income statement, the first 
step is to create a sales forecast. An entrepreneur has two options: to develop a sales forecast 
and work down or to set a profit target and work up. Developing a realistic sales forecast for a
business start-up is not always easy, but with creativity and research it is possible. Talking with
owners of existing businesses in the industry (outside of the local trading area, of course) can
provide meaningful insight into the sales levels a company can expect to generate during its early 
years. For a reasonable fee, entrepreneurs can access published aggregated financial statistics that 
industry trade associations collect on the companies in their industries. Other organizations, such
as the Risk Management Association and Dun & Bradstreet, publish useful financial information 
for a wide range of industries. Internet searches and trips to the local library will produce the 
necessary information. Interviews with potential customers and test-marketing an actual product 
or service also can reveal the number of customers a company can expect to attract. One method
for checking the accuracy of a sales estimate is to calculate the revenue other companies in the 
same industry generate per employee and compare it to your own projected revenue per employee. 
A value that is out of line with industry standards is not likely to be realistic. Experienced investors 
will expect any sales forecasts to be clearly explained by a sound marketing plan.
Many entrepreneurs prefer the second method of creating a projected income statement,
targeting a profit figure and then “working up” to determine the sales level they must achieve to 
reach it. Of course, it is important to compare this sales target against the results of the market-
ing plan to determine whether it is realistic. Once an entrepreneur determines a reasonable profit 
target, the next step is to estimate the expenses the business will incur to generate that profit.
The profit a small company produces must be large enough to provide a reasonable return on 
the time the owners spend operating the business and a return on their investment in the business.
Entrepreneurs who earn less in their own businesses than they could earn working for someone
else must weigh carefully the advantages and disadvantages of choosing the path of entrepreneur-
ship. Why be exposed to all of the risks, sacrifices, and hard work of beginning and operating a
small business if the rewards are less than those of remaining in the secure employment of another?
Although there are many nonfinancial benefits of owning a business, the net income a company
generates should be at least as much as an entrepreneur could earn by working for someone else.
An adequate profit must also include a reasonable return on the owner’s total investment in
the business. (The owner’s total investment is the amount contributed to the company plus any 
retained earnings from previous years that were funneled back into the business.) In other words,
an entrepreneur’s target income is the sum of a reasonable salary for the time spent running the 
business and a normal return on the amount invested in the company. Determining this amount is
the first step in creating the projected income statement.
An entrepreneur then must translate this target profit into a net sales figure for the forecasted 
period. To calculate net sales from a target profit, the entrepreneur can use published industry 
statistics. Suppose an entrepreneur wants to launch a small retail comic book store and has deter-
mined that his target net income is $30,000. Statistics gathered from BizMiner’s Startup Profit 
and Loss Profile show that the typical comic book store’s net profit margin (Net profit ÷ Net 
sales) is 12.7 percent. Using this information, he can compute the sales level required to produce 
a net profit of $30,000:
Net profif t margin =
Net income
Sales (annual)

CHAPTER 11 • CREATING A SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL PLAN
429
Solving for net sales produces the following result:
Net sales = $30,000
0.127
= $236,220
Now the entrepreneur knows that to make a net profit of $30,000 (before taxes), he or she 
must achieve annual sales of $236,220. To complete the projected income statement, the owner 
simply applies the appropriate statistics from the Startup Profit and Loss Profile to the annual 
sales figure. Because the statistics for each income statement item are expressed as percentages
of net sales, the entrepreneur merely multiplies the proper percentage by the annual sales figure 
to obtain the desired value. For example, cost of goods sold usually makes up 60.23 percent of net 
sales for the typical comic book store; therefore, the owner of this new comic book store expects 
his cost of goods sold to be the following:
Cost of goods sold = $236,220 × 0.6023 = $142,275
The comic book store’s complete projected income statement is shown as follows:

(100%)
$236,220
−Cost of goods sold
(60.23%)
$142,275
Gross profit margin
(39.77%)
$ 93,945
−Operating expenses
(27.07%)
$ 63,945
Net profit (before taxes)
(12.7%)
 $30,000
At this point, the business appears to be a viable venture. However, remember that this income 
statement represents a sales goal the owner may not be able to reach. The next step is to deter
l
-
mine whether this required sales volume is reasonable. One useful technique is to break down
the required annual sales volume into daily sales figures. Assuming that the store will be open six
days per week for 52 weeks (312 days), we see that the owner must average $757 per day in sales:
Average daily sales = $236,220
312 days = $757/day
This calculation gives the owner a better perspective of the sales required to yield an annual profit 
of $30,000.
To determine whether the profit expected from the business will meet or exceed the target 
income, the entrepreneur also should use this same process to create income statements that are 
built on pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic sales estimates. The previous analysis shows an 
entrepreneur the sales level needed to reach a desired profit. But what happens if sales are lower? 
Higher? Making these projections requires a reliable sales forecast using the market research 
techniques described in Chapter 8.
Suppose, for example, that after conducting research on the industry, a marketing survey of 
local customers, and discussions with owners of comic book stores in other markets, the prospec-
tive entrepreneur projects annual sales for the proposed business’s first year of operation to be 
only $210,000. The entrepreneur can take this sales estimate and develop a projected income
statement:
Net sales
(100%)
$210,000
−Cost of goods sold
(60.23%)
$126,483
Gross profit margin
(39.77%)
$ 83,517
−Operating expenses
(27.07%)
$ 56,847
Net profit (before taxes)
(12.7%)
 $26,670
Based on sales of $210,000, this entrepreneur can expect a net income (before taxes) of $26,670. 
If this amount is acceptable as a return on the investment of time and money in the business, the 
entrepreneur should proceed with his or her planning.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
At this stage in developing the financial plan, the owner should create a more detailed picture of the 
venture’s expected operating expenses. In addition to gathering information from industry trade asso-
ciations about typical operating expenses, an entrepreneur can contact potential vendors, suppliers, and
providers to get estimates of the expenses he or she can expect to incur in his or her area of operation. 
One entrepreneur who was preparing a business plan for the launch of an upscale women’s clothing 
store contacted local utility companies, insurance agencies, radio and television stations, newspapers, 
and other vendors to get estimates of her utility, insurance, advertising, and other expenses.
To ensure that they have not overlooked any business expenses in preparing the business
plan, entrepreneurs should list all of the expenses they will incur and have an accountant review 
the list. Sometimes in their estimates of expenses, entrepreneurs neglect to include salaries for 
themselves, immediately raising a “red flag” among lenders and investors. Without drawing a sal-
ary, how will an entrepreneur pay his or her own bills? At the other extreme, lenders and investors 
frown on exorbitantly high salaries for owners of business start-ups. Typically, salaries are not the 
best use of cash in a start-up; one guideline is to draw a salary that is about 25 to 30 percent below 
the market rate for a similar position (and to make adjustments from there if conditions warrant).
In addition, as the company grows, executive salaries should be among the last expenses to be
t
increased. Reinvesting the extra money in the company accelerates its growth rate.
THE PROJECTED BALANCE SHEET In addition to projecting a start-up’s net profit or loss, an entre-
preneur must develop a pro forma balance sheet outlining the fledgling firm’s assets and liabilities.
Most entrepreneurs’ primary concern is profitability because, on the surface, the importance of 
a business’s assets is less obvious. In many cases, small companies begin their lives on weak 
financial footing because entrepreneurs fail to determine their firms’ total asset requirements. To
prevent this major oversight, entrepreneurs should prepare a projected balance sheet listing every
asset their businesses will need and all the claims against these assets.
ASSETS Cash is one of the most useful assets the business owns; it is highly liquid and can quickly 
be converted into other tangible assets. But how much cash should a small business have at its 
inception? Obviously, there is no single dollar figure that fits the needs of every small firm. One 
practical rule of thumb, however, suggests that a company’s cash balance should cover its operating 
expenses (less depreciation, a noncash expense) for at least one inventory turnover period. Using 
this guideline, we can calculate the cash balance for the small comic book store as follows:
Operating expenses = $56,847 (from projected income statement)
Less depreciation (1.24% of annual sales*) of $2,604 (a noncash expense)
Equals: cash expenses (annual) = $54,243
Annual inventory turnover ratio* = 4.6 times per year
Cash requirement =
Cash expenses
Average inventory turnover
= $54,243
4.6
= $11,792
*From BizMiner, Startup Profit and Loss Profile.
Notice the inverse relationship between the small firm’s average turnover ratio and its cash re-
quirement. The higher the number of inventory turns a company generates, the lower its cash 
requirement. For instance, if this florist could turn its inventory eight times per year, its cash 
requirement would be $54,243 ÷ 8 = $6,780.
Another decision facing the entrepreneur is how much inventory the business should carry. 
A rough estimate of the inventory requirement can be calculated from the information found on
the projected income statement and from published statistics:
Cost of goods sold = $126,483 (from projected income statement)
Average inventory turnover =
Cost of goods sold
Average inventory level = 4.6 times/year

CHAPTER 11 • CREATING A SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL PLAN
431
Rearranging the equation to solve for inventory level produces the following:
Average inventory level =
$126,483
4.6 times/year
Average inventory level = $27,496
The entrepreneur also includes $1,800 in miscellaneous current assets.
The estimate of fixed assets is as follows:
Fixtures
$14,500
Office equipment
5,250
Computers/cash register
5,125
Signs
7,200
Miscellaneous
1,500
Total
$33,575
LIABILITIES To complete the projected balance sheet, the owner must record all of the small firm’s 
liabilities, the claims that creditors have against its assets. The comic book store owner was able 
to finance 50 percent of the inventory and fixtures ($20,998) through suppliers and has a short-
term note payable in the amount of $3,750. The only other major claim against the firm’s assets
is a note payable to the entrepreneur’s father-in-law for $25,000. The difference between the 
company’s assets ($74,592) and its total liabilities ($49,748) represents the owner’s investment 
in the business (owner’s equity) of $24,844.
The final step is to compile all of these items into a projected balance sheet, as shown in 
Figure 11.4.

Would you be willing to drive a car on an extended trip without being able to see the dashboard 
displays showing fuel level, engine temperature, oil pressure, battery status, or the speed at 
which you were traveling? Not many people would! Yet many small business owners run their 
companies exactly that way. They never take the time to check the vital signs of their businesses
using their “financial dashboards.” The result: their companies develop engine trouble, fail, 
and leave them stranded along the road to successful entrepreneurship. To avoid becoming a 
failure statistic, entrepreneurs must understand the numbers that drive their businesses. Norm

statements and the specific numbers that they must watch closely to ensure their companies’
success. By watching the numbers over time, successful entrepreneurs learn to identify patterns 
that can signal problems in their businesses.10
Smart entrepreneurs know that once they have their businesses up and running with the 
help of a solid financial plan, the next step is to keep their companies moving in the right 
direction with the help of proper financial controls. Establishing these controls—and using them 
consistently—is one of the keys to keeping a business vibrant and healthy. A sound system of 
financial controls serves as an early warning device for underlying problems that could destroy 
a young business. A company’s financial accounting and reporting systems help signal entrepre-
neurs that their businesses are experiencing declining profits, increasing overhead expenses, and 
growing inventories or accounts receivable. All of these changes have a negative impact on cash 
flow, the lifeblood of every business. As cash flow suffers, entrepreneurs may struggle to pay 
vendors, may not be able to order enough raw materials and hire enough workers, and may not be 
able to maintain equipment properly. To avoid these problems, entrepreneurs must tune into the 
signals that their businesses send about their performance.
What are these signals, and how does an entrepreneur go about tracking and focusing on 
these them One extremely helpful tool is ratio analysis. Ratio analysis, a method of expressing 
the relationships between any two elements on financial statements, provides a convenient tech-
nique for performing financial analysis. When analyzed properly, ratios serve as barometers of a 
company’s financial health. “You owe it to yourself to understand each ratio and what it means 
to your business,” says one accountant. “Ratios point out potential trouble areas so you can 
correct them before they multiply.”11 Ratio analysis allows entrepreneurs to determine whether 
their companies are carrying excessive inventory, experiencing heavy operating expenses, over-
extending credit, taking on too much debt, and managing to pay their bills on time and to answer 
other questions relating to the efficient and effective operation of the overall business. Unfor-
tunately, few business owners actually compute financial ratios and use them to manage their 
businesses.
Smart business owners use financial ratio analysis to identify problems in their businesses
while they are still problems and not business-threatening crises. Tracking these ratios over time 
permits an owner to spot a variety of red flags that are indications of these problem areas. This is 
critical to business success because business owners cannot solve problems they do not know ex-
ist! Business owners also can use ratio analysis to increase the likelihood of obtaining loans. By 
analyzing their financial statements with ratios, business owners can anticipate potential prob-
lems and identify important strengths in advance. Lenders and investors use ratios to analyze the
financial statements of companies looking for financing, comparing them against industry aver-
ages and looking for trends over time.
How many ratios should an entrepreneur monitor to maintain adequate financial control over 
a business? The number of ratios that an owner could calculate is limited only by the number of 
accounts on a firm’s financial statements. However, tracking too many ratios only creates confu-
sion and saps the meaning from an entrepreneur’s financial analysis. The secret to successful ra-
tio analysis is simplicity, focusing on just enough ratios to provide a clear picture of a company’s 
financial standing.
Twelve Key Ratios
In keeping with the idea of simplicity, we will describe 12 key ratios that enable most business
owners to monitor their companies’ financial positions without becoming bogged down in finan-
cial details. This section presents explanations of these ratios and examples based on the balance
sheet and the income statement for Sam’s Appliance Shop shown in Figure 11.1 and Figure 11.2. 
We will group them into four categories: liquidity ratios, leverage ratios, operating ratios, and 
profitability ratios.
LIQUIDITY RATIOS Liquidity ratios tell whether a small business will be able to meet its short-
term financial obligations as they come due. These ratios forewarn a business owner of impending
cash flow problems. A small company with solid liquidity not only is able to pay its bills on time
but also has enough cash to take advantage of attractive business opportunities as they arise.
Liquidity ratios measure a company’s ability to convert its assets to cash quickly and without a

loss of value to pay its short-term liabilities. The primary measures of liquidity are the current 
ratio and the quick ratio.
1. Current Ratio. The current ratio measures a small firm’s solvency by indicating its ability to 
pay current liabilities (debts) from current assets. It is calculated in the following manner:
Current ratio =
Current assets
Current liabilities
= $686,985
$367,850
= 1.87:1
Sam’s Appliance Shop has $1.87 in current assets for every $1 it has in current liabilities.
Current assets are those that an owner expects to convert into cash in the ordinary business 
cycle and normally include cash, notes/accounts receivable, inventory, and any other short-term 
marketable securities. Current liabilities are those short-term obligations that come due within 
one year and include notes/accounts payable, taxes payable, and accruals.
The current ratio is sometimes called the working capital ratio and is the most commonly
used measure of short-term solvency. Typically, financial analysts suggest that a small business 
maintain a current ratio of at least 2:1 (i.e., $2 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities)
to maintain a comfortable cushion of working capital. Generally, the higher a company’s current 
ratio, the stronger its financial position; however, a high current ratio does not guarantee that a 
company is using its assets in the most profitable manner. For example, a business may have an
abundance of accounts receivable (many of which may not even be collectible) or may be over-
investing in inventory.
With its current ratio of 1.87, Sam’s Appliance Shop could liquidate its current assets at 
53.5 percent (1 ÷ 1.87 = 53.5%) of its book value and still manage to pay its current creditors 
in full.
2. Quick Ratio. The current ratio sometimes can be misleading because it does not reflect the 
quality of a company’s current assets. As we have already seen, a company with a large number 
of past-due receivables and stale inventory could boast an impressive current ratio and still be on 
the verge of financial collapse. The quick ratio (sometimes called the acid test ratio) is a more 
conservative measure of a company’s liquidity because it shows the extent to which its most 
liquid assets cover its current liabilities. This ratio includes only a company’s “quick assets”—
those assets that a company can convert into cash immediately if needed—and excludes the most 
illiquid asset of all, inventory. It is calculated as follows:
Quick ratio =
Quick assets
Current liabilities
= $686,985 - $455,455
$367,850
= 0.63:1
Sam’s Appliance Shop has 63 cents in quick assets for every $1 of current liabilities.
The quick ratio is a more rigorous test of a company’s liquidity. It measures a 
company’s capacity to pay its current debts if all sales income ceased immediately. 
Generally, a quick ratio of 1:1 is considered satisfactory. A ratio of less than 1:1, as 
is the case with Sam’s Appliance Shop, indicates that the small firm is dependent 
on inventory and on future sales to satisfy short-term debt. A quick ratio of greater 
than 1:1 indicates a greater degree of financial security.

previous start-ups. He underestimated the time and expense required to develop the software 
products for his first company but was able to raise more funding and eventually sell the com-
pany to Cisco Systems. In his second company, in which he was an investor and board member, 
the outcome was not as happy. Two large customers were unable to pay their bills after they were 
hit hard by the credit crisis of 2008, which forced Knitowski’s company into bankruptcy. In his 
third start-up, Phunware, Knitowski implemented several practices to ensure effective financial
and cash management. Every Friday, Phunware’s controller e-mails cash on hand, current ac-
counts payable, and the company’s quick ratio to the entire management team, which analyzes
the financial data to identify any troublesome trends. If the key financial metrics are trending in 
the wrong direction, managers identify the reason and take quick corrective actions. The team 
pays particular attention to accounts receivable to determine whether any customers are paying 
too slowly and what actions might be necessary as a result of any late payments. Managers moni-
tor cash on hand using a color-coded system. If the company has at least 18 months of cash on 
hand, managers see a greenbar. If cash on hand would cover 12 to 18 months of expenses, the 
cash on hand figure is coded yellow, and managers immediately begin to evaluate debt and eq-
uity funding sources to improve Phunware’s cash position. They do not wait until the company’s 
cash on hand drops too low to act. The company has never dropped below 12 months of cash on 
hand, which would be coded red.13 ■
LEVERAGE RATIOS Leverage ratios measure the financing supplied by a firm’s owners against 
that supplied by its creditors; they are a gauge of the depth of a company’s debt. These ratios
show the extent to which an entrepreneur relies on debt capital (rather than equity capital) to
finance the business. They also provide a measure of the degree of financial risk in a company.
Generally, small businesses with low leverage ratios are less affected by economic downturns, but 
the returns for these firms are lower during economic booms. Conversely, small companies with 
high leverage ratios are more vulnerable to economic slides because their debt loads demolish 
cash flow; however, they have greater potential for large profits.
Today, 33 percent of small businesses rely on bank loans, a decrease from 50 percent of 
small companies in 2008. This decline is due to the reduction in available bank credit for small 
businesses since the financial crisis of 2008. During that same time period, small business owners
have looked toward loans from family and friends to meet their borrowing needs. Small business
use of private loans from family and friends increased from 12 percent to 17 percent over that 
d
same time period.12 Debt is a powerful financial tool, whatever its source, but companies must 
handle it carefully—just as a demolitionist handles dynamite. Like dynamite, too much debt can 
be deadly. Unfortunately, some companies push their debt loads beyond the safety barrier and 
threaten their ability to survive. Heavy debt loads can be deadly, particularly when a company’s
sales or earnings falter, as often happens during economic downturns.
Managed carefully, however, debt can boost a company’s performance and improve its
productivity.
3. Debt Ratio. A small company’s debt ratio measures the percentage of total assets financed by 
its creditors compared to its owners. The debt ratio is calculated as follows:
Debit ratio = Total debt (or liabilities)
Total assets
= $367,850 + $212,150
$847,655
= 0.68:1
Creditors have claims of 68 cents against every $1 of assets that Sam’s Appliance Shop owns,
meaning that creditors have contributed twice as much to the company’s asset base as its
owners have.
Total debt includes all current liabilities and any outstanding long-term notes and bonds. Total 
assets represent the sum of the firm’s current assets, fixed assets, and intangible assets. A high debt 
ratio means that creditors provide a large percentage of a company’s total financing and, therefore,
bear most of its financial risk. Owners generally prefer higher leverage ratios; otherwise, business 
debt ratio
measures the percentage 
of total assets financed 
by a company’s creditors 
compared to its owners.

funds must come either from the owners’ personal assets or from taking on new owners, which 
means giving up more control over the business. In addition, with a greater portion of a firm’s as-
sets financed by creditors, the owner is able to generate profits with a smaller personal investment. 
Creditors, however, typically prefer moderate debt ratios because a lower debt ratio indicates a 
smaller chance of creditor losses in case of liquidation. To lenders and creditors, high debt ratios 
mean a higher risk of default.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Apax Partners and Cengage Learning In 2007 Apax 
Partners, a private equity firm, purchased Cengage Learning, an education textbook pub-
lisher, for $7.75 billion using $5 billion in debt financing. Due to the economic downturn that 
began in 2008 and to changes in the publishing industry, Cengage experienced a sharp decline in 
revenue and by 2012, was losing up to $2 billion a year. Cengage tried to renegotiate its debt but 
was unable to come to terms with its creditors. The company had a debt ratio of 0.96:1, which 
meant it had $0.96 in debt for every $1 in assets. The company entered into Chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy, which allowed it to continue operations and negotiate while it restructured its financing. 
After nine months in bankruptcy, the company emerged with a new debt structure. The bank-
ruptcy court gave creditors a majority of equity in the company in exchange for their credit claims
against the company. Cengage is pursuing a digital publishing business model, moving away from
print publishing, in an attempt to create a sustainable business model.14 ■
According to a senior analyst at Dun & Bradstreet’s Analytical Services, “If managed prop-
erly, debt can be beneficial because it’s a great way to have money working for you. You’re lever-
aging your assets, so you’re making more money than you’re paying out in interest.” However, 
excessive debt can be the downfall of a business. “As we pile up debt on our personal credit cards 
our lifestyles are squeezed,” he says. “The same thing happens to a business. Overpowering debt 
sinks thousands of businesses each year.”15
4. Debt-to-Net-Worth Ratio. A small company’s debt-to-net-worth (debt-to-equity) ratio
also expresses the relationship between the capital contributions from creditors and those from 
owners and measures how highly leveraged a company is. This ratio reveals a company’s capital 
structure by comparing what the business “owes” to “what it is worth.” It is a measure of a small
company’s ability to meet both its creditor and owner obligations in case of liquidation. The debt-
to-net-worth ratio is calculated as follows:
Debt@to@net worth ratio = Total debt (or liabilities)
Tangible net worth
= $367,850 + $212,150
$267,655 - $3,500
= 2.20:1
Sam’s Appliance Shop owes creditors $2.20 for every $1 of equity Sam owns.
Total debt is the sum of current liabilities and long-term liabilities, and tangible net worth 
represents the owners’ investment in the business (capital + capital stock + earned surplus +
retained earnings) less any intangible assets (e.g., goodwill) the firm owns.
The higher this ratio, the more leverage a business is using and the lower the degree of pro-
tection afforded creditors if the business should fail. A higher debt-to-net-worth ratio also means 
that the firm has less capacity to borrow; lenders and creditors see the firm as being “borrowed 
up.” Conversely, a low ratio typically is associated with a higher level of financial security, giving 
the business greater borrowing potential.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Charles Kuhn’s business, Kopp’s Cycle, is a part of bicycling his-
tory. E.C. Kopp founded Kopp’s Cycle in Princeton, New Jersey, in
1891. The Kopp family operated the business until the Kuhn family 
purchased it. Eventually Charles took over the store from his father
in the late 1970s. Celebrities from Albert Einstein to Brooke Shields 
purchased bicycles from Kopp’s Cycle. Legendary road racing cyclist
Greg LeMond was a customer from the time he was a junior racer.
Kopp’s Cycle looks like a typical bike shop. The front of the
retail store displays high-end bicycles and accessories. In the back 
of the store is a repair shop that looks the same as it did when
Kuhn’s father first purchased the business.
Charles Kuhn purchased the building that houses Kuhn’s 
Cycle in 2004 for about $800,000, which he financed with
a $775,000 loan secured by an SBA guarantee. Kuhn was not 
happy with SBA financing, however, because it came with sig-
nificant additional paperwork. In addition, the SBA loan had an 
adjustable rate, which worried him about the actual long-term 
cost of the loan and the uncertainty about payments as the inter-
est rate changed. As a result, Kuhn refinanced the loan through 
another bank that offered him a conventional fixed rate loan for 
$825,000. This new loan was not an SBA guaranteed loan, which 
pleased Kuhn. At the time of the refinancing, the building was
appraised at $1.3 million. Although the loan was amortized over 
25 years, it had a balloon payment of $775,000 due in three years. 
Balloon payments are a common feature of loans to small business 
owners. At the time of the balloon payment, the borrower must 
refinance, either with the current lender or with a new lender.
As it did with many small businesses, the economic down-
turn in 2008 hit Kopp’s Cycle hard. In addition, online sales of 
high-end bicycles were increasing significantly. Online retailers 
were able to offer prices that a small business like Kopp’s Cycle 
could not compete with due to its lower sales volume and higher 
overhead. Revenues dropped from $498,000 in 2008 to $393,000 
in 2009. Kuhn cut prices in 2010 to compete with online retailers,
which did bring his sales levels back up. However, the price cuts
resulted in profit margins dropping from 10 to 15 percent down
to 1 percent. To manage cash flow during this time, Kuhn relied 
on credit cards as a funding source for the business. He amassed 
credit card debt of more than $100,000.
Kuhn decided to seek new financing for his business. His plan 
was to borrow $1 million to pay off the $800,000 balance on
the building loan, pay off the credit card balances, and provide 
$100,000 in working capital to help manage cash flow. Kuhn esti-
mated that his building is now worth about $1.5 million, which he 
believed should be more than enough equity to support the loan.
The first bank Kuhn contacted about a loan declined to make a 
loan. After reviewing Kopp’s Cycle’s financial statements, the loan of-
ficer said Kopp’s Cycle’s debt coverage ratio, the ratio of monthly net
cash flow divided by debt payments, did not meet the bank’s mini-
mum of 1.1 to 1.5. With Kopp’s Cycle’s declining profit margins, it
could not meet the required debt coverage ratio. Bankers want to see 
a significant cushion in a company’s monthly cash flow to ensure that
even if the company’s financial position declines, it can maintain pay-
ments on the loan. The second bank Kuhn approached gave him the
same answer. A third banker did not even return Kuhn’s phone calls.
Kuhn then turned to a loan broker, who he paid an upfront
fee and who would take 10 percent of the loan amount once a
loan was closed. However, the bank the loan broker found for
Kuhn to talk with also passed on the loan, citing concerns over the
true market value of Kuhn’s building.
Although Kuhn did not believe that a new loan was essential
for the survival of the business, he did hope he could secure new 
financing to bolster Kopp’s Cycle’s financial position. In addition,
Kiuhn must address the balloon payment that is part of his current
building loan sooner or later. There was no guarantee that his cur-
rent bank would renew this loan, and he had not had much luck 
finding alternative financing.

CHAPTER 11 • CREATING A SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL PLAN
437
the 2008 economic downturn and a prolonged decline in advertising revenues, the Tribune Com-
pany filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On December 31, 2012, after four years in
bankruptcy, the Tribune Company emerged with its restructured financing in place. Before the
restructuring, the company had more than $13 billion in liabilities and a negative equity balance 
of –$8.27:1 billion, which produced a negative debt to equity ratio. Its debt-to-assets ratio was
2.1:1, which means it owed $2.10 in debt for every $1 in assets! After reorganization, the company 
had $5.75 billion in liabilities and an equity balance of $4.93 billion, which is a debt-to-equity ratio
of 1.16:1. Its debt-to-asset ratio improved to 0.50:1.16 ■
As a company’s debt-to-net-worth ratio approaches 1:1, the creditors’ interest in the business 
approaches that of the owners. If the ratio is greater than 1:1, as is still the case with the Tribune 
Company after reorganization, creditors’ claims exceed those of the owners, and the business 
may be undercapitalized. In other words, the owner has not supplied an adequate amount of 
capital, forcing the business to be overextended in terms of debt. Lenders become nervous when 
a company’s debt-to-equity ratio reaches 3:1 or more.
5. Times-Interest-Earned Ratio. The times-interest-earned ratio is a measure of a small
company’s ability to make the interest payments on its debt. It tells how many times a company’s 
earnings cover the interest payments on the debt it is carrying. This ratio measures the size of the 
cushion a company has in covering the interest cost of its debt load. The times-interest-earned 
ratio is calculated as follows:
Times interest earned ratio = Earnings befo
f re interest and taxes (or EBIT)
Total interest expense
= $60,629 + $39,850
$39,850
= 2.52:1
Sam’s Appliance Shop’s earnings are 2.5 times greater than its interest expense.
EBIT is the firm’s profit before deducting interest expense and taxes; the denominator 
measures the amount the business paid in interest over the accounting period. A high ratio sug-
gests that a company has little difficulty meeting the interest payments on its loans; creditors see
this as a sign of safety for future loans. Conversely, a low ratio is an indication that the company 
is overextended in its debts; earnings will not be able to cover its debt service if this ratio is 
less than one. Many banks look for a times-interest-earned ratio of at least 2:1, but some credi-
tors may want to see 4:1 to 6:1 before pronouncing a small company a good credit risk. Before 
Vicorp Restaurants Inc., the owner of Village Inn and Bakers Square restaurant chains, filed for 
bankruptcy, its times-interest-earned ratio had slipped from nearly 3:1 to just 1.85:1.17 Accord-
ing to a Pepperdine University survey of bankers, the top reason that business loans are denied is 
inadequate cash flow and profits.18
Although low to moderate levels of debt can boost a company’s financial performance, 
trouble looms on the horizon for businesses whose debt loads are so heavy that they must 
starve critical operations, research and development, customer service, and other vital areas 
just to pay interest on the debt. Because their interest payments are so large, highly leveraged 
companies find they are restricted when it comes to spending cash, whether on an acquisition, 
normal operations, or capital spending. Some entrepreneurs are so averse to debt that they run
their companies with little or no borrowing, relying instead on their business’s cash flow to 
finance growth.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jim Zamichieli: Zamolution When Jim Zamichieli started
his digital marketing company, Zamolution, he invested $20,000 in personal savings rather 
than borrow start-up capital. Zamichieli says he is more careful and thoughtful because it is his 
money at work in the business. The former corporate executive saw many companies founder 
when they took on too much debt, something he vows never to do, even though he admits that
his company could probably grow more rapidly if he used bank credit.19 ■

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
OPERATING RATIOS Operating ratios help an entrepreneur evaluate a small company’s overall 
performance and indicate how effectively the business employs its resources. The more effectively 
its resources are used, the less capital a small business will require. These five operating ratios are 
designed to help an entrepreneur spot those areas he or she must improve if his or her business 
is to remain competitive.
6. Average-Inventory-Turnover Ratio. A small firm’s average-inventory-turnover ratio mea-
sures the number of times its average inventory is sold out, or turned over, during the accounting 
period. This ratio tells the owner whether an entrepreneur is managing inventory properly. It 
indicates whether a business’s inventory is understocked, overstocked, or obsolete. The average-
inventory-turnover ratio is calculated as follows:
Average@inventory@turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold
Average inventory
=
$1,290,117
($805,745 + $455,455) , 2
= 2.05 times/year
Sam’ Appliance Shop turns its inventory about two times a year, or once every 178 days.
Average inventory is the sum of the value of the firm’s inventory at the beginning of the 
accounting period and its value at the end of the accounting period, divided by 2.
This ratio tells an entrepreneur how fast merchandise is moving through the business and
helps him or her to balance the company’s inventory on the fine line between oversupply and 
undersupply. To determine the average number of days units remain in inventory, the owner can 
divide the average-inventory-turnover ratio into the number of days in the accounting period
(e.g., 365 days ÷ average-inventory-turnover ratio). The result is called days’ inventory (or aver-
age age of inventory).
Auto dealerships often use the average age of inventory as a measure of their performance 
and consider 50 to 60 days’ worth of new cars to be an adequate inventory. Used car dealers’ goal 
is to have 35 to 45 days’ worth of used cars in inventory. Slow-turning inventory cannibalizes car 
dealers’ profitability because of the interest and other expenses they incur. Joseph Lescota, a retail 
automotive expert, says the ability to move inventory drives profits in his industry. At luxury new car 
dealerships, Lescota says the cost of holding a car in inventory can be as high as $90 per day; at the
typical used car dealership, the cost is $21 per day. If a used car dealership sells a car within 20 days,
it earns an average gross profit of $2,000. However, if that same car sits on the lot for 80 days before 
it sells, the average gross profit is just $740 (an occurrence known in the industry as “lot rot.”)
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jennifer Cattaui: Babesta Jennifer Cattaui, founder of 
Babesta in New York City, sells children’s clothing and furniture online and through two 
retail stores. Cattaui uses a financial dashboard that helps the Babesta management team moni-
tor the financial health of the business and make decisions based on financial data. The dash-
board gives the team metrics that assess cash balance, cash flow, inventory, and revenue. Babesta 
uses software that displays key metrics using a gauge. If the gauge is in the red zone, the team
digs deeper to find the cause. If it is in the green zone, the team knows that things are going well
for that specific financial aspect of the business. For example, when its inventory gauge was in the 
red, the management team assessed the company’s inventory and realized that they had furniture
in inventory that was not selling. After cutting back the number of those items in Babesta’s inven-
tory, the gauge soon returned to the green zone, telling management that inventory turnover
had returned to a satisfactory level.20 ■
An above-average inventory turnover indicates that the small business has a healthy, sal-
able, and liquid inventory and a supply of quality merchandise that is supported by sound pric-
ing policies. A below-average inventory turnover suggests an illiquid inventory characterized by 
obsolescence, overstocking, stale merchandise, and poor purchasing procedures. Businesses that 
turn their inventories more rapidly require a smaller inventory investment to produce a particu-
lar sales volume. That means that these companies tie up less cash in inventory that idly sits on 
shelves. For instance, if Sam’s could turn its inventory four times each year instead of just

the company would require an average inventory of just $322,529 instead of the current level of 
$630,600 to generate sales of $1,870,841. Increasing the number of inventory turns would free 
up more than $308,000 in cash currently tied up in excess inventory! Sam’s would benefit from 
improved cash flow and higher profits.
The inventory turnover ratio can be misleading, however. For example, an excessively high 
ratio could mean that a company does not have enough inventory on hand and may be losing sales 
because of stock-outs. Similarly, a low ratio could be the result of planned inventory stockpiling 
to meet seasonal peak demand. Another problem is that the ratio is based on an inventory balance 
calculated from two days out of the entire accounting period. Thus, inventory fluctuations due to 
seasonal demand patterns are ignored, and this may bias the resulting ratio. There is no universal, 
ideal inventory turnover ratio. Financial analysts suggest that a favorable turnover ratio depends 
on the type of business, its size, its profitability, its method of inventory valuation, and other rel-
evant factors. The most meaningful benchmark for comparison is other companies of similar size 
in the same industry. For instance, the typical supermarket turns its inventory on average about 
15 times a year, but a jewelry store averages just 1.5 to 2 inventory turns a year.
7. Average-Collection-Period Ratio. A small firm’s average-collection-period ratio (or days sales
outstanding [DSO]) tells the average number of days it takes to collect accounts receivable. To 
compute the average-collection-period ratio, an entrepreneur must first calculate the company’s 
receivables turnover. Given that Sam’s credit sales for the year were $1,309,589 (out of the total
t
sales of $1,870,841), the company’s receivables turnover ratio is as follows:
Receivables turnover ratio =
Credit sales
Accounts receivable
= $1,309,589
$179,225
= 7.31 times/year
Sam’s Appliance Shop turns over its receivables 7.31 times per year. This ratio measures the num-
ber of times the firm’s accounts receivable turn over during the accounting period. The higher the 
firm’s receivables turnover ratio, the shorter the time lag is between the sale and the cash collection.
Use the following to calculate the firm’s average-collection-period ratio:
Average@collection@period ratio = Days in accounting period
Receivables turnover ratio
=
365 days
7.31 times/year
= 50.0 days
Sam’s Appliance Shop’s accounts receivable are outstanding for an average of 50 days. Typically, 
the higher a firm’s average collection period ratio, the greater its chance of incurring bad debt 
losses. Sales don’t count unless a company collects the revenue from them.
One of the most useful applications of the collection period ratio is to compare it to the industry 
average and to the company’s credit terms. This comparison indicates the degree of control a small 
company exercises over its credit sales and collection techniques. A healthy collection period ratio
depends on the industry in which a company operates. For instance, the average collection period 
for companies that manufacture medical equipment is 56 days; for tire retailers, it is just 16 days.21
Perhaps the most meaningful analysis is comparing the collection period ratio to a company’s credit 
terms. One rule of thumb suggests that a company’s collection period ratio should be no more than 
one-third greater than its credit terms. For example, if a small company’s credit terms are net 30 
(payment due within 30 days), its average-collection-period ratio should be no more than 40 days 
(30 + 30 × 1/3). For this company, a ratio greater than 40 days indicates poor collection procedures.
Slow payers represent a great risk to many small businesses. Many entrepreneurs proudly
point to rapidly rising sales only to find that they must borrow money to keep their companies

TABLE 11.1 How Lowering Your Average Collection Period
Can Save You Money
Too often, entrepreneurs fail to recognize the importance of collecting their accounts receivable on 
time. After all, collecting accounts is not as glamorous or as much fun as generating sales. Lowering 
a company’s average collection period ratio, however, can produce tangible—and often significant—
savings. The following formula shows how to convert an improvement in a company’s average 
collection period ratio into dollar savings:
Annual savings
= (Credit sales * Annual interest rate * Number of days average collection period is lowered)
365
where
credit sales = company’s annual credit sales in dollars,
annual interest rate = the interest rate at which the company borrows money,
and number of days average collection period is lowered = the difference between the previous year’s
average collection period ratio and the current one.
Example
Sam’s Appliance Shop’s average collection period ratio is 50 days. Suppose that the previous year’s 
average-collection-period ratio was 58 days, an eight-day improvement. The company’s credit sales for 
the most recent year were $1,309,589. If Sam borrows money at 8.75%, this six-day improvement has
generated savings for Sam’s Appliance Shop of
Savings = $1,309,589 * 8.75% * 8 days
365 days
= $2,512
By collecting his accounts receivable just eight days faster on average, Sam has saved his business more 
than $2,512! Of course, if a company’s average-collection-period ratio rises, the same calculation will 
tell the owner how much that change costs.

going because their credit customers are paying their bills in 45, 60, or even 90 days instead of 
the desired 30. Slow receivables are a real danger because they usually lead to a cash crisis that 
threatens a company’s survival. Table 11.1 shows how to calculate the savings associated with
lowering a company’s average-collection-period ratio.
8. Average-Payable-Period Ratio. The converse of the average-collection-period ratio, the 
average-payable-period ratio (or days payables outstanding, DPO) tells the average number 
of days it takes a company to pay its accounts payable. Like the average collection period, it is
measured in days. To compute this ratio, an entrepreneur first calculates the payables turnover 
ratio. Sam’s payables turnover ratio is as follows:
Payables turnover ratio =
Purchases
Accounts payable
= $939,827
$152,580
= 6.16 times/year
To find the average payable period, use the following computation:
Average@payable@period ratio = Days in accounting period
Payables turnover ratio
=
365 days
6.16 times per year
= 59.3 days
Sam’s Appliance Shop takes an average of 59 days to pay its accounts with vendors and suppliers.

CHAPTER 11 • CREATING A SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL PLAN
441
One of the most meaningful comparisons for this ratio is against the credit terms suppli-
ers offer (or an average of the credit terms offered). If the average payable ratio slips beyond 
vendors’ credit terms, a company probably suffers from a sloppy accounts-payable procedure 
or from cash shortages, and its credit rating is in danger. An excessively high average-payables-
period ratio indicates the presence of a significant amount of past-due accounts payable. 
Although sound cash management calls for a business owner to keep his or her cash as long as
possible, slowing payables too drastically can severely damage the company’s credit rating. If 
this ratio is significantly lower than vendors’ credit terms, the company is not using its cash most 
effectively by paying vendors too quickly.
Comparing a company’s average-collection-period ratio (DSO) to its average-payable period
ratio (DPO) gives owners meaningful insight into their companies’ cash position. Ideally, the 
average payable period matches (or exceeds) the time it takes to convert inventory into sales and 
ultimately into cash. In this case, the company’s vendors are financing its inventory and its credit 
sales. Online retailer Amazon benefits from this situation. On average, the company does not pay 
its vendors until 127 days after it collects payments from its customers.22 Subtracting DSO from
DPO yields a company’s float, the net number of days of cash that flow into or out of a company. 
Sam’s Appliance Shop’s float is
Float = DPO − DSO = 59.3 days − 50.0 days = 9.3 days
A positive value for float means that cash will accumulate in a company over time, but a negative
number means that the company’s cash balance will diminish over time. Multiplying float by the 
company’s average daily sales tells Sam how much the company’s cash balance will change over 
the course of the year as a result of its collection and payable processes:
Change in cash position = $1,870,841 ÷ 365 days × 9.3 days = $47,668
We will see the impact that these three operating ratios—inventory turnover, accounts re-
ceivable, and accounts payable—have on a small company’s cash flow in the next chapter.
9. Net-Sales-to-Total-Assets Ratio. A small company’s net-sales-to-total-assets (also called the 
total-asset-turnover) ratio is a general measure of its ability to generate sales in relation to its 
assets. It describes how productively the firm employs its assets to produce sales revenue. The 
total-assets-turnover ratio is calculated as follows:
Total@assets@turnover ratio =
Net sales
Net total assets
= $1,870,841
$847,655
= 2.21:1
Sam’s Appliance Shop is generating $2.21 in sales for every dollar of assets.
The denominator of this ratio, net total assets, is the sum of all of a company’s assets (cash,
inventory, land, buildings, equipment, tools, and everything it owns) less depreciation. This ra-
tio is meaningful only when compared to that of similar firms in the same industry category. 
Monitoring it over time is very helpful for maintaining a sufficient asset base as a small business
grows. A total-assets-turnover ratio below the industry average indicates that a small company is 
not generating an adequate sales volume for its asset size.
A recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business reports “poor sales” 
as the one of the most commonly cited problems among small businesses, ranking just behind
perennial top problems “government regulation” and “taxes.”23 If a company’s sales fall below its 
break-even point, it operates at a loss, which is not sustainable.
PROFITABILITY RATIOS Profitability ratios indicate how efficiently a small company is being 
managed. They provide the owner with information about a company’s ability to use its resources
to generate a profit, its “bottom line.”
10. Net-Profit-on-Sales Ratio. The net-profit-on-sales ratio (also called the profit-margin-
on-sales ratio or the net-profit-margin ratio) measures a company’s profit per dollar of sales.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
This ratio (which is expressed as a percentage) shows the portion of each sales dollar remaining 
after deducting all expenses. The profit margin on sales is calculated as follows:
Net@profif t@on@sales ratio = Net profif t
Net sales
=
$60,629
$1,870,841
= 3.24%
For every dollar in sales Sam’s Appliance Shop generates, Sam keeps 3.24 cents in profit.
A recent study by Sageworks shows that the average net profit margin for privately held 
companies normally falls between 3 and 7 percent, but this ratio varies from one industry to 
another. The retail industry typically produces a net-profit-on-sales ratio that falls between 2 and
4 percent, but profit margins in the healthcare field range between 10 and 16 percent.25 If a com-
pany’s profit margin on sales is below the industry average, it may be a sign that its prices are too 
low, that its costs are excessively high, or both.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Villa Enterprises Villa Enterprises operates 360 restau-
rants, including the Villa Fresh Italian Kitchen chain, Office Beer Bar & Grill restaurants, and 
several other specialty restaurants serving salads and Asian and Mexican dishes. Andrew Steinberg, 
senior vice president of business operations, says Villa is able to reduce the impact of increasing 
food costs by buying in volume. Villa buys food products in half and full truckloads to gain econo-
mies of scale. Although it does tie up more cash in inventory, staying ahead of price increases has
helped maintain strong profits.26  ■
A natural reaction to low profitability ratios is to embark on a cost-cutting effort. Although
minimizing costs does improve profitability, entrepreneurs must be judicious in their cost cutting, 
taking a strategic approach rather than imposing across-the-board cuts. The key is to reduce costs 
without diminishing customer service and damaging employee morale. Cutting costs in areas 
that are vital to operating success—such as a retail jeweler eliminating its advertising expendi-
tures or a restaurant reducing the quality of its ingredients—usually hurts a company’s ability to 
compete and can lead to failure. For instance, choosing to lay off workers, a common reaction 
at many companies facing financial challenges, often backfires. Not only does a company risk 
losing talented workers and the knowledge they have built up over time, but research also shows 
that repeated rounds of layoffs destroy the morale and productivity of the remaining workers.27
If a company’s net-profit-on-sales ratio is excessively low, the owner first should check the 
gross profit margin (net sales minus cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net sales).
Of course, a reasonable gross profit margin varies from industry to industry. For instance, a 
service company may have a gross profit margin of 75 percent, while a manufacturer’s may 
be 35 percent. The key is to know what a reasonable gross profit margin is for your particular 
business. If this margin slips too low, the company’s future is in immediate jeopardy. An inad-
equate gross profit margin cannot cover all of a company’s business expenses and still be able
to generate a profit.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Chris Siversen: Maritime Parc Maritime Parc restau-
rant, in Jersey City, New Jersey, is feeling the effects of rising wholesale prices of beef and
shrimp. Chris Siversen, chef and co-owner, says that rather than increase prices, his restaurant has 
been forced to absorb rising food costs. In addition, the continued soft economy does not allow 
him to increase prices. As a result, profit margins have continued to decline.24 ■
Monitoring the net profit margin is especially important for fast-growing companies in
which sales are climbing rapidly. Unbridled growth can cause expenses to rise faster than sales, 
eroding a company’s net profit margin. Success can be deceptive: Sales are rising, but profits 
are shrinking. Ideally, a company reaches a point at which it achieves operating leverage, 
a situation in which increases in operating efficiency mean that expenses as a percentage of 
operating leverage
a situation in which increases 
in operating efficiency 
mean that expenses as a 
percentage of sales revenue 
flatten or even decline.

CHAPTER 11 • CREATING A SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL PLAN
443
sales revenues flatten or even decline. As a result, the company’s net profit margin climbs as 
it grows.
11. Net-Profit-to-Assets Ratio. The net-profit-to-assets (return-on-assets) ratio tells how much
profit a company generates for each dollar of assets it owns. This ratio describes how efficiently 
a business is putting to work all of the assets it owns to generate a profit. It tells how much net 
income an entrepreneur is squeezing from each dollar’s worth of the company’s assets. It is
calculated as follows:
Net@profif t@to@assets ratio =
Net profif t
Total assets
= $60,629
$847,655
= 7.15%
Sam’s Appliance shop earns a return of 7.15 percent on its asset base. This ratio provides clues
about the asset intensity of an industry. Return-on-assets ratios that are below 5 percent are in-
dicative of asset-intense industries that require heavy investments in assets to stay in business 
(e.g., manufacturing and railroads). Return-on-assets ratios that exceed 20 percent tend to occur in 
asset-light industries such as business or personal services—for example, advertising agencies and 
computer services. A net-profit-to-assets ratio that is below the industry average suggests that a
company is not using its assets efficiently to produce a profit. Another common application of this
ratio is to compare it to the company’s cost of borrowed capital. Ideally, a company’s return-on-
assets ratio should exceed the cost of borrowing money to purchase those assets. Companies that 
experience significant swings in the value of their assets over the course of a year often use an aver-
age value of the asset base over the accounting period to get a more realistic estimate of this ratio.
12. Net-Profit-to-Equity Ratio. The net-profit-to-equity ratio (or return on net worth ratio) 
measures the owners’ rate of return on investment (ROI). Because it reports the percentage of the 
owners’ investment in the business that is being returned through profits annually, it is one of the 
most important indicators of a firm’s profitability or a management’s efficiency. The net-profit-
to-equity ratio is computed as follows:
Net@profif t@to@equity ratio =
Net profif t
Owners’ equity (or net worth)
= $60,629
$267,655
= 22.65%
Sam is earning 22.65 percent on the money he has invested in this business.
This ratio compares profits earned during the accounting period with the amount the owner 
has invested in the business at the time. If this interest rate on the owners’ investment is exces-
sively low, some of this capital might be better employed elsewhere. A business should produce
a rate of return that exceeds its cost of capital.
Interpreting Business Ratios
Ratios are useful yardsticks when measuring a small firm’s performance and can point out po-
tential problems before they develop into serious crises. However, calculating these ratios is
not enough to ensure proper financial control. In addition to knowing how to calculate these 
ratios, entrepreneurs must understand how to interpret them and apply them to managing their 
businesses more effectively and efficiently. Many entrepreneurs use key financial ratios as a 
performance dashboard that help them manage by continuously assessing trends in the financial 
strength of their businesses.

year-end financial statements from their accountant. At their last
meeting with their accountant, Shelley Edison, three months ago, 
the Edens had mentioned that they seemed to be having trouble
paying their bills on time. “Some of our suppliers have threatened 
to put us on ‘credit hold,’” said Joe.

“I think you need to sit down with me very soon and let me
show you how to analyze your financial statements so you can
see what’s happening in your business,” Edison told them at that
meeting. Unfortunately, that was the beginning of Eden’s Garden’s 
busy season, and the Edens were so busy running the company 
that they never got around to setting a time to meet with Shelley.
“Now that business has slowed down a little, perhaps we 
should call Shelley and see what she can do to help us understand 
what our financial statements are trying to tell us,” said Kaitlin.
“Right. Before it’s too late to do anything about it,” said Joe, 
pulling out the financial statements presented here.

ments for Eden’s Garden, calculate the 12 ratios covered in
this chapter.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Peter Smith: Golden Spiral Creative
Peter Smith, president and COO of Golden Spiral Creative, a branding and
marketing agency based in Nashville, Tennessee, uses a spreadsheet he developed 
to create a company dashboard. The first key metric is overhead. “This has every 
employee’s salary listed, along with employer taxes (FICA & FUTA), rent, and any
other monthly expense,” says Smith. “I use this to determine our monthly over-
head. It also allows me to quickly project how a new hire or subscription would 
alter my overhead.” Smith also has a section on the same spreadsheet that includes
all monthly retainers the company is paying out to its independent contractors. “I 
also have a section for cost accounting to determine my break-even rate per bill-
able hour,” says Smith. “We bill on an hourly basis so this is really helpful.” Finally,
his dashboard acts as a calculator he can use to help bid on new projects. “I enter 
the total number of hours that we expect to work and what we are charging for 
that project,” explains Smith. “From there I enter any contractor expenses I will
have to pay. The formula takes our break-even per billable hour number and the 
project hours to determine what that project ‘costs’ us in terms of human capital. All of this 
together calculates out net income and profit margin on a per project basis. I can toggle the num-
bers a bit to see how and changes affect our profit margin.”28 ■
Not every business measures its success with the same ratios. In fact, key performance ra-
tios vary dramatically across industries and even within different segments of the same indus-
try. Entrepreneurs must know and understand which ratios are most crucial to their companies’ 
success and focus on monitoring and controlling those indicators. Sometimes business owners
develop ratios and measures that are unique to their own operations to help them achieve success.
Known as critical numbers (or key performance indicators, KPIs), these indicators measure
key financial and operational aspects of a company’s performance. When these critical numbers 
are headed in the right direction, a business is on track to achieve its objectives. Norm Brodsky,
owner of a successful document storage and delivery business in New York City, breaks his
business into four categories and tracks critical numbers for each one. Every Monday morning, 
he receives a report comparing the previous week’s critical numbers to those of the previous 
28 weeks and the same week for the previous three years. With these figures he can quickly as-
sess how the business is performing. If there are problems with any KPI, he can seek out more 
information to identify any problems or concerns.29 Examples of critical numbers at other com-
panies include the following:
● A bank’s “happy-to-grumpy” ratio, which measures the level of employee satisfaction. 
Studies show that employees at the bank who score high on this index are more productive
and receive higher customer satisfaction ratings.30
● Sales per labor hour at a supermarket.
● The number of referrals for a healthcare facility. Managers use this number to predict the 
number of new patients they can expect and to identify swings in patient revenue. This in-
formation helps with staffing decisions and managing cash flow.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
● Food costs as a percentage of sales for a restaurant. When rapidly rising flour and cheese 
prices pushed food costs as a percentage of sales from the normal 34 percent to 40 percent 
at Mark Parry’s pizza restaurant, he was forced to raise prices. Parry knows his restaurant 
will not make a profit when food costs get above 40 percent.31 At Dos Caminos, a Mexican
restaurant in New York City, chef Ivy Stark’s goal is to keep the restaurant’s food cost at or 
below 26 percent of sales. Stark relies on a five-page spreadsheet generated each morning 
to keep food costs under control.32
● The utilization ratio, billable hours as a percentage of total hours worked at an Internet 
service provider.
● Site traffic and sales dollars per transaction, two critical numbers for an ecommerce 
business to monitor on a daily basis.
● The load factor, the percentage of seats filled with passengers at an airline.33
Critical numbers may be different for two companies that compete in the same industry. The
key is identifying your company’s critical numbers, monitoring them, and then driving them 
r
in the right direction. That requires communicating the importance of these critical numbers to 
employees and giving them feedback on how well the business is achieving them. For instance,
one California retail chain established the daily customer count and the average sale per customer 
as its critical numbers. The company organized a monthly contest with prizes and posted charts 
tracking each store’s performance. Soon, employees were working hard to improve their stores’
performances over the previous year and to outdo other stores in the chain. The healthy rivalry 
among stores boosted the company’s performance significantly.34
Another valuable way to use ratios is to compare them with those of similar businesses in
the same industry. By comparing their companies’ financial statistics to industry averages, en-
trepreneurs are able to locate problem areas and maintain adequate financial controls. Known 
as financial benchmarking, comparing a company’s key financial indicators to averages from 
many firms of similar size in the same industry, can help identify problem areas that the com-
pany’s own history may not show. Benchmarking also is an effective way to set KPIs to ensure 
your business is at least doing as well as others in your industry, if not exceeding their performance.
The principle behind calculating these ratios and comparing them to industry norms is the 
same as that of most medical tests in the healthcare profession. Just as a healthy person’s blood
pressure and cholesterol levels should fall within a range of normal values, so should a finan-
cially healthy company’s ratios. A company cannot deviate too far from these normal values and 
remain successful for long. When deviations from “normal” do occur (and they will), a business 
owner should focus on determining the cause of the deviations. In some cases, deviations are the 
result of sound business decisions, such as taking on inventory in preparation for the busy season,
investing heavily in new technology, and others. In other instances, however, ratios that are out 
of the normal range for a particular type of business are indicators of what could become serious 
problems for a company. When comparing a company’s critical numbers to industry standards, 
entrepreneurs should ask the following questions:
● Is there a significant difference in my company’s ratio and the industry average?
● If so, is the difference meaningful?
● Is the difference good or bad?
● What are the possible causes of this difference? What is the most likely cause?
● Does this cause require that I take action?
● If so, what action should I take to correct the problem?
When used properly, critical numbers can help owners to identify potential problem areas 
in their businesses early on—before they become crises that threaten their very survival. Several 
organizations regularly compile and publish operating statistics, including key ratios, that sum-
marize the financial performance of many businesses across a wide range of industries. The local 
library should subscribe to most of these publications:
Risk Management Association. Founded in 1914, the RMA publishes its Annual 
Statement Studies, showing ratios and other financial data for more than 760 different 
financial 
benchmarking
a process in which 
entrepreneurs compare a 
company’s key financial 
indicators to averages from 
many companies of similar 
size in the same industry to 
identify problem areas that 
the company’s own history 
may not show.

industrial, wholesale, retail, and service categories that are organized by NAICS and 
SIC code.
Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. Since 1932, Dun & Bradstreet has published Industry Norms and 
Key Business Ratios, which covers more than 800 business categories. Dun & Bradstreet 
also publishes Cost of Doing Business, a series of operating ratios compiled from the 
Statistics of Income reports of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Bizminer. This industry financial data can be segmented by both company size and 
geographic location.
Almanac of Business and Financial Ratios. Published by CCH, this almanac reports 
comparative financial data and ratios for nearly 200 industries by company size.
Standard & Poor’s Industry Surveys. In addition to providing information on financial 
ratios and comparative financial analysis, these surveys also contain useful details on in-
dustry operations, current industry trends, and key terms in the industry.
Industry Spotlight. Published by Schonfeld & Associates, this publication, which can be 
customized for any one of 250 industries, contains financial statement data and key ratios 
gleaned from IRS tax returns. Industry Spotlight also provides detailed financial informa

publishes IRS Corporate Financial Ratios, a comprehensive reference book that features 
76 financial ratios for more than 250 industries using NAICS codes.
Online resources. Many companies publish comparative financial resources online. Some
require subscriptions, but others are free:
● Bizstats publishes common-size financial statements and ratios for 95 business catego-
ries for sole proprietorships, S corporations, and corporations.
● Reuters provides an overview of many industries that includes industry trends and news 
as well as financial ratios.
● A subscription to Lexis/Nexis allows users to view detailed company profiles, including 
financial reports and analysis, for publicly held companies.
Industry associations. Virtually every type of business is represented by a national trade 
association that publishes detailed financial data compiled from its membership. For 
example, owners of small supermarkets could contact the National Association of Retail 
Grocers or check the Progressive Grocer, its trade publication, for financial statistics rel-
evant to their operations.
Government agencies. Several government agencies, including the IRS, the Federal 
Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce, the Census Bureau, the Department of 
Agriculture, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically publish reports 
that provide financial operating data on a variety of industries, although the categories are 
more general. For instance, the IRS publishes Statistics of Income, which includes income 
statement and balance sheet statistics that are compiled from income tax returns and are 
arranged by industry, asset size, and annual sales. Every five years (years ending in 2 and 
7), the Census Bureau publishes the Economic Census (www.census.gov/econ/census), 
which provides general industry statistics and ratios.
What Do All of These Numbers Mean?
Learning to interpret financial ratios just takes a little practice! This section and Table 11.2 show 
you how it’s done by comparing the ratios from the operating data already computed for Sam’s to 
those taken from the RMA’s Annual Statement Studies. (The industry median is the ratio falling 
exactly in the middle when sample elements are arranged in ascending or descending order.) Cal-
culating the variance from the industry median—(company ratio – industry median) ÷ industry 
median—helps entrepreneurs identify the areas in which the company is out of line with the typi-
cal company in the industry.
When comparing ratios for their individual businesses to published statistics, entrepreneurs
must remember that the comparison is made against averages. An entrepreneur should strive to 
achieve ratios that are at least as good as these average figures. The goal should be to manage

TABLE 11.2 Ratio Analysis: Sam’s Appliance Shop versus the Industry Median
Sam’s Appliance Shop
Industry Median
Variance (%)
Liquidity Ratios—Tell whether a small business will be able to meet its maturing
obligations as they come due.
1. Current Ratio = 1.87:1
1.60:1
16.7%
Sam’s Appliance Shop falls short of the rule of thumb of 2:1, but its current ratio 
is above the industry median by a significant amount. Sam’s should have no problem
meeting its short-term debts as they come due. By this measure, the company’s 
liquidity is solid.
2. Quick Ratio = 0.63:1
0.50:1
25.9%
Again, Sam’s is below the rule of thumb of 1:1, but the company passes this
test of liquidity when measured against industry standards. Sam’s relies on selling 
inventory to satisfy short-term debt (as do most appliance shops). If sales slump, the
result could be liquidity problems for Sam’s.
Leverage Ratios—Measure the financing supplied by the company’s owners
against that supplied by its creditors as a gauge of the depth of a
company’s debt.
3. Debt Ratio = 0.68:1
0.62:1
10.4%
Creditors provide 68 percent of Sam’s total assets, which is above the industry 
median of 62 percent. Although Sam’s does not appear to be overburdened with debt, 
the company might have difficulty borrowing additional money, especially from 
conservative lenders.
4. Debt-to-Net-Worth Ratio = 2.20:1
2.30:1
−4.5%
Sam’s Appliance Shop owes $2.20 to creditors for every $1 the owners have 
invested in the business (compared to $2.30 in debt to every $1 in equity for the
typical business). Although this is not an exorbitant amount of debt by industry 
standards, many lenders and creditors see Sam’s as “borrowed up.” Borrowing 
capacity is somewhat limited because creditors’ claims against the business are 
more than twice those of the owners.
5. Times-Interest-Earned Ratio = 2.52:1
2.10:1
20.1%
Sam’s earnings are high enough to cover the interest payments on its debt by a 
factor of 2.52, better than the typical firm in the industry, whose earnings cover 
its interest payments just 2.1 times. Sam’s Appliance Shop has a comfortable 
cushion when meeting its interest payments, although some lenders want to see 
times-interest-earned ratios of at least 3:1.
Operating Ratios—Evaluate a company’s overall performance and show how 
effectively it is putting its resources to work.
6. Average-Inventory-Turnover Ratio = 2.05 times/year
4.4 times/year
−53.5%
Inventory is moving through Sam’s at a very slow pace, half that of the industry
f
median. The company has a problem with slow-moving items in its inventory and, 
perhaps, too much inventory. Which items are they, and why are they slow moving?
Does Sam need to drop some product lines?
7. Average-Collection-Period Ratio = 50.0 days
10.5 days
376.3%
Sam’s Appliance Shop collects the average accounts receivable after 50 days,
compared with the industry median of about 11 days, nearly five times longer. A more 
meaningful comparison is against Sam’s credit terms; if credit terms are net 30 (or 
anywhere close to that), Sam’s has a dangerous collection problem, one that drains
cash and profits and demands immediate attention!
8. Average-Payable-Period Ratio = 59.3 days
23.0 days
158.1%
Sam’s payables are significantly slower than those of the typical firm in the 
industry. Stretching payables too far could seriously damage the company’s credit 
rating, causing suppliers to cut off future trade credit. This could be a sign of cash 
flow problems or a sloppy accounts-payable procedure. This problem, which indicates 
that the company suffers from cash flow problems, also demands immediate attention.

9. Net-Sales-to-Total-Assets Ratio = 2.21:1
3.4:1
−35.1%
Sam’s Appliance Shop is not generating enough sales, given the size of its 
asset base. This could be the result of a number of factors—improper inventory, 
inappropriate pricing, poor location, poorly trained sales personnel, and many others. 
The key is to find the cause— fast!
Profitability Ratios—Measure how efficiently a firm is operating and offer 
information about its bottom line.
10. Net-Profit-on-Sales Ratio = 3.24%
4.3%
−24.6%
After deducting all expenses, 3.24 cents of each sales dollar remains as profit for 
Sam’s—nearly 25 percent below the industry median. Sam should review his company’s
gross profit margin and investigate its operating expenses, checking them against 
industry standards and looking for those that are out of balance.
11. Net-Profit-to-Assets Ratio = 7.15%
4.0%
78.8%
Sam’s generates a return of 7.15% for every $1 in assets, which is nearly
79 percent above the industry median. Given his asset base, Sam is squeezing an 
above-average return from his company. This could be an indication that Sam’s business 
is highly profitable; however, given the previous ratio, this is unlikely. It is more likely
that Sam’s asset base is thinner than the industry average.
12. Net-Profit-to-Equity Ratio = 22.65%
16.0%
41.6%
Sam’s Appliance Shop’s owners are earning 22.65 percent on the money they
have invested in the business. This yield is well above the industry median and, given 
the previous ratio, is more a result of the owner’s relatively low investment in the
business than an indication of its superior profitability. Sam is using O.P.M. (other 
people’s money) to generate a profit.
the business so that its financial performance is above average. As they compare their company’s 
financial performance to those covered in the published statistics, they inevitably will discern 
differences between them. They should note those items that are substantially out of line from 
the industry average. However, a ratio that varies from the average does not necessarily mean that 
the small business is in financial jeopardy. Instead of making drastic changes in financial policy, 
entrepreneurs must explore why the figures are out of line.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Greg Smith: Petra Group Greg Smith, CEO of Petra 
Group, a systems integrator with $1.5 million in annual sales, once gave little thought to 
comparing his company’s financial performance against industry standards. Then Petra Group’s 
sales flattened, and Smith’s company faced the prospect of losing money for the first time. Smith
worked with an accounting firm, using information from the RMA Annual Statement Studies and 
a nonprofit organization that provides similar studies, to analyze his company’s financial position. 
Comparing his numbers to industry statistics, Smith quickly saw that payroll expenses for his 
15-person company were too high to allow the company to generate a profit. He also discovered 
that Petra Group’s debt ratio was too high. To restore his company’s financial strength, Smith re-
duced his staff by two and began relying more on temporary employees and independent con-
tractors. He realigned Petra Group’s financing, reducing the company’s line of credit from $100,000 
to just $35,000. The analysis also revealed several strengths for the company. For instance, the 
company’s average collection period was 36.5 days compared to an industry average of 73 days! 
Smith continues to use ratio comparisons to make key decisions for his company, and he credits 
the initial financial analysis with getting his company back on the track to profitability.35 ■
In addition to comparing ratios to industry averages, owners should analyze their firms’ 
financial ratios over time. By themselves, these ratios are “snapshots” of a company’s financial
position at a single instant; however, by examining these trends over time, an entrepreneur can 
detect gradual shifts that otherwise might go unnoticed until a financial crisis is looming (see 
Figure 11.5).

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Break-Even Analysis
Another key component of every sound financial plan is a break-even (or cost-volume-profit)
analysis. A small company’s break-even point is the level of operation (typically expressed as 
sales dollars or production quantity) at which it neither earns a profit nor incurs a loss. At this 
level of activity, sales revenue equals expenses—that is, the firm “breaks even.” A business that

generates sales that are greater than its break-even point will produce a profit, but one that oper-
ates below its break-even point will incur a net loss. Many entrepreneurs leave their own salary 
out of a break-even calculation. This is not a wise approach. Although the entrepreneur may 
t
forgo paychecks during start-up, the business does not truly break even until the entrepreneur is 
able to earn a market salary from the business. By analyzing costs and expenses, an entrepreneur 
can calculate the minimum level of activity required to keep a company in operation. These 
techniques can then be refined to project the sales needed to generate the desired profit. Most 
potential lenders and investors expect entrepreneurs to prepare a break-even analysis to assist 
them in evaluating the earning potential of the new business. In addition to its being a simple, 
useful screening device for financial institutions, break-even analysis can also serve as a plan-
ning device for entrepreneurs. It can show an entrepreneur just how unprofitable a poorly planned
business venture is likely to be.
Calculating the Break-Even Point
An entrepreneur can calculate a company’s break-even point by using a simple mathematical 
formula. To begin the analysis, the entrepreneur must determine fixed costs and variable costs. 
Fixed expenses are those that do not vary with changes in the volume of sales or production (e.g., 
rent, depreciation expense, insurance, lease or loan payments, and others). Variable expenses, on 
the other hand, vary directly with changes in the volume of sales or production (e.g., raw material 
costs, sales commissions, hourly wages, and others).
Some expenses cannot be neatly categorized as fixed or variable because they contain ele-
ments of both. These semivariable expenses change, although not proportionately, with changes 
in the level of sales or production (electricity is one example). These costs remain constant up to 
fixed expenses
expenses that do not vary 
with changes in the volume 
of sales or production.
variable expenses
expenses that vary directly 
with changes in the volume 
of sales or production.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
a particular production or sales volume and then climb as that volume is exceeded. To calculate 
the break-even point, an entrepreneur must separate these expenses into their fixed and variable 
components. A number of techniques are available (which are beyond the scope of this text), but 
a good cost accounting system can provide the desired results.
Here are the steps an entrepreneur must take to compute the break-even point using an 
example of a typical small business, the Magic Shop:
Step 1. Forecast the expenses the business can expect to incur. With the help of 
a forecast for a new venture or a budget for an operating small business, an 
entrepreneur can develop estimates of sales revenue, cost of goods sold, and ex-
penses for the upcoming accounting period. The Magic Shop expects net sales of 
$950,000 in the upcoming year, with a cost of goods sold of $646,000 and total 
expenses of $236,500.
Step 2. Categorize the expenses estimated in step 1 into fixed expenses and variable 
expenses. Separate semivariable expenses into their component parts. From the 
budget, the owner anticipates variable expenses (including the cost of goods sold) 
of $705,125 and fixed expenses of $177,375.
Step 3. Calculate the ratio of variable expenses to net sales. For the Magic Shop, this
percentage is $705,125 ÷ $950,000 = 74 percent. The Magic Shop uses 74 cents 
out of every sales dollar to cover variable expenses, which leaves 26 cents
($1.00 − 0.74) of each sales dollar as a contribution margin to cover fixed costs 
and make a profit.
Step 4. Compute the break-even point by inserting this information into the following 
formula: 
Break@even sales ($) =
Total fif xed cost
Contribution margin expressed as a percentage of sales
For the Magic Shop,
Break@even sales = $177,375
0.26
= $682,212
Thus, the Magic Shop will break even with sales of $682,212. At this point, sales revenue
generated will just cover total fixed and variable expense. The Magic Shop will earn no profit and 
will incur no loss. We can verify this with the following calculations:
Sales at break-even point
$ 682,212
−Variable expenses (74% of sales)
−504,837
Contribution margin
177,375
−Fixed expenses
−177,375
Net profit (or net loss)
$            0
Some entrepreneurs find it more meaningful to break down their companies’ annual break-
even point into a daily sales figure. If the Magic Shop will be open 312 days per year, the average 
daily sales it must generate just to break even is $682,212 ÷ 312 days = $2,187 per day.
Adding a Profit
What if the Magic Shop’s owner wants to do better than just break even? This should be the 
r
goal of all entrepreneurs. Just as a track coach tell runners to run through the finish line and 
football coaches want their players to run over the goal line into the endzone, an entrepreneur 
should never be satisfied with simply reaching break even. The goal is to move through break-
even into profitability. Break-even analysis can be adjusted to consider this goal. Suppose the

CHAPTER 11 • CREATING A SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL PLAN
453
owner expects a reasonable profit (before taxes) of $80,000. What level of sales must the Magic 
Shop achieve to generate this? The entrepreneur can calculate this by treating the desired profit 
as if it were a fixed cost, modifying the break-even formula to include the desired net income:
Sales ($) =
Total fif xed expenses + Desired net income
Contribution margin expressed as a percentage of sales
= $177,375 + $80 000
0.26
= $989,904
To achieve a net profit of $80,000 (before taxes), the Magic Shop must generate net sales of 
$989,904. Once again, if we convert this annual sales volume into a daily sales volume, we get 
$989,904 ÷ 312 days = $3,173 per day.
Break-Even Point in Units
Some small businesses prefer to express the break-even point in units produced or sold instead 
of in dollars. Manufacturers often find this approach particularly useful. The following formula
computes the break-even point in units:
Break@even volume =
Total fif xed costs
Sales price per unit - Variable cost per unit
For example, suppose that Trilex Manufacturing Company estimates its fixed costs for 
producing its line of small appliances at $390,000. The variable costs (including materials, direct 
labor, and factory overhead) amount to $12.10 per unit, and the selling price per unit is $17.50.
Trilex computes its contribution margin this way:
Contribution margin = Price per unit - Variable cost per unit
= $17.50 per unit - $12.10 per unit
= $5.40 per unit
So, Trilex’s break-even volume is as follows:
Break@even volume (units) =
Total fif xed costs
Per unit contribution margin
=
$390,000
$5.40 per unit
= 72,222 units
To convert this number of units to break-even sales dollars, Trilex simply multiplies it by the 
selling price per unit:
Break-even sales = 72,222 units × $17.50 per unit = $1,263,889
Trilex could compute the sales required to produce a desired profit by treating the profit as
if it were a fixed cost:
Sales (units) = Total fif xed costs + Desired net income
Per unit contribution margin
For example, if Trilex wanted to earn a $60,000 profit, its required sales would be
Sales (units) = 390,000 + 60,000 = 83,333 units
5.40
which would require 83,333 units × $17.50 per unit = $1,458,328 in sales.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Constructing a Break-Even Chart
The following steps outline the procedure for constructing a graph that visually portrays a com-
pany’s break-even point (that point where revenues equal expenses):
Step 1. On the horizontal axis, mark a scale measuring sales volume in dollars (or 
in units sold or some other measure of volume). The break-even chart for the 
Magic Shop shown in Figure 11.6 uses sales volume in dollars because it applies 
to all types of businesses, departments, and products.
Step 2. On the vertical axis, mark a scale measuring income and expenses in dollars. 
Step 3. Draw a fixed expense line intersecting the vertical axis at the proper dollar level 
parallel to the horizontal axis. The area between this line and the horizontal axis 
represents the company’s fixed expenses. On the break-even chart for the Magic 
Shop shown in Figure 11.6, the fixed expense line is drawn horizontally beginning 
at $177,375 (point A). Because this line is parallel to the horizontal axis, it indi-
cates that fixed expenses remain constant at all levels of activity.
Step 4. Draw a total expense line that slopes upward beginning at the point where 
the fixed cost line intersects the vertical axis. The precise location of the total 
expense line is determined by plotting the total cost incurred at a particular sales 
volume. The total cost for a given sales level is found by using the following 
formula:
Total expenses = Fixed expenses + Variable expenses expressed as a % of sales × Sales level
Arbitrarily choosing a sales level of $950,000, the Magic Shop’s total costs would 
be as follows:
Total expenses = $177,375 + (0.74 * $950,000)
= $880,375
Thus, the Magic Shop’s total cost is $880,375 at a net sales level of $950,000 
(point B). The variable cost line is drawn by connecting points A and B. The area 
between the total cost line and the horizontal axis measures the total costs the 
Magic Shop incurs at various levels of sales. For example, if the Magic Shop’s
sales are $850,000, its total costs will be $806,375.
Step 5. Beginning at the graph’s origin, draw a 45-degree revenue line showing where 
total sales volume equals total income. For the Magic Shop, point C shows that 
sales = income = $950,000.

Step 6. Locate the break-even point by finding the intersection of the total expense 
line and the revenue line. If the Magic Shop operates at a sales volume to the left 
of the break-even point, it will incur a loss because the expense line is higher than the 
revenue line over this range. This is shown by the triangular section labeled “Loss 
Area.” On the other hand, if the firm operates at a sales volume to the right of the
break-even point, it will earn a profit because the revenue line lies above the expense 
line over this range. This is shown by the triangular section labeled “Profit Area.”
Using Break-Even Analysis
Break-even analysis is a useful planning tool for the potential small business owner, especially 
when approaching potential lenders and investors for funds. It provides an opportunity for inte-
grated analysis of sales volume, expenses, income, and other relevant factors. Break-even analysis
is a simple, preliminary screening device for an entrepreneur faced with the business start-up deci-
sion. It is easy to understand and use. With just a few calculations, an entrepreneur can determine
the effects of various financial strategies on the business operation. It is a helpful tool for evaluating 
the impact of changes in investments and expenditures. Greg Smith, for instance, knows that Petra 
Group’s break-even point is $23,000 per week, and he compares sales to that figure every week.36
Calculating the break-even point for a start-up business is important because it tells an entre-
preneur the minimum volume of sales required to stay in business in the long run.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Albert Poland: Blue Man
Albert Poland, a Broadway producer and general
manager of the Astor Place Theater, an off-Broadway theater in
New York City that has been the home of the famous Blue Man 
Group for many years, knows that the show must generate 
ticket sales of $40,000 per week to break even. In addition to 
performers’ salaries, the show’s costs include weekly rent, a ser-
vice package fee that covers the salaries of the house and box
office staff, and a percentage of the gross weekly box office 
receipts. The show’s break-even point represents sales of about 
450 seats per week. The theater’s capacity is 300 seats per per-
formance, which means that the show reaches its break-even 
point by selling out 1.5 of its 9 performances each week. Most
of the Blue Man Group performances at the Astor Place Theater 
are sold out, making it a highly profitable business.37 ■
Anita Dawson is doing some financial planning for her small gift 
store. According to her budget for the upcoming year, Anita is 
expecting sales of $495,000. She estimates the cost of goods sold 
will be $337,000 and other variable expenses will total $42,750. 
Using the previous year as a guide, Anita anticipates fixed expenses 
of $78,100.
Anita recalls a meeting she had recently with her accountant, 
who mentioned that her store already had passed its break-even
point eight and a half months into the year. She was pleased but
really didn’t know how the accountant had come up with that 
calculation. Now Anita is considering expanding her store into 
a vacant building next door to her existing location and taking
on three new product lines. The company’s cost structure would
change, adding another $66,000 to fixed costs and $22,400 to 
variable expenses. Anita believes the expansion could generate 
additional sales of $102,000 in the first year.
She wonders what she should do.
1. Calculate Anita’s break-even point without the expansion 
plans. Draw a break-even chart.
2. Compute the break-even point assuming that Anita decides 
to expand her business.
3. Do you recommend that Anita expand her business? Explain.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Break-even analysis does have certain limitations. It is too simple to use as a final screening
device because it ignores the importance of cash flows. In addition, the accuracy of the analysis 
depends on the accuracy of the revenue and expense estimates. Finally, the assumptions pertain-
ing to break-even analysis may not be realistic for some businesses. Break-even calculations
assume the following: fixed expenses remain constant for all levels of sales volume, variable 
expenses change in direct proportion to changes in sales volume, and changes in sales volume
have no effect on unit sales price. Relaxing these assumptions does not render this tool useless, 
however. For example, the owner could employ nonlinear break-even analysis to determine a 
company’s break-even point.
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Describe how to prepare the basic financial 
statements and use them to manage a small 
business.
●Entrepreneurs rely on three basic financial state-
ments to understand the financial conditions of their 
companies:
1. The balance sheet—Built on the accounting
t
equation: Assets = Liabilities = Owner’s equity,
it provides an estimate of the company’s value on 
a particular date.
2. The income statement—This statement 
t
compares the firm’s revenues to its expenses to
determine its net income (or loss). It provides 
information about the company’s bottom line.
3. The statement of cash flows—This statement 
shows the change in the company’s working 
capital over the accounting period by listing the 
sources and the uses of funds.
2. Create projected (pro forma) financial statements.
●Projected financial statements are a basic component 
of a sound financial plan. They help the manager 
plot the company’s financial future by setting operat-
ing objectives and by analyzing the reasons for vari-
ations from targeted results. In addition, the small 
business in search of start-up funds will need these
pro forma statements to present to prospective lend-
ers and investors. They also assist in determining the
amount of cash, inventory, fixtures, and other assets 
the business will need to begin operation.
3. Understand the basic financial statements 
through ratio analysis.
●The 12 key ratios described in this chapter are 
divided into four major categories: liquidity ratios,
which show the small firm’s ability to meet its 
current obligations; leverage ratios, which tell how
much of the company’s financing is provided by 
owners and how much by creditors; operating 
ratios, which show how effectively the firm uses its 
resources; and profitability ratios, which disclose 
the company’s profitability.
●Many agencies and organizations regularly publish 
such statistics. If there is a discrepancy between the 
small firm’s ratios and those of the typical business, 
the owner should investigate the reason for the dif-f
ference. A below-average ratio does not necessarily 
mean that the business is in trouble.
4. Explain how to interpret financial ratios.
●To benefit from ratio analysis, the small company 
should compare its ratios to those of other compa-
nies in the same line of business and look for trends 
over time.
●When business owners detect deviations in their 
companies’ ratios from industry standards, they 
should determine the cause of the deviations. In 
some cases, such deviations are the result of sound 
business decisions; in other instances, however,
ratios that are out of the normal range for a particu-
lar type of business are indicators of what could 
become serious problems for a company.
5. Conduct a break-even analysis for a small 
company.
●Business owners should know their firm’s break-
even point, the level of operations at which total 
revenues equal total costs; it is the point at which
companies neither earn a profit nor incur a loss. 
Although just a simple screening device, break-
even analysis is a useful planning and decision-
making tool.

CHAPTER 12 • MANAGING CASH FLOW
459
Cash—a four-letter word that has become a curse for many small businesses. Lack of this valu-
able asset has driven countless small companies into bankruptcy. More small businesses fail 
for a lack of cash than for a lack of profit. Unfortunately, many more firms will become failure 
statistics because their owners have neglected the principles of cash management that can spell 
the difference between success and failure. “Everything is about cash,” says entrepreneur-turned-
venture-capitalist Guy Kawasaki, “raising it, conserving it, collecting it.”1 Indeed, developing a 
cash forecast is essential for new businesses because start-up companies usually do not generate 
positive cash flow right away. A common cause of business failures, especially in start-up and 
fast-growth companies, is overemphasis on increasing sales with little concern for collecting
the receivables those sales generate. “Your sales figures may be great, but it’s cash flow that 
determines whether you can keep the doors open,” says one business writer.2 Another problem 
is that entrepreneurs neglect to forecast how much cash their companies will need to get through 
the valley of death, the time period during which start-up companies experience negative cash 
flow as they ramp up operations, build their customer bases, and become self-supporting (see 
Figure 12.1). The result is always the same: a cash crisis.
As you learned in the previous chapter, controlling the financial aspects of a business us-
ing the analysis of basic financial statements with ratios is immensely important; however, by 
themselves, these techniques are insufficient for achieving business success. Entrepreneurs are 
prone to focus on their companies’ income statements—particularly sales and profits. The in-
come statement, of course, shows only part of a company’s financial picture. It is entirely pos-
sible for a business to earn a profit and still go out of business by running out of cash. In other 
words, managing a company’s total financial performance effectively requires an entrepreneur to
look beyond the “bottom line” and focus on what it takes to keep a company going—cash. “If a 
company isn’t producing cash from its ongoing business, all the rest is smoke and mirrors,” says
Michael Connellan, a successful entrepreneur and former investment banker.3
Cash Management
A survey by American Express OPEN Small Business Monitor reports that 52 percent of small 
business owners say they experience problems managing cash flow.4 Managing cash flow is a
universal problem for entrepreneurs; a recent survey of Britain’s small and medium-sized busi-
nesses reports that 46 percent of owners say they had suffered at least one disruption to their com-
panies’ cash flow, most often caused by customers paying their bills late or not at all.5 Although 
cash flow is a common concern for almost every business owner, the sluggish recovery from the 
Great Recession has put excess strain on many companies’ cash flow. Since 2010, the percent-
age of small business owners who report that their companies’ cash flow is either somewhat or

very poor has declined, while the percentage of owners who say their companies’ cash flow is 
either somewhat or very good has increased. However, small business’s cash positions have not 
returned to pre-recession levels (see Figure 12.2). The best way to avoid a potentially business-
crushing cash crisis is to use the principles of sound cash management. Cash management in-
volves forecasting, collecting, disbursing, investing, and planning for the cash a company needs 
to operate smoothly. Cash management is a vital task because cash is the most important yet least 
productive asset a small business owns. A business must have enough cash to meet its obliga-
tions, or it will be declared bankrupt. Creditors, employees, and lenders expect to be paid on
time, and cash is the required medium of exchange. However, some companies retain excessive
amounts of cash to meet any unexpected circumstances that might arise. These dormant dollars 
have an income-earning potential that owners are ignoring; investing this cash, even for a short 
time, can add to a company’s earnings. Proper cash management permits owners to adequately 
meet the cash demands of their businesses, avoid retaining unnecessarily large cash balances, and
stretch the profit-generating power of each dollar their companies own.
Although cash flow difficulties afflict companies of all sizes and ages, young companies, 
especially, are cash sponges, soaking up every available dollar and always hungry for more. The 
reason usually is that their cash-generating “engines” are not operating at full speed yet and can-
not provide enough power to generate the cash necessary to cover rapidly climbing operating 
expenses. Entrepreneurs must manage cash flow from the day they launch their businesses.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: H.J. Heinz: H.J. Heinz Company Shortly after H.J. Heinz, 
who started in the food business at age 14 when he began selling horseradish he grew in
his garden, and two partners launched their first food business (which sold bottled horseradish) in 
1875, their company’s rapidly growing sales outstripped their start-up capital, and the company 
ran out of cash. A local newspaper called the entrepreneurs a “trio in a pickle.” After the company 
failed, Heinz personally was liable for $20,000, a huge sum in that day. Through much determina-
tion, he paid off the entire debt. Undaunted, Heinz learned from his mistakes and launched a
second food company the very next year. In this venture, he added the product that would even-
tually make him famous—ketchup—and with the help of careful cash management, the H.J. Heinz 
Company grew into one of the largest food companies in the world.6 ■
Managing cash flow is also an acute problem for rapidly growing businesses. In fact, fast-
track companies are most likely to suffer cash shortages. Many successful, growing, and profit-
able businesses fail because they become insolvent; they do not have adequate cash to meet the
needs of a growing business with a booming sales volume. As a company’s sales increase, its 
owner also must hire more employees, expand plant capacity, increase the sales force, build in-
ventory, and incur other drains on the firm’s cash supply. During rapid growth, cash collections 
typically fall behind, compounding the problem. Cash flows out of these high-growth companies

much faster than it comes in. The head of the National Federation of Independent Business says 
many small business owners “wake up one day to find that the price of success is no cash on hand. 
They don’t understand that if they’re successful, inventory and receivables will increase faster 
than profits can fund them.”7 Table 12.1 shows signs that a company is facing an impending cash 
flow crisis.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Susan Spencer Frustrated by the rigid styles and uncom-
fortable fit of tennis dresses in the late 1960s, Susan Spencer designed a tennis dress that 
was more comfortable and flattering to the female figure. When many of her friends asked her 
to make dresses for them, Spencer, then in her twenties, decided to start a business designing and
selling them. She found a clothing manufacturer and took on a partner whose main focus was 
growing sales as fast as possible. Spencer learned a valuable and costly lesson about fast growth,
payment terms, and cash flow; her business failed when it ran out of cash. “One of the most im-
portant things is to know the payment terms your customers are setting, what they’re going to 
pay you and when,” says Spencer, who went on to become the first female general manager of a 
National Football League team. “I was in business 4 years, before I figured this out. I didn’t know 
that department stores paid net 90 days, and that sunk me.”8 ■
Table 12.2 shows how to calculate the additional cash required to support an increase in 
sales.
The first step in managing cash more effectively is to understand the company’s cash flow 
cycle—the time lag between paying suppliers for merchandise or materials and receiving pay-
ment from customers after they sell the product or service (see Figure 12.3). The longer this cash 
flow cycle, the more likely the business owner will encounter a cash crisis. Small companies, 
especially those that buy from or sell to larger businesses, are finding that their cash flow cycles 
are growing longer as large companies have stretched their invoice payment times to suppliers
and decreased their invoice collection times from customers to improve their cash flow. A recent 
study by REL Consultancy shows that large companies, those with more than $5 billion in annual 
sales, have an average days’ sales outstanding (DSO) of 41 days but an average days’ payable 
outstanding (DPO) of 55.8 days (a difference of −14.8 days). The numbers for small companies, 
those with less than $500 million in annual sales, show the “cash squeeze” that large compa-
nies are putting them in: Their DSO is 58.9 days, and their DPO is 40.1 days (a difference of 
18.8 days).9
TABLE 12.1 Signs of an Impending Cash Flow Crisis
Following are signs that a company may be on the verge of a cash crisis:
● 
Excess supplies of inventory
● 
Large stock of “old” inventory items that never sold
● 
Significant volume of fixed asset purchases, such as machinery and equipment
● 
Accounts receivable that are past due
● 
Failing to take advantage of cash discounts from vendors and suppliers
● 
Late payments to vendors and suppliers
● 
Missed quarterly tax payments
● 
Past due loan payments
● 
Above average interest expense because of excessive business debt
● 
Average collection period ratio that is above the industry median
● 
Missed sales because popular inventory items are out of stock
● 
Difficulty meeting payroll on time
● 
Rapid increase in business expenses
● 
Rapid increase in accounts receivable balance
●

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Once entrepreneurs understand their companies’ cash flow cycle, the next step in effective 
cash management is to analyze it, looking for ways to reduce its length. For the company whose 
cash flow is illustrated in Figure 12.3, reducing the cycle from 240 days to, say, 150 days would 
free up incredible amounts of cash that this company could use to finance growth and dramati-
cally reduce its borrowing costs. What steps do you suggest the owner of this business take to
reduce its cash flow cycle?
Preparing a cash forecast that recognizes this cycle helps to avoid a cash crisis. Under-
standing the cash flow patterns of a business over the course of a year is essential to creating a 
successful cash management strategy. Business owners should calculate their cash flow cycles 
whenever they prepare their financial statements (or at least quarterly). On a daily basis, business

TABLE 12.2 How Much Cash Is Required to Support an Increase in Sales?
Too often, entrepreneurs believe that increasing sales is the ideal solution to a cash crunch, only to 
discover (often after it is too late) that it takes extra cash to support extra sales. The following worksheet 
demonstrates how to calculate the amount of additional cash required to support an increase in sales.
To make the calculation, a business owner needs the following information:
● 
The increase in sales planned ($)
● 
The time frame for adding new sales (days)
● 
The company’s gross profit margin, gross profit ÷ net sales (%)
● 
The estimated additional expenses required to generate additional sales ($)
● 
The company’s average collection period (days)
To calculate the amount of additional cash needed, use the following formula:
Extra cash required = [(New sales − Gross profit + Extra overhead) × (Average collection period 
× 1.20*)] ÷ (Time frame in days for adding new sales)
Consider the following example:
The owner of Ardent Company wants to increase sales by $75,000 over the next year. The company’s 
gross profit margin is 30 percent of sales (so its gross profit on these additional sales would be $75,000 
× 30% = $22,500), its average collection period is 47 days, and managers estimate that generating the 
additional sales will require an increase in expenses of $21,300. To calculate the additional cash that 
Ardent will need to support this higher level of sales, use the following formula:
Extra cash required = [($75,000 − $22,500 + 21,300) × (47 × 1.2)] ÷ 365 = $11,404
Ardent will need $11,404 in extra cash to support the additional sales of $75,000 it plans to bring in 
over the next year.
*The extra 20 percent is added as a cushion.

owners should generate a report showing the following items: total cash on hand, bank balance, 
a summary of the day’s sales, a summary of the day’s cash receipts, a summary of the day’s cash 
disbursements, and a summary of accounts-receivable collections. Compiling these reports into 
monthly summaries provides the foundation for making reliable cash forecasts and enables en-
trepreneurs to understand the rhythm of their companies’ cash flow.
Cash and Profits Are Not the Same
As important as earning a profit is, a company’s survival depends on its ability to generate posi-
tive cash flow. Attempting to discern the status of a small company’s cash position by analyzing
its profitability is futile; profitability is not necessarily highly correlated with cash flow. Entre

preneurs often equivocate higher sales with better cash flow, but that is usually not the case. In 
fact, a company can be growing and earning a profit and still be forced to close its doors because 
it runs out of cash. For instance, say that a company sells $5,000 of merchandise on credit. 
The sale shows up as revenue on the income statement, but the company’s cash balance does 
not increase until it actually collects (if it ever collects) the account receivable, which may be 
months later. An income statement does not tell an entrepreneur anything about the condition of 
the company’s cash flow. “The stumbling block is that a lot of organizations have a hard time 
getting their arms around cash management and understanding it operationally,” says John Cum-
mings, a consultant at KPMG who advises companies on cash management strategies. “They’re
so used to a profit-and-loss statement world and do not understand the implications of cash flow 
on operations.”10
In addition, slow sales also spell problems for a company’s cash flow, but in a different way. 
When sales falter, cash flows in more slowly, which means that the company has less cash to
cover its required payments. The result, however, is still the same: a cash crisis. Jay Goltz, owner 
of five successful art-related and home décor businesses in Chicago, says, “I am dealing with 
cash flow issues because sales are off, thanks to record snowfall and subzero temperatures, and 
because we started buying direct from all over the world in bigger quantities—in some cases a

year’s worth of merchandise. Eventually, this will mean better [profit] margins, a better selection
of products, and way more inventory than I had last year at this time, but at the moment, it also 
means I have way less cash. I am still able to pay the bills, but I have learned that it is always
better to have as much cash available as possible.”11
Profit (or net income) is the difference between a company’s total revenue and its total ex-
penses. It measures how efficiently a business is operating. Cash is the money that is free and
readily available to use in a business. Cash flow is a measure of a company’s liquidity and repre-
sents the balance of cash payments that flow into and out of a company over a particular period 
of time. Many small business owners soon discover that profitability does not guarantee liquidity.
As important as earning a profit is, no business owner can pay suppliers, creditors, employees,
government entities, and lenders in profits; that requires cash! Many entrepreneurs focus on their 
company’s earnings because they know that a company must earn a profit to stay in business.
However, adequate cash flow also is essential because it represents the money that flows through 
a business in a continuous cycle without being tied up in any other asset. “Businesses fail not 
because they are making or losing money,” warns one financial expert, “but because they simply 
run out of cash.”12 A recent survey by Visa Small Business reports that 39 percent of small busi-
ness owners cite cash flow management as a major or critical concern.13
Figure 12.4 shows the flow of cash through a typical small business. Cash flow is the vol-
ume of actual cash that comes into and goes out of the business during an accounting period.
Decreases in cash occur when the business purchases, on credit or for cash, goods for inventory 
or materials for use in production. A business sells the resulting inventory either for cash or on 
credit. When a company takes in cash or collects payments on accounts receivable, its cash bal-
ance increases. Notice that purchases for inventory and production lead sales; that is, a company
d
typically pays these bills before sales are generated. On the other hand, collection of accounts 
receivable lags behind sales; that is, customers who purchase goods on credit do not pay until
after the sale, sometimes months later.
The Cash Budget
The need for a cash budget arises because in every business the cash flowing in is rarely “in 
sync” with the cash flowing out of the business. This uneven flow of cash creates periodic cash
surpluses and shortages, making it necessary for entrepreneurs to track the flow of cash through 
their businesses so that they can project realistically the cash available throughout the year.
Many entrepreneurs operate their businesses without knowing the pattern of their cash flows, 
believing that the process is too complex or time consuming. In reality, entrepreneurs simply 
cannot afford to disregard the process of cash management. They must ensure that their busi-
nesses have on hand an adequate but not excessive supply of cash to meet their operating needs.

CHAPTER 12 • MANAGING CASH FLOW
465
The goal of cash management is to have enough cash available to meet the company’s cash 
needs at a given time.
How much cash is enough? What is suitable for one business may be totally inadequate for 
another, depending on each firm’s size, nature, seasonal pattern of sales, and particular situation. 
The small business manager should prepare a cash budget, which is nothing more than a “cash 
map” showing the amount and the timing of the cash receipts and the cash disbursements day by 
day, week by week, or month by month. It is used to predict the amount of cash a company will 
need to operate smoothly over a specific period of time, and it is a valuable tool in managing 
a company successfully. A cash budget can illuminate a host of approaching problems, giving 
entrepreneurs adequate time to handle or, better yet, avoid them. A cash budget reveals important 
clues about how well a company balances its accounts payable and accounts receivable, controls
inventory, finances its growth, and makes use of the cash it has.
Typically, small business owners should prepare a projected monthly cash budget for at least 
one year into the future and quarterly estimates for another. The forecast must cover all seasonal 
sales fluctuations. The more variable a firm’s sales pattern, the shorter should be its planning 
horizon. For example, a company whose sales fluctuate widely over a relatively short time frame 
might require a weekly cash budget. The key is to track cash flow over time. The timing of a 
company’s cash flow is as important as the amounts. “An alert cash flow manager keeps an eye 
not on cash receipts or on cash demands as average quantities but on cash as a function of the 
calendar,” says one business owner.14
Creating a written cash plan is not an excessively time-consuming task and can help the
owner to avoid unexpected cash shortages, a situation that can cause a business to fail. Some-
one in the company should have the responsibility of forecasting and tracking the company’s 
cash flow. If the entrepreneur delegates the task to an employee, he or she must be sure that the 
employee is trained to do the job properly. Joanna Norris, a partner in the Ratio Law Firm in 
Manchester, England, says that although the firm’s cash disbursements tend to be predictable, 
its cash receipts can be quite variable, which makes daily cash management an essential task.
She and her partners have trained their office manager to track the practice’s cash flow every day
to ensure that the law firm always has sufficient cash on hand.15 Preparing a cash budget helps 
business owners avoid nasty cash flow surprises. Most entrepreneurs rely on computer spread-
sheets such as Microsoft Excel and others to track their cash flow and to forecast cash receipts 
and disbursements, but popular small business accounting software includes cash management 
tools that require very little time and effort and produce reliable results. Many accounting soft-
ware makers offer cloud-based applications that include cash management modules for less than 
$20 per month. A recent survey by bill.com, an online bill payment company, reports that 
73 percent of small businesses rely on spreadsheets to manage their cash flow and 8.5 percent use
an integrated accounting system. Alarmingly, the survey also shows that 8.3 percent track their 
companies’ cash flow “in their heads,” and 10.3 percent of business owners do not use any cash
management tools at all.16
A cash budget is based on the cash method of accounting, meaning that cash receipts and
cash disbursements are recorded in the forecast only when the cash transaction is expected to take
place. For example, credit sales to customers are not reported as cash receipts until the company 
expects to collect the cash from them. Similarly, purchases made on credit are not recorded until 
the owner expects to pay them. Because depreciation, bad-debt expense, and other noncash items 
involve no cash transfers, they are omitted entirely from the cash budget.
A cash budget is nothing more than a forecast of the firm’s cash inflows and outflows for 
a specific time period, and it will never be completely accurate. However, it does give an entre-
preneur a clear picture of a company’s estimated cash balance for the period, pointing out when 
it may require external cash infusions or when surplus cash balances are available to invest. In 
addition, by comparing actual cash flows with projections, an entrepreneur can revise the forecast 
so that future cash budgets will be more accurate.

Formats for preparing a cash budget vary depending on the pattern of a company’s cash flow. 
Table 12.3 shows a most likely monthly cash budget for a small department store over a six-month 
period. (Creating pessimistic and optimistic cash forecasts is a snap once the most likely cash bud-
get is in place.) Each monthly column should be divided into two sections—estimated and actual 
(not shown)—so that each succeeding cash forecast can be updated to reflect actual cash flows.
(The Service Corps of Retired Executives provides a handy set of templates, including one for fore-
casting cash flow, on its Web site at www.score.org/resources/business-plans-financial-statements-
template-gallery.) Comparing forecasted amounts to actual cash flows and learning the causes of 
any significant discrepancies allows entrepreneurs to improve the accuracy of future cash budgets.

TABLE 12.3 Cash Budget for a Small Department Store (continued)
d
Creating a cash budget requires five basic steps:
1. Determining an adequate minimum cash balance
2. Forecasting sales
3. Forecasting cash receipts
4. Forecasting cash disbursements
5. Estimating the end-of-month cash balance

468
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Step 1: Determining an Adequate Minimum Cash Balance
What is considered an excessive cash balance for one small business may be inadequate for 
another, even though the two companies are in the same industry. Some suggest that a firm’s cash 
balance should equal at least one-fourth of its current liabilities, but this general rule clearly will 
not work for all small businesses. Many financial experts recommend that businesses build a cash 
reserve or contingency fund large enough to cover three to six months’ of operating expenses. 
Highly seasonal businesses often require an even larger reserve fund, one large enough to cover 
its expenses for both its busy and “off” seasons.
The most reliable method of deciding the right minimum cash balance is based on past expe-
rience. Past operating records will indicate the cash cushion an entrepreneur needs to cover any 
unexpected expenses after all normal cash outlays are deducted from the month’s cash receipts. 
For example, past records may indicate that it is desirable to maintain a cash balance equal to 
five days’ sales. Seasonal fluctuations may cause a firm’s minimum cash balance to change. For 
example, the minimum cash balance for a retailer may be greater in June than in December.
Step 2: Forecasting Sales
The heart of the cash budget is the sales forecast. It is the central factor in creating an accurate 
picture of the firm’s cash position because sales ultimately are transformed into cash receipts and 
cash disbursements. For most businesses, sales constitute the primary source of the cash flowing 
into the business. Similarly, sales of merchandise require that cash be used to replenish inven-
tory. As a result, the cash budget is only as accurate as the sales forecast from which it is derived.
For an established business, a sales forecast is based on past sales, but owners must be care-
ful not to be excessively optimistic in projecting sales. Economic swings, increased competition,
fluctuations in demand, normal seasonal variations, weather, and other factors can drastically 
affect sales patterns and, therefore, a company’s cash flow. Most businesses, from retailers and 
hotels to accounting firms and builders, have sales patterns that are “lumpy” and not evenly dis-
tributed throughout the year.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Katherine Hudson: The Arabian Tent Company
The Arabian Tent Company, a business that Katherine Hudson, launched in 2004 
and operates from her home in East Sussex, England, provides luxurious tents and decora-
tions for outdoor weddings, parties, and festivals. Hudson’s business is highly seasonal, 
with almost all of the company’s sales occurring between April and September; sales dur-
ing the remaining six months of the year are lean. To accommodate the seasonality of her
business’s cash flow, Hudson requires customers to pay a 25 percent deposit when they 
book the event and second 25 percent deposit on January 1 of the year of the event. She
also has launched a complementary business that provides furniture rental and decorat-
ing services for indoor events, particularly during the holiday season. Hudson recently 
began shipping half of her company’s tents to Australia during the winter (which is Aus-
tralia’s summer) to help fill the seasonal gap in her company’s cash flow.18 ■
Many small retailers generate most of their sales and as much as one-third of their 
profits in the months of November and December. For instance, 40 percent of all toy sales 
take place in the last six weeks of the year, and companies that make fruitcakes typically 
generate 50 to 90 percent of their sales during the holiday season.19 The typical wine and 
spirits shop makes 15 to 18 percent of its total sales volume for the entire year between 
December 15 and December 31.20 Companies that sell television sets and recliners see sales surge
in the weeks before the Super Bowl, and Super Bowl Sunday is the busiest day of the year for 
pizza restaurants, producing revenues that are five times that of a typical Sunday.21 For fireworks 
companies, the three weeks before July 4 account for the majority of annual sales with another 
smaller peak occurring before New Year’s Eve.22 Costume makers generate almost all of their 
sales before Halloween but must invest in the raw materials and the labor to make the costumes 
in the spring and summer months, when their cash balances are at their lowest.23 For companies 
with highly seasonal sales patterns, proper cash management is an essential activity.
Several quantitative techniques that are beyond the scope of this text (linear regression,
multiple regression, time-series analysis, and exponential smoothing) are available to owners 
of existing businesses with an established sales pattern for forecasting sales. These methods
The Arabian Tent Company

CHAPTER 12 • MANAGING CASH FLOW
469
enable the small business owner to extrapolate past and present sales trends to arrive at accurate 
sales forecasts.
The task of forecasting sales for a start-up is more difficult but not impossible. For example, 
the entrepreneur might conduct research on similar firms and their sales patterns in the first year 
of operation to come up with a forecast. The local chamber of commerce and trade associations in 
various industries also collect such information. Publications such as the Annual Statement Studies
published by the Risk Management Association (RMA) and BizMiner, which profile financial
statements for companies of all sizes in hundreds of industries, are also useful tools. Market re-
search is another source of information that may be used to estimate annual sales for a start-up. 
Other potential sources that may help to predict sales include census reports, newspapers, radio 
and television customer profiles, polls and surveys, and local government statistics. Talking with
owners of similar businesses (outside the local trading area, of course) can provide entrepreneurs 
with realistic estimates of start-up sales. Table 12.4 provides an example of how one entrepreneur 
used such marketing information to derive a sales forecast for his first year of operation.
No matter what techniques entrepreneurs employ, they must recognize that even the best sales 
estimates will be wrong. Many financial analysts suggest that the owner create three estimates—
an optimistic, a pessimistic, and a most likely sales estimate—and then make a separate cash 
budget for each forecast (a very simple task with a spreadsheet). This dynamic forecast enables the 
owner to determine the range within which his or her sales will likely be as the year progresses.
Step 3: Forecasting Cash Receipts
As you learned earlier, sales constitute the primary source of cash receipts. When a company sells
goods and services on credit, the cash budget must account for the delay between the sale and 
the actual collection of the proceeds. Remember: entrepreneurs cannot spend cash they haven’t 
collected! For instance, an appliance store might not collect the cash from a refrigerator sold in 
February until April or May, and the cash budget must reflect this delay. To project accurately 
cash receipts, an entrepreneur must analyze accounts receivable to determine the company’s 
collection pattern. For example, past records may indicate that 20 percent of sales are for cash, 
50 percent are paid in the month following the sale, 20 percent are paid two months after the sale, 
5 percent are paid after three months, and 5 percent are never collected. In addition to cash and
credit sales, a small business may receive cash in a number of forms—interest income, rental 
income, dividends, and others.
TABLE 12.4 Forecasting Sales for a Business Start-Up
Robert Adler wants to open a repair shop for imported cars. The trade association for automotive
garages estimates that the owner of an imported car spends an average of $485 per year on repairs 
and maintenance. The typical garage attracts its clientele from a trading zone (the area from which a 
business draws its customers) with a 20-mile radius. Census reports show that the families within a 
20-mile radius of Robert’s proposed location own 84,000 cars, of which 24 percent are imports. Based 
on a local consultant’s market research, Robert believes he can capture 9.9 percent of the market this 
year. Robert’s estimate of his company’s first year’s sales are as follows:
Number of cars in trading zone
84,000 autos
× Percent of imports
× 24 %
= Number of imported cars in trading zone
20,160 imports
Number of imports in trading zone
20,160 imports
× Average expenditure on repairs and maintenance
× $485
= Total import repair sales potential
$9,777,600
Total import repair sales potential
$9,777,600
× Estimated share of the market
× 9.9%
= Sales estimate
$967,982
Now Robert Adler can convert this annual sales estimate of $967,982 into monthly sales estimates for 
use in his company’s cash budget.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Bruce Schofield and his wife Lucy purchased Good Intents in 
2003 from the company founders, who were retiring. With hard
work and sound management, the copreneurs have tripled the
company’s sales since they purchased it. The company, located 
in Ledbury, Herefordshire, England, provides aluminum-framed
marquees and furnishings, which range from tables and chairs
to illuminated bars and dance floors, for anniversaries, parties, 
and corporate, school, and university events. Its primary market, 
though, is weddings, which means that 75 percent of its sales 
take place between April and September. Not only does gearing 
up for the busy wedding season blitz require lots of advance plan-
ning, but it also demands some clever cash management tech-
niques, particularly for the slower off-season. Even though sales 
are concentrated in just a few months of the year, Good Intents’s
expenses continue year-round. Good Intents’s biggest expense is
labor. To control labor costs, the Schofields employ a lean staff of 
four full-time employees, whom they keep busy during the slow 
winter season cleaning, repairing, and organizing equipment.
During the busy season, they hire as many as eight part-time
employees to handle the heavy volume of work. The Schofields 
also market the superior quality of their tents and heaters to their 
customers for off-season events. In addition, they require clients 
to pay a 25 percent deposit at booking and collect the balance
owed before the event takes place so that they do not have to 
waste time chasing unpaid invoices. They also offer clients a small 
discount for early payment.
As the Schofields have learned, seasonal businesses are far 
more difficult to manage than those that generate sales and cash 
year-round. How can business owners whose companies face
highly seasonal sales patterns manage the uneven cash flow?
•
Be financially disciplined. Seasonal business owners must 
establish a realistic budget, stick to it, and avoid the tempta-
tion to spend lavishly when cash flow is plentiful. Teevan 
McManus, owner of the Coronado Surfing Academy in San 
Diego, failed to heed this advice in his first year of business. 
“I burned through everything I made in the summer and 
was living off of my business line of credit before the next 
season came around,” he recalls. “I barely made it to the 
next June.”
•
Manage your time and your employees’ time carefully. 
During the busy season, employees may be working over-
time to serve the rush of customers; during the off-season, 
a business owner may cut back to 20-hour workweeks or 
operate with a skeleton crew.
•
Use permanent employees sparingly. Many owners 
of seasonal businesses use a small core of permanent em-
ployees and then hire part-time workers or student interns
during their busy season. Planning for the right number of 
seasonal employees and recruiting them early ensures that a 
business will be able to serve its customers properly.
•
Put aside cash in a separate account that you use only 
for the lean months of your seasonal business. 
•
Maximize your productivity in the off-season. Use the 
slow season to conduct market research, perform routine 
maintenance and repairs, revise your Web site, and stay in 
touch with customers. Steve Kopelman’s company, Haunted
House.com, earns all of its $2.6 million in annual revenue 
in a six-week period leading up to Halloween. Starting in 
November, Kopelman surveys his customers so that he can 
refine his marketing efforts for the next season and solicit 
suggestions for improvement. He visits trade shows to look 
for the latest technology and gadgets to keep his haunted 
houses fresh and exciting for his customers. Kopelman also 
negotiates leases on properties for the next season and 
studies his competition by visiting every haunted house Web 
site he can find.
•
Keep inventory at minimal levels during the off-
season. As you will learn in this chapter, holding inventory 
unnecessarily merely ties up valuable cash uselessly.
•
Negotiate payment terms with vendors that are 
synchronized with your company’s cash flow. Schedule 
payments to vendors so that they coincide with your 
company’s cash peaks rather than its cash valleys.
•
Offer off-peak discounts. Doing so may generate some 
revenue during slow periods.
•
Consider starting a complementary seasonal business. 
The weeks leading up to Halloween are the peak season for 
Sam Fard, owner of Los Angeles–based Roma Costume, a 
manufacturer of costumes for women. To reduce the highly 
seasonal nature of his business, Fard added a line of bikinis 
and lingerie to his company’s product mix.
•
Create a cash flow forecast. Perhaps one of the most 
important steps that seasonal business owners can take is 
to develop a forecast of their companies’ cash flow. Doing 
so allows them to spot patterns and trends and to make 
plans for covering inevitable cash shortages. Make sure that 
you include a pessimistic or worst-case scenario in your cash 
forecast.
•
Establish a bank line of credit. The line of credit should 
be large enough to cover at least three months’ worth of 
expenses. Use your cash flow forecast to show the banker 
how and when your company will be able to repay the loan. 
A good cash forecast “shows the banker that you know 
exactly where the peaks and valleys are and what your cash 
needs are,” says one banker.

Collecting accounts receivable promptly poses problems for many small companies. Figure 12.5 
demonstrates the importance of acting promptly once an account becomes past due. Notice 
how the probability of collecting an outstanding account diminishes the longer the account is 
delinquent. Table 12.5 illustrates a concept of which many business owners are not aware: the 
high cost of failing to collect accounts receivable on time.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ron Box: Joe Money Machinery Ron Box, chief finan-
cial officer of Joe Money Machinery, a family-owned reseller of heavy construction equip-
ment in Birmingham, Alabama, has watched as the company’s large customers, mainly construction 
firms and municipal governments, stretch out payment times on their invoices to 60 or more days, 
a practice that puts pressure on the small company’s cash flow. In an attempt to speed up collec-
tions, Box recently began offering customers cash discounts for early payments. About 30 percent
of Joe Money Machinery’s customers have taken advantage of the discounts, “but they don’t 
always do it,” says Box. The company also has encouraged customers to pay with corporate credit 
cards, but that option has had limited success.24 ■
Many banks now offer cash management tools designed to speed up the collection of in-
voices to small companies that once were reserved only for large businesses. Once set up with a
bank, electronic (Automated Clearing House) collections automatically deduct invoice amounts
from customers’ accounts and deposit them into the seller’s account within 24 hours. Businesses
can use electronic collections for single or periodic transactions, but they are ideal for recurring 
transactions. Remote deposit, which allows businesses to scan customers’ checks (still the most

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
using a check scanner (often provided by the bank at little or no charge), a smart phone, or a tablet,
is becoming increasingly popular among small businesses. Scanned checks create an online, digi-
tal deposit that eliminates time-consuming runs to the bank and gets customers’ payments into the
business’s account faster. Banks typically charge a monthly fee and a flat amount for each scanned 
check to provide the remote deposit service. Entrepreneurs should compare the benefits and the 
costs of these services at various banks, which provide a daily list of transactions to allow entre-
preneurs to reconcile payments with their accounts-receivable records. Although only 5 percent 
of small businesses currently use remote deposit, banks expect that percentage to grow rapidly as 
business owners become more technologically savvy and more banks offer the service.25
Step 4: Forecasting Cash Disbursements
Entrepreneurs must have sufficient cash on hand to pay their bills as they come due (see Figure 12.6). 
Every entrepreneur should know his or her company’s monthly “burn rate,” the amount of cash it 
spends each month. Fortunately, most owners of established businesses can easily develop a clear 
picture of their companies’ pattern of cash disbursements. Many cash payments, such as rent,
loan repayments, and interest, are fixed amounts due on specified dates; others, such as purchases
of goods and services, vary from one month to another. The key factor when forecasting disburse-
ments for a cash budget is to record them in the month in which they will be paid, not when the
obligation is incurred. Of course, the number of cash disbursements varies with each particular 
business, but the following disbursement categories are common: purchase of inventory or raw 
materials, wages and salaries, rent, utilities, taxes, loan payments, interest, advertising, fixed-
asset purchases, and miscellaneous expenses.
When preparing a cash budget, one of the worst mistakes an entrepreneur can make is to 
underestimate cash disbursements, which can result in a cash crisis. To prevent this, wise entre-
preneurs cushion their cash disbursement estimates, assuming they will be higher than expected. 
This is particularly important for entrepreneurs opening new businesses. In fact, some financial
analysts recommend that new owners estimate cash disbursements as best they can and then add
another 25 to 50 percent of the total! (Remember Murphy’s Law?)
TABLE 12.5 The High Cost of Slow Payers
Are your customers who purchase on credit paying late? If so, these outstanding accounts receivable 
represent a significant leak in your company’s cash flow. Slow-paying customers, in effect, are 
borrowing money from your business interest free. One experienced business owner says, “Whether 
you realize it or not, you’re sort of a banker, and you need to start thinking like one . . . to assess the
quality of your [customers’ accounts].” Slow-paying customers are using your money without paying 
you interest while you forgo opportunities to place it in interest-earning investments or pay interest on
money that you must borrow to replace the missing funds. Exactly how much is poor credit control 
costing your company? The answer may surprise you.
The first step is to calculate your company’s average collection period ratio (see the section 
“Operating Ratios” in Chapter 9). The second step is to age your accounts receivable to determine how 
many accounts are current and how many are overdue. The following example shows how to use these
numbers to calculate the cost of past-due accounts for a company whose credit terms are “net 30”:
Average collection period
65 days
− Credit terms
−30 days
Excess in accounts receivable
35 days
Average daily sales of $21,500* × 35 days
$752,500
× Normal rate of return
× 8%
Annual cost of excess
$60,200
Slow-paying customers are costing this company more than $60,000 a year! If your business is highly 
seasonal, quarterly or monthly figures may be more meaningful than annual ones.
*Average daily sales = Annual sales ÷ 365 days = $7,847,500 ÷ 365 = $21,500 per day

Percentage of Small Business Owners Who Cite Problem as “Critical”
Problem
Sometimes business owners have difficulty developing initial forecasts of cash receipts and 
cash disbursements. One of the most effective techniques for overcoming the “I don’t know 
where to begin” hurdle is to make a daily list of the items that generated cash (receipts) and those 
that consumed it (disbursements).
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Susan Bowen: Champion Awards Susan Bowen, CEO of
Champion Awards, a $9 million T-shirt screen printer, monitors cash flow by tracking the 
cash that flows into and out of her company every day. Focusing on keeping the process simple, 
Bowen sets aside a few minutes each morning to track updates from the previous day on four key 
numbers:
Accounts receivable:
1. What did we bill yesterday?
2. How much did we actually collect?
Accounts payable:
1. What invoices did we receive yesterday?
2. How much in total did we pay out?
If Bowen observes the wrong trend—more new bills than new sales or more money going out 
than coming in—she makes immediate adjustments to protect her cash flow. The benefits pro-
duced (not the least of which is the peace of mind in knowing that no cash crisis is looming) more 
than outweigh the 10 minutes she invests in the process every day. “I’ve tried to balance my books 
every single day since I started my company in 1970,” says Bowen.26 ■
Step 5: Estimating the End-of-Month Cash Balance
To estimate a company’s cash balance for each month, entrepreneurs first must determine the 
cash balance at the beginning of each month. The beginning cash balance includes cash on hand 
as well as cash in checking and savings accounts. As development of the cash budget progresses, 

474
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
the cash balance at the end of one month becomes the 
d
beginning balance for the following month. 
Next, the owner adds to the beginning balance the projected total cash receipts and subtracts the 
projected total cash disbursements to obtain the end-of-month balance before any borrowing 
takes place. A positive amount indicates that the firm has a cash surplus for the month, but a 
negative amount shows that a cash shortage will occur unless the owner is able to collect, raise,
or borrow additional funds.
Normally, a company’s cash balance fluctuates from month to month, reflecting seasonal 
sales patterns in the business. These fluctuations are normal, but business owners must watch 
closely for trends in the cash balance over time. A trend of increases indicates that a company is 
solvent; on the other hand, a pattern of cash decreases should alert the owner that the business is
approaching a cash crisis. One easy but effective tracking technique is to calculate the company’s 
monthly cash surplus or deficit (cash receipts minus cash disbursements) at the bottom of the 
cash budget (see Table 12.3). Strings of deficits (and the declining cash balance that results from 
them) should set off alarms that a company is headed for a cash crisis.
Preparing a cash budget not only illustrates the flow of cash into and out of the small busi-
ness but also allows the owner to anticipate cash shortages and cash surpluses. “Then,” explains 
a small business consultant, “you can go to the bank and get a ‘seasonal’ line of credit for six 
months instead of twelve. Right there you can cut your borrowing costs in half.”27 By planning
cash needs ahead of time, a small business can achieve the following benefits:
● Increase the amount and the speed of cash flowing into the company
● Reduce the amount and the speed of cash flowing out of the company
● Make the most efficient use of available cash
● Take advantage of money-saving opportunities, such as quantity and cash discounts
● Finance seasonal business needs
● Develop a sound borrowing program
● Develop a workable program of debt repayment
● Impress lenders and investors with its ability to plan and repay financing
● Provide funds for expansion
● Plan for investing surplus cash
“Cash flow spells survival for every business,” claims one expert. “Manage cash flow effec-
tively, and your business works. If your cash flow is not well managed, then sooner or later your 
business goes under. It’s that simple.”28 Unfortunately, most small business owners forgo these
benefits because they fail to track their company’s cash flow consistently. Because cash flow 
problems usually sneak up on a business over time, improper cash management often proves 
to be a costly—and fatal—mistake. Entrepreneurs cannot track their companies’ cash flow “in
their heads.” There are too many variables involved, including cash sales, credit sales, collections 
from credit sales, inventory purchases, invoice due dates, seasonal and cyclical fluctuations, and
others. Trying to manage a company’s cash without a system to record and report receipts and 
disbursements is like a juggler who can juggle three balls but is overwhelmed as the number of 
balls increases. One way to avoid this pitfall is to establish a weekly report that shows the amount 
of cash on hand, the cash received, and the cash spent. Some entrepreneurs also monitor the sta-
tus of the company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable balances weekly.
The “Big Three” of Cash Management
It is unrealistic for business owners to expect to trace the flow of every dollar through their busi-
nesses. However, by concentrating on the three primary causes of cash flow problems, they can 
dramatically lower the likelihood of experiencing a devastating cash crisis. The “big three” of 
cash management are accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory. These three variables 
are leading indicators of a company’s cash flow. If a company’s accounts receivable balance is

”I’ll never make that mistake again,” Douglas Martinez said to
himself as he got into his car. Martinez had just left a meeting with
his banker, who had not been optimistic about the chances of
Martinez’s plumbing supply company getting the loan it needed. 
“I should have been better prepared for the meeting,” he mut-
tered, knowing that he could be angry only at himself. “That 
consultant at the Small Business Development Center [SBDC] was 
right. Bankers’ primary concern when making loans is cash flow.”
”At least I salvaged the meeting by telling him I wasn’t ready 
to officially apply for a loan yet,” Martinez thought. “But I’ve got
a lot of work to do. I’ve got a week to figure out how to put to-
gether a cash budget to supplement my loan application. Maybe
that consultant can help me.”
When he returned to his office, Martinez gathered up the file 
folders containing all of his fast-growing company’s financial reports 
and printed his projected revenues and expenses using his computer 
spreadsheet. Then he called the SBDC consultant he had worked 
with when he was launching his company and explained the situa-
tion. When he arrived at the consultant’s office that afternoon, they
started organizing the information. Here is what they came up with:

increasing, its cash balance is probably declining. Similarly, accounts payable and inventory 
balances that are increasing faster than sales are signs of mounting pressure on a company’s 
cash flow. A good cash management “recipe” involves accelerating a company’s receivables to 
collect cash as quickly as possible, paying out cash as slowly as possible (without damaging the 
company’s credit rating), and maintaining an optimal level of inventory. The big three of cash 
management interact to create a company’s cash conversion cycle, the length of time required to 
convert inventory and accounts payable into sales and accounts receivable and finally back into 
cash. A company’s cash conversion cycle equals its days’ inventory outstanding + days’ sales
outstanding − days’ payable outstanding. Ideally, a company’s cash conversion cycle is negative, 
meaning that it turns over its inventory quickly and collects payments from its customers before it 
pays its vendors and suppliers. Amazon Inc. enjoys the benefits of a cash conversion cycle nega-
tive 14 days (see Figure 12.7).
Accounts Receivable
Selling merchandise and services on credit is a necessary evil for most small businesses. Many
customers expect to buy on credit, and business owners extend it to avoid losing customers to
competitors. However, selling to customers on credit is expensive; it requires more paperwork,

more staff, and more cash to service accounts receivable. In addition, because extending credit is,
in essence, lending money, the risk involved is higher. Every business owner who sells on credit 
encounters customers who pay late or, worst of all, never pay at all. A recent survey by Visa Small 
Business reports that the most common cash management challenge for small business owners 
(36 percent) is collecting accounts receivable. Software publisher Intuit shows that the average 
small business encounters an average of $5,140 in past-due accounts receivable per month.29
Caneum, a company based in Newport Beach, California, that provided IT services to businesses 
and government agencies, experienced a cash crisis when California’s legislature failed to pass
a budget, which meant that one of the company’s major clients, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, could not pay the invoice for $660,000 worth of work that Caneum had done. When 
another client, whom Caneum had billed for $750,000, was late making its payment, Caneum’s
cash balance could not recover, and the company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation).30
Most small companies operate with very thin cash reserves, and many lack reliable access 
to credit; therefore, a late payment from a major customer can create a cash crisis. Many busi-
ness owners speculate that the last recession caused a permanent shift to longer payment terms,
especially among large businesses. Before the recession, large companies often paid invoices in
30 to 45 days; now, they routinely take 60 to 100 days to pay them, but small business owners, 
who lack sufficient bargaining power with large customers, believe they are incapable of doing 
anything about it. Consumer goods giant Procter and Gamble, which makes $50 billion in pur-
chases annually from 75,000 suppliers, many of them small companies, recently told its vendors 
that it was extending its payment terms from 45 days to 75 days. Although the move freed up 
more than $2 billion in cash for P&G, the change has produced a ripple effect on its vendors, 
creating cash problems for many of them, especially small companies.31
A survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses reports that 74 percent of 
small companies have accounts receivable outstanding for 60 or more days.32 Slower payments 
from customers put more pressure on these small companies’ cash flow.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: David Schier: Jacobus Energy Jacobus Energy, a petro-
leum distribution company founded in 1919 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, faced the problem of
slowing receivables. The company had outgrown its manual system for tracking past-due accounts 
receivable, and nearly 9 percent of its accounts were more than 30 days past due. Credit manager 
David Schier switched to an online credit-checking and collection system, and the percentage of 
30-plus-day past-due accounts declined to just 3.3 percent. In addition, the company’s average col-
lection period ratio decreased from 27.3 days to 20.2 days, greatly improving its cash flow.33 ■
Selling on credit is a common practice in business. Experts estimate that 90 percent of in-
dustrial and wholesale sales are on credit and that 40 percent of retail sales are on account.34
Because credit sales are so prevalent, an assertive collection program is essential to managing a 
company’s cash flow. A credit policy that is too lenient can destroy a business’s cash flow, attract-
ing too many slow-paying or “deadbeat” customers who never pay. On the other hand, a care-
fully designed policy can be a powerful selling tool, attracting customers and boosting cash flow. 
Transforming accounts receivable into cash is essential to staying in business; entrepreneurs must 
remember that a sale does not count until they collect the cash from it! In other words, a business 
owner cannot use a $10,000 account receivable to meet the company’s payroll or pay its bills.
HOW TO ESTABLISH A CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY The first step in establishing a workable 
credit policy is to screen customers carefully before granting them credit. Unfortunately, many
small businesses neglect to conduct any kind of credit investigation before selling to a new 
customer. The first line of defense against bad-debt losses is a detailed credit application. Before 
selling to any customer on credit, a business owner should have the customer fill out a customized
application designed to provide the information needed to judge the potential customer’s
creditworthiness. At a minimum, this credit profile should include the following information
about customers:
● Name, address, tax identification number, and telephone number
● Form of ownership (proprietorship, S corporation, LLC, corporation, and so on) and
number of years in business

478

● Credit references (e.g., other suppliers), including contact names, addresses, and telephone 
numbers
● Bank and credit card references
After collecting this information, a business owner should use it to check the potential cus-
tomer’s credit references! The savings from lower bad-debt expenses can more than offset the
cost of using a credit reporting service. Companies such as Dun & Bradstreet (www.dnb.com), 
Experian (www.experian.com), Equifax (www.equifax.com), TransUnion (www.transunion
.com), and KnowX (www.knowx.com) enable entrepreneurs to gather credit information on
potential customers. For entrepreneurs who sell to other business, Dun & Bradstreet offers many 
useful services, including a Small Business Risk New Account Score, a tool for evaluating the
credit risk of new businesses. The National Association of Credit Management (www.nacm.org) 
is another important source of credit information because it collects information on many small
businesses that other reporting services ignore. The cost to check a potential customer’s credit at 
reporting services such as these starts at $40, a small price to pay when a small business is con-
sidering selling goods or services worth thousands of dollars to a new customer. Unfortunately, 
few small businesses take the time to conduct a credit check.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ron Phelps: Boulevard Tire Center Ron Phelps, com-
mercial credit manager at Boulevard Tire Center, a tire retailer with 26 locations in Florida, 
uses an online business credit reporting service called Cortera Pulse to screen new credit customers 
and to keep tabs on existing ones. Recently, when Pulse alerted Phelps that the Internal Revenue 
Service had imposed a large federal tax lien on one of its customers, Phelps immediately cut off 
the small trucking company’s credit, converting it to a “cash only” customer, to avoid the risk of 
writing off a bad debt.35 ■
The next step involves establishing a firm written credit policy and letting every customer 
know in advance the company’s credit terms. The credit agreement must be in writing and should 
specify a customer’s credit limit (which usually varies from one customer to another, depending 
on their credit ratings), any required deposits (often stated as a percentage of the purchase price), 
the terms of any discounts (e.g., a 2 percent discount if the invoice is paid within 10 days), and
the number of days before payment is due (immediately, 30 days, 60 days, and so on). A credit 
agreement should state clearly all the terms the business will enforce if the account goes bad,
including interest, late charges, attorney’s fees, and others. Failure to specify these terms up front 
in the contract so that the parties have a meeting of the minds means that they cannot be added 
t
later after problems arise. One entrepreneur compares credit customers to unruly children; unless
entrepreneurs set clear boundaries and enforce them, they can expect problems.36 To maximize
a small company’s cash flow, its credit policies should be as tight as possible (within federal and
state credit laws). Although the goal is to incur no bad debts, achieving that goal is unrealistic.
According to the American Collectors Association, if a business is writing off more than 5 percent 
of sales as bad debts, the owner should tighten its credit and collection policy.37
The third step in an effective credit policy is to send invoices promptly because customers 
rarely pay before they receive their bills. Unfortunately, 20 percent of small business owners 
admit that they forget to send invoices or follow up on past-due invoices.38 One recent survey of 
business owners in the United Kingdom estimates that forgotten invoices cost small businesses 
£3.7 billion per year.39 Remember: The sooner a company sends invoices, the sooner its custom-
ers will pay them.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Sam Goodner: Catapult Systems Sam Goodner, owner 
of Catapult Systems, an information technology (IT) consulting firm in Austin, Texas,
switched from billing his clients every 30 days to every 15 days when he realized the serious cash 
flow problems that the longer billing cycle created for his company. He continued to extend “net
30” credit terms, and more than 90 percent of the company’s clients never complained.40 ■
Manufacturers and wholesalers should make sure invoices are en route to customers as soon 
as the shipments go out the door (if not before). Service companies should keep track of bill-
able hours daily or weekly and bill as often as the contract with the client permits. Online or

pany bills a portion of its

of the month to smooth 
out uneven cash receipts.
computerized billing makes managing accounts receivable much easier, is less expensive, and
produces faster payments than paper invoices.41 However, only 34 percent of small businesses
use these programs.42 Some businesses use cycle billing, in which a company bills a portion of 
its credit customers each day or each week of the month, to smooth out uneven cash receipts.
Technology, such as cloud computing and smart phone apps, also can speed up a company’s 
collections. Laura Pendlebury, owner of Decorus Academy, a ballet school in Bedfordshire, 
England, was constantly chasing past due accounts from her students, which put pressure on her 
small company’s cash flow. Pendlebury could not afford to hire a bookkeeper or an administrative
assistant to help her, so she turned to a smart phone app called Zapper Scan-to-Pay. Pendlebury 
simply attaches to each invoice a QR code that contains each customer’s payment information. 
Customers simply scan the code with their phones, confirm the amount, and pay the invoice in 
just seconds.43
When an account becomes past due, a small business owner must take immediate
action. The longer an account is past due, the lower is the probability of collecting it. 
One of the most effective techniques is to have someone in the company who already 
has a relationship with the customer, perhaps a salesperson or a customer service rep-
resentative, contact him or her about the past-due account. The best approach is to start 
with a friendly reminder; getting “tough” too soon can damage the relationship with a 
good customer. When contacting a delinquent customer, the goal is to get a commit-
ment to pay the full amount of the bill by a specific date (not “soon” or “next week”).
t
Following up the personal contact with an e-mail or a letter that summarizes the verbal 
commitment also helps. If the customer still refuses to pay the bill, collection experts
recommend the following:
● Send a letter from the company’s attorney.
● Turn the account over to a collection attorney.
● As a last resort, hire a collection agency. The Commercial Law League of 
America (www.clla.org) can provide a list of reputable agencies.
Although collection agencies and attorneys typically take 25 to 30 percent of any 
accounts they collect, they are often worth the price. Companies turn over more than 
$200 billion annually in past-due debt to collection agencies, which collect about $55 billion for 
their clients.44 Seventy percent of the accounts turned over to collection agencies are considered 
“bad debts,” which are 90 days or more past due. According to the American Collectors Associa-
tion, only 5 percent of accounts more than 90 days delinquent will be paid voluntarily.
Business owners must be sure to abide by the provisions of the federal Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, which prohibits any kind of harassment when collecting debts (e.g., telephon-
ing repeatedly, issuing threats of violence, telling third parties about the debt, or using abusive 
language). The act also prevents collectors from making false statements and from contacting 
debtors at inconvenient times (e.g., before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m.) or places. The primary rule 
when collecting past-due accounts is “Never lose your cool.” Establishing a friendly but firm
r
attitude that treats customers with respect is more likely to produce payment than hostile threats. 
Table 12.6 outlines 10 collection blunders small business owners typically make and how to 
avoid them.
TECHNIQUES FOR ACCELERATING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Small business owners can rely on a
variety of other techniques to speed cash inflow from accounts receivable:
● Speed up orders by having customers e-mail or fax them to you.
● Send invoices when goods are shipped or when the job is completed—not a day or a week 
later; consider faxing or e-mailing invoices to reduce in-transit time to a minimum. Small 
business accounting software packages allow users to e-mail the invoices they generate.
When Jim Malarney, CEO of Vanguard Services, a company based in Indianapolis, Indiana, 
that provides contract truck drivers to companies, noticed that the company’s collections on
its accounts receivable were slowing, he began e-mailing invoices to customers. Malarney
also began establishing personal contacts with more people in the companies that Vanguard

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
TABLE 12.6 Ten Collection Blunders and How to Avoid Them
Business owners often make mistakes when trying to collect the money their customers owe. Checking 
potential credit customers’ credit records and creating a thorough sales contract that spells out exactly 
what happens if the account becomes past due can help minimize collection problems. Sooner or later, 
however, even the best system will encounter late payers. What happens then? Business owners should 
avoid these collection blunders.
Blunder 1: Delaying collection phone calls. Many entrepreneurs waste valuable time and resources 
sending four or five “past-due” letters to delinquent customers, usually with limited effectiveness.
Instead: Once a bill becomes past due, call the customer within a week to verify that he or she received 
the bill and that it is accurate. Ask for payment.
Blunder 2: Failing to ask for payment in clear terms. To avoid angering a customer, some entrepreneurs 
ask meekly, “Do you think you could take care of this bill soon?”
Instead: Firmly but professionally ask for payment (the full amount) by a specific date.
Blunder 3: Sounding desperate. Some entrepreneurs show weakness by saying that they must have 
payment or they “can’t meet payroll” or “can’t pay bills.” That gives the customer more leverage to 
negotiate additional discounts or time.
Instead: Ask for payment simply because the invoice is past due—without any other explanation. Don’t 
apologize for your request; it’s your money.
r
Blunder 4: Talking tough. Getting nasty with delinquent customers does not make them pay any faster 
and may be a violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act.
Instead: Remain polite and professional when dealing with past-due customers, even if you think they 
don’t deserve it. Never lose your temper. Don’t ruin your reputation by being rude.
r
Blunder 5: Trying to find out the customer’s problem. Some entrepreneurs think it is necessary to find 
out why a delinquent customer has not paid a bill.
Instead: Don’t waste time playing private investigator. Focus on the “business at hand,” collecting your 
money.
Blunder 6: Asking customers how much they can pay. When customers claim that they cannot pay the 
bill in full, inexperienced entrepreneurs ask, “Well, how much can you pay?” They don’t realize that 
they have just turned control of the situation over to the delinquent customer.
Instead: Take charge of negotiations from the outset. Let the customer know that you expect full 
payment. If you cannot get full payment immediately, suggest a new deadline. Only as a last resort 
should you offer an extended payment plan.
Blunder 7: Continuing to talk after you get a promise to pay. Some entrepreneurs “blow the deal” by 
not knowing when to stop talking. They keep interrogating a customer after they have a promise to pay.
Instead: Wrap up the conversation as soon as you have a commitment. Summarize the agreement, thank 
the customer, and end the conversation on a positive note.
Blunder 8: Calling without being prepared. Some entrepreneurs call customers without knowing 
exactly which invoices are past due and what amounts are involved. The effort is usually fruitless.
Instead: Have all account details in front of you when you call and be specific in your requests.
Blunder 9: Trusting your memory. Some entrepreneurs think they can remember previous collection 
calls, conversations, and agreements.
Instead: Keep accurate records of all calls and conversations. Take notes about each customer contact 
and resulting agreements.
Blunder 10: Letting your computer control your collection efforts. Inexperienced entrepreneurs tend to 
think that their computers can manage debt collection for them.
Instead: Recognize that a computer is a valuable tool in collecting accounts but that you are in control. 
“Past-due” notices from a computer may collect some accounts, but your efforts will produce more 
results. Getting to know the people who handle the invoices at your customers’ businesses can be a 
major advantage when collecting accounts.

serves. Vanguard’s collection strategy has resulted in the percentage of past-due accounts 
decreasing from 25 percent to just 8 percent.45
● Owners of service firms should offer clients retainer packages that provide their clients 
with a fixed number of hours of work each month that the client pays for in advance. To 
reduce the variability in her company’s cash flow, Yva Yorston, owner of Boost Busi-
ness Support, a company offering virtual assistance with administration, marketing, and 
research to small business owners, began offering clients retainer packages. On those ac-
counts, Yorston is paid in advance, and her company’s cash flow is much more predictable, 
giving her peace of mind.46
● Ensure that all invoices are clear, accurate, and timely. 
State clearly a description of the goods or services pur-
chased and an account number and make sure that the 
prices and the language on invoices agree with the price 
quotations on purchase orders or contracts.
● Include a telephone number and a contact person in 
your organization in case the customer has a question
or a dispute.
● Call the customer a week after sending the invoice to 
make sure it arrived and to ensure that the customer has
no problems with the quality of the product or service.
● Highlight the balance due and the terms of sale (e.g., 
“net 30”) on all invoices. A study by Xerox Corporation 
found that highlighting with color the “balance due” and “due date” sections of invoices
increased the speed of collection by 30 percent.47
● Allow customers to use multiple payment methods such as checks, credit cards, PayPal, 
money, orders, and cash.
● Offer incentives to encourage customers to pay invoices early and impose penalties on 
customers who pay late. Erika Napoletano, owner of RHW Media, a brand strategy firm 
in Denver, Colorado, recently instituted a payment policy that offers cash discounts to cli-
ents who pay early and establishes penalties for those who pay later than the agreed-upon 
terms. The incentives work; Napoletano says clients now pay early more often than not.48
● Restrict a customer’s credit until past-due bills are paid. Make sure salespeople know
which of their customers are behind in their payments.
● Deposit cash, checks, and credit card receipts daily.
● Identify the top 20 percent of your customers (by sales volume), create a separate file sys-
tem for them, and monitor them closely. Twenty percent of the typical company’s custom-
ers generate 80 percent of all accounts receivable.
● Ask customers to pay at least a portion of the purchase price up front. To protect her com-
pany’s cash flow, Erika Napoletano, owner of RHW Media, also requires a deposit of 
50 percent (sometimes more) on certain jobs before she starts them. “I’m ready to start for 
those customers who are ready to pay,” she says.49
● Watch for signs that a customer may be about to declare bankruptcy. If that happens, credi-
tors typically collect only a small fraction, if any, of the debt owed. If a customer does file 
for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court notifies all creditors with a “Notice of Filing” docu-
ment. If an entrepreneur receives one of these notices, he or she should create a file to track 
the events surrounding the bankruptcy and take action immediately. To have a valid claim 
against the debtor’s assets, a creditor must file a proof-of-claim form with the bankruptcy 
court within a specified time, often 90 days. If, after paying the debtor’s secured creditors, 
any assets remain, the court will distribute the proceeds to unsecured creditors who have 
legitimate proof of claim.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
● Use technology to manage cash flow. Cloud-based accounting packages also include mod-
ules that allow business owners to monitor their cash flow from anywhere on tablets, smart 
phones, or laptops.
● Track the results of the company’s collection efforts. Managers and key employees should 
receive a weekly report on the status of the company’s outstanding accounts receivable.
Another strategy that small companies, particularly those selling high-priced items, can use
to protect the cash they have tied up in receivables is to couple a security agreement with a financ-
ing statement. This strategy falls under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which 
governs a wide variety of business transactions, including the sale of goods and security interests.
A security agreement is a contract in which a business selling an asset on credit gets a security
interest in that asset (the collateral), protecting its legal rights in case the buyer fails to pay. To get 
the protection it seeks in the security agreement, the seller must file a financing statement called 
a UCC-1 form with the proper state or county office (a process the UCC calls “perfection”). 
The UCC-1 form gives notice to other creditors and to the general public that the seller holds a 
secured interest in the collateral named in the security agreement. The UCC-1 form must include 
the name, address, and signature of the buyer; a description of the collateral; and the name and 
address of the seller. If the buyer declares bankruptcy, the small business that sells the asset is not 
guaranteed payment, but the filing puts its claim to the asset ahead of those of unsecured credi-
tors. A small company’s degree of safety on a large credit sale is much higher with a security 
agreement and a properly filed financing statement than if it did not file the security agreement.
Accounts Payable
The second element of the big three of cash management is accounts payable. The timing of pay-
ables is just as crucial to proper cash management as the timing of receivables, but the objective
is exactly the opposite. Entrepreneurs should strive to stretch out payables as long as possible
without damaging their companies’ credit rating. Otherwise, suppliers may begin demanding 
prepayment or cash-on-delivery (C.O.D.) terms, which severely impair a company’s cash flow,
or they may stop doing business with it altogether. When Borders, once the second-largest book-
store chain in the United States, ran into cash flow problems, the company stopped making pay-
ments to book publishers, many of whom halted shipments to the book retailer. In an attempt to 
survive, Borders downsized to just 400 stores but ultimately succumbed to its cash flow woes, 
declared bankruptcy, and closed its doors for good.50 It is perfectly acceptable for small business 
owners to regulate payments to their companies’ advantage. Efficient cash managers set up a 
payment calendar each month that allows them to pay their bills on time and to take advantage of 
cash discounts for early payment.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Nancy Dunis: Dunis & Associates Nancy Dunis, CEO of 
Dunis & Associates, a Portland, Oregon, marketing firm, recognizes the importance of con-
trolling accounts payable. Dunis says that accounts payable are the key to keeping her company’s
cash flow running smoothly. She has set up a simple five-point accounts-payable system:
1. Set scheduling goals. Dunis strives to pay her company’s bills 45 days after receiving them 
and to collect all her receivables within 30 days. Even though customers do not always pay 
within 45 days, her goal is to collect her cash as close to 45 days as possible.
2. Keep paperwork organized. Dunis dates every invoice she receives and carefully files it 
according to her payment plan. The system helps remind her when to write checks to pay 
her company’s invoices, which she attempts to stretch out over a period of days or weeks to 
avoid having to make large cash disbursements at the same time. Proper scheduling of cash 
disbursement significantly improves the company’s cash flow.
3. Prioritize. Dunis cannot stretch out all of her company’s creditors for 45 days; some demand 
payment sooner. Those suppliers are at the top of the accounts-payable list.
4. Be consistent. Dunis says that companies value customers who pay their bills regularly and 
consistently. Most companies are willing to extend trade credit for 20 to 30 days as long as 
they know that the customer will pay the bill in full on time.51 ■
Other signs that a business is heading for cash flow problems include difficulty making pay-
ments on loans and incurring penalties for late payment of routine bills.

CHAPTER 12 • MANAGING CASH FLOW

Serial entrepreneur Alan Knitowski, founder of Phunware, a mo-
bile apps company that develops and hosts apps for clients such 
as the National Football League and NASCAR, learned the impor-
tance of cash flow when he launched his first company, VoViDa, 
a communications software provider, in the 1990s. Knitowski 
cofounded VoViDa with enough cash to fund six months’ worth 
of expenses, but the company began burning cash faster than
expected. Fortunately, the cofounders were able to attract equity 
financing quickly enough to keep the company afloat until Cisco 
Systems purchased it nearly two years later.
When Knitowski started Phunware, he treated cash as if it
were the company’s lifeline because his experience taught him 
that it was. Every Friday afternoon, the Phunware’s controller 
sends a color-coded dashboard that illustrates the company’s key 
financial metrics, including the amount of cash on hand, its cur-
rent ratio, upcoming receivables, and others. Managers dedicate 
time regularly to tracking the data, analyzing it, comparing it to
past data, and looking for trends. The color-coded dashboard is 
easy to understand. If Phunware has more than 18 months’ worth
of cash on hand, the dashboard shows a green light; if its cash 
balance is between 12 and 18 months’ of expenses, the light is
yellow; a cash balance less than 12 months of expenses results in a
flashing red light. If the red light shows up (so far, it has not), plans 
call for Phunware to tap its line of credit, an asset-based loan, or 
some other type of bridge financing.
Phunware has grown to 160 employees and annual sales of 
$22 million with an average accounts receivable balance of about 
$5.5 million at any given time. Knitowski and his management 
team monitor the company’s accounts receivable closely, trying to 
avoid uncollectible accounts. They constantly watch for customers 
whose accounts have become past-due, taking action to collect 
them immediately. Although Knitowski admits that his hard-nosed 
approach to collecting past due accounts has cost Phunware a 
few customers, he stands by the policy because he understands 
that the money those customers owe is Phunware’s, and it is his 
job to collect it. The company’s accounts receivable policy is firm, 
insisting on payment within 30 days of delivering an app to a 
customer. In addition, most clients pay 50 percent of the cost of
a job up front when the parties sign the contract. Phunware also 
has several clients that purchase semi-annual subscriptions, which 
smoothes out its cash flow and makes it more predictable.
Small businesses report that their customers, particularly 
large companies, are stretching their accounts payable longer, 
paying invoices more slowly now than they were just a few years 
ago. When faced with 30-day credit terms, it is not uncommon 
for large companies to delay their payments to 45 to 60 days, 
sometimes longer. The Small Business Network Monitor, a study 
of small businesses by American Express, confirms the challenge 
this presents for entrepreneurs. More than half of the small busi-
ness owners surveyed say their companies experience cash flow
problems, and one of their primary concerns is collecting accounts 
receivable. The average small business incurs $5,140 in past-due 
accounts receivables from its customers each month.
“If the money is coming in the front door at 100 miles per
hour,” explains Brian Hamilton, CEO of Sageworks, a financial
consulting firm, “and going out the back door at 110 miles per
hour, that’s not a good thing. Businesses don’t fail because they 
are unprofitable; they fail because they get crushed on the ac-
counts receivable side.” What steps can entrepreneurs take to
avoid a cash crisis caused by accounts receivable that turn slowly? 
The following steps can help:
•
Evaluate your company’s collection process. How many 
people are involved in generating an invoice? (Fewer is 
better.) Where do bottlenecks in the billing process occur? 
(Setting a time limit on processing paperwork helps.) What 
percentage of your company’s invoices are erroneous? (The 
higher the percentage of errors, the slower the company’s
collections will be.)
•
Increase your company’s cash reserves. Smart business 
owners keep at least three months’ worth of expenses on 
hand so that they aren’t caught cash short if receivables 
slow down more than expected or if sales suddenly decline.
•
Boost your company’s line of credit. Business owners 
can increase their lines of credit with their banks, but the 
key is to do so before you need the money. Be prepared to 
use your company’s financial statements to prove to your 
banker why you need—and deserve—an increased line of 
credit.
•
Monitor accounts receivable closely. Like Knitowski, 
some entrepreneurs generate weekly (or even daily) sum-
maries of their company’s accounts receivable, always on 
the lookout for disturbing trends. Doing so enables them to 
spot slow payers who might become nonpayers unless the 
company takes immediate action.
•
Get to know the people responsible for paying 
invoices at your biggest customers’ or clients’ 
companies. Collections are easier if you know the right 
person to call.
•
Take immediate action when an account becomes 
past due. Resist the tendency to simply sit back and wait 
for the customer to pay. If a customer has not paid by the 
invoice due date, contact him or her immediately and ask 
for payment.
•
Watch for signs that customers may be about to
declare bankruptcy. When a customer declares bankruptcy, 
the probability that a company can collect the cash it is owed 
is miniscule. Terri Oyarzun, founder of Goats R Us, a company

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Business owners should verify all invoices before paying them. Some unscrupulous ven-
dors send out invoices for goods they never shipped or services they never provided, knowing 
that many business owners will simply pay the bill without checking its authenticity. Two com-
mon scams aimed at small business owners involve bogus operators sending invoices for office 
supplies or ads in nonexistent printed or online “yellow pages” directories. In some cases, the
directories actually do exist, but their distribution is so limited that ads in them are useless. To
avoid falling victim to such scams, someone in the company—for instance, the accounts-payable 
clerk—should have the responsibility of verifying every invoice received.
A clever cash manager also negotiates the best possible credit terms with his or her suppli-
ers. Almost all vendors grant their customers trade credit, and small business owners should take 
advantage of it. Favorable credit terms can make a tremendous difference in a company’s cash 
flow. Table 12.7 shows the same most likely cash budget from Table 12.2 with one exception: 
instead of purchasing on C.O.D. terms as shown in Table 12.2, the owner has negotiated “net 
30” payment terms. Notice the drastic improvement in the company’s cash flow that results from 
improved credit terms.
If owners do find themselves financially strapped when payment to a vendor is due, they should 
avoid making empty promises that “the check is in the mail” or sending unsigned checks. Instead, 
they should discuss the situation honestly with the vendor. Most vendors will work out payment 
terms for extended credit. One small business owner who was experiencing a cash crisis claims,
One day things got so bad I just called up a supplier and said, “I need your stuff, but I’m 
going through a tough period and simply can’t pay you right now.” They said they wanted 
to keep me as a customer, and they asked if it was okay to bill me in three months. I was 
dumbfounded: They didn’t even charge me interest.52
Entrepreneurs also can improve their firms’ cash flow by scheduling controllable cash disburse-
ments so that they do not come due at the same time. For example, paying employees every two
weeks (or every month) rather than every week reduces administrative costs and gives the business 
more time to use its cash. Owners of fledgling businesses may be able to conserve cash by hiring
part-time employees or by using freelance workers rather than full-time, permanent workers. Sched-
uling insurance premiums monthly or quarterly rather than annually also can improve cash flows.
Inventory
Offering customers a wider variety of products is one way a business can outshine its competi-
tors, but product proliferation increases the need for tight inventory control to avoid a cash

that when one customer declared bankruptcy, she would 
never be able to collect the $53,000 the company owed her 
business. Oyarzun says she had to postpone purchasing a
new truck for the farm and hiring new goat herders.
•
Stick to your credit terms. Define the credit terms with 
every client up front. If clients balk when it comes time for 
payment, remind them that they have a commitment to live 
up to the terms of the sales contract.
•
Raise prices to cover the extra cost of late payments. 
If clients refuse to pay on time, determine how much their 
slower payments cost your company and raise your rates or 
your prices enough to cover the cost.
•
Require customers to pay at least part of total price of 
a contract up front. Because the jobs that one small film 
production company performs require the owner to incur
some rather sizable expenses before they are completed, he 
implemented a policy that requires customers to pay one-
third of the cost up front, another one-third at mid-project, 
and the balance on completion.
•
Offer discounts to encourage early payment. Cash 
discounts (such as “2/10, net 30,” which means that you 
offer the client a 2 percent discount if he or she pays within
10 days; otherwise, the full invoice amount is due in 
30 days) can reduce a small company’s profit margin, but they 
also provide an incentive for clients to pay early. Remember: 
More companies fail for lack of cash than for lack of profit.

crisis. The typical grocery store now stocks about 42,700 items, three times as many as it did 
20 years ago, and many other types of businesses are following this pattern.53 Although inven-
tory is the largest investment for many businesses, entrepreneurs often manage it haphazardly,
creating a severe strain on their companies’ cash flow. As a result, the typical small business 
has not only too much inventory but also too much of the wrong kind of inventory! Because 
inventory is illiquid, it can quickly siphon off a company’s pool of available cash. “Small
companies need cash to grow,” says one consultant. “They’ve got to be able to turn [cash] over 
quickly. That’s difficult to do if a lot of money is tied up in excess inventory.”54 After being 

486
SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
caught in a cash crisis due to excess inventory early in her entrepreneurial career, Laura Zander,
founder of the yarn shop Jimmy Beans Wool, learned from her mistake. Now she ensures that 
her inventory grows no faster than her business. “We would rather have extra cash than extra 
inventory,” she says.55
Surplus inventory yields a zero rate of return and unnecessarily 
ties up a company’s cash. “Carrying inventory is expensive,” says one
small business consultant. “A typical manufacturing company pays
25 percent to 30 percent of the value of the inventory for the cost of bor-r
rowed money, warehouse space, materials handling, staff, lift-truck ex-
penses, and fixed costs. This shocks a lot of people. Once they realize it, 
they look at inventory differently.”56 Marking down items that don’t sell 
keeps inventory lean and allows it to turn over frequently. Even though 
volume discounts lower inventory costs, large purchases may tie up the 
company’s valuable cash. Wise business owners avoid overbuying in-
ventory, recognizing that excess inventory ties up valuable cash unpro-
ductively. In fact, only 20 percent of a typical business’s inventory turns 
over quickly; therefore, owners must watch constantly for stale items.57
If a small business must pay its suppliers within 30 days of receiving 
an inventory shipment and the merchandise sits on the shelf for another 
30 to 60 days (or more), the pressure on its cash flow intensifies. In-
creasing a company’s inventory turnover ratio frees surprising amounts of cash. For instance, if 
a company with $2 million in annual sales that turns its inventory twice each year improves its 
inventory turnover ratio by just two weeks, it will improve its cash flow by nearly $18,900.
Carrying too little inventory is not the ideal solution to cash flow challenges because com-
panies with excessive “stock-outs” lose sales (and eventually customers if the problem persists). 
However, carrying too much inventory usually results in slow-moving inventory and a low 
inventory turnover ratio. Experienced business owners understand the importance of shedding 
slow-moving inventory during end-of-season sales, even if they must resort to markdowns.
Carrying too much inventory increases the chances that a business will run out of cash.
An entrepreneur’s goal is to minimize the company’s investment in inventory without sacrific-
ing sales, selection, and customer satisfaction. Inventory should grow no faster than a compa-
ny’s sales. “The cash that pays for goods is channeled into inventory,” says one business writer,
“where its flow is dead-ended until the inventory is sold and the cash is set free again. The cash
flow trick is to commit just enough cash to inventory to meet demand.”58 Scheduling inventory 
deliveries at the latest possible date prevents premature payment of invoices. In addition, given 
goods of comparable quality and price, an entrepreneur should purchase goods from the fastest 
supplier to keep inventory levels as low as possible. All of these tactics require entrepreneurs to 
manage their supply chains carefully and to treat their suppliers as partners in their businesses.
Keeping inventory churning rapidly through a small business requires creating a nimble, adaptive
supply chain that responds to a company’s changing needs.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Zara Zara, a chain of retail stores that sells inexpensive, 
stylish clothing to young, fashion-conscious people, manages its supply chain so efficiently
that its inventory turnover ratio is much higher than the industry average. As a result, the com-
pany ties up less cash in inventory than its competition. Zara’s fast-fashion approach also keeps 
customers coming back by keeping stores’ inventory fresh, adding new items constantly at a rate
that leaves most of its competitors in awe. In fact, Zara can take a garment from design to store 
shelf in just two to three weeks instead of the five to twelve months that most clothing retailers 
require. The company tracks the latest fashion trends and manufactures small runs of items, which 
allows it to avoid being stuck with large quantities of unpopular garments it must mark down. 
Zara manufactures larger quantities of only those items that sell quickly. The result is that Zara’s 
nearly 1,900 stores, which are located in 86 countries, sell 85 percent of their inventory at full
price, compared to the industry average of 60 to 70 percent. Zara has created an irresistible image 
of scarcity that appeals to its faithful customers who shop at Zara an average of 17 times per year 
(compared to 4 to 6 times a year for other clothing retailers) and who know that when they find 
something they like, they had better buy it, or it may be gone—for good. The result is a minimal
investment in inventory that ties up little cash but yields above-average sales and profits.59 ■

Business owners also should take advantage of quantity discounts and cash discounts their 
suppliers offer. Quantity discounts give businesses a price break when they order large quantities 
of merchandise and supplies and exist in two forms: noncumulative and cumulative. A company 
earns a noncumulative quantity discount only if it purchases a certain volume of merchandise in a 
single order. For example, a wholesaler may offer small retailers a 3 percent discount only if they 
purchase 10 gross of Halloween masks in a single order. Cumulative quantity discounts apply if 
a company’s purchases from a particular vendor exceed a specified quantity or dollar value over 
a predetermined time period. The time frame varies, but a year is most common. For example, a 
manufacturer of appliances may offer a small business a 3 percent discount on subsequent orders
if its purchases exceed $10,000 per year.
Cash discounts are offered to customers as an incentive to pay for merchandise promptly. 
Many vendors grant cash discounts to avoid being used as an interest-free bank by customers
who purchase merchandise and then fail to pay by the invoice due date. To encourage prompt 
payment of invoices, many vendors allow customers to deduct a percentage of the purchase 
amount if they pay within a specified time. Cash discount terms “2/10, net 30” are common in
many industries. These terms mean that the total amount of the invoice is due 30 days, but if the 
bill is paid within 10 days, the buyer may deduct 2 percent from the total. A discount offering 
“2/10, EOM” (EOM means “end of month”) indicates that the buyer may deduct 2 percent if the 
bill is paid by the tenth of the month after purchase.
In general, it is sound business practice to take advantage of cash discounts because a com-
pany incurs an implicit (opportunity) cost by forgoing a cash discount. By failing to take advan-
tage of the cash discount, an entrepreneur is, in effect, paying an annual interest rate to retain the 
use of the discounted amount for the remainder of the credit period. For example, suppose the
Print Shop receives an invoice for $1,000 from a vendor offering a cash discount of 2/10, net 30.
Figure 12.8 illustrates this situation and shows how to compute the cost of forgoing the cash dis-
count. Notice that the cost of forgoing this cash discount is 37.25 percent. Table 12.8 summarizes 
the cost of forgoing cash discounts with different terms.
Monitoring the big three of cash management helps every business owner to avoid a cash
crisis while making the best use of available cash. According to one expert, maximizing cash 
flow involves “getting money from customers sooner; paying bills at the last moment possible; 
consolidating money in a single bank account; managing accounts payable, accounts receivable,
and inventory more effectively; and squeezing every penny out of your daily business.”60
Avoiding the Cash Crunch
Nearly every small business has the potential to improve its cash position with little or no invest-
ment. The key is to make an objective evaluation of the company’s financial policies, searching 
for inefficiency in its cash flow. Young firms cannot afford to waste resources, especially one as

vital as cash. By using the following techniques, entrepreneurs can get maximum benefit from 
their companies’ pool of available cash.
Barter
Bartering, the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services rather than for cash, 
is an effective way to conserve cash. An ancient concept, bartering has regained popularity in 
recent years. Bootstrapping entrepreneurs often use bartering to finance the start-up costs of their 
businesses, and many exchange equity in their companies for essential services such as legal, ac-
counting, and Web design. To launch BucketFeet, their online retail store selling limited edition 
sneakers, Raaj Nemani and Aaron Firestein gave up a small percentage of the ownership of their 
business in exchange for $100,000 worth of high-end Web site design to Dashfire LLC. Nemani 
points out that by bartering, they were able to conserve precious cash in one of the most critical 
periods of a company’s life.61 Entrepreneurs also turn to Web sites such as Craigslist to find busi-
nesses with which they can barter.
Today, more than 500 barter exchanges operate across the United States (visit the National 
Association of Trade Exchanges at www.natebarter.com to locate them), and they cater primarily
to small- and medium-size businesses looking to conserve cash. Some 400,000 companies—
most of them small—engage in more than $12 billion worth of barter each year.62 Every day, 
entrepreneurs across the nation use bartering to buy much-needed materials, services, equipment, 
and supplies—without using precious cash.
t
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Judah Schiff: Jmac Supply Jmac Supply, a security 
equipment supplier founded by Judah Schiff in 2009 in Valley Stream, New York, routinely
barters for many professional services, a habit the company developed during the start-up phase. 
Miki Segal, the company’s chief marketing officer, says bartering kept the company alive in its 
early days. Bartering continues to help the company conserve cash.63 ■
In addition to conserving cash, companies that use barter also have the opportunity to trans-
form slow-moving inventory into much-needed products and services. Buying goods and ser-
vices with barter also offers the benefit of a built-in discount. Although a company gets credit for 
the retail value of the goods or services it offers, the real cost to the company is less and depends 
on its gross profit margin. For instance, the owner of an Italian restaurant bartered $1,000 worth 
of meals for some new furniture, but his actual cost of the meals was only $680, given his gross 
profit margin of 32 percent. Entrepreneurs who join barter exchanges often find new customers 
for their products and services, an important benefit for start-ups. When Logan Hale opened
his video production company, V3 Media Marketing, in Fort Collins, Colorado, he immediately 
began bartering his services for legal, accounting, and other professional services—even a gym 
membership. Hale says bartering enabled him to land business clients that he would not have
been able to attract otherwise, which accelerated the growth of his young business.64
In a typical barter exchange, businesses accumulate trade credits (think barter dollars) when 
they offer goods or services through the exchange. Then they use their trade credits to purchase 
other goods and services from other members of the exchange. The typical exchange charges a 
$400 to $800 membership fee, a $10 to $15 monthly maintenance fee, and an 8 to 10 percent 
transaction fee (half from the buyer and half from the seller) on every deal. The exchange acts as
a barter “bank,” tracking the balance in each member’s account and typically sending monthly 
statements summarizing account activity. Before joining a barter exchange, entrepreneurs 
should investigate its fee structure, the selection and the prices of its goods and services, and its
bartering
the exchange of goods and 
services for other goods 
and services rather than 
for cash.

geographic coverage to make sure the fit is a good one. In addition, barter exchanges report their 
members’ barter transactions because they are subject to taxes.
Trim Overhead Costs
High overhead expenses can strain a small company’s cash supply to the breaking point, and
simple cost-cutting measures can save big money. Operating a business efficiently improves its
cash flow. Larry Parsons, owner of Sackville Cab, a cab company in Sackville, New Brunswick, 
realized that fuel and maintenance expenses for his fleet of large vehicles were eating into his 
company’s profits. Over time, he replaced his fleet with more fuel-efficient and reliable models
that provided room for up to six people and their luggage. Parsons also reduced the number of 
full-time drivers he employed and replaced them with part-time drivers, which allows him to 
cover peak demand periods more easily. With the changes, Sackville Cab’s costs of operation 
declined significantly, and the company is thriving once again.65
Frugal small business owners can trim their overhead in a number of ways.
ASK FOR DISCOUNTS AND “FREEBIES” Entrepreneurs can conserve cash by negotiating discounts
on the purchases they make and using free services whenever possible. For instance, rather 
than pay a high-priced consultant to assist him with his business plan, one entrepreneur opted
instead to use the free services of his local SBDC. The move not only improved the quality of 
his business plan, enabling him to get the financing he needed to launch his business, but also 
conserved valuable cash for the start-up.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Sid Jaridly: Original Mr. Cabinet Care Sid Jaridly, CEO
of the Original Mr. Cabinet Care, a kitchen remodeling business in Anaheim, California, saw 
his company’s profit margins being squeezed from an industry downturn and approached his top 
50 vendors and asked for price reductions of 10 to 15 percent. Nearly 30 of his suppliers agreed to his 
request for price concessions, a move that saved his company nearly $500,000 in just one year!66 ■
CONDUCT PERIODIC EXPENSE AUDITS Business owners should evaluate their operating costs 
periodically to make sure they have not gotten out of line. Comparing current expenses with past 
levels is helpful, and so is comparing a company’s expenses against industry standards. Useful 
resources for determining typical expenses in an industry include the RMA’s Annual Statement 
Studies, Dun & Bradstreet’s Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios, Bizminer, and Prentice 
Hall’s Almanac of Business and Industrial Financial Ratios.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Sam Goodner: Catapult Systems At least twice a year,
Sam Goodner, founder of Catapult Systems, an IT consulting firm in Austin, Texas, reviews
every invoice his company pays with a member of his accounting staff, looking for ways to reduce 
the company’s expenses. Recently, Goodner replaced a monthly $600 bottled water service with a 
water filtration system that cost just $600 annually. He also saved $40,000 a year by switching his 
public relations firm from a retainer to project-based assignments. “There are tens of thousands 
of dollars a year I can cut, and the company doesn’t feel the difference,” says Goodner.67 ■
WHEN PRACTICAL, LEASE INSTEAD OF BUY Businesses spend about $800 billion on equipment 
annually, and companies acquire about one-third of that equipment through leases.68 By leasing
automobiles, computers, office equipment, machinery, and many other types of assets rather 
than buying them, entrepreneurs can conserve valuable cash. The value of these assets is not in 
owning them but in using them. Leasing is a popular cash management strategy; about 85 percent 
of companies lease some or all of their equipment.69 “These companies are long on ideas, short 
on capital, and in need of flexibility as they grow and change,” says Suzanne Jackson of the
Equipment Leasing Association of America. “They lease for efficiency and convenience.”70
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Mark Kolodziej: Hudson Bread In 1994, Mark Kolodziej 
opened a bakery, Hudson Bread, in New York City and soon was supplying baguettes, 
focaccias, and other artisanal breads to some of the city’s finest restaurants. Hudson Bread grew, 
and in 2003, Kolodziej opened a 50,000-square-foot baking facility in North Bergen, New Jersey.
Bakery equipment is quite expensive, and to conserve capital, Kolodziej decided to lease rather 
than buy the equipment his company needed. He used the same strategy in 2008 when Hudson 
Bread turned to GE Capital to lease the $1.5 million equipment to open a second baking facility 
outside of Philadelphia.71 ■

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
Although total lease payments typically are greater than those for a conventional loan, 
most leases offer 100 percent financing, meaning that the owner avoids the large capital out-
lays required as down payments on most loans. (Sometimes a lease requires the first and last 
months’ payments to be made up front.) Leasing also protects a business against obsolescence, 
especially when it comes to equipment such as computer hardware and software, whose tech-
nological life is limited to perhaps just two or three years. Furthermore, leasing is an “off-the-
balance-sheet” method of financing and requires no collateral. The equipment a company leases 
does not have to be depreciated because the small business does not actually own it. A lease is 
considered an operating expense on the income statement, not a liability on the balance sheet.
Thus, leasing conserves a company’s borrowing capacity. Because lease payments are fixed
amounts paid over a particular time period, leasing allows business owners to forecast more ac-
curately their cash flows. Lease agreements also are flexible; entrepreneurs can customize their 
lease payments to coincide with the seasonal fluctuations in their companies’ cash balances. 
Leasing companies typically allow businesses to stretch payments over a longer time period
than do conventional loans.
Entrepreneurs can choose from two basic types of leases: operating leases and capital leases.
At the end of an operating lease, a business turns the equipment back over to the leasing com-
pany with no further obligation. Businesses often lease computer and telecommunications equip-
ment through operating leases because it becomes obsolete so quickly. At the end of a capital 
lease, a business may exercise an option to purchase the equipment, usually for a nominal sum.
AVOID NONESSENTIAL OUTLAYS By forgoing costly ego indulgences like ostentatious office 
equipment, first-class travel, and flashy company cars, entrepreneurs can make the most efficient 
use of a company’s cash and put their money where it really counts. Before putting scarce cash
into an asset, every business owner should put the decision to the acid test: “Will this purchase
improve my company’s profits and cash flow or enhance its ability to compete?” The secret to 
successful cost saving is cutting nonessential expenditures. Making across-the-board spending 
l
cuts to conserve cash is dangerous because the owner runs the risk of cutting expenditures that 
drive the business. One common mistake during business slowdowns is cutting marketing and 
advertising expenditures. Economic slowdowns present a prime opportunity for smart business 
owners to bring increased attention to their products and services and to gain market share if 
they hold the line on their marketing and advertising budgets as their competitors cut back.
“If the lifeblood of your company is marketing, cut it less,” advises one advertising executive.
“If it is customer service, that is the last thing you want to cut back on. Cut from areas that are
not essential to business growth.”72
BUY USED OR RECONDITIONED EQUIPMENT, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS “BEHIND-THE-SCENES” MACHINERY 
One restaurateur saved thousands of dollars in the start-up phase of his business by buying used
equipment from a restaurant equipment broker.
HIRE PART-TIME EMPLOYEES AND FREELANCE SPECIALISTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE Hiring part-
time workers and freelancers rather than full-time employees saves on the cost of salaries,
vacations, and benefits.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Gina Kleinworth: HireBetter Gina Kleinworth, CEO of 
HireBetter, a business based in Austin, Texas, that helps small and midsize companies find
the talent they need, relies on an entirely part-time workforce of 35 employees. Kleinworth keeps 
her company’s payroll costs under control, and her workers appreciate the flexibility in their 
schedules. “Employees have time to get their work done, and go to the gym, take their kids to the 
park, or volunteer in their communities,” she says.73 ■
OUTSOURCE One technique that many entrepreneurs use to conserve valuable cash is to outsource 
certain activities to businesses that specialize in performing them rather than hiring someone to 
do them in-house (or doing the activities themselves). In addition to saving cash, outsourcing
enables entrepreneurs to focus on the most important aspects of running their businesses. “Stick 
to what you are good at and outsource everything else,” advises one entrepreneur.74 Outsourcing 
is one principle of building a lean start-up.

CHAPTER 12 • MANAGING CASH FLOW

USE E-MAIL RATHER THAN MAIL Whenever appropriate, entrepreneurs should use e-mail rather 
than mail to correspond with customers, suppliers, and others to reduce postage costs.
USE CREDIT CARDS TO MAKE SMALL PURCHASES Using a credit card to make small purchases 
from vendors who do not offer credit terms allows entrepreneurs to defer payment for up to 
30 days. In addition, some credit cards include “cash back” offers that can save entrepreneurs
thousands of dollars a year and simplify the accounts payable process by providing a single 
bill. Entrepreneurs who use this strategy must be disciplined, however, and pay off the entire
credit card balance each month. Carrying a credit card balance from month to month exposes an 
entrepreneur to annual interest rates of 12 to 25 percent—not a cash-conserving technique!
t
NEGOTIATE FIXED LOAN PAYMENTS TO COINCIDE WITH YOUR COMPANY’S CASH FLOW CYCLE 
Many lenders allow businesses to structure loans so that they can skip specific payments when 
their cash flow ebbs to its lowest point. Negotiating such terms gives businesses the opportunity
to customize their loan repayments to their cash flow cycles.
ESTABLISH AN INTERNAL SECURITY AND CONTROL SYSTEM Too many owners encourage em-
ployee theft by failing to establish a system of controls. Reconciling the bank statement monthly 
and requiring approval for checks over a specific amount—say, $1,000—helps to minimize 
losses. Separating record-keeping and check-writing responsibilities, rather than assigning them 
to a single employee, offers additional protection against fraud.
DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO BATTLE CHECK FRAUD Although the use of checks in the United 
States continues to decline, customers still write more than 18 billion checks per year that total 
$26 trillion. Unfortunately, about 64 million of those are bad checks that cost businesses nearly
$78 billion per year.75 Bad checks and check fraud can wreak havoc on a small company’s 
cash flow. Simple techniques for minimizing losses from bad checks include requesting proper 
identification (preferably with a photograph) from customers, recording customers’ telephone 
numbers, and training cashiers to watch for forged or counterfeit checks. Perhaps the most 
effective way to battle bad and fraudulent checks is to subscribe to an electronic check processing
service. The service works at the cash register, and approval takes only seconds. The fee a small 
business pays to use the service depends on the volume of checks. For most small companies, 
charges amount to 1 to 2 percent of the cleared checks’ value.
CHANGE YOUR SHIPPING TERMS Changing a company’s shipping terms from “F.O.B. (free on 
board) buyer,” in which the seller pays the cost of freight, to “F.O.B. seller,” in which the
r
buyer
absorbs all shipping costs, improves its cash flow.
START SELLING GIFT CARDS Gift cards are a huge business, generating annual sales of 
$118 billion, and can provide a real boost to a small company’s cash flow.76 Customers pay for 
the cards up front, but the typical recipient does not redeem the gift card until later, sometimes 
much later, giving the company the use of the cash during that time. Selling gift cards also 
increases a company’s revenue because studies show that 60 percent of card recipients spend 
more than the value of the gift card (and 45 percent of gift card recipients spend at least 
60 percent more than the value of the card).77 Gift cards are an effective way to increase a small 
company’s customer base; 41 percent of customers say they shopped at a business for the first 
time because they received a gift card for that business, and 72 percent of them returned to that 
business to make repeat purchases.78 E-gift cards, digital gift cards that recipients receive via 
e-mail and can redeem with their smart phones or other mobile devices, represent one of the 
fastest-growing sectors in the gift card market.
Unfortunately, only 10 percent of small and midsize merchants sell gift cards.79
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Colleen Stone: Inspa Corporation Colleen Stone, 
owner of Inspa Corporation, a fast-growing chain of day spas based in Seattle, Washington, 
uses gift cards to stretch her company’s cash flow. Gift cards account for 25 percent of her com-
pany’s sales, and Stone has discovered that many of the gift cards she sells are not redeemed for
a year, giving her a source of interest-free cash in the interim. “We plow all that cash flow right 
back into opening new stores,” says Stone.80 ■

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
SWITCH TO ZERO-BASED BUDGETING Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) primarily is a shift in the 
philosophy of budgeting. Rather than build the current-year budget on increases from the previous 
year’s budget, ZBB starts from a budget of zero and evaluates the necessity of every item. The 
idea is to start each year’s budget with a zero balance and then review each expense category to 
determine whether it is necessary.
BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SHOPLIFTING AND EMPLOYEE THEFT Companies lose an estimated
$63 billion each year to shoplifting and employee theft.81 Although any business can be a victim 
of shoplifting or employee theft, retailers are particularly vulnerable. Shoplifting is the most 
common business crime, costing retailers an estimated $13 billion each year. Shoplifting takes an
especially heavy toll on small businesses because they usually have the weakest lines of defense 
against shoplifters. If a shoplifter steals just one item that sells for $100 from a small business
with an 8 percent net profit margin, the company must sell an additional $1,250 worth of goods 
to make up for the loss.
Even though shoplifting is more common than employee theft, businesses lose more money 
each year to employee theft. Dishonest employees steal 5.5 times more from the businesses for 
which they work than shoplifters.82 The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that 
companies worldwide lose 5 percent of their annual revenue to fraud by employees.83 The most 
common item stolen is, not surprisingly, cash. Because small business owners often rely on in-
formal procedures for managing cash (or have no procedures at all) and often lack proper control 
procedures, they are most likely to become victims of employee theft, embezzlement, and fraud
by their employees. Although 64 percent of small businesses report having experienced employee 
theft, only 16 percent of business owners reported the theft to police.84 The median loss suf-f
fered by small companies in the United States is a disproportionately large $147,000.85 The most 
common methods employees use to steal from small businesses are fraudulent billing schemes, 
corruption, and check tampering. Alarmingly, the typical fraud goes on for 18 months before the 
owner discovers it, most often after another employee tips off the owner to the theft.86 Although 
establishing a totalitarian police state and trusting no one is not conducive to a positive work 
environment, putting in place adequate financial control systems is essential. Separating among 
at least two employees key cash management duties, such as writing checks and handling bank 
statements and conducting regular financial audits, can be effective deterrents to employee theft.
BUILD A CASH CUSHION Entrepreneurs who have experienced a cash crisis keenly understand
the need for every business to build a working capital account as an emergency fund. How much 
should an entrepreneur put aside? Opinions differ, but most experts say that a small business
should put aside enough cash to cover three to six months’ worth of expenses—more if conditions 
warrant.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Carrie Davenport: Century Personnel Carrie Davenport, 
owner of Century Personnel, a company that specializes in filling jobs in manufacturing, 
engineering, accounting, and health care, did everything she could to reduce expenses when sales
plummeted during a recent recession. She also began putting aside more money into Century 
Personnel’s working capital account, which now has $300,000 more than usual in it in case the
economy takes another downturn so that she will have enough cash to keep her business going. 
Even after reducing her staff from 36 to 14 at the height of the recession, Davenport was con-
cerned that she had only enough cash tucked aside to cover the company’s expenses for a couple 
of months. That prompted her to build a larger cash cushion for her company’s protection by add-
ing consistently to Century Personnel’s “rainy-day fund.”87 ■
INVEST SURPLUS CASH Because of the uneven flow of receipts and disbursements, a company 
will often temporarily have more cash than it needs—for a week, month, quarter, or even longer.
When this happens, most small business owners simply ignore the surplus because they are not 
sure how soon they will need it. They believe that relatively small amounts of cash sitting around 
for just a few days or weeks are not worth investing. However, this is not the case. Small business
owners who put surplus cash to work immediately rather than allowing it to sit idle soon discover 
that the yield adds up to a significant amount over time. This money can help ease the daily cash 
crunch during business troughs. Business owners’ goal should be to invest every dollar that they
are not using to pay their current bills so that they can improve their cash flow.

CHAPTER 12 • MANAGING CASH FLOW
493
Looking back, Kelly Morris and her business partner admit they
were naïve about employee theft when they opened their first
pizza restaurant, believing that if they treated their workers well 
and paid them fairly, the employees would not steal from them. 
Experience, however, soon taught them that some people would
steal no matter what the young entrepreneurs did. Some employ-
ees stole money, some stole inventory and equipment, and others
stole food. Initially, Morris and her partner scheduled an employee 
to go in to set up for the day an hour before anyone else arrived.
Unfortunately, that employee, alone in the restaurant, used the 
opportunity to steal items from the restaurant’s inventory. When 
the entrepreneurs began having a second employee come in to set 
up, the thefts stopped. Later, an employee alerted Morris and her 
partner to another theft scheme: an employee was going into the 
restaurant in the middle of the night, making a few pizzas, and 
taking them home to eat. They solved that problem by installing 
an alarm system that required a unique identification code to turn
it off. When Morris caught an employee stealing a bottle of soda, 
she fired him. She admits it was a minor incident, but she recog-
nized the importance of a zero-tolerance policy and the signal it
sends to other employees when it comes to stealing. After attend-
ing a workshop sponsored by the local police department, Morris
and her partner began using clear trash bags to make stealing 
food items by hiding them in the trash more difficult. Fortunately, 
Morris and her partner were able to gain control over their em-
ployee theft problem before it caused their business to collapse, 
but some entrepreneurs have to close their businesses because 
employee theft and fraud destroy their cash flow.
Because small businesses often lack the financial and control 
procedures that large companies impose, they are disproportion-
ately more likely to be victims of employee theft. Small companies 
are common targets of employee theft because employees, espe-
cially long-term employees, know the weaknesses in the company’s 
systems, procedures, and controls and take advantage when the 
right opportunity presents itself. Indeed, the longer the tenure of an
employee who steals, the greater is the amount stolen. According to
a recent study by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, the
median theft by perpetrators who had been with a company more
than 10 years was $229,000; the median theft for those who stolen 
from a company in their first year of employment was $25,000. One
expert cites the following “formula” for employee theft:
Pressure + Rationalization + Opportunity = Employee theft
The only factor in the equation that employers can control is 
opportunity, which is why entrepreneurs’ money is better spent 
preventing employee theft rather than detecting it.
Although 64 percent of small businesses report being vic-
tims of employee theft, only 16 percent reported the theft to the 
police. Business owners cite four reasons for failing to report theft 
by employees: (1) they do not perceive the theft as one warranting 
any more attention than firing the employee, (2) their attorneys of-
ten advise them that the cost in time and energy to prosecute the 
thief would likely outweigh any benefits, (3) the decision to pros-
ecute is charged with emotion because the employee has worked 
alongside the owner for many years or is a family member, and
(4) they see the police and criminal justice system as ineffective. 
The median amount stolen among small companies is $147,000, 
an amount significant enough to threaten the existence of the 
businesses themselves. In many cases, the theft leaves the busi-
ness in a cash bind from which it is unable to recover. In fact,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that one-third of all
small business bankruptcies are the result of employee theft. In 
small businesses, the typical fraud goes on for 18 months before 
the owner discovers it. More than 43 percent of the time, an 
employee tips off the owner to the theft, nearly three times the 
percentage of thefts that are discovered by management review 
(14.6 percent). Seven percent of thefts are discovered by accident.
Many entrepreneurs are shocked to discover that the people 
who are stealing from their businesses are their most trusted, 
highly valued employees, the last people they would suspect. In 
t
the United States, employees (43.0 percent) are more likely to 
steal than are managers (34.3 percent), but thefts by manag-
ers cause three times more damage ($182,000) than those by 
employees ($60,000). Managers’ thefts also are more difficult to
detect, requiring a median of 24 months to detect, compared to 
12 months for those that employees commit. In the United States, 
55 percent of the perpetrators are male, 54 percent are between 
the ages of 31 and 45, and 54 percent have a college or postgrad-
uate degree. The most common “red flags” that lead to detection
are employees who are living beyond their means, those who are 
having financial difficulties, those who are unwilling to share their 
job duties (for fear of detection), and those who have an unusually 
close association with a company vendor.
The most effective way to deal with employee theft is to pre-
vent it. Entrepreneurs can take the following steps to reduce the
threat of employee theft:
•
Screen potential employees thoroughly. Statistics show 
that on average one out of every 40 employees is caught 
committing employee theft. A business owner’s most useful 
tool against theft is a thorough pre-employment screening 
process. The best time to weed out prospective criminals is 
before hiring them.
•
Monitor inventory closely. Business owners who fail to 
keep up-to-date, accurate inventory records are inviting em-
ployee theft. When the co-owners of two ice cream stores 
realized that their employees were stealing, they began to 
take inventory of their stock twice each day. Once employ-
ees knew that controls were in place, the thefts stopped, 
and profits went up.

SECTION III • LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS
However, when investing surplus cash, an entrepreneur’s primary objective should not be to 
t
earn the highest yield (which usually carries with it high levels of risk); instead, the focus should 
be on the safety and the liquidity of the investments. Making high-risk investments with a com-
pany’s cash cushion makes no sense and could jeopardize its future. The need to minimize risk 
and to have ready access to the cash restricts an entrepreneur’s investment options to just a few
such as money market accounts, zero-balance accounts, and sweep accounts. A money market 
account is an interest-bearing account offered by a variety of financial institutions ranging from 
banks to mutual funds. Money market accounts pay interest while allowing depositors to write 
checks (most have minimum check amounts) without tying their money up for a specific period 
of time.
A zero-balance account (ZBA) is a checking account that technically never has any funds
in it but is tied to a master account. The company keeps its money in the master account, where 
it earns interest, but it writes checks on the ZBA. At the end of the day, the bank pays all of the 
checks drawn on the ZBA; then it withdraws enough money from the master account to cover 
them. ZBAs allow a company to keep more cash working during the float period, the time be-
tween a check being issued and its being cashed. A sweep account automatically “sweeps” all 
funds in a company’s checking account above a predetermined minimum into an interest-bearing 
account, enabling it to keep otherwise idle cash invested until it is needed to cover checks.
KEEP YOUR BUSINESS PLAN CURRENT Before approaching any potential lender or investor, a 
business owner must prepare a solid business plan. Smart owners keep their plans up to date
in case an unexpected cash crisis forces them to seek emergency financing. Revising the plan 
annually also forces the owner to focus on managing the business more effectively.
Conclusion
Successful owners run their businesses “lean and mean.” Trimming wasteful expenditures, invest-
ing surplus funds, and carefully planning and managing the company’s cash flow enable them 
to compete effectively. The simple but effective techniques covered in this chapter can improve

•
Use technology to discourage theft. A variety of technol-
ogy tools help business owners minimize losses to employee 
theft and fraud at very reasonable prices. Simple video cam-
era systems, such as the ones used on the Food Network’s 
show Restaurant Stakeout, are responsible for nabbing 
many employee thieves, especially cameras that are focused 
on checkout stations and cash registers.
•
Set up a hotline. One of the most effective tools for mini-
mizing employee theft is to encourage employees to report 
suspicious activity and give them a mechanism for reporting. 
Remember that the most common way that managers 
detect employee theft is by a tip from another employee.
•
Embrace a zero-tolerance policy. When business owners 
catch an employee thief, the best course of action is to fire
the perpetrator and to prosecute. Most owners take the 
attitude: “Resign, return the money, and we’ll forget it.” 
Letting thieves off, however, only encourages them to move 
on to other businesses where they will steal again.

every small company’s cash position. One business writer says, “In the day-to-day course of run-
ning a company, other people’s capital flows past an imaginative CEO as opportunity. By looking 
forward and keeping an analytical eye on your cash account as events unfold (remembering that 
if there’s no real cash there when you need it, you’re history), you can generate leverage as surely
as if that capital were yours to keep.”88
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Explain the importance of cash management 
to a small company’s success.
● Cash is the most important but least productive asset 
the small business has. An entrepreneur must maintain
enough cash to meet the company’s normal require-
ments (plus a reserve for emergencies) without retain-
ing excessively large, unproductive cash balances.
● Without adequate cash, a small business will fail.
2. Differentiate between cash and profits.
● Cash and profits are not the same. More businesses
t
fail for lack of cash than for lack of profits.
● Profits, the difference between total revenue and total 
expenses, are an accounting concept. Cash flow repre-
sents the flow of actual cash (the only thing businesses
can use to pay bills) through a business in a continu-
ous cycle. A business can be earning a profit and be 
forced out of business because it runs out of cash.
3. Understand the five steps in creating a cash 
budget.
● The cash budgeting procedure outlined in this chap-
ter tracks the flow of cash through the business and 
enables the owner to project cash surpluses and cash 
deficits at specific intervals.
● The five steps in creating a cash budget are as
follows: determining a minimum cash balance, fore-
casting sales, forecasting cash receipts, forecasting 
cash disbursements, and determining the end-of-
month cash balance.
4. Describe fundamental principles involved 
in managing the “big three” of cash 
management: accounts receivable, accounts 
payable, and inventory.
● Controlling accounts receivable requires business
owners to establish clear, firm credit and collection 
policies and to screen customers before granting 
them credit. Sending invoices promptly and acting
on past-due accounts quickly also improve cash 
flow. The goal is to collect cash from receivables as 
quickly as possible.
● When managing accounts payable, a manager’s 
goal is to stretch out payables as long as pos-
sible without damaging the company’s credit rat-
ing. Other techniques include verifying invoices 
before paying them, taking advantage of cash 
discounts, and negotiating the best possible credit 
terms.
● Inventory frequently causes cash headaches for 
small business managers. Excess inventory earns 
a zero rate of return and ties up a company’s
cash unnecessarily. Owners must watch for stale 
merchandise.
5. Explain the techniques for avoiding a cash 
crunch in a small company.
● Key strategies include: trimming overhead costs 
by bartering; leasing assets rather than buying 
them; avoiding nonessential outlays; buying used
equipment; hiring part-time employees; negotiat-
ing fixed payments to coincide with a company’s 
cash flow cycle; implementing an internal control 
system boost a firm’s cash flow position; devel-
oping a system to battle check fraud; selling gift 
cards; using zero-based budgeting; being on the 
lookout for shoplifting and employee theft; build-
ing a cash cushion; and keeping the business plan
current.
● In addition, investing surplus cash maximizes
the firm’s earning power. The primary crite-
ria for investing surplus cash are security and 
liquidity.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Capital is a crucial element in the process of creating new ventures; yet raising the money to 
launch a new business venture has always been a challenge for entrepreneurs. Capital markets
rise and fall with the stock market, overall economic conditions, and investors’ fortunes. These 
swells and troughs in the availability of capital make the search for financing look like a wild 
roller-coaster ride. Entrepreneurs, especially those in less glamorous industries or those just start-
ing out, face difficulty finding outside sources of financing. Many banks shy away from making 
loans to start-ups, venture capitalists are looking for ever-larger deals, private investors have 
grown cautious, and making a public stock offering remains a viable option for only a handful 
of promising companies with good track records and fast-growth futures. The result has been a 
credit crunch for entrepreneurs looking for small to moderate amounts of start-up capital. Entre-
preneurs and business owners who need between $100,000 and $3 million are especially hard hit 
because of the vacuum that exists at that level of financing.
In the face of this capital crunch, business’s need for capital has never been greater. In a recent 
survey by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), 41 percent of small business 
owners say lack of capital is an impediment to the growth of their companies.1 However, many 
small business owners have adapted to the new credit conditions. In another survey by the NFIB, 
48 percent of small business owners said they did not want to borrow more money.2 The key is 
learning to manage capital carefully and knowing the right kind of capital to raise for the right 
needs in your business. The goal should not be to raise as much capital as you can; you should 
raise only as much as your business needs.
When searching for the capital to launch their companies, entrepreneurs must remember the 
following “secrets” to successful financing:
● Choosing the right sources of capital for a business can be just as important as choos-
ing the right form of ownership or the right location. It is a decision that will influence a 
company for a lifetime, and entrepreneurs must weigh their options carefully before com-
mitting to a particular funding source. “It is important that companies in need of capital 
align themselves with sources that best fit their needs,” says one financial consultant. “The 
success of a company often depends on the success of that relationship.”3
● The money is out there; the key is knowing where to look. Entrepreneurs must do their 
homework before they set out to raise money for their ventures. Understanding which 
sources of funding are best suited for the various stages of a company’s growth and then 
taking the time to learn how those sources work is essential to success.
● Raising money takes time and effort. Sometimes entrepreneurs are surprised at the en-
ergy and time required to raise the capital needed to feed their cash-hungry, growing busi-
nesses. The process usually includes lots of promising leads, most of which turn out to be 
dead-ends. Meetings with and presentations to lots of potential investors and lenders can
crowd out the time needed to manage a growing company. Entrepreneurs also discover that 
raising capital is an ongoing job. “The fund-raising game is a marathon, not a sprint,” says 
Jerusha Stewart, founder of iSpiritus Soul Spa, a store selling personal growth and well-
being products.4
● Creativity counts. Although some traditional sources of funds now play a lesser role
in small business finance than in the past, other sources—from large corporations and
customers to international venture capitalists and state or local programs—are taking 
up the slack. To find the financing their businesses demand, entrepreneurs must use
as much creativity in attracting financing as they did in generating the ideas for their 
products and services. For instance, after striking out with traditional sources of fund-
ing, EZConserve, a company that makes software that provides energy management 
tools for large PC networks, turned to the nonprofit group Northwest Energy Effi-
ciency Alliance and received a sizable grant as well as marketing assistance that fueled
its growth.5
● The Internet puts at entrepreneurs’ fingertips vast resources of information that can 
lead to financing. Use it. The Internet offers entrepreneurs, especially those looking for 
relatively small amounts of money, the opportunity to discover sources of funds they other-
wise might miss. The Internet also provides a low-cost convenient way for entrepreneurs to 
get their business plans into potential investors’ hands anywhere in the world.

CHAPTER 13 • SOURCES OF FINANCING: EQUITY AND DEBT
499
● Put social media to work to locate potential investors. Social media such as Facebook, 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and others are useful tools for locating potential investors. For example,
LinkedIn has several groups that help investors and entrepreneurs connect with each other, 
such as Angel Investors, Impact Investors, and Angel Investor Group.
● Be thoroughly prepared before approaching potential lenders and investors. In the hunt 
for capital, tracking down leads is tough enough; don’t blow a potential deal by failing to 
be ready to present your business idea to potential lenders and investors in a clear, concise,
convincing way. That, of course, requires a solid business plan and a well-rehearsed eleva-
tor pitch—one or two minutes on the nature of your business and the source of its competi-
tive edge to win over potential investors and lenders. “Entrepreneurs who come across with 
unsubstantiated market assessments, no competitive analysis, and flimsy marketing and 
sales plans will be the losers in the race to money,” says venture capitalist John May.6
● Entrepreneurs cannot overestimate the importance of making sure that the “chemistry” 
among themselves, their companies, and their funding sources is a good one. Too many 
entrepreneurs get into financial deals because they need the money to keep their businesses 
growing only to discover that their plans do not match those of their financial partners.
● Plan an exit strategy. Although it may seem peculiar for entrepreneurs to plan an exit 
strategy for investors when they are seeking capital to start their businesses, doing so in
t
-
creases their chances of closing a deal. Investors do not put their money into a business
with the intent of leaving it there indefinitely. Their goal is to get their money back—along 
with an attractive return on it. Entrepreneurs who fail to define potential exit strategies for 
their investors reduce the likelihood of getting the capital their companies need to grow.
● When capital gets tight, remember to bootstrap. Because capital is tighter for small busi-
nesses, don’t forget to use some of the clever ways you employed to get your business go-
ing when you had limited funds. Bootstrapping is not just for start-ups!
Rather than rely primarily on a single source of funds as they have in the past, entrepreneurs 
must piece together capital from multiple sources, a method known as layered financing. They 
have discovered that raising capital successfully requires them to cast a wide net to capture the 
financing they need to launch their businesses.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John and Patrick Collison: Stripe After launching their 
first company and selling it in just ten months, brothers John and Patrick Collison launched 
Stripe, an online payments company, with their own money. While working on several projects, 
Patrick realized how difficult taking online payments was for merchants and decided that he and 
his brother could develop a better method. They tested their simple payment solution with online
shoppers, made the necessary modifications, and landed a spot (and the  seed financing that came 
with it) in Y Combinator, a prestigious business accelerator in Mountain View, California. Stripe
grew quickly, and the Collisons secured investments from several high profile angel investors, in-
cluding entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, and eventually venture capital firms. Just four 
years after start-up, the Collisons had raised more than $120 million in capital, and Stripe was 
worth an estimated $1.75 billion.7 ■
This chapter will guide you through the myriad financing options available to entrepreneurs, 
focusing on both sources of equity (ownership) and debt (borrowed) financing. Becoming a suc-
cessful entrepreneur requires one to become a skilled fund-raiser, a job that usually requires more
time and energy than most business founders realize. In start-up companies, raising capital can 
easily consume as much as one-half of the entrepreneur’s time and can take many months to com-
plete. In addition, many entrepreneurs find it necessary to raise capital constantly to fuel the hefty 
capital appetites of their young, fast-growing companies. Although the amount an entrepreneur 
needs to launch a start-up varies significantly by the type of business being launched, the Global 
Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that new entrepreneurs need on average about $15,000 to start 
their businesses and an additional $16,000 in funding after start-up.8 However, these “small”
amounts of capital can be most difficult to secure.
Capital is any form of wealth employed to produce more wealth. It exists in many forms in 
a typical business, including cash, inventory, plant, and equipment. Entrepreneurs have access to 
two different types of capital: equity and debt.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Equity Capital versus Debt Capital
Equity capital represents the personal investment of the owner (or owners) in a business and 
is sometimes called risk capital because these investors assume the primary risk of losing their 
l
funds if the business fails. If a venture succeeds, however, founders and investors share in the 
benefits, which can be quite substantial. The founders of and early investors in Yahoo!, Sun 
Microsystems, Federal Express, Intel, and Microsoft became multimillionaires when the com-
panies went public and their equity investments finally paid off. Michael Moritz, a partner in 
the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, recalls a meeting in 1999 that took place around a 
ping-pong table that doubled as a conference table for Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the founders
of a start-up company that had developed a search engine called Google. The young company had 
just changed its name from Backrub and had only 12 employees when Moritz agreed to invest 
$25 million in exchange for 16 percent of the company’s stock. When Google made an initial 
public offering five years later, Moritz’s original investment was worth $3 billion!9
To entrepreneurs, the primary advantage of equity capital is that it does not have to be repaid 
like a loan does. Equity investors are entitled to share in the company’s earnings (if there are any) 
and usually to have a voice in the company’s future direction. The primary disadvantage of equity 
capital is that the entrepreneur must give up some—sometimes even most—of the ownership in
t
the business to outsiders. Although 50 percent of something is better than 100 percent of noth-
ing, giving up control of a company can be disconcerting and dangerous. Entrepreneurs are most 
likely to give up significant amounts of equity in their businesses in the start-up phase than in any
other. To avoid having to give up control of their companies early on, entrepreneurs should strive 
to launch their companies with the least amount of money possible.
Debt capital is the financing an entrepreneur borrows and must repay with interest. Very
few entrepreneurs have adequate personal savings to finance the total start-up costs of a small 
business; many of them must rely on some form of debt capital to launch their companies. 
Lenders of capital are more numerous than investors, but small business loans can be just as 
difficult (if not more difficult) to obtain. Although borrowed capital allows entrepreneurs to 
maintain complete ownership of their businesses, it must be carried as a liability on the balance 
sheet, and it must be repaid with interest in the future. In addition, because lenders consider 
small businesses to be greater risks than bigger corporate customers, they require higher inter-
est rates on loans to small companies because of the risk–return trade-off: The higher the risk,
the greater the return demanded. Most small firms pay the prime rate—the interest rate banks 
charge their most creditworthy customers—plus
—
 a few percentage points. Still, the cost of debt 
financing often is lower than that of equity financing. Because of the higher risks associated 
with providing equity capital to small companies, investors demand greater returns than lend-
ers. In addition, unlike equity financing, debt financing does not require entrepreneurs to dilute
their ownership interest in their companies. We now turn our attention to eight common sources 
of equity capital.
Sources of Equity Financing
Personal Savings
The first place entrepreneurs should look for start-up money is in their own pockets. It’s the
t
least expensive source of funds available! A start-up has very little if any financial history, and 
investors view investments in early-stage companies as high risk. Therefore, the earlier in the 
life of the company that an entrepreneur must raise capital, the more he or she will likely have to 
give up in ownership to secure that financing. Entrepreneurs apparently see the benefits of self-
sufficiency; tapping their personal savings and using creative, low-cost start-up methods, a tech-
nique known as bootstrapping, is one of the most common sources of funds used to start a business. 
According to a survey by the Kauffman Foundation and LegalZoom, more than 86 percent of 
U.S. entrepreneurs use personal savings and assets as a primary source of financing for their start-
ups.10 However, it is not just small businesses that rely on personal savings. A recent survey of 
companies in the Inc. 500 List of America’s Fastest Growing Companies finds that 77 percent of the 
entrepreneurs who founded these high-growth ventures also relied on personal savings to help 
fund their businesses.11 The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey reports that entrepreneurs

in the U.S. rely on personal savings for 73 percent of total funding (see Figure 13.1).12 Bootstrap-
pers learn quickly to be frugal and stretch the income-generating power of every dollar, espe-
cially when most or all of those dollars come from their personal savings.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Sandi Bryant: Americare Pharmacy Sandi Bryant, 
founder of Americare Pharmacy in Fairview, North Carolina, needed $300,000 to open her
long-term care pharmacy business. To fund the business, Bryant used $100,000 from her retire-
ment savings and took out a personal loan using her home as collateral. Although she and her 
husband were anxious about taking the risk, after analyzing how many prescriptions she would 
have to fill to break even, they decided that investing their personal savings was worth the  risk.
Americare Pharmacy broke even after only eight months, and Bryant is now able draw a good 
salary and put money into her retirement account.13 ■
Lenders and investors expect entrepreneurs to put their own money into a business start-up.
t
If an entrepreneur is not willing to risk his or her own money, potential investors are not likely 
to risk their money in the business either. Furthermore, failing to put up sufficient capital of their 
own means that entrepreneurs must either borrow an excessive amount of capital or give up a 
significant portion of ownership to outsiders to fund the business properly. Excessive borrowing 
in the early days of a business puts intense pressure on its cash flow, and becoming a minority
shareholder may dampen a founder’s enthusiasm for making a business successful.
Friends and Family Members
Although most entrepreneurs look to their own bank accounts first to finance a busi-
ness, few have sufficient resources to launch their businesses alone. After emptying
their own pockets, where should entrepreneurs turn for capital? The second place most 
entrepreneurs look is to friends and family members who might be willing to invest in 
(or lend to) a business venture. Because of their relationships with the founder, these
people are most likely to invest. Often they are more patient than other outside inves-
tors and are less meddlesome in a business’s affairs (but not always!) than many other 
types of investors.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tom Haarlander: ARCiPLEX Tom Haarlander, 
President of ARCiPLEX, Nashville, Tennessee, has relied on friends and family for 
most of the funding needs of the company he cofounded. Although Haarlander often 
has been uncomfortable with the responsibility of using friends’ and family members’
money, he has had to rely on their support to fund the early growth of his business. In
every situation, Haarlander sets up a formal agreement that pays interest every month 
to those who lend ARCiPLEX money to show his intention to pay them back. Haarlander 
has always been aggressive in using any excess cash flow to pay back the principal on the 
loans from friends and family, sometimes to the detriment of the business. By keeping
any funding from friends and family structured as a loan, Haarlander says he has been
able to keep good relationships with all of those who have helped fund his business.14 ■

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Investments from family and friends are an important source of capital for entrepreneurs,
but the amounts invested typically are small, often no more than just a few thousand dollars. Ac-
cording to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, entrepreneurs in the United States receive about 
9 percent of total funding from friends and family.15
Investments (or loans) from family and friends are an excellent source of seed capital and 
can get a start-up far enough along to attract money from private investors or venture capital
companies. Inherent dangers lurk in family business investments and loans, however. One study
reports a default rate of 14 percent on business loans from family and friends, compared to a
default rate of 1 percent for bank loans.16 Unrealistic expectations or misunderstood risks have
destroyed many friendships and have ruined many family gatherings. Remember: Thanksgiving 
comes around every year! To avoid problems, an entrepreneur must honestly present the invest-
ment opportunity and the nature of the risks involved to avoid alienating friends and family 
members if the business fails. Smart entrepreneurs treat family members and friends who invest 
in their companies in the same way they would treat outside investors. Some investments in
start-up companies return more than friends and family members ever could have imagined. In
1995, Mike and Jackie Bezos invested $300,000 in their son Jeff’s start-up business, Amazon
.com. Today, Mike and Jackie own 6 percent of Amazon.com’s stock, and their shares are worth 
billions of dollars!17 The accompanying “Hands On . . . How To” feature offers suggestions for 
structuring successful family or friendship financing deals.
Crowd Funding
Historically, securities laws limited who can invest in small businesses. Investing in entrepreneur-
ial businesses has been the realm of those with the knowledge and financial ability to assume the
risks that come with such investments. Known as accredited investors, these people must have a
sustained net worth (excluding their primary residence) of at least $1 million or annual income of at 
least $200,000. There are between 5 million and 7.2 million accredited investors in the United States; 
however, only about 756,000 of these accredited investors have made direct investments in entre-
preneurial businesses.18A few creative entrepreneurs have used a loophole to raise money from in-
vestors who do not meet the requirements of accredited investors using a funding technique called 
crowdfunding. Crowdfunding taps the power of the Internet and social networking and allows 
entrepreneurs to post their elevator pitches and proposed investment terms on specialized Web 
sites and raise money from ordinary people who invest as little as $100. Crowdfunding primarily 
has been used to help raise money to support social causes, help fund aspiring artists, or support 
local small business start-ups. The money received from crowdfunding had to be considered a 
contribution or a donation, rather than an investment. In most cases, entrepreneurs offer some 
accredited investors

503
Tapping family members and friends for start-up capital, whether 
in the form of equity or debt financing, is a popular method of fi-
nancing business ideas. In a typical year, some 6 million individuals 
in the United States invest about $100 billion in entrepreneur-
ial ventures. Unfortunately, not all of these deals work to the 
satisfaction of both parties. The following suggestions can help 
entrepreneurs avoid needlessly destroying family relationships and
friendships:
•
Family should not be your first financing option. Loans 
and investments from family members should never be con-
sidered the easy option for financing a business. Make sure 
you have done everything you can to bootstrap your business
to minimize the cash you actually will need before turning to
family for help.
•
Choose your financier carefully. One of the first issues 
to consider is the impact of the investment on everyone 
involved. Will it work a hardship on the investor or lender? 
Is the investor putting up the money because he or she 
wants to or because he or she feels obligated? Can all par-
ties afford the loan if the business folds? No matter how 
much capital you may need, accepting more than fam-
ily members or friends can afford to lose is a recipe for 
disaster—and perhaps bankruptcy for the investors. Lynn 
McPhee used $250,000 from family members to launch 
Xuny, a Web-based clothing store. Her basic rule was that if 
the investment would cause any financial distress or poten-
tial hardship, she would not accept their money. Remember 
that relationships often suffer if a business fails and friends 
and family members lose their money.
•
Keep the arrangement strictly business. The parties 
should treat all loans and investments in a business-like 
manner, no matter how close the friendship or family rela-
tionship, to avoid problems down the line. If the transaction 
is a loan exceeding $10,000, it must carry a rate of interest 
at least as high as the IRS minimum rate; otherwise, the 
Internal Revenue Service may consider the loan a gift and 
penalize the lender. Treat family investors just like any other
early stage investor in the business.
•
Prepare a business plan. Treat friends and family mem-
bers just as you would angel investors, bankers, venture 
capitalists, and other professionals by doing your research 
and preparing a business plan. The most important use of 
a business plan is to communicate the business model to 
potential investors, so prepare a thoroughly researched busi-
ness plan and go over it carefully with any potential family 
members interested in providing funding for the business. 
Be honest and be clear about the worst-case scenario in 
your plan.
•
Settle the details up front. Before any money changes 
hands, both parties must agree on the details of the deal. 
How much money is involved? Is it a loan or an investment? 
How will the investor cash out? How will the loan be paid 
off? What happens if the business fails?
•
Create a written contract. Don’t make the mistake of 
closing a financial deal with just a handshake. The prob-
ability of misunderstandings skyrockets! Putting an agree-
ment in writing demonstrates the parties’ commitment to 
the deal and minimizes the chances of disputes from faulty 
memories and misunderstandings.
•
Treat the money as “bridge financing.” Although family 
and friends can help you launch your business, it is unlikely 
that they can provide enough capital to sustain it over the 
long term. Sooner or later, you will need to establish a rela-
tionship with other sources of credit if your company is to 
survive and thrive. Consider money from family and friends 
as a bridge to take your company to the next level of financ-
ing, as seen in the Entrepreneurial Profile of Tom Haarlander 
in this chapter.
•
Develop a payment schedule that suits both the 
entrepreneur and the lender or investor. One of the 
primary benefits of financing from family members and 
friends is that the repayment or cash-out schedule usually 
is flexible. Although lenders and investors may want to get 
their money back as quickly as possible, a rapid repayment 
or cash-out schedule can jeopardize a fledgling company’s 
survival. Establish a realistic repayment plan that works for 
the parties without putting excessive strain on your young 
company’s cash flow. Family members are usually more than 
willing to be patient funders of your business.
•
Have an exit plan. Every deal should define exactly how 
investors will “cash out” their investments or loans.

nominal benefit in return for financial support. For example, a musician might show appreciation
to contributors by giving them a free download of a new song. Likewise, an owner of a new restau-
rant may offer each contributor a special discount. The contributions are motivated by the desire 
to help out the aspiring musician or restaurateur. The most commonly used websites that promote 
traditional crowdfunding are Kickstarter, Rock the Post, and IndieGoGo. AngelList is a crowd-
funding site for accredited angel investors looking to make small investments. Kiva and Accion 
are crowd lending sites that link small businesses with people willing to provide micro loans.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Erin Anderson and Dan Ellsworth: Daniel Ellsworth &
The Great Lakes Erin Anderson is the manager for an up-and-coming band called Daniel
Ellsworth & The Great Lakes. Anderson and Ellsworth set up a crowdfunding campaign for the 
band’s newest release on a crowdfunding site, Pledge Music, which helps them run a pre-order 
campaign through the band’s Web site to raise funding and predict initial demand for new 
T-shirts, CDs, vinyl albums, and posters. They were able to use the money raised through the 
Pledge Music campaign to print the T-shirts and posters and produce CDs and albums. The cam-
paign also helped them predict future demand, which helped them order the right amount of 
inventory.19 ■
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 significantly expands the use of 
crowdfunding as a way to raise equity investment for small businesses. Once this law is fully
enacted, those who provide funding can now become equity investors with ownership in the 
business. The JOBS Act opens up funding of start-ups to a much broader group of investors who 
do not meet the legal criteria to be considered accredited investors. To be eligible for crowdfund-
ing, a business have less than $1 billion in annual revenue. An eligible business can raise up to 
$1 million from a crowdfunding offering each year. The first phase of the JOBS Act opened up 
crowdfunding only to accredited investors. Eventually, the JOBS Act will open up equity-based 
crowdfunding to any investor. When the law is fully enacted, it will establish a ceiling on an indi-
vidual’s crowdfunding investment that is based on his or her income and net worth. The original 
goal of the JOBS Act was to allow anyone to invest some amount in a business start-up. When the 
law is finally fully implemented, entrepreneurs no longer will be limited to only seeking funding 
from accredited investors.20
Attracting investors through crowdfunding, particularly traditional crowdfunding Web sites, 
requires a different approach than an entrepreneur uses when pursuing more sophisticated and 
experienced investors. Unlike experienced investors who invest more in people than in their 
ideas, crowdfunding investors tend to be attracted to compelling stories and business ideas they
can see themselves using. Crowdfunding works through social media, so the entrepreneur’s exist-
ing network of contacts must be advocates to lend credibility to the business among the broader 
network.21 Although the JOBS Act will eventually significantly broaden the pool of people
who can invest in small businesses, it also creates new challenges for entrepreneurs who use
crowdfunding. Crowdfunding may complicate future fundraising if an entrepreneur uses layered 
financing, so entrepreneurs should seek advice from financing experts to develop a long-term
financing plan. Crowdfunding creates a large number of owners who all have certain expecta-
tions and may require attention from the entrepreneur. If adding one additional partner increases 
the complexity of running a business, imagine what a crowd of partners can do to complicate an
entrepreneur’s life! The accompanying “Hands On . . . How To” feature offers some additional 
cautions when using crowdfunding to finance a small business.
Accelerators
Inexperienced entrepreneurs have difficulty finding early stage seed funding. The first-time en-
trepreneur doesn’t have the credibility to attract professional investors and typically doesn’t have 
the personal wealth required to launch a business. To help bridge this gap in funding, many com-
munities and universities have established accelerator programs that offer new entrepreneurs a
small amount of seed capital and a wealth of additional support. Accelerator programs help move 
entrepreneurs from the idea stage to a point when the business has a proven story and a strong
business model that the founder can pitch for more significant funding. Accelerators offer a struc-
tured program that lasts from three months to one year. A select group of entrepreneurs, typically
10 to 20, are invited to participate as a group in an accelerator program. The accelerator provides

programs, often sponsored 
by communities and univer-
sities, that provide a small 
amount of seed capital and 
a wealth of additional sup-
port for start-up companies. 

CHAPTER 13 • SOURCES OF FINANCING: EQUITY AND DEBT
505
Crowdfunding Web sites, such as Kickstarter, are a popular way 
for small start-ups to get seed funding. There are many success 
stories of companies that got the start-up capital they needed for 
a successful launch through a crowdfunding campaign.
Nathan Resnick, founder of Yes Man Watches, had hoped to 
raise $15,000 using Kickstarter to launch his online retail watch
business. Resnick used blogs that write about watches to help 
build buzz about his new business and its Kickstarter campaign. 
He asked all of his contacts to post on Twitter and Facebook about 
Yes Man Watches, sending them pictures of his watches they 
could include with their posts. When his campaign went live, he 
had strong support the first day and was able to exceed his goal 
by raising more than $32,000.
Ilene Ruvinsky, cofounder of a skin care company called Don’t 
Call Me Ma’am, developed a video to support her fundraising 
campaign on the crowdfunding site Fundable.com. She spent her 
own money producing the video in hopes that its quality would 
result in even more funding from her crowdfunding campaign. 
Ruvinsky met her goal of raising $20,000 through Fundable.com, 
and the business is moving toward a launch of its product line.
The Dark Side of Crowdfunding
Not every crowdfunding story has a happy ending, however.
Seth Quest launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $10,000
in seed money to help launch his iPad stand called Hanfree. He 
put a photo of a prototype on his Kickstarter fundraising page. 
The description on the Kickstarter page said that for a minimum 
pledge of $50, backers could preorder a Hanfree, which would be
made in San Francisco, California, out of sustainably forested alder 
wood. He also promised that each one would be hand-numbered 
and signed by the designer. The campaign was a success, raising
more than $35,000 from 440 backers.
However, the excitement over Quest’s fundraising success
quickly faded. Quest had no business experience and had never 
manufactured a product before. As a result, he was unable to fill 
the preorders as promised. Some of the backers became angry, 
and soon there were hundreds of negative comments on Hanfree’s 
Kickstarter page. Quest realized that he was not going to be able 
to fill the orders, so he posted a promise that he planned to refund 
the money given by the backers. However, after several weeks with
no refund, some of the backers decided to take action against 
Quest. One of the backers filed a breach of contract lawsuit against 
Quest, which eventually forced Quest to file for bankruptcy.
Avoiding a Kickstarter Disaster
Crowdfunding remains a popular tool for entrepreneurs to use 
to help get hard-to-find seed capital. When approached care-
fully, crowdfunding can be a highly effective means for rais-
ing funding. The following suggestions can help entrepreneurs 
avoid creating disastrous situations when raising money using 
crowdfunding:
•
Start with a business plan. Although business plans 
are not required by crowdfunding Web sites, it is always 
advisable to develop one as part of your preparation. 
Remember, one of the most important uses of a busi-
ness plan is to communicate with investors and bankers. 
Although Kickstarter backers are not technically investors, 
developing a plan that spells out what you will do with the 
money and how you will achieve what you promise benefits 
both investors and the entrepreneur.
•
Have contracts in place. Because crowdfunding usu-
ally involves some sort of a product, make sure you have 
contacts in place with suppliers or outsource manufacturers 
to ensure that you can deliver what you promise at the price 
you have planned for in your projections and budgets.
•
Be honest about the risks. If there are risks and chal-
lenges that may prevent you from delivering a product, be 
open and honest about all of these risks in the information 
you present at the crowdfunding Web site. Doing so avoids 
nasty surprises if things do not go as planned.
•
Remember that backers view themselves as custom-
ers, not investors. When people provide backing for your 
project, they are assuming that they have placed a preorder 
with you that you will fulfill. They do not view themselves as 
investors who may or may not get any return for the money 
they give you.

join the mentor team as investors in businesses that “graduate” from the accelerator program. 
Private accelerators are located in most major cities, and a growing number of universities have 
accelerator programs to assist student and alumni entrepreneurs.
Two of the largest accelerator programs are Y Combinator and TechStars. Although accel-
erators do provide small investments, the most important contribution they offer is the coaching 
and mentoring from angel investors and experienced entrepreneurs. Angel investors work along-
side the founding entrepreneurs, serving as mentors and advisers. As a result, they help to shape 
the business model of the companies in which they invest. The Techstars accelerator program 
reports that 70 percent of its participants receive subsequent funding after going through the 
program. An amazing 94 percent of businesses launched through the Y Combinator accelerator 
program receive additional funding.22
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jake Gish: Beyond Right Now Technologies Jake Gish
has used two different accelerator programs to help his start-up, Beyond Right Now Tech-
nologies. Gish plans to create several products that use the latest technology for resource conserva-
tion and management, crop health monitoring, endangered species conservation, land mapping, 
seed and spore dispersal, and delivery of mitigating solutions. The first accelerator program he 
participated in was the Next Farm Agriculture Innovation Accelerator based at Northwest Tennessee
Entrepreneur Center in Martin, Tennessee, which helped Gish formulate his basic business model.
After completing the Next Farm accelerator, he was accepted into the JumpStart Foundry accelera-
tor in Nashville, Tennessee. “Accelerator programs helped me decide exactly which product and 
customer to focus on,” says Gish. “Going into the programs we had enough ideas for over a dozen 
products for even more customers. Accelerators [also] helped us craft a pitch tailored to communi-
cate clearly to possible investors, strategic partners, and customers.”23 In the JumpStart Foundry 
accelerator, Gish plans to develop a lead product: Pig Punisher. This product is a drone that helps 
hunt feral hogs, which are responsible for billions of dollars in crop losses, property damage, and 
degradation of water quality. A growing concern is that feral hogs carry diseases that infect 
domestic livestock. The Pig Punisher has an exclusive license for a tool developed at Oak Ridge 
National Laboratories that helps identify from an aerial drone feral hogs that are infected.24 ■
Angels
After dipping into their own pockets and convincing friends and relatives to invest in their busi-
ness ventures, many entrepreneurs still find themselves short of the seed capital they need. 
Frequently, the next stop on the road to business financing is private investors. These private 
investors (angels) are wealthy individuals, often entrepreneurs themselves, who are accredited 
investors and choose to invest their own money in business start-ups in exchange for equity
stakes in the companies. Angel investors have provided much-needed capital to entrepreneurs for 
many years. In 1938, when World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker needed money to launch 
Eastern Airlines, millionaire Laurance Rockefeller provided it.25 Alexander Graham Bell, inven-
tor of the telephone, used angel capital to start Bell Telephone in 1877. More recently, companies 
such as Google, Apple, Starbucks, Kinko’s, and the Body Shop relied on angel financing in their 
early years to finance growth.
In many cases, angels invest in businesses for more than purely economic reasons—for 
example, because they have a personal interest or experience in a particular industry—and they 
are willing to put money into companies in the earliest stages, long before venture capital firms 
and institutional investors jump in. Angel financing, the fastest-growing segment of the small 
business capital market, is ideal for companies that have outgrown the capacity of investments 
from friends and family but are still too small to attract the interest of venture capital companies.
Angel financing is vital to the nation’s small business sector because it fills this capital gap in
which small companies need investments ranging from $100,000 or less to perhaps $5 million or 
more. For instance, after raising the money to launch Amazon.com from family and friends, Jeff 
Bezos turned to angels for capital because venture capital firms were not interested in investing 
in a business start-up. Bezos attracted $1.2 million from a dozen angels before landing $8 million 
from venture capital firms a year later.26
Angels are a primary source of start-up capital for companies in the start-up stage through the
growth stage, and their role in financing small businesses is significant. Research at the University 
of New Hampshire shows that nearly 299,000 angels and angel groups invest $24.8 billion a year

in more than 70,000 small companies, most of them in the start-up phase.27 In short, angels are 
one of the largest and most important sources of external equity capital for small businesses. Their 
investments in young companies nearly match those of professional venture capitalists, providing 
vital capital to 18 times as many small companies (see Figure 13.2).
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Carter Cleveland: Artsy Artsy, founded by computer sci-
entist Carter Cleveland, seeks to make all of the world’s art accessible to anyone with an
Internet connection. It is an online platform for discovering, learning about, and collecting art. 
Artsy provides one of the largest collections of contemporary art available online by partnering 
with galleries to help broaden their target markets. Artsy’s revenues come from the artwork it 
sells on behalf of its gallery partners. The business model has proved so effective that the company
has 1,000 additional galleries on a waiting list to join the Artsy network. Artsy has received invest-
ments from more than 20 individual angel investors as well as significant venture capital 
funding. After raising more than $1.4 million in angel seed investments, Artsy had a successful 
round of venture capital financing of $6 million. The company is currently raising a new round of 
up to $18.5 million from venture capital firms.28 ■
Angels fill a significant gap in the seed capital market. They are most likely to finance 
start-ups with capital requirements in the $10,000 to $2 million range, well below the $5 million 
to $10 million minimum investments most professional venture capitalists prefer. The average 
angel investment (including angel funds and networks) in a company is $350,000.29 Because a
$1 million deal requires about as much of a venture capitalist’s time to research and evaluate as 
a $20 million deal, venture capitalists tend to focus on big deals where their returns are bigger.
Because angels tend to invest in the earliest stages of a business, they incur the highest levels of 
risk. In fact, 52 percent of angels’ investments lose money, returning less than the angels’ original
investment. The potential for investing in big winners exists as well; 7 percent of angels’ invest-
ments produce a return of more than 10 times their original investments.30
Lewis Gersh, an experienced angel investor, says that out of 10 companies that an angel in-
vests in, 5 will fail, 2 will break even, and 2 will return two to three times the original investment. 
Just 1 company in 10 will produce a significant return. All of the deals will be high potential, but 
with high potential comes high risk. Most angels consider a “home-run” investment to be one 
that results in a return of 10 to 30 times the original investment in five to seven years, somewhat 
lower than the returns venture capital firms expect.31 Because of the inherent risks in start-up

companies, many venture capitalists have shifted their investment portfolios away from start-ups 
toward more established businesses. That’s why angel financing is so important: Angels often
finance deals that no venture capitalist will consider.
Angels accept between 10 and 15 percent of the deals pitched to them and invest an average 
of $50,000 in a company that is at the seed or start-up growth stages.32 Most angels are seasoned
entrepreneurs themselves; on average, angel investors have founded 2.7 companies and have 
14.5 years of entrepreneurial experience. They also are well educated; 99 percent have college 
degrees. Research also shows that 86 percent of angel investors are men (their average age is 
57 years) who have been investing in promising small companies for nine years. The typical 
angel invests in one company per year.33 When evaluating a proposal, angels look for a qualified 
management team (generally not just an individual entrepreneur) and a business with a clearly
defined niche, market potential, and competitive advantage. They also want to see market re-
search that proves the existence of a sizable customer base and a viable exit strategy, the avenue
by which they get their investments back, ideally with a handsome return. Angels want a path 
to a clean exit for their investment, rather than a business that might yield dividends over time.
Entrepreneurs in search of capital quickly learn that the real challenge lies in finding angels.
Most angels have substantial business and financial experience, and many of them are entrepre-
neurs or former entrepreneurs. Because most angels frown on “cold calls” from entrepreneurs they
don’t know, locating them boils down to making the right contacts. Networking is the key. Asking 
friends, attorneys, bankers, stockbrokers, accountants, other business owners, and consultants for 
suggestions and introductions is a good way to start. Many angel investors use their attorneys and
accountants as gatekeepers for potential deals. Angels almost always invest their money locally,
so entrepreneurs should look close to home for them—typically within a 50- to 100-mile radius.
In fact, 7 out of 10 angels invest in companies that are within 50 miles of their homes or offices.34
Angels also look for businesses they know something about, and most expect to invest their 
knowledge, experience, and energy as well as their money in a company. In fact, the advice and 
the network of contacts that angels bring to a deal can sometimes be as valuable as their money!
Angel investing has become more organized and professional than it was 20 years ago, with 
investors pooling their resources to form angel networks and angel capital funds, dubbed “super-
angels,” that operate like miniature versions of professional venture capital firms and draw on 
investors’ skills, experience, and contacts to help the start-ups in which they invest to succeed.
Today more than 300 angel capital networks operate in cities of all sizes across the United States 
(up from just 10 in 1996). Angel networks make the task of locating angels much easier for 
entrepreneurs in search of capital.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Crista Freeman: Phin & Phebes Ice Cream Crista Freeman,
CEO and cofounder of Phin & Phebes Ice Cream, launched her business with the help of an 
investment by angel investor William Hines, who was part of the company’s $150,000 seed fund-
ing round. Phin & Phebes Ice Cream is made with no preservatives, conventional stabilizers, or 
syrups of any kind. It is made with milk, cream, sugar, and egg yolks. Phin & Phebes has expanded 
into 22 states and more than 260 stores in its first three years in business. Its products are sold in 
stores such as Whole Foods, Earth Fare, Central Market, Gourmet Garage, Fresh Direct, and Mor-
ton Williams. In its second round of funding, Phin & Phebes is raising $5 million in capital to fund 
its continued growth. The second round of fundraising includes investments by two angel inves-
tors, Brad Feld and Joanne Wilson. Feld is part of Foundry Group, which is a venture capital and
angel investment group in Boulder, Colorado. Wilson is a businesswoman from New York City who
Y
is an active angel investor.35 ■
The Internet has expanded greatly the ability of entrepreneurs in search of capital and angels
in search of businesses to find one another. Dozens of angel networks have set up shop on the
Internet many of which are members of the Angel Capital Association. The association reports 
that its average member group has 42 investors and makes investments in four small companies
each year.36 Entrepreneurs can expand the scope of their hunt for financing by including online 
angel groups and the Angel Capital Association’s membership list in their searches. AngelList is
another Web site that connects angel investors with high potential deals.
Angels are an excellent source of “patient money,” often willing to wait seven years or longer 
to cash out their investments. They earn their returns through the increased value of the business, 

CHAPTER 13 • SOURCES OF FINANCING: EQUITY AND DEBT
509
not through dividends and interest. For example, more than 1,000 early investors in Microsoft 
Inc. are now multimillionaires. Angels’ return-on-investment targets tend to be lower than those 
of professional venture capitalists. Although venture capitalists shoot for 60 to 75 percent returns 
annually, angel investors usually settle for 20 to 50 percent (depending on the level of risk in-
volved in the venture). A study by the Kauffman Foundation reports that the average return on 
angels’ investments in small companies is 2.6 times the original investment in 3.5 years, which
is the equivalent of a 27 percent internal rate of return.37 Angel investors typically purchase
15 to 30 percent ownership in a small company, leaving the majority ownership to the company 
founder(s). They look for the same exit strategies that venture capital firms look for: either an
initial public offering or a buyout by a larger company. The lesson: If an entrepreneur needs rela-
tively small amounts of money to launch or to grow a company, angels are an excellent source.
Venture Capital Companies
Venture capital companies are private, for-profit organizations that assemble pools of capital
and then use them to purchase equity positions in young businesses they believe have high-
growth and high-profit potential, producing annual returns of 300 to 500 percent within five to 
seven years. More than 400 venture capital firms operate across the United States today, investing 
billions of dollars (see Figure 13.3) in promising small companies in a wide variety of industries. 
Companies in the high-tech hubs in California’s Silicon Valley and Boston’s high-tech corridor 
account for nearly half of all venture capital investments, but “secondary” cities, such as Boulder 
(Colorado), Salt Lake City (Utah), Ann Arbor (Michigan), Providence (Rhode Island), Norwalk 
(Connecticut), and Stamford (Connecticut), offer thriving venture capital sectors that invest sig-
nificant sums of money, especially in local small businesses with high growth potential.38 Venture 
capital firms have invested billions of dollars in high-potential small companies over the years,
including such notable businesses as Google, Apple, FedEx, Netscape, Home Depot, Microsoft, 
Intel, Starbucks, Whole Foods Market, and Genentech.39

Xirrus and successfully raised six rounds of venture capital funding totaling $105.9 million. Venture 
capitalists investing in Xirrus are among the most prominent firms, including August Capital, Ca-
naan Partners, InterWest, QuestMark Partners, and U.S. Venture Partners. These firms participated 
in more than one of the company’s rounds of venture capital funding.40 ■
POLICIES AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES Venture capital firms usually establish stringent policies 
to implement their overall investment strategies.
Investment Size and Screening The average venture capital firm’s investment in a small company
is $7.4 million.41 Depending on the size of the venture capital company, minimum investments 
range from $100,000 to $5 million, but most venture capital firms seek investments in the $5 million 
to $25 million range to justify the cost of screening the large number of proposals they receive.
In a typical year, venture capital firms invest in about 4,000 of the nearly 28 million small 
businesses in the United States. The venture capital screening process is extremely rigorous. 
According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, only about 1 in 1,000 businesses in the United 
States receives venture capital during its existence.42 The typical venture capital firm receives
about 1,200 business plans each year (although some receive many more). For every 100 business 
plans the average venture capital firm receives, 90 of them are rejected immediately because they
do not match the firm’s investment criteria or requirements. The firm conducts a thorough due
diligence investigation of the remaining 10 companies and typically invests in only 1 of them (see 
Figure 13.4). The average time required to close a venture capital deal is 60 to 90 days.
Ownership and Control Most venture capitalists prefer to purchase ownership in a small business
through common stock or convertible preferred stock. Although many venture capital firms 
purchase less than 50 percent of a company’s stock, others buy a controlling share of a company,
leaving its founders with a minority share of ownership. Most venture capitalists prefer to let 
the founding team of managers employ its skills to operate a business if they are capable of 
f
managing its growth. However, it is quite common for venture capitalists to join the boards of 
directors of the companies in which they invest. Sometimes venture investors step in and shake 
up the management teams in the companies in which they invest. Janet Effland, a partner in the
venture capital firm Apax Partners, says her fund changes management in the deals they fund

about 40 percent of the time.43 In other words, entrepreneurs should not expect venture capitalists
t
to be passive investors! Some serve only as financial and managerial advisers, but others take 
an active role managing the company—recruiting employees, providing sales leads, choosing
attorneys and advertising agencies, and making daily decisions. The majority of these active 
venture capitalists say they are forced to step in because the existing management team lacks the
talent and experience to achieve growth targets.
Stage of Investment Most venture capital firms invest in companies that are in either the 
early stages of development (called early-stage investing) or in the rapid-growth phase (called 
expansion-stage investing). About 96 to 98 percent of all venture capital investments go to
businesses in these stages; very few invest in small companies that are in the start-up phase.44
Most venture capital firms do not make just a single investment in a company. Instead, they invest 
in a company over time across several stages, where their investments often total $10 million to 
$15 million or more.
Advice and Contacts In addition to the money they invest, more venture capital companies are 
providing the small companies in their portfolios with management advice and access to valuable 
networks of contacts of suppliers, employees, customers, and other sources of capital than they 
did just a few years ago. One of their goals in doing so is to strengthen the companies in which 
they have invested, thereby increasing their value.
Investment Preferences Venture capital firms now are larger, more professional, and more speci-
alized than they were 25 years ago. As the industry matures, venture capital funds increasingly are 
focusing their investments in niches—everything from information technology to biotechnology. 
Some will invest in almost any industry, but most prefer companies in later stages. Traditionally, 
fewer companies receiving venture capital financing are in the start-up or seed stage, when 
entrepreneurs are forming a company or developing a product or service and when angels are
most likely to invest (see Figure 13.5). Most of the start-up businesses that attract venture capital 
are technology companies in “hot” fields such as software, biotechnology, energy, medical 
devices, and media and entertainment.45
WHAT VENTURE CAPITALISTS LOOK FOR Entrepreneurs must realize that it is difficult for any 
small business, especially fledgling or struggling firms, to pass the intense screening process 
of a venture capital company and qualify for an investment. A great elevator pitch and a sound 
business plan are essential to convincing venture capital firms to invest in a company. Geeta 
Vemuri, a principal in a venture capital firm, says investors want to see proof of concept for deals 
they consider investing in.46 Two factors make a deal attractive to venture capitalists: high returns

and a convenient (and profitable) exit strategy. When evaluating potential investments, venture 
capitalists look for the following features:
Competent Management The most important ingredient in the success of any business is the 
ability of the management team, and venture capitalists understand this. To venture capitalists, 
the ideal management team has experience, managerial skills, commitment, and the ability to 
expand the team as the business grows.
Competitive Edge Investors are searching for some factor that will enable a small business to set 
itself apart from its competitors. This distinctive competence may range from an innovative product 
or service that satisfies unmet customer needs to a unique marketing or research-and-development 
(R&D) approach. It must be something with the potential to create a sustainable competitive edge,
making the company a leader in its industry. Bill Turner, founder of venture capital firm Signature 
Capital, stresses that he looks for transformational business models, such as his investments in an 
online music service, a hearing-aid maker, and an HIV-therapy company.47
Growth Industry Hot industries attract profits—and venture capital. Most venture capital funds 
focus their searches for prospects in rapidly growing fields because they believe the profit 
potential is greater in these areas. Venture capital firms are most interested in young companies 
that have enough growth potential to become at least $100 million businesses within three to
five years. Venture capitalists know that most of the businesses they invest in will flop, so their 
winners have to be big winners.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Chieh Huang: Boxed Chieh Huang, founder and CEO of 
Boxed, is trying to become a giant killer. Huang founded Boxed with the intent of creating
an app to compete with the likes of Amazon, Costco, and Walmart. Boxed is an e-commerce com-
pany (like Amazon) offering discounts on large quantities of bulk items (like Costco). Boxed sells
its products only through a mobile app and ships to customers anywhere in the United States.
Huang raised $6.5 million in an A round of funding that was led by venture capital firms Greycroft 
Ventures, First Round Capital, and Signia Venture Partners. Three other venture capital firms also 
participated in the company’s first round of funding, which Boxed used to complete the develop-
ment of the app and launch the company. Boxed plans to attract customers in the Millennial 
Generation, who typically are not as loyal to companies such as Costco and Sam’s Club, preferring
to shop online.48 ■
Viable Exit Strategy Venture capitalists not only look for promising companies with the ability 
to dominate a market but also want to see a plan for a feasible exit strategy, typically to be 
executed within three to five years. Venture capital firms realize the return on their investments 
when the companies they invest in either make an initial public offering or are acquired by or 
merged into another business. As the market for initial public offerings has softened, venture 
capitalists have had to be more patient in their exit strategies. Venture-backed companies that go 
public now take an average of 5.3 years from the time of their first venture capital investment to 
their stock offering, up from an average of less than three years in 1998.49
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Reid Hoffman: LinkedIn The venture capital firms that 
invested in LinkedIn, the business networking Web site with more than 300 million users in 
200 countries, reaped a handsome return on their investments when the company made an initial 
public offering in 2011. Founder Reid Hoffman guided LinkedIn through five rounds of venture 
financing from firms including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners,
and Bain Capital before making an initial public offering. After the initial public offering, the 
venture capital firms’ investments of $103 million, which gave them a 41.4 percent ownership in 
LinkedIn, were worth $1.76 billion! Hoffman retained 20.1 percent of LinkedIn’s stock, worth 
$853 million at the time of the company’s initial public offering.50 ■
Intangible Factors Some other important factors considered in the screening process are not 
easily measured; they are the intuitive, intangible factors that the venture capitalist detects by gut 
feeling. This feeling might be the result of the small firm’s solid sense of direction, its strategic 
planning process, the chemistry of its management team, or other factors. Venture capital firms 
want to know that entrepreneurs will use their money wisely—for investments that provide 
profitable results and not those that merely feed entrepreneurial egos.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Mark Montgomery: FLO {thinkery} 
and Blue Chair Bay Rum Mark Montgomery, founder of FLO {think-
ery}, CEO of Blue Chair Bay Rum, and angel investor, has sat on both sides of
the table when it comes to equity investments. Montgomery pays close 
attention to every detail when assessing an investment in an entrepreneurial 
venture, particularly early decisions made by the leadership team. “When I go 
into a startup burning $300,000 a month, and they’ve got amazing offices with 
expensive furniture, I immediately think the leadership team’s priorities are 
wrong,” says Montgomery, an angel investor from Nashville, Tennessee. “On 
the other side, I don’t think you should have your people sitting on milk crates
at a ping pong table. Just be practical.”51 ■
Despite its many benefits, venture capital is not suited for every entrepre-
neur. Venture capital investments come with many strings attached and can 
limit entrepreneurs’ ability to navigate their companies as they would prefer.
Corporate Venture Capital
Large corporations have gotten into the business of financing small companies 
and invest in businesses for both strategic and financial reasons. More than
300 large corporations across the globe, including Google, BMW, Comcast,
Amazon, Qualcomm, Intel, General Electric, Dow Chemical, Cisco Systems,
UPS, Wal-Mart, Unilever, and Johnson & Johnson, invest in small companies, usually companies 
that are in the later stage of growth and because of their maturity are less risky. Today, more than 
17 percent of all venture capital deals involve corporate venture capital. The average investment 
that large corporations make in small companies is $4.53 million, which represents 10.6 percent 
of total venture capital investments.52 Young companies not only get a boost from the capital injec-
tions large companies give them but also stand to gain many other benefits from the relationship.
The right corporate partner may share technical expertise, distribution channels, and marketing
know-how and provide introductions to important customers and suppliers. Another intangible yet 
highly important advantage an investment from a large corporate partner gives a small company
is credibility, often referred to as “market validation.” Doors that otherwise would be closed to a
small company magically open when the right corporation becomes a strategic partner.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Google Ventures and Shoaib Makani: KeepTruckin
In 2009, Google launched Google Ventures, the company’s venture capital division, with the 
goal of investing $200 million a year in small companies with fast-growth potential across all stages 
of development. Since its inception, Google Ventures has invested amounts ranging from $200,000 
to $33 million in promising companies in a variety of industries. Although long-haul trucking is not 
an industry that sounds like it would attract an investment from Google, KeepTruckin received a 
seed round of investment of $2.25 million that was led by Google Ventures. Currently, long-haul 
truckers keep and report the logs that track their mileage and hours using pen, paper, and fax 
machines. KeepTruckin plans to automate this process using smart phones. According to Keep-
Truckin cofounder and CEO Shoaib Makani, most of the technological solutions applied to long-
haul trucking have focused on solving corporate problems. KeepTruckin, however, is focused on 
the 3 million truckers in this industry. Its app automatically tracks time and distance driven, gener-
ates log files, and automatically sends the files to a dispatcher. The app also alerts drivers when 
they are over federally mandated driving limits. KeepTruckin plans to move beyond automated 
drive logs into fleet and truck management.53 ■
Public Stock Sale (“Going Public”)
In some cases, companies can “go public” by selling shares of stock to outside investors. In an 
initial public offering (IPO), a company raises capital by selling shares of its stock to the general
public for the first time. An IPO is an effective method of raising large amounts of capital, but 
it can be an expensive and time-consuming process filled with regulatory nightmares. Once a 
company makes an IPO, nothing will ever be the same again. Managers must consider the impact 
of their decisions not only on the company and its employees but also on shareholders and the
value of their stock.

Going public isn’t for every business. In fact, most small companies do not meet the criteria 
for making a successful public stock offering. Since 2001, the average number of companies 
that make IPOs each year is 120, and only about 20,000 companies in the United States—less
than 1 percent of the total—are publicly held (see Figure 13.6). The dramatic drop in the num-
ber of IPOs that occurred in the early part of this century was due in large part to the passage
of Sarbanes-Oxley, a law that put significant restrictions and requirements on publicly traded 
companies. An outcome of this law was to make IPOs unaffordable for smaller companies. Since 
Sarbanes-Oxley became law, few new companies with less than $25 million in annual sales man-
age to go public successfully. Since 2001, 68 percent of the companies that have completed IPOs 
have had annual sales of $50 million or more.54 For instance, LinkedIn, the professional network-
ing Web site, was generating sales of $243 million at the time of its IPO. When Zygna, the creator 
of popular Facebook games such as Farmville, Cityville, and Words with Friends, filed for its 
IPO, the company’s sales were $597 million.55
It is almost impossible for a start-up company with no track record of success to raise money 
with an IPO. Instead, the investment bankers who underwrite public stock offerings typically 
look for established companies with the following characteristics:
● Consistently high growth rates. In the three years prior to its IPO, LinkedIn’s revenues
grew an impressive 212 percent.56
● Scalability. Underwriters and institutional investors want proof that a company can main-
tain or improve its efficiency as it experiences the strain that rapid growth imposes.

CHAPTER 13 • SOURCES OF FINANCING: EQUITY AND DEBT
515
● A strong record of earnings. Strangely enough, profitability at the time of the IPO is 
not essential; from 2001 to 2013, 49 percent of companies making IPOs had negative 
earnings.57
● Three to five years of audited financial statements that meet or exceed Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) standards. After the Enron and WorldCom scandals, inves-
tors are demanding impeccable financial statements.
● A solid position in a rapidly growing industry. In 2000, the median age of companies 
making IPOs was 6 years; today, it is 12 years.58
● A sound management team with experience and a strong board of directors. 
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Shayan Zadeh: Zoosk Shayan Zadeh, cofounder and 
CEO of Zoosk, has taken his business from start-up to IPO in only seven years. During that 
time, the online dating company has amassed 26 million members, which includes 650,000 paid
subscribers, from 80  countries. Although the company has yet to make a profit, it has raised
$61.6 million in venture capital and plans to raise another $100 million in its IPO. Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, and Citigroup Global Markets provided underwriting for Zoosk’s IPO.59 ■
THE REGISTRATION PROCESS Taking a company public is a complicated, bureaucratic process 
that usually takes several months to complete. Many experts compare the IPO process to running 
a corporate marathon, and both the company and its management team must be in shape and
up to the grueling task. The typical entrepreneur cannot take his or her company public alone. 
t
It requires a coordinated effort from a team of professionals, including company executives, an 
accountant, a securities attorney, a financial printer, and at least one underwriter. The key steps in 
taking a company public are as follows:
● Choose the underwriter. The single most important ingredient in making a successful 
IPO is selecting a capable managing underwriter (investment banker). The managing 
underwriter serves two primary roles: helping to prepare the registration statement for the 
issue and promoting the company’s stock to potential investors. The underwriter works 
with company managers as an adviser to prepare the registration statement that must be 
filed with the SEC, promotes the issue, prices the stock, and provides aftermarket support. 
Once the registration statement is finished, the managing underwriter’s primary job is 
selling the company’s stock through an underwriting syndicate of other investment bankers 
it develops.
● Negotiate a letter of intent. To begin an offering, the entrepreneur and the underwriter 
must negotiate a letter of intent, which outlines the details of the deal. The letter of intent 
covers a variety of important issues, including the type of underwriting, its size and price 
range, the underwriter’s commission, and any warrants and options included. It almost al-
ways states that the underwriter is not bound to the offering until it is executed—usually the 
day before or the day of the offering. However, the letter usually creates a binding obliga-
tion for the company to pay any direct expenses the underwriter incurs relating to the offer.
● Prepare the registration statement. After a company signs the letter of intent, the next 
task is to prepare the registration statement to be filed with the SEC. This document 
describes both the company and the stock offering and discloses information about the 
risks of investing. It includes information on the use of the proceeds, the company’s his-
tory, its financial position, its capital structure, the risks it faces, its managers’ experience, 
and many other details. The statement is extremely comprehensive and may take months to
develop. To prepare the statement, entrepreneurs must rely on their team of professionals.
● File with the SEC. When the statement is finished (with the exception of pricing the 
shares, proceeds, and commissions, which cannot be determined until just before the issue 
goes to market), the company officially files the statement with the SEC and awaits the 
review of the Division of Corporate Finance, a process that takes 30 to 45 days (or more). 
The division sends notice of any deficiencies in the registration statement to the company’s 
attorney in a comment letter. The company and its team of professionals must cure all of

the deficiencies in the statement noted in the comment letter. Finally, the company files 
the revised registration statement along with a pricing amendment (giving the price of the 
shares, the proceeds, and the commissions).
● Wait to go effective. While waiting for the SEC’s approval, the managers and the underwrit-
ers are busy. The underwriters are building a syndicate of other underwriters who will market 
the company’s stock. (No stock sales can be made prior to the effective date of the offering, 
however.) The SEC also limits the publicity and information a company may release during 
this quiet period (which officially starts when the company reaches a preliminary agreement 
with the managing underwriter and ends 25 days after the effective date).
● Road show. Securities laws do permit a road show, a gathering of potential syndicate 
members sponsored by the managing underwriter. Its purpose is to promote interest 
among potential underwriters in the IPO by featuring the company, its management, and
the proposed deal. The managing underwriter and key company officials barnstorm major 
financial centers at a grueling pace.
● Sign underwriting agreement. On the last day before the registration statement becomes 
effective, the company signs the formal underwriting agreement. The final settlement, or 
closing, takes place a few days after the effective date for the issue. At this meeting the un-
derwriters receive their shares to sell, and the company receives the proceeds of the offer-
ing. Typically, the entire process of going public takes from 120 to 180 days, but it can take 
much longer if the issuing company is not properly prepared for the process.
● Meet state requirements. In addition to satisfying the SEC’s requirements, a company also
must meet the securities laws in all states in which the issue is sold. These state laws (or 
“blue-sky” laws) vary drastically from one state to another, and the company must comply 
with them.
NONPUBLIC REGISTRATIONS AND EXEMPTIONS The IPO process just described, called an S-1 
filing, requires maximum disclosure in the initial filing and discourages most small businesses 
from using it. Fortunately, the SEC allows several exemptions from this full-disclosure process 
for small businesses seeking to sell stock through a limited private stock offering. Entrepreneurs
can sell stock through a limited private offering to accredited investors, corporations and trusts, 
and insiders to the business. The SEC has established simplified registration statements and 
exemptions from the registration process through what is known as Regulation D (Rule 504, 505, 
and 506).
Regulation D rules minimize the expense and time required to raise equity capital for small 
businesses by simplifying or eliminating the requirement for registering the offering with the 
SEC, which often takes months and costs many thousands of dollars. Under Regulation D, the 
whole process typically costs less than half of what a traditional public offering costs. The SEC’s 
objective in creating Regulation D was to give small companies the access to equity financing
that large companies have via the stock market while bypassing many of the costs and filing re-
quirements. A Regulation D offering requires only minimal notification to the SEC.
Rule 504 is the most popular of the Regulation D exemptions because it is the least restric-
tive. It allows a company to sell shares of its stock to an unlimited number of investors without 
regard to their experience or level of sophistication. A business also can make multiple offerings 
under Rule 504 as long as it waits at least six months between them; however, Rule 504 places a 
cap of $1 million in a 12-month period on the amount of capital a company can raise.
An offering under Rule 505 has a higher capital ceiling ($5 million in a 12-month period) 
than Rule 504 but imposes more restrictions (no more than 35 nonaccredited investors, no adver-
tising of the offer, and more stringent disclosure requirements).
Rule 506 imposes no ceiling on the amount that can be raised, but most companies that 
make Rule 506 offerings raise between $1 million and $50 million in capital. Like a Rule 505 
offering, it limits the issue to no more than 35 nonaccredited investors and prohibits advertising 
the offer to the public. There is no limit on the number of accredited investors, however. Rule 
506 also requires detailed disclosure of relevant information, but the extent depends on the size 
of the offering.

CHAPTER 13 • SOURCES OF FINANCING: EQUITY AND DEBT
517
Sources of Debt Financing
Debt financing involves the funds that the small business owner borrows and must repay with
interest. Debt financing is a popular tool that many entrepreneurs use to acquire capital. In a typi-
cal year, small businesses borrow about $1 trillion.60 Lenders of capital are more numerous than 
investors, although small business loans can be just as difficult (if not more difficult) to obtain.
According to the National Small Business Association, 35 percent of small business owners say
they are unable to obtain adequate financing for their companies.61
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Vicky Vij: Bukhara Grill Vicky Vij, an immigrant from 
Delhi, India, built a successful restaurant called Bukhara Grill in downtown New York City.
Y
The restaurant had sales of more than $2.5 million a year, three straight years of profitability, and
excellent credit. However, when Vij decided to buy a catering business to expand the operation,
he had no success getting funding from local banks. Vij turned to an online service, Biz2Credit
.com, which was able to find a bank in Salt Lake City that was willing to give his business an SBA-
guaranteed loan for $3.9 million to purchase a banquet hall and equipment.62 ■
Although borrowed capital allows entrepreneurs to maintain complete ownership of their 
businesses, it must be carried as a liability on the balance sheet as well as be repaid with interest 
at some point in the future. In addition, because small businesses are considered to be greater risks 
than bigger corporate customers, they must pay higher interest rates because of the risk–return 
–
trade-off—the higher the risk, the greater is the return demanded. Most small firms pay well above
the prime rate, the interest rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers. A study by 
David Walker, a professor at Georgetown University, reports that small businesses pay two to 
three times the prime rate, primarily because they rely heavily on credit cards and other high-cost 
methods of debt financing.63 Still, the cost of debt financing often is lower than that of equity 
financing. Because of the higher risks associated with providing equity capital to small compa-
nies, investors demand greater returns than lenders. In addition, unlike equity financing, debt 
financing does not require an entrepreneur to dilute his or her ownership interest in the company.
Entrepreneurs seeking debt capital are quickly confronted with an astounding range of credit 
options varying greatly in complexity, availability, and flexibility. Not all of these sources of debt 
capital are equally favorable, however. By understanding the various sources of debt capital and 
their characteristics, entrepreneurs can greatly increase the chances of obtaining a loan.
Figure 13.7 shows the financing strategies that existing small businesses use. We now turn to 
the various sources of debt capital.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Commercial Banks
Commercial banks are the very heart of the financial market for small businesses, providing the 
greatest number and variety of loans to small companies. Currently, outstanding small business
bank loans total $587.8 billion.64 For small business owners, banks are lenders of first resort. The
t
average microbusiness bank loan (those less than $100,000) is $6,377, and the average small
business bank loan (those between $100,000 and $1 million) is $240,428.65
Banks tend to be conservative in their lending practices and prefer to make loans to estab-
lished small businesses rather than to high-risk start-ups. Unfortunately for entrepreneurs, turbu-
lence in the financial markets has caused banks to tighten their lending standards, making it more 
difficult for small businesses, even established ones, to qualify for loans.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jeff Goldstein: AcuPOLL Research Even though Jeff 
Goldstein had a successful track record as a corporate brand manager and consultant, he 
had a difficult time finding a bank that would lend him the money to buy an existing market re-
search company called AcuPOLL Research. Ten banks turned him down, even though he was seek-
ing a loan with a 75% guarantee from the U.S. Small Business Administration. Eventually, Goldstein 
was able to find a bank that would fund his purchase of AcuPOLL Research.66 ■
Because start-up companies are so risky, bankers prefer to make loans to existing businesses
with successful track records. They are concerned with a firm’s operating past and will scrutinize 
its financial reports to project its position in the future. They also want proof of the stability of the 
company’s sales and its ability to generate adequate cash flow to repay the loan. If they do make 
loans to a start-up venture, banks like to see sufficient cash flow to repay the loan, ample collat-
eral to secure it, or an SBA guarantee to insure it. Small banks are more likely than large banks 
to extend loans to small businesses. Small banks also tend to be “small business friendly” and are 
more likely than their larger counterparts to customize the terms of their loans to the particular 
needs of small businesses, offering, for example, flexible payment terms to match the seasonal 
pattern of a company’s cash flow or interest-only payments until a piece of equipment begins 
generating revenue. Small and midsize banks approve 45 percent of small business loan requests,
but large banks approve only 10 percent of loan requests from small companies.67
When evaluating a loan application, especially for a business start-up, banks focus on a com-
pany’s capacity to create positive cash flow because they know that is where the money to repay 
their loans will come from. The ability of the business to comfortably repay the loan, both inter-
est and principal, is the first source of payment bankers want to see. The first question in most 
bankers’ minds when reviewing an entrepreneur’s business plan is, “Can this business generate 
sufficient cash to repay the loan?”
Bankers look to business owners as the second source of repayment if a company is not able
to repay a small business loan. Banks and other lenders also require entrepreneurs to sign personal 
guarantees for any loan they make to small businesses. By making a personal loan guarantee, an 
entrepreneur is pledging that he or she will be liable personally for repaying the loan in the event 
that the business itself cannot repay the loan. Recall from Chapter 6 that in the eyes of the law, 
a sole proprietor or a general partner and the business are one and the same; therefore, for them, 
personal loan guarantees are redundant. However, because the owners of S corporations, corpora-
tions, and LLCs are separate from their businesses, they are not automatically responsible for the
company’s debts. Once the owners of these businesses sign a personal loan guarantee, however,
they become liable for their companies’ loans. It is as if these individuals have “cosigned” the 
loan with the business, not unlike many parents must cosign loans for their young adult children.
Even though bankers rely on collateral to secure their loans, the last thing banks want is for 
a borrower to default, forcing them to sell the collateral (often at “fire-sale” prices) and use the
proceeds to pay off the loan. Therefore, collateral is actually the third source of repayment bank-
ers look to for repayment of a small business loan. That’s why bankers stress cash flow when
analyzing a loan request and demand personal guarantees from the entrepreneurs.
Short-Term Loans
Short-term loans, extended for less than one year, are the most common type of commercial loan 
banks make to small companies. These funds typically are used to replenish the working capital 
account to finance the purchase of inventory, boost output, finance credit sales to customers, or 

CHAPTER 13 • SOURCES OF FINANCING: EQUITY AND DEBT
519
take advantage of cash discounts. As a result, an entrepreneur repays the loan after converting 
inventory and receivables into cash. There are several types of short-term loans.
HOME EQUITY LOANS Many entrepreneurs use the equity that they have built in their homes to 
finance their business start-ups. Entrepreneurs borrow from themselves by pledging their homes
as collateral for the loans they receive. However, declining real estate values in most parts of 
the country have reduced or wiped out the equity in many people’s homes, making securing
home equity loans for their businesses much more difficult. Brother and sister Russell and Julia 
Lundstrom funded their start-up Simple Smart Science, which produces cognitive and memory 
nutritional products, with a $125,000 home equity loan from a community bank.68
COMMERCIAL LOANS (OR “TRADITIONAL BANK LOANS”) A basic short-term loan is the commercial 
bank’s specialty. Business owners typically repay the loan, which often is unsecured because
secured loans are much more expensive to administer and maintain, as a lump sum within three to 
six months. In other words, the bank grants a loan to a business owner without requiring him or 
her to pledge any specific collateral to support the loan in case of default. The owner repays the 
total amount of the loan at maturity. Sometimes the interest due on the loan is prepaid—deducted 
from the total amount borrowed. Until business owners can prove their companies’ creditworthiness 
to the bank’s satisfaction, they are not likely to qualify for unsecured commercial loans.
LINES OF CREDIT One of the most common requests entrepreneurs make of banks and commercial 
finance companies is to establish a commercial line of credit, a short-term loan with a preset 
limit that provides much-needed cash flow for day-to-day operations. A line of credit is ideal for 
helping business owners smooth out the uneven flow of cash that results from seasonal sales, funding 
inventory purchases, extending trade credit, and smoothing out fluctuations in a business’s working
capital. With a commercial line of credit, a business owner can borrow up to the predetermined 
ceiling at any time during the year by quickly and conveniently drawing down on the line of 
credit. Bankers often require a company to rest its line of credit during the year, maintaining a zero 
balance, as proof that the line of credit is not a perpetual crutch. Like commercial loans, lines of 
credit can be secured or unsecured but normally require a personal guarantee. In a recent NFIB 
survey, 54 percent of small business owners who applied for a new line of credit received one.69
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jordan Drake When Jordan Drake was approved to open
a State Farm Insurance agency in Hendersonville, Tennessee, he knew that he would need 
additional financing to supplement the personal savings he was using to start his new business. 
Drake was able to get a $25,000 line of credit through his local bank by securing the loan with his 
personal pickup truck. State Farm provided an additional $25,000 unsecured line of credit. Fortu-
nately, through careful negotiation of his lease and prudent cash management, Drake was able to 
open the business without drawing on either line of credit. However, he says he sleeps easier know-
ing he has access to additional funding if his start-up hits any bumps in the road.70 ■
FLOOR PLANNING Floor planning is a form of financing frequently employed by retailers of 
“big-ticket items” that are easily distinguishable from one another (usually by serial number), 
such as automobiles, boats, and major appliances. For example, a commercial bank finances 
Auto City’s purchase of its inventory of automobiles and maintains a security interest in each 
car in the order by holding its title as collateral. Auto City pays interest on the loan monthly 
and repays the principal as it sells the cars. The longer a floor-planned item sits in inventory, 
the more it costs the business owner in interest expense. Banks and other floor planners often 
discourage retailers from using their money without authorization by performing spot checks to
verify prompt repayment of the principal as items are sold.
Intermediate- and Long-Term Loans
Banks are primarily lenders of short-term capital to small businesses, although they will make
intermediate- and long-term loans. Intermediate- and long-term loans, which are normally se-
cured by collateral, are extended for one year or longer. Commercial banks grant these loans for 
constructing buildings, purchasing real estate and equipment, expanding a business, and other 
long-term investments. Matching the amount and the purpose of a loan to the appropriate type 
and length of loan is important. Loan repayments are normally made monthly or quarterly.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
INSTALLMENT LOANS One of the most common types of intermediate-term loans is an installment 
loan, which banks make to small firms for purchasing equipment, facilities, real estate, and other 
fixed assets. When financing equipment, a bank usually lends the small business from 60 to
80 percent of the equipment’s value in return for a security interest in the equipment. The loan’s 
amortization schedule, which is based on a set number of monthly payments, typically coincides 
with the length of the equipment’s usable life. In financing real estate (commercial mortgages), 
banks typically lend up to 75 to 80 percent of the property’s value and allow a lengthier repayment 
schedule of 10 to 30 years.
Landing a loan to start or expand a small business is much more
difficult today than in the past because of stodgy credit markets
and upheaval in the banking and financial industries. Entrepre-
neurs often complain that bankers don’t understand the financial 
needs they face when starting and operating their businesses. In 
many instances, however, business owners fail to help themselves 
when they apply for bank loans. Following are the seven most 
common reasons bankers reject small business loan applications—
and how you can avoid them.
Reason 1. “Our bank doesn’t make small business 
loans.”
Cure: Select the right bank. Before applying for a bank loan, 
research banks to find out which ones actively seek the type
of loan you need. Some banks don’t make loans of less than
$500,000, whereas others focus almost exclusively on small 
company loans. The SBA’s reports Micro-Business-Friendly 
Banks in the United States and Small Business Lending in the 
United States are valuable resources for locating the banks in 
your area that are most likely to make small business loans.
Small, local banks tend to be more receptive to small business
loan requests than many large banks, which often rely on 
formulas and templates to make lending decisions. Other 
factors that influence the types of loans that banks make 
include the industry in which the company competes, the
company’s geographic location, and the length of time it has 
been in business. Establishing a relationship with a bank before 
you need a loan also increases the probability that your loan
request will be successful. Once you find the right bank for your 
business, open an account there, seek a small line of credit, and
repay it consistently.
Reason 2. “I don’t know enough about you or 
your business.”
Cure: Although a business plan that explains what your 
company does (or will do) is a good first step, develop a 
personal relationship with the banker so he or she gets to 
know you better and hears about your business from your 
perspective. If you already have a physical location for your
business, try to get the banker to meet with you there. If not, 
try to find a neutral location that gets the banker out of his or 
her office. Make sure you have your “elevator pitch” honed,
as it creates the first impression of you and your business. You
should be able to describe your business—what it does, sells,
or makes and its competitive edge—in just one or two minutes. 
Your business plan should address why there is an opportunity
in the market, your company’s major competition, what it will 
take to succeed in the market, and how your business will
gain a competitive advantage in the market. Keep your plan
focused and concise. Do not fill it up with operational details. 
In addition, be prepared to supply multiple scenarios of your
financial projections, business credit references, and a personal
credit history.
Reason 3. “You haven’t told me why you need the 
money.”
Cure: A solid business plan with clear financial forecasts and 
budgets will explain how much money you need and how 
you plan to use it. Make sure your request is specific; avoid 
requests for loans “for working capital.” Don’t make the 
mistake of answering the question “How much money do 
you need?” with “How much will you lend me?” Also, don’t
just throw out a rough number without any rationale or 
justification. If a banker thinks you are just guessing on your 
financing needs, the conversation will be over immediately. 
Instead, know how much money you need and be able to
explain how the money will benefit your business and get
it profitable enough to easily repay the loan. Remember
that bankers want to make loans (after all, that’s how they 
generate a profit), but they want to make loans only to
those people they believe will repay them. Their primary 
responsibility is to protect the money that all of us entrust with 
them in our checking and savings accounts.
Reason 4. “Your numbers don’t support your loan 
request.”
Cure: Include a cash flow forecast in your business plan. Bankers 
analyze a company’s balance sheet and income statement to 
judge the quality of its assets and its profitability, but they lend 
primarily on the basis of cash flow. “Can you repay the loan

balance?” is the question that most concerns bankers, and 
they know that repaying a loan requires adequate cash flow.
Collateral that backs up the loan is their last form of repayment, 
so do not stress collateral in your presentation—stress cash flow! 
If your business does not generate adequate cash flow, don’t 
expect to get a loan. Prove to the banker that you understand 
your company’s cash flow and how to manage it properly.
As a measure of a company’s ability to repay a loan, bank-
ers calculate the company’s cash coverage ratio, which is its net
income plus its noncash expenses (such as depreciation and 
amortization) divided by the annual payments on the proposed 
loan. They want to see a cash coverage ratio of at least 1.5:1 
before granting a loan. In other words, to support $100,000 of 
loan payments, a company should have net cash flow of at least 
$150,000.
Reason 5. “You don’t have enough collateral.”
Cure: Be prepared to pledge your company’s assets—and your 
personal assets—as collateral for the loan. If a company’s cash 
flow declines to the point that it cannot make loan payments, 
banks look for other ways to get their money back. To protect 
themselves in a worst-case scenario (a business that is unable 
to repay a loan), bankers want the security of collateral before 
they make a loan. They will look to your personal assets first 
through your personal guarantee. They also expect more than 
$1 in collateral for every $1 of money they lend a business. Banks 
typically lend 50 to 90 percent of the value of real estate, 50 to 
80 percent of the value of accounts receivable, and just 10 to 
50 percent of the value of inventory and equipment pledged as 
collateral.
Reason 6. “Your business does not support the 
loan on its own.”
Cure: Be prepared to provide a personal guarantee on the 
loan. This is a given for most small business loans until the
company has a history of strong financial performance. By 
giving a personal guarantee, you’re telling the banker that if
your business cannot repay the loan, you will. Many bankers see 
their small business clients and their companies as one and the 
same. Even if you choose a form of ownership that provides you 
with limited personal liability, bankers will ask you to override 
that protection by personally guaranteeing the loan. Another 
way to lower the risk of a bank extending a loan to a small 
company is to secure a loan guarantee through one of the 
SBA’s programs.
Reason 7: “You don’t have enough ‘skin’ in 
the game.”
Cure: Increase the amount of money you have invested in the 
project. A few years ago, entrepreneurs were able to get loans 
for projects by investing as little as 5 to 10 percent of the total 
amount. Today, depending on the project, bankers expect 
entrepreneurs to put up at least 20 to 25 percent of the project’s 
cost—and sometimes much more. Be prepared to use your 
company’s retained earnings to pay for a significant portion of 
the cost of a project.
David Pitts, owner of Classic Graphics, a printing company
in Charlotte, North Carolina, knows firsthand how the small busi-
ness lending environment has changed. In the company’s 30-year
history, Pitts has relied on many bank loans to finance the com-
pany’s growth. Recently, however, securing bank loans has been
much more difficult despite Classic Graphics’ rapid growth (from 
$39 million in sales to $50 million in sales in just one year) and 
strong financial performance. Securing several loans that ranged 
from $200,000 to more than $1 million became much more dif-
ficult than in the past, says Pitts. Although Pitts took realistic 
financial projections and a strong business plan to banks, several
bankers rejected his loan requests for Classic Graphics.
There’s no magic to getting a bank to approve your loan re-
quest. The secret is proper preparation and building a solid busi-
ness plan that helps explain your business model and builds your 
credibility with the banker as a reliable business owner.

Hands On . . . How To (continued)
TERM LOANS Another common type of loan banks make to small businesses is a term loan.
Typically unsecured, banks grant these loans to businesses whose past operating history suggests 
a high probability of repayment. Some banks make only secured term loans, however. Term 
loans impose restrictions (called covenants) on the business decisions an entrepreneur makes
concerning the company’s operations. For instance, a term loan may set limits on owners’ 
salaries, prohibit further borrowing without the bank’s approval, or require maintaining certain 
financial ratios (recall the discussion of ratio analysis in Chapter 11).
The accompanying “Hands On . . . How To” feature describes the seven most common rea-
sons bankers reject small business loan applications and how to avoid them.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
The Small Business Administration (SBA)  
Loan Guarantee Programs
The SBA works with local lenders (both bank and nonbank) to offer many other loan programs 
that are designed to help entrepreneurs who cannot get capital from traditional sources gain ac-
cess to the financing they need to launch and grow their businesses. When they were just small 
companies, Callaway Golf, Outback Steakhouse, and Intel Corporation borrowed through the 
SBA’s loan programs. The SBA has several programs designed to help finance both start-up and 
existing small companies that cannot qualify for traditional loans because of their thin asset base 
and their higher risk of failure. The SBA guarantees more than 52,000 small business loans total-
ing more than $19 billion each year, which enable many entrepreneurs to get the financing they 
need for start-up or for growth. In the wake of the upheaval in the financial markets, banks have 
tightened their lending standards, and many small businesses cannot qualify for loans.
SBA loan programs are aimed at entrepreneurs who do not meet lending standards at 
conventional lending institutions. About 30 percent of SBA-backed loans go to start-up
companies.71 The SBA does not actually lend money to entrepreneurs directly; instead, en-
trepreneurs borrow money from a traditional lender, and the SBA guarantees repayment of 
a percentage of the loan (at least 50 percent and sometimes as much as 85 percent) in case the 
borrower defaults. The loan application process can take from three days to several months, de-
pending on how well prepared the entrepreneur is and which bank or lender is involved.
Qualifying for an SBA loan guarantee requires cooperation among the entrepreneur, the 
participating lender, and the SBA. The participating lender determines the loan’s terms and sets 
the interest rate within SBA limits. Contrary to popular belief, SBA-guaranteed loans do not
carry special deals on interest rates. The average interest rate on SBA-guaranteed loans is prime-
plus-2 percent (compared to prime-plus-1 percent on conventional bank loans).
The average duration of an SBA loan is 12 years—far longer than the average commercial 
small business loan. In fact, longer loan terms are a distinct advantage of SBA loans. At least half 
of all bank business loans are for less than one year. By contrast, SBA real estate loans can extend 
for up to 25 years (compared to just 10 to 15 years for a conventional loan), and working capital 
loans have maturities of seven years (compared with two to five years at most banks). These 
longer terms translate into lower loan payments, which are better suited for young, fast-growing, 
cash-strapped companies.
Because SBA-guaranteed loans are riskier, their default rate is higher than that of standard
bank loans. Because the SBA assumes most of the credit risk, lenders are more willing to con-
sider riskier deals that they normally would refuse. With the SBA’s guarantee, borrowers also
have to come up with less collateral than with a traditional bank loan.
The SBA offers several loan programs, which are summarized in the following sections. 
Table 13.1 displays a summary of the most popular SBA loan programs.
7(A) LOAN GUARANTY PROGRAM The 7(a) loan guaranty program is the SBA’s flagship loan
program (see Figure 13.8 on page 525). More than 3,500 private lenders in the United States 
make SBA loans to small businesses, but the SBA guarantees them (85 percent of loans up to
$150,000 and 75 percent of loans that range from $150,001 up to the loan cap of $3.75 million for 
7(a) loans). The average 7(a) loan is $344,520.72 A 7(a) loan is a term loan that business owners 
can use for expansion, renovation, new construction, purchasing land or buildings, purchasing 
equipment, working capital, a seasonal line of credit, inventory, or starting a business.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Dennis Clem: Clem’s Service Station Dennis Clem 
learned about the business of running a service station from his father, and Clem is teach-
ing his own son what he will need to know to run the family business some day. In 2010, Clem 
decided he would buy out his siblings who also had inherited a share in the business to allow him 
to pass the business on to his son when he was ready to retire. All of the siblings agreed because 
Dennis was the only family member who worked in the service station. The Clem family had never 
used credit to fund the growth of the business. Each new expansion was funded by the company’s
retained earnings. However, buying out his siblings would require more cash than the business
could generate. Clem was able to secure an SBA guaranteed loan through the 7(a) loan program 
from his local bank.73 ■

The Automobile Film Club of America
Ralph Lucci, owner of The Automobile Film Club of America in
Stapleton, New York, operated a true niche market business. 
Lucci’s business rented vintage and specialty cars for use in mov-
ies and television shows filmed in the New York City area. The 
Automobile Film Club of America had been operating since 1993.
Although the business suffered in the aftermath of 9/11, it survived 
that setback, and Lucci was able to rebuild the company as film
and television production returned to New York.
At its peak, the business grew to 14 full-time employees who 
helped support the more than 300 cars the company rented for 
film and television productions. However, over the next few years 
the business faced more challenges. The company lost the lease 
on the lot it used to store the cars, and Lucci could not find a lot
large enough to keep his entire inventory, forcing him to sell off 
many of the cars. Revenues declined, and soon the business could
support only him and his wife on the payroll. When hurricane 
Irene hit in 2011, the company took another financial hit due to
damage to its property and lost business.
However, the worst was yet to come.
When hurricane Sandy hit in October 2012, the storm surge 
flooded his car lot and garage, completely submerging almost all 
of his cars in salt water. The cars and much of his equipment were 
a total loss. The building he used for offices and car maintenance 
also was severely damaged by the flooding. He estimated that the
total loss was more than $400,000. The only insurance he carried
on the business was for liability, so there was no coverage for his
lost property.
Lucci, who is 60 years old, must decide whether he is willing 
to use his personal assets, including his home, as collateral and 
attempt to secure a business loan to restart his company.
Eatwhatever
Jacqui Rosshandler, an Australian ex-pat working for an interior 
design company in New York City, wanted to start a business
and leave her corporate career. She had noticed that a popular
breath-freshening product sold in Australia was not available in 
the United States. The product was a gel cap made from meat 
byproducts, but Rosshandler decided to make her product from
organic peppermint oil and parsley seed oil. Much of the source 
of bad breath is in the stomach, not the mouth, so the gel caps 
were very effective. However, she knew that American consumers 
were used to sucking on breath mints. She decided that she would 
package the gel cap with a breath mint, so consumers could suck 
on the mint after swallowing the gel cap. She would market her
product as Eatwhatever.
Rosshandler outsourced product formulation and production
to a contract manufacturer. She hired a packaging designer to cre-
ate a package that displayed the product in a clear and attractive 
way. Eatwhatever is marketed as “2 Steps to Kissable Breath.”
Although customers loved her product, she had a difficult 
time getting contracts with large retailers. She had success selling
online and in specialty shops, but it was not enough to fund the
growth of the company. Cash was tight. In fact, cash was so tight 
that she did not have enough to pay for marketing or for a new
production run.
Rosshandler met Arthur T. Shorin, an angel investor and 
former CEO in the candy industry. Shorin liked the product and 
offered to invest $250,000, connect Rosshandler with people he 
knew in the industry, and give her a salary on top of the invest-
ment in the company. In return, he would take 75 percent owner-r
ship in the business. Rosshandler could earn back 15 percent of
the company if revenues met certain targets. Although her friends 
urged her not to accept his terms, she was concerned that her
business would not succeed unless it got the cash and connec-
tions Shorin offered her.

certified development company (CDC), which is a nonprofit organization licensed by the SBA 
and designed to promote economic growth in local communities. Some 270 CDCs operate across 
the United States and make about 8,000 loans in a typical year. The entrepreneur is required to 
make a down payment of just 10 percent of the total project cost rather than the typical 20 to 
30 percent traditional bank loans require. The CDC provides 40 percent at a long-term fixed rate, 
supported by an SBA loan guarantee in case the entrepreneur defaults. The bank provides long-
term financing for the remaining 50 percent, also supported by an SBA guarantee. The major 
advantages of Section 504 loans are their fixed rates and terms, their 10- and 20-year maturities, 
and the low down payment required. The maximum loan amount that the SBA will guarantee is 
$5 million, and the average Section 504 loan is $714,000.74
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Joe and Joyce Spatafore: Cubby’s Child Care Center
Due to its success in attracting an ever-expanding group of families, Cubby’s Child Care 
Center, located in Bridgeport, West Virginia, needed a larger building. Joe and Joyce Spatafore,
Cubby’s owners, were able to find a location to construct a new 18,000 square foot building to 
house their growing business. The Spatafores used the SBA’s 504 Certified Development Company
loan program to help finance the project through their local bank. The new space allowed Cubby’s
to double its enrollment from 150 to 300 children. With the added capacity, Cubby’s also increased
employment by adding 15 new jobs.75 ■
MICROLOAN PROGRAM About three-fourths of all entrepreneurs need less than $100,000 to launch 
their businesses. Indeed, most entrepreneurs require less than $50,000 to start their companies.
Unfortunately, loans of that amount can be the most difficult to get. Lending these relatively small 
amounts to entrepreneurs starting businesses is the purpose of the SBA’s Microloan Program.
Called microloans because they range from just $100 to as much as $50,000, these loans have
helped thousands of people take their first steps toward entrepreneurship. Banks typically shun 
loans in such small amounts because they consider them to be risky and unprofitable. In an attempt 
to fill the void in small loans to start-up companies, the SBA launched the microloan program 
in 1992, and it has gone on to become the single largest source of funding for microenterprises. 
Today, nearly 180 authorized lenders make SBA-backed microloans. The average size of 
a microloan is $13,000, with a maturity of three years (the maximum term is six years) and 
maximum interest rates that typically are between 8 and 13 percent. Microloans do not carry SBA 
guarantees, but lenders’ standards are less demanding than those on conventional loans. In fact, 
37 percent of all microloans go to business start-ups, and more than half of all microloans go to 
women- and minority-owned businesses.76 A recent survey found that 54 percent of all start-up
microbusiness owners rely on another job as their main source of income.77 All microloans are
made through nonprofit intermediaries that are approved by the SBA. Entrepreneurs can find a 
listing of microloan intermediaries at the SBA’s Web site.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Cary and Meryl Gabeler: Anjolie Ayurveda Cary 
Gabeler and her daughter Meryl had learned the holistic aromatherapy practice, called 
Ayurvedic, when visiting India. The mother and daughter partners opened their business, Anjolie 
Ayurveda, in Hastings-On-Hudson, New York, to bring Ayurvedic therapy to the United States by
Y
importing handmade skincare products from a women-owned and -operated facility in India. The 
Gabelers participated in a 60-hour entrepreneurship education program sponsored by the Women’s 
Enterprise Development Center in White Plains, New York. After completing the program, they 
Y
received an $18,000 SBA microloan to launch a new line of Ayurvedic perfumes made in the United 
States to expand their inventory and increase their product line.78 ■
Other SBA Loan Programs
SBAEXPRESS PROGRAM To reduce the paperwork requirements and processing time involved in 
its loans, the SBA offers its SBAExpress program that gives entrepreneurs responses to their loan
applications within 36 hours. In the SBAExpress Program, participating lenders use their own 
loan procedures and applications to make loans of up to $350,000 to small businesses. Because 
the SBA guarantees 50 percent of the loan, banks often are willing to make smaller loans to 
entrepreneurs who might otherwise have difficulty meeting lenders’ standards. Entrepreneurs can 
use these flexible term loans for a variety of business purposes, such as purchasing equipment,
fixtures, land, or buildings; renovating existing structures or building new ones; buying inventory; 
and obtaining a seasonal line of credit. Loan maturities on SBAExpress loans typically are between 
5 and 10 years, but loan maturities for fixed assets can be up to 25 years.
SMALL LOAN ADVANTAGE AND COMMUNITY ADVANTAGE LOAN PROGRAMS In 2011, the SBA
introduced two new loan programs, the Small Loan Advantage and the Community Advantage 
programs. The Small Loan Advantage program is designed to encourage existing, experienced
SBA lenders, known as preferred lenders, to make smaller loans, which are most likely to benefit 
disadvantaged borrowers. The Community Advantage Loan program encourages new lenders 
that operate in economically challenged communities that have had little or no access to SBA 
loans to enter the SBA’s 7(a) loan program. Both programs include SBA guarantees of 85 percent 
on loans up to $150,000 and 75 percent on loans between $150,001 and the ceiling of $250,000 
and use a streamlined application process.
THE CAPLINE PROGRAM In addition to its basic 7(a) loan guarantee program (through which
the SBA makes about 75 percent of its loans), the SBA provides guarantees on small business
loans for start-up, real estate, machinery and equipment, fixtures, working capital, exporting,
and restructuring debt through several other methods. About two-thirds of all of the SBA’s loan
guarantees are for machinery and equipment or working capital. The CAPLine Program offers 
short-term capital to growing companies seeking to finance seasonal buildups in inventory or 
accounts receivable under five separate programs, each with maturities up to five years: seasonal 
line of credit (provides advances against inventory and accounts receivable to help businesses 
weather seasonal sales fluctuations), contract line of credit (finances the cost of direct labor 
and materials costs associated with performing contracts), builder’s line of credit (helps small
contractors and builders finance labor and materials costs), standard asset-based line of credit (an
asset-based revolving line of credit for financing short-term needs), and small asset-based line of 
credit. CAPLine helps cash-hungry small businesses by giving them a credit line to draw on when 
they need it. A line of credit is what many small companies need most because they are flexible, 
efficient, and, unfortunately, quite difficult for small businesses to get from traditional lenders.
LOANS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TRADE For small businesses going global, the SBA has
the Export Express Program, which, like its other express programs, offers quick turnaround 
times on applications for guarantees of 75 to 90 percent on loans up to $500,000 to help small 
companies develop or expand their export initiatives. Loan maturities range from 5 to 25 years.
The SBA also offers the Export Working Capital (EWC) Program, which is designed
to provide working capital to small exporters. The SBA works in conjunction with the Export-
Import Bank to administer this loan guarantee program. Applicants file a one-page loan applica-
tion, and the response time normally is 10 days or less. The maximum loan is $5 million with a 
90 percent guarantee, and proceeds must be used to finance small business exports.

527
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Brenda Marrero Brenda Marrero launched her staffing 
business after being laid off by a large, multinational corporation. She grew Brenda 
Marrero & Associates into a leader in its industry. Marrero had started the business in Puerto Rico, 
but soon saw opportunity to expand the executive staffing business into other markets. The first 
new markets were the Dominican Republic and Peru. When Marrero wanted to expand into Costa
Rica, Panama, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada, she needed additional financing. Marrero
was able to secure an Export Express SBA loan through her local bank in Puerto Rico.79 ■
The International Trade Program is for small businesses that are engaging in international
trade or are adversely affected by competition from imports. The SBA allows global entrepre-
neurs to combine loans from the Export Working Capital Program with those from International
Trade Program for up to $5 million with a maximum guarantee of $4.5 million. Loan maturities
range from 1 to 25 years.
DISASTER LOANS As their name implies, disaster loans are made to small businesses devastated
by some kind of financial or physical losses from hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, and 
other natural disasters. The maximum disaster loan usually is $2 million, but Congress often raises
that ceiling when circumstances warrant. Disaster loans carry below-market interest rates as low 
as 4 percent and terms as long as 30 years. Loans for physical damage above $14,000 require
an entrepreneur to pledge some kind of collateral, usually a lien on the business property. In the 
aftermath of hurricane-force Santa Ana winds in California that damaged or destroyed many
small businesses, the SBA approved disaster loans at just 4 percent interest to help entrepreneurs 
get their companies back up and running.80
Nonbank Sources of Debt Capital
Although they usually are the first stop for entrepreneurs in search of debt capital, banks are not 
the only lending game in town. We now turn our attention to other sources of debt capital that 
entrepreneurs can tap to feed their cash-hungry companies.
ASSET-BASED LENDERS Across the United States, nearly 3,400 asset-based lenders, which are 
usually smaller commercial banks, commercial finance companies, specialty lenders, or divisions
of bank holding companies that allow small businesses to borrow money by pledging otherwise 
idle assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, or purchase orders, as collateral. This method
of financing works especially well for manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and other 
companies that have significant stocks of inventory or accounts receivable. Asset-based borrowing
is an efficient method of borrowing because business owners borrow only the money they need 
when they need it. Even unprofitable companies whose financial statements cannot convince loan
officers to make traditional loans often can get asset-based loans. These cash-poor but asset-rich 
companies can use normally unproductive assets—accounts receivable, inventory, and purchase 
orders—to finance rapid growth and the cash crises that often accompany it.
Like banks, asset-based lenders consider a company’s cash flow, but they are more interested
in the quality of the assets pledged as collateral. The amount a small business can borrow through 
asset-based lending depends on the advance rate, the percentage of an asset’s value that a lender 
will lend. For example, a company pledging $100,000 of accounts receivable might negotiate a 
70 percent advance rate and qualify for a $70,000 asset-based loan. Advance rates can vary dra-
matically depending on the quality of the assets pledged and the lender. Because inventory is an 
illiquid asset (i.e., hard to sell), the advance rate on inventory-based loans is quite low, usually
10 to 50 percent. A business pledging high-quality accounts receivable as collateral, however, 
may be able to negotiate up to an 85 percent advance rate. The most common types of asset-based 
financing are discounting accounts receivable, inventory financing, and purchase order financing.
Discounting Accounts Receivable The most common form of secured credit is accounts-receivable 
financing. Under this arrangement, a small business pledges its accounts receivable as collateral; in
return, the lender advances a loan against the value of approved accounts receivable. The amount 
of the loan tendered is not equal to the face value of the accounts receivable, however. Even 
though the lender screens the firm’s accounts and accepts only qualified receivables, it makes an
allowance for the risk involved because it will have to write off some of them as uncollectible.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
A small business usually can borrow an amount equal to 55 to 85 percent of its receivables, 
depending on their quality. Generally, lenders do not accept receivables that are past due.
Inventory Financing With inventory financing, a small business loan is secured by its inventory 
of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. If an owner defaults on the loan, the lender 
can claim the pledged inventory, sell it, and use the proceeds to satisfy the loan (assuming that 
the bank’s claim is superior to the claims of other creditors). Because inventory usually is not 
a highly liquid asset and its value can be difficult to determine, lenders are willing to lend only 
a portion of its worth, usually no more than 50 percent of the inventory’s value. Most asset-
based lenders avoid inventory-only deals; they prefer to make loans backed by inventory and
more secure accounts receivable. The key to qualifying for inventory financing is proving that 
a company has a plan or a process in place to ensure that the inventory securing the loan sells 
quickly. To ensure the quality of the assets supporting the loans they make, lenders must monitor 
borrowers’ assets, a task that increases the paperwork requirements on these loans.
Purchase Order Financing Small companies that receive orders from large customers can use 
those purchase orders as collateral for loans. The customer places an order with a small business,
which needs financing to fill the order. The small company pledges the future payment from
the customer as security for the loan, and the lender verifies the credit rating of the customer 
(not the small business) before granting the short-term loan, which often carries interest rates of 
40 percent or more. Borrowers usually repay the loan within 60 days.
Asset-based loans are more expensive than traditional bank loans because of the cost of 
originating and maintaining them and the higher risk they involve. Rates usually run from 2 to 
7 percent (or more) above the prime rate. Because of this rate differential, small business owners 
should not use asset-based loans for long-term financing; their goal should be to establish their 
credit through asset-based financing and then to move up to a line of credit.
VENDOR FINANCING Many small companies borrow money from their vendors and suppliers in 
the form of trade credit. Because of its ready availability, trade credit is an extremely important 
source of financing to most entrepreneurs. When banks refuse to lend money to a start-up business 
because they see it as a high credit risk, an entrepreneur may be able to turn to trade credit for 
capital. Getting vendors to extend credit in the form of delayed payments (e.g., “net 30” credit 
terms) usually is much easier for small businesses than obtaining bank financing. Essentially, 
a company receiving trade credit from a supplier is getting a short-term, interest-free loan for 
the amount of the goods purchased. Vendors and suppliers often are willing to finance a small 
business’s purchases of goods from 30 to 60 days (sometimes longer), interest free.
EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS Most equipment vendors encourage business owners to purchase their 
equipment by offering to finance the purchase. This method of financing is similar to trade credit 
but with slightly different terms. Equipment vendors offer reasonable credit terms with only a
modest down payment, with the balance financed over the life of the equipment (often several
years). In some cases, the vendor will repurchase equipment for salvage value at the end of its 
useful life and offer the business owner another credit agreement on new equipment. Start-up
companies often use trade credit from equipment suppliers to purchase equipment and fixtures 
such as display cases, refrigeration units, and machinery. It pays to scrutinize vendors’ credit 
terms, however, because they may be less attractive than those of other lenders.
COMMERCIAL FINANCE COMPANIES When denied bank loans, small business owners often look 
to commercial finance companies for the same types of loans. Commercial finance companies 
are second only to banks in making loans to small businesses, and, unlike their conservative
counterparts, they are willing to tolerate more risk in their loan portfolios. Of course, their 
primary consideration is collecting their loans, but finance companies tend to rely more on 
obtaining a security interest in some type of collateral, given the higher-risk loans that make up 
their portfolios. Because commercial finance companies depend on collateral to recover most of 
their losses, they are able to make loans to small companies with irregular cash flows or to those 
that are not yet profitable.
Approximately 150 large commercial finance companies, such as AT&T Small Business Lend-
ing, GE Capital Small Business Finance, and others, make a variety of loans to small companies,
ranging from asset-based loans and business leases to construction and SBA loans. Dubbed “the 

CHAPTER 13 • SOURCES OF FINANCING: EQUITY AND DEBT
529
Wal-Marts of finance,” commercial finance companies usually offer many of the same credit options 
as commercial banks do. Because their loans are subject to more risks, finance companies charge
a higher interest rate than commercial banks. Their most common methods of providing credit to 
small businesses are asset based—accounts-receivable financing and inventory loans. Rates on these 
loans vary but can be as high as 15 to 30 percent (including fees), depending on the risk a particular 
business presents and the quality of the assets involved. Because many of the loans they make are 
secured by collateral (if not accounts receivable or inventory, then the business equipment, vehicles, 
real estate, or inventory purchased with the loan), finance companies often impose more onerous 
reporting requirements, sometimes requiring weekly (or even daily) information on a small com-
pany’s inventory levels or accounts-receivable balances. However, entrepreneurs who cannot secure 
financing from traditional lenders because of their short track records, less-than-perfect credit rat-
ings, or fluctuating earnings often find the loans they need at commercial finance companies.
SAVINGS-AND-LOAN ASSOCIATIONS Savings-and-loan associations specialize in loans for real 
property. In addition to their traditional role of providing mortgages for personal residences,
savings-and-loan associations offer financing on commercial and industrial property. In the 
typical commercial or industrial loan, the savings-and-loan association will lend up to 80 percent 
of the property’s value with a repayment schedule of up to 30 years. Most savings-and-loan 
associations hesitate to lend money for buildings specially designed for a particular customer’s 
needs. They expect the mortgage to be repaid from the company’s future earnings.
STOCKBROKERS Stockbrokers also make loans, and many of the loans they make to their cus-
tomers carry lower interest rates than those from banks. These margin loans carry lower rates 
because the collateral supporting them—the stocks and bonds in the customer’s portfolio—is 
of high quality and is highly liquid. Moreover, brokerage firms make it easy to borrow. Brokers
often set up a line of credit for their customers when they open a brokerage account. To tap that 
line of credit, the customer simply writes a check or uses a debit card. Typically, there is no fixed
repayment schedule for a margin loan; the debt can remain outstanding indefinitely as long as 
the market value of the borrower’s portfolio of collateral meets minimum requirements. Aspiring
entrepreneurs can borrow up to 50 percent of the value of their stock portfolios, up to 70 percent 
of their bond portfolios, and up to 90 percent of the value of their government securities.
There is risk involved in using stocks and bonds as collateral on a loan. Brokers typically
require a 30 percent cushion on margin loans. If the value of the borrower’s portfolio drops, the 
broker can make a margin (maintenance) call; that is, the broker can call the loan and require 
the borrower to provide more cash and securities as collateral. Recent swings in the stock market 
have translated into margin calls for many entrepreneurs, requiring them to repay a significant 
portion of their loan balances within a matter of days—or hours. If an account lacks adequate 
collateral, the broker can sell off the customer’s portfolio to pay off the loan.
CREDIT UNIONS Credit unions, nonprofit financial cooperatives that promote saving and provide 
loans to their members, are best known for making consumer and car loans. However, many are also 
willing to lend money to their members to launch and operate businesses. More than 6,500 state-and
federally-chartered credit unions with 99 million members operate in the United States, and they 
make loans to their members totaling more than $684 billion per year.81 Credit unions make nearly 
$38 billion in small business loans to their members each year, and at 43.6 percent, the approval rates
at credit unions for small business loan requests are higher than those at large banks (18.6 percent) but 
lower than those at small banks (51.6 percent).82 Not every credit union makes business loans (about 
30 percent of credit unions do), and credit unions don’t make loans to just anyone. To qualify for a
loan, an entrepreneur must be a member. Lending practices at credit unions are very much like those 
at banks, but credit unions usually are willing to make smaller loans. Federal law currently limits a 
credit union’s loans to businesses to 12.25 percent of the credit union’s assets. The SBA also recently 
opened its 7(a) loan program to credit unions, providing yet another avenue for entrepreneurs in
search of financing. Because banks have tightened their lending requirements, many entrepreneurs 
are turning to credit unions for start-up and operating business loans.

PRIVATE PLACEMENTS Private placements are also available for both equity and debt instruments. 
A private placement involves selling debt to one or a small number of investors, usually insurance 
companies or pension funds. Private placement debt is a hybrid between a conventional loan and 
a bond. At its heart, it is a bond, but its terms are tailored to the borrower’s individual needs as a 
loan would be.
In addition to making equity investments in small companies, venture capital firms also provide 
venture debt financing, often in private placements. Interest rates on venture debt typically vary 
from prime-plus-1-percent to prime-plus-5-percent, and the loan terms range from 24 to 48 months. 
Venture debt deals often include warrants, which give the venture capital firm the right to purchase 
shares of stock in a company at a fixed price. Venture debt financing is a hybrid between a loan and 
venture capital. Most venture loans also come with covenants, requirements that a company must 
meet or incur a penalty, such as paying a higher interest rate or giving up more stock.
SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs),
created in 1958 when Congress passed the Small Business Investment Act, are privately owned 
financial institutions that are licensed and regulated by the SBA. The 292 SBICs operating in 
the United States use a combination of private capital and federally guaranteed debt to provide 
growing small businesses with long-term venture capital. Like their venture capital counterparts, 
most SBICs prefer later-round financing over funding start-ups; about 20 percent of SBIC 
investments go to start-up businesses.84 Funding from SBICs helped launch companies such as
Costco, Apple, Intel, Gymboree, Cutter and Buck, Build-a-Bear Workshop, Federal Express, 
Staples, Sun Microsystems, and Callaway Golf.
Since 1958, SBICs have provided more than $60 billion in long-term debt and equity fi-
nancing to some 107,000 small businesses, adding hundreds of thousands of jobs to the U.S. 
economy.85 SBICs must be capitalized privately with a minimum of $5 million, at which point 
they qualify for up to $3 (but most often $2) in long-term SBA loans for every $1 of private capi-
tal invested in small businesses up to a maximum of $150 million. As a general rule, SBICs may
provide financial assistance only to small businesses with a net worth of less than $18 million
and average after-tax earnings of $6 million during their last two years. However, employment 
and total annual sales standards vary from industry to industry. SBICs are limited to a maximum 
investment or loan amount of 20 percent of their private capital to a single client.
SBICs provide both debt and equity financing to small businesses. Most SBIC financing is
in the much-needed range of $250,000 to $5 million, and the average investment is $1.55 million,
far below the average investment by venture capital firms of $7.4 million.86 When they make 
equity investments, SBICs are prohibited from obtaining a controlling interest in the companies 
in which they invest (no more than 49 percent ownership).

of Gemcor II, LLC, developed the automated riveting machine used worldwide by aircraft 
manufacturers during World War II. For decades, the company was a major player in the aircraft
industry, but when the aircraft manufacturing industry went through a prolonged slump in the
early 2000s, Gemcor received an investment from Rand Capital SBIC, Inc., to help reengineer its sup-
ply chain and implement a variable cost supply model. After Rand Capital SBIC’s investment and the 
changes it helped fund, Gemcor’s revenues grew from $8 million to $19 million seven years later. 
During that same period, the number of employees at Gemcor for doubled from 31 to 61.87 ■

Economic Development Administration
The Economic Development Administration (EDA), a branch of the Commerce Department, offers 
loan guarantees to create new businesses and to expand existing businesses in areas with below-
average incomes and high unemployment rates. Focusing on economically distressed communi-
ties, the EDA often works with local governments to finance long-term investment projects needed 
to stimulate economic growth and to create jobs by making loan guarantees. The EDA guarantees 
loans up to 80 percent of business loans between $750,000 and $10 million. Entrepreneurs apply 
for loans through private lenders, for whom an EDA loan guarantee significantly reduces the risk 
of lending. Start-ups and existing businesses must make equity investments of at least 15 percent 
of the guaranteed amount. Small businesses can use the loan proceeds in a variety of ways, from
supplementing working capital and purchasing equipment to buying land and renovating buildings.
EDA business loans are designed to help revitalize economically distressed areas by creat-
ing or expanding small businesses that provide employment opportunities in local communities.
To qualify for a loan, a business must be located in a disadvantaged area, and its presence must 
directly benefit local residents. Some communities experiencing high unemployment or suffering 
from the effects of devastating natural disasters have received EDA Revolving Loan Fund Grants 
to create loan pools for local small businesses.

VoWac, based in Faulkton, South Dakota, serves more than 2,000 schools in 35 states as well as schools
in Asia and Africa. The company has grown enough to employ four full-time employees.88 ■
Department of Housing and Urban Development
Although the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) does not extend loans or 
grants directly to entrepreneurs for launching businesses, it does sponsor several programs that 
can help qualified entrepreneurs to raise the capital they need. Community Development Block 
Grants (CDBGs) are extended to cities and counties that, in turn, lend or grant money to entre-
preneurs to start or expand small businesses, thereby strengthening the local economy. Grants are 
aimed at cities and towns that need revitalization and economic stimulation. Some grants are used 
to construct buildings and factories to be leased to entrepreneurs, sometimes with an option to 
buy. Others are earmarked for revitalizing a crime-ridden area or making start-up loans to entre-
preneurs or expansion loans to existing business owners. No ceilings or geographic limitations are 
placed on CDBG loans and grants, but projects must benefit low- and moderate-income families.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Cheryl and Stephen Kraus: Upcountry Provisions
Bakery & Bistro When Cheryl and Stephen Kraus were renovating a building in down-
town Traveler’s Rest, South Carolina, to house their retail bakery, the copreneurs received a $5,750
Façade Improvement Grant from a grant funded by HUD’s CDBG program. The 1,664-square-foot 
building on Main Street that serves as the home for the Upcountry Provisions Bakery & Bistro once 
housed a drugstore but had stood vacant for 20 years. The Kraus’s wanted a location with more
foot traffic, which this grant allowed them to secure with the Main Street location.89 ■
HUD also makes loan guarantees through its Section 108 provision of the CBDG program. 
These loan guarantees allow a community to transform a portion of CDBG funds into federally 
guaranteed loans large enough to pursue economic revitalization projects that can lead to the 
renewal of entire towns.
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Business Programs and Loans
The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides financial assistance to certain small businesses
through partnerships with the private sector and the community-based organizations. The 
various programs fund projects that create or preserve quality jobs and/or promote a clean ru-
ral environment in underserved rural communities. For example, through its Business and 
Industry Guaranteed Loan Program, the Rural Development Rural Business Services (RBS) will
guarantee as much as 80 percent of a commercial lender’s loan up to $5 million, 70 percent for 

532
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
loans between $5 million and $10 million, and 60 percent for loans in excess of $10 million. 
Entrepreneurs apply for loans through private lenders, who view applicants with loan guaran-
tees much more favorably than those without guarantees. The guarantee reduces a lender’s risk 
dramatically because the guarantee means that the government agency would pay off the loan 
balance (up to the ceiling) if the entrepreneur defaults on the loan.

with the Hope Development Corporation and the Griggs-Steele Empowerment Zone in Hope, 
North Dakota, La Rinascente Pasta received a guarantee on a $1.2 million loan from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture’s Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program that allowed the 
company to purchase the machinery and equipment for its new pasta manufacturing plant.90 ■
Small Business Innovation Research Program
Started as a pilot program by the National Science Foundation in the 1970s, the Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) program has expanded to 11 federal agencies, ranging from NASA 
to the Department of Defense. The total SBIR budget across all 11 agencies is more than $2 billion 
annually. These agencies award cash grants or long-term contracts to small companies that want 
to initiate or to expand their R&D efforts. SBIR grants give innovative small companies the op-
portunity to attract early-stage capital investments without having to give up significant equity
t
stakes or taking on burdensome levels of debt.
The SBIR process involves three phases. Phase I (“proof of concept”) grants, which determine 
the feasibility and commercial potential of a technology or product, last for up to six months and 
have a ceiling of $150,000. Phase II (“prototype development”) grants, designed to develop the 
concept into a specific technology or product, run for up to 24 months and have a ceiling of $1 mil-
lion. Approximately one-third of all Phase II applicants receive funding. Phase III is the commer-
cialization phase, in which the company pursues commercial applications of the R&D conducted in
Phase I and Phase II and must use private or non-SBIR federal funding to bring a product to market.
Competition for SBIR funding is intense; only 17 percent of the small companies that apply
for Phase I grants receive funding. So far, more than 135,000 SBIR awards totaling more than 
$34 billion (72 percent in Phase I and 28 percent in Phase II) have gone to small companies, 
which traditionally have had difficulty competing with big corporations for federal R&D dollars. 
The average grant, including Phase I and Phase II, is $342,000.91 The government’s dollars have 
been well invested. Nearly 45 percent of small businesses receiving Phase II SBIR awards have 
achieved commercial success with their products.92
Small Business Technology Transfer Program
The Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) complements the SBIR program. 
Whereas the SBIR focuses on commercially promising ideas that originate in small businesses, 
the STTR helps companies to use the vast reservoir of commercially promising ideas that originate 
in universities, federally funded R&D centers, and nonprofit research institutions. Researchers 
at these institutions can join forces with small businesses and can spin off commercially promis-
ing ideas while remaining employed at their research institutions. Five federal agencies award 
grants of up to $750,000 in three phases to these research partnerships.
State and Local Loan Development Programs
Many states have created their own loan and economic development programs to provide funds 
for business start-ups and expansions. They have decided that their funds are better spent en-
couraging small business growth rather than “chasing smokestacks”—trying to entice large busi-
nesses to locate within their boundaries. These programs come in many forms, but they all tend 
to focus on developing small businesses that create the greatest number of jobs and economic
benefits. Entrepreneurs who apply for state and local funding must have patience and be willing 
to slog through some paperwork, however.
Although each state’s approach to economic development is somewhat special, one common
element is some kind of small business financing program: loans, loan guarantees, development 

CHAPTER 13 • SOURCES OF FINANCING: EQUITY AND DEBT
533
grants, venture capital pools, and others. One approach many states have had success with is
Capital Access Programs (CAPs). First introduced in Michigan in 1986, many states now offer 
CAPs that are designed to encourage lending institutions to make loans to businesses that do not 
qualify for traditional financing because of their higher risk. Under a CAP, a bank and a borrower 
each pay an upfront fee (a portion of the loan amount) into a loan-loss reserve fund at the partici-
pating bank, and the state matches this amount. The reserve fund, which normally ranges from 
6 to 14 percent of the loan amount, acts as an insurance policy against the potential loss a bank 
might experience on a loan and frees the bank to make loans that it otherwise might refuse. One 
study of CAPs found that 55 percent of the entrepreneurs who received loans under a CAP would
not have been granted loans without the backing of the program.93
Even cities and small towns have joined in the effort to develop small businesses and help
them grow. Many communities across the United States operate revolving loan funds that com-
bine private and public funds to make loans to small businesses, often at favorable interest rates, 
for the purpose of starting or expanding businesses that create jobs and contribute to economic
development. As money is repaid into the funds, it is loaned back out to other entrepreneurs.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Oregon Business Development Fund: Krauss Craft,
Inc. Krauss Craft, Inc., located in Merlin, Oregon, manufactures commercial playground 
equipment under the trademark Playcraft Systems and sells its products nationwide to cities, 
school districts, and park districts. Krauss Craft secured a $500,000 loan through the Oregon Busi-
ness Development Fund (OBDF) to build a 30 ,000-square-foot building and to purchase two ro-
tational molding machines and related equipment. Krauss Craft added 40 new jobs as a result of
the expansion project.94 ■
In addition to revolving loan funds, nearly 1,000 communities across the United States have 
created community development financial institutions (CDFIs) that designate at least some of 
their loan portfolios to supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses. CDFIs operate through a va-
riety of institutions, including microenterprise loan funds, community development loan funds, and 
others to provide capital and credit to otherwise “unbankable” business owners and aspiring entre-
preneurs in low-income communities across the United States. Because the loans that they make are
higher risk, the interest rates that CDFIs charge are higher than those charged by traditional lenders.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tina Ferguson-Riffe: Smoke Berkeley Tina Ferguson-
Riffe had been unemployed for three years before she started her restaurant, Smoke 
Berkeley, in Berkeley, California. Ferguson-Riffe needed to buy new equipment to support the 
growth of her business. Unable to secure a traditional business loan, a program called the Oppor-
tunity Fund offered Tina a $20,000 EasyPay loan. Instead of making a fixed monthly payment, 
Smoke Berkeley repays its loan based on daily credit and debit card sales. Ferguson-Riffe says be-
ing able to pay the loan back based on sales helps when seasonal slowdowns occur during the 
rainy season.95 ■
Other Methods of Financing
Small business owners do not have to rely solely on financial institutions and government agen-
cies for capital; their businesses have the capacity to generate capital. Other common methods of 
financing, including factoring, leasing rather than purchasing equipment, and using credit cards, 
are available to almost every small business.
Factoring Accounts Receivable
Instead of carrying credit sales on its own books (some of which may never be collected), a small 
business can sell outright its accounts receivable to a factor. A factor buys a company’s accounts
receivable and pays for them in two parts. The first payment, which the factor makes immedi-
ately, is for 50 to 80 percent of the accounts’ agreed-on (and usually discounted) value. The fac-
tor makes the second payment of 15 to 18 percent, which makes up the balance less the factor’s 
service fees, when the original customer pays the invoice. High interest rates (often 36 percent or 
more) make factoring a more expensive type of financing than loans from either banks or com-
mercial finance companies, but for businesses that cannot qualify for those loans, it may be the 
only choice. Factoring volume totals more than $101 billion per year.96

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Factoring deals are either with recourse or without recourse. Under deals arranged with
recourse, a small business owner retains the responsibility for customers who fail to pay their 
accounts. The business owner must take back these uncollectible invoices. Under deals arranged
without recourse, however, the owner is relieved of the responsibility for collecting them. If cus-
tomers fail to pay their accounts, the factor bears the loss. Nearly 70 percent of factoring deals 
are without recourse.97 Because the factor assumes the risk of collecting the accounts, it screens 
a company’s credit customers, accepts those judged to be creditworthy, and advances the small 
business owner a portion of the value of the accounts receivable. Factors discount anywhere from 
2 to 40 percent of the face value of a company’s accounts receivable, depending on the following 
factors related to a small company:
● Customers’ financial strength and credit ratings
● The industry and its customers’ industries because some industries have a reputation for 
slow payments
● History and financial strength, especially in deals arranged with recourse
● Credit policies98
The discount rate on deals without recourse usually is higher than on those with recourse because
of the higher level of risk they carry for the factor.
Although factoring is more expensive than traditional bank loans (a 2 percent discount from 
the face value of an invoice due in 30 days amounts to an annual interest rate of 24.8 percent), it 
is a source of quick cash and is ideally suited for fast-growing companies, especially start-ups that 
cannot qualify for bank loans. Small companies that sell to government agencies and large corpo-
rations, both famous for stretching out their payments for 60 to 90 days or more, also find factor-
ing attractive because they collect the money from the sale (less the factor’s discount) much faster.
Leasing
Leasing is another common bootstrap financing technique. Today, small businesses can lease vir-
tually any kind of asset, including office space, telephones, computers, and heavy equipment. By
leasing expensive assets, the small business owner is able to use them without locking in valuable 
capital for an extended period of time. In other words, entrepreneurs can reduce the long-term
capital requirements of their businesses by leasing equipment and facilities and are not investing
their capital in depreciating assets. In addition, because no down payment is required and because
the cost of the asset is spread over a longer time (lowering monthly payments), a company’s cash 
flow improves.
ROBS
Thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs, particularly Baby Boomers, are tapping into their retire-
ment accounts to fund business start-ups or acquisitions of existing small businesses. Many of 
them are turning to Rollovers as Business Startups (ROBS) as a means of using their retire-
ment savings to fund their businesses. By using a 401(k) rollover, entrepreneurs are able to move 
existing retirement funds into a start-up. The tax laws governing ROBS 
are complex, and if not set up properly, this form of funding can lead to
significant penalties by the IRS. Recent IRS cases show increased scru-
tiny of these funding plans, so entrepreneurs should exercise extreme 
care when using a retirement account rollover to fund a business. Once 
established, ROBS require entrepreneurs to meet certain reporting and 
fiduciary responsibilities.99

into her 401(k) to repay the loan from her retirement account. If Jones is ever late with a payment, 
which is due within seven days of each payroll, the IRS imposes a penalty.100 ■
Merchant Cash Advance
A merchant cash advance is used by small businesses to help finance working capital needs. 
The provider of the merchant cash advance prepurchases credit and debit card receivables at a
discount. Each time a sale is made, a percentage of the card receivable is forwarded to the cash 
advance provider or purchaser until all of the purchased receivables are paid off. Merchant cash
advances are most often used for the purchase of new equipment, purchasing inventory, expan-
sion or remodeling, payoff of debt, and emergency funding. Like factoring accounts receivable,
merchant cash advances are an expensive source of funding.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ivan and Mayra Rincon: Orchid Boutique Ivan and
Mayra Rincon, founders of the online swimwear shop Orchid Boutique, needed help funding 
the highly seasonal nature of their business. Although the business had solid profit margins on its 
$3 million in annual sales, the Rincons were always scrambling to find cash to fund the next season’s 
inventory purchases. After several banks rejected their loan requests, they were able to secure a 
merchant cash advance of $200,000. The company had to pay $55,000 for the advance, however,
which meant that the Rincons paid 15 percent of sales to the provider until they paid off the $255,000.
The funding cost the company an effective annual interest rate of more than 50 percent!101 ■
Peer-to-peer Lending
New online funding options are emerging to help small businesses with credit. Peer-to-peer 
loans are Web-based vetting platforms, such as Lending Club, Prosper, and Fundation, that create 
an online community of lenders who provide funding to creditworthy small businesses. Lending
Club reports that it is making more than $120 million in loans to small businesses each month! 
Interest rates can range from less than 7 percent to more than 25 percent. Lending Club has a 
maximum loan limit of $35,000. Lydia Aguinaldo, owner of Pines Home Health Care Services, 
in Broward County, Florida, secured a $250,000 loan from Fundation at a 19 percent interest rate 
payable over three years.102
Loan Brokers
Loan brokers specialize in helping small businesses find loans by tapping into a wide network of 
lenders that include SBA lenders, working capital financing, real estate loans, bridge financing, 
franchise financing, merchant cash advances, and asset-based lending. Most loan brokers do not 
charge a fee for the initial evaluation and consulting on financing options for a small business. 
Loan brokers take a small percentage of the total loan amount, usually 1 to 2.5 percent, once the 
business is successfully financed. MultiFunding, Biz2Credit, and Loan Finder are a few of the 
larger companies offering these services to small business clients.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Patricia and Jim McGrath: Branches Atelier Patricia
and Jim McGrath, owners of Branches Atelier, a preschool in Santa Monica, California, 
wanted to find a larger location to house their growing business. They found a perfect location
to buy. The mortgage would cost them no more each month than their current rent, so they were
confident that getting a loan would not be difficult. However, when they went to their bank—
where they had done business for 20 years—to apply for a loan to buy the building, they were
turned down for their loan request. They were shocked because they had enough cash for a 
down payment and a long waiting list for new students. The McGraths went to a loan brokerage
firm, Multifunding, which was able to find a bank willing to give them the loan they needed to
buy the building.103 ■
Credit Cards
Unable to find financing elsewhere, many entrepreneurs launch their companies using the fast-
est and most convenient source of debt capital available: credit cards. A study by the Kauffman 
Foundation reports that 7 percent of the capital for start-up companies comes from credit cards. 
The study also shows that 58 percent of new businesses rely on credit cards to finance operations 
in their first year of business.104 Putting business start-up costs on credit cards charging 20 percent

or more in annual interest is expensive, risky, and can lead to severe financial woes. A study by 
Robert Scott of Monmouth University and the Kauffman Foundation reports that taking on credit 
card debt reduces the likelihood that a start-up company will survive its first three years of opera-
tion. Every $1,000 increase in credit card debt results in a 2.2 percent increase in the probability 
that a company will fail.105 Putting business start-up costs on credit cards is expensive and risky,
especially if sales fail to materialize as quickly as planned, but some entrepreneurs have no other 
choice. Prudent entrepreneurs rely on credit cards only for making monthly purchases that they
are certain can be paid off when the credit card bill comes due.
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Describe the differences between equity 
capital and debt capital.
Capital is any form of wealth employed to produce 
more wealth. Entrepreneurs have access to two differ-
ent types of capital:
● Equity financing represents the personal investment 
of the owner (or owners), and it offers the advantage 
of not having to be repaid with interest.
● Debt capital is the financing a small business owner 
has borrowed and must repay with interest. It does 
not require entrepreneurs to give up ownership in 
their companies.
2. Discuss the various sources of equity capital 
available to entrepreneurs.
● The most common source of financing a business is 
the owner’s personal savings. After emptying their 
own pockets, the next place entrepreneurs turn for 
capital is family members and friends. Crowdfund-
ing taps the power of social networking and allows 
entrepreneurs to post their elevator pitches and pro-
posed investment terms on crowd-funding Web sites 
and raise money to fund their ventures from ordi-
nary people who invest as little as $100. Angels are
private investors who not only invest their money in 
small companies but also offer valuable advice and 
counsel to them. Some business owners have suc-
cess financing their companies by taking on limited 
partners as investors or by forming an alliance with 
a corporation, often a customer or a supplier. Ven-
ture capital companies are for-profit, professional 
investors looking for fast-growing companies in 
“hot” industries. When screening prospects, venture 
capital firms look for competent management, a 
competitive edge, a growth industry, and important 
intangibles that will make a business successful. 
Some owners choose to attract capital by taking 
their companies public, which requires registering 
the public offering with the SEC.
3. Describe the process of “going public.”
● Going public involves (1) choosing the underwriter, 
(2) negotiating a letter of intent, (3) preparing the 
registration statement, (4) filing with the SEC, and 
(5) meeting state requirements.
4. Describe the various sources of debt capital.
● Commercial banks offer the greatest variety of 
loans, although they are conservative lenders. Typi-
cal short-term bank loans include commercial loans, 
lines of credit, discounting accounts receivable, in-
ventory financing, and floor planning.
● Trade credit is used extensively by small businesses
as a source of financing. Vendors and suppliers
commonly finance sales to businesses for 30, 60, or 
even 90 days.
● Equipment suppliers offer small businesses 
financing similar to trade credit but with slightly 
different terms.
● Commercial finance companies offer many of 
the same types of loans that banks do, but they
are more risk oriented in their lending practices. 
They emphasize accounts-receivable financing and 
inventory loans.
● Savings-and-loan associations specialize in loans to
purchase real property—commercial and industrial 
mortgages—for up to 30 years.
● Stock brokerage houses offer loans to prospective 
entrepreneurs at lower interest rates than banks 
because they have high-quality, liquid collateral—
stocks and bonds in the borrower’s portfolio.
● Small Business Investment Companies are privately
owned companies licensed and regulated by the 
SBA that qualify for SBA loans to be invested in or 
loaned to small businesses.
● Small Business Lending Companies make only 
intermediate- and long-term loans that are guaran-
teed by the SBA.

create nonfarm employment opportunities in rural 
areas through loans and loan guarantees.
● The Small Business Innovation Research Program 
involves 11 federal agencies that award cash grants 
or long-term contracts to small companies wanting
to initiate or to expand their R&D efforts.
● The Small Business Technology Transfer Program 
allows researchers at universities, federally funded 
R&D centers, and nonprofit research institutions to 
join forces with small businesses and develop com-
mercially promising ideas.
● Many state and local loan and development pro-
grams, such as capital access programs, revolving 
loan funds, and community development financial 
institutions, complement those sponsored by federal 
agencies.
7. Explain other methods of financing a business.
● Business owners can get the capital they need by 
factoring accounts receivable, leasing equipment 
instead of buying it, borrowing against their retire-
ment accounts, borrowing against future credit card 
sales, borrowing from peers, using a loan broker, or 
even using credit cards.
5. Describe the various loan programs available 
from the Small Business Administration.
● Almost all SBA loan activity is in the form of loan 
guarantees rather than direct loans. Popular SBA
programs include: the SBA Express program, the 
Patriot Express program, the 7(a) loan guaranty 
program, the Section 504 Certified Development 
Company program, the Microloan program, the 
CAPLine program, the Export Working Capital pro-
gram, and the Disaster Loan program.
6. Identify the various federal and state loan 
programs aimed at small businesses.
● The Economic Development Administration, a 
branch of the Commerce Department, makes loan 
guarantees to create and expand small businesses in 
economically depressed areas.
● The Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment extends grants (such as Community Develop-
ment Block Grants) to cities that, in turn, lend and 
grant money to small businesses in an attempt to 
strengthen the local economy.
● The Department of Agriculture’s Rural Business 
Cooperative Service loan program is designed to

CHAPTER 14 • CHOOSING THE RIGHT LOCATION AND LAYOU
A
T
541
Location: A Source of Competitive Advantage
Much like choosing a form of ownership and selecting particular sources of financing, the location 
decision has far-reaching and often long-lasting effects on a small company’s future. Entrepreneurs 
who choose their locations wisely—with their customers’ preferences and their companies’ needs 
in mind—establish an important competitive advantage over rivals who choose their locations hap-
hazardly. Because the availability of qualified workers, tax rates, quality of infrastructure, traffic 
patterns, quality of life, and many other factors vary from one site to another, the location decision 
is an important one that can influence the growth rate and ultimate success of a company. Thanks 
to widespread digital connectivity, mobile computing, extensive cellular coverage, and affordable 
air travel, entrepreneurs have more flexibility when choosing a business location than ever before.
Every gardener knows that for a particular plant to thrive and grow, it must be in the right 
location to suit its needs. Too much shade (or sun), the wrong type of soil, or too much (or too 
little) water will cause the plants to wither. Similarly, a particular business must have the right lo-
cation to suit its needs if it is to thrive. Like plants, the conditions that a business requires depend
on the type of business involved, but the location decision is important for every business because
of its influence on the company’s sales. Myriad variables influence an entrepreneur’s choice of 
a location, often making for a difficult decision. However, by conducting research and gathering
and analyzing information about potential sites, entrepreneurs can find locations that are ideally 
suited for their businesses. When screening sites for both Disneyland and Disney World, Walt and
Roy Disney hired site selection pioneer Buzz Price to conduct exhaustive studies that included a 
demographic analysis, population growth projections, future highway construction, accessibility,
weather patterns, and other relevant factors. The location analysis successfully pinpointed ideal
locations for both Disney theme parks; today the two parks host more than 33 million guests each
year. “Buzz nailed both of those locations dead center,” says Chip Cleary, head of the Interna-
tional Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.1
The location decision process resembles an inverted pyramid. The first level of the decision 
is the broadest, requiring an entrepreneur to select a particular region of the country. (We will 
address locating a business in a foreign country in Chapter 15.) Then an entrepreneur must 
choose the right state, the right city, and, finally, the right site within the city. The key to selecting 
the ideal location lies in knowing the factors that are most important to a company’s success and 
then finding a location that satisfies as many of them as possible, particularly those that are most 
critical. For instance, one of the most important location factors for high-tech companies is the 
availability of a skilled labor force, and their choice of location reflects this. If physically locating 
near customers is vital to a company’s success, an entrepreneur’s goal is to find a site that makes
it most convenient for his or her target customers to do business with the company.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tony and John Calamunci: Johnny’s Lunch Tony and
John Calamunci sell franchises of the family-owned diner that their grandparents, Johnny 
and Minnie Colera, started in Brooklyn Square in Jamestown, New York, in 1936 (and that their 
Y
parents still operate). In launching the franchise operation, they realized that opening outlets in
areas in which large concentrations of their target customers lived was essential to their success. 
They hired an experienced franchise veteran, George Goulson, and worked with Pitney-Bowes 
Software’s MapInfo, using geospatial technology to determine the ideal locations for their restau-
rants, which sell budget-priced meals such as hot dogs, hamburgers, onion rings, and milkshakes. 
The Calamuncis started by defining their target customers, which they discovered include people 
in the lower-middle- to upper-middle-income bracket who fall between the ages of 16 and 24 or 
over 60. Using the software, they identified 72 types of neighborhoods that best match the demo-
graphic and psychographic profile of Johnny’s Lunch customers. The next step was to find loca-
tions that matched the 72 prototype neighborhoods. Managers identified 4,500 areas across the 
United States that held large concentrations of potential Johnny’s Lunch customers (most of
whom lived within one mile of the proposed location) and would be good locations for restau-
rants. “These models increase our ability to pick ‘home-run’ locations and avoid the site mistakes 
that can cripple a budding franchise,” says Goulson. Johnny’s Lunch is launching its franchising
effort in and around Toledo, Ohio, which Goulson says is a microcosm of the United States. “Small 
restaurant owners like us can use location intelligence to prevent mistakes that could cripple fran-
chising plans from the start. We can’t afford not to invest in location intelligence.”2 ■

The characteristics that make for an ideal location vary dramatically from one company to 
another because of the nature of their business. In the early twentieth century, companies looked 
for ready supplies of water, raw materials, or access to railroads; today, they are more likely to 
look for sites that are close to universities and offer high-speed Internet access and accessible 
airports. In fact, one study concluded that the factors that make an area most suitable for starting 
and growing small companies included access to dynamic universities, an ample supply of skilled
workers, a nearby airport, a temperate climate, and a high quality of life.3 The key to finding a
suitable location is identifying the characteristics that can give a company a competitive edge and 
then searching out potential sites that meet those criteria.
Choosing the Region
The first step in selecting the best location is to focus on selecting the right region. This requires 
entrepreneurs to look at the location decision from the “30,000-foot level,” as if he or she were in 
an airplane looking down. In fact, in the early days of their companies, Sam Walton, founder of 
retail giant Wal-Mart, and Ray Kroc, who built McDonald’s into a fast-food giant, actually used 
private planes to survey the countryside for prime locations for their stores.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Walt Disney: Disney World In 1963, Walt Disney flew 
over central Florida in a private plane (which is now on display at Disney World) to look at
a tract of nondescript swampland as a potential site for Disney World. Disney lacked sufficient 
space to expand Disneyland in California and, with the help of site selection expert Buzz Price and 
a group of top managers, established several criteria for the company’s second theme park, in-
cluding a place with good weather throughout most of the year, plenty of land at bargain prices,
a location near a major city, and access to major highways and infrastructure for the company’s
second theme park (dubbed “Project X”). When Disney flew over the intersection of Interstate 4
and Route 192 near Orlando, he knew he had found the ideal location for Disney World, which 
now encompasses 30,000 acres, an area that is about the size of San Francisco!4 ■
Which region of the country has the characteristics necessary for a new business to succeed? 
Above all, entrepreneurs must place their customers first when considering a location. As the 
experience of Johnny’s Lunch suggests, facts and statistics, not speculation, lead entrepreneurs
to the best locations for their businesses. Common requirements may include rapid growth in the 

CHAPTER 14 • CHOOSING THE RIGHT LOCATION AND LAYOU

population of a certain age-group, rising disposable incomes, the existence of necessary infra-
structure, an available workforce, and low operating costs. At the broadest level of the location 
decision, entrepreneurs prefer to locate in regions of the country that are experiencing substantial 
growth. Every year, many popular business publications prepare reports on the various regions 
of the nation—which ones are growing, which are stagnant, and which are declining. Studying 
overall trends in population and business growth gives entrepreneurs an idea of where the action 
is—and isn’t. Questions to consider include the following: How large is the population? How fast 
is it growing? What is the makeup of overall population? Which segments are growing fastest? 
Slowest? What is the trend in the population’s income? Are other businesses moving into the
region? If so, what kind of businesses? Generally, entrepreneurs want to avoid declining regions; 
they simply cannot support a broad base of potential customers.
One of the first stops entrepreneurs should make when conducting a regional evaluation is 
the U.S. Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/). There entrepreneurs can access for specific lo-
cations vital demographic information such as age, income, educational level, employment level, 
occupation, ancestry, commuting times, housing data (house value, number of rooms, mortgage 
or rent status, number of vehicles owned, and so on), and many other characteristics. With a little 
practice, entrepreneurs can prepare customized reports on the potential sites they are considering. 
These Web-based resources give entrepreneurs instant access to important site-location informa-
tion that only a few years ago would have taken many hours of intense research to compile. In 
2012, the Census Bureau ceased publication of the U.S. Statistical Abstract (published annually 
t
since 1878), which contained about 1,400 useful data sets about the United States, ranging from 
basic population characteristics and leisure activity expenditures to poverty rates and energy con-
sumption. However, ProQuest, an information gateway company founded in 1943, now publishes 
in both print and online formats the ProQuest Statistical Abstract of the United States (http://
cisupa.proquest.com/ws_display.asp?filter=Statistical%20Abstract), which closely resembles the 
discontinued Census Bureau publication.
The Census Bureau’s American FactFinder site (http://factfinder.census.gov) provides easily 
accessible demographic fact sheets and maps on nearly every community in the United States, 
including small towns. The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey provides annual up-
dates on the demographic and economic characteristics of areas with populations of at least 
65,000, three-year updates on areas with populations between 20,000 and 65,000, and five-year 
updates on areas with populations of less than 20,000. Both the American FactFinder and the 
American Community Survey allow entrepreneurs to produce easy-to-read, customizable maps 
of the information they generate in their searches.
Entrepreneurs also can use nongovernment sources to research potential locations. Zoom-
Prospector (www.zoomprospector.com) is a useful Web site that allows entrepreneurs to search 
for the ideal location using a multitude of factors, including population size, job growth rate, 
number of patents issued, venture capital invested, education level, household incomes, and prox-
imity to interstate highways, railroads, and airports. Once entrepreneurs locate a city that matches
their customer profiles, they can find other cities across the United States that have similar pro-
files with a single mouse click. Entrepreneurs who are considering a particular region can display 
“heat maps” that visually display the areas that have the highest concentrations of people who 
have a particular characteristic, such as a bachelor’s degree or the highest household incomes.

nesses, uses ZoomProspector to find the best locations across the United States for the rapidly 
expanding company’s new offices. Sarowitz says ZoomProspector helps his company answer the
important question, Would this be a good market for us? “What’s great about ZoomProspector is 
that we can get so much information about each individual market we are considering—market 
demographics, which industries are strongest, education levels, and more, “says Sarowitz. Founded 
in 1997, Paylocity, which is based in Arlington Heights, Illinois, and has appeared on Inc.’s list of 
the 5,000 fastest-growing companies seven times, now has 14 locations and, with ZoomProspector’s
help, is looking to add more.5 ■
Zipskinny (www.zipskinny.com) is a Web site that provides quick census data profiles of 
various ZIP codes across the United States and allows users to compare the demographic profiles 
of the people who live in different ZIP codes. The Population Reference Bureau (www.prb.org)

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
provides a detailed breakdown of the most relevant data collected from the most recent census 
reports. The Population Reference Bureau’s DataFinder is a database that includes 244 variables
for the United States and 132 variables for 210 other nations. The site includes easy-to-generate 
maps and charts and helpful articles that discuss the implications of the changing demographic 
and economic profile of the nation’s (and the world’s) population, such as the impact of aging 
baby boomers on business and the composition of the U.S. workforce.
Other helpful resources merit mention as well. Lifestyle Market Analyst, a four-part annual 
publication, matches population demographics with lifestyle interests. Section 1 provides demo-
graphics and lifestyle information for 210 “Designated Market Areas” across the United States. 
Section 2 gives demographic and geographic profiles of 77 lifestyle interests that range from avid 
readers and dieters to wine aficionados and pet owners. Section 3 describes the dominant lifestyle 
interests for each of the 210 market areas. Section 4 provides comparisons of other activities that 
correspond with each lifestyle interest. Entrepreneurs can use Lifestyle Market Analyst to deter
t
-
mine, for example, how likely members of a particular market segment are to own a dog, collect 
antiques, play golf, own a vacation home, engage in extreme sports, invest in stocks or bonds, or 
participate in a host of other activities.
Other sources of demographic data include Nielsen Marketplace, Editor and Publisher 
Market Guide, The American Marketplace: Demographics and Spending Patterns, and Zip Code 
Atlas and Market Planner. Nielsen Marketplace provides a comprehensive tool for market 
analysis, allowing customers to generate customized reports and maps that show basic demo-
graphics, lifestyle patterns, and purchasing behavior for almost any market in the United States. 
The site also includes several unique statistics. Effective buying income (EBI) is a measure of 
disposable income, and the buying power index (BPI) is a unique measure of spending power 
that takes population, EBI, and retail sales into account to determine a market’s ability to buy 
goods and services.
The Editor and Publisher Market Guide includes detailed economic and demographic infor-
mation, ranging from population and income statistics to information on climate and transporta-
tion networks for all 3,096 counties in the United States and more than 1,600 key cities in both
the United States and Canada.
The American Marketplace: Demographics and Spending Patterns provides useful demo-
graphic information in eight areas: education, health, income, labor force, living arrangements,
population, race and ethnicity, and spending and wealth. Most of the tables in the book are
derived from government statistics, but The American Marketplace also includes a discussion of 
the data in each table as well as a forecast of future trends. Many users say the primary advantage 
of The American Marketplace is its ease of use.
The U.S. Census Bureau also offers the Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) Web site (http://
www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html) that organizes the wealth of census data by Zip code. The 
database of 33,120 ZCTAs across the United States allows users to create tables and plot maps 
of census data by Zip code.
Site Selection magazine (www.siteselection.com) is another useful resource that helps entre-
preneurs determine the ideal location for their companies. Issues contain articles that summarize 
the incentive programs that states offer, profiles of each region of the country, and the benefits of 
locating in different states.
States now provide geographic information systems (GIS) files online that allow entrepre-
neurs to identify sites that match the criteria they establish for the ideal location. GIS packages 
allow users to search through virtually any database containing a wealth of information and 
plot the results on a map of the country, an individual state, a specific city, or even a single city 
block. The visual display highlights what otherwise would be indiscernible business trends. For 
instance, using GIS programs, entrepreneurs can plot their existing customer base on a map
with various colors representing the different population densities. Then they can zoom in on 
those areas with the greatest concentration of customers, mapping a detailed view of Zip code 
borders or even city streets. GIS street files originate in the U.S. Census Department’s TIGER 
(Topographically Integrated Geographic Encoding Referencing) file, which contains map infor-
mation broken down for every square foot of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). TIGER files 
contain the name and location of every street in the country and detailed block statistics for the 
345 largest urban areas. In essence, TIGER is a massive database of geographic features such as

roads, railways, and political boundaries across the United States that, when linked with mapping
programs and demographic databases, gives entrepreneurs incredible power to pinpoint existing 
and potential customers on easy-to-read digital maps.
The Small Business Administration’s Small Business Development Center (SBDC) program
also offers location analysis assistance to entrepreneurs. These centers, numbering more than 
900 nationwide, provide training, counseling, research, and other specialized assistance to en-
trepreneurs and existing business owners on a wide variety of subjects, all at no charge. They are 
an important resource, especially for those entrepreneurs who may not have access to a computer.
(To locate the SBDC nearest you, contact the SBA office in your state or go to the SBA’s Small 
Business Development Center locator page at http://www.sba.gov/local-assistance.)
For entrepreneurs interested in demographic and statistical profiles of international cities, 
Euromonitor International (http://www.euromonitor.com/) and the Organization for Economic 
Development and Cooperation (http://www.oecd.org) are excellent resources. Plant Location 
International publishes a report, The World’s Most Competitive Cities, that analyzes 100 top cities
around the world on their suitability as locations for various types of businesses.
Once an entrepreneur has identified the best region of the country, the next step is to evaluate 
the individual states in that region.
Choosing the State
Every state has an economic development office working to recruit new businesses. Even though 
the publications produced by these offices will be biased in favor of locating in that state, they 
still are an excellent source of information and can help entrepreneurs assess the business climate
in each state. Some of the key issues to explore include the laws, regulations, and taxes that 
govern businesses, costs of operation, workforce availability, and incentives or investment credits 
the state may offer to businesses that locate there.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Terry Douglas: ProNova Solutions After investing a
year looking at potential sites for a new $52 million manufacturing plant, ProNova Solu-
tions, a company that is developing next-generation proton therapy cancer treatment technology,
selected a location in Pellissippi Place, a technology research and development park in Maryville, 
Tennessee. The area, dubbed Innovation Valley because of its proximity to the University of 
Tennessee and the Oak Ridge National Research Laboratory (ORNL), which is conducting research 
in the field, is ideally suited for ProNova’s needs. Tennessee’s pro-business culture and the area’s
talented workforce and existing infrastructure, including the Pellissippi Parkway, a highway that 
connects the R&D park with ORNL, sold ProNova’s CEO Terry Douglas on the location. Because of 
ORNL, workers in the area already are familiar with the technology that ProNova uses, including 
linear accelerators and cyclotrons.6 ■
Factors that entrepreneurs often consider when choosing a location include proximity to 
markets, proximity to raw materials, wage rates, quantity and quality of the labor supply, general 
business climate, tax rates, Internet access, and total operating costs.
PROXIMITY TO MARKETS Locating close to markets they plan to serve is extremely critical for 
manufacturers, especially when the cost of transporting finished goods is high relative to their 
value. Locating near customers is necessary to remain competitive. Service firms also often find 
that proximity to their clients is essential. If a business is involved in repairing equipment used in 
a specific industry, it should be located where that industry is concentrated. The more specialized
a business or the greater the relative cost of transporting the product to the customer, the more 
likely it is that proximity to the market will be of critical importance in the location decision.
The ability to get finished products to customers quickly is an important location consider-
ation for many companies.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Alan Yu: Lollicup USA Alan Yu, founder and CEO of 
Lollicup USA, a manufacturer of premium beverage and disposable food service products 
such as napkins, cups, and utensils, recently relocated to Chino, a city in California’s San Bernardino 
Valley, to be closer to its customers, many of whom are quick-service restaurants. Yu notes that in
Southern California, the company’s customer base has grown exponentially, and the ability to get 
its products to a large number of customers quickly was a critical factor in Lollicup’s location

546
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
decision. Access to a qualified workforce and lower taxes than those in the company’s former Los
Angeles location added to the area’s attractiveness.7 ■
PROXIMITY TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS For some entrepreneurs, locations 
near suppliers of essential services are vital. Fashion designer Trina Turk, whose company 
produces 11 distinct collections each year, located her business in Alhambra, California, a suburb 
of Los Angeles, rather than in the bustling city center for several reasons, including safety (she 
employs a significant number of young women who sometimes work after normal business hours) 
and low rental rates. However, the location’s main draw is its proximity to Los Angeles’s garment 
district, where many of the company’s sewing contractors are based. Although Turk says her 
company’s neighborhood is not glamorous or known as a fashion center, the location does give 
her company a competitive advantage.8
If a business uses raw materials that are difficult or expensive to transport, it may require a 
location near the source of those raw materials. Transporting heavy, low-value raw material over 
long distances is impractical—and unprofitable. For products in which bulk or weight is not a 
factor, locating manufacturing operations in close proximity to suppliers facilitates quick deliver-
ies and reduces inventory holding costs. Chobani, a maker of Greek yogurt founded by Hamdi 
Ulukaya in 2005, recently opened its second factory in the United States in Twin Falls, Idaho. 
The main reason that Ulukaya chose Idaho as the location for the factory, which, at 1 million 
square feet, is the largest yogurt production facility in the world, is that Idaho is the third larg-
est milk-producing state in the United States. Chobani, the leading maker of Greek yogurt in 
the United States, requires 4 to 5 million pounds of milk each day to produce 3 million cases of 
Greek yogurt each week. Other factors that led to the decision to locate the factory in Twin Falls 
included easier and faster access to markets on the West coast (the company’s other U.S. factory 
is in central New York), a skilled labor force with a strong work ethic, and low operating costs.9
The value of products and materials, their cost of transportation, and their unique functions inter-
act to determine how close a business should be to its suppliers.
WAGE RATES Existing and anticipated wage rates provide another measure for comparison among
states. Wages can sometimes vary from one state or region to another, significantly affecting a 
company’s cost of doing business. For instance, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
the average hourly compensation for workers (including wages and benefits) ranges from a low
of $27.14 in the South to a high of $34.79 in the Northeast.10 Wage rate differentials within 
geographic regions can be even more drastic. When reviewing wage rates, entrepreneurs must 
be sure to measure the wage rates for jobs that relate to their particular industries or companies.
In addition to surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov), local newspaper ads can 
give entrepreneurs an idea of the pay scale in an area. Entrepreneurs also can obtain the latest 
wage and salary surveys with an e-mail or telephone call to the local chambers of commerce for 
cities in the region under consideration. Entrepreneurs should study not only prevailing wage 
rates but also trends in rates. How does the rate of increase in wage rates compare to those in 
other states? Another factor influencing wage rates is the level of union activity in a state. How 
much union organizing activity has the state seen within the last two years? Which industries
have unions targeted in the recent past?
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Bombardier Inc. Bombardier Inc., based in Montreal, 
Canada, recently built a manufacturing plant in what was once dry cactus fields in
Querétaro, Mexico, to produce the Learjet 85, the company’s newest corporate jet. Bombardier
was attracted by lower wage rates, a pool of trained aeronautics engineers from the local
National Aeronautics University of Querétaro, and proximity to customers in both North and 
South America. The availability of a trained labor force and wage rates that are 25 to 30 percent
lower than those in the United States were driving factors in the company’s location decision.11 ■
SIZE AND QUALITY OF LABOR FORCE For many businesses, especially technology-driven companies,
two of the most important characteristics of a potential location are the size and composition of 
the local workforce. The number of workers available in an area and their levels of education,
training, and experience determine a company’s ability to fill jobs with qualified workers at 
reasonable wages. For example, Provo, Utah, home to Brigham Young University (BYU), hosts

a large concentration of technology and software companies, second only to California’s Silicon 
Valley but without the high costs. One reason that software companies find Provo attractive is the 
city’s high concentration of college graduates; nearly 39 percent of its residents have a bachelor’s 
degree or higher (compared to 28.5 percent in the United States as a whole).12 Another feature that 
attracts technology companies to Provo is access to Google Fiber, the super high-speed Internet 
connection currently available in just a handful of cities.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Scott and Ryan Smith and Stuart Orgill: Qualtrics
Scott and Ryan Smith and Stuart Orgill launched Qualtrics, a market research software 
company, from their Provo, Utah, basement in 2002. “We had 20 people working in the basement
at one time,” recalls Orgill, “so we moved to another building and continued to hire.” Qualtrics 
soon outgrew that space and now has 350 employees and more than 5,000 clients worldwide. The 
company benefits from the steady supply of college graduates from nearby BYU and the Univer-
sity of Utah to meet its needs for well-educated employees, 95 percent of whom are locals. “This 
market is filled with a lot of very educated people and is home to a very strong work ethic,”
says Orgill. The area also boasts a high quality of life, offering outdoor activities such as mountain 
biking, skiing, snowboarding, hiking, and fishing, hobbies that appeal to the young people 
Qualtrics hires.13 ■
Before selecting a location, entrepreneurs should know how many qualified people are avail-
able in the area to perform the work required in their businesses. Some states have attempted to
attract industry with the promise of cheap labor. Unfortunately, businesses locating in those states
find unskilled, low-wage workers who are ill suited for performing the work the companies need
and are difficult to train.
Knowing the exact nature of the workforce needed and preparing job descriptions and job 
specifications in advance help business owners to determine whether there is a good match 
between their companies’ needs and the available labor pool. Reviewing the major industries 
already operating in an area provides clues about the characteristics of the local workforce as 
well. Checking educational statistics to determine the number of graduates in relevant fields of 
study tells entrepreneurs about the available supply of qualified workers.
BUSINESS CLIMATE What is the state’s overall attitude toward your kind of business? Has it passed
laws that impose restrictions on the way a company can operate? Do “blue laws” prohibit certain 
business activity on Sundays? Does the state offer small business support programs or financial 
assistance to entrepreneurs?
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Eclipse Aerospace Eclipse Aerospace, maker of “the 
world’s most efficient very light jet,” selected Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the location 
for its new 215,000-square-foot manufacturing facility because of the state’s business-friendly
environment. The state legislature passed legislation that eliminated the sales tax on aircraft 
parts, services, and finished aircraft. Because the base price of Eclipse Aerospace’s newest jet is
$2.9 million, the exemption saves the company hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. The 
company’s factory is conveniently located next to Albuquerque’s International Sunport Airport, 
which boasts one of the longest runways in the United States, and access to a railroad spur and to 
two major interstate highways. In addition, as one CEO points out, Albuquerque treats entrepre-
neurs like rock stars.14 ■
Some states and cities create policies that are more small business friendly than others. 
Texas is the birthplace of many business start-ups, especially technology firms, because it offers 
entrepreneurs ready access to venture capital; quality colleges and universities; a young, well-
educated workforce; and a variety of programs designed to encourage entrepreneurship. Texas
was an early participant in the Startup America program, which is designed to encourage start-up 
companies and to help them succeed. Austin, Texas, is home to Indeed.com, the world’s leading 
job search site. Launched in 2004 by Paul Forster and Rony Kahan, the company attracts more 
than 140 million unique visitors to its Web site each month. Forster and Kahan mainly boot-
strapped Indeed.com but landed $5 million in venture capital and grew the company to more than 
800 employees before selling it to Tokyo-based human resources services company Recruit Co. 
Ltd. for a reported $1 billion.15

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council publishes an annual “small-business-
friendly” ranking of the states and the District of Columbia that includes a composite measure
of 47 factors, ranging from a variety of taxes and regulations to crime rates and energy costs (see
Table 14.1).
TAX RATES Another important factor that entrepreneurs must consider when screening states for 
potential locations is the tax burden they impose on businesses and individuals. Does the state 
impose a corporate income tax? How heavy are the state’s property, income, and sales taxes? 
Income taxes may be the most obvious tax that states impose on both business and individuals, 
but entrepreneurs also must evaluate the impact of payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, 
and specialized taxes on the cost of their operations. Figure 14.1 shows how each state’s overall 
tax burden measured by 100 variables ranks. Currently, seven states impose no state individual
income tax (two others do not tax wage income), and three states have no corporate income tax, 
but state governments always impose taxes of some sort on businesses and individuals.16 In some 
cases, states offer special tax credits or are willing to negotiate fees in lieu of taxes (FILOTs) for 
companies that create jobs and stimulate the local economy. The Outdoor Group LLC, a maker of 
high-end archery equipment, received $900,000 in tax credits from New York by building a new 
manufacturing facility in the Rochester suburb of Henrietta.17
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Clint Greenleaf: Greenleaf Book Group Clint  Greenleaf, 
founder of Greenleaf Book Group, a book publisher dedicated to independent
authors and small presses, moved his company from Ohio to Texas to escape the high tax burden 
Ohio imposed and to capitalize on the highly educated workforce in Texas. Since making the 
move, Greenleaf Book Group’s annual revenue has grown by a factor of 10.18 ■
HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS Speedy, reliable Internet access is an increasingly important 
factor in the location decision (See Figure 14.2). In fact, 95 percent of small businesses that 
have computers have broadband Internet access.19 Fast Internet access is essential for high-tech
companies, those that rely on cloud computing, and those that engage in e-commerce; however, 
even companies that may not sell to customers over the Internet find high-speed Internet to be a 
valuable business tool. Companies that fall behind in high-speed Internet access find themselves
at a severe competitive disadvantage. According to a recent study, 48 percent of small business 
owners in rural areas and 37 percent of business owners in metropolitan areas say they are not 
satisfied with their Internet speed.20 Google Fiber, a high-speed fiber network from Google that 
runs 100 times faster (1 gigabyte per second) than current broadband, is already in place in 
Kansas City (Kansas and Missouri), Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah, and is proving to be an

important factor in many entrepreneurs’ decisions to locate in these cities. Google currently 
is working with other cities, such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh-Durham, 
San Antonio, and San Jose, to bring Google Fiber to their businesses and residents.21
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Brandon Schatz: SportsPhotos.com Brandon Schatz, 
founder of SportsPhotos.com, a company that organizes and helps photographers sell pho-
tos of a variety of athletic events, decided to move his business from Springfield, Missouri, to the
Kansas City Startup Village to take advantage of Google Fiber’s speed. SportsPhoto.com uploads 
hundreds of photos of each event, which requires a fast Internet connection. In Springfield, the 
slow Internet connection always created a bottleneck for the company. However, with Google Fiber, 
which costs 83 percent less than his slower connection did, Schatz can download a batch of photos
that would have taken 30 to 40 hours in just 30 minutes. SportsPhoto.com’s increased efficiency not
only has improved its profitability but also has enabled Schatz to grow the company faster.22 ■
TOTAL OPERATING COSTS When scouting a state in which to locate a company, an entrepreneur 
must consider the total cost of operating a business. For instance, a state may offer low utility 
rates, but its labor costs and tax rates may be among the highest in the nation. To select the 
ideal location, entrepreneurs must consider the impact of a state’s total cost of operation on their 
business ventures. After Feel Golf, a company that makes golf clubs and grips, acquired Pro Line 
Sports, a Sanford, Florida, business that markets the IGOTCHA golf ball retriever, CEO Lee
Miller decided to relocate Feel Golf to Florida from Salinas, California, where the company had 
operated for 15 years. Miller made the move because he was concerned about the effect that the 
high cost of doing business in California had on his company.23
The state evaluation matrix in Table 14.2 provides a handy tool designed to help entrepreneurs 
determine which states best suit the most important location criteria for their companies. This 
same matrix can be adapted to analyze individual cities as well. Claremont McKenna College’s

Choosing the City
POPULATION TRENDS Analyzing over time the lists of “best cities for business” compiled
annually by many magazines reveals one consistent trend: Successful small companies in a city
tend to track a city’s population growth. In other words, more potential customers mean that a 
small business has a better chance of success. The Census Bureau recently named San Antonio,
Texas; Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Houston, Texas; and Austin, Texas, as the 
fastest-growing cities in the United States.26 Austin, a thriving university town that is home to 
many technology-related companies, including Dell, Apple, IBM, and Samsung, is a haven for 
entrepreneurial start-ups. With its funky culture, progressive music scene, abundant festivals 

552
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
(including the quirky South by Southwest Interactive Festival), and temperate climate, the city 
has become a magnet for young, creative people. The median age of Austin’s population is 31.1, 
well below the national average of 37.2. A highly educated workforce, large concentrations of 
angel and venture capital, and an entrepreneurial support system that includes business incubators 
and accelerators such as Capital Factory add to the city’s attractiveness for entrepreneurs.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Alan Knitowski: Phunware Serial entrepreneur Alan 
Knitowski started Phunware, a fast-growing mobile apps company, in Austin, Texas, in 
2009, in the jaws of the Great Recession. Knitowski was drawn to Austin’s highly educated work-
force, entrepreneurial culture and support system, access to start-up capital, and quality of life.
With annual sales approaching $50 million, Phunware’s software facilitates more than 1 trillion 
transactions on mobile devices worldwide each year for many companies, such as NASCAR,
E! Entertainment, ESPN, Adobe, TCM, Discovery Channel, Disney, and many others, helping them

than 150 employees and has raised $43 million in capital in five rounds of financing. From com-
pany headquarters in Austin, Knitowski has a vision to make Phunware the industry leader in
branded mobile applications and a plan to set up offices across the United States, expand its 
operations in Europe and Asia, and perhaps make an initial public offering.27 ■
By analyzing population and other demographic data, entrepreneurs can examine a city in 
detail, and the location decision becomes more than just an educated guess or, worse, a shot in 
the dark. Studying the trends and the demographics of a city, including population size and den-
sity, growth trends, family size, age breakdowns, education, income levels, job categories, gender,
religion, race, and nationality, gives entrepreneurs the facts they need to make an informed location 
decision. Useful information is available from the U.S. Census Bureau for cities of all sizes, includ-
ing metropolitan and micropolitan areas (those with an urban core of between 10,000 and 50,000 
people) and small towns. There are 536 micropolitan areas in the United States, and Table 14.4 
shows the states that have the greatest number of micropolitan areas listed in the top 100.
In fact, using only basic census data, entrepreneurs can determine what home values are 
in an area, how many rooms they contain, how many bedrooms they contain, what percentage 
of the population own their homes, and how much residents’ monthly rental or mortgage pay-
ments are. Imagine how useful that information would be to someone about to launch a bed-
and-bath shop!
A company’s location should match the market for its products or services, and assembling 
a demographic profile tells an entrepreneur how well a particular site measures up to his or her 
target market’s profile. For instance, an entrepreneur planning to open a fine art shop would likely
want information on a city’s household income, size, age, and education level. To succeed, this 
art shop should be located in an area where people appreciate its products and have the discre-
tionary income to purchase them.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Texas Roadhouse, Anchorage, Alaska
Texas Roadhouse, a 410-unit casual dining chain, recently opened its
first restaurant in Anchorage, Alaska, the state’s largest and wealthiest city. 
With a per capita income of nearly $55,000 and a population of nearly 300,000 
people, Anchorage is capturing the attention of several restaurant chains in 
the Lower 48 states. Texas Roadhouse executives say that although somewhat
remote, the market is underserved and represents a huge growth opportu-
nity. The chain’s theme, a steak-oriented menu and country music, fits well
with Alaska’s culture. The Anchorage restaurant incorporates several modifi-
cations that reflect the region’s unique characteristics. The restaurant is big-
ger than those located in the Lower 48; it needs more storage space because 
supply deliveries are less frequent in remote locations. The lights also are 
brighter to offset the long periods of darkness (an average of nearly
18½ hours per day in January) the region experiences in the winter months. 
The menu features the chain’s signature steaks and ice cold beer but also
includes several local items, including salmon and crab legs.28 ■
The amount of available data on the population of any city or town is staggering. These sta-
tistics allow entrepreneurs to compare a wide variety of cities or towns and to narrow the choices 
to those few that warrant further investigation. Analyzing all of this data makes it possible to 
screen out undesirable locations and to narrow the list of suitable locations to a few, but it does
not make the final location decision for an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs must see the potential 
locations on their “short list” firsthand. Only by seeing a potential location can an entrepre-
neur add the intangible factor of intuition into the decision-making process. Spending time at a 
potential location tells an entrepreneur not only how many people frequent it but also what they 
are like, how long they stay, and what they buy. Walking or driving around the area will give an 
entrepreneur clues about the people who live and work there. What are their houses like? What 
kinds of cars do they drive? What stage of life are they in? Do they have children? Is the area on 
the rise, or is it past its prime?
Following are other factors that entrepreneurs should consider when evaluating cities as pos-
sible business locations.
COMPETITION For some retailers, locating near competitors makes sense because similar 
businesses located near one another may serve to increase traffic flow to both. This location 
strategy works well for products for which customers are most likely to comparison shop. For 
instance, in many cities, auto dealers locate next to one another in a “motor mile,” trying to create 
a shopping magnet for customers. The convenience of being able to shop for dozens of brands of 
cars all within a few hundred yards of one another draws customers from a sizable trading area. 
Locating near competitors is a common strategy for restaurants as well.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: George Stathakis: Stax Omega When George Stathakis 
opened his sixth restaurant, Stax Omega, in Greenville, South Carolina, he chose a site at 
the intersection of an interstate highway and a busy road where several other popular restaurants 
were already operating. With years of experience in the restaurant business, Stathakis knows that 
a cluster of restaurants create business for one another. “I always liked the idea of locating my
restaurants near competitors,” he says.29 ■
Of course, this strategy has limits. Overcrowding of businesses of the same type in an area can 
create an undesirable impact on the profitability of all competing firms.
Studying the size of the market for a product or service and the number of existing competi-
tors helps an entrepreneur determine whether he or she can capture a sufficiently large market 
share to earn a profit. Again, census reports can be a valuable source of information. County Busi-
ness Patterns gives a breakdown of businesses in manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and service 
categories and estimates companies’ annual payrolls and number of employees broken down by 
county. ZIP Code Business Patterns provides the same data as County Business Patterns except 
it organizes the data by ZIP code. The Economic Census, which is produced for years that end in 
2 and 7, gives an overview of the businesses in an area—their sales (or other measure of output), 
employment, payroll, and form of organization. It covers eight industry categories, including

retail, wholesale, service, manufacturing, construction, and others, and gives statistics not only at 
the national level but also by state, Metropolitan Statistical Area, county, places with 2,500 or more 
inhabitants, and Zip code. The Economic Census is a useful tool for helping entrepreneurs deter-
mine whether the areas they are considering as a location are already saturated with competitors.
CLUSTERS Some cities have characteristics that attract certain industries, and, as a result,
companies tend to cluster there. Clusters are geographic concentrations of interconnected 
companies that share specialized supply chains, resources, labor force, distribution networks, 
and service providers that are present in a region.30 Businesses in a cluster build on the same 
pool of resources and strengthen the entire business ecosystem in the area. According to Harvard 
professor Michael Porter, clusters allow companies in them to increase their productivity, gain a 
competitive edge, and increase their likelihood of survival. “Specialization in a region increases 
the number of patents and business formations and leads to higher wages,”* adds Harvard’s Rich
Bryden, who has helped develop a map of business clusters in the United States. Northeastern
Ohio is home to dozens of companies, most of them small businesses, in the flexible electronic
components (those that can be bent, folded, and stretched) field, many of them inspired by the 
world-renowned work of Kent State University’s Liquid Crystal Institute and the pioneering work 
in polymer science at the University of Akron and Case Western Reserve University.31 California’s 
Napa Valley boasts more than 300 wineries, many of them small, family-owned operations that 
are among the best in the United States. The region’s climate and soil, both of which are ideal 
for growing grapes, led entrepreneurs to establish wineries as early as 1861. As in most clusters,
over time these vintners shared both knowledge and best practices, leading to the formation of 
more wineries, increased productivity and innovation, and the resulting competitive advantages.32
Once a concentration of companies takes root in a city, other businesses in those industries
tend to spring up there as well. Ogden, Utah, hosted some events for the 2002 Olympics in Salt 
Lake City. With its bountiful mountains, canyons, and rivers and a population devoted to outdoor 
activities ranging from hiking and biking to mountain climbing and skiing, Ogden has become
the hub of a cluster of outdoor sports companies. It offers the ideal location for testing new prod-
ucts, and a nearby airport provides direct international flights for entrepreneurs who are engaged
in international business.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Steve Flagg: Quality Bicycle Products Steve Flagg,
founder of Quality Bicycle Products, a small wholesale bicycle distributor based inBloomington,
Minnesota, chose Ogden for his company’s second location. Flagg, whose company serves 5,000 
independent bicycle shops, was drawn to Ogden by its cluster of companies that make outdoor gear,
its strong pool of labor, its growing retail base, and its easy access to the West Coast market.33 ■
COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMUNITY One of the intangibles that can be determined only by 
a visit to an area is the degree of compatibility a business has with the surrounding community. 
In other words, a small company’s image must fit in with the character of a town and the needs 
and wants of its residents. For example, Beverly Hills’s ritzy Rodeo Drive or Palm Beach’s 
Worth Avenue are home to shops that match the characteristics of the area’s wealthy residents. 
Exclusive shops such as Cartier, Jimmy Choo, Versace, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany & Company
abound, catering to the area’s rich and famous residents.
LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS Before settling on a city, entrepreneurs must consider the 
regulatory burden local government will impose. Government regulations affect many aspects 
of small business’s operation, from acquiring business licenses and building permits to erecting 
business signs and dumping trash. Some cities are regulatory activists, creating so many rules 
that they discourage business creation; others take a more laissez-faire approach, imposing 
few restrictions on businesses. Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants, owner of the Carl’s Jr. 
and Hardee’s quick-service restaurant chains, says getting a building permit in Texas requires 
60 days; in Shanghai, China, the permitting process takes 63 days, and in Novosibirsk, Russia, the
process takes 125 days. In Los Angeles, however, Puzder says getting a building permit requires

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Damien Graf and Robyn Semien: Bibber and Bell
Wine and Spirits Copreneurs Damien Graf and Robyn Semien found the ideal location 
for their wine and spirits shop, Bibber & Bell Wine and Spirits, in the Williamsburg neighborhood 
in Brooklyn, New York.
Y
Negotiating a lease for the building, which is located in a high-traffic area 
just one block away from a busy subway station, took time and patience but was nothing com-
pared to the gyrations the couple had to go through to get a retail liquor license from the State 
Liquor Authority. The paperwork they were required to submit took the Authority took three
months to process while Graf and Semien continued to pay rent (about $14,000) and other ex-
penses (about $6,000) so that they would not lose their desired location. The couple persisted and 
ultimately opened their shop, which they continue to operate successfully.35 ■
Zoning laws can have a major impact on an entrepreneur’s location decision. New York 
City passed the first comprehensive zoning laws in 1916, and most cities now have zoning laws
that divide a city or county into cells or districts to control the use of land, buildings, and sites.36
Their purpose is to contain similar activities in suitable locations. For instance, one section of a 
city may be zoned residential, whereas the primary retail district may be zoned commercial and 
another zoned industrial to house manufacturing operations. Before selecting a particular site 
within a city, entrepreneurs must explore local zoning laws to determine whether there are any 
ordinances that would place restrictions on business activity or that would prohibit establishing a
business altogether. Zoning regulations may make a particular location out of bounds.
In some cases, an entrepreneur may appeal to the local zoning commission to rezone a site
or to grant a variance (a special exception to a zoning ordinance), but this is risky and could be 
devastating if the board disallows the variance. Stan Freemon, opened his first Eggs Up Grill, a 
franchise that serves an extensive breakfast menu as well as sandwiches and salads, on a busy 
road with a high concentration of retail shops in Greenville, South Carolina, in 2014. Several 
months later, Freemon opened his second franchise in Greenville’s vibrant downtown district, 
drawn by its youthful population, art galleries, live theaters, and eclectic mix of retail shops. 
Because zoning laws restricted downtown businesses’ operating hours, Freemon had to secure a 
variance from the city’s Board of Zoning Appeals to open his restaurant between midnight and 
5 a.m.37 As the number of home-based businesses has increased in the last several years, more 
entrepreneurs have found themselves at odds with city zoning regulations.
APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND UTILITIES Business owners must consider the quality of the 
infrastructure and availability of utilities in a potential location. Is an airport located nearby? Are 
flights available to the necessary cities, and are the schedules convenient? If a company needs 
access to a railroad spur, is one available in the city? How convenient is the area’s access to major 
highways? What about travel distances to major customers? How long will it take to deliver 
shipments to them? Are transportation rates reasonable? In some situations, double or triple 
handling of merchandise and inventory causes transportation costs to skyrocket. Are sufficient 
supplies of necessary inputs such as water and natural gas available? Are utility rates reasonable? 
What impact will utilities costs have on the company’s operation?
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Providencia USA Providencia USA recently built a 
$70 million factory that makes nonwoven fabric in Statesville, North Carolina, because the 
location offered all of the necessary infrastructure that is important to the factory’s success. An 
international airport is just 45 minutes away, and two major interstate highways make transport-
ing finished goods to customers along the East Coast fast and efficient. Railway access was also an 
important factor because railroad delivery is the least expensive way to deliver the pelletized 
polypropylene raw material that Providencia uses in its production process. Finally, the availability 
of low-cost electricity was the “tipping factor” in the company’s location decision.38 ■
INCENTIVES Many states, counties, and cities offer financial and other incentives to encourage 
businesses that will create jobs to locate within their borders. These incentives range from job 
training for workers and reduced tax rates to financial grants and loans. To gear up its economic 
development effort, Minnesota recently included more than $86 million in business incentives in 
zoning laws

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
its budget, but companies have to earn the incentives through capital investments or job creation. 
Emerson Process Management, which manufactures pressure, temperature, flow, level, and 
wireless measurement instruments, earned more than $2.7 million in incentives by investing
$70 million in a factory in Shakopee, Minnesota, that created 500 new jobs. Shutterfly, a 
California-based company that provides personalized digital photo solutions, qualified for a 
$1 million loan through the Minnesota Investment Fund by locating a production and distribution 
center in Shakopee that created 330 jobs.39 Although incentives are not the primary driver of 
companies’ location decisions, they often are the “tie-breaker” between similar sites.
As children, Jo-Ann Morlando and Dominica Clementi, both resi-
dents of Charlotte, North Carolina, learned how to bake from their
beloved Italian grandmothers, affectionately known as Nonas. As 
adults, both women chose professional careers but retained their 
love for baking, often creating delectable sweets for their chil-
dren’s school events or for church gatherings. Before long, their
reputation as stellar bakers led to a constant barrage of requests
for goodies from family members and friends. Sometimes the 
women would work a full day at the office and stay up all night
baking. In 2004, after one marathon baking session, Morlando 
turned to Clementi and said, “Let’s start a bakery.”
They did and named their bakery Nona’s Sweets as a tribute
to their grandmothers, whose recipes they used to create the vari-
ety of sweet treats they offered. Although their original shop was 
small, it was in a good location that drew plenty of customers. 
The bakery thrived, and in the midst of the Great Recession, the 
family decided to expand to a new, carefully chosen location in
Charlotte’s fast-growing University City neighborhood. The build-
ing they rented was in a prominent location in a high-traffic area.
In addition, the local university had announced plans to build a 
football stadium nearby, and the city had announced that it was
going to build a station for the LYNX Blue Line, the city’s light rail 
system (which carries 16,000 people on a typical weekday) that 
it was expanding. Although the bakery was profitable, no banks 
would lend money for the expansion, so Morlando and Clementi 
invested nearly $400,000 in transforming their new location, on 
which they had signed a 10-year lease, into the quaint bakery they 
had always dreamed of. They worked 14-hour days, experiment-
ing with new products, improving their grandmothers’ recipes,
and building their clientele. They added a wedding cake service, a 
cupcake bar, and a section called Papa’s Eats that serves breakfast 
and lunch. Within months, their business was booming; sales and 
profits were higher than ever.
Then in 2012, Morlando and Clementi received a letter from
the city of Charlotte, telling them that the plans for the light rail
expansion had changed. In a cost-cutting move, the city was 
shortening the expansion by 1.2 miles and was going to build 
a five-story parking garage where their building sat. They had
90 days to move their bakery out of the building. Morlando and 
Clementi were stunned and contacted their lawyer. They soon
learned that, despite investing hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in their new location, they were powerless to save it because the 
city could invoke the power of eminent domain, which allows a
government entity to expropriate private property for public use
as long as the government pays “just compensation.” Because the
entrepreneurs were renting the building, they were not entitled to 
any compensation. As word spread throughout the community 
that the building that housed the bakery was being torn down, 
sales began to decline.
Morlando and Clementi wanted to stay in the University City 
area and began searching for a new location, but many sites,
particularly those in shopping centers, were off limits because 
their tenants included grocery stores, which typically have their 
own bakeries, that had negotiated lease provisions that prevent
landlords from leasing space to other bakeries. They finally found 
another suitable building in University City in The Shoppes at
Worthington, a shopping center with no grocery store. The city 
did reimburse Morlando and Clementi for the cost they incurred 
to move their business to the new location, but they received no
compensation for the additional costs of outfitting their new loca-
tion and advertising it or the sales they lost while the bakery was
closed during the transition.
Although the entrepreneurs say they would not want to go 
through another forced move, the tenacious pair is finding reasons 
to be excited about their new location, which allowed them to cre-
ate a space that is warm, welcoming, and relaxing. Shelving allows 
them to boldly display their intricately decorated cakes, tempting
smells lure passersby, and old photographs of nonas from past
generations line the walls and give customers a sense of nostalgia.

business’s location if it better serves the public good? Explain.

Companies that accept incentives must be aware of “clawback” provisions that require them to
repay the state the value of some or all of the incentives if the company fails to create a minimum 
number of jobs or make a minimum capital investment. State and local government entities ap-
proved nearly $270 million in incentives to convince Dell Inc. to build a computer assembly plant 
in Winston–Salem, North Carolina, on the condition that the company create at least 900 jobs. Four 
years later, however, in a move to improve its efficiency, Dell decided to close the factory, which 
required the company to repay $28 million under the contract’s clawback provision.40
QUALITY OF LIFE A final consideration when selecting a city is the quality of life it offers. For many 
entrepreneurs, quality of life is one of the key determinants of their choice of locale. Cities that 
offer comfortable weather, cultural events, colleges and universities, museums, outdoor activities, 
concerts, unique restaurants, and an interesting nightlife have become magnets for entrepreneurs 
looking to start companies. Over the last two decades, cities such as Austin, Boston, Seattle, San 
Francisco, Washington, Dallas, Minneapolis, and others have become incubators for creativity
and entrepreneurship as educated young people drawn by the cities’ quality of life have moved in.
Not only can a location in a city offering a high quality of life be attractive to an entrepre-
neur, but it can also make recruiting employees much easier. According to a study of the impor-
tance of location on recruiting employees conducted by the Human Capital Institute, the three 
most important factors in attracting talent are job opportunities, a clean and safe community, and 
an affordable cost of living.41
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: K.C. Walsh: Simms Fishing Products. A few years ago,
K.C. Walsh, CEO of Simms Fishing Products, a company launched by entrepreneur and fly
fisher John Simms in 1980 that makes fishing waders and accessories, relocated its headquarters 
to Bozeman, Montana. The quality of life (and superb fly fishing) in and around Bozeman was the 
primary factor in the decision. Walsh, a lifelong fly fisher, said his dream was to live, work, and
play in Montana. Because most of the company’s 120 employees are avid fly fishers and outdoor 
enthusiasts, Bozeman’s access to some of the best trout rivers and streams, mountains, and natural 
beauty make it an ideal location for Simms. Montana is a business-friendly state, and Simms can 
field-test its products under real-world conditions quite easily.42 ■
Choosing the Site
The final step in the location selection process is choosing the actual site for the business. Once again,
entrepreneurs must let the facts guide them to the best location. Every business has its own unique 
set of criteria for an ideal location. A manufacturer’s prime consideration may be access to raw ma-
terials, suppliers, labor, transportation, and customers. Service firms require access to customers but 
can generally survive in lower-rent properties. A retailer’s prime consideration is sufficient customer 
traffic. For example, an entrepreneur who is planning to launch a convenience store should know that 
generating a sufficient volume of sales requires a population of at least 500 to 1,000 people who live 
within a one-mile radius of the outlet and choose a location accordingly.43 The one element common
to all three types of businesses is the need to locate where customers want to do business.
Some entrepreneurs test the suitability of potential locations by opening “pop-up” stores, 
shops that are open for only a few days, weeks, or months before shutting down. These temporary 
stores open in available spaces, sell their merchandise quickly, close, and move on to the next 
location; they are low-cost, efficient ways for an entrepreneur to test a location as a potential site
for a permanent business.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Stephen Robins: Pelindaba Lavender Stephen Robins, 
founder of Pelindaba Lavender, a company that sells more than 250 lavender-based pro-
ducts from its farm store on San Juan Island in northwestern Washington, recently opened a pop-
up store in Pacific Place, a downtown retail center in Seattle, to test the area as a site for a permanent
store location. In addition to serving as a test site, the pop-up store serves as a showcase for the 
company’s unique products and introduces them to customers the company normally would not 
reach, including tourists. Because of the pop-up store’s success, Robins is looking for a location
with 900 to 1,000 square feet to house a new permanent Pelindaba Lavender store.44 ■
Rental or lease rates are an important factor when choosing a site. Of course, entrepreneurs 
must be sure that the rent or lease payments for a particular location fit comfortably into their 

558
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
budgets. Although “cheap” rental rates can be indicative of a second-class location (and the re-
sulting poor revenues they generate), entrepreneurs should not agree to exorbitant rental rates that 
jeopardize their ability to surpass their break-even points.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Claude Esnault: Au Grande Richelieu Boulangerie
Claude Esnault, owner for the last 43 years of the Au Grand Richelieu Boulangerie, recently 
closed the landmark bakery, which opened in 1811, because the annual rent had nearly doubled
from €18,000 ($22,860) to €35,000 ($44,450) per year. The landlord claims the new rent is in line
with that of other locations in the fast-growing neighborhood, which is situated near the Opera 
Garnier and the Louvre museum. Unfortunately, Esnault says the bakery, Paris’s oldest, could not 
support rent that high, prompting the decision to close the historic bakery’s doors.45 ■
Many businesses are downsizing their outlets to lower their start-up and operating costs and to
allow for a greater number of location options that are not available to full-size stores. Franchises 
such as Cinnabon and Burger King are finding success by placing smaller, less expensive outlets 
in locations that cannot support a full-size store. Burger King recently opened six Whopper Bars in 
the United States and three international locations in Venezuela and Singapore. At just 700 square 
feet, a Whopper Bar is one-fifth the size of a traditional Burger King outlet and is ideal for locations 
in theme parks, airports, museums, casinos, cruise ships, and shopping malls. A Whopper Bar, 
which sells beer and includes a Whopper topper area in which customers customize the company’s
signature sandwich with 22 different toppings, costs between $600,000 and $800,000 to build,
which is 30 percent less than the smallest traditional Burger King restaurant. Despite its size, the 
Whopper Bar’s sales per square foot exceed those of its full-size franchise outlets.46
Finally, an entrepreneur must be careful to select a site that creates the right impression for a busi-
ness in the customers’ eyes. A company’s location speaks volumes about a company’s “personality.”
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Charlene Dupray and Pascal Siegler: South’n France
When copreneurs Charlene Dupray and Pascal Siegler saw an old diner in downtown Wilm-
ington, North Carolina, with its salmon pink concrete exterior, 13-foot ceilings, and diner stools,
they knew they had found the perfect building to house their chocolate bonbon business, South’n 
France. In addition to its unique character, the building came equipped with freezers capable of
holding 20,000 bonbons, provided sufficient space for Dupray and Siegler to manufacture their 
chocolate delicacies, and included rooms they could convert into a retail storefront. Even though
their business is on the verge of outgrowing the space, Dupray says, “We love it so much that 
we’re considering adding another story or buying nearby residences because this old luncheon-
ette really is a workhorse for us.”47 ■
Location Criteria for Retail and Service Businesses
Few decisions are as important for retailers and service firms as the choice of a location. Be-
cause their success depends on a steady flow of customers, these businesses must locate their 
businesses with their target customers’ convenience and preferences in mind. The following are 
important considerations:
Trade Area Size
Every retail and service business should determine the extent of its trading area, the region from 
which a business can expect to draw customers over a reasonable time span. The primary variables 
that influence the scope of the trading area are the type and size of the business. If a retail store 
specializes in a particular product line and offers a wide selection and knowledgeable salespeople, 
it may draw customers from a great distance. In contrast, a convenience store with a general line of 
merchandise has a small trading area because it is unlikely that customers will drive across town to 
purchase items that are available within blocks of their homes or businesses. As a rule, the larger the
store, the greater its selection, and the better its service, the broader is its trading area. Cabela’s, the 
outdoor outfitter, has nearly 60 stores across the United States and Canada (with more on the way) that 
average 127,500 square feet (one store is 247,000 square feet) and carry more than 225,000 SKUs, 
ranging from outdoor apparel and hunting and fishing gear to boats and home furnishings. With their 
extensive inventories and unique features (museum-quality wildlife displays and huge aquariums),

Pop-up stores are temporary locations that are open for only a 
few hours, days, or weeks before shutting down. For entrepre-
neurs who operate highly seasonal businesses (think Halloween 
costume stores and Christmas décor shops), pop-up stores are a 
way of life, but other entrepreneurs use them to test new business 
ideas or potential locations, create brand awareness, clear out ex-
cess inventory, and promote their full-time locations. Rick Martin
used a pop-up store to test Pacific Place, a popular shopping, din-
ing, and entertainment center in downtown Seattle, Washington, 
as a potential location for his gourmet olive oil and balsamic vin-
egar business, 11 Olives. Martin’s pop-up store proved to be so 
successful that he has begun looking for a permanent location in
Pacific Place.
The Academy of Art University in San Francisco periodically 
opens a pop-up shop to showcase the work of its students and 
alumni. The temporary boutique is filled with a wide array of mer-
chandise, including jewelry, gifts, clothing, and accessories and 
gives students the opportunity to learn firsthand what is required
for fashion to go from an idea to actual products that end up in 
customers’ shopping bags. The pop-up shop has proved to be so 
popular that university officials are considering opening a perma-
nent location in San Francisco.
Before hip-hop artist Kanye West’s Yeezus tour opened in 
New York City, the entertainer used Storefront, a company that 
specializes in helping entrepreneurs and businesses find locations 
for pop-up stores, to find a suitable spot for a pop-up shop to sell 
his merchandise. Four days later, when the tour moved on to its
next venue, the shop closed, but not before selling thousands of
T-shirts, tote bags, caps, and hats.
Claire Winkler, owner of the Greenville, South Carolina, lo-
cation of Ten Thousand Villages, a business that sells handmade
gifts and crafts created by artisans in developing countries, op-
erates her company from a full-time location on busy Augusta 
Street. Although only two miles from Greenville’s vibrant down-
town district, the Augusta Street location rarely draws downtown 
residents and tourists. Winkler opened a pop-up Ten Thousand 
Villages store in a vacant building that once housed offices in the 
downtown district from October to December to take advantage 
of the pedestrian traffic generated by the many fall festivals and 
events the city held downtown, the area’s live performances, and
the busy holiday shopping season. In addition to generating addi-
tional sales, her goal was to expand the awareness of her Augusta 
Street location. The first weekend, the store was extremely busy.
Winkler says many of the pop-up shop’s customers were people 
who lived in Greenville but had never heard of her Augusta Street
store and its interesting collection of inventory. She considers the 
pop-up to be a huge sales—and brand awareness—success.
Even online merchants are opening pop-up stores, and 
many are finding that the opportunity to spend face-to-face time 
with customers enables them to gain valuable feedback on their 
product lines, get ideas for new products, and determine whether 
they are ready to open brick-and-mortar stores. Jon Crawford,
founder of Storenvy Inc., an online platform where small busi-
nesses can set up e-commerce stores and sell their products, part-
nered with Storefront Inc. to set up a physical store in which five of 
Storenvy’s more than 50,000 e-commerce business owners would 
operate their own real-world shops for one month. Each month, 
five new businesses move into the retail space, which is located in
downtown San Francisco. Crawford says the retail space has be-
come a type of retail incubator that allows e-commerce merchants 
to test the viability of a physical store.
When Laura Bruland, who makes unique laser-cut jewelry 
from recycled books (she ran a successful Kickstarter campaign 
to raise the money to purchase her first laser cutter), opened her 
pop-up shop, Yes & Yes Designs, in the retail space, she realized
that she needed a much bigger and bolder display for her innova-
tive designs. Her one-month experience with the physical store
gave her the confidence to start selling her jewelry successfully 
at festivals and craft fairs. Bruland, who operates the online com-
pany from her own studio in Oakland, California, with the help
of her partner, Julien Shields, and their wonder dog, Toto, also 
has benefitted from her in-depth conversations with customers,
many of whom have given her ideas for new designs and new 
products. After one customer asked about a gift for her husband, 
Bruland created a line of cufflinks. Several early participants in the 
program have gone on to create physical stores to supplement 
their online sales.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Cabela’s stores are destination stores, often drawing shoppers from 100 or more miles away.48 Busi-
nesses that offer a narrow selection of products and services tend to have smaller trading areas. For 
instance, the majority of a massage therapist’s clients live within 3 to 5 miles of the location, with a 
secondary tier of clients who live within 5 to 10 miles. Clients who are willing to travel more than 
15 minutes for a session are rare.49
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Greg Carafello: Cartridge World When Greg Carafello 
became a master franchiser for Cartridge World, an Australia-based company that sells new 
and remanufactured printer cartridges, he opened franchises in suburban New Jersey in strip 
malls located near concentrations of small businesses, which make up 95 percent of his customers.
When Carafello began opening stores in downtown Manhattan, where rental rates are much
higher, he discovered that the best locations are those on the first floor of high-rise buildings that
house at least 60 floors of business space. The high concentration of small business customers in
close proximity generates a high volume of business for his Cartridge World locations.50 ■
Retail Compatibility
Shoppers tend to be drawn to clusters of related businesses. That’s one reason shopping malls
and outlet shopping centers are popular destinations for shoppers and are attractive locations for 
retailers. The concentration of businesses pulls customers from a larger trading area than a single
freestanding business does. Retail compatibility describes the benefits a company receives by
locating near other businesses that sell complementary products and services or that generate
high volumes of foot traffic. Clever business owners choose their locations with an eye on the sur-
rounding mix of businesses. For instance, grocery store operators prefer not to locate in shopping 
centers with movie theaters, offices, and fitness centers, all businesses whose customers occupy 
parking spaces for extended time periods. Drugstores, nail salons, and ice cream parlors have 
proved to be much better shopping center neighbors for grocers.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Carol Buie-Jackson and Jay Jackson: Birdhouse on the
Greenway Carol Buie-Jackson and her husband, Jay Jackson, spent months screening potential loca-
tions for their wild bird product shop, Birdhouse on the Greenway. They chose a 1,600-square-foot
space in The Shops at Piper Glen, a shopping center on the fast-growing south side of Charlotte, North 
Carolina, which offers two prime advantages. The store is located in the middle of one of the city’s 
most affluent residential areas that contains large numbers of their target customers, people who are 
in their 50s and 60s with above-average incomes and are environmentally conscious. It also sits at the 
entrance of Four-Mile Creek Greenway, a popular walking trail that winds through natural habitat 
and has connectors to local neighborhoods. The other businesses in the shopping center complement
Birdhouse on the Greenway because they draw the same customers the Jacksons target. Trader Joe’s is
just two doors down, and other stores include Starbucks and Great Harvest Bread Company. Because of 
their wise choice of a location for their shop, the Jacksons say Birdhouse on the Green is thriving.51 ■
Degree of Competition
The size, location, and activity of competing businesses also influence the size of a company’s trad-
ing area. If a business will be the first of its kind in a location, its trading area might be quite exten-
sive. However, if the area already has 8 or 10 nearby stores that directly compete with a business, its 
trading area might be very small because the market is saturated with competitors. Market saturation 
is a problem for businesses in many industries, ranging from fast-food restaurants to convenience 
stores. Red Mango, an upscale yogurt chain based in Los Angeles, recently saw four of its franchises
in that city close because of poor location choices. The company is continuing with its expansion
plans but will focus on other cities that are less saturated with frozen yogurt shops.52
The Index of Retail Saturation
One of the best measures of the level of saturation in an area is the index of retail saturation 
(IRS), which takes into account both the number of customers and the intensity of competition in 
a trading area. The index of retail saturation is a measure of the potential sales per square foot 
of store space for a given product within a specific trading area. It is the ratio of a trading area’s
sales potential for a particular product or service to its sales capacity:
IRS = C * RE

where
C = number of customers in the trading area
RE = retail expenditures, or the average expenditure per person ($) for the product in the trading area
RF = retail facilities, or the total square feet of selling space allocated to the product in the trading area
This computation is an important one for every retailer to make. Locating in an area already 
saturated with competitors results in dismal sales volume and often leads to failure.
To illustrate the index of retail saturation, suppose an entrepreneur who is looking at two sites 
for a shoe store finds that he needs sales of $175 per square foot to be profitable. Site 1 has a trad-
ing area with 25,875 potential customers who spend an average of $42 on shoes annually; the only
competitor in the trading area has 6,000 square feet of selling space. Site 2 has 27,750 potential 
customers spending an average of $43.50 on shoes annually; two competitors occupy 8,400 square
feet of space:
Site 1

Although site 2 appears to be more favorable on the surface, the index shows that site 1 is 
preferable; site 2 fails to meet the minimum standard of $175 per square foot.
Reilly’s Law of Retail Gravitation
Reilly’s Law of Retail Gravitation, a classic work in market analysis published in 1931 by 
William J. Reilly, uses the analogy of gravity to estimate the attractiveness of a particular busi-
ness to potential customers. A business’s ability to draw customers is directly related to the extent 
to which customers see it as a “destination” and is inversely related to the distance customers 
must travel to reach it. Reilly’s model also provides a way to estimate the trade boundary between 
two market areas by calculating the “break point” between them. The break point between two 
primary market areas is the boundary between the two where customers become indifferent about 
shopping at one or the other. The key factor in determining this point of indifference is the size 
of the communities. If two nearby cities have the same population sizes, then the break point lies
halfway between them. The following is the equation for Reilly’s Law:53
BP =
d
1 + A
Pb
Pa
A
where
BP = the distance in miles from location A to the break point
d = the distance in miles between locations A and B
Pb = the population surrounding location B
Pa = the population surrounding location A
For example, if city A and city B are 22 miles apart and city A has a population of 25,500 
and city B has a population of 42,900, the break point according to Reilly’s law is
BP =
22
1 + A
42,900
25,500
A
= 9.2 miles

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
The outer edge of city A’s trading area lies about nine miles between city A and city B. 
Although only a rough estimate, this simple calculation using readily available data can be useful 
for screening potential locations.
Transportation Network
For many retail and service businesses, easy customer access from a smoothly flowing network 
of highways and roads is essential. If a location is inconvenient for customers to reach, a business
located there will suffer from a diminished trading area and lower sales. Entrepreneurs should 
verify that the transportation system works smoothly and is free of barriers that prevent custom-
ers from reaching their shopping destinations. Is it easy for customers traveling in the opposite 
direction to cross traffic? Do traffic signs and lights allow traffic to flow smoothly?
E-commerce companies also must consider accessibility to trucking routes, such as in-
terstate highways, and airports so that they can expedite customers’ orders. Zappos, the online 
shoe retailer, moved its fulfillment center to Louisville, Kentucky, so that the company can ship 
orders almost anywhere in the United States within one day. The Zappos center is located just 
12 miles from the UPS Worldport, the world’s largest automated package-sorting facility (it can 
sort 416,000 packages per hour) in the Louisville International Airport. From this airport, flights 
can reach 75 percent of the population of the United States in just 2.5 hours and 95 percent of the 
population in 4 hours. The city also has three interstate highways and two railways. Because of 
Zappos’s location, a package that leaves UPS Worldport by 12:45 a.m. can arrive at the home or 
business of any customer in the United States that same day, giving the company a competitive
edge in customer service.54
Physical and Psychological Barriers
Trading area shape and size also are influenced by physical and psychological barriers. Physi-
cal barriers may be parks, rivers, lakes, bridges, or any other natural or man-made obstruction
that hinders customers’ access to the area. Locating on one side of a large park may reduce the 
number of customers who will drive around it to get to a store. Psychological barriers include 
areas that have a reputation for crime and illegal activities. If high crime areas exist near a site, 
potential customers will not travel through them to reach a business.
Other factors retailers should consider when evaluating potential sites are discussed next.
Customer Traffic
Perhaps the most important screening criterion for a potential retail (and often for a service)
location is the number of potential customers passing by the site during business hours. To be
successful, a business must be able to generate sufficient sales to surpass its break-even point, 
and that requires an ample volume of customer traffic going past its doors. The key success fac-
tor for many retail stores is a high-volume location with easy accessibility. Entrepreneurs should 
use traffic counts (pedestrian and/or auto) and traffic pattern studies (usually available from state 
highway departments) to confirm that the sites they are considering as potential locations are 
capable of generating sufficient sales volume.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: IHOP IHOP, the restaurant chain best known for its break-
fast offerings, recently opened an IHOP Express, a downsized version of its restaurants, in 
Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Located outside the security checkpoint in the 
Main Terminal Food Court, the 3,000-square-foot restaurant is open 24 hours a day, seven days a
week and features both sit-down and “grab-and-go” meals. The IHOP Express benefits from the
high volume of traffic created by the 90 million passengers who pass through the world’s busiest 
airport each year and the 60,000 employees who work there. Rental rates are much higher than 
those in traditional locations, but average sales per square foot for restaurants and retailers at 
Hartsfield-Jackson are an impressive $2,215, seven times the average at a typical mall (and three
times the average at top-performing malls).55 ■
Adequate Parking
If customers cannot find convenient and safe parking, they are not likely to shop in the area. 
Many downtown areas lose customers because of inadequate parking. Although shopping

563
malls average five parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of shopping space, many central busi-
ness districts get by with 3.5 spaces (or fewer) per 1,000 square feet. In addition, some cen-
tral business districts require visitors to feed meters to pay for parking, another deterrent to
shoppers. Even when free parking is available, some potential customers may not feel safe on 
the streets, especially after dark. Some large city downtown business districts become virtual 
ghost towns at the end of the business day. A location where traffic vanishes after 6 p.m. may 
not be as valuable as mall or shopping center locations that mark the beginning of the prime 
sales time at 6 p.m.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Chris Wysocki and Robert Fulbright: Yarnhouse Chris 
Wysocki and Robert Fulbright opened Yarnhouse, a specialty knitting, crocheting, and fiber
Y
art shop in 2008 in a building on North Davidson Street located in the heart of Charlotte, North 
Carolina’s arts district (known as “NoDa”). The arts district location provided significant exposure 
and attracted a large number of the entrepreneurs’ target customers, but customers often com-
plained about the scarcity of available parking. They knew their sales were suffering because 
many customers were not willing to walk several blocks to shop at their store. Wysocki and Ful-
bright decided to move their store, but they did not go far—just a half-mile down North Davidson 
Street to a building surrounded by ample parking spaces and just three doors away from one of 
Charlotte’s most popular restaurants, Amelie’s French Bakery. Their rent actually is 20 percent
lower, customer traffic at Yarnhouse already has increased, and Wysocki says the new location is
Y
proving to be “monumental.”56 ■
Reputation
Like people, a site can have a bad reputation. Sites in which businesses have failed repeatedly 
create negative impressions in customers’ minds; many people view the business as just another 
one that soon will be gone. Sometimes previous failures are indicative of a fundamental problem 
with the location itself; in other cases, the cause of the previous failure was the result not of a 
poor location but of a poorly managed business. When entrepreneurs decide to conduct business 
in a location that has housed previous failures, it is essential that they make many highly visible
changes to the site to exorcise the “ghosts” of the failed businesses that came before them and to
give customers the perception of a company making a “fresh start.”
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: James and Julie Petrakis: The Cask and Larder When 
copreneurs James and Julie Petrakis, owners of The Ravenous Pig, a restaurant in Winter 
Park, Florida, decided to open a second restaurant, The Cask and Larder, they selected a land-
mark building only a half a mile away from their existing restaurant. Although the building was
well known to locals and was in a high-traffic location, the Petrakises had some misgivings 
about it because it had been home to five failed restaurants over the previous decade. How-
ever, the couple was able to negotiate a favorable lease and invested in a major renovation to 
erase the memory of past failures from customers’ minds. Two years later, the Cask and Larder 
is going strong with a diverse menu that includes meats cured in-house, locally sourced fresh 
seafood, homemade preserves and jams, and craft beers brewed onsite by an experienced
brewmaster.57 ■
Visibility
A final characteristic of a good location is visibility. Highly visible locations simply make it easy
for customers to find a business and make purchases. A site that lacks visibility puts a company
at a major disadvantage before it ever opens its doors for business.
Location Options for Retail and Service Businesses
There are nine basic areas where retail and service business owners can locate: the central busi-
ness district, neighborhoods, shopping centers and malls, near competitors, shared spaces, inside 
large retail stores, nontraditional locations, at home, and on the road. According to Reis Inc., 
the average cost to lease space in a shopping center is about $19 per square foot, and at malls, 
lease rates average $39 per square foot. In central business locations, the average cost is between 
$22 and $45 per square foot (rental rates vary significantly, depending on the city).58 Of course, 
cost is just one factor a business owner must consider when choosing a location.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Central Business District
The central business district (CBD) is the traditional center of town—the downtown concentra-
tion of businesses established early in the development of most towns and cities. Entrepreneurs
derive several advantages from a downtown location. Because the business is centrally located,
it attracts customers from the entire trading area of the city. In addition, a small business usually
benefits from the customer traffic generated by the other stores in the district. Many cities have 
undertaken revitalization efforts in their CBDs and have transformed these areas into thriving, 
vigorous hubs of economic activity that are proving to be ideal locations for small businesses.
However, locating in some CBDs does have certain disadvantages. Many CBDs are characterized 
by intense competition, high rental rates, traffic congestion, and inadequate parking facilities.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: David and Margaret Smith: Blowin’ in the Wind
David Smith, a fourth-generation carpenter and artist, and his wife, Margaret, moved to
Las Vegas, New Mexico (not to be confused with its casino-laden namesake in Nevada) in 2006 to 
realize David’s dream of opening a business. With a population of 14,000, Las Vegas, which was 
settled in the 1830s while still a part of Mexico, is unique in that its central business district fea-
tures an uninterrupted avenue of well-preserved commercial buildings from the late nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries that reflect a variety of styles, including Victorian, Mission Revival, 
Queen Anne, and others. More than 900 of the town’s buildings are listed on the National Regis-
ter of Historic Places, and its main street recently was named one of the top 10 Great American 
Streets. The unique architecture and intriguing colors of the buildings that line historic Bridge
Street reflect Las Vegas’s frontier history as an important hub of commercial and transportation 
activity on the famous Santa Fe Trail. The Smiths considered many different locations in the small 
town before choosing a 7,500-square-foot building at the foot of historic Bridge Street, which 
connects the “Old Town” with the “New Town,” as the site for their gallery and boutique, Blowin’ 
in the Wind, because of its large windows that allow them to feature their merchandise. The
copreneurs have filled the space with an eclectic collection of merchandise ranging from wind 
sculptures and furniture (all made by David) to jewelry and clothing.59 ■
Beginning in the 1950s, many cities saw their older downtown business districts begin to 
decay as residents moved to the suburbs and began shopping at newer, more conveniently located 
malls. Today, however, many of these CBDs are experiencing rebirth as cities restore them to 
their former splendor and shoppers return. Many customers find irresistible the charming at-
mosphere that traditional downtown districts offer with their rich mix of stores, their unique 
architecture and streetscapes, and their historic character. Cities have begun to reverse the urban 
decay of their downtown business districts through proactive revitalization programs designed 
to attract visitors and residents alike to cultural events by locating major theaters and museums 
in the downtown area. In addition, many cities are providing economic incentives to real estate 
developers to build apartment and condominium complexes in the heart of the downtown area. 
Vitality is returning as residents live and shop in the once nearly abandoned downtown areas. The 
“ghost-town” image is being replaced by both younger and older residents who love the conve-
nience, culture, and excitement of life at the city center.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Nello Gioia: Ristorante Bergamo Forbes recently 
named Greenville, South Carolina, one of America’s Best Downtowns, but 30 years ago, the 
city’s central business district was a far different place. Nello Gioia, owner of Ristorante Bergamo, 
an upscale Italian restaurant, took a chance on a downtown location on Main Street in Greenville 
in 1985 when the city was just beginning an ambitious revitalization of its central business district. 
Unlike the busy, vibrant, highly desirable location Greenville’s downtown is today, what Gioia saw 
then was a seedy-looking street spattered with offices, a few longtime resident businesses, and 
lots of shuttered and vacant stores. “The month before we opened, I got cold feet,” recalls Gioia. 
“But I was up to my neck. I had to do it.” Gioia had considered locating in a nearby regional mall
and a strip mall but decided that those locations were inconsistent with the image he wanted to 
create for his restaurant. “The one place that resembled where I came from [Bergamo, Italy] was 
downtown,” says Gioia.60 ■
Today, Gioia is glad he took the chance on a downtown location; Greenville’s central busi-
ness district, with its eclectic mix of restaurants, small shops, and cultural events, has become a

well-known success story, and many other cities across the United States are using it as a model
for reclaiming their own downtowns.
Neighborhood Locations
Small businesses that locate near residential neighborhoods rely heavily on the local trading area 
for business. Businesses that provide convenience as a major attraction for customers find that 
locating on a street or road just outside major residential areas provides the needed traffic counts 
essential for success. Gas stations and convenience stores thrive in these high-traffic areas. One
study of food stores found that the majority of the typical grocer’s customers live within a five-
mile radius. The primary advantages of a neighborhood location include relatively low operating 
rent and close contact with customers.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jodi Hamilton: Dream Dinners Jodi Hamilton, who
owns two Dream Dinners franchises, a chain that allows busy parents to assemble fast 
meals for their families using fresh, pre-prepped ingredients, selected the locations for her two 
Chicago-area outlets with her target customers in mind. Both of Hamilton’s stores are in neigh-
borhood locations, but each one is unique. Her Roscoe Village store, just north of Chicago, is 
near hundreds of single-family homes characterized by the typical suburban lifestyle. Hamilton’s 
Ukranian Village store is just four miles away but is in a more densely populated area that is 
home to a younger population with smaller families and young professionals who are not inter-
ested in cooking for themselves. The Roscoe Village store is busiest in the mornings, while the 
Ukranian Village store begins to buzz in the afternoons and is open on Sundays. Hamilton’s 
choice of locations that are convenient for her target customers has played a significant role in 
her stores’ success.61 ■
Shopping Centers and Malls
Until the early twentieth century, central business districts were the primary shopping venues 
in the United States. As cars and transportation networks became more prevalent in the 1920s,
shopping centers began popping up outside cities’ central business districts. Then in October 
1956, the nation’s first shopping mall, Southdale, opened in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, sub-
urb of Edina. Designed by Victor Gruen, the fully enclosed mall featured 72 shops anchored 
by two competing department stores (a radical concept at the time), a garden courtyard with 
a goldfish pond, an aviary, hanging plants, and artificial trees. With its multilevel layout and 
parking garage, Southdale was a huge success and forever changed the way Americans would 
shop.62 Today, shopping centers and malls are a mainstay of the American landscape. Approxi-
mately 113,000 shopping centers and 1,513 traditional enclosed malls operate in the United 
States.63 Because many different types of stores operate under one roof, shopping centers give 
meaning to the term “one-stop shopping.” In a typical month, nearly 187 million adults visit 
malls or shopping centers, generating $2.4 trillion in annual sales, an amount that represents 
more than half of all retail sales in the United States.64 There are nine types of shopping centers 
(see Table 14.5):
● Strip shopping centers. Strip shopping centers are made up of attached rows of retail 
stores or service outlets that provide local shoppers a narrow range of goods and services. 
Although they tend to be the smallest of all shopping centers with an average size of 
13,375 square feet of space, they make up the bulk of the centers in the United States, 
with a total count of more than 66,600.65
● Neighborhood shopping centers. The typical neighborhood shopping center is relatively 
small, containing from 3 to 12 stores and serving a population of up to 40,000 people 
who live within a 10-minute drive with a focus on convenience. The anchor store in these 
centers is usually a supermarket or a drugstore. Neighborhood shopping centers serve 
primarily the daily shopping needs of customers in the surrounding area. More than 
32,200 neighborhood shopping centers operate across the United States.66
● Community shopping centers. A community shopping center contains from 12 to 
50 stores and serves a population ranging from 40,000 to 150,000 people. The leading 
tenant often is a large department or variety store, a super-drugstore, or a supermarket.

Community shopping centers sell more clothing and other soft goods than do neighbor-
hood shopping centers. Of the eight types of shopping centers, community shopping cen-
ters take on the greatest variety of shapes, designs, and tenants. Nearly 9,500 community 
shopping centers operate across the United States.67
● Power centers. A power center combines the drawing strength of a large regional mall with 
the convenience of a neighborhood shopping center. Anchored by several large specialty

retailers, such as warehouse clubs, discount department stores, or large specialty stores, 
these centers target older, wealthier baby boomers who want selection and convenience.
In the United States, there are more than 2,000 power centers, where anchor stores usu-
ally account for 80 percent of power center space, compared with 50 percent in the typical 
community shopping center. Just as in a shopping mall, small businesses can benefit from 
the traffic generated by anchor stores, but they must choose their locations carefully so 
that they are not overshadowed by their larger neighbors. William James recently opened 
the Arms Room gun shop, which includes a shooting range, in a former Circuit City store 
in a power center in Houston, Texas. James spent $5 million to purchase and renovate the
20,000-square-foot building, a bargain compared to what it would have cost to build.68
● Theme or festival centers. Festival shopping centers employ a unifying theme that individ-
ual stores display in their decor and sometimes in the merchandise they sell. Entertainment 
is a common theme for these shopping centers, which often target tourists. Many festival 
shopping centers are located in urban areas and are housed in older, sometimes historic 
buildings that have been renovated to serve as shopping centers.
● Outlet centers. As their name suggests, outlet centers feature manufacturers’ and retailers’ 
outlet stores selling name-brand goods at a discount. Unlike most other types of shopping 
centers, outlet centers typically have no anchor stores; the discounted merchandise they 
offer draws sufficient traffic. Most outlet centers are open air and are laid out in strips or 
in clusters, creating small “villages” of shops. Nearly 350 outlet centers operate in the 
United States.69
● Lifestyle centers. Typically located near affluent residential neighborhoods where their 
target customers live, lifestyle centers are designed to look less like shopping centers and
malls and more like the busy streets in the central business districts that existed in towns 
and cities in their heyday. Occupied by many upscale national chain restaurants such as 
P. F. Chang and specialty stores such as Talbots, Coach, and many others, the 392 lifestyle
centers in the United States combine shopping convenience and entertainment ranging 
from movie theaters and open-air concerts to art galleries and people watching. The typi-
cal lifestyle center generates between $400 and $500 in sales per square foot compared to 
$370 in sales per square foot in traditional malls. The first lifestyle center, The Shops of 
Saddle Creek, opened in Germantown, Tennessee, in 1987.70
● Regional shopping malls. The regional shopping mall serves a large trading area, usually 
from 5 to 15 miles or more in all directions. These enclosed malls contain from 50 to 
100 stores and serve a population of 150,000 or more living within a 20- to 40-minute 
drive. The anchor is typically one or more major department stores with smaller specialty 
stores occupying the spaces between the anchors. In the United States, 828 regional malls 
currently are in operation.71 Apparel and accessories are the most popular items sold in
regional shopping malls.
● Superregional shopping malls. A superregional mall is similar to a regional mall but is 
bigger, containing more anchor stores and a greater variety of shops selling deeper lines 
of merchandise. Its trade area stretches up to 25 or more miles out. Currently, 685 super-
regional malls operate in the United States.72 Canada’s West Edmonton Mall, the largest 
mall in North America, with more than 800 stores and 100 restaurants, is one of the most 
famous superregional malls in the world. In addition to its abundance of retail shops, the 
mall, which draws an average of nearly 31 million visitors a year, contains an ice skating 
rink, a water park, an amusement park, an aquarium, a bungee tower, miniature golf 
courses, and a 21-screen movie complex.
Major department or mass merchandising stores serve as anchors and attract a significant 
volume of customer traffic to malls and shopping centers, allowing small businesses with their 
unique, sometimes quirky product offerings, boutique atmospheres, and marketing approaches 
to thrive in their shadows. In fact, as mall vacancy rates have climbed, mall owners are eager to 
rent space to small businesses, tenants that in the past many of them had shunned in favor of large
brand-name retailers.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John Myers: Party Palace John Myers had a successful 
but highly seasonal business renting inflatable bounce houses and other equipment for
backyard parties. His goal was to secure an indoor location, and in 2010, he rented a space that 
had once housed an Old Navy store in Aviation Mall in Queensbury, New York. Myers converted 
Y
the 18,000-square-foot space into the ideal home for the Party Palace, which hosts children’s par-
ties and offers a full line of inflatables, miniature golf, playhouses, kids’ rides, and a stuffed ani-
mal center.73 ■
When evaluating a mall or shopping center location, an entrepreneur should consider the 
following questions:
● Is there a good fit with other products and brands sold in the mall or center?
● Who are the other tenants? Which stores are the anchors that will bring people into the 
mall or center?
● Demographically, is the center a good fit for your products or services? What are its 
customer demographics?
● How much foot traffic does the mall or center generate? How much traffic passes the 
specific site you are considering?
● What is the mall’s average sales per square foot (a common metric for measuring a mall’s 
attractiveness)? The average for all malls is $370 per square foot, but one-third of malls
generate less than $300 per square foot in sales. Only 27 percent of malls generate sales 
per square foot of $535 or more.74
● How much vehicle traffic does the mall or center generate? Check its proximity to major 
population centers, the volume of tourists it draws, and the volume of drive-by freeway 
traffic. A mall or center that scores well on all three is more likely to be a winner.
● What is the mall’s vacancy rate? What is the turnover rate of its tenants?
● How much is the rent, and how is it calculated? Most mall tenants pay a base amount of 
rent plus a small percentage of their sales above a specified level.
A mall location is no guarantee of business success, however. Malls have been under pressure 
lately, especially from online retailers and fast-growing discount stores, and mall vacancy rates 
have been slow to recover from the Great Recession. Many weaker malls (known as “grayfields”) 
have closed or have been redeveloped. The basic problem is an oversupply of mall space; there 
is 23.5 square feet of mall retail space for every person in the United States!75 The last new en-
closed shopping mall opened in 2011. Another problem is that many malls are showing their age, 
requiring mall owners to remodel them, adding more restaurants, upscale movie theaters, and
supermarkets—experiences that shoppers cannot get online.76 In addition, the demographic 
makeup of an area’s shoppers often changes over time, creating a new socioeconomic customer 
base that may not be compatible with a small company’s target customer profile. As a result, many 
malls have undergone extensive renovations to transform themselves into “entertailing” destina-
tions, adding entertainment features to their existing retail space in an attempt to generate more 
traffic. For instance, in addition to its 520 retail shops and 60 restaurants, Minneapolis’s Mall of 
America, the second-largest mall in the United States (located only a few miles from Southdale, 
the nation’s first mall), includes a seven-acre Nickelodeon Universe amusement park at its center, 
the Sea Life Minnesota Aquarium, a Star Trek exhibition, a CSI Experience based on the popular 
television show, and a 14-screen movie complex in its 4.2 million square feet of space.77
Near Competitors
One of the most important factors in choosing a retail or service location is the compatibility of 
nearby stores with the retail or service customer. For example, stores selling cars, antiques, and
other shopping goods find it advantageous to locate near competitors to facilitate comparison 
shopping. Locating near competitors can be a key factor for success in those businesses selling
goods that customers shop for and compare on the basis of price, quality, color, and other factors.

CHAPTER 14 • CHOOSING THE RIGHT LOCATION AND LAYOU

Although some business owners avoid locations near direct competitors, others see locating
near rivals as an advantage. For instance, restaurateurs know that successful restaurants attract 
other restaurants, which, in turn, attract more customers. Many cities have at least one “restaurant 
row,” where restaurants cluster together; each restaurant feeds customers to the others.
Locating near competitors has its limits, however. Clustering too many businesses of a single 
type into a small area ultimately erodes their sales once the market reaches the saturation point. 
When an area becomes saturated with competitors, the shops cannibalize sales from one another,
making it difficult for any of them to be successful.
Shared Spaces
Because outstanding locations can be expensive or hard to find, some small companies are shar-
ing spaces with other small businesses, a trend known as coworking. Entrepreneurs can reduce
their rent and maintenance costs (and, therefore, their financial risk) by operating in a shared 
space. Entrepreneurs often find that sharing space with other businesses sparks creativity because
their employees have the opportunity to interact with people outside of their industries. Others 
who share space with businesses that sell complementary products often see their sales increase.
Shoe designer Rebecca Anderson, founder of Chaos & Harmony, and fashion designer Teresa 
Hodges, founder of BLAK, operated their businesses from their respective homes before team-
ing up to share a single workspace in Mt. Maunganui, New Zealand, that included enough space
for them to open a retail store, BLAKCHAOS. By sharing workspace, Anderson and Hodges not 
only lower their operating expenses but also draw inspiration from each other’s designs, enabling 
them to offer customers a complete, put-together look.78
Inside Large Retail Stores
Rather than compete against giant retailers, some small business owners are cooperating with
them, locating their businesses inside the larger company’s stores. These small companies offer 
products that the large retailers do not and benefit from the large volume of customer traffic the
large stores attract. The world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, is a host to several small businesses, in-
cluding franchisees of national chains Subway, McDonald’s, Seattle’s Best Coffee, and others.79
Nontraditional Locations
Rather than select a location and try to draw customers to it, many small businesses are dis-
covering where their customers already are and setting up locations there. These nontraditional 
locations include airports, museums, office buildings, churches, casinos, college and university 
campuses, athletic arenas, and others that offer high concentrations of potential customers. Mark 
Talarico, a successful Domino’s Pizza franchisee, recently set up interactive pizza-ordering 
kiosks (not vending machines) in high-traffic areas near residence halls on the campuses of the 
University of California Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College. Students who order 
pizzas through the kiosks receive a $1 discount.80 In many cases, nontraditional locations are 
smaller and less expensive to build but generate much more in sales per square foot than tradi-
tional, full-size stores. Daniel Mancini, who left a successful career in the apparel business to 
open a restaurant using his Italian grandmother’s meatball recipes, operates Meatball Obsession
in New York City’s Union Square neighborhood from a tiny 212-square-foot location that is barely 
bigger than a counter. Given his space limitations, Mancini keeps his menu simple, offering just 
four types of meatballs with a dozen sauces.81
Dunkin’ Donuts has more than 500 nontraditional locations out of 6,800 outlets in the United 
States, including theme parks, military bases, universities, travel centers on interstate highways,
and others. About 8,000 of Subway’s 35,000 restaurants worldwide are in nontraditional loca-
tions, including a high school in Detroit in which students operate the outlet and a church in 
Buffalo, New York; these locations account for 20 percent of the chain’s total sales. Subway also 
has an outlet on the MS Stolzenfels riverboat that cruises the Rhine River in Germany.82
Home-Based Businesses
For millions of entrepreneurs, home is where the business is, and their numbers are swelling. 
One recent study from the Small Business Administration reports that 52 percent of all small 
coworking

more small companies share 
the same space.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
companies are home based.83 Although a home-based retail business usually is not a good idea,
locating a service business at home is quite common. Many service companies do not have cus-
tomers come to their places of business, so an expensive office location is unnecessary. For 
instance, customers typically contact plumbers or exterminators by telephone, and the work is 
performed in customers’ homes.
Entrepreneurs locating their businesses at home reap several benefits. Perhaps the biggest 
benefit is the low cost of setting up the business. Most often, home-based entrepreneurs set up
shop in a spare bedroom or basement, avoiding the cost of renting, leasing, or buying a building. 
With a few basic pieces of office equipment—a computer or tablet, printer, copier, and smart 
phone—a lone entrepreneur can perform just like a major corporation.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jen Joas: UrbanHalo Jen Joas describes herself as an
accidental entrepreneur, saying that she never intended to launch a business. Instead, the 
active stay-at-home mom merely wanted a headband stylish enough to wear out but that would
stay in place during a workout without giving her a headache. After searching for the perfect 
headband with no success, Joas sat down at her sewing machine and made one. Soon other peo-
ple noticed her stylish headwear and asked her to make headbands for them. Joas realized that
she had discovered a business opportunity, started a home-based business named UrbanHalo, and 
began selling her headbands through local boutiques and salons. Joas, who continues to operate
her business from home, relies on her company’s Web site and Facebook page and attending
marathon expositions to market UrbanHalo; she recently expanded her company’s product line to 
include headbands for men and studio scarves.84 ■
Choosing a home location has certain disadvantages, however. Interruptions are more 
frequent, the refrigerator is all too handy, work is always just a few steps away, and isolation can
be a problem. Another difficulty facing some home-based entrepreneurs involves zoning laws. 
As their businesses grow and become more successful, entrepreneurs’ neighbors often begin 
to complain about the increased traffic, noise, and disruptions from deliveries, employees, and 
customers who drive through their residential neighborhoods to conduct business. Many com-
munities now face the challenge of passing updated zoning laws that reflect the reality of today’s 
home-based businesses while protecting the interests of residential home owners.
On the Road
Some entrepreneurs are finding that the best location is not a permanent location but a mobile 
business that takes products and services to its customers. Veterinarians, dentists, restaurants, 
and others are outfitting mobile units and taking their businesses on the road. Although mobile
entrepreneurs avoid the costs of building or renovating permanent locations, they must incur the 
expense of setting up their mobile businesses. They also face other obstacles, such as finding
suitable parking spaces in high-traffic areas, complaints from owners of nearby businesses, and 
securing the necessary permits to operate. Some communities welcome mobile businesses, while
others restrict them or even forbid them to operate.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Neil Parish: The Kibitz Room and Reuben on Rye Neil 
Parish, owner of the Kibitz Room, a classic Jewish delicatessen in Cherry Hill, New Jersey,
took his operation on the road after he purchased a used truck and spent $50,000 to outfit it, 
which he says is a bargain because setting up a food truck usually cost $100,000 or more. Parish
often takes the truck, which he dubbed Reuben on Rye, into neighborhoods from which he does
not typically draw customers to his restaurant. A favorite spot is in nearby Camden, near three 
courthouses, a hospital, and a college campus that are served by very few restaurants. Parish uses 
social media and his Web site to promote the truck and its daily location. Not only does Parish’s 
food truck increase his company’s sales and profits, but it also serves as a rolling advertisement for 
the Kibitz Room.85 ■
The Location Decision for Manufacturers
The criteria for the location decision for manufacturers are very different from those of retailers 
and service businesses; however, the decision can have just as much impact on the company’s
success. In some cases, a manufacturer has special needs that influence the choice of a location. 
LO4

process for manufacturers.

CHAPTER 14 • CHOOSING THE RIGHT LOCATION AND LAYOU

For instance, when one manufacturer of photographic plates and digital cameras was searching 
for a location for a new plant, it had to limit its search to those sites with a large supply of avail-
able fresh water, a necessary part of its process. In other cases, the location decision is controlled 
by zoning ordinances. If a manufacturer’s process creates offensive odors or excessive noise, it 
may be even further restricted in its choices.
The type of transportation network required dictates location of a factory in some cases.
Some manufacturers may need to locate on a railroad siding, whereas others may need only reli-
able trucking service. If raw materials are purchased by the carload for economies of scale, the
location must be convenient to a railroad siding. Bulk materials are sometimes shipped by barge 
and consequently require a facility convenient to a navigable river or lake. The added cost of 
using multiple shipping methods (e.g., rail to truck or barge to truck) can significantly increase 
shipping costs and make a location unfeasible for a manufacturer.
As fuel costs escalate, the cost of shipping finished products to customers also influences 
the location decision for many manufacturers, requiring them to open factories or warehouses 
in locations that are close to their primary markets to reduce transportation costs. Thermo-Pur 
Technologies, a small company that has developed a new stainless-steel heat exchanger core
that makes automotive radiators lighter, more efficient at transferring heat, and less expensive to 
manufacture, recently selected the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Re-
search in Greenville, South Carolina, as the location for its headquarters and first North American 
factory. Company managers considered other locations but selected Greenville because of its 
growing reputation as a knowledge center for automotive products, excellent transportation net-
work, proximity to potential customers (including BMW, Mercedes Benz, Kia, and others), cost 
of operation, and overall quality of life.86
Foreign Trade Zones
Foreign trade zones can be an attractive location for small manufacturers that engage in global 
trade and are looking to reduce or eliminate the tariffs, duties, and excise taxes they pay on
the materials and the parts they import and the goods they export. A foreign trade zone (see
Figure 14.3) is a specially designated area in or near a U.S. customs port of entry that allows resi-
dent companies to import materials and components from foreign countries; assemble, process, 
manufacture, or package them; and then ship the finished product back out while either reducing 
or eliminating completely tariffs and duties. As far as tariffs and duties are concerned, a company 
located in a foreign trade zone is treated as if it is located outside the United States. For instance, 
a maker of speakers can import components from around the world and assemble them at its 
plant located in a foreign trade zone. The company pays no duties on the components it imports 
or on the speakers it exports to other foreign markets. The only duties the manufacturer pays are 
on the speakers it sells in the United States; the duty the company pays is either on the finished
speakers or the imported component parts, whichever is less. There are 258 foreign trade zones 
and 498 subzones, which are special foreign trade zones that are established for limited purposes, 
operating in the United States. More than $730 billion worth of goods are shipped into FTZs in 
the United States annually.87

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Business Incubators
For many start-up companies, a business incubator may make the ideal initial location. A 
business incubator is an organization that combines low-cost, flexible rental space with a mul-
titude of support services for its small business residents. The primary reason for establishing an 
incubator is to enhance economic development by growing new businesses that create jobs and
diversify the local economy. An incubator’s goal is to nurture young companies during the vola-
tile start-up period and to help them survive until they are strong enough to go out on their own. 
Common sponsors of incubators include colleges or universities (32 percent), economic develop-
ment organizations (25 percent), government entities (16 percent), and others. Most incubators 
(54 percent) are “mixed use,” hosting a variety of start-up companies, followed by incubators 
that focus on technology companies (37 percent).88 Some incubators operate virtually with no 
physical presence much like a social network, providing entrepreneurs with mentoring and the 
opportunity to collaborate with other entrepreneurs.
In addition to discounted lease rates, incubators also offer tenants valuable resources, such 
as telephone systems, computers and software, high-speed Internet service, meeting and confer-
ence rooms, and sometimes management consulting services and financing contacts. Not only 
do these services save young companies money (reducing a small company’s start-up costs in 
some cases by 40 to 50 percent), but they also save them valuable time. Entrepreneurs can focus 
on getting their products and services to market faster than competitors rather than searching for 
the resources they need to build their companies. The typical incubator has entry requirements 
that prospective residents must meet. Incubators also have criteria that establish the conditions a
business must maintain to remain in the facility as well as the expectations for “graduation” into 
the business community (usually within three to five years).
More than 1,250 incubators operate across the United States (and 7,000 incubators world-
wide), up from just 12 in 1980; they house an estimated 49,000 start-up companies.89 Perhaps the 
greatest advantage of choosing to locate a start-up company in an incubator is a greater chance 
for success; according to the National Business Incubation Association, graduates from incuba-
tors have a success rate of 87 percent, and 84 percent of the companies that graduate stay in the 
local community.90
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jonni Lynch: Pie Bird Sweet and Savory Jonni Lynch, a 
mother with a full-time job at a law firm in Covington, Kentucky, started a business making 
pies from her home simply because she loved baking pies. Less than a year after starting Pie Bird 
Sweet and Savory, Lynch moved into the Northern Kentucky Kitchen Incubator where she shares 
space with other food-related small businesses, including companies that make marshmallows, 
granola, and vegan zucchini bread. Not only do the incubator tenants have access to professional 
kitchen equipment, but they also benefit from lower overhead costs and combine their purchases 
whenever possible to negotiate better discounts from vendors.91 ■
Layout and Design Considerations
Once an entrepreneur chooses the best location for his or her business, the next issue to address
is designing the proper layout for the space to maximize sales (retail) or productivity (manufac-
turing or service). Layout is the logical arrangement of the physical facilities in a business that 
contributes to efficient operations, increased productivity, and higher sales. Planning for the most 
effective and efficient layout in a business environment can produce dramatic improvements in 
a company’s operating effectiveness, efficiency, and overall performance. An attractive, effec-
tive layout can help a company’s recruiting efforts, reduce absenteeism, and improve employee 
productivity and satisfaction. The comprehensive U.S. Workplace Survey by global design firm 
Gensler reports that employees believe that the quality and the quantity of their work would 
increase by an average of 25 percent with better workplace design.92 The changing nature of 
work demands that work space design also changes. Although many jobs require the ability to 
focus on “heads-down” individual tasks, collaboration with coworkers is becoming a more sig-
nificant component of work. An effective work space must be flexible enough to accommodate 
and encourage both types of work. Increasingly, work is becoming more complex, team based,

technology dependent, and mobile; work spaces must adapt to accommodate these character-
istics. The study by Gensler concludes that top-performing companies have work spaces that 
are more effective than those of average companies, particularly for collaboration. Gensler also
reports that employees at top-performing companies spend 23 percent more time collaborating 
with their coworkers than do employees at average companies.93
The design of a company’s work space should reflect its character and culture, which is es-
pecially important for start-ups that are trying to recruit employees or attract investors. The “cube 
farms,” rows of impersonal cubicles in expansive open spaces, dominated office designs for de-
cades but are disappearing in favor of smaller work spaces that are more informal and contain 
workstations and furniture that employees can rearrange quickly and easily. Research shows that 
open offices, with their distractions and lack of privacy, actually impede employees’ productivity, 
reduce their creativity, and increase their stress levels.94 Modern, flexible work spaces encourage 
collaboration among employees, look less like a traditional office and more like a comfortable 
living room, and can be rearranged easily to accommodate different tasks, technology, and types 
of work.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook Facebook recently moved 
into its new headquarters on a 57-acre tract in Menlo Park, California, whose design en-
courages creativity, productivity, interaction, and collaboration among its more than 4,000 work-
ers. The goal is to create a headquarters that more closely resembles a college campus than a 
corporate office. Designers took out interior walls, cubicles, and private offices in the existing
building to create an open space, covered the walls with whiteboard paint, and sprinkled com-
fortable sofas and hundreds of small breakout rooms throughout the space where workers can 
conduct informal meetings and brainstorming sessions. In a tribute to Facebook’s “hacker cul-
ture,” the design features exposed beams and ductwork and plywood-covered corridors to re-
mind employees that their work is never done. Free-style artwork throughout the space signals 
the value of creativity and self-expression. The renovated building features a glass roof that pro-
vides plenty of natural light and a central courtyard with cafés, dry cleaners, a fitness center, a 
medical clinic, and other services to maximize employee convenience—even a giant, outdoor 
screen on which employees can watch movies after hours. Facebook recently announced the ad-
dition of a 494-unit housing community, Anton Menlo, that is within walking distance of its head-
quarters. Like company headquarters, the community’s layout encourages people to interact and
share ideas.95 ■
When creating a layout, managers must consider its impact on the space itself (comfort, 
flexibility, size, and ergonomics), the people who occupy it (type of work, special requirements, 
need for interaction, and tasks performed), and the technology they use (communication, Internet 
access, and equipment).96 The following factors have a significant impact on a space’s layout and 
design.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Size and Adaptability
A building must offer adequate space and be adaptable enough to accommodate a business’s daily
operations. If it is too small at the outset of operations, efficiency will suffer. A space must have 
enough room for customers’ movement, inventory, displays, storage, work areas, offices, and re-
strooms. Haphazard layouts undermine employee productivity and create organizational chaos. 
Businesses that launch in locations that are too small at the outset must make premature and costly 
moves to larger spaces, interfering with their ability to maintain a loyal customer base. Although 
entrepreneurs want spaces capable of accommodating their companies’ growth, they should avoid 
spaces that are too big because they waste valuable resources. Many businesses are reducing the 
space they allocate to office workers because technology allows some people to work from almost 
anywhere rather than from a traditional office. In the 1970s, the average amount of office space
per worker was 600 square feet; today, it is 200 square feet, and experts predict that by 2021, the 
typical employee will work in just 150 square feet of space.97 Companies are moving away from 
private offices and even cubicles to unassigned works spaces, such as communal tables or desks 
that workers share and can rearrange easily to suit the task at hand. Research shows that employ-
ees’ cubicles are unused more than 60 percent of the time and that private offices sit empty about 
80 percent of the time.98 Some entrepreneurs have done away with the concept of “the office” entirely.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jill Bluming: The Creative Type Although Jill Bluming’s
graphic design company, The Creative Type, is based in New York City, her eight employees

have no office space. Instead, her creative team, which is made up of copywriters, designers, 
illustrators, and others, work together “virtually” from their homes or wherever they are. When 
Bluming needs a conference room for a client meeting, she uses a Web-based service to rent one
by the hour. Bluming says The Creative Type is driven by flexibility rather than a particular struc-
ture, pointing out that her company’s low overhead costs give it a competitive advantage.99 ■
Construction and Appearance
Is the construction of the building sound? Having an expert look it over before buying and leasing 
the property can pay big dividends. Beyond the soundness of construction, does the building have
attractive external and internal appearances? The physical appearance of the building provides 
customers with their first impression of a business. Retailers and service providers, in particular, 
must recognize the importance of creating the proper image for their stores and how their shops’
layouts and physical facilities influence this image. A store’s external appearance contributes 
significantly to establishing its identity among its target customers. Does the building convey the 
appropriate signals to potential customers about the type of company it houses? Physical facili-
ties send important messages to customers. Should the building project an upscale image or an 
economical one? Is the atmosphere informal and relaxed or formal and businesslike?
Communicating the right signals through layout and physical facilities is an important step
in attracting a steady stream of customers. Retail consultant Paco Underhill advises merchants
to “seduce” passersby with their storefronts. “The seduction process should start a minimum of 
10 paces away,” he says.100
A store’s window display and in-store displays can be powerful selling tools if used properly. 
Often, a store’s displays are an afterthought, and many business owners neglect to change their 
displays often enough. The following tips help entrepreneurs create window displays that sell:
● Keep displays simple. Simple, uncluttered, and creative arrangements of merchandise draw 
the most attention and have the greatest impact on potential customers.
● Keep displays clean and current. Dusty, dingy displays or designs that are outdated send a 
negative message to passersby.
● Change displays frequently. Customers do not want to see the same merchandise on 
display every time they enter a store. Experts recommend changing displays at least quar-
terly, but stores selling trendy items should change their displays twice a month.
● Get expert help if necessary. Not every business owner has a knack for designing displays.
Their best bet is to hire a professional or to work with the design department at a local 
college or university.

Entrances
Entrances to a business should invite customers into a store. Wide entryways and attractive mer-
chandise displays that are set back from the doorway draw customers into a business. A store’s
entrance should catch passing customers’ attention and draw them inside. “That’s where you 
want somebody to slam on the brakes and realize they’re going someplace new,” says retail con-
sultant Paco Underhill.101 Retailers with heavy traffic flows, such as supermarkets or drugstores, 
often install automatic doors to ensure a smooth traffic flow into and out of their stores. Retailers 
must remove any barriers that interfere with customers’ easy access to the storefront. Broken 
sidewalks, sagging steps, mud puddles, and sticking or heavy doors create not only obstacles that 
might discourage potential customers but also legal hazards for a business if they cause custom-
ers to be injured. The goal is to eliminate anything that creates what one expert calls “threshold 
resistance.”102
The Americans with Disabilities Act
Approximately 12.3 percent of people in the United States are disabled.103 The Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, requires practically all businesses, regardless of their 
size, to make their facilities available to physically challenged customers and employees. Most 
states have similar laws, many of them more stringent than the ADA, that apply to small compa-
nies as well. The rules of these state laws and the ADA’s Title III are designed to ensure that men-
tally and physically challenged customers have equal access to a firm’s goods or services. For 
instance, the act requires business owners to remove architectural and communication barriers 
when “readily achievable” (accomplished without much difficulty or expense). The ADA allows 
flexibility in how a business achieves this equal access, however. For example, a restaurant could
either provide menus in Braille or offer to have a staff member read the menu to blind customers. 
A small dry cleaner might not be able to add a wheelchair ramp to its storefront without incurring 
significant expense, but the owner could comply with the ADA by offering curbside pickup and 
delivery services at no extra charge for disabled customers.
The Department of Justice revised the ADA in 2010, and all newly constructed or renovated 
buildings that are open to the public and were occupied after March 15, 2012, must comply with the 
2010 requirements. For example, in retail stores, checkout aisles must be wide enough—at least 
36 inches—to accommodate wheelchairs. Restaurants must have at least 5 percent of their tables
accessible to wheelchair-bound patrons. Miniature golf courses must make at least 50 percent 
of the holes on the course accessible to disabled customers.
Complying with the ADA does not necessarily require businesses to spend large amounts 
of money. The Department of Justice estimates that more than 20 percent of the cases customers
have filed under Title III involved changes the business owners could have made at no cost, and 
another 60 percent would have cost less than $1,000.104 In addition, companies with $1 million 
or less in annual sales or with 30 or fewer full-time employees that invest in making their loca-
tions more accessible qualify for a tax credit. The credit is 50 percent of their expenses between
$250 and $10,250. Businesses that remove physical, structural, and transportation barriers for 
disabled employees and customers also qualify for a tax deduction of up to $15,000.
Signs
One of the lowest-cost and most effective methods of communicating with customers is a busi-
ness sign. Signs serve as guideposts for a business, telling potential customers what it does, 
where it is, and what it is selling. Ideally, a sign conveys a positive image of the company’s 
brand. In a highly mobile society, a well-designed, well-placed sign can be a powerful tool for 
reaching potential customers. The Viva McDonald’s restaurant on Las Vegas Boulevard (or 
“the Strip”) includes an oversized sign and four jumbo display screens—all with video play-
back ability—mounted on the front of the store. Designers recognized that a restaurant located 
in a city known for gaudy neon light displays required a sign that would stand out to attract 
customers.105
A sign should be large enough for passersby to read from a distance, taking into consider-
ation the location and speed of surrounding traffic arteries. To be most effective, the message 
should be short, simple, and clear. Including the company’s Web site URL on the sign promotes

its e-commerce business. A sign should be legible both in daylight and at night; proper illumina-
tion is a must. Contrasting colors and simple typefaces are best. The most common problems with
business signs are that they are illegible, poorly designed (including unattractive color schemes 
and type that is hard to read), improperly located, and/or poorly maintained.
Before investing in a sign, an entrepreneur should investigate the local community’s sign 
ordinance. In some cities and towns, local regulations impose restrictions on the size, location,
height, and construction materials used in business signs.
Building Interiors
Designing a functional, efficient interior layout demands research, planning, and attention to 
detail. Retailers in particular have known for a long time that their stores’ layouts influence their 
customers’ buying behavior. Retailers such as Cabela’s, Barnes & Noble, and Starbucks use
layouts that encourage customers to linger and spend time (and money). Others, such as Lowe’s, 
Aldi, and Wal-Mart, reinforce their discount images with layouts that communicate a warehouse 
environment, often complete with pallets, to shoppers. Luxury retailers, such as Tiffany and 
Company, Coach, and Nordstrom, create opulent layouts in which their upscale customers feel 
comfortable.
Building interiors send important signals to shoppers about a business’s image, and cleanli-
ness and order are essential. In restaurants, for example, dining areas or bathrooms that are dirty 
send customers scurrying. Studies consistently show that the most common reason that custom-
ers refuse to return to a restaurant has nothing to do with food or service; it is dirty bathrooms!106
(“If the bathrooms are this bad, the kitchen must be worse.”) Because entrepreneurs are in their 
buildings every day and are focused on the “big picture,” overlooking details in the physical 
space can happen easily but can be deadly for sales. Is the carpet in need of cleaning or replace-
ment? Are displays and decorations dusty and disheveled? Would a coat of fresh paint brighten 
the space? Does clutter detract from a good first impression?
Coordinating an effective layout is not a haphazard process. Ergonomics, the science of 
adapting work and the work environment to complement employees’ strengths and to suit cus-
tomers’ needs, is an integral part of a successful design. For example, chairs, desks, and table
heights that allow people to work comfortably can help employees perform their job faster and 
more easily. Design experts claim that improved lighting, better acoustics, and proper climate 
control benefit the company as well as employees. An ergonomically designed workplace can
improve workers’ productivity significantly and reduce days lost due to injuries and accidents. 
A study for the Commission of Architecture and the Built Environment and the British Council 
for Offices reports that simple features, such as proper lighting, reduce absenteeism by 15 percent 
and increase productivity between 2.8 and 20 percent.107
Unfortunately, many businesses fail to incorporate ergonomic design principles into their 
layouts, and the result is costly worker’s compensation claims, absences from work, and lost pro-
ductivity. The good news for employers, however, is that preventing injuries, accidents, and lost 
days does not require spending thousands of dollars on ergonomically correct solutions. Most of 
t
the solutions actually are quite simple and inexpensive, ranging from installing equipment that 
eliminates workers’ repetitive motions to introducing breaks during which workers engage in 
exercises designed by occupational therapists to combat injuries.
Drive-Through Windows
For many businesses, a drive-through window adds another dimension to the concept of customer 
convenience and is a relatively inexpensive way to increase sales. In the quick-service restaurant 
business, drive-through windows are an essential design component, accounting for 70 percent 
of sales, an increase from 60 percent in 2002.108 Although drive-through windows are staples at 
quick-service restaurants, other businesses, including fast-casual restaurants, drugstores, con-
venience stores, hardware stores, and even wedding chapels benefit from them. Managers at 
fast-casual restaurant chain Panera Bread studied and tested drive-through windows for 10 years 
before introducing them throughout the chain because they did not want to diminish the dining 
experience for drive-through customers or in-store customers, who might be distracted by the
noise of a drive-through window. Panera’s strategy includes drive-throughs that are isolated from
the dining room, sufficient staff dedicated solely to serving drive-through customers, technology

work and the work envi-
ronment to complement

to support fast, accurate orders, and special packaging designed to ensure the integrity of custom-
ers’ food. Panera says sales at outlets with drive-through windows have experienced double-digit 
sales, and all new outlets include drive-through windows.109
Sight, Sound, Scent, and Lighting
Retailers can increase sales by sending important subconscious signals to customers using what 
design experts call “symbolics.” For instance, when shoppers enter a Whole Foods supermarket,
the first items they see are displays of fresh flowers. Not only are the flowers’ colors and the 
smells pleasing, but they also send a clear message to customers: “You are embarking on an 
adventure in freshness in our store—flowers, produce, meats, seafood, everything.”110 Layouts 
that engage all of customers’ senses also increase sales. Retail behavioral expert Paco Underhill, 
founder of Envirosell, a market research company, says most of customers’ unplanned purchases 
come after they touch, taste, smell, or hear something in a store. For example, stores that sell 
fresh food see sales increase if they offer free samples to customers. One study reports that of-f
fering shoppers free samples increases not only sales of the item offered but also sales of other 
products.111 Research also shows that customers are willing to pay more for products they can 
see, touch, taste, or try.112 “If somebody doesn’t try ‘em, they’re not going to buy ‘em,” quips
Underhill.113 Sight, sound, scent, and lighting are particularly important aspects of retail layout.
SIGHT A business can use colors and visual cues in its interior designs to support its brand
and image in subtle yet effective ways. At the Vermont Country Deli in Brattleboro, Vermont, 
wooden bookshelves and odd tables filled with colorful displays of jams, jellies, and desserts 
greet customers as they enter the store. The mismatched tables and shelves give the store an
authentic, down-home look, and signs such as “Life is short. Eat cookies.” entice customers
to make purchases. At Whole Foods, prices for fresh fruits and vegetables appear to be hand 
scrawled on fragments of black slate, a tradition in outdoor markets in Europe—as if a farmer 
had pulled up that morning, unloaded the produce, and posted the price before heading back 
to the farm. Some of the produce also is sprinkled with water droplets. When customers at the 
restaurant Tallulah on the Thames in Newport, Rhode Island, are seated, waiters hand them a 
rustic clipboard with a handwritten list of the daily “farm-to-table menu.”114 The subtle message
these symbolics send to customers is freshness.115
SOUND In an attempt to engage all of their customers’ senses, companies are realizing the impact 
that sound has on shoppers and are incorporating it into their layouts. Research shows that a 
business’s “soundscape” can have an impact on the length of time customers shop and the amount 
of money they spend. Background music that appeals to a company’s target customers can be an 
effective marketing tool, subtly communicating important messages about its brand to customers. 
Playlists differ depending on the company’s target customers and the mood the business wants to
create. Quaker State & Lube, a chain of 45 casual dining restaurants that feature an automotive 
theme, hired experts at Ambiance Radio to create playlists for its outlets for different parts of the
day (lunch, dinner, and late night). At peak times, Quaker State & Lube plays upbeat, fast-tempo 
music to encourage faster dining and to speed up the number of table turns.116 To reinforce its
image with its target audience, 18- to 30-year-olds who appreciate its funky, often edgy styles,
retail clothing company Urban Outfitters uses playlists that feature 
obscure, independent artists whose work is available on online 
platforms such as SoundCloud and Spotify.117 Thomas Pink, an 
upscale London-based retailer known for its branded shirts and 
ties with stores in major cities in Europe, Asia, the United States, 
and the Middle East, plays an eclectic list of songs that is designed 
to be part of customers’ interaction with the brand. The company 
worked with soundscape specialty company Mood Media to create 
a customized playlist that is far-reaching, ranging from The Beatles
and David Bowie to The Jam and the Mystery Jets, but is decidedly 
British. The company also launched a Web radio channel that 
streams its in-store playlists.118 For most retail soundscapes, one
rule is clear: Slow is good. People’s biorhythms reflect the sounds 
around them, and soothing classical music encourages shoppers to

relax and slow down, meaning that they will shop longer and spend more. Classical music also
makes shoppers feel more affluent and increases sales more than any other type of music.119
SCENT Research shows that scents can have a powerful effect in retail stores. The Sense of 
Smell Institute reports that the average human being can recognize 10,000 different odors and 
can recall scents with 65 percent accuracy after one year, a much higher recall rate than visual 
stimuli produce.120 In one experiment, when Eric Spangenberg of Washington State University
diffused a subtle scent of vanilla into the women’s department of a store and rose maroc into the 
men’s department, he discovered that sales nearly doubled. He also discovered that if he switched
the scents, sales in both departments fell well below their normal average.121 Vanilla connotes 
warmth and comfort, and citrus scents tend to be energizing and invigorating.
Many companies—from casinos to convenience stores—are beginning to understand the 
power of using scent as a sales tool. Bakeries use fans to push the smell of fresh-baked breads 
and sweets into pedestrian traffic lanes, tempting them to sample some of their delectable good-
ies. Panera Bread, a chain of 1,800 restaurants in 45 states, recently switched bread-baking in its 
stores from the night shift to the day shift so that customers could smell the enticing aroma of 
freshly baked bread (and watch the bakers at work). Cinnabon, a chain of franchised restaurants 
located mainly in shopping malls that specialize in fresh cinnamon buns, locates its ovens in the
front of its stores so that the delectable smell of baking cinnamon buns can draw in customers.122
Select Comfort, the company that markets the Sleep Number mattress in 400 stores across the
United States, worked with ScentAir, a company that designs scents for retailers, to infuse its 
retail outlets with a blend of cashmere wool, amber, cardamom, cinnamon, and bergamot that 
conveys a sense of “quiet repose.”123
LIGHTING Good lighting allows employees to work at maximum efficiency. Proper lighting
is measured by the amount of light required to do a job properly with the greatest lighting
efficiency. Efficiency is essential because lighting consumes 21 percent of the total energy
used in the typical commercial building.124 Traditional incandescent lighting, which Congress 
banned on January 1, 2014, is least efficient. Only 10 percent of the energy it generates is light; 
the remaining 90 percent is heat. Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) generate far less heat, use 
75 percent less energy, and last 10 times longer than traditional incandescent lights. Technology 
advances are increasing the popularity of light-emitting-diode (LED) lighting. Although still
more expensive to purchase, LEDs use just 20 percent of the electricity of incandescent lights 
and 50 percent of CFLs. They also last six times longer than CFLs and 25 times longer than 
incandescent lights. LEDs generate the least amount of heat, reducing business’s cooling 
costs.125 Joseph Banker, owner of Creative Dental Care, a boutique dental practice in Westfield, 
New Jersey, invested $700 to switch his entire lighting system to LEDs. Because LEDs are 
more efficient and burn much cooler than incandescent and CFL bulbs, Banker’s cooling bill
decreased, saving him $1,800 in the first year.126
Lighting provides a good return on investment given its overall impact on a business. 
Few people seek out businesses that are dimly lit because they convey an image of untrust-
worthiness. Layouts that use natural light not only are less expensive to operate but also give 
businesses an open and cheerful look and actually can boost sales. A series of studies by energy 
research firm Heschong Mahone Group found that stores using natural light experience sales 
that are 40 percent higher than those of similar stores using fluorescent lighting.127 In a retail 
environment, proper lighting should highlight featured products and encourage customers to 
stop and look at them.
Sustainability and Environmentally Friendly Design
Businesses are designing their buildings in more environmentally friendly ways not only be-
cause it is the right thing to do but also because it saves money. Companies are using recycled
materials; installing high-efficiency lighting, fixtures, and appliances; and using Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) principles in construction and renovation. LEED
principles cover every phase of construction and include concepts ranging from installing self-
contained, solar-powered energy sources and water-conserving plumbing fixtures to collecting 
rainwater for use in landscape irrigation to using renewable and recycled construction materials.

Starbucks, the popular chain of coffee shops, built its lat-
est roasting plant in Sandy Run, South Carolina, to LEED 
standards and has built several LEED-certified outlets out of 
old shipping containers that otherwise would have gone to a 
landfill. Some of these outlets are micro drive-throughs. At 
just 380 square feet, they are the smallest Starbucks stores in
existence, but they allow the company to access high-traffic 
locations that otherwise would be out of reach and can be 
operating in just one week. Other outlets are larger, made of 
several shipping containers connected to or stacked on top of 
one another. Each “recycled” outlet contains all of amenities 
of a “regular” Starbucks store and is decorated to reflect the 
local character of each location. The company plans to build
more “green” outlets in the future.128
Layout: Maximizing Revenues,  
Increasing Efficiency, or Reducing Costs
The ideal layout for a building depends on the type of business it houses and on the entrepre-
neur’s strategy for gaining a competitive edge. An effective layout can reinforce a brand and
contribute to a company’s desired image.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John Kunkel: Lime Fresh Mexican Grill John Kunkel, 
founder of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill, a small chain of casual burrito restaurants that Ruby 
Tuesday recently purchased, was repulsed by the hard plastic interiors of other quick-service
Mexican restaurants. He contends that the design sends a clear signal to customers: “Finish your
food quickly and make room for the next customer.” Instead, Kunkel wanted to create a comfort-
able, welcoming environment that supported his company’s image. He says he took cues from
Starbucks and tried to make a Lime Fresh Mexican Grill a social place where people can come to 
hang out. A large tub filled with ice and bottled beverages sits on a countertop, reminding cus-
tomers of a friendly backyard cookout. Large windows that diffuse natural light, golden-toned 
walls, warm hammered-copper and brick accents, and comfortable chairs invite customers to lin-
ger inside, and umbrella-covered sidewalk tables beckon hungry customers to sit and relax. Dining 
room attendants called “fronters” greet customers and provide café-style service, delivering bev-
erage refills, chips, salsas, and desserts.129 ■
Retailers design their layouts with the goal of maximizing sales revenue and reinforcing the 
brand; manufacturers see layout as an opportunity to increase efficiency and productivity and to 
lower costs.
Layout for Retailers
Retail layout is the arrangement of merchandise and displays in a store. For retailers, layout is all 
about understanding a company’s target customers and crafting every element of a store’s design 
to appeal to those customers. Retail expert Paco Underhill says “a store’s interior architecture is 
fundamental to the customers’ experience—the stage upon which a retail company functions.”130
A retail layout should pull customers into the store and make it easy for them to locate merchan-
dise; compare price, quality, and features; and ultimately make a purchase. This is another area in 
which small stores may have an advantage over their larger rivals. Small stores allow customers 
to find the products that they want to purchase quickly and easily. (One study reports that the 
average shopper in a cavernous Wal-Mart Supercenter spends 21 minutes in the store but finds 
only 7 out of 10 items on his or her shopping list!131)
In addition, a floor plan should take customers past displays of other items they may buy 
on impulse. Customers make a significant percentage of their buying decisions once they enter a 
store, meaning that the right layout can boost sales significantly. One of the most comprehensive 
studies of impulse purchases found that one-third of shoppers made impulse purchases. The me-
dian impulse purchase amount was $30 but varied by product category, ranging from $6 for food

items to $60 for jewelry and sporting goods. Although the urge to take advantage of discounts 
was the most common driver of unplanned buying decisions, the location and attractiveness of 
the display also were important factors.132
Retailers have always recognized that some locations within a store are superior to others. 
Customer traffic patterns give the owner a clue to the best location for the highest gross margin 
items. Generally, prime selling space should be reserved for products that carry the highest mark-
ups. If customers come into the store for specific products and have a tendency to walk directly 
to those items, placing complementary products in their path boosts sales. Diane Holtz, CEO of 
Pet Supermarket, a retailer of pet supplies founded in 1962 with 124 locations in the Southeast, 
redesigned the layout of the company’s stores, placing essential items such as pet food and kitty
litter at the rear of the store to draw customers past attractive displays of pet toys, treats, and
supplies. The new design features a clean, colorful look with space to feature new products each 
week and to encourage interaction with pets and their owners. One year after the redesign, the 
company’s sales had increased almost 16 percent.133
As the world shifts to a knowledge-based economy, more work-
ers are engaging in office work, in which measuring productivity 
sometimes proves difficult. Research shows that a well-designed 
office is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to 
increase workers’ productivity and satisfaction. For instance, if a
company builds and operates an office building, the cost of initial 
construction accounts for just 2 percent of the building’s total cost 
over 30 years. Operating expenses account for 6 percent. The re-
maining 92 percent of the total cost of operating the building over 
30 years goes to paying the salaries and benefits of the people 
who occupy the space! The implication of this research is that top-
performing companies recognize that their employees account for
the largest portion of the total cost of a work environment and 
make adequate investments to ensure that the work space maxi-
mizes their efficiency, satisfaction, and productivity. Unfortunately, 
many other companies remain stuck in the antiquated cubicle cul-
ture that provides the fodder for so many Dilbert cartoon strips
and that squelches individual expression, collaboration with col-
leagues, and creativity.
In the early to mid-twentieth century, companies used of-
fice layouts that resembled factory layouts with workers sitting
in long rows performing repetitive tasks. The layout reflected
management’s attitude that workers were simply parts in the
company machinery. In the 1960s and 1970s, the landscape 
office emerged, featuring a design in which managers and their 
staffs sat together so that they could accomplish related tasks 
efficiently. In the 1980s, as real estate prices escalated, compa-
nies used cubicles as an efficient way to pack lots of workers into
a limited amount of space, giving cubicles the reputation of hous-
ing employees in the same way that a hive houses bees. Today, 
office designs reflect the changing nature of work: small teams 
of employees collaborate on projects, and creativity improves
when employees from different parts of the company exchange 
ideas as a result of impromptu encounters. Modern offices 
employ furniture, features, and designs that are more flexible, 
allowing employees to shift them according to the tasks they
need to perform.
At Big Spaceship, a creative agency in Brooklyn, New York, 
the design includes open spaces to which employees are natu-
rally drawn and that encourage collaboration. Walls are covered 
in whiteboard paint and markers are everywhere so that employ-
ees can sketch their ideas while working together. It also includes 
private and semi-private rooms with couches and beanbag chairs 
to which people can escape when they need a quiet space in
which to work. Cross-disciplinary teams sit along with their backs 
to aisles so that they can concentrate on a project or simply spin 
their chairs around to collaborate with colleagues. The goal of Big
Spaceship’s layout is to encourage collaboration, stimulate creativ-
ity, and capture as many ideas as possible.
What principles make for a good office design and allow a
company to get the most out of its investment in designing a
work space?
Observe How Employees Use the Existing Space
The nature of employees’ work changes over time, and so do their
work space needs. A design that was suitable a few years ago 
may be inappropriate today. Entrepreneurs should take the time to 
observe employees at work. When do workers use office space? 
Which spaces are at maximum capacity, and which ones are un-
derutilized? Why? Does the existing design support employees’ 
ability to do their jobs or hinder it? Red flags include the following:
•
People whose work requires collaboration do not naturally 
interact with their colleagues during the course of a day.
•
Employees waste a lot of time in transit to meeting rooms, 
printers, copiers, and other office equipment.
•
Workers are competing for the use of certain pieces of 
office equipment.
•
An area is either typically overcrowded or empty.
•
Employees schedule meetings at nearby coffee shops or 
restaurants because these places provide better common 
space for collaboration.
Hands On . . . How To
Create the Ideal Layout

581
Involve Employees in the Redesign
One of the worst mistakes designers make is creating a new layout 
without the input of the people who will be working in the space. 
Asking employees up front for ideas and suggestions is essential 
to producing an effective layout. What barriers to their work does
the existing design create? How can you eliminate them? One 
surefire way to alienate employees is to fail to involve them in the 
redesign of their work space.
Plan the New Design
Redesigning a work space can be a major undertaking. The pro-
cess goes much more smoothly, and the end result is superior for
companies that invest in significant planning than for those com-
panies that do not. Successful designs usually result when entre-
preneurs and their employees define two to five priorities, such as 
increased collaboration, enhanced productivity, reduced absentee-
ism and turnover, or improved energy efficiency, for design profes-
sionals to achieve.
Creating an effective design does not have to be expensive, 
but it does demand a good plan. An extensive report, Innovative 
Workplace Strategies, from the General Services Administration, 
lists the following hallmarks of the productive workplace:
•
Spatial equity. Do workers have adequate space to accom-
plish their tasks and have access to privacy, natural light, 
and aesthetics?
•
Healthfulness. Is the work space a healthy environment 
with access to air, light, and water? Is it free of harmful 
contaminants and excess noise?
•
Flexibility. Can workers adjust their work environment to 
respond to important functional changes?
•
Comfort. Can workers adjust light, temperature, acoustic 
levels, and furnishings to their individual preferences?
•
Technological connectivity. Can on-site and off-site work-
ers stay connected with one another and gain access to the 
information they need? Does technology enhance their 
ability to collaborate on projects?
•
Reliability. Does the workplace have dependable mechani-
cal and technological systems that receive proper support?
•
Sense of place. Does the workplace decor and atmosphere 
reflect the company’s mission and brand? Does the space
create a culture that is appropriate for accomplishing the 
tasks at hand?
At OpenTable, the restaurant reservation site based in San
Francisco, the design reflects the company’s food-centric cul-
ture. The lobby doubles as a large break room and includes a 
wall filled with employees’ quotations about their favorite res-
taurant experiences. A “menu of the day” chalkboard invites
employees to share creative ideas. Conference rooms, which 
carry names such as “Food Truck” and “Buffet,” feature flex-
ible designs that employees adjust to suit their needs. Compar-
ing the company’s new space to its previous headquarters, one 
manager says the new space reflects OpenTable’s culture and 
encourages employee interaction, which has enhanced creativity 
in the company.
Create a Design That Helps People 
Get Their Work Done
A work space should never impede employees’ productivity—
r
although many designs do. A proper layout should enhance
employees’ ability to do their jobs. At animated film company 
Pixar, the work space, which includes large open areas with large 
couches and high-top tables that encourage impromptu meet-
ings, is designed to encourage collaboration among employees. 
Even the company’s volleyball and basketball courts encourage 
employee interaction, making Pixar headquarters a haven of cre-
ativity. However, recognizing that sometimes employees must
work “heads down” without interruption, Pixar also created more
private, quiet spaces.
Rely on Continuous Improvement
A redesign project is not finished just because the work is com-
plete. Smart entrepreneurs resist the temptation to sit back and 
admire the finished product and think about how happy they are 
to be “done.” Instead, they recognize that no redesign, however 
well planned, is perfect. They are willing to tweak the project
and to make necessary adjustments to meet employees’ chang-
ing needs.

Hands On . . . How To (continued)
Layout in a retail store evolves from a clear understanding of customers’ buying habits. 
Observing customer behavior helps entrepreneurs identify “hot spots” where merchan-
dise sells briskly and “cold spots” where it may languish indefinitely. Winn-Dixie stores, a 
supermarket chain, recently remodeled its stores to capitalize on its primary hot spot, the 
front section of the store to the right of the front door. Because market research shows that 
produce is the most important factor in choosing a grocery store and winning customer loyalty, 
Winn-Dixie located its produce section there and expanded it by 30 percent. Bananas, one of 

582
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
the most commonly purchased produce items, are located at the back of the section to draw cus-
tomers through it. Produce displays also use wood shelves, carts, and display tables as symbolics 
to send a message of freshness.134
Business owners should display merchandise as neatly and attractively as possible. Custom-
ers’ eyes focus on displays, which tell them the type of merchandise the business sells. It is easier 
for customers to relate to one display than to a rack or shelf of merchandise. Open displays of 
merchandise can surround a focal display, creating an attractive selling area. Spacious aisles pro-
vide shoppers an open view of merchandise and reduce the likelihood of shoplifting. One study 
found that shoppers, especially women, are reluctant to enter narrow aisles in a store. Narrow 
aisles force customers to jostle past one another (experts call this the “butt-brush factor”), mak-
ing them extremely nervous. The same study also found that placing shopping baskets in several
areas around a store can increase sales. Seventy-five percent of shoppers who pick up a basket 
buy something, compared to just 34 percent of customers who do not pick up a basket.135
Retailers can also boost sales by displaying together items that complement each other. For 
example, displaying ties near dress shirts or handbags next to shoes often leads to multiple sales. 
Placement of items on store shelves is important, too, and store owners must keep their target 
customers in mind when stocking shelves. For example, putting hearing aid batteries on bottom 
shelves where the elderly have trouble getting to them or placing popular children’s toys on top 
shelves where little ones cannot reach them hurts sales. Retailers also must avoid wasting prime 
selling space on nonselling functions (e.g., storage, office, fitting rooms, and others). For a typi-
cal retailer, the ratio of selling to nonselling space is 80/20. Although nonselling activities are 
necessary for a successful retail operation, they should not occupy a store’s most valuable selling
space. Shoppers who use fitting rooms to try on garments make purchases 67 percent of the time, 
compared to a 10 percent purchase rate for shoppers who do not use a fitting room. Clothing 
retailer Ann Taylor recently revamped its fitting rooms, enhancing their lighting to be more flat-
tering, enlarging them to accommodate shoppers’ and their friends, and making them more like 
a shopper’s walk-in closet. The company also added displays of complementary merchandise, 
such as camisoles, underwear, and shapewear, to its fitting room areas. Many retailers place their 
nonselling departments in the rear of the building, recognizing the value of each foot of space in 
a retail store and locating their most profitable items in the best-selling areas.136
The checkout process is a particularly important ingredient in customer satisfaction and often 
ranks as a sore spot with shoppers. Research shows that shoppers tend to be impatient, willing to 
wait only about four minutes in a checkout line before becoming exasperated. One study reports 
that 43 percent of customers say long checkout lines make them less likely to shop at a store.137
Retailers are discovering that simplifying and speeding up the checkout process increases cus-
tomer convenience, lowers shoppers’ stress levels, and makes them more likely to come back.
Some retailers, including Apple, use roving clerks equipped with handheld credit card–swiping 
devices, especially during peak hours, to hasten the checkout process. Studies conclude that hav-
ing shoppers form a single line that leads to multiple cashiers results in faster checkout times than
having shoppers form multiple lines in front of multiple cashiers.138
The value of a store’s space for generating sales depends on floor location in a multistory 
building, location with respect to aisles and walkways, and proximity to entrances. Space values
decrease as the distance from the main entry-level floor increases. Selling areas on the main level 
contribute a greater portion to sales than those on other floors in the building because they offer 
greater exposure to customers than either basement or higher-level locations. Therefore, main-
level locations carry a greater share of rent than other levels.
Space values also depend on their position relative to the store entrance. Typically, the farther 
away an area is from the entrance, the lower is its value. Another consideration is that in North 
America, most shoppers turn to the right entering a store and move around it counterclockwise. 
(This apparently is culturally determined; studies of shoppers in Australia and Great Britain find 
that they turn left on entering a store.) Finally, only about one-fourth of a store’s customers will
t
go more than halfway into the store. Based on these characteristics, Figure 14.4 illustrates space 
values for a typical small store.
Retail layout is a never-ending experiment in which entrepreneurs learn what works and 
what doesn’t.

Layout for Manufacturers
Manufacturing layout decisions take into consideration the arrangement of departments, work 
stations, machines, and stock-holding points within a production facility. The objective is to ar-
range these elements to ensure a smoothly flowing, efficient, and highly productive work flow. 
Manufacturing facilities have come under increased scrutiny as companies attempt to improve 
quality, reduce inventory, and increase productivity through layouts that are integrated, flexible, 
and efficient. Facility layout has a dramatic effect on product processing, material handling, stor-
age, production volume, and quality.
FACTORS IN MANUFACTURING LAYOUT The ideal layout for a manufacturing operation depends
on several factors, including the following:
● Type of product. Product design and quality standards, whether the product is produced 
for inventory or for order, and the physical properties, such as the size of materials and 
products, special handling requirements, susceptibility to damage, and perishability.
● Type of production process. Technology used, types of materials handled, means of 
providing a service, and processing requirements in terms of number of operations 
involved and amount of interaction between departments and work centers.
● Ergonomic considerations. Ensure worker safety, avoid injuries and accidents, and 
increase productivity.
● Economic considerations. Volume of production; costs of materials, machines, work 
stations, and labor; pattern and variability of demand; and minimizing cycle time, the 
amount of time between receiving a customer’s order and delivering the finished product.
● Space availability within the facility itself. Ensure that the space will adequately meet 
current and future manufacturing needs.
TYPES OF MANUFACTURING LAYOUTS Manufacturing layouts are categorized either by the work 
flow in a plant or by the production system’s function. There are three basic types of layouts that 
manufacturers can use separately or in combination—product, process, and fixed position—and 
they are differentiated by their applicability to different conditions of manufacturing volume.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Product Layouts In a product (line) layout, a manufacturer arranges workers and equipment 
according to the sequence of operations performed on the product. Conceptually, the flow is 
an unbroken line from raw material input or customer arrival to finished goods or customer 
departure. This type of layout is applicable to rigid-flow, high-volume, continuous-process or a
mass-production operation or when the service or product is highly standardized. Automobile 
assembly plants, paper mills, and oil refineries are examples of product layouts. Product layouts 
offer the advantages of low material handling costs; simplified tasks that can be done with low-
cost, lower-skilled labor; small amounts of work-in-process inventory; and relatively simplified 
production control activities. All units are routed along the same fixed path, and scheduling 
consists primarily of setting a production rate.
Disadvantages of product layouts are their inflexibility, monotony of job tasks, high fixed 
investment in specialized equipment, and heavy interdependence of all operations. A breakdown 
in one machine or at one work station can idle the entire line. This layout also requires business
owners to duplicate many pieces of equipment in the manufacturing facility, which for a small 
firm can be cost prohibitive.
Process Layouts In a process layout, a manufacturer groups workers and equipment according 
to the general functions they perform, without regard to any particular product or customer.
Process layouts are appropriate when production runs are short, when demand shows considerable 
variation and the costs of holding finished goods inventory are high, or when the service or 
product is customized. Process layouts offer the advantages of being flexible for doing custom 
work and promoting job satisfaction by offering employees diverse and challenging tasks. Its 
disadvantages are the higher costs of materials handling, requirement of more skilled labor, lower 
productivity, and more complex production control.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: C.C. Filson C.C. Filson, a company that began supplying 
gold miners with outdoor gear in 1897, recently moved into a new 57,400-square-foot 
factory in which the company manufactures its line of durable luggage and bags. The new 
factory uses an efficient process layout that is divided into three departments, each of which 
focuses on making 10 similar types of products. Workstations are arranged so that products
flow smoothly from one to the next without having to double-back (as they did in the old, 
cramped factory). Quality manager Teresa Whittaker says making this change alone saved the
company huge amounts of time and money. In the new factory, workers use rolling carts to 
move bundles of fabric and leather to their workstations, which are equipped with special 
chairs designed for a sewing operation, rather than hauling them by hand in the old factory. 
Managers say that since moving into the new factory, employee productivity has increased by
more than 50 percent. ■
FIXED POSITION LAYOUTS In a fixed position layout, materials do not move down a line as 
in a production layout but rather, because of the weight, size, or bulk of the final product, are
assembled in one spot. In other words, workers and equipment go to the material rather than
having the material flow down a line to them. Aircraft assembly plants and shipyards typify this
kind of layout.
DESIGNING PRODUCTION LAYOUTS Two important criteria for selecting and designing a layout 
are workers’ productivity and material handling costs. An effective layout allows workers to
maximize their productivity by providing them the tools and a system for doing their jobs
properly. For example, a layout that requires a production worker to step away from the work 
area in search of the proper tool is inefficient. An effective manufacturing layout avoids what lean
manufacturing principles identify as the seven forms of waste:
● Transportation. Unnecessary movement of inventory, materials, and information
● Inventory. Carrying unnecessary inventory
● Motion. Engaging in motion that does not add value to the product or process
● Waiting. Periods of inactivity when people, materials, or information are idle

● Overproduction. Producing more than customer demand dictates
● Processing. Using tools and procedures that are inappropriate for the job
● Defects. Producing poor-quality products, which requires scrapping or reworking
material
In its newest factory in Miyagi, Japan, Toyota positioned cars on the assembly line
side by side rather than tip to tail, reducing the required length of the production line by 
35 percent and increasing worker productivity by allowing employees to walk shorter dis-
tances between cars.139
Manufacturers can lower materials handling costs by using the following principles that are 
hallmarks of a lean, efficient manufacturing layout:
● Planned materials flow pattern
● Straight-line layout where possible
● Straight, clearly marked aisles
● “Backtracking” of products kept to a minimum
● Related operations located close together
● Minimum amount of in-process inventory on hand
● Easy adjustment to changing conditions
● Minimum materials handling distances
● Minimum of manual handling of materials and products
● Ergonomically designed work centers
● Minimum distances between work stations and processes
● No unnecessary rehandling of material
● Minimum handling between operations
● Minimum storage
● Materials delivered to production employees just in time
● Materials efficiently removed from the work area
● Maximum visibility; maintain clear lines of site to spot problems and improve safety
● Orderly materials handling and storage
● Good housekeeping; minimize clutter
● Maximum flexibility
● Maximum communication
Using the principles of lean manufacturing can improve efficiency, quality, and productivity and
lower costs.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Bensonwood Homes Bensonwood Homes, a premier 
designer and builder of energy-efficient timber frame homes based in Walpole, New
Hampshire, applies “5S” principles (sort, shine, simplify, standardize, and sustain) that world-class 
automaker Toyota uses in its lean manufacturing process. (Bensonwood also added a sixth “S” 
principle, safety.) As the company’s 65 employees began to buy into the process, improvements 
quickly became apparent. Employees applied lean and 5S principles to processes for both standard 
and custom products; productivity increased by 40 percent, setup time for several machining pro-
cess decreased by 90 percent, and the company experienced dramatic reductions in costs associ-
ated with the seven forms of waste.140 ■

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Explain the stages in the location decision: 
choosing the region, the state, the city, and 
the final site.
● The location decision is one of the most impor-
tant decisions an entrepreneur will make given its
long-term effects on the company. An entrepreneur 
should look at the choice as a series of increasingly 
narrow decisions: Which region of the country? 
Which state? Which city? Which site? Choosing the 
right location requires an entrepreneur to evaluate 
potential sites with his or her target customers in 
mind. Demographic statistics are available from a 
wide variety of sources, but government agencies 
such as the Census Bureau have a wealth of detailed 
data that can guide an entrepreneur in his or her 
location decision.
2. Describe the location criteria for retail 
and service businesses.
● For retailers, the location decision is especially
crucial. Retailers must consider the size of the trade 
area, the compatibility of surrounding businesses, 
the degree of competition, the suitability of the 
surrounding transportation network, physical and 
psychological barriers, volume of customer traffic, 
adequacy of parking spots, a site’s reputation, and 
the site’s visibility.
3. Outline the location options for retail and 
service businesses: central business districts, 
neighborhoods, shopping centers and malls, 
near competitors, shared spaces, inside large 
retail stores, nontraditional locations, at home, 
and on the road.
● Retail and service businesses have nine basic
location options: central business districts; neigh-
borhoods; shopping centers and malls; near com-
petitors; shared spaces; inside large retail stores; 
nontraditional locations, such as museums, sports 
arenas, and college campuses; at home; and on the 
road.
4. Explain the site selection process for 
manufacturers.
● A manufacturer’s location decision is strongly influ-
enced by local zoning ordinances. Some areas offer 
industrial parks designed specifically to attract man-
ufacturers. Two crucial factors for most manufactur-
ers are the reliability (and the cost of transporting) 
raw materials and the quality and quantity of avail-
able labor.
● A foreign trade zone is a specially designated area 
in or near a U.S. customs port of entry that allows 
resident companies to import materials and com-
ponents from foreign countries; assemble, process, 
manufacture, or package them; and then ship the 
finished product while either reducing or eliminat-
ing tariffs and duties.
● Business incubators are locations that offer flex-
ible, low-cost rental space to their tenants as well 
as business and consulting services. Their goal is 
to nurture small companies until they are ready 
to “graduate” into the business community. Many 
government agencies and universities sponsor incu-
bator locations.
5. Describe the criteria used to analyze the 
layout and design considerations of a building, 
including the Americans with Disabilities Act.
● When evaluating the suitability of a particular build-
ing, an entrepreneur should consider several factors: 
size (Is it large enough to accommodate the busi-
ness with some room for growth?), construction 
and external appearance (Is the building structurally 
sound, and does it create the right impression for the 
business?), entrances (Are they inviting?), legal is-
sues (Does the building comply with the Americans
with Disabilities Act? If not, how much will it cost to 
bring it up to standard?), signs (Are they legible, well 
located, and easy to see?), interior (Does the interior 
design contribute to our ability to make sales? Is it 
ergonomically designed?), and lights and fixtures (Is 
the lighting adequate for the tasks workers will be 
performing? What is the estimated cost of lighting?).
6. Explain the principles of effective layouts 
for retailers, service businesses, and 
manufacturers.
● Layout for retail stores and service businesses
depends on the owner’s understanding of his or her 
customers’ buying habits. Some areas of a retail 
store generate more sales per square foot and there-
fore are more valuable.
● The goal of a manufacturer’s layout is to create a 
smooth, efficient work flow. Three basic options 
exist: product layout, process layout, and fixed 
position layout. Two key considerations are worker 
productivity and materials handling costs.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Until recently, the world of international business was much like astronomy before Copernicus, 
who revolutionized the study of the planets and the stars with his theory of planetary motion. In 
the sixteenth century, the Copernican system replaced the Ptolemaic system, which held that the 
earth was the center of the universe with the sun and all the other planets revolving around it. 
The Copernican system, however, placed the sun at the center of the solar system with all of the 
planets revolving around it. Astronomy would never be the same.
In the same sense, business owners across the globe have been guilty of having Ptolemaic tun-
nel vision when it came to viewing international business opportunities. Like their pre-Copernican 
counterparts, owners saw an economy that revolved around the nations that served as their home 
bases. Market opportunities stopped at their homeland’s borders, and global trade was only for giant 
corporations. American small businesses lag behind their counterparts in most countries around the 
globe when it comes to exporting. Only 3.9 percent of U.S. small businesses engage in exporting.
In contrast, an average of 8 percent of small and medium enterprises in the European Union engage
in exporting. Estonia, Slovenia. and Finland have about 20 percent of small and medium businesses
engaging in exporting.1 The most common barriers keeping U.S. small businesses from exporting 
are regulations, rising and unpredictable transportation costs, tariff and other trade barriers, time-
consuming foreign customs procedures, language and cultural differences, and lack of knowledge 
of foreign markets.2 The majority of small businesses in the United States are content to focus on 
the domestic market. However, 95 percent of the world population lives outside of the U.S borders!
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Ron Ward: Western Forms Western Forms, a family-
owned business in Kansas City, Missouri, that manufactures forms for pouring concrete for 
the construction industry, exports to more than 30 countries. The company’s initial foray into 
global markets was modest, tapping Canada and Mexico, the closest international markets geo-
graphically. CEO Ron Ward says that customers in Canada and Mexico now account for more than 
half of Western Forms’s sales.3 ■
Today, the global marketplace is as much the territory of small upstart companies as it is 
that of giant multinational corporations. The world market for goods and services continues to 
grow, fueled by a global economy that welcomes consumers with new wealth. By 2025, more 
than 1 billion people globally will join the ranks of middle-class consumers, creating a tremen-
dous opportunity for small businesses.4 Powerful, affordable technology; the Internet; increased 
access to information on conducting global business; and the growing interdependence of the 
world’s economies have made it easier for small companies, many of which had never considered 
going global, to engage in international trade. These micromultinational companies are proving 
that even the smallest companies can succeed in the global marketplace.
As globalization transforms entire industries, even experienced business owners and manag-
ers must rethink the rules of competition on which they have relied for years. To thrive, they must 
develop new business models and new sources of competitive advantages and be bold enough 
to seize the opportunities that the global marketplace offers. Opportunities for global trade can 
come from anywhere. Many small businesses focus on markets that are nearby and/or share a 
common language, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. However, entrepre-
neurs also should pay attention to the top emerging markets, which include China, South Korea,
Malaysia, Chili, Thailand, Panama, Peru, Latvia, Poland, and Czech Republic.5
Entrepreneurs are discovering that the tools of global business are within their reach, the costs 
of going global are decreasing, and the benefits of conducting global business can be substantial.
Nearly 67 percent of the world’s purchasing power lies outside the borders of the United States!6 By
2020, global middle-class consumption will increase from $21 trillion to $35 trillion, with more than 
80 percent of that growth occurring outside of North America and Europe.7 Worldwide, countries 
trade nearly $18 trillion in goods and services annually, a dramatic increase from $58 billion in 1948.8
There has never been a better time for small companies to become players in the global marketplace.
Why Go Global?
Failure to cultivate global markets can be a lethal mistake for modern businesses, whatever their 
size. A few decades ago, small companies had to concern themselves mainly with competi-
tors who were perhaps six blocks away; today, small companies face fierce competition from

companies that may be six time zones away! As a result, entrepreneurs find themselves under 
greater pressure to expand into international markets and to build businesses without borders. 
Today, the potential for doing business globally for companies of all sizes means that where 
a business’s goods and services originate or where its headquarters is located is insignificant.
Operating a successful business increasingly requires entrepreneurs to see their companies as
global citizens rather than as companies based in a particular geographic region. For small com-
panies around the world, going global is a matter of survival, not preference. To be successful, 
small companies must take their place in the world market. Unfortunately, most small companies 
follow a reactive approach to going global (engaging in global sales because foreign customers 
initiate the contact) rather than pursue a proactive global sales strategy that involves researching
and analyzing foreign markets that represent the best fit for their products and services.9
Going global can put a tremendous strain on a small company, but entrepreneurs who take 
the plunge into global business can reap many benefits, including the ability to offset sales de-
clines in the domestic market, increase sales and profits, improve the quality of their products to 
meet the stringent demands of foreign customers, lower the manufacturing cost of their products 
by spreading fixed costs over a larger number of units, and enhance their competitive positions to 
become stronger businesses. In fact, companies that sell their goods and services in other coun-
tries generate more sales revenue, are more profitable, have higher levels of productivity, and are 
less likely to fail than those that limit their sales to the domestic market.10
Success in a global economy requires constant innovation; staying nimble enough to use 
speed as a competitive weapon; maintaining a high level of quality and constantly improving it; 
being sensitive to foreign customers’ unique requirements; adopting a more respectful attitude 
toward foreign habits and customs; hiring motivated, multilingual employees; and retaining a 
desire to learn constantly about global markets. In short, business owners must strive to become
“insiders” rather than just “exporters.”
Becoming a global entrepreneur requires a different mindset. To be successful, entrepreneurs 
must see their companies from a global perspective and must instill a global culture through-
out their companies that permeates everything the business does. To these entrepreneurs and 
their companies, national boundaries are irrelevant; they see the world as a market opportunity. 
An absence of global thinking is one of the barriers that most often limit entrepreneurs’ ability 
to move beyond the domestic market. Indeed, learning to think globally may be the first—and

most challenging—obstacle an entrepreneur must overcome on the way to creating a truly global 
business. Global thinking is the ability to appreciate, understand, and respect the different be-
liefs, values, behavior, and business practices of companies and people in different cultures and 
countries. This requires entrepreneurs to “do their homework” to learn about the people, places, 
business techniques, potential customers, and culture of the countries in which they intend to 
do business. Several U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Commerce, offer 
vast amounts of information about all nations, including economic data that can be useful to en-
trepreneurs searching for market opportunities. Doing business globally presents extraordinary
opportunities only to those who are prepared.
Strategies for Going Global
Small companies pursuing a global presence have 10 principal strategies from which to choose: cre-
ating a presence on the Web, relying on trade intermediaries, establishing joint ventures, engaging 
in foreign licensing arrangements, franchising, using countertrading and bartering, exporting prod-
ucts or services, establishing international locations, importing and outsourcing, and becoming an
expat entrepreneur (see Figure 15.1).
CREATING A WEB SITE In our technology-rich global environment, the fastest, least expensive,
and lowest-cost strategic option to establish a global business presence is to create a Web site.
As you saw in Chapter 9 on e-commerce, the Internet gives even the smallest business the ability
to sell its goods and services all over the globe. By establishing a presence online, a local candy 
maker or a home-based luxury boat broker gains immediate access to customers around the 
world. With a well-designed Web site, an entrepreneur can extend his or her reach to customers 
anywhere in the world—without breaking the budget! A company’s Web site is available to 
potential customers everywhere and provides exposure to its products or services 24 hours a day 
seven days a week. For many small companies, the Internet has become a tool that is as essential
to doing business as the telephone.
Establishing an Internet presence has become an important part of many small companies’
strategies for reaching customers outside the United States. Internet World Stats estimates the
number of Internet users worldwide to be 2.4 billion. Just 273 million of them live in the United 
States, leaving more than 2 billion potential Internet customers outside this country’s borders (see 
Figure 15.2)!11 A study by the World Retail Congress reports that 23 percent of global retail sales 
will take place online by 2015.12
Just as business owners who conduct international business in person must be sensitive to 
the cultural nuances and differences in the business practices of other countries, entrepreneurs 
who conduct business online must take these same factors into account when they design their 
companies’ Web sites. Entrepreneurs must “think local” when they create Web sites that target 
customers in other countries. Although having a single domain name with separate “language”

buttons for translations is simpler and less expensive, e-commerce experts say having separate
domain names for each targeted country produces better sales results. The design of Web sites
that target foreign customers must reflect the local culture, customs, and language. For instance, 
not all cultures read from left to right, and colors that may be appropriate in one culture may 
be offensive to customers in another. A U.S. entrepreneur won’t have much luck listing “soccer 
cleats” for sale on a Web site aimed at customers in the United Kingdom, where customers would 
search for “football boots.” Although there are online tools to help translate keywords and Web 
site content into multiple languages, the subtleties of language and culture require getting help 
from people with specific expertise in a new market.
Before the advent of the Internet, small businesses usually took incremental steps toward
becoming global businesses. They began selling locally and then, after establishing a reputation,
expanded regionally and perhaps nationally. Only after establishing themselves domestically did 
small businesses begin to think about selling their products or services internationally. The In-
ternet makes that business model obsolete because it provides small companies with a low-cost 
global distribution channel that they can use from the day they are launched.
TRADE INTERMEDIARIES Although many small businesses handle their foreign sales efforts in-
house, another alternative for getting into international markets with a minimum of cost and 
effort is to use a trade intermediary. Trade intermediaries are domestic agencies that serve as
distributors in foreign countries for domestic companies of all sizes. They rely on their networks 
of contacts, their extensive knowledge of local customs and markets, and their experience in 
international trade to market products effectively and efficiently all across the globe. These trade
intermediaries serve as the export departments for small businesses, enabling the small companies
to focus on what they do best and delegate the responsibility for coordinating foreign sales efforts
to the intermediaries. They are especially valuable to small companies that are getting started 
in the global arena, often producing benefits that far outweigh their costs. Lawrence Harding,
president of High Street Partners, a trade intermediary that manages foreign sales for small
companies, points to the example of a company that imported telecommunications equipment into 
the United Kingdom to sell to its customers there. The deal triggered a hefty 17.5 percent duty 
that Harding says the company could have avoided paying if it had imported the equipment in a 
different way.13
Although a broad array of trade intermediaries is available, the following are ideally suited 
for small businesses.
Export Management Companies Export management companies (EMCs) are an important 
channel of foreign distribution for small companies just getting started in international trade 
or for those that lack the resources to assign their own people to foreign markets. Most EMCs 
are merchant intermediaries, working on a buy-and-sell arrangement with domestic small

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Entrepreneurs are discovering that doing business globally is not 
just for large corporations. Some entrepreneurs take their com-
panies global from the outset, and their micro-multinational 
companies are reaping the benefits.
Zee Wines USA
Roy Goslin and his wife, Dianne Ferrandi, grew up in South Africa, 
where both had connections to that country’s wine industry. 
Ferrandi’s parents owned vineyards and sold grapes to local vintners, 
and Goslin worked in materials and process management for one 
of South Africa’s largest wineries. Both Goslin and Ferrandi grew 
up with wine as an integral part of meals. In 1998, recruited by a 
large information technology consulting firm, the couple moved to
Minneapolis, Minnesota, but they never lost their passion for the 
fine wines of South Africa. Because few people in the United States
knew about the storied winemaking tradition and superb vineyards 
of South Africa, Goslin and Ferrandi had difficulty finding wines
from their homeland in Minnesota. Their solution: start their own
wine import business that specializes in wines from South Africa.
They announced their decision at a dinner with friends, where one 
friend suggested that they name their company “Z Wines.” (You’ve 
got zee food, and we have zee wine,” he joked.)
In 2006, Goslin and Ferrandi started Zee Wines USA as
a home-based business with the goal of importing wines from 
South Africa that they knew were the best the country had to of-
fer and wholesaling them to retail stores. Many of the wineries the 
company buys from have been operating for hundreds of years. 
With its diverse climate, rich soil, amazing biodiversity, and rich 
winemaking tradition, South Africa produces some of the world’s
finest, most distinctive wines. The couple knew they could import 
wines from South Africa and sell them for just $10 to $15 per 
bottle in the United States.
In addition to the South African wines they import, Goslin 
and Ferrandi also sell domestic wines from Washington, Oregon, 
and California. With $500,000 in annual sales, their total portfolio 
of wines numbers only about 100. Although the owners could 
have pursued a more aggressive growth strategy, they chose to fo-
cus on wines that fit their business model of providing high value 
for their customers. The company only accepts 1 to 2 percent of 
the wines its owners evaluate.
Somnio
When Sean Sullivan was an executive at The North Face and Spe-
cialized Bicycle Components, he noticed that international sales
accounted for the majority of sales in some product categories. 
Learning from his corporate experience, Sullivan decided that when 
he launched his own company, he would operate it as a global
business from the start. Sullivan, an avid runner, came up with the
idea for his business after visiting his doctor, Andy Pruitt, founder 
of the Boulder Center for Sports Medicine in Boulder, Colorado, for 
treatment for chronic foot pain. Pruitt told Sullivan that his running 
shoes were the cause of his foot problem, and the two worked to-
gether to design a better running shoe using biomechanics, custom 
padding, and inserts to create customized shoes that accommo-
date runners’ foot shape and running style. For instance, they de-
veloped insoles that are tailored to fit each customer’s arch height.
They launched Somnio in 2009 and immediately began developing 
strategies to sell their running shoes in Europe and Asia.
After a four-month search, Sullivan hired Saskia Stock, who 
had been in charge of biomechanical research at MBT Shoes, a
Swiss footwear maker, to manage Somnio’s European division in 
Zurich, Switzerland. The reason that Sullivan wanted a veteran of
the shoe industry to manage the company’s European operations
was to enable Somnio to enter into direct sales relationships with 
retailers rather than sell through foreign distributors. Sullivan is 
concerned that selling through distributors will cost him too much 
over the long run. When Somnio entered Asian markets, however, 
Sullivan opted to use foreign distributors there because they had 
established connections that would take Somnio years to develop 
and understood the nuances of doing business locally.
Somnio, which is headquartered in La Selva Beach, 
California, manufactures its running shoes in China and sells them 
in 20 countries, throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The 
company generates $10 million in annual sales, more than half of 
which comes from Europe.

expanding into other markets. What are the implications for 
small companies that have the potential to conduct business 
globally?
2. What advice can you offer the founders of Zee Wine USA 
about selling their products globally?
3. Notice that Sean Sullivan used a direct sales approach to 
enter the European market but relied on foreign distribu-
tors in the Asian market. What are the advantages and the 
disadvantages of each approach? Why do most small com-
panies that sell internationally use trade intermediaries?

companies, taking title to the goods and then reselling them in foreign markets; others work 
on commission. More than 1,000 EMCs operate across the United States, and many of them 
specialize in particular industries, products, or product lines as well as in the foreign countries 
they target. For instance, Dorian Drake International, an EMC started in 1947, specializes in 
selling equipment around the world for U.S.-based companies in four industries—automotive, 
food service, lawn and garden, and environmental. For more than 40 years, Dorian Drake has 
managed global sales for American Lawn, the leading U.S. maker of manual reel lawn mowers, 
a family-owned business founded in Shelbyville, Indiana, in 1895.14
EMCs provide small businesses with a low-cost, efficient, independent international market-
ing and export department, offering services that range from conducting market research and
giving advice on patent protection to arranging financing and handling shipping. The greatest 
benefits that EMCs offer small companies are ready access to global markets and an extensive 
knowledge base on foreign trade, both of which are vital for entrepreneurs who are inexperi-
enced in conducting global business. In return for their services, EMCs usually earn an extra 
discount on the goods they buy from their clients or, if they operate on a commission rate, a 
higher commission than domestic distributors earn on what they sell. EMCs charge commission
rates of about 10 percent on consumer goods and 15 percent on industrial products. Although 
EMCs rarely advertise their services, finding one is not difficult. The Federation of International 
Trade Associations provides useful information for small companies about global business and 
trade intermediaries on its Web site, including a listing of EMCs. Industry trade associations and
publications and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Assistance Centers also can help
entrepreneurs to locate EMCs and other trade intermediaries.
Export Trading Companies Another tactic for getting into international markets with a minimum 
of cost and effort is through export trading companies. Export trading companies (ETCs) are 
businesses that buy and sell products in a number of countries, and they typically offer a wide 
range of services, such as exporting, importing, shipping, storing, distributing, and others, to their 
clients. Unlike EMCs, which tend to focus on exporting, ETCs usually perform both import and 
export trades across many countries’ borders. Although EMCs usually create exclusive contracts 
with companies for a particular product line, ETCs often represent several companies selling the 
same product line. However, like EMCs, ETCs lower the risk of exporting for small businesses. 
Some of the largest ETCs in the world are based in the United States and Japan. In fact, many 
businesses that have navigated successfully Japan’s complex system of distribution have done so 
with the help of ETCs.
In 1982, Congress passed the Export Trading Company Act to allow producers of similar 
products to form ETC cooperatives without the fear of violating antitrust laws. The goal was to
encourage U.S. companies to export more goods by allowing businesses in the same industry to
band together to form ETCs.
Manufacturer’s Export Agents Manufacturer’s export agents (MEAs) act as international sales
representatives in a limited number of markets for various noncompeting domestic companies. 
Unlike the close, partnering relationship formed with most EMCs, the relationship between the MEA 
and a small company is a short-term one, and the MEA typically operates on a commission basis.
Export Merchants Export merchants are domestic wholesalers who do business in foreign
markets. They buy goods from many domestic manufacturers and then market them in foreign 
markets. Unlike MEAs, export merchants often carry competing lines, meaning that they have 
little loyalty to suppliers. Most export merchants specialize in particular industries, such as office
equipment, computers, and industrial supplies.
Resident Buying Offices Another approach to exporting is to sell to a resident buying office, 
a government- or privately owned operation of one country established in another country for 
the purpose of buying goods made there. Many foreign governments and businesses have set 
up buying offices in the United States. Selling to them is just like selling to domestic customers 
because the buying office handles all the details of exporting.
Foreign Distributors Some small businesses work through foreign distributors to reach inter-
national markets. Domestic small companies export their products to these distributors, who

handle all of the marketing, distribution, support, and service functions in the foreign country. 
The key to success is screening potential distributors to find those that are reliable, financially 
sound, and customer focused.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Dr. Roy Archambault: DryCorp DryCorp, located in
Wilmington, North Carolina, manufactures products that help waterproof other products.
DryCorp, which was founded by Dr. Roy Archambault, developed its first line of products to water-
proof casts, bandages, ostomies, and prosthetics using a rubber sleeve. The product allows patients
to swim, bathe, shower, and to receive hydrotherapy without any damage to the medical product 
protected by the sleeve. DryCorp then developed a line of crystal clear bags that vacuum-seal elec-
tronic devices while still allowing them to be fully functional. Products include cases for tablets, 
earphones, and backpacks. Because DryCorp’s products are highly seasonal, the company relies on
foreign distributors in markets such as Australia that have opposite seasons to the United States.15 ■
THE VALUE OF USING TRADE INTERMEDIARIES Trade intermediaries such as these are becoming 
increasingly popular among small businesses attempting to branch out into world markets because 
they make that transition much faster and easier. Most small business owners simply do not have
the knowledge, resources, or confidence to go global alone. Intermediaries’ global networks of 
buyers and sellers allow their small business customers to build their international sales much
faster and with fewer hassles and mistakes. Entrepreneurs who are inexperienced in global sales 
and attempt to crack certain foreign markets alone quickly discover just how difficult the challenge 
can be. However, with their know-how, experience, and contacts, trade intermediaries can get 
small companies’ products into foreign markets quickly and efficiently. The primary disadvantage
of using trade intermediaries is that doing so requires entrepreneurs to surrender control over their 
foreign sales. However, by maintaining close contact with intermediaries and evaluating their 
performance regularly, entrepreneurs can avoid major problems.
The key to establishing a successful relationship with a trade intermediary is conducting a 
thorough screening to determine which type of intermediary—and which one in particular—will 
best serve a small company’s needs. Entrepreneurs should look for intermediaries that special-
ize in the products their companies sell and that have experience and established contacts in the
countries they have targeted. An entrepreneur looking for an intermediary should compile a list 
of potential candidates using some of the sources listed in Table 15.1. After compiling the list, 
entrepreneurs should evaluate each one using a list of criteria to narrow the field to the most 
promising ones. Interviewing a principal from each intermediary on the final list should tell 
entrepreneurs which ones are best able to meet their companies’ needs. Finally, before signing 
any agreement with a trade intermediary, it is wise to conduct thorough background and credit 
checks. Entrepreneurs with experience in global trade also suggest entering short-term agree-
ments of about a year with new trade intermediaries to allow time to test their ability and willing-
ness to live up to their promises. Many entrepreneurs begin their global business initiatives with 
trade intermediaries and then venture into international business on their own as their skill and 
comfort levels increase.
JOINT VENTURES Joint ventures, both domestic and foreign, lower the risk of entering global 
markets for small businesses. They also give small companies more clout in foreign lands. In a 
domestic joint venture, two or more U.S. small businesses form an alliance for the purpose of 
exporting their goods and services. For export ventures, participating companies get antitrust 
immunity, allowing them to cooperate freely. The businesses share the responsibility and the 
costs of getting export licenses and permits, and they split the venture’s profits. Establishing a 
joint venture with the right partner has become an essential part of maintaining a competitive 
position in global markets for a growing number of industries.
In a foreign joint venture, a domestic small business forms an alliance with a company in the
target nation. The host partner brings to the joint venture valuable knowledge of the local market 
and its method of operation as well as of the customs and the tastes of local customers, making it 
much easier to conduct business in the foreign country. Sometimes foreign countries place certain 
limitations on joint ventures, for example, requiring host companies to hold a majority stake in 
the venture.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Sean “Diddy” Combs and Diageo Beverages: DeLeon 
Tequila Sean “Diddy” Combs, a successful entertainer and entrepreneur, formed a joint 
venture with the British beverage company, Diageo Beverages, to purchase the Mexican tequila
brand DeLeon. DeLeon tequila sells at prices that range from $120 to more than $1,000 a bottle.
Both parties contributed cash to the transaction and are equal owners in the joint venture. In ad-
dition to the cash he invested, Combs offers strong marketing skills and connections to the enter-
tainment industry. In addition to its cash contribution, Diageo brings its industry leadership in the 
adult beverage market.16 ■
The most important ingredient in the recipe for a successful joint venture is choosing the
right partner. Taking the following steps will help avoid problems:
● Select a partner that shares the company’s values and standards of conduct.
● Define at the outset important issues such as each party’s contributions and responsibilities, 
the distribution of earnings, the expected life of the relationship, and the circumstances un-
der which the parties can terminate the relationship.
● Understand their partner’s reasons and objectives for joining the venture.
● Spell out in writing exactly how the venture will work and where decision-making authority lies.
● Select a partner whose skills are different from but compatible with those of the company’s.
● Prepare a “prenuptial agreement” that spells out what will happen in case of a “business
divorce.”
FOREIGN LICENSING Rather than sell their products or services directly to customers overseas,
some small companies enter foreign markets by licensing businesses in other nations to use their 
patents, trademarks, copyrights, technology, processes, or products. In return for licensing these 
assets, a small company collects royalties from the sales of its foreign licenses. Licensing is a 
relatively simple way for even the most inexperienced business owner to extend his or her reach 
into global markets. Licensing is ideal for companies whose value lies in its intellectual property, 
unique products or services, recognized name, or proprietary technology. Although many 
businesses consider licensing only their products to foreign companies, the licensing potential 
for intangibles, such as processes, technology, copyrights, and trademarks, often is greater. Some
entrepreneurs earn more money from licensing their know-how for product design, manufacturing,
or quality control than they do from actually selling their finished goods in a highly competitive 
foreign market with which they are not familiar. Foreign licensing enables a small business to 
enter foreign markets quickly and easily and with virtually no capital investment. Risks to the
company include the potential loss of control over its manufacturing and marketing processes 
and creating a competitor if the licensee gains too much knowledge and control. Securing proper 
patent, trademark, and copyright protection beforehand can minimize those risks.
INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISING Franchising has become a major export industry for the United
States. Over the last several decades, a growing number of franchises have been attracted to
international markets to boost sales and profits as the domestic market has become increasingly 
saturated with outlets and much tougher to wring growth from. Franchisors should consider 
expanding into global markets when foreign markets present an important growth opportunity
for the franchise. Yum! Brands, the franchisor of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell restaurants, has 
a significant global presence with more than 40,000 restaurants in 117 countries. International
franchising, particularly in fast-growing markets such as India and China, has been essential to 
the company’s growth; in fact, China alone accounts for 40 percent of Yum! Brands’ profits.17 To 
be successful in global markets, a franchisor should have the following characteristics:
● Sufficient managerial and financial resources to devote to globalization
● A solid track record of success in the United States
● Adequate trademark protection for the franchise’s brand
● Time-tested training, support, and reporting procedures that help franchisees succeed18

Franchisors that decide to expand internationally should take these steps:
1. Identify the country or countries that are best suited to the franchisor’s business concept. 
Factors to consider include a country’s business climate, demographic profile, level of eco-
nomic development, rate of economic growth, degree of legal protection, language and cul-
tural barriers, and market potential. Franchisors making their first forays into global markets 
should consider focusing on a single nation or a small group of similar nations.
2. Generate leads for potential franchisees. Franchisors looking for prospective franchisees 
in foreign markets have many tools available to them, including international franchise 
trade shows, their own Web sites, trade missions, and brokers. Many franchisors have had
success with trade missions, such as those sponsored by trade groups like the International 
Franchise Association or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Gold Key Program. These 
trade missions are designed to introduce franchisors to qualified franchise candidates in 
target countries. Others rely on brokers who have extensive business contacts in specific
countries.
3. Select quality candidates. Just as in any franchise relationship, the real key to success is
choosing the right franchisee. Because of the complexity and cost of international franchis-
ing, selecting quality franchisees is essential to success. Establishing an intranet allows 
franchisors to stay in contact with their international franchisees across time zones.
4. Structure the franchise deal. Franchisors can structure international franchise arrange-
ments in a variety of ways, but three techniques are most popular: direct franchising, area 
development, and master franchising.
● Direct franchising, common in domestic franchise deals, involves selling single-unit 
franchises to individual operators in foreign countries. Although dealing with individual 
franchisees makes it easier for the franchisor to maintain control, it also requires more 
of the franchisor’s time and resources.
● Area development is similar to direct franchising except that the franchisor allows 
the franchisee to develop multiple units in a particular territory, perhaps a province, a 
county, or even an entire nation. A successful area development strategy depends on a 
franchisor selecting and then supporting quality franchisees. In 2001, brothers Manpreet 
and Gurpreet Gulri entered into an area development agreement with Subway to expand
the sandwich chain’s presence in India; they now operate more than 200 stores there. 
“We work closely with local chefs and regional suppliers to ensure a good balance of 
vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, along with many traditional Subway menu items, 
all specifically selected to appeal to the Indian palate,” says Manpreet.19
● Master franchising is the most popular strategy for companies entering international 
markets. In a master franchising arrangement, a franchisor grants an experienced mas-
ter franchisee the right to sell outlets to subfranchisees in a broad geographic area or 
sometimes in an entire country. Franchisors use this method to expand into international 
markets quickly and efficiently because their master franchisees understand local laws 
and customs and the nuances of selling in local markets. Although master franchising 
simplifies a franchisor’s expansion into global markets, it generates less revenue for 
franchisers than direct franchising and gives them the least amount of control over their 
international franchisees. Domino’s Pizza, with more than 5,000 outlets in 70 countries 
outside the United States, relies on master franchises, especially in emerging markets 
such as India, China, Malaysia, and Turkey. Jubilant FoodWorks Limited, Domino’s 
Pizza’s master franchisee in India, operates nearly 450 outlets, but Richard Alison, 
Domino’s Pizza’s international president, says the country has the potential to have 
at least 1,000 locations.20
Just as they do in the United States, franchisors in international markets sell virtually every 
kind of product or service imaginable—from fast food to child day care. In some cases, the prod-
ucts and services sold in international markets are identical to those sold in the United States. 
However, most franchisors have learned that adaptation is the key to making sure their goods and 
services suit local tastes and customs. Traveling the world, one discovers that American fast-food

giants such as Domino’s, KFC, and McDonald’s make significant modifications in their menu to 
remain attractive to the demands of local customers.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tony Chew: KFC Vietnam One of the more active re-
gions for international franchising is Southeast Asia. Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar, Brunei, Cambodia, and Laos are experiencing rapid 
growth in American franchised restaurants. One of the most popular franchises is KFC, which first
came to Vietnam in 1997 through the vision of Singapore entrepreneur and franchisee Tony 
Chew. When Chew opened the first KFC in Vietnam, there was a limited power supply, poor 
roads, an untrained workforce, and a weak business climate. KFC Vietnam (KFCV) currently oper-
ates 140 restaurants and employs 4,000 workers.21 ■
COUNTERTRADING AND BARTERING A countertrade is a transaction in which a company selling
goods in a foreign country agrees to promote investment and trade in that country. The goal of the
transaction is to help offset the capital drain from the foreign country’s purchases. As entrepreneurs
enter more and more developing countries, they will need to develop skills at implementing this
strategy. In some cases, small and medium-size businesses find it advantageous to work together 
with large corporations that have experience in the implementation of this marketing strategy.
Countertrading suffers numerous drawbacks. Countertrade transactions can be complicated, 
cumbersome, and time consuming. They also increase the chances that a company will get stuck 
with merchandise that it cannot move. They can lead to unpleasant surprises concerning the 
quantity and quality of products required in the countertrade. Still, countertrading offers one 
major advantage: sometimes it’s the only way to make a sale!
Entrepreneurs must weigh the advantages against the disadvantages for their company before 
committing to a countertrade deal. Because of its complexity and the risks involved, countertrad-
ing is not the best choice for a novice entrepreneur looking to break into the global marketplace.
Bartering, the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services, is another way of 
trading with countries lacking convertible currency. In a barter exchange, a company that manufac-
tures electronics components might trade its products for the coffee a business in a foreign country
processes, which it then sells to a third company for cash. Barter transactions require finding a 
business with complementary needs, but they are much simpler than countertrade transactions.
EXPORTING For many years, small businesses in the United States focused solely on the domestic
market, never venturing beyond its borders. However, growing numbers of small companies,
realizing the growth and profit potential that exporting offers, are making globalization part of 
their marketing plans. Although small and medium-size companies account for nearly 98 percent 
of the 302,000 U.S. businesses that export goods and services, they generate just one-third of the 
nation’s export sales. Their impact is significant, however; small companies generate $2.1 billion 
in day in export sales. Owners of small companies that export say that two of the main benefits 
their companies reap are increased sales and profits and larger, more diversified customer bases.22
Many more small companies have the potential to export but are not doing so. The biggest 
barrier facing companies that have never exported is not knowing where or how to start, but 
entrepreneurs have a treasure trove of resources, training, and consulting on which they can draw. 
The International Trade Administration’s Export Programs Guide provides entrepreneurs with 
a comprehensive list of 100 federal programs in 20 agencies designed to help U.S. exporters. 
The U.S. Commercial Service Web site is an excellent starting point for entrepreneurs who are 
looking for international business partners to help their companies expand into global markets. 
Many entrepreneurs also find the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Export Business Planner,
a comprehensive set of worksheets that guides users through the process of building an export 
business plan, to be a valuable resource.
Another source of useful information are the U.S. Export Assistance Centers that serve as
single contact points for information on the multitude of federal export programs that are de-
signed to help entrepreneurs who want to start exporting. The U.S. government’s export Internet 
portal gives entrepreneurs access to valuable information about exporting in general (finance, 
shipping, documentation, and others) as well as details on individual nations (market research, 
trade agreements, statistics, and more). Learning more about exporting and realizing that it is 
within the realm of possibility for small companies—even very small companies—is the first and

often most difficult step in breaking the psychological barrier to exporting. The next challenge is 
to create a sound export strategy:
Step 1. Recognize that even the tiniest companies and least experienced entrepreneurs 
have the potential to export. Many entrepreneurs never considering exporting 
because they think their companies are too small; however, a business’s size has
nothing to do with the global potential of its products. In fact, 33 percent of the 
The Pasta Shoppe, located in Nashville, Tennessee, manufactures
and distributes pasta. John Aron and his wife Carey, cofounders 
of The Pasta Shoppe, first came up with the idea for a pasta busi-
ness while on their honeymoon in Italy. They were inspired by the
many shapes of pasta they discovered as they traveled through-
out the many regions of Italy. What differentiates The Pasta Com-
pany from its competitors is that it makes pasta in a variety of fun
shapes that are tied to people’s favorite college sports teams and 
to various holidays, such as Christmas, St Patrick’s Day, Halloween, 
and Thanksgiving. The Arons found a way to Americanize the va-
riety of pasta shapes that had caught their imaginations while on 
their honeymoon.
Rather than compete with other mass production pasta busi-
nesses, the Arons chose to build the company by focusing on small 
batch production using high-quality ingredients and a carefully de-
signed manufacturing process. The company buys all of its wheat 
from the Dakotas and uses specially designed bronze tools to cut the
pasta into the various shapes. The Pasta Shoppe dries the pasta over-r
night in carts, rather than using the speed drying machines favored by 
large manufacturers. Its products are sold online, through specialty re-
tailers, and as a fundraising product for schools and youth programs. 
The Pasta Shoppe is able to more favorably price its products by avoid-
ing selling through mass retailers, which typically demand discounts.
The company has experienced strong growth in the U.S. market since
it was founded in 1994, even during economic downturns.
Then in 1998, The Pasta Shoppe entered its first interna-
tional market, Japan, which remains its largest market outside
the United States. Its success in Japan is due to Japanese interest 
in Western celebrations and holidays. John Aron recognized that
international markets would extend the company’s season for its 
holiday products due to the earlier production needed to move 
its product to Japanese distributors. The company quickly learned 
that to be successful, it had to customize its products and packag-
ing to fit the Japanese consumer market.
The Pasta Shoppe’s first entry into Japan had to be cut short
in 2000 due to the outbreak of Asian flu. Because the two years 
it sold in Japan were highly successful, the company reentered 
the Japanese market in 2003 after the Asian flu scare had passed.
Based on its success in Japan, The Pasta Shoppe now exports
to Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, and 
Guam. The company is currently attempting to develop distribution 
into the Philippines and South Korea. However, although the Arons 
have tried, they have made no headway into exporting to China.
When considering a move into a new international market,
the Arons use specific criteria to assess its attractiveness. In addi-
tion to the quality of the foreign distributor and projected cash
flow, timing is everything. The company looks for international
sales that do not conflict with sales in the domestic market, which 
peak from September through December, because the U.S. 
market remains its most profitable market.
Pricing is key to success in international markets for The Pasta 
Shoppe. “It’s our toughest priced sales channel,” says Aron.

by operating as a global business.
2. Identify some of the barriers that companies such as The 
Pasta Shoppe encounter as they expand internationally. 
What steps can entrepreneurs take to overcome these 
obstacles?

companies global?

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
TABLE 15.2 Assessing Your Company’s Export Potential
1. Does your company have a product or service that has been successfully sold in the domestic market? A product’s or 
service’s success in the domestic market is a good indicator of its potential success in markets abroad. However, because selling 
domestically and internationally are entirely different ventures, entrepreneurs should read A Basic Guide to Exporting (http://
www.export.gov/basicguide/) to learn what to expect when selling internationally.
2. Does your company have or is your company preparing an international marketing plan with defined goals and strategies? 
Many companies begin export activities haphazardly, without carefully screening markets or options for market entry. A 
marketing plan allows your company to find and focus on the best export opportunities. Formulating an export strategy based 
on good information and proper assessment increases the chances that you will choose the best options, that you will use your 
company’s resources effectively, and, therefore, that your efforts will successful. To find market research on the countries you are 
interested in selling to, visit the Market Research Library (http://export.gov/mrktresearch/index.asp).
3. Does your company have sufficient production capacity that can be committed to the export market? To export successfully, 
your company must meet the demand that it creates in foreign markets. You may need more space and equipment to manufacture 
for the specific countries you are selling to (who have their own product standards and regulations). Expanding into the 
international marketplace will result in a higher number of units to manufacture, and you do not want this increase in production 
to lower your company’s quality of output.
4. Does your company have the financial resources to actively support the marketing of your products in the targeted overseas 
markets? Developing foreign markets requires financial resources. This is a big hurdle for many small companies because it 
involves activities such as international travel, participation in trade shows, market research, and international business training. 
However, there are many government programs to help finance companies’ export sales, including the Export-Import Bank 
(Ex-Im Bank) (www.exim.gov), the U.S. Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov/content/export-loan-programs), the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (www.fas.usda.gov), and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (www.opic.gov).
5. Is your company’s management committed to developing export markets and willing and able to dedicate staff, time, and 
resources to the process? Management commitment is the number one determining factor for export success. Developing 
an export market takes time and effort, and managers must be certain they can afford to allocate sufficient time to exporting. 
Whether managers are willing to invest the time to build an export business plan is a good indicator of their commitment to an 
export initiative.
6. Is your company committed to providing the same level of service to foreign customers that it gives to domestic customers? 
This is a commitment every business must make before it begins selling in foreign markets. Successful exporters treat their 
foreign customers with the same commitment and service as their domestic customers. They are responsive to inquiries from 
international customers, work hard to build positive relationships with them, and establish systems to provide the same top-notch
service they provide to their domestic customers.
7. Does your company have adequate knowledge in modifying product packaging and ingredients to meet foreign import 
regulations and cultural preferences? Selecting and preparing your product for export requires not only product knowledge 
but also knowledge of the unique characteristics of each market your company is targeting. Sound market research and input 
from foreign representatives tell a company about the potential to sell its products or services in specific target countries. Before 
the sale can occur, however, a company may have to modify its products and services to satisfy customers’ tastes, needs, or 
preferences and legal requirements in foreign markets. Entrepreneurs can learn about regulations and export controls at http://
export.gov/regulation/index.asp.
8. Does your company have adequate knowledge in shipping its product overseas, such as identifying and selecting 
international freight forwarders and freight costing? When shipping a product overseas, entrepreneurs must be aware of 
packaging, labeling, documentation, and insurance requirements. Violating these requirements often means severe and expensive
penalties. This is where international freight forwarders can help. These agents understand the export regulations of the U.S. 
government, the import rules and regulations of foreign countries, appropriate methods of shipping, and the documents related 
to foreign trade. Freight forwarders assist exporters in preparing price quotations by advising on freight costs, port charges, 
consular fees, costs of special documentation, insurance costs, and handling fees. To find a freight forwarder, entrepreneurs can 
visit the National Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association of America at www.ncbfaa.org.
9. Does your company have adequate knowledge of export payment mechanisms, such as developing and negotiating letters 
of credit? Experienced exporters have extensive knowledge of export payment mechanisms and extend credit cautiously. They 
evaluate new customers with care and continuously monitor existing customers’ accounts. For general information on ways to
receive payments, methods of payment, and currency issues and payment problems, see A Basic Guide to Exporting (http://
export.gov/basicguide/) and other resources described in this chapter. Conducting a credit check of potential buyers is essential 
because collecting delinquent accounts receivable from foreign customers is more difficult than collecting them from domestic 
customers. Exporters can use the U.S. Commercial Service’s International Company Profiles (ICPs) to gain insight into the 
creditworthiness of potential customers. ICPs contain financial profiles of foreign companies and information on their size, 
capitalization, and number of years in business.

small companies that are exporters have no employees.23 If a company’s products 
meet the needs of global customers, it has the potential to export. Studies suggest 
that small companies that export are stronger and grow markedly faster than those 
that do not. Table 15.2 provides nine questions designed to help entrepreneurs 
assess the export potential of their companies.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: William Haynes: Sabai Technology After William
Haynes was laid off during the financial crisis, he started Sabai Technology, a company 
based in Simpsonville, South Carolina, that develops and sells wireless routers and network 
equipment, with himself as the sole employee. Initially, Haynes sold only to domestic customers
until one of his customers, Strong VPN, opened the door to orders from companies in China. 
International sales took off after people involved in an Egyptian uprising discovered that Sabai 
Technology’s wireless routers could send and receive information that was blocked by govern-
ment filters. Haynes began working with the U.S. Commercial Service and U.S. Export Assis-
tance Centers, which led him to advertise his products in Commercial News USA, a publication 
that goes to more than 400,000 readers in 178 countries. Today, international sales account for
80 percent of Sabai Technology’s sales, and the company, which exports to 120 countries, has 
grown to 14 employees. Haynes uses superior customer service and speedy delivery to set his
company apart from the competition, most of which are much larger businesses.24 ■
Step 2. Analyze your product or service. Is it special? New? Unique? High quality?
Priced favorably because of lower costs or favorable exchange rates? Does it 
fit well with the culture and traditions of a country or region? Process Barron, 
owned by Cliff Moss and Ken Nolen, manufactures large fans used to clean air 
in factories. The company, located in Pelham, Alabama, struggled when first at-
tempting to sell its products internationally. Moss and Nolen realized they lacked
the knowledge needed to be successful exporters. After sending members of the 
management team to export seminars at a local university, the company began to 
have success negotiating financing and payment terms with international custom-
ers. Its international accounts helped the company to grow even in the midst of 
the Great Recession, which was not the case for many companies operating in the
industrial sector.25
In many foreign countries, products from the United States are in demand 
because they have an air of mystery about them! In some cases, entrepreneurs find 
that they must make slight modifications to their products to accommodate local 
tastes, customs, and preferences. For instance, when Joseph Zaritski, owner of an 
Australian juice company, began marketing his company’s products in Russia,
he met with limited success until he realized that package size was the problem. 
Willing customers simply could not afford to purchase the two-liter bottles in 
which the juice was packaged. Zaritski switched to one-liter bottles and saw sales 
climb by 80 percent within six months!26
Step 3. Analyze your commitment. Are you willing to devote time and energy to 
develop export markets? Does your company have the necessary resources?
Patience is essential. An exporting initiative can take from six to eight months
(or longer) to get off the ground, but entering foreign markets isn’t as tough as 
most entrepreneurs think.
Step 4. Research markets and pick your target. Fifty-five percent of small businesses
that export sell to just four or fewer countries (see Figure 15.3). Before investing
in a costly sales trip abroad, however, entrepreneurs should search the Internet or 
make a trip to the local library or the nearest branch of the Department of Com-
merce. Exporters can choose from a multitude of guides, manuals, books, newslet-
ters, videos, and other resources to help them research potential markets. Market 
research must include more than just the size of the potential market; it should 
include a detailed analysis of the demographic and buying habits of the customers 
in it as well as the cultural nuances of selling there.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Wood Stone Ovens Wood Stone Ovens, based in
Bellingham, Washington, sells its restaurant cooking equipment to customers in more 
than 75 countries. The company realized an unexpected benefit from its international sales ac-
tivities: As its sales team traveled to meet with customers around the globe, they came back 
with many new product ideas. Exports account for 25 percent of Wood Stone Ovens’s annual 
revenues.27 ■
Armed with research, entrepreneurs can avoid wasting time and money 
on markets with limited potential for their products and can concentrate on 
those with the greatest promise. The nations that account for the greatest export 
volume for U.S. businesses are Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, and Germany.28
Some of the most helpful tools for researching foreign markets are the Country 
and Industry Market Reports available at the U.S. government’s export Web 
portal; these reports provide detailed information on the economic, political, 
regulatory, and investment environment for countries ranging from Afghanistan 
to Zimbabwe. Research tells entrepreneurs whether they need to modify their 
existing products and services to suit the tastes and preferences of their foreign
target customers. Sometimes, foreign customers’ lifestyles, housing needs, body
size, and cultures require exporters to make alterations in their product lines. 
Making just slight modifications to adapt products and services to local tastes 
can sometimes spell the difference between success and failure in the global
market. Entrepreneurs also should consider traveling to trade shows in the coun-
tries they are targeting to witness firsthand customers’ responses to their prod-
ucts and services.
Step 5. Develop a distribution strategy. Should you use a trade intermediary or sell 
directly to foreign customers? As you learned earlier in this chapter, many small 
companies just entering international markets prefer to rely on trade intermediar-
ies to break new ground. Using intermediaries often makes sense until an entre-
preneur has the chance to gain experience in exporting and to learn the ground 
rules of selling in foreign lands.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: John Burke: Louisiana Caviar Company The Loui-
siana Caviar Company, founded by John Burke, sells its product to customers in an un-
likely foreign market: Russia. Louisiana Caviar Company harvests its caviar from bowfin fish in
Louisiana’s Atchafalaya Swamp, which is the largest wetland in the United States. The com-
pany sells caviar with a Cajun twist, flavoring the delicacy with various Cajun spices. The 
Russian market opened up due to efforts to ban caviar from the Caspian Sea in Russia. Over-
fishing and pollution have endangered sturgeon, which are the traditional source of Russian 
caviar. Louisiana Caviar Company exports 80 percent of its product, with half of its exports 
going to Russia.29 ■
Step 6. Find your customer. According to a study by the U.S. International Trade 
Commission, one of the most common problems among small business exporters 
is finding prospective customers.30 After all, establishing a network of business 
contacts takes time and resources. Small businesses can rely on a host of export 
specialists to help them track down foreign customers. The U.S. Department of 

CHAPTER 15 • GLOBAL ASPECTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP

Commerce and the International Trade Administration should be the first stops 
on any entrepreneur’s agenda for going global. These agencies have the market re-
search available for locating the best target markets for a particular company and 
specific customers in those markets. Industry Sector Analyses, International Mar-
ket Insights, and Customized Market Analyses are just some of the reports and
services global entrepreneurs find most useful. These agencies also have knowl-
edgeable staff specialists experienced in the details of global trade and in the 
intricacies of foreign cultures. GlobalEDGE (http://globaledge.msu.edu), an inter-
national trade information portal, also offers useful information on doing business 
in more than 200 countries, including directories, tutorials, online courses, and 
diagnostic tools designed to help companies determine their potential for conduct-
ing global business. The International Finance Corporation’s Enterprise Surveys
give entrepreneurs useful profiles of the business environments in 135 countries, 
ranging from overviews of basic infrastructure and business regulations to corrup-
tion and business obstacles. Through its Gold and Platinum Key services, the U.S.
Commercial Service provides entrepreneurs who want to take their companies 
global with a list of prescreened distributors and potential customers and arranges 
face-to-face meetings with them.
One of the most efficient and least expensive ways for entrepreneurs to locate 
potential customers for their companies’ products and services is to participate in 
a trade mission. These missions usually are sponsored by either a federal or a state 
economic development agency or an industry trade association for the purpose of 
cultivating international trade by connecting domestic companies with potential 
trading partners overseas. A trade mission may focus on a particular industry or 
may cover several industries but target a particular country. Pactrans Air & Sea, 
Inc., a small business headquartered in Bensenville, Illinois, participated in a trade 
mission to China organized by the SBDC office at Governors State University. 
During the trade mission, Pactrans managers had 95 business appointments, gen-
erated 450 sales leads, negotiated two joint ventures, and closed contacts worth 
more than $1 million during the trade mission. Pactrans owner Alex Pon antici-
pates adding 5 or 6 employees to his existing staff of 45 to accommodate the in-
creased business activity that resulted from the trade mission.31
Step 7. Find financing. One of the biggest barriers to small business exports is lack of fi-
nancing. Access to adequate financing is a crucial ingredient in a successful export 
program because the cost of generating foreign sales often is higher and collection 
cycles are longer than in domestic markets. The trouble is that bankers and other 
providers of capital don’t always understand the intricacies of international sales 
and view financing them as excessively risky. In addition, among major industrial-
ized nations, the U.S. government spends the least per capita to promote exports.
Several federal, state, and private programs are operating to fill this export fi-
nancing void, however. Loan programs from the Small Business Administration’s 
include its Export Working Capital program (90 percent loan guarantees up to 
$5 million), International Trade Loan program (90 percent loan guarantees up
to $5 million) and Export Express program (75 to 90 percent loan guarantees 
up to $500,000). In addition, the Ex-Im Bank, the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation, and a variety of state-sponsored programs offer export-minded entre-
preneurs both direct loans and loan guarantees. The Ex-Im Bank, which has been 
financing the sale of U.S. exports since 1934, provides small exporters with export 
credit insurance and loans through its working capital line of credit and a variety 
of preexport loan programs. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation pro-
vides loans and loan guarantees up to $250 million to support foreign investments
by small and medium-size companies and offers businesses discounted political 
risk insurance. The Bankers Association for Foreign Trade is an association of 
banks around the world that matches exporters in need of foreign trade financing 
with interested banks.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Lisa Howlett: Auburn Leather Company Auburn 
Leather Company, located in Auburn, Kentucky, manufactures leather laces for foot-
wear and sporting equipment. Auburn Leather expanded its international sales with the help 
of a small business insurance policy from the Ex-Im Bank, which assigns and insures Auburn 
Leather’s export accounts receivable. This insurance gives lenders the confidence to provide 
working capital financing for Auburn Leather’s export sales. Growth in international sales has 
created more than 30 new jobs at Auburn Leather and has increased its annual revenues from 
$7.4 million to more than $11 million. Export sales have grown from 33 percent of total sales to
45 percent. Auburn Leather’s President, Lisa Howlett, says the growth from international sales 
has created 20 new jobs at her company.32 ■
Step 8. Ship your goods. Export novices usually rely on international freight forwarders 
and customs brokers—experienced specialists in overseas shipping—for help in 
navigating the bureaucratic morass of packaging and regulatory requirements, tar-
iffs, and paperwork demanded by customs. These specialists, also known as trans-
port architects, are to exporters what travel agents are to travelers and normally 
charge relatively small fees for a valuable service. They not only move shipments 
of all sizes to destinations all over the world efficiently, saving entrepreneurs 
many headaches, but also are well versed in the regulations that govern exported 
products and services. For example, packaging for Ganong Brothers, Canada’s 
oldest candy maker, must read “5 mg” (with a space between the number and 
unit of measurement) for products sold in Canada. To sell the same product in the
United States, just across the border from its factory, the company’s packaging 
must read “5mg” (with no space between the number and unit of measurement).33
Exporters can find local freight forwarders and customs brokers at the National 
Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association of America’s Web site.
Shipping terms, always important for determining which party in a trans-
action pays the cost of shipping and bears the risk of loss or damage to the 
goods while they are in transit, take on heightened importance in international 
transactions.
Step 9. Collect your money. A survey by the National Small Business Association and 
the Small Business Exporters Association reports that the top concern of com-
panies that export is collecting payment for the goods and services they sell.34
Collecting foreign accounts can be more complex than collecting domestic ones; 
however, by picking their customers carefully and checking their credit references
closely, entrepreneurs can minimize bad-debt losses. Businesses that engage in 
international sales use four primary payment methods (ranked from least risky to 
most risky): cash in advance, a letter of credit, a bank (or documentary) draft, and 
an open account. The safest method of selling to foreign customers is to collect 
cash in advance of the sale because it eliminates the risk of collection problems 
and provides immediate cash flow. However, requiring cash payments up front 
severely limits a small company’s base of foreign customers.
A letter of credit is an agreement between an exporter’s bank and the for-
eign buyer’s bank that guarantees payment to the exporter for a specific ship-
ment of goods. In essence, a letter of credit reduces the financial risk for the
exporter by substituting a bank’s creditworthiness for that of the purchaser (see
Figure 15.4). A bank draft is a document the seller draws on the buyer, requir-
ing the buyer to pay the face amount (the purchase price of the goods) either 
on sight (a sight draft) or on a specified date (a time draft) once the goods have
been shipped. With either letters of credit or bank drafts, small exporters must 
be sure that all of the required documentation is present and accurate; otherwise,
they may experience delays in the payments due to them from the buyer or the 
participating banks. Rather than use letters of credit or drafts, some exporters
simply sell to foreign customers on open account. In other words, they ship the 
goods to a foreign customer without any guarantee of payment. This method is 
riskiest because collecting a delinquent account from a foreign customer is even 
more difficult than collecting past-due payments from a domestic customer.

One way that small exporters can minimize the risk of bad-debt losses on for-
eign credit sales is to purchase export credit insurance, which protects a com-
pany against the nonpayment of its foreign customers’ open accounts. The cost 
of export credit insurance typically is a small percentage of the amount of the
foreign sale a company is insuring. Private insurers and the Ex-Im Bank offer 
export credit insurance.
ESTABLISHING INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS Once established in international markets, some 
small businesses set up permanent locations there. Establishing an office or a factory in a foreign 
land can require a substantial investment reaching beyond the budgets of many small companies.
In addition, setting up an international office can be an incredibly frustrating experience in 
some countries where business infrastructure is in disrepair or is nonexistent. Hayden Hamilton, 
founder of GreenPrint Technologies, a company that sells software that reduces printing costs
by eliminating unnecessary pages, opened an office in India, where he can get bargain rates 
on quality software programming. He was frustrated when it took three hours to apply for a 
telephone line—and one month to get it installed. Because power outages in India are common,
GreenPrint also had to purchase expensive backup generators.35
In some countries, securing necessary licenses and permits from bureaucrats often takes 
more than filing the necessary paperwork; in some nations, bureaucrats expect payments to 
“grease the wheels” of commerce. American entrepreneurs consider payments to reduce the 
amount of red tape involved in an international transaction to be bribery, and many simply avoid 
doing business in countries where “grease payments” are standard procedure. In fact, the Foreign 
Corrupt Practice Act, passed in 1977, considers bribing foreign officials to be a criminal act. One 
study by the World Bank of grease payments for the purpose of minimizing the red tape imposed 
by foreign regulations concludes that the payments do not work; in fact, companies that actually 
used them experienced greater government scrutiny and red tape in their international transac-
tions.36 Finally, finding the right person to manage an international office is crucial to success; 
it also is a major challenge, especially for small businesses. Small companies usually have lean
management staffs and cannot afford to send key people abroad without running the risk of los-
ing their focus.
Small companies that establish international locations can reap significant benefits. Start-up 
costs are lower in some foreign countries (but not all!), and lower labor costs can produce signifi-
cant savings. In addition, by locating in a country, a business gains a firsthand understanding of 
local customers’ preferences, tastes, and habits and the nuances of how culture influences busi-
ness practices. In essence, the business becomes a local corporate citizen.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Peter Marcum: DevDigi-
tal DevDigital has offices in Nashville, Tennessee, and
Baroda, India. DevDigital began as company that bought used 
Internet network assets, such as routers and switches, from dis-
tressed companies at a steep discount. The company would refur-
bish the hardware and resell it to small independent network 
companies. Eventually the company expanded into operating 
digital networks. As profit margins for network operators became 
razor thin, the company made another major strategic shift. 
DevDigital purchased a small Web site programming shop in India 
being sold by one of their customers. “My theory was that the 
larger companies—Google, IBM, and Apple—were and had been 
diversifying globally in their software production,” says Peter 
Marcum, cofounder of DevDigital. “The problem for a smaller
U.S.-based operation, is who do you call, or trust, or where do you 
go to get started, in an overseas location?” DevDigital made the 
move into Web site development for smaller companies. It took 
about four years to fully integrate the two locations. Due to its 
cost advantage and stable employment, the company has been able to grow in the highly com-
petitive market of Web site development. DevDigital does about 80 percent work for hire, and the 
remainder are projects in which they take equity in exchange for Web site development. 
“My strongest advice to anyone wanting to set up off shore is find a local way in,” says Marcum.
“By that I mean you need a core group that will stay long-term as you build a team, just as you
would here in the U.S.”37 ■
IMPORTING AND OUTSOURCING In addition to selling their goods in foreign markets, small 
companies also buy goods from distributors and manufacturers in foreign markets. In the United 
States alone, companies import more than $2.7 trillion worth of goods and services annually.38
The intensity of price competition in many industries—from textiles and handbags to industrial 
machinery and computers—means that more companies now shop the world market looking 
for the best deals they can find. Because labor costs in countries such as Mexico, Taiwan, and
India are far below those in other nations, businesses there offer goods and services at very low 
prices. Increasingly, these nations are home to well-educated, skilled workers who are paid far 
less than comparable workers in the United States or Western Europe. For instance, a computer 
programmer in the United States might earn $100,000 a year, but in India, a computer programmer 
doing the same work earns $20,000 a year or less. As a result, many companies either import 
goods or outsource work directly to manufacturers in countries where costs are far lower than
they would be domestically.
Alibaba.com, an online trading platform started in Hangzhou, China, in 
1999, has enabled millions of small companies to find reliable suppliers and 
vendors around the globe for the products and services they sell. Alibaba.com 
boasts nearly 37 million registered users in more than 240 countries.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Nuvar Nuvar Inc., located in Holland, 
Michigan, develops and designs office furniture and healthcare prod-
ucts. Nuvar’s in-house engineering assists its customers with product develop-
ment and design. Through a global network of manufacturing suppliers,
Nuvar sources component parts manufacturing from Europe (France, Germany, 
and Italy), Asia (China, Taiwan, and Malaysia), and North America (Mexico and 
Canada). Parts are then shipped to its facilities in Michigan, where they are
assembled, packaged, and shipped to the final customer. Although Nuvar 
does not ship to international customers, its customers ship around the globe. 
“We still deal with the repercussions of dealing internationally,” says Scott
Kuyper, International Supply Chain Lead at Nuvar. “Different markets may 
have different requirements for testing, standards, etc. Because we’re in-
volved with product development, we really see this first hand.” With the 
breadth of international relationships, Nuvar has learned the importance of
being open minded and flexible when it comes to differences in culture strat-
egy and economies of their various global partners.39  ■

CHAPTER 15 • GLOBAL ASPECTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
609
Entrepreneurs who are considering importing goods and service or outsourcing their manu-
facturing to foreign countries should follow these steps:
● Make sure that importing or outsourcing is right for your business. Even though foreign
manufacturers often can provide items at significant cost savings, using them may not al-
ways be the best business decision. Some foreign manufacturers require sizable minimum 
orders, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth, before they will produce a 
product. Entrepreneurs sometimes discover that achieving the lowest price may require 
a trade-off of other important factors, such as quality and speed of delivery.
● Establish a target cost for your product. Before setting off on a global shopping spree, en-
trepreneurs first should determine exactly what they can afford to spend on manufacturing 
a product and make a profit on it. Given the low labor costs of many foreign manufacturers,
products that are the most labor intensive make good candidates.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tom Haarlander: ARCiPLEX ARCiPLEX, headquar-
tered in Nashville, Tennessee, is a medical manufacturing company. ARCiPLEX works
with entrepreneurs and established companies to invent, design, develop, and produce 
health and wellness products. Tom Haarlander, President and cofounder, made the strategic
decision to move its manufacturing from China to Mexico in early 2014. The company had
been using a Chinese manufacturer for a little over a year but found a lack of consistency in
the products from China, which resulted in warranty issues after the products were delivered 
to customers. Haarlander sent team members to live in China to monitor quality control, but 
the problems persisted. In an effort to improve its product quality and its team’s quality of 
life, Haarlander decided to move manufacturing back to North America. Haarlander was able 
to find manufacturers in the United States and sourced some work to a company in Mexico. 
“This has allowed us to cut travel and various other overhead costs,” says Haarlander. “Our 
cost per unit has risen, but our testing, quality control, headaches, and rework of product has 
dropped dramatically, cutting the overall cost. In the long run, we know we have made the 
best strategic decision for building a strong foundation for our company and we are proud 
to be supporting work in North America.”40 ■
● Do your research before you leave home. Investing time in basic research about the 
industry and potential suppliers in foreign lands is essential before setting foot on foreign 
soil. Useful resources are plentiful, and entrepreneurs should use them, including the 
Internet, the Federation of International Trade Associations, industry trade associations, 
government agencies (e.g., the U.S. Commercial Service’s Gold Key Matching Service), 
and consultants.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Jim Greene: Richland, LLC Richland, LLC, located in
Pulaski, Tennessee, is an industrial service company that supplies, assembles, fabricates, 
installs, paints, sandblasts, and tests equipment that contains mechanical or electrical compo-
nents. Richland has contracts with TSKE Tsukishima Kankyo Engineering Ltd., a Japanese com-
pany, and Moritani, a German company. Tsukishima Kankyo and Moritani engage in many 
joint projects around the globe. Richland recently partnered with the two companies in a 
wastewater project for a client in Dubai that was developing a recreation area and golf course 
for a multinational community in Dubai. Richland provided manufacturing and test assembly 
for the water and wastewater treatment equipment that was shipped to Dubai. Jim Greene, 
a partner and president of Richland, LLC, admits that the language barrier can be difficult
when dealing with partners from two different countries working for a client in another part 
of the world. “Foreign nationals appreciate it when you attempt to learn their language,”
says Green, “Even if it is only ‘My name is Jim and welcome to Richland, LLC.’”41 ■
● Be sensitive to cultural differences. When making contacts, setting up business appoint-
ments, or calling on prospective manufacturers in foreign lands, make sure you under-
stand what constitutes accepted business behavior and what does not. This is where your 
research pays off; be sure to study the cultural nuances of doing business in the countries 
you will visit.
● Do your groundwork. Once you locate potential manufacturers, contact them to set up ap-
pointments and go visit them. Preliminary research is essential to finding reliable sources 

610
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
of supply, but “face time” with representatives from various companies allows entrepre-
neurs to judge the intangible factors that can make or break a relationship. Entrepreneurs 
who visit foreign suppliers often find that they receive better service because their suppliers 
know them personally.
● Protect your company’s intellectual property. A common problem that many entrepre-
neurs have encountered with outsourcing is “knockoffs.” Some foreign manufacturers see 
nothing wrong with agreeing to manufacture a product for a company and then selling 
their own knockoff version of it that they manufacture in a “ghost shift.” Securing a non-
disclosure agreement and a contract that prohibits such behavior helps, but experts that 
securing a patent for the item in the source country itself (not just the United States) is a 
good idea.
● Select a manufacturer. Using quality, speed of delivery, level of trust, degree of legal pro-
tection, cost, and other factors, select the manufacturer that can do the job for your company.
● Provide an exact model of the product you want manufactured. Providing a manufac-
turer with an actual model of the item to be manufactured will save lots of time, mistakes,
and problems.
● Stay in constant contact with the manufacturer and try to build a long-term relation-
ship. Communication is a key to building and maintaining a successful relationship with 
a foreign manufacturer. Weekly teleconferences, e-mails, and periodic visits are essen-
tial to making sure that your company gets the performance you expect from a foreign 
manufacturer.
EXPAT ENTREPRENEURS Some entrepreneurs take advantage of opportunities in foreign markets
by actually moving to a country and starting a new business. People who take up residence 
and work in a foreign country are known as expatriates, or more commonly, expats. Expat 
entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs who keep their citizenship in their home country but live and run 
their businesses on foreign soil. American expat entrepreneurs can be found living in countries 
on every continent. Expats from the same home country often form social groups to offer each
other support and keep a little bit of their homeland’s culture active in their lives. American 
expats use social networking sites such as Facebook to help build community and share common 
challenges faced by expat entrepreneurs. Some countries have been making it easier to become 
an expat entrepreneur to encourage economic development. For example, Spain recently cut 
the red tape associated with expats starting businesses to help ease its chronic unemployment 
and low rate of entrepreneurial activity. Although being an expat entrepreneur creates unique
hurdles and problems, those with an adventurous spirit can find amazing experiences starting and 
growing companies in other countries. The following You Be the Consultant feature highlights
t
three expat entrepreneurs who started businesses in Argentina, as told in David English’s book 
Expat Entrepreneurs in Argentina.
Barriers to International Trade
Governments traditionally have used a variety of barriers to block free trade among nations in
an attempt to protect businesses within their own borders. The benefit of protecting their own 
companies, however, comes at the expense of foreign businesses, which face limited access to
global markets. Numerous trade barriers—domestic and international—restrict the freedom of 
businesses in global trading (see Figure 15.5). Even with these barriers, global trade of goods and 
services has grown to nearly $19 trillion.42
Domestic Barriers
Sometimes the biggest barriers potential exporters face are those right here at home. Three major 
domestic roadblocks are common: attitude, information, and financing. Perhaps the biggest bar-
rier to small businesses exporting is the attitude that “My company is too small to export.” That’s
just for big corporations.” The first lesson of exporting is “Take nothing for granted about who

Entrepreneurs who start new businesses in a foreign country, ex-
pat entrepreneurs, can be found in countries all around the globe.
Expat entrepreneurs start new ventures in a foreign land for many
different reasons—the specific opportunity, the desire to live in 
a different country, the wish to leave their home country, or life 
circumstances. Whatever the reason, entrepreneurs face unique
challenges operating businesses in a country other than their
homeland. What follows are profiles of three entrepreneurs from 
a book, Expat Entrepreneurs in Argentina, by David English, who
is an expat himself.
Michael Evans
Michael Evans’s career as an expat entrepreneur in Argentina be-
gan with what he thought was going to be a one-week vacation 
in Mendoza, which is the heart of wine country. What he found
was that Mendoza had none of the amenities of other wine des-
tinations he had visited.
“I came here expecting a consumer-friendly experience like I 
had in Napa, Italy, and France,” says Evans. “But, I couldn’t find it 
anywhere. Argentina felt like a new frontier.”
Evans decided to stay in Mendoza for six months to do re-
search with a potential partner he had met, Pablo Giménez Riili,
whose family had been in the wine business for several decades. 
In addition to having skills, knowledge, and local credibility that
Evans needed for this business, Giménez Riili’s approach to busi-
ness meshed well with Evans’s business philosophies.
The two developed a business plan for a start-up to serve the 
emerging wine industry and its associated tourism. The concepts 
of a small hotel, a wine tasting room, and a direct wine sales busi-
ness emerged from their work together.
“We developed these concepts to solve the problems I had as
a consumer,” says Evans.
The business, The Vines of Mendoza, was successful beyond
any of their plans. The Vines of Mendoza has grown to include op-
erating a wine store in the Park Hyatt Mendoza, managing more 
than 100 private vineyard estates, overseeing a direct wine sales 
business that exports Argentinian wine to the United States, and 
operating their own winery. They also have opened their own five-
star resort for wine tourists.
Carolyn Gallagher
Carolyn Gallagher grew up in Sacramento, California. While she 
was in high school, she became close friends with an exchange 
student from Argentina. Gallagher went to visit her friend in 
Argentina after finishing school, fell in love with the country, and
envisioned moving there some day to settle down. Gallagher went
to college at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where
she studied geography and linguistics. After college she went to
work as a river guide, winery worker, and English tutor for con-
struction companies to save money for her move to Argentina.
In 1998, Gallagher bought a one-way ticket to Mendoza.
“I said to myself, ‘OK, I’m going on an adventure! I don’t 
know what I’ll end up doing, but I’ll figure it out,’” recalls Gallagher.
For two years she taught English. However, she wanted to 
do more than teach. She wanted to start a business. Gallagher re-
turned to California to study cooking, wine making, and business, 
while she worked in the wine industry.
In 2004, Gallagher returned to Argentina ready to find an
opportunity.
“I was on the lookout for niches I could fill in wine and edu-
cation,” she says. “I saw that tourism was taking off, and nobody 
was doing multifaceted tours that combined outdoor adventure
with cooking classes and great wine.”
Gallagher launched her business, Uncorking Argentina, 
which has been successful since it opened. In the meantime, Gal-
lagher married her Argentine boyfriend. The two are now happily 
raising their two children in the country she envisioned living in 
back when she first visited it right after high school.
David English
David English was a technology consultant for Qwest Commu-
nication in New York City on his way to meet with executives of 
CitiGroup to close a contract for a new project. On that sunny 
morning, everything changed. It was September 11, 2001. As he 
left his offices on the way to the meeting, ashes began to fall. 
People were saying that someone had flown a small plane into 
one of the towers of the World Trade Center. English did not think 
much about it. He hopped on the subway to go to his meeting. 
When he emerged from the subway, the city was in chaos from

the attack on the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers. Although
it was several more years before English left America to start his
new life in Argentina, he sees the events of that day as the turning 
point in his life that led him down the path to eventually becom-
ing an expat entrepreneur.
After graduating from college, English had traveled to
Argentina in 1997 through an exchange program run by the
Rotary Club. English spent six weeks in Argentina visiting Rotarians 
in Argentina and touring their businesses.
“When I returned home, I dreamed about Argentina every
night for weeks and immediately made plans to go back and 
see more of the country with which I had fallen in love,” says 
English.
He got that opportunity in 2003. He discovered a niche help-
ing American businesses by serving as their connection with local 
Argentines. He launched English & Associates with a single client
who was developing a wine business in Argentina. English en-
rolled in an MBA program in Argentina that he credits with teach-
ing him about doing business within the culture of Argentina and 
honing his Spanish communication skills.
The scope of his business broadened over time. English &
Associates provides due diligence for foreigners buying real estate 
in Argentina, prepares and files tax returns for nonresident inves-
tors, consults with entrepreneurs looking to start a business in 
Argentina, and develops study-abroad programs in Mendoza for 
leading universities from around the world.
“Being an expat in a place like Argentina is about a lot more 
than running a business,” reflects English. “It’s also about playing 
an active role in the community and looking for opportunities to
be a positive influence.”

CHAPTER 15 • GLOBAL ASPECTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
613
TABLE 15.3 Global Business Assumptions
Old Assumption
New Assumption
Exporting is too risky for my 
small company.
Exporting to “easy” markets such as Canada is no more risky 
than selling to companies in the United States. Each international 
market has its own level of risk. Entrepreneurs can identify the most 
significant risks their companies face and reduce them by using the 
extensive amount of affordable export assistance that is available now.
Getting paid is cumbersome, 
and I’ll lose my shirt.
Trade finance and global banking have evolved to the point where 
buying and selling goods and services internationally is routine, 
safe, and efficient. Reliable collection methods, including credit 
cards, online payments, and letters of credit, are readily available. 
Some delivery firms will collect payment from customers at the 
time of delivery.
Exporting is too complicated.
Most exporting requires minimal paperwork. Often, entrepreneurs 
can research markets and find buyers from their computers using 
free or low-cost information.
My domestic market is secure. 
I don’t need to export.
Globalization has made buying and selling goods in multiple 
markets easy. Few markets remain static, and new markets are 
constantly opening. Most U.S. businesses are involved in or 
affected by international markets, whether they realize it or not. 
More small and medium-size companies have the potential to
benefit from going global, but doing so requires an international 
marketing strategy.
I’m too small to go global.
No company is too small to go global. In fact, 72 percent of U.S. 
exporters have fewer than 20 employees.
My product or service probably 
won’t sell outside the United
States.
If your product or service sells well in the United States, there is a 
good chance you can find a foreign market in which it will sell. In 
addition, help is available for entrepreneurs who want to test the 
appeal of their products and services in more than 100 countries 
around the globe. In some markets, entrepreneurs must make 
modifications to their products and services because of cultural, 
regulatory, or other differences. However, most modifications 
are small and simple to make. In addition, by learning to sell 
successfully in other markets, small companies become stronger 
and better able to compete in all of their markets.
I won’t be successful because 
I don’t speak another language 
and have never been abroad.
Cultural knowledge and business etiquette are important, but you 
can learn as you go. English is the language of business in many 
countries, but you can easily hire translators and interpreters when 
necessary. Researching cultural differences before engaging in 
foreign transactions helps prevents embarrassing faux pas, but a
friendly disposition, a sense of humor, and a willingness to learn 
can make up for many unintended mistakes.

Business Administration, http://www.sba.gov/content/export-loan-programs.
can export and what you can and cannot export” (see Table 15.3). The first step to building an 
export program is recognizing that the opportunity to export exists. Another reason entrepreneurs 
neglect international markets is a lack of information about how to get started. The keys to suc-
cess in international markets are choosing the correct target market and designing the appropri-
ate strategy to reach it. That requires access to information and research. Although a variety of 
government and private organizations make volumes of exporting and international marketing 
information available, many small business owners never use it. A successful global market-
ing strategy also recognizes that not all international markets are the same. Companies must be 
flexible, willing to make adjustments to their products and services, promotional campaigns, 
packaging, and sales techniques.

614
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Brothers Jeff and Tony Logosz grew up enjoying water sports in
the Columbia River Gorge in the state of Washington. They ulti-
mately found a way to turn their passion into a business, launch-
ing Slingshot Sports to design and manufacture kiteboards.
Slingshot Sports helped to create a market for kiteboards,
which were the focus of a relatively new sport at the time. Sling-
shot Sports soon began to find success promoting kiteboarding
and selling its products to a growing market.
One day, a distributor from the United Kingdom showed up 
at the Slingshot Sports offices in North Bonneville, Washington, 
wanting to import its products. Like many small business owners, 
the Logosz brothers had no idea how exporting worked. However,
the request prompted them to learn how to export their prod-
ucts. When they did, they found strong growth in demand for
kiteboards around the globe. Distributors from around the world 
came clamoring for contracts to sell Slingshot Sports Kiteboards.
The company eventually expanded its product line by add-
ing wakeboards. Unlike kiteboards, wakeboards were a well-
established product in a market with many competitors. Rather 
than having global distributors seeking out Slingshot Sports at
the national trade show, the company had to develop a sales
strategy in which the founders traveled to markets around the 
globe to pitch their new wakeboards. The strategy was successful, 
and sales of Slingshot Sports wakeboards soon exceeded all of 
the Logosz’s projections. Following are some of the lessons the
Logosz brothers and other entrepreneurs have learned about
operating a global small business.
Don’t assume that your company has to be big to be 
an international player. As the Logosz brothers learned, 
even very small companies have the opportunity to be suc-
cessful in the global arena. Success in international markets 
does not require size, but it does require commitment and a 
sound strategy.
Know what you don’t know. Perhaps the most important 
item in a global entrepreneur’s briefcase is knowledge. Before
embarking on any international business initiative, entrepre-
neurs should take the time to educate themselves and their 
employees. This chapter is filled with useful resources, many 
of which are free, that are designed to help business owners 
get their global business efforts off to a good start. The start-
ing point for conducting international business successfully is 
learning about best practices for key issues such as identifying 
target markets, developing distribution strategies, complying 
with regulations, adapting products when necessary, collect-
ing payments, and providing customer service.
Build a network of connections. Having a contact in a for-
eign country who can open doors to potential suppliers and 
customers greatly reduces the risk involved in international 
business. Mia Abbruzzese, founder of Morgan & Milo, a chil-
dren’s shoe company, had launched several shoe lines during
her days as an executive for three large global shoe compa-
nies and knew that success in the shoe business requires an 
extensive network of connections in all corners of the globe. 
Using her industry contacts, Abbruzzese found a Taiwanese 
investor who provided start-up capital for Morgan & Milo and 
introduced Abbruzzese to the owner of the factory in south-
ern China that makes many of the shoes that Morgan & Milo
designs. Two other advisers on whom Abbruzzese relies are 
industry veterans who have an extensive network of contacts 
in the shoe industry that have proved to be extremely valu-
able to her company.
Learn about the cultural aspects of conducting business 
in the countries in which your company operates. Busi-
ness dealings are a reflection of a country’s culture, and en-
trepreneurs should educate themselves about the nuances of 
doing business in the host country to avoid committing embar-r
rassing cultural blunders. In the United States, businesspeople 
are transaction oriented. They want to set up an appointment,
negotiate a deal quickly and efficiently, sign a contract, and 
leave. In many other countries, landing a deal takes much 
longer because businesspeople expect to get to know their
potential partners first. Particularly in Asia, businesspeople 
tend to be relationship oriented, doing business only with
people they know, like, and respect. Developing relationships 
can take time, making a network of connections all the more
important. When doing business in Asia, entrepreneurs quickly 
learn that formal contracts, which are the foundation of busi-
ness deals in the United States, are not as important. They also
learn to adjust the speed at which they close deals and take
more time to build relationships with reliable suppliers.
Go there. As Slingshot Sports learned when it expanded into 
wakeboards, building a global business usually requires entre-
preneurs to travel to the countries in which they plan to do 
business. It’s an excellent way to build a network of contacts. 
Participating in international trade missions, attending inter-
national trade shows, and using matching services such as the 
U.S. Department of Commerce’s Gold Key and Platinum Key 
services are ideal methods for connecting with potential cus-
tomers, distributors, and suppliers.
Recognize that foreign sales often put additional 
demands on a company’s cash flow. Expanding a com-
pany’s sales efforts into international markets can strain a 
company’s cash flow, and many traditional lenders are hesi-
tant to extend loans to cover foreign credit sales because they 
perceive the risk to be too great. Help is available for small 
companies, however. The Small Business Administration and 
the Ex-Im Bank offer loan and loan guarantee programs to 
finance small companies’ foreign credit sales. CellAntenna 
Corporation, a maker of cell phone jamming and control 
technology in Coral Springs, Florida, secured a $250,000 line 
of credit through the Small Business Administration’s Export 
Working Capital loan guaranty program to finance its export
sales. The company recently landed a $100,000 order from a 
prison in Australia. “Having a $250,000 line of credit makes it

easy for us to produce the equipment while receiving orders 
from around the world,” says CEO Howard Melamed.
Make sure you collect payments from foreign sales. 
Collecting payments on delinquent foreign sales is more 
involved than collecting payments on delinquent domestic 
sales. The best way to avoid this problem is to sell to custom-
ers who pay their bills on time. That means that conducting 
credit checks before selling to international customers is just 
as important as it is before selling to domestic customers. 
In addition, small companies can reduce the risk of foreign 
credit sales by purchasing export credit insurance from either 
private insurers or from the Ex-Im Bank. CellAntenna Corpo-
ration routinely sells to foreign customers on open account 
but purchases export credit insurance from the Ex-Im Bank to 
mitigate the risk of nonpayment.

An additional obstacle is the inability of small firms to obtain adequate export financing. Finan-
cial institutions that serve small companies often are not experienced in financing international sales 
and are unwilling to accept the perceived higher levels of risk they create for the lender.
International Barriers
Domestic barriers aren’t the only ones that export-minded entrepreneurs must overcome. Trading
nations also erect obstacles to free trade. Two types of international barriers are common: tariff 
and nontariff.
TARIFF BARRIERS A tariff is a tax, or duty, that a government imposes on goods and services 
f
imported into that country. Imposing tariffs raises the price of the imported goods—making 
them less attractive to consumers—and protects the domestic makers of comparable product 
and services. Established in the United States in 1790 by Alexander Hamilton, the tariff system
generated the majority of federal revenues for about 100 years. Currently, the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule, which sets tariffs for products imported into the United States, includes
37,000 categories of goods. The average U.S. tariff on imported goods is 1.74 percent (compared 
to the global average of 2.69 percent).43 American tariffs vary greatly and depend on the particular 
type of good. For instance, inexpensive men’s acrylic sweaters imported into the United States 
carry a 32 percent tariff, but the tariff on cashmere sweaters is 4 percent; cheap sneakers are 
taxed at 48 percent, but golf shoes carry an 8.5 percent tariff.44 Tariff rates also vary among 
nations. Singapore, Switzerland, and Hong Kong impose no tariffs at all on imported goods, but 
Bermuda’s is 15.2 percent.45
NONTARIFF BARRIERS Many nations have lowered the tariffs they impose on products and services 
brought into their borders, but they rely on other nontariff structures as protectionist trade barriers.
Quotas Rather than impose a direct tariff on certain imported products, nations often use quotas 
to protect their industries. A quota is a limit on the amount of a product imported into a country.
Those who favor quotas argue that they protect domestic industries and the jobs they create. 
Those who oppose quotas say that they artificially raise prices on the restricted goods, imposing 
a hidden tax on customers who purchase them. China imposes a quota on foreign films, allowing 
only 34 foreign films to be released each year. Before 2012, the quota was 20 foreign films per 
year. China’s total box office sales are $3.57 billion annually, the third largest in the world, and 
its box office sales are predicted to exceed $5 billion by 2015. China has 4,582 cinema complexes 
and 18,195 movie screens, with more than 5,000 screens added just in 2013. Despite pressure
from the World Trade Organization (WTO) to eliminate the film quota, Chinese officials have
refused, expressing concern that removing the barrier would unleash a flood of foreign films that 
might wipe out the local film industry.46

Embargoes An embargo is a total ban on imports of certain products. The motivation for 
embargoes is not always economic; it also can involve political differences, environmental 
disputes, war, terrorism, and other issues. For instance, the United States imposes embargoes 
on products from nations it considers to be adversarial, including Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and North 
Korea, among others. An embargo on trade with Cuba, started in 1962 when Fidel Castro 
nationalized all U.S. businesses on the island nation and formed an alliance with the Soviet 
Union, still exists today. In 1994, the United States lifted a total trade embargo on Vietnam that 
had stood since 1975, when Saigon fell into communist hands at the end of the Vietnam War. 
Today, the United States imports $24.6 billion worth of goods from Vietnam and exports goods 
worth $5.0 billion.47
Embargoes also originate from cultural differences. For instance, the United States imposes
embargoes on any harp seal products from Norway under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. 
Norway, where seal products make up a multi-million-dollar industry, has pushed for the elimina-
tion of the embargo, arguing that harp seals are not an endangered species.48
Dumping In an effort to grab market share quickly, some companies have been guilty of dumping
products: selling large quantities of them at prices that are below cost in foreign countries. The
United States has been a dumping ground for steel, televisions, shoes, and computer chips from 
other nations in the past. Under the U.S. Antidumping Act, a company must prove that the foreign 
company’s prices are lower here than in the home country and that U.S. companies are directly
harmed. Disputes over dumping brought before the WTO have increased significantly over the
last five years, and China has been the target of most of the complaints from WTO member 
nations. The U.S. Department of Commerce, without the involvement of the WTO, recently ruled
that government-subsidized makers of solar cells and panels in China were guilty of dumping 
their products in the United States at prices that average 31 percent below “fair value.” SolarWorld
Industries America and six other U.S.-based solar cell and panel manufacturers initiated the
charge, claiming that artificially low prices on solar products from China are crippling the
domestic industry. As part of its ruling, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed punitive 
dumping margins (the difference between the fair value of the items and their actual export price) 
of 31 percent on the Chinese companies.49
Political Barriers
Entrepreneurs who go global quickly discover a labyrinth of political tangles. Although many 
U.S. business owners complain of excessive government regulation in the United States, they
are often astounded by the onerous web of governmental and legal regulations and barriers they 
encounter in foreign countries. One entrepreneur who established a business location in Russia
says he had to visit more than two dozen agencies to complete the necessary paperwork and get 
90 different documents signed.50
Companies doing business in politically risky lands face the very real dangers of govern-
ment takeovers of private property; coups to overthrow ruling parties; kidnapping, bombings, 
and other violent acts against businesses and their employees; and other threatening events. Their 
investments of millions of dollars may evaporate overnight in the wake of a government coup 
or the passage of a law nationalizing an industry (giving control of an entire industry to the 
government).
Business Barriers
American companies doing business internationally quickly learn that business practices and
regulations in foreign lands can be quite different from those in the United States. Simply dupli-
cating the practices they have adopted (and have used successfully) in the domestic market and 
using them in foreign markets is not always a good idea. Perhaps the biggest shock comes in the
area of human resources management, in which international managers discover that practices 
common in the United States, such as overtime and employee benefits, are restricted, disfa-
vored, or forbidden in other cultures. Business owners new to international business sometimes
are shocked at the wide range of labor costs they encounter and the accompanying wide range 
of skilled labor available. In some countries, what appear to be “bargain” labor rates turn out 
to be excessively high after accounting for the quality of the labor force and the benefits their

governments mandate: from company-sponsored housing, meals, and clothing to profit sharing 
and extended vacations. For instance, laws in many European countries mandate a minimum 
of 20 days of vacation in addition to paid holidays, giving workers there an average of nearly 
35 days off per year.51 Some countries’ labor laws make it extremely difficult or even impossible
to terminate employees once hired. Hefty taxes, ineffective legal systems, corruption, and shady 
business associates can make doing business in foreign countries difficult.
Cultural Barriers
Even though travel and communications technology has increased the ease and the frequency 
with which entrepreneurs engage in global transactions, the potential for cultural blunders has 
increased. The culture of a nation includes the beliefs, values, views, and mores its inhabitants
share. Differences in cultures among nations create another barrier to international trade. The 
diversity of languages, business philosophies, practices, and traditions make international trade 
more complex than selling to the business down the street. Consider the following examples:
● A U.S. entrepreneur, eager to expand into the European Union, arrives at the headquarters 
of his company’s potential business partner in France. Confidently, he strides into the meet-
ing room, enthusiastically pumps his host’s hand, slaps him on the back, and says, “Tony, 
I’ve heard a great deal about you; please, call me Bill.” Eager to explain the benefits of 
his product, he opens his briefcase and gets right down to business. The French executive 
politely excuses himself and leaves the room before negotiations ever begin, shocked by 
the American’s rudeness and ill manners. Rudeness and ill manners? Yes—from the French 
executive’s perspective.
● Another American business owner flies to Tokyo to close a deal with a Japanese executive.
He is pleased when his host invites him to play a round of golf shortly after he arrives. He
plays well and manages to win by a few strokes. The Japanese executive invites him to play
again the next day, and again he wins by a few strokes. Invited to play another round the 
following day, the American asks, “But when are we going to start doing business?” His 
host, surprised by the question, says, “But we have been doing business.”
● An American businesswoman in London is invited to a party hosted by an advertising 
agency. Unsure of her ability to navigate the streets and subways of London alone, she 
approaches a British colleague who is driving to the party and asks him, “Could I get a ride 
with you?” After he turns bright red from embarrassment, he regains his composure and
politely says, “Lucky for you I know what you meant.” Unknowingly, the young woman 
had requested a sexual encounter with her colleague, not a lift to the party!52
● One pharmaceutical company was about to market a weight loss pill under the name Tegro, 
which sounds harmless enough in English. However, phonetically, the word sounds identi-
cal to the French phrase t’es gros, which translates “You are fat.” Another global company 
attempted to market a technology training system whose name sounded exactly like the 
Korean phrase for “porn movie.”53
When American businesspeople enter international markets for the first time, they often are 
amazed at the differences in foreign cultures’ habits and customs. In the first scenario above, for 
instance, had the entrepreneur done his homework, he would have known that the French are 
very formal (backslapping is definitely taboo!) and do not typically use first names in business
relationships (even among longtime colleagues). In the second scenario, a global manager would 
have known that the Japanese place a tremendous importance on developing personal relation-
ships before committing to any business deals. Thus, he would have seen the golf games for what 
they really were: an integral part of building a business relationship.
Understanding and heeding these often subtle cultural differences is one of the most impor-
tant keys to international business success. Conducting a business meeting with a foreign execu-
tive in the same manner as one with an American businessperson could doom the deal from the 
outset. Business customs and behaviors that are acceptable, even expected, in the United States
may be taboo in others, and entrepreneurs who fail to learn the differences in the habits and cus-
toms of the cultures in which they hope to do business are at a distinct disadvantage.

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Aloompa Aloompa is
an app development business located in Nashville, Ten-
nessee, that specializes primarily in apps for music festivals. Its 
first customer was the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in 
Manchester, Tennessee. The app includes a map of the festival
grounds, including the location of food vendors, bathrooms, 
retail spaces, and stages. It also includes bios of performers, 
audio samples of performers’ music, and reviews that can be 
pushed out to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. After grow-
ing to more than two dozen music festivals in the United 
States, Aloompa expanded to international festivals. The first
was the Playa del Carmen in Mexico. The app for this festival is
available in both English and Spanish. Aloompa is quickly add-
ing new festivals for customers in Asia, Europe, and South
America. “As Aloompa expanded into the international mar-
ket, it has had to learn how to communicate across culture bar-
riers and familiarize itself with a variety of business practices
across the globe,” says Caleb Jones in Business Development
for Aloompa. “For example, as we expanded we found it nec-
essary to start our deals in the South American market a full 
month prior due to slower timelines. As we move further into 
the international market, it has given us an appreciation for 
the vast array of cultures that make up international commerce, and a great desire to continue 
business ventures abroad.”54  ■
Culture, customs, and the norms of behavior differ greatly among nations, and making the
correct impression is extremely critical to building a long-term business relationship. Consider 
the following examples:
● In Europe and China, just as in the United States, punctuality for business meetings is 
important. In Latin America, Africa, and many Middle Eastern countries, however, business
meetings rarely start at the scheduled time, something that does not seem to bother locals.
● In Great Britain, businesspeople consider it extremely important to conduct business
“properly”—with formality and reserve. Boisterous behavior such as backslapping or 
overindulging in alcohol and ostentatious displays of wealth are considered ill mannered. 
The British do not respond to hard-sell tactics but do appreciate well-mannered executives.
Politeness and impeccable manners are useful tools for conducting business successfully.
● In Colombia, foreigners are expected to be on time for meetings, although native
Colombians are rarely punctual. Be ready to wait. Once the meeting begins, Colombians 
stand closer together when talking. However, unlike many other South Americans, they 
engage in less physical contact during a conversation. Be ready for relaxed conversa-
tion before getting down to business. It is considered rude to jump right into business 
discussions.55
● In India, a limp handshake and avoiding eye contact are not signs of weakness or dislike;
they convey respect.56
● When doing business in Greece, U.S. executives must be thoughtful of their hand gestures; 
the hand-waving gesture that means “good-bye” in the United States is considered an insult 
in Greece.57
● In Japan and South Korea, exchanging business cards, known in Japan as meishi, is an im-
portant business function (unlike in Great Britain, where exchanging business cards is less
popular). A Western executive who accepts a Japanese companion’s card and then slips it 
into his pocket or scribbles notes on it has committed a major blunder. Tradition there says 
that a business card must be treated just as its owner would be—with respect. Travelers 
should present their own cards using both hands with the card positioned so that the recipi-
ent can read it. (The flip side should be printed in Japanese, an expected courtesy.)

● Business attire is very important when doing business in Argentina. Business dress is 
conservative, with men and women generally wearing dark suits. Eye contact should be 
maintained throughout a business conversation.58
● Exercise caution when giving gifts. Although gift giving is standard practice in Japan, busi-
nesspeople in other countries, such as Malaysia, may see a gift as a bribe. In many coun-
tries, gifts of flowers are considered inappropriate because they connote romantic attention. 
In South Korea, giving a clock as a gift is considered good luck, but in China, it is consid-
ered a bad omen.59 Avoid giving gifts to business associates that are traditional symbols of 
their own cultures, such as chocolates to the Swiss or tea to the Chinese.
● In China, entrepreneurs will need an ample dose of the “three Ps”: patience, patience, and
patience. Nothing in China—especially business—happens fast, and entrepreneurs wanting to 
do business there must be persistent! In conversation and negotiations, periods of silence are
common; they are a sign of politeness and contemplation. The Chinese view personal space
much differently than Americans; in normal conversation, they will stand much closer to their 
partners. At a business meal, sampling every dish, no matter how exotic, is considered polite.
In addition, do not expect to conduct business the week before or after the Chinese New Year 
(“Yuandan”), whose dates vary from year to year, when many businesses are closed.
● Starting business relationships with customers in the Pacific Rim usually requires a third-
party contact because Asian executives prefer to do business with people they know. In 
addition, building personal relationships is important. Many business deals take place over 
informal activities in this part of the world. American entrepreneurs doing business in the 
Pacific Rim should avoid hard-sell techniques, which are an immediate turnoff to Asian 
businesspeople. Harmony, patience, and consensus make good business companions in this 
region. It is also a good idea to minimize the importance of legal documents in negotia-
tions. Although getting deals and trade agreements down in writing always is advisable,
attempting to negotiate detailed contracts (as most American businesses tend to do) would 
insult most Asians, who base their deals on mutual trust and benefits.
International Trade Agreements
With the fundamental assumption that free trade among nations results in enhanced economic 
prosperity for all parties involved, the last 50 years have witnessed a gradual opening of trade 
among nations. Hundreds of agreements have been negotiated among nations in this period, with 
each contributing to free trade across the globe. Although completely free trade across interna-
tional borders remains elusive, the following trade agreements have reduced some of the barriers 
to free trade that had stood for many years.
WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in January 
1995 and replaced the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the first global tariff 
agreement, which was created in 1947 and was designed to reduce tariffs among member nations. 
The WTO, currently with 160 member countries, is the only international organization that 
establishes rules for trade among nations. Its member countries represent more than 97 percent of 
all world trade. The rules and agreements of the WTO, called the multilateral trading system, are the 
result of negotiations among its members. The WTO actively implements the rules established by 
the Uruguay Round negotiations of GATT from 1986 to 1994 and continues to negotiate additional 
trade agreements. The ninth round of negotiations, the Doha Development Agenda, began in 2001. 
As of 2014, there was still no definitive conclusion to this round of negotiations. Through the 
agreements of the WTO, members commit themselves to nondiscriminatory trade practices and to 
reducing barriers to free trade. The WTO’s agreements spell out the rights and obligations of each 
member country. Each member country receives guarantees that its exports will be treated fairly 
and consistently in other member countries’ markets. The WTO’s General Agreement on Trade 
in Services addresses specific industries, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, and
tourism. In addition, the WTO’s intellectual property agreement, which covers patents, copyrights, 
and trademarks, defines rules for protecting ideas and creativity across borders.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
In addition to the development of agreements among members, the WTO is involved in 
the resolution of trade disputes among members. The WTO system is designed to encourage
dispute resolutions through consultation. If this approach fails, the WTO has a stage-by-stage 
procedure that can culminate in a ruling by a panel of experts.
NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
created a free trade area among Canada, Mexico, and the United States. A free trade area is an
a
association of countries that have agreed to eliminate trade barriers, both tariff and nontariff, among
partner nations. Under the provisions of NAFTA, these barriers were eliminated for trade among the
three countries, but each remained free to set its own tariffs on imports from nonmember nations.
NAFTA forged one of the world’s largest free trade areas, a unified United States–Canada–
Mexico market of 465 million people with a total annual output of $20.1 trillion in goods and 
services.60 This important trade agreement binds together the three nations on the North American 
continent into a single trading unit stretching from the Yukon to the Yucatan. NAFTA’s provisions 
called for the reduction of tariffs to zero on most goods traded among these three nations. NAFTA’s 
provisions have enhanced trade among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Since NAFTA’s 
passage in 1994, total trade between the United States and Mexico has increased 522 percent, and 
total trade with Canada has increased 200 percent.61 It also has made that trade more profitable and
less cumbersome for companies of all sizes and has opened new opportunities for many businesses.
Since NAFTA’s passage, trade among the three nations has more than tripled; these countries now
conduct nearly $3.1 billion in trilateral trade each day!62
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tanya Shaw: Unique Solutions In 2002, Tanya Shaw 
launched Unique Solutions, a company based in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, that markets the 
Intellifit Virtual Fitting Room, a high-tech scanner that is capable of capturing 200,000 measure-
ments on a fully clothed person in just 20 seconds. After a visit to a mall or retail store for a brief 
scan, customers receive a report that gives them key body measurements they can use to purchase 
made-to-measure garments from a database of companies that Unique Solutions maintains or to
make shopping for off-the-rack clothing more a more pleasant and efficient experience. The com-
pany’s Me-Ality shopping guide matches shoppers’ body shapes with specific sizes at retailers 
ranging from Banana Republic and Coldwater Creek to J. Crew and Talbot’s. Shaw decided to 
leave the company’s headquarters in Nova Scotia, but because NAFTA created opportunities in the 
United States and Mexico, she moved her marketing and sales division to California and partnered
with a New Zealand company, TJ’s Jeanswear, that has a factory in Parras, Mexico. TJ’s Jeanswear 
produces and delivers custom-made jeans to Unique Solutions customers. Shaw credits the col-
laborative business environment created by NAFTA as her small business sought the formation of 
international partnerships.63  ■
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC–CENTRAL AMERICA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT The Dominican Republic–
Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) is to Central America what NAFTA is to 
North America. The agreement, which was implemented in stages between 2006 and 2008, is
designed to promote free trade among the United States and six Central American countries: Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua. In addition 
to reducing tariffs among these nations, CAFTA-DR protects U.S. companies’ investments and
intellectual property in the region, simplifies the export process for U.S. companies, and provides 
easier access to Central American markets.
Conclusion
To remain competitive, small businesses must assume a global posture. Global effectiveness 
requires entrepreneurs to be able to leverage workers’ skills, company resources, and customer 
know-how across borders and throughout cultures across the world. They also must concen-
trate on maintaining competitive cost structures and a focus on the core of every business—the 
customer! Although there are no surefire rules for going global, small businesses that want to 
become successful international competitors should observe these guidelines:
● Take the time to learn about doing business globally before jumping in. Avoiding mistakes 
is easier and less expensive than cleaning up the results of mistakes later.

● If you have never conducted international business, consider hiring a trade intermediary 
or finding a local partner to help you.
● Make yourself at home in all three of the world’s key markets: North America, Europe, and 
Asia. This triad of regions is forging a new world order in trade that will dominate global 
markets for years to come.
● Appeal to the similarities within the various regions in which you operate but recognize the 
differences in their specific cultures. Although the European Union is a single trading bloc 
composed of 28 countries, smart entrepreneurs know that each country has its own cultural 
uniqueness and do not treat the nearly 507 million people in them as a unified market. “Gone 
are the days when you could just roll out one product for the global market,” says Hamad 
Malik, Middle East marketing director for the South Korean electronics company LG.64
● Develop new products for the world market. Make sure your products and services measure 
up to world-class quality standards.
● Familiarize yourself with foreign customs and languages. Constantly scan, clip, and build 
a file on other cultures: their lifestyles, values, customs, and business practices.
● Learn to understand your customers from the perspective of their culture, not your own.
r
Bridge cultural gaps by adapting your business practices to suit their preferences and 
customs.
● “Glocalize.” Make global decisions about products, markets, and management but allow
local employees to make tactical decisions about packaging, advertising, and service.
● Recruit and retain multicultural workers who can give your company meaningful insight 
into the intricacies of global markets. Entrepreneurs with a truly global perspective iden-
tify, nurture, and use the talents and knowledge multicultural workers possess.
● Train employees to think globally, send them on international trips, and equip them with 
state-of-the-art communications technology.
● Hire local managers to staff foreign offices and branches.
● Do whatever seems best wherever it seems best, even if people at home lose jobs or 
responsibilities.
● Consider using partners and joint ventures to break into foreign markets you cannot 
penetrate on your own.
● Evaluate opportunities to become an expat entrepreneur.
By its very nature, going global can be a frightening experience. Most entrepreneurs who have 
already made the jump, however, have found that the benefits outweigh the risks and that their 
companies are much stronger because of it.

declines in the domestic market; increasing sales 
and profits; extending their products’ life cycles; 
lowering manufacturing costs; improving competi-
tive position; raising quality levels; and becoming
more customer oriented.
2. Describe the principal strategies small 
businesses have for going global.
●Perhaps the simplest and least expensive way for a 
small business to begin conducting business glob-
ally is to establish a Web site. Companies that sell 
goods on the Web should establish a secure ordering 
and payment system for online customers.
●Trade intermediaries, such as EMCs, ETCs, MEAs,
export merchants, resident buying offices, and

3. Discuss the major barriers to international 
trade and their impact on the global economy.
●Three domestic barriers to international trade are 
common: the attitude that “we’re too small to ex-
port,” lack of information on how to get started in 
global trade, and a lack of available financing.
●International barriers include tariffs, quotas, embar-
goes, dumping, and political, business, and cultural 
barriers.
4. Describe the trade agreements that will have 
the greatest influence on foreign trade in the 
twenty-first century.
●The WTO was established in 1995 to implement the 
rules established by the Uruguay Round negotia-
tions of GATT from 1986 to 1994, and it continues 
to negotiate additional trade agreements. The WTO 
has 160 member nations and represents more than 
97 percent of all global trade. The WTO is the 
governing body that resolves trade disputes among
members.
●NAFTA created a free trade area among Canada, 
Mexico, and the United States. The agreement cre-
ated an association that knocked down trade bar-
riers, both tariff and nontariff, among the partner 
nations.
●CAFTA-DR created a free trade area among the 
United States and six nations in Central America: 
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, the 
Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua. In addition to 
reducing tariffs among these nations, CAFTA pro-
tects U.S. companies’ investments and intellectual
property in the region, simplifies the export process 
for U.S. companies, and provides easier access to
Central American markets.
foreign distributors, can serve as a small company’s 
“export department.”
●In a domestic joint venture, two or more U.S. small 
companies form an alliance for the purpose of ex-
porting their goods and services abroad. In a foreign 
joint venture, a domestic small business forms an 
alliance with a company in the target area.
●Some small businesses enter foreign markets by 
licensing businesses in other nations to use their 
patents, trademarks, copyrights, technology, pro-
cesses, or products.
●Franchising has become a major export industry 
for the United States. Franchisers that enter foreign 
markets rely on three strategies: direct franchising, 
area development, and master franchising.
●Some countries lack a hard currency that is convert-
ible into other currencies, so companies doing busi-
ness there must rely on countertrading or bartering. 
A countertrade is a transaction in which a business 
selling goods in a foreign country agrees to promote 
investment and trade in that country. Bartering in-
volves trading goods and services for other goods 
and services.
●Once established in international markets, some 
small businesses set up permanent locations there. 
Although they can be very expensive to establish
and maintain, international locations give businesses
the opportunity to stay in close contact with their 
international customers.
●Many small companies shop the world for the goods 
and services they sell. The intensity of price compe-
tition has made importing and outsourcing success-
ful strategies for many small businesses.
●Some entrepreneurs choose to exploit opportunities 
in foreign markets by moving to those countries and 
becoming expat entrepreneurs.

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
625
Leadership: An Essential Part of an Entrepreneur’s Job
To be successful, an entrepreneur must assume a wide range of roles, tasks, and responsibilities,
but none is more important than the role of leader. Some entrepreneurs are uncomfortable assum-
ing this role, but they must learn to be effective leaders if their companies are to grow and reach 
their potential. Leadership is the process of influencing and inspiring others to work to achieve a 
common goal and then giving them the power and the freedom to achieve it. Without leadership 
ability, entrepreneurs—and their companies—never rise above mediocrity. Entrepreneurs can
learn to be effective leaders, but the task requires dedication, discipline, and hard work. In the 
past, business owners often relied on an autocratic management style, one built on command and
control. Today’s workforce is more knowledgeable, has more options, and is more skilled and, 
as a result, expects a different, more sophisticated style of leadership. Mark Leslie, founder of 
Veritas Software and under whose leadership the company grew from $95,000 in annual sales to 
more than $1.5 billion in sales in just 11 years, says leadership is no longer about command and 
control. Companies must attract the best and brightest people and create an environment in which 
they can use their intelligence and judgment to make decisions.1
The rapid pace of change shaping the economy also is placing new demands on leaders.
Technology is changing the ways in which people work, the ways in which the various parts of 
an organization operate and interconnect, and the ways in which competitors strive for market 
dominance. To remain competitive, companies must operate at a new, faster speed of business, 
and that requires a new style of leadership. Leaders of small companies must gather information 
and make decisions with lightning-fast speed, and they must give workers the resources and the 
freedom to solve problems and exploit opportunities as they arise. Effective leaders delegate 
authority and responsibility and empower employees to act in the best interest of the business. In
this way, leaders demonstrate trust in employees and respect for their ability to make decisions. 
Many entrepreneurs have discovered that the old style of leadership has lost its effectiveness and
that they must develop a new, more fluid, flexible style of leadership that better fits the needs of 
modern workers and competitive conditions.
Until recently, experts compared a leader’s job to that of a symphony orchestra conductor. 
Like the symphony leader, an entrepreneur made sure that everyone in the company was play-
ing the same score, coordinated individual efforts to produce a harmonious sound, and directed 
the orchestra members as they played. The conductor (entrepreneur) retained virtually all of the
power and made all of the decisions about how the orchestra would play the music without any 
input from the musicians themselves. Today’s successful entrepreneur, however, is more like the 
leader of a jazz band, which is known for its improvisation, innovation, creativity, and freewheel-
ing style. “The success of a small [jazz band] rests on the ability to be agile and flexible, skills 
that are equally central to today’s business world,” says Michael Gold, founder of Jazz Impact, a
company that teaches management skills through jazz.2 Business leaders, like the leaders of jazz
bands, should exhibit the following characteristics:
Innovative. Leaders must step out of their own comfort zones to embrace new ideas; they 
avoid the comfort of complacency.
Passionate. One of entrepreneurs’ greatest strengths is their passion for their businesses. 
Members of their team feed off of that passion and draw inspiration from it.
Willing to take risks. Playing it safe “is not an option in jazz or for any company that 
wants to be solvent ten years from now,” says Gold.3
Adaptable. Although leaders must stand on a bedrock of resolute values, like jazz band 
leaders, they must adapt their leadership styles to fit the situation and the people involved.
Management and leadership are not the same, yet both are essential to a company’s success. 
Leadership without management is unbridled; management without leadership is uninspired. 
Leadership gets a small business going; management keeps it going. In other words, leaders are
the architects of small businesses; managers are the builders. Some entrepreneurs are good man-
agers yet are poor leaders; others are powerful leaders but are weak managers. The best bet for 
the latter is to hire people with solid management skills to help them to execute the vision they

have for their companies. Stephen Covey, author of Principle-Centered Leadership, explains the
difference between management and leadership in this way:
Leadership deals with people; management deals with things. You manage things; you lead
people. Leadership deals with vision; management deals with logistics toward that vision. 
Leadership deals with doing the right things; management focuses on doing things right. 
Leadership deals with examining the paradigms on which you are operating; management 
operates within those paradigms. Leadership comes first, then management, but both are 
necessary.4
Leadership and management are intertwined; one without the other means that a small busi-
ness is going nowhere. Leadership is especially important for companies in the growth phase, 
when entrepreneurs are hiring employees (often for the first time) and must keep the com-
pany and everyone in it focused on its mission as growth tests every seam in the organizational
structure.
Effective leaders exhibit certain behaviors:
● They define and then constantly reinforce the vision they have for the company. Effec-
tive leaders have a clear vision of where they want their companies to go, and they concen-
trate on communicating that vision to those around them. Unfortunately, this is one area in 
which employees say their leaders could do a better job. Clarity of purpose is essential to 
a successful organization because people want to be a part of something that is bigger than 
they are; however, the purpose must be more than merely achieving continuous quarterly 
profits. Nick Saban, one of the most successful college coaches in recent memory, says a 
clear vision is the first ingredient for any successful organization. The others are a plan to 
implement the vision, a leader who sets a good example and develops principles and values
that support the vision, and convincing people to buy into the vision.5
In the 1930s, Walt Disney asked his team of animators to stay late one evening be-
cause he had a vision that would transform his company: Rather than continue making the 
short cartoons the company had become known for, he wanted to make the first full-length 
animated movie, a concept that at the time was revolutionary. Over the course of three and 
a half hours, Disney created an unmistakable vision for the young company by acting out 
all of the parts of the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Not only was the 
movie a commercial and critical success (becoming the top grossing movie of all time until 
it was unseated in 1939 by Gone with the Wind) and winning a special Academy award 
(a full-size Oscar accompanied by seven “dwarf” Oscars), it paved the way for dozens of 
other full-length animated films and transformed the entire company into an entertainment 
powerhouse.6
● They create a set of values and beliefs for employees and passionately pursue them. 
Values are the foundation on which a company’s vision is built. Leaders should be like bea-
cons in the night, constantly shining light on the principles, values, and beliefs on which 
they founded their companies. Whenever the opportunity presents itself, entrepreneurs 
must communicate with clarity the company’s bedrock values and principles to employees 
and other stakeholders. Some entrepreneurs may not think that it is necessary to do so, but 
successful leaders know they must hammer home the connection between their companies’ 
values and mission and the jobs workers perform every day.
● They establish a culture of ethics. One of the most important tasks facing leaders is to 
mold a highly ethical culture for their companies. They also must demonstrate the character 
and the courage necessary to stick to the ethical standards they create—especially in the 
face of difficulty.
● They develop a strategic plan that gives the company a competitive advantage. Ideally,
employees participate in building a successful strategic plan, but the leader is the principal 
strategic architect of the company. The leader also is responsible for implementing the plan 
with flexibility and the ability to adapt it to changing conditions.
● They respect and support their employees. To gain the respect of their employees, lead-
ers must first respect those who work for them. Successful leaders treat every employee 

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
627
with respect. They know that a loyal, dedicated workforce is a company’s most valuable
resource, and they treat their employees that way.
● They set the example for their employees. Leaders’ words ring hollow if they fail to 
“practice what they preach.” Few signals are transmitted to workers faster than a leader 
who sells employees on one set of values and principles and then acts according to a 
different set. This behavior quickly undermines a leader’s credibility among employees, 
who expect leaders to “walk their talk.” That is why integrity is perhaps the most important 
determinant of a leader’s effectiveness.
● They are authentic. Employees quickly see through leaders who only pretend to be what 
they are not. Authenticity does not make someone a leader, but a leader cannot be success-
ful without it. Authenticity is a vital part in developing trust among employees. Successful
leaders follow the philosophy of Popeye, the spinach-munching, crusty sailor who first 
appeared in a cartoon strip in 1929 and was famous for saying, “I yam what I yam, and 
that’s all what I yam.”7
● They create a climate of trust in the organization. Leaders who demonstrate integrity 
win the trust of their employees, an essential ingredient in the success of any organiza-
tion. Honest, open communication and a consistent pattern of leaders doing what they say 
they will do serve to build trust in a business. Research suggests that building trust among 
employees is one of the most important tasks of leaders wherever they may work. A re-
cent survey of the CEOs of the 500 fastest-growing small companies in the United States, 
top managers said the most important traits of outstanding leaders were trustworthiness, 
sincerity, and the capacity to inspire.8
● They build credibility with their employees. To be effective, leaders must have credibility 
with their employees, a sometimes challenging task for entrepreneurs, especially as their 
companies grow and they become insulated from the daily activities of their businesses. To 
combat the problem of losing touch with the problems their employees face as they do their 
jobs, many managers periodically return to the front line to serve customers. Undercover 
Boss, a popular television show, disguises CEOs and sends them to work in frontline jobs 
in their companies. In addition to seeing just how difficult many jobs can be, all of the 
CEOs get a superb refresher course in how important every worker’s role is to the success 
of the company and how the policies they and other top managers create often make work-
ers’ jobs harder. Michael Rubin, founder and CEO of GSI Commerce, a company that pro-
vides distribution and call center services, learned so much from his frontline experience 
that he now requires all of the GSI’s executives to spend time working in the company’s 
warehouses and call centers. The idea is that top managers will make better decisions about 
policies and procedures if they see firsthand the impact of those decisions on customers 
and frontline employees. When 7-Eleven CEO Joe DePinto went undercover, an encounter 
with a talented night-shift clerk who was considering leaving the company for a brighter 
future elsewhere led him to implement a “talent identification program” designed to 
promote promising employees within the company.9
● They focus employees’ efforts on challenging goals and keep them driving toward those 
goals. When asked by a student intern to define leadership, one entrepreneur said, “Leadership 
is the ability to convince people to follow a path they have never taken before to a place they 
have never been—and upon finding it to be successful, to do it over and over again.”10
● They provide the resources employees need to achieve their goals. Effective leaders know 
that workers cannot do their jobs well unless they have the tools they need. They provide 
workers not only with the physical resources they need to excel but also with the necessary 
intangible resources, such as training, coaching, and mentoring.
● They communicate with their employees. Leaders recognize that helping workers to see 
the company’s overarching goal is just one part of effective communication; encouraging 
employee feedback and then listening is just as vital. In other words, they know that com-
munication is a two-way street. Open communication takes on even greater importance 
when a company faces a difficult or uncertain future.

628
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
● They value the diversity of their workers. Smart business leaders recognize the value of 
their workers’ varied skills, abilities, backgrounds, and interests. When channeled in the 
right direction, diversity can be a powerful weapon in achieving innovation and maintain-
ing a competitive edge. Good leaders get to know their workers and to understand the di-
versity of their strengths. Especially important to young workers is a leader’s capacity for 
empathy, the ability to see things from another person’s viewpoint.
● They celebrate their workers’ successes. Effective leaders recognize that workers want 
to be winners, and they do everything they can to encourage top performance among their 
people. The rewards they give are not always financial; in many cases, it may be as simple
as a handwritten congratulatory note.
● They are willing to take risks. Entrepreneurs know better than most that launching a busi-
ness requires taking risks. They also understand that to remain competitive, they must 
constantly encourage risk taking in their companies. When employees try something inno-
vative and it fails, they don’t resort to punishment because they know that doing so would 
squelch creativity in the organization.
● They encourage creativity among their workers. Rather than punish workers who take 
risks and fail, effective leaders are willing to accept failure as a natural part of innova-
tion and creativity. They know that innovative behavior is the key to future success and do 
everything they can to encourage it among workers.
● They maintain a sense of humor. One of the most important tools a leader can have is
a sense of humor. Without it, work can become dull and unexciting for everyone.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Richard Branson: Virgin Group Sir Richard Branson,
founder of Virgin Group, a diversified company whose businesses range from airlines 
and bridal gowns to cosmetics and consumer electronics, is famous for creating a work envi-
ronment of fun for himself and his employees. Branson has put on a wedding dress, bungee 
jumped, and hosted off-site events designed strictly to allow employees to have fun. The
culture of fun at Virgin Group has built an ésprit de corps that gives the company a unique
advantage that competitors find difficult to match, and crown prince Richard Branson is its 
architect.11 ■
● They create an environment in which people have the motivation, the training, and the 
freedom to achieve the goals they have set. Leaders know that their success is determined
r
by the success of their followers. The goal is to make every employee the manager of his or 
her job. The leader’s role is to provide employees with the resources and support they need 
to be successful.
● They create a work climate that encourages maximum performance. Leaders understand 
that they play a significant role in shaping a company culture that sets high standards of 
performance. Anne Wojcicki, founder of 23andMe, a genetic testing company, says her 
primary role is to get everyone in the company to think bigger.12
● They become a catalyst for change. With market and competitive climates changing so
rapidly, entrepreneurs must reinvent their companies constantly. Although leaders must 
cling to the values and principles that form the bedrock of their companies, they must be 
willing to change, sometimes radically, the policies, procedures, and processes within their 
businesses. If a company is headed in the wrong direction, the leader’s job is to recognize 
that and to get the company moving in the right direction.
● They develop leadership talent. Effective leaders look beyond themselves to spot tomor-
row’s leaders and take the time to help them grow into their leadership potential. A vital 
component of every leader’s job is to develop the next generation of leaders.
● They keep their eyes on the horizon. Effective leaders are never satisfied with what they 
and their employees accomplished yesterday. They know that yesterday’s successes are not 
enough to sustain their companies indefinitely. They see the importance of building and 
maintaining sufficient momentum to carry their companies to the next level. “A leader’s job 

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
629
is to rally people toward a better future,” says Marcus Buckingham, who has spent nearly 
two decades studying effective leaders.13 Just like winning athletes, good leaders visualize 
a successful future and then work to make it happen.
Table 16.1 presents 12 questions leaders should address if they want their companies to excel.
TABLE 16.1 12 Questions That Every Leader Should Address
Jim Collins, coauthor of business best-sellers Good to Great and 
t
Great by Choice, has spent 25 years researching great companies 
and has integrated the results of his research into 12 questions that leaders must address if they want their companies to excel. Collins 
advises leaders to discuss one of the following questions every month and repeat the process annually:
1. Do we want to build a great company, and are we committed to doing the things that are required to make our company 
great? Becoming a great company starts by making this fundamental choice, understanding the implications of choosing to build 
a great company, and then making the commitment to take the necessary steps to achieve greatness.
2. Do we have the right people on the bus and in the key seats? Leaders must decide whether the people who will carry the 
company forward are the right people. Are they capable? Motivated? Committed? Leaders must answer this question before they
t
decide where they want the business to go, and that sometimes means getting the wrong people off the bus.
f
3. What are the brutal facts? Leaders cannot make good decisions unless they have access to facts, both good and bad.
Confronting the negative, most troubling issues is essential because ignoring them represents a serious threat not only to 
a company’s success but also to its survival. The key is to confront the facts without losing faith.
4. What are we best at, and what do we have an unbounded passion for? By answering this question, leaders are defining their 
companies’ fundamental economic engine. Isaiah Berlin wrote, “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big 
thing.”* In other words, a fox is easily distracted, but a hedgehog, like an outstanding company, is focused, determined, and 
relentless. A company’s hedgehog combines its passion and its distinctive competence with what it can make money doing (its 
economic engine). What is the company’s hedgehog? 
What you can
be the best in
the world at
Hedgehog
Concept
What drives
your economic
engine
What you are deeply
passionate about
5. What is our company’s 20-Mile March, and are we hitting it? Collins refers to Roald Amundsen’s successful attempt in 
1911 to be the first person to reach the South Pole by committing to traveling 20 miles a day, no matter what the weather or 
other obstacles he and his team encountered. Every company has a specific performance goal it must hit year in and year out to 
be successful. Has the company identified that goal and committed to achieving it? How successful has the company been in 
achieving the goal? Measuring performance in the 20-Mile March means that leaders must develop a meaningful set of metrics 
and monitor them constantly.
6. Where do empirical data tell us that we should be placing our big bets? A company should invest major resources in a new 
initiative only if leaders already know that it is likely to succeed. That requires conducting low-cost, low-risk tests on a range of 
possible options (“shooting bullets”) to figure out what works before unleashing the full power of the organization’s resources on 
an initiative (“firing a cannonball”). The empirical evidence from the tests guides leaders’ decisions about where to aim the cannon.
(continued)

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
7. What are the core values and core purpose on which we want to build this enterprise over the next 100 years? The challenge 
is not only to build a company that can endure the long haul but also to build one that is worthy of enduring. Leaders must 
identify the core values and core purpose they would be willing have their companies built around 100 years in the future no 
matter what changes occur in the external environment.
8. What is our 15- to 25-year BHAG? A BHAG is “big, hairy audacious goal.” To build a great, enduring company, leaders must 
have a BHAG that is tangible, energizing, and highly focused and that people can understand immediately with little or no 
explanation. The BHAG should be linked to the company’s core values and purpose. In addition, achieving the BHAG should 
require a company to make a quantum leap in its capabilities and its aptitude.
9. What could kill our company, and how can we protect our flanks? Paranoia is productive when it helps a business survive the
inevitable bad surprises that come along and avoid the disasters they are capable of producing. The idea is for leaders not to be 
t
plagued by constant fear but to be sensitive to changing conditions in the environment and ask, “What if . . .?” Great leaders are 
always watching the horizon for the threat of storms—and opportunities. They also prepare for the inevitable stormy times by 
building up cash reserves.
10. What should we stop doing to increase our discipline and focus? Effective leaders are disciplined when it comes to pursuing 
business opportunities. They know that determining what their companies should not do is as important as determining what 
t
they should do. Although an “opportunity of a lifetime” may arise, excellent leaders know that pursuing it is meaningless (and
d
downright dangerous) unless it fits inside the three circles of their “hedgehog.”
11. How can we increase our return on luck? All companies are affected by both good luck and bad luck. What counts is what a 
company does with the luck it encounters—good and bad. How can the company glean the greatest benefit from good luck and
d
minimize the damage that a run of bad luck causes?
12. Are we becoming a Level 5 leadership team and cultivating a Level 5 management culture? Collins calls the highest level 
of leadership Level 5, which builds enduring greatness in a company through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and 
professional will. “The central dimension for Level 5 is a leader who is ambitious first and foremost for the cause, for the 
company, for the work, not for himself or herself; and has an absolutely terrifying iron will to make good on that ambition,”
says Collins. Are you and your management team providing Level 5 leadership?

TABLE 16.1 12 Questions That Every Leader Should Address (continued)
Leading an organization, whatever its size, is one of the biggest challenges any entrepreneur 
faces. Yet for an entrepreneur, leadership success is one of the key determinants of a company’s 
success. Research suggests that there is no single “best” style of leadership; the style a leader uses 
depends, in part, on the situation at hand. Some situations are best suited for a participative leader-
ship style, but in others, an authoritarian style actually may be best. Research by Daniel Goleman 
and others suggests that today’s workers tend to respond more to adaptive, humble leaders who 
are results oriented and who take the time to cultivate other leaders in the organization.14 The 
practice is known as servant leadership, a phrase coined by Robert Greenleaf in 1970. Servant 
leaders are servants first and leaders second, putting their employees and their employees’ needs
t
ahead of their own. They are concerned more about empowering others in the organization than 
about enhancing their own power bases. “Servant-leaders ask, ‘What do people need? How can
I help them to get it? What does my organization need to do? How can I help my organization to
do it?’” explains Kent Keith, CEO of the Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership. “Rather than
embarking on a quest for personal power, servant-leaders embark on a quest to identify and meet 
the needs of others.”15 At ENGEO, a geotechnical and hydrologic engineering consulting firm in
San Ramon, California, managers see themselves as servant leaders whose jobs are to “lead from 
the bottom” by supporting employees as they perform their daily work. That means managers
train and empower workers to make decisions that in many other companies only managers are 
authorized to make.16
servant leadership
a leadership style in which 
a leader takes on the role 
of servant first and leader 
second.

One business writer explains servant leadership this way:
Real leadership is grounded in a higher level of self-interest that’s tied to the interests of 
those who trust and follow their leader. It [creates] an atmosphere of confidence and light 
of clarity that flows from and surrounds the leader and that fills the room with the exhilara-
tion of possibility.17
To tap into that exhilaration of possibility, an entrepreneurial leader must perform many 
important tasks, including the following:
● Hire the right employees for the entrepreneurial team and constantly improve their skills.
● Create a culture for motivating and retaining employees.
● Plan for “passing the torch” to the next generation of leadership.
Building an Entrepreneurial Team:  
Hiring the Right Employees
As a company grows, the people an entrepreneur hires determine the heights to which the com-
pany can climb—or the depths to which it will plunge. Experienced managers understand that the 
quality of their workforce affects the company’s ability to thrive. Acquiring that human capital,
however, can be difficult. In a recent survey, North American human resource managers ranked
acquiring necessary talent as their top concern.18 The problem is particularly acute for small 
companies, which usually cannot afford to match the salaries and benefit packages their larger 
rivals offer employees. More than one-third of small business owners say their companies are 
somewhat or significantly understaffed.19 In addition, 11 percent of business owners report that 
the job searches they conduct never produced a suitable candidate, and 28 percent say the posi-
tions for which they were hiring remained vacant for up to three months.20
The decision to hire a new employee is an important one for every business, but its impact 
is magnified many times in a small company. One new employee represents a significant in-
vestment and a significant risk. Adding just one or two employees can significantly increase a
company’s ability to generate sales. However, in a small company, one bad hiring decision can 
poison the entire culture, reduce employee productivity, and disrupt any sense of teamwork. 
Unfortunately, hiring mistakes in business are all too common: 66 percent of companies in the 
United States report that they made a bad hire within the last year.21 The culprit in most cases?
The company’s selection and hiring process.
Hiring mistakes are incredibly expensive, and no company, especially small ones, can afford 
too many of them. The higher the position is in an organization and the longer the tenure of the
person who holds that position, the higher the cost associated with replacing a “bad hire.” Em-
ployers report that their hiring mistakes result in lower productivity (36 percent), negative impact 
on employee morale (32 percent), time lost and cost incurred in recruiting and training another 
worker (31 percent), and diminished customer satisfaction (18 percent).22 Even the best training 
program cannot overcome a flawed hiring decision. One study reported in the Harvard Business
Review concludes that 80 percent of employee turnover is caused by bad hiring decisions.23 The 
most common causes of a company’s poor hiring decisions include the following:
● Managers who rely on candidates’ descriptions of themselves rather than requiring candi-
dates to demonstrate their abilities.
● Managers who fail to follow a consistent, evidence-based selection process. Forty-seven
percent of managers admit they make hiring decisions in 30 minutes or less, and 44 percent 
of managers say they rely on their intuition to make hiring decisions.
● Managers who fail to provide candidates with sufficient information about what the jobs 
for which they are hiring actually entail, which results in a job-skill mismatch.24
● Managers who succumb to pressure to fill a job quickly.
● Managers who fail to check candidates’ references.25

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
As crucial as finding good employees is to a small company’s future, it is no easy task be-
cause entrepreneurs face a labor shortage, particularly among knowledge-based workers. The
severity of this shortage will become more acute as baby boomers retire in increasing numbers 
and the growth rate of the U.S. labor force slows (see Figure 16.1). According to the National 
Commission for Employment Policy, the impact of these demographic changes will be a “skilled 
worker gap” (in which the demand for skilled workers outstrips the supply) of 14 million in 
2020.26 The result is that small businesses already find themselves pursuing the best talent not 
just across the United States but across the globe. A recent study by ManpowerGroup reports that 
35 percent of companies around the world have difficulty filling jobs because of a lack of avail-
able talent. The United States is above the global average with 39 percent of companies having 
difficulty filling jobs because of a lack of talent.27
Unfilled jobs are expensive; the average company loses more than $14,000 for every job that 
is vacant for at least three months. Employers report that their extended job vacancies result in 
a negative impact on employee morale (41 percent), work that does not get done (40 percent),
delays in delivery times (34 percent), diminished customer service (30 percent), lower quality 
of work because remaining employees are overworked (30 percent), and diminished employee 
motivation (29 percent).28
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Kevin Madden: Group One Safety and Security Kevin 
Madden, president of Group One Safety and Security, a 16-employee company in Stuart,
Florida, that installs security and video surveillance systems in homes and commercial properties, 
has two job openings for technicians that have gone unfilled for 18 months. Although hourly pay 
rates for the jobs range from $16 to $30, depending on qualifications and experience, the jobs
remain unfilled. Madden frequently declines new projects, costing his Group One sales, because 
he is not willing to jeopardize his company’s reputation for providing excellent customer service
due to a lack of technical support staff.29 ■
High employee turnover rates cost companies as well. The voluntary turnover rate for em-
ployees is 16.6 percent, which means that the average employee’s tenure at a company is about 
six years. The average cost that a company incurs when an employee leaves is 20 percent of the 
employee’s annual salary (for employees who earn less than $50,000 annually) and 213 percent 
of the annual salary for an executive who leaves.30 A company with 25 employees can expect to 
lose, on average, about four employees per year. If those employees earn an average of $40,000,
the cost to the company is $32,000 per year ($40,000 × 20% = $8,000 per employee. 4 employ-
ees × $8,000 = $32,000). To reduce their employee turnover rates, companies can employ the
following strategies:
● Provide rewarding and challenging work.
● Pay employees fairly.
● Provide training opportunities and mentoring relationships.

● Offer flexible work schedules.
● Provide simple (and inexpensive) rewards such as thank-you notes for extra effort or “good 
job” notes for jobs well done.
● Conduct exit interviews when employees leave to determine areas that require 
improvement.
A recent study by IBM reports that 71 percent of CEOs across the globe say the most impor-
tant factor in their companies’ ability to provide sustained economic value to their customers is 
the quality of their employees.31 Smart business owners recognize that the companies that have 
the most talented, best-trained, and most motivated workforces will be the winners.
As a result of the intense competition for quality workers among businesses, employers often
feel pressured to hire someone, even if that person is not a good fit for the job. A study by Devel-
opment Dimensions International reports that 34 percent of hiring managers admit to making bad 
hiring decisions because they were under pressure to fill a job.32 The result is the almost always
an expensive hiring mistake for the company. Smart entrepreneurs maintain their hiring standards 
even when the pressure is on to fill a position.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Dane Atkinson: SumAll Dane Atkinson, cofounder of 
SumAll, a business analytics company in New York City, believes that hiring “fast” increases
the odds of hiring mistakes. At SumAll, every new employee goes through a 45-day probationary 
period, during which time he or she is assigned to a mentor and receives regular reviews from a 
dedicated selection committee. At the end of the probationary period, selection committee mem-
bers vote on whether to hire the candidate permanently. If the candidate passes that vote, the re-
mainder of the employees in the company vote, and one “no” vote sends the candidate packing. 
About 70 percent of candidates make it through the process and are hired permanently. The pro-
cess works; in the two years since it has been in place, only one employee has left the company.33 ■
How to Hire Winners
Even though the importance of hiring decisions is magnified in small companies, small busi-
nesses are most likely to make hiring mistakes because they lack the human resources experts
and the disciplined hiring procedures that large companies have. In many small businesses, the
hiring process is informal, and the results often are unpredictable. In the early days of a company, 
entrepreneurs rarely take the time to create job descriptions and specifications; instead, they usu-
ally hire people because they know or trust them rather than for their job or interpersonal skills. 
As the company grows, business owners hire people to fit in around these existing employees,
often creating a very unusual, inefficient organization structure built around jobs that are poorly
planned and designed.
The following guidelines can help entrepreneurs to become employers of choice and to hire 
winners as they build their team of employees.
COMMIT TO HIRING THE BEST TALENT Smart entrepreneurs follow the old adage, “A players 
hire A players; B players hire C players.” They are not threatened by hiring people who may be 
smarter and more talented than they are. In fact, they recognize that doing so is the best way to 
build a quality team. What skill sets do CEOs say are essential to employees’ success? According 
to the IBM study of global CEOs, the most important skills are the ability to collaborate with 
others (75 percent), the ability to communicate effectively (67 percent), creativity (61 percent), 
flexibility (61 percent), and analytical and quantitative skills (50 percent).34
ELEVATE RECRUITING TO A STRATEGIC POSITION IN THE COMPANY The recruiting process is the 
starting point for building quality into a company. Chris McCann, cofounder of NextDigest, a 
company that publishes newsletters for technology entrepreneurs, says that after finding money 
the most difficult challenge start-ups face is finding talent.35 Assembling a quality workforce 
begins with a sound recruiting effort. By investing time and money in the crucial planning phase 
of the staffing process, entrepreneurs can generate spectacular savings down the road by hiring 
the best talent. Recruiting is so important that many entrepreneurs are actively involved in the 
process themselves. Visionary entrepreneurs never stop recruiting because top-quality talent is 
r
hard to find and is extremely valuable. Tom Bonney, founder of CMF Associates, a fast-growing 

634
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
financial consulting firm in Philadelphia, knows that finding superior talent is essential to the 
success of his service business and says he never stop recruiting.36 Unfortunately, Bonney is 
in the minority; only 38 percent of hiring managers say they constantly recruit. Their principal 
barrier: lack of time.37
Attracting a pool of qualified job candidates requires not only constant attention but also 
creativity, especially among smaller companies that often find it difficult to match the more gen-
erous offers large companies make. With a sound recruiting strategy and a willingness to look in 
new places, however, smaller companies can hire and retain high-caliber employees. The follow-
ing techniques will help:
Look inside the company first. One of the best sources for top prospects is inside the 
company itself. A promotion-from-within policy serves as an incentive for existing workers 
to upgrade their skills and to produce results. In addition, an entrepreneur already knows 
the employee’s work habits, and the employee already understands the company’s culture. 
Unfortunately, companies fill only one-third of their job vacancies from within.38
Look for employees with whom your customers can identify. For an entrepreneur whose 
company sells women’s shoes, hiring young women straight out of college to manage the 
company’s social media presence makes sense; however, hiring young women for sales
positions in a company that sells makeup to middle-age women does not. At the Vermont 
Country Store, a business in Rockingham, Vermont, now in its fifth generation of family 
ownership, half of the employees are older than 50, which benefits the company because 
the average customer is in his or her 60s.39
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Greg Selkoe: Karmaloop Greg Selkoe, founder and 
CEO of Karmaloop, a Boston-based e-commerce company that operates a growing 
hipster media empire representing more than 500 brands, looks for employees who resemble
the company’s target customers, members of verge culture. “What makes us successful is that 
our employees reflect the street culture that we market to,” says Selkoe. “Some are DJs or 
musicians or artists. They’re young; the median age here is 26, and from almost every race, 
religion, and ethnicity. Basically, they are the market we sell to.”40 ■
Encourage employee referrals. To cope with the shortage of available talent, many com-
panies are offering their employees (and others) bonuses for referring candidates who 
come to work and prove to be valuable employees. Employees serve as reliable screens 
because they do not want to jeopardize their reputations with their employer. Employee 
referrals have proved to be an excellent source of quality employees. Although employee 
referrals are the source of only 6.9 percent of applicants, they account for 39.9 percent of 
those hired. Employees hired through employee referrals also have higher retention rates 
than those hired by job Web sites and job boards.41 The Nerdery, a Web design firm in
Bloomington, Minnesota, finds about 25 percent of its new hires through referrals from 
existing employees.42 To encourage employee referrals, many companies offer incentives 
for successful hires. Rewards companies offer to employees for successful referrals range 
from cash and iPads to big-screen televisions and exotic vacations. At CarGurus, a Web site 
that helps car buyers navigate the often intimidating process of researching and purchasing 
a car, founder and serial entrepreneur Langley Steinert offers employees cash bonuses for 
recommending quality job candidates.43
Make employment advertisements stand out. Getting employment ads noticed in 
traditional media is becoming more difficult because they get lost in the swarm of ads 
from other companies.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Amy Rees Anderson: MediConnect Global When 
Amy Rees Anderson was CEO of MediConnect Global, a fast-growing medical records 
retrieval and electronic document management company, she created several offbeat videos
that featured brief, home-made clips of employees demonstrating their silly and unusual 
talents (for example, one employee balanced a toilet plunger on one finger and then suc-
tioned it to his stomach) to make her company’s recruiting ad stand out and to communicate 
the sense of fun in the company’s culture. The videos opened with a graphic that said,

635
“Featuring the Elite Talent of MediConnect Global” before showing the employees’ “talents” 
and closing with a graphic that said, “What’s your elite talent? Apply now.” The low-cost ads
were successful, not only producing many new hires that Anderson says the company would 
have missed otherwise but also improving employee morale.44 ■
Use multiple channels to recruit talent. Although newspaper ads still top employers’ list 
of job postings, many businesses are successfully attracting candidates through other me-
dia, particularly the Internet. The goal is to spread wide a company’s recruiting net. Posting 
job listings on the company’s Web page, on its social media accounts, on career-oriented 
Web sites such as Monster, CareerBuilder, and others not only expands a small company’s
reach far beyond ads in a local newspaper but also is very inexpensive. A recent survey by 
Jobvite reports that 98 percent of recruiters use LinkedIn to recruit employees, 42 percent 
use Facebook, and 33 percent use Twitter. In addition, 73 percent of the companies used 
these social media tools to make successful hires, and 42 percent say adding social media 
as a recruiting tool increased the quality of the applicant pool.45 Employers also are con-
necting with potential employees (not all of whom are actively seeking new jobs) through 
their employees’ social media sites and network of contacts. A social media recruiting 
strategy works well for technology companies such as Red Hat Inc. (the company that dis-
tributes the Linux operating system), which finds 50 percent of its new hires through social 
networks.46 Mobile apps and technology such as smart phones provide another mechanism 
for reaching job candidates. One recent survey reports that 72 percent of job seekers want 
to receive career opportunity information on their smart phones (and 45 percent of job
seekers have applied for a job using their smart phones).47
Recruit on campus. For many employers, college and university campuses remain an 
excellent source of workers, especially for entry-level positions. In a recent survey, 39 per-
cent of college graduates say a small or medium-size business would be the ideal place to 
work (compared to 27 percent who believe a large corporation would be the ideal place to 
work).48 After screening résumés, a recruiter can interview a dozen or more high-potential
students in just one day by conducting on-campus interviews. Entrepreneurs must ensure 
that the recruiters they send to campuses are professional, polished, and prepared to repre-
sent their companies well because 42 percent of students say their impression of a recruiter 
is the primary determinant of their perception of the company.49
Forge relationships with schools and other sources of workers. Internships and co-op 
programs can be excellent sources of future employees. As colleges and universities offer 
students more internship and co-op opportunities, small businesses can benefit from host-
ing one or more students for a semester or for a summer. Internships and co-op programs 
offer companies low-risk opportunities to “test-drive” potential employees, observe stu-
dents’ work habits, and sell top performers on permanent positions on graduation. A recent 
study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers reports that employers offer 
full-time jobs to 56.5 percent of their interns. In addition, 72.9 percent of interns who are 
hired for full-time positions are still working for the same companies five years later.50
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Burnstein von Seelen Burnstein von Seelen, a preci-
sion castings company located in Abbeville, South Carolina, that specializes in produc-
ing cast products from copper-based materials, faced a shortage of skilled machine tool
operators, and three-fourths of its machinists were at or near retirement age. Managers 
worked with the Metal Trades Department at a local technical college, Piedmont Technical 
College, to create a co-op apprenticeship program in which students could attend classes for 
a semester and work for a semester. Kenny Price, the first student to participate in the pro-
gram, started as an apprentice with Burnstein von Seelen and now has a full-time job as a
machine tool operator. The co-op apprenticeship program has been so successful that the 
company is expanding it.51 ■
Recruit “retired” workers. By 2020, 20.4 percent of workers in the United States will 
reach retirement age.52 Many of these baby boomers plan to continue working after reach-
ing retirement age to maintain their lifestyles, however. The Bureau of Labor Statistics 
estimates that 13.2 million people over the age of 65 will be in the workforce in 2022,

636
SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
an increase from 7.3 million today, and small businesses should be ready to hire them.53
With a lifetime of work experience, time on their hands, and a strong work ethic, “retired” 
workers can be the ideal solution to many entrepreneurs’ labor problems and can be a valu-
able asset to small firms.
Consider using offbeat recruiting techniques. To attract the workers they need to sup-
port their growing businesses, some entrepreneurs have resorted to creative recruiting 
techniques. As part of its recruiting efforts, Range Resources Corporation, a natural gas 
company, sponsors a unique float in the local Fourth of July parade, invites prospective 
employees to mingle with current employees at cookouts, and sends employee representa-
tives prepared to talk about working at the company to more than 1,000 community events 
each year.54 Other ideas include the following:
● Sending young recruiters to mingle with college students on spring break. Deloitte, 
an accounting and consulting firm, takes dozens of college students to various loca-
tions for Spring Break. Rather than party on the beach, however, the students work 
alongside Deloitte employees in a program called Maximum Impact, focusing on com-
munity projects ranging from sprucing up community parks and repairing homes for 
the elderly to preparing taxes and assisting in soup kitchens. Sara Ferguson, who took 
part in a Maximum Impact trip to Galveston, Texas, while she was a college student, 
now works for Deloitte. Ferguson says the experience gave her unique insight into the 
company’s culture and assured her that Deloitte was the type of company for which she 
wanted to work.55
● Using social networks, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and company blogs to 
reach potential employees, especially young ones.
● Sponsoring a “job-shadowing” program that gives students and other prospects the
opportunity to observe firsthand the nature of the work and the work environment.
● Inviting prospective employees to a company tailgating party at a sports event.
● Inviting potential candidates to participate in a company-sponsored event. Corey Reese, 
cofounder of Ness Computing, a company that makes practical apps for the iPhone, 
sponsors “hackathon” events on college campuses that attract the technologically savvy
computer software engineers he must hire for the fast-growing company.56
● Posting “what it’s like to work here” videos created by current employees on the 
company’s Facebook page, YouTube, and other video sites.
● Inviting potential candidates to meet and mingle with a company’s workforce at infor-
mal, fun events. Ness Computing regularly invites potential employees to company-
sponsored barbecues and picnics.
● Keeping a file of all of the workers mentioned in the “People on the Move” column in 
the business section of the local newspaper and then contacting them a year later to see 
whether they are happy in their jobs.57
Offer what workers want. Adequate compensation and benefits are important consid-
erations for job candidates, but other, less tangible factors also weigh heavily in a pros-
pect’s decision to accept a job. To recruit effectively, entrepreneurs must consider what 
a McKinsey and Company study calls the “employee value proposition,” the factors that 
would make the ideal employee want to work for their businesses. Flexible work schedules 
and telecommuting that allow employees to balance the demands of work and family life 
attract quality workers to small companies. Human resource managers say the most impor-
tant factor in a company’s ability to attract and retain the best workers, especially young 
ones, is a flexible work schedule. (The second most important factor is a culture character-
ized by trust, open communication, and fairness.)58 Employees agree. In a recent survey, 
83 percent of workers say they would be more loyal to their companies if they had flexible 
work schedules.59
Many of the companies listed on Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” offer 
low-cost but valuable (from their employees’ perspectives) benefits, such as take-home 
meals, personal concierge services that coordinate everything from dry cleaning to auto 
maintenance for employees, exercise facilities, and discounts on the merchandise they sell.60

ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: April Kumzelman: Fat Wallet Fat Wallet, an online dis-
count retailer, provides employees with a valuable, low-cost benefit—the flexibility they 
need to achieve work–life balance. The company’s “no-miss” policy tells employees not to miss 
important family or school events because of work. “It doesn’t cost us any money, and people re-
ally appreciate it,” says human resources director April Kunzelman. “Flexibility pays huge benefits 
for a small company like ours.”61 ■

Create Practical Job Descriptions and Job Specifications
Business owners must recognize that what they do before they interview candidates for a posi-
tion determines to a great extent how successful they will be at hiring winners. The first step is 
to perform a job analysis, the process by which a firm determines the duties and nature of the 
jobs to be filled and the skills and experience required of the people who are to fill them. With-
out a proper job analysis, a hiring decision is, at best, a coin toss. The first step in conducting a 
job analysis is to develop a job description, a written statement of the duties, responsibilities, 
reporting relationships, working conditions, and methods and techniques as well as materials and
equipment used in a job. A results-oriented job description explains what a job entails and the 
duties the person filling it is expected to perform. A detailed job description includes a job title, 
job summary, primary responsibilities and duties, nature of supervision, the job’s relationship to 
others in the company, working conditions, the job’s location, definitions of job-specific terms, 
and a description of the company and its culture.
Preparing job descriptions is a task that most small business owners overlook; however, this 
may be one of the most important parts of the hiring process because it creates a blueprint for the job.
Without this blueprint, managers tend to hire the person with experience whom they like the best.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Sherri Comstock: The Cheshire Cat and The Spotted 
Crocodile Sherri Comstock, owner of The Cheshire Cat and The Spotted Crocodile, two
jewelry and gift boutiques in Grayslake, Illinois, admits to failing to write meaningful job descrip-
tions. “One of the biggest mistakes we’ve made is not defining the job as well as we should,” she 
says. “If the position is not well-defined before you hire the person to fill it, a bad fit is all but 
inevitable.”62 ■

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
One week after hiring a shipping manager for her online personal-
ized gifts business, The Younique Boutique, Brina Bujkovsky knew 
something was wrong. Other employees saw the new hire slip-
ping in and out of the building with a backpack. One day at lunch,
he left to “make a personal call” but did not return for several 
hours. When he finally showed up, he was extremely intoxicated. 
Bujkovsky fired him immediately.
Hiring mistakes like the one Bujkovsky made are quite com-
mon and can be expensive, especially for small companies. Spot-
ting problem employees before they are hired, however, is not
always easy because bad employees often are adept at hiding
their problems until well after they are hired. What steps can en-
trepreneurs take to avoid making critical hiring mistakes?
•
Know what you want. Before hiring anyone, an entrepre-
neur should create a job description and a job specification. 
These important documents spell out the duties and respon-
sibilities of the job and define the skills, traits, and experi-
ence of the ideal candidate.
•
Don’t be in a hurry. Rushing through the hiring process 
almost always guarantees a hiring mistake. Hiring a new 
employee is a long-term commitment; make sure you 
devote sufficient time to making the right decision.
•
Involve others in the selection process. Involving others 
in the selection process lowers the probability that “warning 
signs” about a candidate will go unnoticed. After her hir-
ing mistake, Bujkovsky changed the selection process in her
company to include her entire team in the interview process.
•
Ask the right questions and listen carefully to candi-
dates’ answers. Smart entrepreneurs always prepare for
interviews and have a set of prepared questions that are
designed to probe each candidate’s experience, personality,
background, and work ethic. They also listen carefully (even 
for what candidates don’t say) and watch their body lan-
guage during the interview.
•
“Test drive” candidates whenever possible. Internships 
and apprenticeships allow employers to observe candidates 
to determine whether they are likely to make good full-time 
employees. When internships or apprenticeships are not 
practical, some companies use interviews that put candi-
dates into situations they are likely to encounter on the job 
to see how they handle them.
•
Check references—always. Checking candidates’ refer-
ences takes time, but the payoff can be huge. Some compa-
nies check “one-off” references, those people with whom a 
candidate worked but are not listed as references on the ap-
plication. Asking listed references for other potential refer-
ences and searching social media sites such as LinkedIn and 
Facebook can produce these valuable unofficial references.
•
Look for candidates’ profiles on social media 
platforms. Social media can be useful not only for find-
ing candidates but also for learning more about them. 
Although it is not a good idea to ask for candidates’ social 
media passwords (it actually is illegal in six states), reviewing 
their social media profiles can be quite revealing. A recent 
survey by Jobvite reports that 94 percent of recruiters use 
or plan to use social media to hire employees. In another 
study, 43 percent of hiring managers say they have found 
information on social media that caused them not to hire 
a candidate. Conversely, 20 percent of hiring managers say 
they found information on social media that led them to 
hire a candidate.

You Be the Consultant
Avoid These Hiring Mistakes
Useful sources of information for writing job descriptions include the manager’s knowl-
edge of the job, the worker(s) currently holding the job, and the Dictionary of Occupational 
Titles, which is available online. This dictionary, published by the U.S. Department of Labor, 
lists more than 20,000 job titles and descriptions and serves as a useful tool for getting a small 
business owner started when writing job descriptions. Internet searches also are a valuable 
tool for finding resources for writing job descriptions. There, entrepreneurs can find templates 
and descriptions they can easily modify to fit their companies’ needs. Table 16.3 provides an 
example of the description drawn from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles for an unusual 
job, a worm picker.

job specification
a written statement of 
the qualifications and 
characteristics needed for 
a job stated in terms such 
as education, skills, and 
experience.
TABLE 16.3 A Sample Job Description from the Dictionary 
of Occupational Titles
Worm Picker—gathers worms to be used as fish bait; walks about grassy areas, such as gardens, parks,
r
and golf courses and picks up earthworms (commonly called dew worms and nightcrawlers). Sprinkles 
chlorinated water on lawn to cause worms to come to the surface and locates worms by use of lantern or 
flashlight. Counts worms, sorts them, and packs them into containers for shipment. (# 413.687-014)
The second objective of a job analysis is to create a job specification, a written statement 
of the qualifications and characteristics needed for a job stated in terms such as education, skills,
and experience. A job specification shows the small business manager the kind of person to re-
cruit and establishes the standards an applicant must meet to be hired. In essence, it is a written 
“success profile” of the ideal employee. Does the person have to be a good listener, empathetic, 
well organized, decisive, and a “self-starter”? Should he or she have experience in Python pro-
gramming? One of the best ways to develop this success profile is to study the top performers
currently working for the company and to identify the characteristics that make them successful. 
Before hiring new sales representatives, sales managers at Blackboard, Inc., a Washington, D.C.,
company that sells software for the educational market, study their top sales producers to identify 
the characteristics they demonstrate in four areas—skills, experience, knowledge, and personal-
ity traits. Table 16.4 provides an example that links the tasks for a sales representative’s job 
(drawn from the job description) to the traits or characteristics an entrepreneur identified as nec-
essary to succeed in that job. These traits become the foundation for writing the job specification.
Plan an Effective Interview
Once an entrepreneur knows what to look for in a job candidate, he or she can develop a plan for 
conducting an informative job interview. Research shows that planned interviews produce much 
more reliable hiring results than unstructured interviews in which interviewers “freewheel” the 
questions they ask candidates. Unstructured interviews produce no better results than flipping a 
coin to decide whether to hire a candidate, but structured interviews produce highly valid hiring 
results.63 Too often, business owners go into an interview unprepared, and as a result, they fail to 
get the information they need to judge the candidate’s qualifications, qualities, and suitability for 
the job. A common symptom of failing to prepare for an interview is that the interviewer rather 
than the candidate does most of the talking.
Conducting an effective interview requires an entrepreneur to know what he or she wants
to get out of the interview in the first place and to develop a series of questions to extract that 
information. The following guidelines will help entrepreneurs develop interview questions that 
will give them meaningful insight into an applicant’s qualifications, personality, and character:
Involve others in the interview process. Solo interviews are prone to errors. A better pro-
cess is to involve other employees, particularly employees with whom the prospect would 
be working, in the interview process either individually or as part of a panel.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Richard Sheridan: Menlo Innovations At Menlo
Innovations, a successful custom software company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, collabora-
tion among workers is paramount because employees typically work together on projects in 
pairs all day. Menlo Innovations’s hiring process reflects its emphasis on collaboration in what
cofounder Richard Sheridan calls “extreme interviewing.” Candidates team up in pairs to 
tackle 20-minute exercises that are typical of the projects they would work on at Menlo In-
novations while employees and managers observe them. To drive home the company’s focus 
on teamwork, each team of candidates shares a single pencil. Candidates complete three
exercises so that employees can observe them. After an extreme interviewing session, em-
ployees collectively decide which candidates to invite back. Those selected spend a day work-
ing for pay with two employees on a project. Those who pass that test come back for a
three-week trial employment period. Only after completing the trial successfully do they be-
come Menlo Innovations employees.64 ■
Develop a series of core questions and ask them of every candidate. To give the screen-
ing process more consistency, smart business owners rely on a set of relevant ques-
tions they ask in every interview. Of course, they also customize each interview using 
impromptu questions based on an individual candidate’s responses. “The most effective 
way to hire fantastic, loyal employees who will fit into your company culture and help you 
meet your goals is to hire them for their inherent abilities (which can’t be taught), such as 
personality, learning style, and core values,” says Mike Michalowicz, a successful serial 
entrepreneur who started his first business at age 24. “You do this by identifying behavior 
patterns during the interview process. If you ask questions designed to identify the patterns,
you can predict how prospective employees will behave.”65
Ask open-ended questions (including on-the-job “scenarios”) rather than questions 
calling for “yes or no” answers. These types of questions are most effective because they 
encourage candidates to talk about their work experience in a way that will disclose the 
presence or the absence of the traits and characteristics the business owner is seeking. Peter 
Bregman, CEO of Bregman Partners, a company that helps businesses implement change, 
says one of the most revealing questions that an interviewer can ask candidates is, “What 
do you do in your spare time?” The answer to this question offers unique insight that helps 
interviewers differentiate between those who are merely competent and those who are 
stars. Bregman points to the example of Captain C. B. “Sully” Sullenberger, the pilot who 
safely landed a disabled jet with 155 passengers on the Hudson River using skills that he 
learned from his hobby: flying gliders.66
Create hypothetical situations that candidates would be likely to encounter on the 
job and ask (or better yet watch) how they would handle them. Building the interview
around these kinds of questions gives the owner a preview of the candidate’s actual work 
habits and attitudes. Some companies take this idea a step further and put candidates into 
a simulated work environment to see how they prioritize activities and handle mail, e-mail, 
and a host of “real-world” problems they are likely to encounter on the job, ranging from 
complaining customers to problematic employees. Known as situational interviews, their 
goal is to give interviewers keener insight into how candidates would perform in the work 
environment.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Andy Dunn: Bonobos Andy Dunn, cofounder and 
CEO of clothing company Bonobos, says that situational interviews are the most im-
portant screening tool his company uses. The company asks candidates to perform the jobs 
for which they are interviewing. For instance, a person who applies for a job as a Customer
Service Ninja has the chance to respond to e-mail questions and complaints from actual cus-
tomers. At the executive level, Bonobos invites candidates to offer advice on a big decision
the company faces and has even allowed them to run meetings to develop solutions to spe-
cific problems.67 ■
Probe for specific examples in the candidate’s past work experience that demon-
strate the necessary traits and characteristics. A common mistake interviewers make 
is failing to get candidates to provide the detail they need to make an informed decision.

Explorer Ernest Shackleton reportedly placed this advertisement
in a British newspaper to recruit the crew for his 1914 expedition
with the goal of “crossing the South Polar continent from sea to 
sea,” a distance of 1,800 miles in the face of some of the most 
grueling and dangerous conditions possible. Nearly 5,000 men
applied, from which Shackleton selected 28 of the most capable 
men, carefully matching their skills and abilities to the challenges 
that the journey would present. On August 1, 1914, Shackleton
and his crew left London on their ship, the Endurance, to docu-
ment the largely unexplored Antarctic. On October 27, 1915, after 
watching the Endurance splinter after being stuck in pack ice for 
10 months, Shackleton and his crew began a harrowing journey 
of survival that would not end until August 20, 1916, 22 months 
after their expedition began. Even though Shackleton’s ad stated
“safe return doubtful,” Shackleton and his entire crew returned 
safely to London after an amazing adventure.
Like Shackleton, smart entrepreneurs know that writing job 
descriptions that make jobs sound more interesting, glamorous,
and exciting than they really are not only is misleading but also 
creates problems for their businesses. To avoid high turnover rates, 
low morale, and abysmal productivity rates among their employ-
ees, entrepreneurs must paint realistic pictures of jobs when they
create job descriptions. Recruiters at Lindblad Expeditions, a com-
pany that takes guests on adventure cruises to exciting destina-
tions around the globe, makes sure that job applicants get an
unvarnished picture of what their jobs would entail—warts and
all. Prospective employees receive a DVD that shows crew mem-
bers performing their daily tasks—from serving meals to guests 
and seeing wildlife on the Galapagos Islands to washing windows 
and swabbing toilets. “The things you see and the places that you 
go are amazing, but you’re still doing this incredibly hard work,”
says one employee. “You’re going to put in 10- to 12-hour days,” 
adds another. The video discourages most applicants, but those 
who do apply tend to be just the kind of young people Lindblad 
is looking for to take on a six-month assignment of taking care of 
guests’ safety and comfort. “If they get on board and say, ‘This 
is not what I expected,’ then shame on us,” says Kris Thompson, 
vice president of human resources.
Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, the online shoe retailer whose 
10 core values include “deliver WOW through service” and “cre-
ate fun and a little weirdness,” relies on an unusual policy to make 
sure his company hires only those employees who are most com-
mitted to fulfilling the company’s mission. After the first week of 
the company’s four-week training program, during which employ-
ees earn a full salary, Zappos presents them with “The Offer”: Stay 
with the company or take a $3,000 payout to leave, no strings at-
tached. Only about 10 percent of new employees take the money 
and leave. Hsieh says that those who remain are more likely to
believe in Zappos’s values and to commit themselves to uphold-
ing the company’s commitment to customer service. Every year, 
Zappos publishes the Zappos Culture Book, in which employees 
have the opportunity to write anything they want about Zappos’s 
core values and its culture, what the values and culture mean to 
them, and what they do to uphold them. In the foreword of a
recent edition of the Zappos Culture Book, Hsieh wrote, “For us 
to succeed as a service company, we need to create, maintain, and
grow a culture where employees want to play a part in providing 
great service. . . . As we grow as a company and hire new people, 
we need to make sure that they understand and become a part 
of our culture.”
1. Why is it important for entrepreneurs to create honest job 
descriptions to potential employees? What are the implica-
tions for entrepreneurs who fail to do so?
2. Is it ethical for small companies to present to potential em-
ployees only the “fun” aspects of a job and to gloss over its 
less appealing components?
3. Lindblad Expeditions and Zappos sometimes receive criti-
cism for being too extreme in the honesty of their recruiting 
approaches. Do you agree? Explain.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Experienced interviewers use the phrase “Tell me more” to harvest meaningful information 
about candidates.
Ask candidates to describe a recent success and a recent failure and how they dealt 
with them. Smart entrepreneurs look for candidates who describe their successes and their 
failures with equal enthusiasm because they know that peak performers put as much into their 
failures as they do their successes and usually learn something valuable from their failures.
Arrange a “noninterview” setting that allows several employees to observe the candi-
date in an informal setting. Giving candidates a plant tour, setting up a coffee break, or 
taking them to lunch gives more people a chance to judge a candidate’s interpersonal skills 
and personality outside the formal interview process. These informal settings can be very 
revealing.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Scott Lerner: Solixr Scott Lerner, founder of Solixr, 
an all-natural energy drink company, says that he learns a great deal about job candi-
dates in noninterview settings and often invites candidates to several lunches or to accom-
pany him on in-store demonstrations. These informal settings give Lerner better insight into 
candidates’ qualifications and personalities and how well they will fit into his company’s
culture.68 ■
Table 16.5 shows an example of some interview questions one business owner uses to un-
cover the traits and characteristics he seeks in a top-performing sales representative.
Conduct the Interview
An effective interview contains three phases: breaking the ice, asking questions, and selling the 
candidate on the company.
BREAKING THE ICE In the opening phase of the interview, the manager’s primary job is to diffuse
the tension that exists because of the nervousness of both parties. Many skilled interviewers use
the job description to explain the nature of the job and the company’s culture to the applicant. 
Then they use “icebreakers,” questions about a hobby or special interest, to get the candidate to 
relax and begin talking.
ASKING QUESTIONS During the second phase of the interview, the employer asks the questions
from the question bank to determine the applicant’s suitability for the job. The interviewer’s 
primary job at this point is to listen. Effective interviewers spend about 25 percent of the interview 
talking and about 75 percent listening. They also take notes during the interview to help them 
ask follow-up questions based on a candidate’s comments and to evaluate a candidate after the 
interview is over. Experienced interviewers also pay close attention to a candidate’s nonverbal 
clues, or body language, during the interview. They know candidates may be able to say exactly 
what they want with their words but their body language does not lie!

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
643
Some of the most valuable interview questions are designed to gain insight into a candidate’s
creativity and capacity for abstract thinking. Known as puzzle interviews, their goal is to de-
termine how candidates think by asking them offbeat questions, such as “You are shrunk to the 
height of a nickel and thrown into a blender. Your mass is reduced so that your density is the same 
as usual. The blades start moving in 60 seconds. What do you do?” (a classic interview question at 
Google).69 “How many cows are in Canada?” is another favorite Google interview question. Other 
companies use questions such as “A penguin walks through that door wearing a sombrero. What 
does he say, and why is he here? (asked at Clark Construction Group),” “If we came to your house 
for dinner, what would you prepare for us?” (a question asked by interviewers at Trader Joe’s), 
“How would you design Bill Gates’s bathroom?” (a favorite at Microsoft), or “What is the angle
of the two hands on a clock when the time is 11:50? (asked at Bank of America).”70 The logic and 
creativity that candidates use to derive an answer to these questions is much more important than 
the answer itself.
Entrepreneurs must be careful to avoid asking candidates illegal questions. At one time,
interviewers could ask wide-ranging questions covering just about every area of an applicant’s 
background. Today, interviewing is a veritable minefield of legal liabilities waiting to explode in 
the unsuspecting interviewer’s face. Although the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 
the government agency responsible for enforcing employment laws, does not outlaw specific 
questions, it does recognize that some questions can result in employment discrimination. If a
candidate files charges of employment discrimination against a company, the burden of proof 
shifts to the employer to prove that all pre-employment questions are job related and nondis-
criminatory. In addition, many states have passed laws that forbid the use of certain questions or 
screening tools in interviews. To avoid trouble, business owners should keep in mind why they
are asking a particular question. The goal is to identify individuals who are qualified to do the job 
well. By steering clear of questions about subjects that are peripheral to the job itself, employers 
are less likely to ask questions that will land them in court. Wise business owners ask their at-
torneys to review their bank of questions before using them in an interview. Table 16.6 provides 
a quiz for you to test your knowledge of the legality of certain interview questions.
SELLING THE CANDIDATE ON THE COMPANY In the final phase of the interview, the employer 
tries to sell desirable candidates on the company. This phase begins by allowing the candidate
to ask questions about the company, the job, or other issues. Experienced interviewers note the
nature of these questions and the insights they give into the candidate’s personality. This part 
of the interview offers the employer a prime opportunity to explain to the candidate why the 
company is an attractive place to work. Remember that the best candidates will have other offers,
and it’s up to you to make sure they leave the interview wanting to work for your company. 
Pointing out the benefits of working for a small company, such as a flexible work schedule, 
regular feedback, the opportunity to contribute directly to a meaningful mission, and the chance 
for growth and advancement, can influence a candidate’s decision. Finally, before closing the 
interview, the employer should thank the candidate and tell him or her what happens next (e.g., 
“We’ll be contacting you about our decision within two weeks.”).
Contact References and Conduct a Background Check
Entrepreneurs should take the time to conduct background checks and contact candidates’ refer-
ences. Background checks are inexpensive to perform but can save companies many thousands 
of dollars by identifying “red flags” in candidates’ backgrounds, helping them avoid making 
expensive hiring mistakes. By performing a basic background check, employers can steer clear 
of candidates with criminal or other high-risk backgrounds. Although some states ban the prac-
tice, conducting credit checks on job candidates (which legally require the candidates’ written 
permission) also can be quite revealing, giving employers insight into candidates’ dependability 
and trustworthiness. A recent study by the Society of Human Resource Managers reports that 
69 percent of employers conduct criminal background checks on all of their job candidates and 
47 percent of employers conduct credit checks. Fourteen percent of businesses do not conduct 
background checks on any job candidates, and small businesses are less likely to conduct back-
ground checks than large businesses.71 One expert says failing to conduct background checks on 
potential employees is the equivalent of walking up to a stranger and handing him or her the keys

Answers: 1. Legal. Employers can screen candidates on their current use of illegal drugs. 2. Illegal. Employers 
cannot ask about a candidate’s past drug addiction because drug addiction is covered by the Americans with
Disabilities Act; casual drug use, however, is not covered. 3. Illegal. Employers cannot ask about an applicant’s 
arrest record, but they can ask whether a candidate has ever been convicted of a crime.

4. Legal. Although employers 
cannot ask about a candidate’s arrest record, they can ask whether he or she has been convicted of a crime. 5. Illegal. 
Employers cannot ask questions that could lead to discrimination against a particular group (e.g., women, physically 
challenged, and so on). 6. Legal. 7. Illegal. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans discrimination on the basis of race,
color, sex, religion, or national origin. 8. Legal. 9. Illegal. Unless a person’s physical characteristics are necessary for

10. Legal. 11. Illegal. Notice the fine line between question 10 and question 11; this is what makes interviewing so 
challenging. 12. Illegal. This question violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 13. Illegal. What relevance would this 
have to an employee’s job performance? 14. Illegal. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits
discrimination against people with disabilities, people who are HIV positive or have AIDS are considered “disabled.”
15. Illegal. Workers who file workers’ compensation suits are protected from retribution by a variety of federal and 
state laws. 16. Illegal. This question also violates the Americans with Disabilities Act. 17. Illegal. This question
violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 18. Currently legal—but creepy—and creates the possibility that employers

the type of background check conducted and the applicant’s job duties and must conduct the
background check for all applicants for the job. Employers also should have applicants sign a
l
separate disclosure document authorizing the employer to conduct a background check.
Checking potential employees’ social networking pages such as Facebook, Twitter, and 
LinkedIn also can provide a revealing look at their character. A study by CareerBuilder reports 
that 39 percent of employers investigate job candidates’ social networking sites and that 43 per-
cent have discovered something there that caused them to reject a candidate (see Figure 16.2).73

LO3
Explain how to create 
a company culture that 
encourages employee 
retention.
Although many business owners see checking references as a formality and pay little at-
tention to it, others realize the need to protect themselves (and their customers) from hiring 
unscrupulous workers. Is it really necessary? Yes! According to a survey of hiring professionals, 
53 percent of candidates either exaggerate or falsify information on their résumés.74 Yahoo Inc. 
once fired its CEO just five months after hiring him when the company’s board of directors dis-
covered that his résumé contained false information about his academic credentials.75 Checking
references thoroughly can help employers uncover false or exaggerated information. Rather than
contacting only the references listed, experienced employers call applicants’ previous employers 
and talk to their immediate supervisors to get a clear picture of the applicant’s job performance, 
character, and work habits. At Bonobos, an online menswear company, managers conduct “off-
list” reference checks, contacting people who have worked with a candidate but are not listed as 
references on the candidate’s résumé. Andy Dunn, cofounder and CEO, says that in most cases,
these off-list references enhance a candidate’s application, but on occasion they have alerted the 
company to problem areas in a candidate’s background. Using LinkedIn to find common connec-
tions to former employers, colleagues, or employees is an efficient way to expand a candidate’s 
reference pool.76
Many employers implement a probationary trial period for new hires that may range from
two weeks to several months. Doing so increases the probability that the company has found the
right person for the job. After two weeks on the job at Whole Foods Market, team members of 
new hires vote on whether to keep the new employees or to let them go.77
Experienced small business owners understand that the hiring process provides them with
one of the most valuable raw materials their companies count on for success—capable, hard-
working people. They know that hiring an employee is not a single event but rather the beginning 
of a long-term relationship. Table 16.7 features some strange but true incidents that employers 
have encountered during the selection process.
Creating an Organizational Culture That Encourages 
Employee Motivation and Retention
Culture
A company’s culture is the distinctive, unwritten, informal code of conduct that governs its be-
havior, attitudes, relationships, and style. It is the essence of “the way we do things around here.” 
In many small companies, culture plays as important a part in gaining a competitive edge as 
strategy does. Culture has a powerful impact on the way people work together in a business, how 
they do their jobs, and how they treat their customers. Company culture manifests itself in many 
ways—from how workers dress and act to the language they use. For instance, at some compa-
nies, the unspoken dress code requires workers to wear suits and ties, but at others employees
routinely come to work in jeans and T-shirts. At CustomInk, a company founded by three former 
college classmates, Marc Katz, Mike Driscoll, and Dave Christensen, that makes custom T-shirts, 
the dress code includes jeans, flip-flops, and (no surprise) T-shirts. However, the company

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
TABLE 16.7 Strange but True!
Human resource managers typically review résumés and job applications quickly. In fact, 68 percent of hiring managers say they 
spend less than two minutes on average reviewing a résumé or application, and 17 percent of hiring managers spend no more than 
30 seconds on average reviewing resumes. If you read enough résumés, conduct enough interviews, and check enough references, 
sooner or later you will encounter something bizarre. Consider the following examples (all true):
● 
During the interview, one candidate answered a phone call to set up an interview with a competitor of the company with which he 
was interviewing.
● 
One candidate for a management position listed “gator hunting” as a skill on his résumé. Another candidate included “versatile 
toes” as a strength on her résumé.
● 
One applicant’s résumé was written in Klingon, a fictional language spoken by humanoid warriors from Star Trek. Another 
candidate acted out a Star Trek role during the interview.
k
● 
When interviewing for a job that required working in Antarctica, one candidate claimed that he spoke “Antarctican.”
● 
After having lunch with a job candidate, a business owner took the applicant to her office for more discussion. The discussion 
ended, however, when the applicant dozed off and began snoring.
● 
One candidate decorated her résumé with pink rabbits. Another applicant revealed that her résumé was set up to be sung to the
tune of “The Brady Bunch.”
● 
One candidate walked into the interviewer’s office, picked up the candy dish on her desk, and emptied its entire contents into her 
pocket.
● 
When asked what person, living or dead, he would most like to meet, one candidate replied, “The living one.”
● 
One applicant checked his Facebook page during the interview, and another kept her iPod headphones in her ears during the 
interview.
● 
One candidate popped his false teeth out of his mouth when discussing dental benefits with the interviewer.
● 
One candidate wore a Boy Scout uniform to his interview but never explained to the interviewers why.
● 
A candidate explained that promptness was one of her strengths—even though she showed up 10 minutes late for the interview. 
● 
On his résumé, a candidate for an accounting position described himself as “detail-oriented” and spelled the company’s name
incorrectly.
● 
During an interview, one candidate asked the interviewer, “What company is this again?” Another asked the interviewer if he could 
have a sip of the interviewer’s coffee.
● 
During the interview, one candidate told the interviewer that he wanted a job that did not require him to “work a lot.”
● 
One candidate asked if he could bring his rabbit to work with him, adding that the rabbit was focused and reliable but that he 
himself had been fired before.
● 
One man who forgot to wear socks to his interview remedied the problem by coloring his ankles with a black felt-tip marker.
● 
One candidate asked the interviewer for a hug at the end of the interview.
Recommendations from previous employers can sometimes be quite entertaining too. The following are statements from managers 
about workers:
● 
“Works well when under constant supervision and cornered like a rat in a trap.”
● 
“This young lady has delusions of adequacy.”
● 
“A photographic memory but with the lens cover glued on.”
● 
“If you were to give him a penny for his thoughts, you’d get change.”
● 
“If you stand close enough to him, you can hear the ocean.”
● 
“He’s so dense that light bends around him.

slogan, “Don’t let the flip-flops fool ya,’” characterizes the company’s 
strong work ethic and expectation of high performance.78 Although it is 
an intangible characteristic, a company’s culture has a powerful influ-
ence on everyone the company touches, especially its employees, and on 
the company’s ultimate success.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Eileen Fisher: Eileen Fisher At 
Eileen Fisher, a clothing company named for its dynamic founder,
the culture conveys a strong sense of family, unity, and social responsibil-
ity. Founder Eileen Fisher relies on a participative style of management,
and employees, who work in six offices and 63 stores across the United 
States, enjoy flexible work schedules and a unique set of benefits, includ-
ing a generous $3,000 clothing allowance on top of their employee dis-
counts and paid sabbaticals. They also receive an annual $1,000 wellness 
allowance and free in-office or in-store massages every month. In 2006, 
Fisher created an employee stock ownership plan through which her 
employees own nearly one-third of the company and share in its profits. Eileen Fisher also gives 
back to local communities by matching employees’ contributions to charities and allowing an
employee-controlled committee to decide how to allocate grants the company donates. Fisher 
compares her company to a garden in which she planted seeds and now has the joy of watching 
it grow and thrive.79 ■
An important ingredient in a company’s culture is the performance objectives an entrepre-
neur sets and against which employees are measured. If entrepreneurs want integrity, respect, 
honesty, customer service, and other important values to be the foundation on which a posi-
tive culture can flourish, they must establish measures of success that reflect those core values.
Effective executives know that building a positive organizational culture has a direct, positive 
impact on the financial performance of an organization. The intangible factors that make up an 
organization’s culture have an influence, either positive or negative, on the tangible outcomes of 
profitability, cash flow, return on equity, employee productivity, innovation, and cost control. An 
entrepreneur’s job is to create a culture that has a positive influence on the company’s tangible 
outcomes.
Sustaining a company’s culture begins with the hiring process. Beyond the normal require-
ments of competitive pay and working conditions, the hiring process must focus on finding em-
ployees who share the values of the organization. In winning workplaces, entrepreneurs build a 
culture of trust, treat their workers fairly, respect their personal lives, provide opportunities for 
growth and advancement, and provide them with jobs that are interesting, meaningful, and fun. 
The result is a team of people who give their best ideas and efforts to the business.80
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Aaron Levie and Dylan Smith: Box.net At Box.net, a 
cloud software development company in Los Altos, California, cofounders Aaron Levie and 
Dylan Smith expect their employees to invest long hours to meet their weekly project deadlines. 
In their hiring process, they look for software engineers who are highly competitive and hard
driving—the “I-can’t-rest-until-I’ve-noodled-out-an-answer” types. To attract those types of work-
ers, Levie and Smith say they spend a significant portion of their time building the right culture. 
They reward their hardworking employees with perks such as swing sets and ping-pong tables to 
relieve stress, free dinners, and facilities so that workers can sleep and shower if they stay late to 
work on a project. Box.net also encourages collaboration and innovation with its semiannual 
Hackathon, an event in which teams of employees take new product ideas from early stage to 
implementation in a single night. Levie and Smith have successfully created a culture of “we’re all 
in this together” in which the company’s approval rating among employees is an impressive 
97 percent.81 ■
Creating a culture that supports a company’s strategy is no easy task, but entrepreneurs who 
have been most successful at it believe that having a set of overarching beliefs serves as a pow-
erful guide for everyday action. Culture arises from an entrepreneur’s consistent and relentless
pursuit of a set of core values that everyone in the company can believe in. “Values outlive busi-
ness models,” says management guru Gary Hamel.82

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Nurturing the right culture in a company can enhance a company’s competitive position 
by improving its ability to attract and retain quality workers and by creating an environment in 
which workers can grow and develop. As a new generation of employees enters the workforce, 
companies are discovering that more relaxed, open cultures have an edge in attracting the best 
workers. These companies embrace nontraditional, fun cultures that incorporate concepts such 
as casual dress, team-based assignments, telecommuting, flexible work schedules, free meals,
company outings, and many other unique options. Barbara Corcoran, a regular on the televi-
sion show Shark Tank, built her company, The Corcoran Group, into the largest residential real 
estate brokerage firm in New York by creating a fun, engaging culture, which is a reflection of 
her leadership style. “The more fun I created in the company, the more creative and innovative it 
became,” she says. “Fun is the most underutilized tool in the leadership tool belt,” according to
Corcoran, who started her business with a $1,000 loan and ultimately sold it for $66 million.83
Modern organizational culture relies on several principles that are fundamental to creating a 
productive, fun workplace that enables employees and the company to excel.
RESPECT FOR WORK AND LIFE BALANCE Successful companies recognize that their employees
have lives away from work. Generation X and Millennial workers, in particular, want to work 
for companies that erase the traditional barriers between home life and work life by making it 
easier for them to deal with the pressures they face away from their jobs. These businesses offer 
flexible work schedules, part-time jobs, job sharing, telecommuting, sabbaticals, and on-site day 
care and dry cleaning.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Pamela Noble: Noble-Davis Consulting Noble-Davis 
Consulting, a retirement plan administration and consulting service founded by Pamela 
Noble, not only attracts top-quality talent but also reaps the benefits of high productivity and 
employee retention by emphasizing work–life balance. The company provides its employees with
flexible work schedules, self-determined vacations, and the opportunity to work from home when 
appropriate, benefits that allow employees to more easily balance their work–life demands. 
Meeting team goals calls for special celebrations, including bowling and movie nights or Whirly-
ball outings. Employees also can earn year-end performance bonuses, some of which have ex-
ceeded $20,000.84 ■
A SENSE OF PURPOSE As you learned in Chapter 5, one of the most important jobs an entrepreneur 
faces is defining the company’s vision and then communicating it effectively to everyone the 
company touches. Effective companies use a strong sense of purpose to make employees feel 
connected to the company’s mission. Anne Wojcicki, founder of 23andMe, a company based in 
Mountain View, California, that provides genetic testing services, emphasizes the importance
of linking every employee’s job to the company’s mission (“to be the world’s trusted source of 
personal genetic information”). Everyone in the company, including Wojcicki, sets individual 
and team goals for the next six months that are distributed throughout the company. Each 
week, everyone in the company writes a weekly summary of his or her progress toward those 
goals. Every employee receives the summaries, and Wokcicki spends an hour reading them and 
following up with questions.85
A SENSE OF FUN For some companies, the line between work and play is blurred. The founders
of these businesses see no reason for work and fun to be mutually exclusive. In fact, they
believe that a workplace that creates a sense of fun makes it easier to recruit quality workers and
encourages them to be more productive and more customer oriented. “Healthy and sustainable 
organizations focus on the fundamentals: quality, service, fiscal responsibility, leadership—but 
they didn’t forget to add fun to that formula,” says Leslie Yerkes, a consultant and author.86 Once
a month, former collegiate athlete Missy Park, founder of Title Nine, a maker of women’s fitness
and athletic apparel, and her employees in the company’s Berkeley, California, offices participate
in impromptu exercises, such as bouncy ball races. Once a year, employees compete in the Title 
Nine Olympics, which includes kickball, dodge ball, tugs-of-war, office chair foosball, and other 
unusual sports. The winning team gets a paid day off.87
ENGAGEMENT Employees who are fully engaged in their work take pride in making valuable 
contributions to the organization’s success and derive personal satisfaction from doing so. 

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
649
Although engaged employees are a key ingredient in superior business performance, just 
30 percent of employees in North America are fully engaged in their work, and 18 percent actually 
are disengaged.88 Research shows that disengaged employees have higher turnover, accident,
and absenteeism rates than the average employee, are more likely to steal from their employers,
and are more likely to drive customers away. Disengaged workers also are less productive than 
engaged employees, costing U.S. companies between $450 billion and $550 billion a year.89
Employees become disengaged when they are disconnected from the company’s culture, when 
they lack opportunities for growth and advancement, when they don’t believe the company 
values, and when they believe they are not compensated fairly for their contributions. What can 
managers do to improve employee engagement?
● Recognize and reward employees for top performance.
● Constantly communicate the purpose and vision of the organization and why it matters.
● Challenge employees to learn and advance in their careers and give them the resources and 
the incentives to do so.
● Create a culture that encourages and rewards engagement.
Engaged employees are the drivers of innovative ideas and new customers and revenues that every 
company, especially small ones, require to thrive. Research shows that companies with higher 
percentages of engaged employees generate higher earnings per share than those with lower per-
centages of engaged employees.90 Figure 16.3 shows the factors that drive employee engagement.
DIVERSITY Companies with appealing cultures not only accept cultural diversity in their workforces 
but embrace it, actively seeking out workers with different backgrounds. Today, businesses must 
recognize that a workforce that has a rich mix of cultural diversity gives the company more talent, 
skills, and abilities from which to draw. A study of the demographics of the United States reveals a 
steady march toward an increasingly diverse population. In fact, demographic trends suggest that 
by 2043, minority groups, including Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and other nonwhite 
groups, will make up the majority (53 percent) of the U.S. population.91 For companies to remain 
relevant in this environment, their workforces must reflect this diversity (see Figure 16.4). Who 
is better equipped to deal with a diverse, multicultural customer base than a diverse, multicultural 
workforce?
FIGURE 16.3
Drivers of Employee Engagement
Aon Hewitt, a leading human resources consulting 
firm, has developed the following model of em-
ployee engagement on the basis of responses from 
more than 7 million employees in more than 
6,000 companies around the world. The model shows 
six drivers of engagement (the basics, company prac-
tices, the work, performance, leadership, and brand) 
in employees’ work experience and their outcomes:
Say – Engaged employees speak positively about 
the organization.
Stay – Engaged employees have an intense sense of 
belonging to the organization.
Strive – Engaged employees are motivated and 
work to achieve success in their jobs.
The model also identifies four categories of 
positive business outcomes (talent, operational,
customer, and financial) that result from highly 
engaged employees.

INTEGRITY Employees want to work for companies that stand for honesty and integrity. They
do not want to check their own personal values systems at the door when they report to work. 
Indeed, many workers take pride in the fact that they work for companies that are ethical and
socially responsible. People want to work for a company that makes a difference in the world
rather than merely making a product or providing a service. Putney, a Portland, Maine, company 
that makes generic drugs for pets, gives both money and time back to the local community and 
gives its 57 employees paid time off to volunteer at local nonprofit organizations, including its 
partner agency, the Animal Refuge League of Greater Portland.92
PARTICIPATIVE MANAGEMENT Today’s workers do not respond well to the autocratic management 
styles of yesteryear. Company owners and managers must learn to trust and empower employees 
at all levels of the organization to make decisions and to take the actions they need to do their jobs
well. As a company grows, managers must empower employees at all levels to act without direct 
supervision. A study by consulting firm McKinsey and Company reports a strong correlation 
among the quality of a decision, clarity concerning the person responsible for implementing the 
decision, and that person’s involvement in the decision-making process.93
LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Progressive companies encourage and support lifelong learning 
among their employees. They are willing to invest in their employees, improving their skills 
and helping them to reach their full potential. These companies are magnets for the best and the 
brightest young workers who know that to stay at the top of their fields, they must always be 
learning. Every year, Noble-Davis Consulting, the retirement plan administration and consulting 
firm, creates a budget for each employee to participate in outside training, classes, and educational 
courses. To enhance employees’ skills, the company also sponsors monthly in-house workshops, 
seminars, and Webinars.94
Job Design
Over the years, managers have learned that the job itself and the way it is designed is an important 
factor in a company’s ability to attract and retain quality workers. In some companies, work is 
organized on the principle of job simplification, breaking the work down into its simplest form
and standardizing each task, as in some assembly-line operations. The scope of jobs organized 
in such a way is extremely narrow, resulting in impersonal, monotonous, and boring work that 
creates little challenge or motivation for workers. Job simplification invites workers to “check 
their brains at the door” and offers them little opportunity for excitement, enthusiasm, or pride
in their work. The result can be apathetic, unmotivated workers who don’t care about quality, 
customers, or costs.
To break this destructive cycle, some companies have redesigned workers’ jobs. The follow-
ing strategies are common: job enlargement, job rotation, job enrichment, flextime, job sharing, 
and flexplace.

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
651
Job enlargement (horizontal job loading) adds more tasks to a job to broaden its scope. For 
instance, rather than an employee simply mounting four screws in computers coming down an 
assembly line, a worker might assemble, install, and test the entire motherboard (perhaps as part 
of a team). The idea is to make the job more varied and to allow employees to perform a more 
complete unit of work.
Job rotation involves cross training employees so that they can move from one job in the 
company to others, giving them a greater number and variety of tasks to perform. As employees 
learn other jobs within an organization, both their skills and their understanding of the company’s 
purpose and processes rise. Cross-trained workers are more valuable because they give a com-
pany the flexibility to shift workers from low-demand jobs to those where they are most needed. 
As an incentive for workers to learn to perform other jobs within an operation, some companies 
offer skill-based pay, a system under which the more skills workers acquire, the more they earn.
Job enrichment (vertical job loading) involves building motivators into a job by increasing 
the planning, decision-making, organizing, and controlling functions—traditionally managerial 
tasks—that workers perform. The idea is to make every employee a manager (at least one of his 
or her own job).
To enrich employees’ jobs, a business owner must build five core characteristics into them:
● Skill variety is the degree to which a job requires a variety of different skills, talents, and 
activities from the worker. Does the job require the worker to perform a variety of tasks
that demand a variety of skills and abilities, or does it force him or her to perform the same 
task repeatedly?
● Task identity is the degree to which a job allows the worker to complete a whole or identifi-
able piece of work. Does the employee build an entire piece of furniture (perhaps as part of 
a team), or does he or she merely attach four screws?
● Task significance is the degree to which a job substantially influences the lives or work of 
others—other employees or final customers. Does the employee get to deal with customers,
either internal or external? One effective way to establish task significance is to put employees 
in touch with customers so they can see how customers use the product or service they make.
● Autonomy is the degree to which a job gives a worker the freedom, independence, and 
discretion in planning and performing tasks. Does the employee make decisions affecting 
his or her work, or must he or she rely on someone else (e.g., the owner, a manager, or a 
supervisor) to “call the shots”? At Intuit, employees have the autonomy to spend 10 percent 
of their time working on projects they believe will benefit the company.95
● Feedback is the degree to which a job gives the worker direct, timely information about the
k
quality of his or her performance. Does the job give the employee feedback about the qual-
ity of his or her work, or does the product (and all information about it) simply disappear 
after it leaves the worker’s station?
A study conducted by researchers at the University of New Hampshire and the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics concludes that employees of companies that use job enrichment principles are more 
satisfied than those who work in jobs designed using principles of simplification.96
Flextime is an arrangement under which employees work a normal number of hours but have
flexibility about when they start and stop work. Most flextime arrangements require employees to 
build their work schedules around a set of “core hours,” such as 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., but give them 
the freedom to set their schedules outside of those core hours. For instance, one worker might 
choose to come in at 7 a.m. and leave at 3 p.m. to attend her son’s soccer game, and another may 
work from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Flextime not only raises worker morale but also makes it easier for 
companies to attract high-quality young workers who want rewarding careers without sacrificing 
their lifestyles. In addition, companies using flextime schedules often experience lower levels of 
tardiness, turnover, and absenteeism.

part in attracting skilled, high-tech workers whom the company relies on for its success. “We’re
more focused on the job and delivering on client expectations than on how, when, and where our 
employees work,” she says.97  ■
Flextime is becoming an increasingly popular job design strategy, especially among small
companies. A recent study by the Families and Work Institute found that 77 percent of U.S. 
businesses give at least some of their employees flexible schedules, up from 68 percent in
1998. However, 32 percent of small companies (fewer than 100 employees) offer most or all of 
their employees flexible schedules, compared to just 16 percent of large companies (more than 
1,000 employees).98 The number of companies using flextime will continue to grow as compa-
nies find recruiting capable, qualified full-time workers more difficult and as technology makes 
working from a dedicated office space less important. Research shows that when considering 
job offers, candidates, particularly members of Generation Y, weigh heavily the flexibility of the 
work schedule that companies offer.99
Job sharing is a work arrangement in which two or more people share a single full-time 
job. For instance, two college students might share the same 40-hour-a-week job, one working 
mornings and the other working afternoons. Salary and benefits are prorated between the work-
ers sharing a job. Because job sharing is a simple solution to the growing challenge of life–work 
balance, it is becoming more popular. Companies already using it are finding it easier to recruit 
and retain qualified workers.
Flexplace is a work arrangement in which employees work at a place other than the 
traditional office, such as a satellite branch closer to their homes or, in many cases, at home. 
Flexplace is an easy job design strategy for companies to use because of telecommuting. Using
modern communication technology such as WiFi, smart phones, texting, intranets, e-mail on-
line workspaces, and project management software, employees have more flexibility in choos-
ing where they work. Today, connecting electronically to the workplace (and to all of the people 
and the information there) from practically anywhere on the planet is quite simple for many
workers. Research by market research firm Ipsos shows that 60 percent of employees around 
the world would telecommute if their employers allowed it.100 The Telework Research Network 
estimates that 45 percent of workers in the United States have the potential to telecommute at 
least some of the time.101 However, only 4 percent of employees in North America telecommute
full-time (26 percent telecommute at least once per week), well below the global average of 
7 percent (36.5 percent telecommute at least once per week).102 Telecommuting employees get 
the flexibility they seek, and they also benefit from reduced commuting times and expenses, 
not to mention a less expensive wardrobe (bathrobes and bunny slippers compared to busi-
ness suits and wingtips). Companies reap many benefits as well, including improved employee 
morale, less absenteeism, lower turnover, higher productivity, and more satisfied, more loyal 
employees. Studies show that telecommuting can reduce employee turnover by 20 percent and 
increase productivity between 15 and 20 percent.103 Even though many small companies are 
ideally suited for telecommuting, large companies use this job design strategy more than small 
companies.104
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Anne Wojcicki: 23andMe Anne Wojcicki, founder of 
23andMe, the genetic testing service, offers her company’s 70 employees both flextime and
flexplace options. Wojcicki herself often works from home, not coming into the office until late
morning or early afternoon. She says she actually encourages people to work wherever they can
be most productive, whether it is at a café, at home, or in the office.105 ■
Motivating Employees to Higher Levels  
of Performance: Rewards and Compensation
Another important aspect of creating a culture that attracts and retains quality workers is estab-
lishing a robust system of rewards and compensation. The rewards that an employee gets from 
the job itself are intrinsic rewards, but managers have at their disposal a wide variety of extrinsic 
rewards (those outside the job itself) to attract, retain, and motivate workers. The keys to using 
rewards to motivate are linking them to performance and tailoring them to the needs and char-
acteristics of the workers. Entrepreneurs must base rewards and compensation on what is really 
important to their employees. For instance, to a technician making $30,000, a chance to earn a 
job sharing
a work arrangement in 
which two or more people 
share a single full-time job.

a work arrangement in 
which employees work

$3,000 performance bonus would most likely be a powerful motivator. To an executive earning 
$175,000 a year, it may not be.
One of the most popular rewards is money. Not surprisingly, a recent survey by the Society 
for Human Resource Management reports that 96 percent of employees rated compensation as 
either important or very important to their job satisfaction.106 Cash is an effective motivator—up 
to a point. Simple performance bonuses are a common reward at many companies. The closer the 
bonus payment is to the action that prompted it, the more effective it will be.
Some companies have moved to pay-for-performance compensation systems, in which em-
ployees’ pay depends on how well they perform their jobs. In other words, extra productivity
equals extra pay. By linking employees’ compensation directly to the company’s financial perfor-
mance, a business owner increases the likelihood that workers will achieve performance targets 
that are in their best interest and in the company’s best interest. Pay-for-performance systems work 
only when employees see a clear connection between their job performance and their pay, however.
That’s where small businesses have an advantage over large businesses. Because they work for 
small companies, employees can see more clearly the impact that their performances have on the 
company’s profitability and ultimate success than their counterparts at large corporations.
Some companies offer their employees financial rewards in the form of profit-sharing plans
in which employees receive a portion of the company’s profits. At Badger Mining, a family-
owned sand extractor located in Berlin, Wisconsin, employees participate in a generous quarterly
profit-sharing plan. The company also offers performance-based bonuses in addition to the profit-
sharing program. The result is an employee turnover rate that is virtually nil, with 95 percent of 
employees saying they intend to retire from Badger Mining.107 A few companies have gone even 
further, coupling profit sharing plans with open-book management, a system in which entrepre-
neurs share openly their companies’ financial results with employees. The goal is teach employees
how their job performances have a direct impact on profits and to give them an incentive for im-
proving the company’s bottom line. “Open book [management] gives everyone the chance to see 
what we need to do to succeed,” says Jack Stack, CEO of SRC Holdings, a holding company of 
26 employee-owned businesses and a longtime advocate of open-book management.108
Money isn’t the only motivator business owners have at their disposal, of course. In fact, 
money tends to be only a short-term motivator. In addition to the financial compensation they 
provide, most companies offer their employees a wide array of benefits, ranging from stock op-
tions and health insurance to retirement plans and tuition reimbursement. Stock options, a plan 
under which the employees can purchase shares of a company’s stock at a fixed price, have be-
come a popular benefit for employees. Employees at Putney, Inc., a business in Portland, Maine, 
that makes generic drugs for pets, receive stock options in the fast-growing company.109 Stock 
options take on real value once the market price of a company’s stock exceeds the exercise price, 
the price at which employees can purchase stock. (Note that if the fair market price of a stock 
never exceeds the exercise price, the stock option is useless.) When trying to attract and retain 
quality employees, many small companies rely on stock options to gain an edge over larger 
companies offering bigger salaries. Stock options produce a huge payoff for employees when 
companies succeed. Workers at highly successful companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Dell 
have retired as multimillionaires thanks to stock options.
Benefits packages also are an important part in attracting and retaining quality workers and 
achieving high productivity. A recent survey by MetLife shows that employees who are satis-
fied with their benefits demonstrate more loyalty to their employers and are less likely to leave 
than those who are not. The most important benefit? Health insurance.110 Integrated Project

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
cafeteria benefit plan
a plan under which employ-
ers provide certain basic 
benefits and then allocate 
a specific dollar amount 
for employees to select the 
benefits that best suit their 
needs.
Management, a project management consulting firm based in Burr Ridge, Illinois, not only cov-
ers 100 percent of healthcare premiums for its employees and their families but also offers a 
comprehensive wellness program designed to keep workers healthy.111
In an economy in which they must compete aggressively for employees, entrepreneurs must 
recognize that compensation and benefits no longer follow a “one-size-fits-all” pattern. The di-
versity of today’s workforce requires employers to be highly flexible and innovative with the 
compensation and benefits they provide. To attract and retain quality workers, creative entre-
preneurs offer employees benefits designed to appeal to their employees’ particular needs. This 
diversity has led to the popularity of cafeteria benefit plans, in which employers provide certain 
base benefits and then allocate a specific dollar amount for employees to select the benefits that 
suit their needs best. To provide the best package of benefits most efficiently, employers should 
survey their employees periodically to discover which benefits are most important to them and 
then build their benefits package to include them. Online shoe retailer Zappos, which is consis-
tently listed as one of Fortune’s “Top 100 Companies to Work For,” conducts benefits surveys of 
its employees throughout the year and adjusts its benefits package accordingly.112
Beyond flexible benefits plans, many small companies are setting themselves apart from 
others by offering unique benefits, including the following:
● At every five-year anniversary with the company, employees at Ruby Receptionists, an 
agency based in Portland, Oregon, that provides virtual receptionist services for small busi-
nesses, receive a five-week paid sabbatical during which they are encouraged to explore 
some aspect of the company’s core values (“foster happiness, create community, innovate, 
and practice WOW-ism”) and apply them to a goal that they might not otherwise have time 
to accomplish. The company also supplements employees’ sabbaticals with $1,000 to help 
them reach their goals, whether it involves traveling to a far-away land, taking a class, or 
assisting a nonprofit organization.113
● ENGEO, an engineering consulting company in San Ramon, California, provides a “dream 
manager,” who works with employees to help them realize their personal and profes-
sional goals, from buying a home to advancing in their careers. Employees also own a 
portion of the company through an employee stock ownership plan and participate in 
company-sponsored ice cream socials and chili cook-offs.114
● Employees at ClifBar, a company founded by copreneurs Gary Erickson and Kit Crawford 
that makes energy bars, can scale a 22-foot-high climbing wall in the company gym. Em-
ployees also get 2.5 hours of paid time each week to work out in the gym, which is staffed 
by five personal trainers. To celebrate the company’s twentieth anniversary, Erickson and 
Crawford gave all 340 employees commuter bicycles.115
Many small business owners whose companies may not be able to afford benefits such as 
these find other ways to reward their employees, including vacation days on their birthdays, an 
occasional catered lunch (especially after completing a big project successfully), and free tickets 
to a local game, movie, or performance.
Besides the wages, salaries, and attractive benefits they use as motivators, creative entre-
preneurs have discovered that intangible incentives can be more important sources of employee 
motivation. After its initial impact, money loses its effectiveness; it does not have a lasting mo-
tivational effect (which for small businesses, with their limited resources, is a plus). For many 
workers, the most meaningful motivational factors are the simplest ones—recognition, praise, 
feedback, job security, promotions, and others—things that any small business, no matter how
limited its budget, can do. Dylan Johnson, a bartender at the Truck Yard, a unique bar in Dallas, 
Texas, that includes an indoor bar and an outdoor beer garden with a tree house bar and an Air-
stream bar, says simple recognition from a manager, such as a “thank you” for staying an extra 
hour or doing something beyond the normal requirements of the job inspires workers to excel.116
One recent study concludes that recognition leads to increased employee satisfaction. The study
also shows that employees who have been recognized at work within the previous six months are 
more likely to be highly engaged in their work.117
Praise is another simple yet powerful motivational tool. People enjoy getting praise, espe-
cially from a manager or business owner; it’s just human nature. As Mark Twain said, “I can live 

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
655
for two months on a good compliment.”* Praise is an easy and inexpensive reward for employees 
who produce extraordinary work. A short note to an employee for a job well done costs practi-
cally nothing, yet it can be a potent source of motivation. Barbara Corcoran, founder of The 
Corcoran Group, awarded her company’s top performers each week with colored ribbons and
annual “Salesperson of the Year” trophies as if they had just won an Olympic event. Corcoran 
realized that recognition often is a better motivator than money after visiting her top salesperson’s 
home and seeing a large cabinet in the middle of her living room in which she proudly displayed 
the five “Salesperson of the Year” trophies she had won.118 How often have you had an employer 
recognize you and say “thank you” for a job you performed well?
Because they lack the financial resources of bigger companies, small business owners must 
be more creative when it comes to giving rewards that motivate workers. In many cases, however, 
using rewards other than money gives small businesses an advantage because they usually have 
more impact on employee performance over time. Rewards do not have to be expensive to be 
effective. At ENGEO, the engineering consulting firm, employees who provide extraordinary 
service to clients receive the coveted “ENGEO Rocks” traveling rock award, an actual rock 
(the company provides geotechnical and hydrologic consulting services) that the outstanding 
employee proudly displays at his or her work station.119 Managers are not the only ones who 
can provide rewards. At Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade artisanal products based in 
Brooklyn, New York, workers recognize one another’s accomplishments by sending an e-mail 
to the Ministry of Unusual Business, a secretive group that rewards high-performing individuals
(and sometimes the entire company) with prizes and gifts.120
Entrepreneurs tend to rely more on nonmonetary rewards, such as praise, recognition, game 
tickets, dinners, letters of commendation, and others, to create a work environment in which em-
ployees take pride in their work, enjoy it, are challenged by it, and get excited about it. In other 
words, the employees act like owners of the business.
Management Succession: Passing the Torch of Leadership
More than 80 percent of all companies in the world are family owned, and their contributions 
to the global economy are significant. Family-owned businesses account for 70 to 90 percent of 
global GDP. In the United States alone, family businesses make up 90 percent of all businesses,
create 64 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product, employ 62 percent of the private sector 
workforce, and account for 65 percent of all wages paid. Not all family-owned businesses are 
small, however; 33 percent of Fortune 500 companies are family businesses. Family-owned com-
panies such as Wal-Mart, Ford, Mars, Cargill, and Winn-Dixie employ thousands of people and 
generate billions of dollars in annual revenue.121 Family firms also create 78 percent of the U.S.
economy’s net new jobs and are responsible for many famous products, including Heinz ketchup, 
Levi’s jeans, and classic toys, such as the Slinky and the Wiffle Ball.122
Unfortunately, the stumbling block for most family businesses is management succession.
Just when they are ready to make the transition from one generation of leaders to the next, family 
businesses are most vulnerable. Only about 30 percent of first-generation businesses survive into 
the second generation; of those that do survive, only 12 percent make it to the third generation, 
and just 3 percent make it to the fourth generation and beyond.123
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Mark Valade: Carhartt Carhartt, a maker of more than
800 products ranging from rugged canvas clothing and fire-resistant apparel to hoodies 
and boots, is a family business that has beaten the odds and survived into the fourth generation 
of family ownership. CEO Mark Valade is the great-grandson of Hamilton Carhartt, who started
the company in 1889 when he came up with the idea of making durable overalls for railroad 
workers. Every generation of Carhartt leaders since has overcome demanding challenges such as
surviving the depths of the Great Depression and battling the influx of cheap, imported compet-
ing goods from the Far East in the 1980s. Valade says one key to Carhartt’s longevity and contin-
ued success is its consistent commitment to its core values and a focus on making the best apparel 
for active workers. Valade’s daughter, Gretchen, representing the fifth generation of family own-
ership, recently graduated from college and now works for Carhartt.124 ■

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Smart entrepreneurs know that although they may be the driv-
ing force behind their businesses, their highly committed and en-
gaged employees are the real keys to their companies’ success. 
l
As a result, these entrepreneurs carefully select their employees, 
develop their talents through training and education, and create 
a culture that reflects the central role their employees play in the 
success of their businesses. Following are 10 lessons for creating 
a great workplace drawn from small companies that have been 
recognized as some of the best places to work.
Lesson 1. Take a long-term view of your business. 
Owners of small, privately held companies have a distinct 
advantage over managers in large, publicly held firms in that 
they can make decisions that are in the best interest of their 
companies and their employees for the long haul rather than 
managing to meet quarterly financial expectations. These 
companies are willing to sacrifice short-term results for long-
term stability and success. The entrepreneurs behind them also
know that their companies’ success hinges on their employ-
ees, and their company cultures reflect their emphasis on their 
workers. At CustomInk, the customized T-shirt company, the 
founders show their confidence in their employees by follow-
ing a promotion from within policy; 65 percent of the com-
pany’s current managers started in entry-level positions with 
the company. Great companies also create a culture of trust
among their workers. Nugget Market, a small chain of grocery 
stores in Sacramento, California, has never had a layoff since
the father-son team of William and Mack Stille opened the
first store in 1926. Nugget Market’s employee turnover rate
(a huge expense without an invoice) is just 14 percent per
year, compared to the industry average of 38.7 percent.
Lesson 2. Recognize your company’s responsibility to 
society. These leading small companies strive for more than 
profitability; they aim to make a difference in the world, both 
locally and globally, and they get their employees involved in 
their efforts. Etsy, the Web site that provides an online mar-
ketplace for artisans to sell their creations, recently became 
certified as a B corporation, a company that meets rigorous
standards of social and environmental responsibility and trans-
parency in its operations. Employees receive 40 hours of paid 
time off each year to volunteer for the nonprofit organization 
of their choice. A group of employees recently traveled to 
Alaska to teach artisans there how to sell their work on Etsy 
as part of a program designed to help people in remote loca-
tions with limited resources become successful entrepreneurs.
Lesson 3. Honest, open, two-way communication 
helps your company in good times and bad times.
Managers at these small companies recognize that good 
communication is a key to building trust with employees 
and to encouraging employees to participate in making 
decisions that make the workplace better. At Ideal Printers, 
a second-generation family-owned commercial printing com-
pany in St. Paul, Minnesota, sisters Lana Siewert-Olson and 
Joan Siewert-Cardona, use open-book management, sharing
with employees all of the company’s financial statements and 
teaching them how to read them. They say opening the com-
pany’s books allows employees to see how their jobs directly 
affect the company’s profits and their compensation because 
Ideal Printers also offers a profit-sharing plan. During a recent
recession, when business slowed, the company reduced every-
one’s pay by 10 percent (and has since restored the reduction)
but did not resort to layoffs, unlike many of its competitors.
Lesson 4. Teamwork counts. Managers at leading small 
companies understand that a genuine team spirit leads to 
innovation, unparalleled productivity, and a fun atmosphere
of camaraderie. They rely on team-based awards and recogni-
tion to encourage a team spirit and help employees under-
stand how their jobs fit into the “big picture.” At Nugget 
Market stores, every day begins with a motivational rally, 
during which team leaders and employees share important 
information and get energized for the day.
Lesson 5. Investing in your employees is one of the
best investments you can make. Great companies under-
stand that enhancing their employees’ skills benefits both 
the employee and the business. Managers at SmartPak, 
an online and catalog retailer of nutritional supplements, 
medicine, tack, and other equestrian supplies in Plymouth, 
Massachusetts, know that understanding the needs of 
horses and their riders is essential to the company’s success. 
Although most of the company’s employees own, ride, and 
show horses, not all do. SmartPak created SmartPak Univer-
sity, through which it offers a variety of courses to educate 
its employees about horses, their owners, and their unique

needs. The company’s New Hire Start Groups are designed to 
get new employees off to a good start, and its Barn Buddy 
program pairs non-riding employees with employees who are 
experienced equestrians to learn about horses—and to better 
understand the customers with whom they interact.
Lesson 6. Give your employees a real sense of owner-r
ship. Every employer’s dream is to have employees who act 
like owners of the company. The best way to achieve that 
is to make them owners of the company! Stan Sheetz, the 
second-generation owner of Sheetz, a chain of 437 con-
venience stores in six states, believes that allowing Sheetz 
employees to own part of the company increases their level 
of engagement. Sheetz created an employee stock ownership 
plan (ESOP), and employees who work at least 1,000 hours 
in a calendar year receive shares in the company through the 
ESOP based on their earnings and years of service. Even in the 
leading small companies that do not offer ESOPs, employees 
receive some kind of performance-based compensation, such 
as profit sharing or stock options. The result is an ownership 
mentality and a workforce that is dedicated to making the 
company successful.
Lesson 7. Encourage your employees to stay healthy.
With health care costs rising rapidly, smart business owners 
know that anything they can do to help their employees stay 
healthy not only lowers costs but also helps their employees 
lead better personal and work lives. Many of the leading small 
companies pay 100 percent of the cost of their employees’ 
health insurance. Others provide incentives for employees to 
improve their health by quitting smoking, reaching and main-
taining an ideal weight, or exercising regularly. Some com-
panies provide on-site exercise facilities or pay for employees 
memberships at local gyms. Etsy, the online marketplace for 
artisans, pays 80 percent of employees’ and their families’ 
health insurance premiums and encourages employees to live 
healthy lives by providing yoga classes (“EtsYoga”) and fit-
ness classes (“Fitsy” and “Sweatsy”), locally sourced gourmet 
lunches every Tuesday and Thursday, and a kitchen stocked 
with healthy snacks and drinks. Employees also enjoy bringing 
their dogs to work.
Lesson 8. Recognize your employees’ stellar perfor-r
mances publicly and privately—and often. The best 
small businesses make recognizing employees’ accomplish-
ments a top priority and use a unique system of rewards 
to reinforce a positive company culture. At The Clymb, an 
online marketplace for outdoor gear and adventure travel in 
Portland, Oregon, employees can recognize one another’s ac-
complishments by giving coworkers recognition cards called 
“Fist Bumps” that are posted in the kitchen for all to see. 
Company founders Kelly Dachtler and Cec Annett recently 
took their entire staff to Hawaii’s North Shore on a “work-
cation” as a reward for achieving an aggressive business goal. 
Employees worked shorter days and had the opportunity to 
Hands On . . . How To (continued)
take surfing lessons, snorkel, sight-see, and hang out on the 
beach. At Torch Technologies, recognition is not as elaborate
but no less effective. CEO Bill Roark recognizes employees’ 
outstanding performances with a handwritten thank-you let-
ter sent to their homes. “I get notes back from kids and wives 
that bring tears to my eyes,” he says.
Lesson 9. Let your employees have fun. Just because you 
are at work does not mean you cannot have fun. OtterBox, a 
fast-growing company in Fort Collins, Colorado, that makes 
protective cases for smart phones, e-readers, and tablets, is 
known for its fun-based culture. The company’s headquar-
ters features a spiral slide in addition to stairs, scooters that 
employees can use to get around, a self-service latte machine 
and soda fountain, game rooms with pinball and foosball ma-
chines, and aquariums. Employees participate in impromptu 
events such as Flash Fitness Sessions and Star Wars Starship 
flying contests. There is a business purpose behind all of the 
fun. CEO Brian Thomas says the goal is to create a culture
that fosters innovation and inspires passion. OtterBox also 
encourages employees to give back to their community by 
giving them 24 hours of paid time off each year to volunteer 
at a nonprofit organization and provides weekly updates on 
nonprofits in need of help.
Lesson 10. Give your employees the flexibility they 
need for work–life balance. Small companies that offer 
flextime, job sharing, telecommuting, and other flexible work 
arrangements have an edge when it comes to hiring the best 
workers. At outdoor retailer REI, employees enjoy flexible work 
schedules. Many of the company’s employees are outdoor en-
thusiasts and are committed to REI’s core values that include a
passion for the outdoors. That’s why managers have no prob-
lem with workers going out for bicycle rides, quick kayak trips, 
or taking their dogs out for a game of fetch on “Doggy Row” 
during “work hours” as long as the work gets done. Gener-r
ous benefits such as health insurance (including coverage for 
part-time employees who work at least 20 hours per week),
employee discounts on REI products, wellness programs, and
sabbatical leaves make working at REI more than just a job.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
The average life expectancy of a family business is 24 years, although some last much longer.125
For instance, the oldest family business in the world is Houshi Ryokan, an inn and spa that was built 
near a hot spring in Komatsu, Japan, in 718 by Gengoro Sasakiri. Today, the forty-sixth generation 
of Sasakiri’s descendants operate the inn, which can accommodate 450 guests in its 100 rooms.126
The primary causes of lack of continuity among family businesses are inadequate estate
planning, failure to create a management succession plan, and lack of funds to pay estate taxes.127
In addition, sibling rivalries, fights over control of the business, and personality conflicts often 
lead to nasty battles that can tear families apart and destroy once thriving businesses. The best 
way to avoid deadly turf battles and conflicts is to develop a succession plan for the company. 
Numerous studies have found a positive relationship between the existence of a management 
succession plan and the longevity of family businesses.
Most of the family businesses in existence today were started after World War II, and their 
founders are ready to pass the torch of leadership on to the next generation. Experts estimate 
that between 2012 and 2050, $27 trillion in wealth will be transferred from one generation to the
next, much of it through family businesses.128 For these companies to have a smooth transition
from one generation to the next, they must develop management succession plans. Unfortunately,
only slightly more than half of all business owners have created succession plans, and, somewhat 
surprisingly, younger business owners are more likely to have a plan than older owners (see 
Figure 16.5). Often, the reason for failing to develop a succession plan is that entrepreneurs are 
unwilling to make tough and potentially disruptive family-oriented decisions that require select-
ing their successors. Family feuds often erupt over who is (and is not) selected as the successor 
in the family business. Without a succession plan, however, family businesses face an increased
risk of faltering or failing in the next generation. Family businesses with the greatest probability 
of surviving are the ones whose owners prepare a succession plan well before it is time to pass 
the torch of leadership to the next generation. Succession planning also allows business owners
to minimize the impact of estate taxes on their businesses and on their successors’ wealth as well.
Succession planning reduces the tension and stress of a transition by gradually “changing the
guard.” A well-developed succession plan is like the smooth, graceful exchange of a baton between 
runners in a relay race. The new runner still has maximum energy; the concluding runner has al-
ready spent his or her energy by running at maximum speed. The athletes never come to a stop to 
exchange the baton; instead, the handoff takes place on the move. The race is a skillful blend of the 
talents of all team members; the exchange of leadership is so smooth and powerful that the business
never falters but accelerates, fueled by a new source of energy at each leg of the race.
HOW TO DEVELOP A MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION PLAN Creating a succession plan involves the 
following steps:
Step 1. Select the successor. There comes a time for even the most dedicated company 
founder to step down from the helm of the business and hand the reins over to 
the next generation. The entire population of the Baby Boomer generation (born

between 1946 and 1964), some 76.4 million people, will be 65 or older by 2030, 
and 60 percent of small business owners are Baby Boomers. As those Baby Boom-
ers retire (a Baby Boomer business owner retires every 57 seconds), they are creat-
ing a tidal wave of business transitions and sales as they look either to hand them 
over to the next generation or sell them.129 Unfortunately, many of these soon-to-
retire family business owners who intend to turn over their businesses to the next 
generation of family members have not yet identified their successors. They resist 
thinking about stepping away from the businesses they have built, but in the end,
every business owner exits the company he or she created.
At age 63, Richard Branson, the brash founder of the Vir-
gin Group, a collection of about 400 companies in indus-
tries that range from air travel and wine to balloon flights
and space travel, has yet to name his successor. However,
Branson’s daughter Holly, who left a career as a doctor,
now works for the Virgin Group as a special projects man-
ager and is learning about the vast collection of companies 
in the Virgin portfolio and honing her financial manage-
ment skills.130
Entrepreneurs should never assume that their chil-
dren want to take control of the family business, however. 
It is critical to remember at this juncture in the life of a 
business that children do not necessarily inherit their par-
ents’ entrepreneurial skills and interests. By leveling with 
the children about the business and their options regard-
ing a family succession, the owner will know which heirs, 
if any, are willing to assume leadership of the business.
When naming a successor, merit is a better standard 
to use than birth order or gender. More than one-third of family business founders 
say the next leader will be a woman, quite a change from just a generation ago.131
The key to selecting the right successor is to establish standards of performance, 
knowledge, education, and ability and then identify the person who most closely 
meets those standards.
When considering a successor, an entrepreneur should consider taking the 
following actions:
● Let family members, especially children, know that joining the business is not 
mandatory nor guaranteed. Family members’ goals, ambitions, and talents 
should be foremost in their career decisions, and the business does not owe 
jobs to people just because they are family members. Andrew Cornell, CEO 
of Cornell Iron Works, a family business that started in 1828 as a blacksmith
shop and now makes overhead doors for industrial, commercial, and residential 
customers, says part of the company’s success is its objective approach to hir-
ing family members. He points out that successful family businesses cannot be 
homes for wayward family members.
● Do not assume that a successor must always come from within the family. Sim-
ply being born into a family does not guarantee that a person will make a good
t
business leader. A recent survey by PriceWaterhouseCoopers reports that 
34 percent of leaders of family businesses in North America with succession 
plans say the next top manager will come from outside the family.132
● Give family members the opportunity to work outside the business first to 
learn firsthand how others conduct business. Working for others allows them to 
develop knowledge, confidence, and credibility before stepping back into the 
family business. Seventy percent of the successors who have been identified 
have full-time work experience outside the family business.133
One of the worst mistakes entrepreneurs can make is to postpone naming a 
successor until just before they are ready to step down. The problem is especially

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
acute when more than one family member works for the company and is inter-
ested in assuming leadership of it. Sometimes founders avoid naming successors
because they don’t want to hurt the family members who are not chosen to suc-
ceed them. However, both the business and the family will be better off if, after 
observing the family members as they work in the business, the founder picks a 
successor on the basis of that person’s skills and abilities.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Irwin and James Monroe Smucker: J. M. Smucker 
Company J. M. Smucker Company, the well-known maker of jams and jellies, has had 
five CEOs since James Monroe Smucker started the company in Orrville, Ohio, in 1897, and 
every one of them has been a member of the Smucker family. Well before Paul, the grandson 
of founder J. M., stepped down from the company’s helm in 1961, he named both of his sons,
Timothy and Richard Smucker as co-CEOs. Timothy and Richard currently are grooming their
sons, Mark Smucker and Paul Smucker Wagstaff, to become the fifth-generation coleaders of 
the company. Mark and Paul, both in their early forties, have held a variety of positions in the 
company and currently are in charge of two major divisions. “We would like for them to share
the CEO job,” says Richard, “but it’s not a fait accompli.”134 ■
Step 2. Create a survival kit for the successor. Once he or she identifies a successor,
an entrepreneur should prepare a survival kit and then brief the future leader on
its contents, which should include all of the company’s critical documents (wills, 
trusts, insurance policies, financial statements, bank accounts, key contracts, cor-
porate bylaws, and so forth). The founder should be sure that the successor reads
and understands all of the relevant documents in the kit.
Step 3. Groom the successor. Typically, founders transfer their knowledge to their suc-
cessors gradually over time. The discussions that set the stage for the transition
of leadership are time consuming and require openness by both parties. In fact, 
grooming a successor is the founder’s greatest teaching and development respon-
sibility, and it takes time and deliberate effort. To create ability and confidence in 
a successor, a founder must be:
● patient, realizing that the transfer of power is gradual and evolutionary and that 
the successor should earn responsibility and authority one step at a time until 
the final transfer of power takes place;
● willing to accept that the successor will make mistakes;
● skillful at using the successor’s mistakes as a teaching tool;
● an effective communicator and an especially tolerant listener;
● capable of establishing reasonable expectations for the successor’s
performance; and
● able to articulate the keys to the successor’s successful performance.
Grooming a successor can begin at an early age simply by involving children 
in the family business and observing which ones have the greatest ability and in-
terest in the company.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Rudolph, Tommy, and Thomas Young: Young Office
Young Office, an office supply and furnishings business in Greenville, South Carolina, is 
in its third generation of family ownership. Thomas Young, who became CEO in 2008, began
working in the business as a child, joined the company full-time as a sales representative after
graduating from college, and gradually worked his way up the ladder. His father, Tommy,
started working at Young Office as a warehouse employee and truck driver, learning the busi-
ness from his father, Rudolph, who founded the company in 1953. Thomas’s father, Tommy, 
invested years preparing Thomas to take over the family business, which each successor has 
reinvented to accommodate changes in the marketplace. When asked about his success, 
Thomas is quick to credit his father for teaching him the nuances of the business and then 
stepping away to allow him to lead the company according to his vision, which is built on the 
bedrock of the company’s values he learned growing up.135 ■
Step 4. Promote an environment of trust and respect. Another priceless gift a founder 
can leave a successor is an environment of trust and respect. Trust and respect on
the part of the founder and others fuel the successor’s desire to learn and excel and 

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
661
build the successor’s confidence in making decisions. Developing a competent suc-
cessor typically requires at least 5 to 10 years. Dan Cathy, now Chairman and CEO
of Chick-fil-A, the highly successful chicken sandwich chain founded in 1967 by 
his father, Truett, started working in the family business at age 9. He joined the 
company full-time after graduating from college, starting as a director of opera-
tions, where he opened 50 new stores. Over the next several years, Dan moved
up the ranks as vice president of operations and senior vice president. In 2001, he 
became president and CEO. In 2013, as part of a long-planned succession, Dan as-
sumed the mantle of chairman of the board from his then 92-year-old father.136
Empowering the successor by gradually delegating responsibilities creates an 
environment in which all parties can objectively view the growth and development of 
the successor. Customers, creditors, suppliers, and staff members develop confidence 
in the successor. The final transfer of power is not a dramatic, wrenching change but a 
smooth, coordinated passage. Founders must be careful at this stage to avoid the “med-
dling retiree syndrome” in which they continue to report for work after they have of-f
ficially stepped down and take control of matters that are no longer their responsibility. 
Doing so undermines a successor’s authority and credibility among workers quickly.
Step 5. Cope with the financial realities of estate and gift taxes. The final step in de-
veloping a workable management succession plan is structuring the transition to 
minimize the impact of estate, gift, and inheritance taxes on family members and 
the business. Entrepreneurs who fail to consider the impact of these taxes may 
force their heirs to sell a successful business just to pay the estate’s tax bill. Re-
cent tax legislation may reduce the impact of taxation on the continuity of family 
businesses. Currently, without proper estate planning, an entrepreneur’s family 
members incur a painful tax bite that can be as high as 40 percent (or more if the 
state also imposes an estate tax) when they inherit the business (see Table 16.8).
TABLE 16.8 Changes in the Estate and Gift Taxes
As the following table illustrates, Congress is constantly tinkering with the often punishing structures 
of estate and gift taxes. The federal estate tax is actually interwoven with the gift tax; the impact of the 
two taxes began differing in 2004. Congress repealed the estate tax originally in 2010 but reinstated it in 
2011. The following table shows how the exemptions and the maximum tax rates for the estate and gift 
taxes have changed over time.

However the federal laws governing estate taxes may change over the next few years, entrepreneurs 
whose businesses have been successful cannot afford to neglect estate planning. Even though the federal 
estate tax burden has eased somewhat, some states have increased their estate taxes.

stating that each agrees to

of the death or disability 
of one.

trustee holds for the trust’s

Entrepreneurs should be actively engaged in estate planning no later than age 45; 
those who start businesses early in their lives or whose businesses grow rapidly 
may need to begin as early as age 30. A variety of options exist that may prove to 
be helpful in reducing the estate tax liability. Each operates in a different fashion, 
but their objective remains the same: to remove a portion of business owners’ as-
sets from their estates so that when they die, those assets will not be subject to 
estate taxes. Many of these estate planning tools need time to work their magic, 
so the key is to put them in place early on in the life of the business.
BUY-SELL AGREEMENT One of the most popular estate planning techniques is the buy-sell 
agreement. A buy-sell agreement is a contract that co-owners often rely on to ensure the continuity 
of a business. In a typical arrangement, the co-owners create a contract stating that each agrees 
to buy the others out in case of the death or disability of one. That way, the heirs of the deceased 
or disabled owner can “cash out” of the business while leaving control of it in the hands of the 
remaining owners. The buy-sell agreement specifies a formula for determining the value of the 
business at the time the agreement is to be executed. One problem with buy-sell agreements is 
that the remaining co-owners may not have the cash available to buy out the disabled or deceased 
owner. To resolve this issue, many businesses purchase life and disability insurance for each of 
the owners in amounts large enough to cover the purchase price of their respective shares of 
the business.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Larry Jaffe and Bob Gross: Jaffe and Gross Larry Jaffe
and Bob Gross, co-owners of Jaffe and Gross, a successful jewelry store in Dayton, Ohio, 
failed to create a buy-sell agreement backed by insurance for their business. When Gross died sud-
denly of a heart attack, Jaffe did not have enough cash to purchase Gross’s share of ownership in
the business. Gross’s heirs, who inherited his shares of the business, had no interest in operating
the jewelry store, and without a buy-sell agreement or a succession plan in place, the 27-year-old
company folded. Jaffe has since launched his own jewelry store, Jaffe’s Jewelers, but admits that 
things would have been much easier had he and Gross taken the time to create a succession 
plan.137 ■
LIFETIME GIFTING The owner of a successful business may transfer money to his or her children 
(or other recipients) from the estate throughout his or her life. Current federal tax regulations 
allow individuals to make gifts of $14,000 per year, per parent, per recipient that are exempt from
federal gift taxes. The recipient is not required to pay tax on the $14,000 gift he or she receives,
and the donor must pay a gift tax only on the amount of a gift that exceeds $14,000. For instance, 
husband-and-wife business owners could give $1,680,000 worth of stock to their three children 
and their spouses over a period of 10 years without incurring any estate or gift taxes at all. To be 
an effective estate planning strategy, lifetime gifting requires time to work, meaning that business 
owners must create a plan for using it early on.
SETTING UP A TRUST A trust is a contract between a grantor (the company founder) and a trustee
(generally a bank officer or an attorney) in which the grantor gives to the trustee legal title to assets 
(e.g., stock in the company) that the trustee agrees to hold for the beneficiaries (the founder’s 
children). The beneficiaries can receive income from the trust, the property in the trust, or both 
at some specified time. Trusts can take a wide variety of forms, but two broad categories of trusts
are available: revocable trusts and irrevocable trusts. A revocable trust is one that a grantor can
change or revoke during his or her lifetime. Under present tax laws, however, the only trust that 
provides a tax benefit is an irrevocable trust, in which the grantor cannot require the trustee to 
return the assets held in trust. The value of the grantor’s estate is lowered because the assets in an
irrevocable trust are excluded from the value of the estate. However, an irrevocable trust places 
severe restrictions on the grantor’s control of the property placed in the trust. Although recent 
changes in tax laws have eliminated certain types of trusts as estate planning tools, business
owners use several types of irrevocable trusts to lower their estate tax liabilities:
● Irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT). This type of trust allows business owners to keep 
the proceeds of a life insurance policy out of their estates and away from estate taxes, free-
ing up that money to pay the taxes on the remainder of their estates. To get the tax benefit, 
irrevocable trust
a trust in which a grantor 
cannot require the trustee 
to return the assets held in 
trust.

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
663
business owners must be sure that the business or the trust (rather than the owners them-
selves) owns the insurance policy. The primary disadvantage of an ILIT is that if the owner 
dies within three years of establishing it, the insurance proceeds become part of the estate 
and are subject to estate taxes. Because the trust is irrevocable, it cannot be amended or re-
scinded once it is established. Like most trusts, ILITs must meet stringent requirements to 
be valid, and entrepreneurs should use experienced attorneys to create them.
● Irrevocable asset trust. An irrevocable asset trust is similar to a life insurance trust except 
that it is designed to pass the assets (such as stock in a family business) in the parents’ es-
tate on to their children. The children do not have control of the assets while the parents are 
living, but they do receive the income from those assets. On the parents’ death, the assets in
the trust go to the children without being subjected to the estate tax.
● Grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT). A GRAT is a special type of irrevocable trust 
and has become one of the most popular tools for entrepreneurs to transfer ownership of 
a business while maintaining control over it and minimizing estate taxes. Under a GRAT, 
an owner can put property (such as company stock) in an irrevocable trust for a minimum 
of two years. While the trust is in effect, the grantor (owner) retains the benefits associated 
with the assets in the trust (e.g., the voting rights associated with the stock) and receives
interest income (calculated at a fixed interest rate that is determined by the Internal Rev-
enue Service [IRS]) from the assets in the trust. At the end of the trust, the property passes 
to the beneficiaries (heirs). The beneficiaries are required to pay a gift tax on the value of 
the assets placed in the GRAT. However, the IRS taxes GRAT gifts only according to their 
discounted present value because the heirs did not receive use of the property while it was 
in trust. The primary disadvantage of using a GRAT in estate planning is that if the grantor 
dies during the life of the GRAT, its assets pass back into the grantor’s estate. These assets
then become subject to the full estate tax. A GRAT is an excellent tool for transferring the 
appreciation of an asset such as a growing company to heirs with few tax implications.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, founder 
of Facebook, and seven other major shareholders in the company recently created GRATs 
that will save an estimated $240 million in estate taxes in the future. By setting up a GRAT with
3.4 million pre-IPO shares of Facebook stock valued at just $1.85 per share, Zuckerberg alone will
avoid nearly $68 million in estate taxes (at current estate tax rates).138 ■
Establishing a trust requires meeting many specific legal requirements and is not something 
business owners should do on their own. It is much better to work with experienced attorneys, 
accountants, and financial advisers to create them. Although the cost of establishing a trust can 
be high, the tax savings they generate are well worth the expense.
ESTATE FREEZE An estate freeze minimizes estate taxes by having family members create two 
classes of stock for the business: (1) preferred voting stock for the parents and (2) nonvoting 
common stock for the children. The value of the preferred stock is frozen, whereas the common
stock reflects the anticipated increased market value of the business. Any appreciation in the
value of the business after the transfer is not subject to estate taxes. However, the parent must pay 
gift taxes on the value of the common stock given to the children. The value of the common stock 
is the total value of the business less the value of the voting preferred stock retained by the parent. 
The parents also must accept taxable dividends at the market rate on the preferred stock they own.
FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP Creating a family limited partnership (FLP) allows business-
owning parents to transfer their company to their children and lower their estate taxes while 
still retaining control over it for themselves. To create an FLP, the parents (or parent) set up 
a partnership among themselves and their children. The parents retain the general partnership 
interest, which can be as low as 1 percent, and the children become the limited partners. As 
general partners, the parents control both the limited partnership and the family business. In other 
words, nothing in the way the company operates has to change. Over time, the parents transfer 
company stock into the limited partnership, ultimately passing ownership of the company to their 
children.

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
One of the principal tax benefits of an FLP is that it allows discounts on the value of the 
shares of company stock the parents transfer into the limited partnership. Because a family busi-
ness is closely held, shares of ownership in it, especially minority shares, are not as marketable 
as those of a publicly held company. As a result, company shares transferred into the limited part-
nership are discounted at 20 to 50 percent of their full market value, producing a large tax savings 
for everyone involved. The average discount is 40 percent, but that amount varies, depending on 
the industry and the individual company involved.
Because of their ability to reduce estate and gift taxes, FLPs have become one of the 
most popular estate planning tools in recent years. The following tips will help entrepreneurs 
establish an FLP that will withstand legal challenges:
● Establish a legitimate business reason other than avoiding estate taxes—such as transfer-
ring a business over time to the next generation of family members—for creating the FLP 
and document it in writing.
● Make sure that all members of the FLP make contributions and take distributions according to 
a predetermined schedule. Owners should not allow FLP funds to pay for personal expenses 
nor should they time partnership distributions with owners’ personal needs for cash.139
● Do not allow members to put all of their personal assets (such as a house, automobiles, 
or personal property) into the FLP. Commingling personal and business assets in an FLP 
raises a red flag to the IRS.
● Expect an audit of the FLP. The IRS tends to scrutinize FLPs, so be prepared for a thor-
ough audit.140
Developing a succession plan and preparing a successor require a wide variety of skills, 
some of which the business founder will not have. That’s why it is important to bring experts into 
the process when necessary. Entrepreneurs often call on their attorneys, accountants, insurance 
agents, and financial planners to help them build a succession plan that works best for their par-
ticular situations. Because the issues involved can be highly complex and charged with emotion,
bringing in trusted advisers to help improves the quality of the process and provides an objective 
perspective.
Exit Strategies
Most family business founders want their companies to stay within their families, but in some 
cases, maintaining family control is not practical. Sometimes, no one in the next generation of 
family members has an interest in managing the company or has the necessary skills and experi-
ence to handle the job. Under these circumstances, the founder must look outside the family for 
leadership if the company is to survive. Whatever the case, entrepreneurs must confront their 
mortality and plan for the future of their companies. Having a solid management succession
plan in place well before retirement is near is absolutely critical to success. Entrepreneurs should 
examine their options once they decide it is time to step down from the businesses they have
founded. Entrepreneurs who are planning to retire often use two strategies: sell to outsiders or 
sell to (nonfamily) insiders. We turn now to these two exit strategies.
Selling to Outsiders
As you learned in Chapter 6, selling a business to an outsider is no simple task. Done properly,
it takes time, patience, and preparation to locate a suitable buyer, strike a deal, and make the 
transition. Advance preparation, maintaining accurate financial records, and timing are the keys 
to a successful sale. Too often, however, business owners, like some famous athletes, stay with 
the game too long until they and their businesses are well past their prime. A “fire-sale” approach 
rarely yields the maximum value for a business.
A straight sale may be best for those entrepreneurs who want to step down and turn the reins 
of the company over to someone else. However, selling a business outright is not an attractive

exit strategy for those who want to stay on with the company or for those who want to surrender 
control of the company gradually rather than all at once.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Michael and Joseph Orseno: CVM Companies After 
investing more than 25 years leading CVM Companies, a maker of industrial fans in Carol
Stream, Illinois, brothers Michael and Joseph Orseno, both members of the Baby Boom genera-
tion, grew tired of their 70-hour workweeks and decided to sell their business. Although the 
brothers had children, none were interested in taking the reins of CVM Companies. Within weeks 
of putting the company up for sale, the Orsenos provided information about their business to 
70 potential buyers before receiving four offers, one of which they accepted. ■
Selling to Insiders
When entrepreneurs have no family members to whom they can transfer ownership or who want 
to assume the responsibilities of running a company, selling the business to employees is often 
the preferred option. In most situations, the options available to owners are a leveraged buyout 
and an employee stock ownership plan.
LEVERAGED BUYOUTS In a leveraged buyout (LBO), managers and/or employees borrow money 
from a financial institution and pay the owner the total agreed-on price at closing; then they use the 
cash generated from the company’s operations to pay off the debt. The drawback of this technique is 
that it creates a highly leveraged business. Because of the high levels of debt they take on, the new 
management has very little room for error. Too many management mistakes or a slowing economy 
has led many highly leveraged businesses into bankruptcy.
If properly structured, LBOs can be attractive to both buyers and sellers. Because they get 
their money up front, sellers do not incur the risk of loss if the buyers cannot keep the business 
operating successfully. The managers and employees who buy the company have a strong incen-
tive to make sure the business succeeds because they own a piece of the action and some of their 
capital is at risk in the business. The result can be a highly motivated workforce that works hard 
and makes sure that the company operates efficiently.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS Unlike LBOs, employee stock ownership plans 
(ESOPs) allow employees and/or managers (i.e., the future owners) to purchase the business 
gradually, freeing up enough cash to finance the venture’s future growth. With an ESOP, 
employees contribute a portion of their salaries and wages over time toward purchasing shares of 
the company’s stock from the founder until they own the company outright. In leveraged ESOPs, 
the ESOP borrows the money to buy the owner’s stock either all at once or over time. Then, using 
employees’ contributions, the ESOP repays the loan over time (with pre-tax dollars), using the 
shares of the company’s stock as collateral for the loan. An advantage of a leveraged ESOP is 
that the principal and the interest the ESOP borrows to buy the business are tax deductible, which
can save thousands or even millions of dollars in taxes. Transferring ownership to employees
through an ESOP is a long-term exit strategy that benefits everyone involved. The owner sells the 
business to the people he or she can trust the most, his or her managers and employees, and the 
managers and employees buy a business they already know how to run successfully. In addition, 
because they own the company, the managers and employees have a huge incentive to see that 
it operates effectively and efficiently. One study of employee stock ownership plans in privately 
held companies found that the ESOPs increased sales, employment, and sales per employee by 
2.4 percent a year.141 Approximately 10,900 ESOPs operate in U.S. companies, and they involve 
10.3 million employee owners. In half of the companies, the ESOP controls a majority of the 
ownership.142
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFILE: Tom Hirons: Hirons & Company Tom Hirons, who in
1978 founded the advertising and public relations firm that bears his name, created an 
ESOP through which he will transfer ownership to his 29 employees over several years. At 61, 
Hirons did not want to sell the company, based in Indianapolis, Indiana, to outsiders. The ESOP 
allows him to gradually make the transition out of his business and put it into the hands of the 
people who contributed so much over time to make it successful.143 ■

SECTION IV • PUTTING THE BUSINESS PLAN TO WORK: SOURCES OF FUNDS
Chapter Summary by Learning Objective
1. Explain the challenges involved in the 
entrepreneur’s role as leader and what it takes 
to be a successful leader.
● Leadership is the process of influencing and inspiring 
others to work to achieve a common goal and then 
giving them the power and the freedom to achieve it.
● Management and leadership are not the same, yet both 
are essential to a small company’s success. Leadership
without management is unbridled; management with-
out leadership is uninspired. Leadership gets a small
business going; management keeps it going.
2. Describe the importance of hiring the right 
employees and how to avoid making hiring 
mistakes.
● The decision to hire a new employee is an important 
one for every business, but its impact is magnified
many times in a small company. Every new hire 
a business owner makes determines the heights to 
which the company can climb—or the depths to 
which it will plunge.
● To avoid making hiring mistakes, entrepreneurs 
should develop meaningful job descriptions and 
job specifications, plan and conduct an effective 
interview, and check references before hiring any 
employee.
3. Explain how to create a company culture that 
encourages employee retention.
● Company culture is the distinctive, unwritten code
of conduct that governs the behavior, attitudes, rela-
tionships, and style of an organization. Culture arises
from an entrepreneur’s consistent and relentless 
pursuit of a set of core values that everyone in the 
company can believe in. Small companies’ flexible 
structures can be a major competitive weapon.
● Job design techniques for enhancing employee 
motivation include job enlargement, job rotation, 
job enrichment, flextime, job sharing, and flexplace 
(which includes telecommuting).
● Money is an important motivator for many workers 
but not the only one. The key to using rewards such as 
recognition and praise to motivate involves tailoring
them to the needs and characteristics of the workers.
4. Describe the steps in developing a 
management succession plan for a growing 
business that allows a smooth transition of 
leadership to the next generation.
● As their companies grow, entrepreneurs must 
begin to plan for passing the leadership baton to 
the next generation well in advance. A succession
plan is a crucial element in successfully transfer-
ring a company to the next generation. Preparing 
a succession plan involves five steps: (1) select the
successor, (2) create a survival kit for the successor, 
(3) groom the successor, (4) promote an environ-
ment of trust and respect, and (5) cope with the 
financial realities of estate taxes.
5. Explain the exit strategies available to 
entrepreneurs.
● Family business owners wanting to step down from
their companies can sell to outsiders or to insiders. 
Common tools for selling to insiders (employees or 
managers) include LBOs and ESOPs.
Discussion Questions
16-1. What are servant leaders? 
16-2. What behaviors do effective leaders exhibit?
16-3. Why is it so important for small companies to hire 
the right employees? What can small business own-
ers do to avoid making hiring mistakes?
16-4. Identify the guidelines to help entrepreneurs become 
employers of choice and hire winners.
16-5. What are the most common causes of a company’s 
poor hiring decisions?
16-6. What is company culture? What role does culture 
play in a small company’s success? What threats
does rapid growth pose for a company’s culture?
16-7. Some entrepreneurs have migrated to creative recruiting 
in order to support their growing businesses. Provide
some examples of these offbeat recruiting techniques.
16-8. Why is there a need to conduct a background check 
on potential candidates?
16-9. Job enrichment involves building motivators into a 
job by increasing the functions that employees per-
form. Identify the five core characteristics used to 
enrich employees’ jobs.
16-10. Employees who are fully engaged in their work 
take pride in making valuable contributions to the 
organization’s success. They derive personal satis-
faction from doing so. How can entrepreneurs help 
to improve employee engagement?
16-11. Entrepreneurs should examine their options once 
they decide it is time to step down. What are the 
options available to an entrepreneur who plans 
to retire?

CHAPTER 16 • BUILDING A NEW VENTURE TEAM AND PLANNING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
667
Beyond the Classroom . . .
16-12. Visit a local business that has experienced rapid
growth in the past three years and ask the owner 
about the specific problems he or she had to face 
because of the organization’s growth. How did the 
owner handle these problems? Looking back, what 
would he or she do differently?
16-13. Visit a business outlet within your campus vicinity.
Interview the manager and ask about his or her hiring 
process. Has the manager ever made a hiring mis-
take? How did the problem get rectified? Is there a 
job description for every position in the organization? 
16-14. Ask the owner of a small manufacturing operation to 
give you a tour of his or her operation. During your 
tour, observe the way jobs are organized. To what 
extent does the company use the job design concepts
of job simplification, job enlargement, job rotation, 
job enrichment, flextime, and job sharing? Based on 
your observations, what recommendations would you 
make to the owner about the company’s job design?
16-15. Find Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” or 
Inc.’s “Top Small Company Workplaces” issue. Read
the profiles of the companies included on the list and 
develop a list of at least five ideas you would like to
incorporate into the company you plan to launch.
16-16. Contact five small business owners about their 
plans for passing their businesses on to the next 
generation. Do they intend to pass the business
along to a family member? Do they have a manage-
ment succession plan? When do they plan to name 
a successor? Have they developed a plan for mini-
mizing the effects of estate taxes? How many more 
years do they plan to work before retiring?
16-17. Entrepreneurs say they have learned much about 
leadership from the movies! “Films beg to be 
interpreted and discussed,” says one leadership 
consultant, “and from those discussions business-
people come up with principles for their own jobs.” 
A recent survey of small company CEOs by Inc. 
magazine* resulted in the following list of the best 
movies for leadership lessons: Apollo 13 (1995), 
The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Dead Poets
Society (1989), Elizabeth (1998), Glengarry Glen 
Ross (1992), It’s a Wonderful Life (1946), Norma 
Rae (1979), One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest
(1975), Twelve Angry Men (1957), and Twelve
O’Clock High (1949). Rent one of these films and 
watch it with a group of your classmates. After 
viewing the movie, discuss the leadership lessons 
you learned from it and report the results to the 
other members of your class.

Leadership, I Learned from the Movies,” Inc., March 2000, pp. 58–70.

in this strategy is that competitors could establish a foothold
in a community before the arrival of TDP, causing a poten-
tial drain on revenues and a dramatic increase in advertis-
ing expenditures to maintain market share. Knowing these 
risks—and planning for them—gives TDP the edge needed 
to make the exit strategy viable.
By year 3, we estimate a net worth of $1,075,969, a cash 
balance of $773,623, and earnings of $860,428, based on 
13 drive-throughs and four Mobile Cafés. At that point, a 
market value of between $3.5 million and $8.6 million for 
the company is reasonable. At present, coffee chains are 
trading in multiples of 4 to 10 times earnings. Using the
midpoint of that range (7) provides an estimated value of 
$6 million by the end of year 3.
The figure on page 670 summarizes the forecasts for 
TDP’s sales, gross profit, and net income for the first three 
years of operation.
1.1 Objectives
The Daily Perc has established three objectives it plans to
achieve in the next three years:
1. Thirteen drive-through locations and four fully booked 
Mobile Cafés by the end of the third year
2. Gross profit margin of 45 percent or more
3. Net after-tax profit above 15 percent of sales
1.2 Mission
The Daily Perc’s mission is threefold, with each being as
integral to our success as the next.
● Product mission. Provide customers the finest quality 
beverages in the most efficient way
● Community mission. Support the local communities in 
which we operate
● Economic mission. Operate and grow at a profitable 
rate by making sound business decisions
1.3 Keys to Success
There are four keys to success in this business, three of which
are virtually the same as in any food service business. It is
the fourth key—the Community Mission—that gives TDP
the extra measure of respect in the public eye.
1. The best locations, characterized by highly visible,
high traffic counts, and convenient access
2. The best products, featuring the freshest coffee beans, 
cleanest equipment, premium serving containers, and 
most consistent flavor
3. The friendliest servers who are well trained, cheerful, 
skilled, professional, and articulate
4. The finest reputation that generates word-of-mouth 
advertising and promotes our community mission and 
charitable giving
1.0 Executive Summary
The Daily Perc (TDP) is a specialty beverage retailer. TDP 
uses a system that is new to the beverage and food service
industry to provide hot and cold beverages conveniently 
and efficiently. TDP provides its customers the ability to 
drive up and order (from a trained Barista) their choice of a
custom-blended espresso drink, freshly brewed coffee, or 
other beverage. TDP offers a high-quality alternative to fast-
food, convenience store, or institutional coffee.
The Daily Perc offers its patrons the finest hot and cold 
beverages, specializing in specialty coffees, blended teas,
and other custom drinks. In addition, TDP will offer soft 
drinks, fresh-baked pastries, and other confections. Season-
ally, TDP will add beverages such as hot apple cider, hot 
chocolate, frozen coffees, and more.
The Daily Perc will focus on two markets:
The daily commuter. Someone who is traveling to or 
from work, shopping, delivering goods or services, or 
just out for a drive.
The captive consumer. Someone who is in a restricted 
environment that does not allow convenient departure 
and return for refreshments or where refreshments 
stands are an integral part of the environment.
The Daily Perc will penetrate the commuter and captive 
consumer markets by deploying drive-through facilities and 
Mobile Cafés in highly visible, accessible locations. The 
drive-through facilities are designed to handle two-sided 
traffic and dispense customer-designed, specially ordered 
cups of premium coffee in less time than is required for a 
visit to a locally owned café or one of the national chains.
In addition to providing a quality product and an 
extensive menu of delicious items, we will donate up to
7.5 percent of revenue to local charities to increase customer 
awareness of and loyalty to our business and to generate 
good publicity coverage and media support.
The Daily Perc’s customer service process is labor in-
tensive, and TDP recognizes that a higher level of talent is 
essential to success. The financial investment in its employ-
ees will be one of the greatest differentiators between TDP 
and its competition. For the purpose of this plan, the capital 
expenditures of facilities and equipment are financed. We 
will maintain minimum levels of inventory on hand to keep 
our products fresh and to take advantage of price decreases 
when they should occur.
The Daily Perc anticipates an initial combination of in-
vestments and short- and long-term financing of $365,670 
to cover start-up costs. This will require TDP to grow more 
slowly than might be otherwise possible, but our growth will 
be solid, financially sound, and tied to customer demand.
The Daily Perc’s goal is to become the drive-through 
version of Starbucks between the mountains, eventually ob-
taining several million dollars through a private offering that 
will allow the company to open 20 to 30 facilities per year 
in metropolitan communities in the North, Midwest, and 
South with populations of more than 150,000. The danger

2.0 Company Summary
The Daily Perc is a specialty beverage retailer. TDP uses a 
system that is new to the beverage and food service indus-
try to provide hot and cold beverages conveniently and effi-
ciently. TDP provides its customers the ability to drive up and 
order from a trained Barista their choice of a custom-blended 
espresso drink, freshly brewed coffee, or other beverage. 
TDP offers a high-quality alternative to fast-food, conve-
nience store, and institutional coffee.
2.1 Company Ownership
The Daily Perc is a limited liability company. All member-
ship shares are currently owned by Bart and Teresa Fisher, 
who intend to use a portion of the shares to raise capital.
The plan calls for the sale of 100 membership units in 
the company to family members, friends, and private (angel) 
investors. Each membership unit in the company is priced 
at $4,250, with a minimum of five units per membership 
certificate, or a minimum investment of $21,250 per investor.
When TDP completes its financing, Bart and Terri Fisher 
will maintain ownership of 51 percent of the company.
2.2 Start-Up Summary
The Daily Perc’s start-up expenses and funding are shown in 
the following tables and charts. The majority of these funds 
will be used to build the first facility, pay deposits, and provide 
capital for six months of operating expenses, initial inventory, 
and other one-time expenses. The Daily Perc also will need 
operating capital for the first few months of operation.

drive-through in the Colonial Square Shopping Center will 
serve as the commissary for the first mobile unit.
The demographic and physical requirements for a drive-
through location are the following:
● Traffic of 40,000+ cars per day on store side
● Visible from roadway
● Easy entry, preferably with a traffic light
● Established retail shops in area
The founders identified TDP’s first location with the help of 
MapInfo’s Spectrum Location Intelligence Module, a map-
ping and geographic analysis software package that enables
users to visualize the relationships between demographic 
and traffic count data and geography to produce maps that 
show the best locations for businesses. We will use this soft-
ware to choose the company’s future locations in the met-
ropolitan area. As TDP expands into other cities, managers 
will supplement the insight that MapInfo provides with the 
tools in ZoomProspector, another useful location analysis 
tool, to identify the cities that are most likely to be home to 
other successful TDP locations.
3.0 Products
The Daily Perc provides its patrons the finest hot and cold 
beverages, specializing in specialty coffees and custom-
blended teas. In addition, TDP will offer select domestic soft 
drinks, Italian sodas, fresh-baked pastries, and other confec-
tions. Seasonally, TDP will add beverages such as hot apple 
cider, hot chocolate, frozen coffees, and more.
3.1 Product Description
The Daily Perc provides its customers, whether at a drive-
through facility or at one of the Mobile Cafés, the ability to 
custom-order a beverage that will be blended to their exact 
specifications. Each of TDP’s Baristas will be trained in 
the fine art of brewing, blending, and serving the highest-
quality hot and cold beverages with exceptional attention 
to detail.
Besides its selection of coffees, TDP will offer teas, do-
mestic and Italian sodas, frozen coffee beverages, seasonal
specialty drinks, pastries, and other baked goods. Through 
the Web site and certain locations, TDP will market pre-
mium items bearing the TDP logo, such as coffee mugs, 
T-shirts, sweatshirts, caps, and more.
3.2 Competitive Comparison
The Daily Perc considers itself to be a player in the retail 
coffeehouse industry. However, we understand that competi-
tion for its products range from soft drinks to milk shakes to
adult beverages.

We will locate 12 more drive-through facilities through-
out the metropolitan area over the next three years. The 
APPENDIX • THE DAILY PERC BUSINESS PLAN
671

The Daily Perc’s primary desire will be to listen to its 
customers to ascertain which products they want and to pro-
vide them.
4.0 Market Analysis Summary
The Daily Perc will focus on two markets:
1. The daily commuter. Someone traveling to or from 
work, out shopping, delivering goods or services, or 
just out for a drive
2. The captive consumer. Someone who is in a re-
stricted environment that does not allow convenient 
departure and return while searching for refreshments 
or where refreshment stands are an integral part of the 
environment
4.1 Market Segmentation
The Daily Perc will focus on two different market segments: 
commuters and captive consumers. To access both of these
markets, TDP has two different delivery systems. For the 
commuters, TDP offers the drive-through coffeehouse. For 
the captive consumer, TDP offers the Mobile Café.
Commuters are defined as anyone in a motorized ve-
hicle traveling “from point A to point B.” The Daily Perc’s 
principal focus will be on attracting commuters heading to
or from work and those on their lunch breaks.
Captive consumers include those who are tethered to 
a campus environment or to a restricted-entry environment 
where people’s schedules afford limited time to make pur-
chases. Examples include high school and college campuses, 
where students have limited time between classes, and corpo-
rate campuses, where the same time constraints are involved.
The following table and pie chart reflect the number of 
venues available for the Mobile Cafés and the growth we 
expect in those markets over the next five years. For an es-
timate of the number of Captive Consumers, we multiplied
the total number of venues by 1,000. For example, in year 1, 
we estimate that there are 2,582 venues at which we might 
position a Mobile Café. That would equate to a captive con-
sumer potential of 2,582,000 people.
Similarly, there are more than 2,500,000 commuters in 
the metropolitan area as well as visitors, vacationers, and 
others. Some of these commuters make not just one bever-
age purchase a day but, in many cases, two and even three 
beverage purchases.
The chart also reflects college and high school campuses, 
special events, hospital campuses, and various charitable or-
ganizations. A segment that the chart does not show (because
it would skew the chart greatly) is the number of corporate 
campuses in the metropolitan area. There are more than 
1,700 corporate facilities that employ more than 500 people, 
giving us an additional 1,700,000 potential customers, or a to-
tal of 2,582 locations at which we could place a Mobile Café.
The Daily Perc’s primary competition will come from 
three sources:
1. National coffeehouses, such as Starbucks and Panera
2. Locally owned and operated cafés
3. Fast-food chains and convenience stores
Two things make TDP stand out from all its competitors: 
The Daily Perc will provide products in the most con-
venient and efficient way, either at one of the two-sided 
drive-through shops or at one of the Mobile Cafés. This 
separates TDP from the competition in that its customers 
won’t have to find parking places, wait in a long lines, 
jockey for seats, and clean up the mess left by previous
patrons. The Daily Perc’s customers can drive or walk 
up, order their beverages, receive and pay for them and 
quickly be on their way.
The second differentiator is TDP’s focus on providing 
a significant benefit to the community through a 7.5 percent 
contribution to customer-identified charities, schools, or 
other institutions.
3.3 Sourcing
The Daily Perc purchases its coffees from PJ’s Coffee. It 
also has wholesale purchasing agreements for other prod-
ucts with Major Brands, Coca-Cola, Big Train, Al’s Famous 
Filled Bagels, L&N Products, and Royal Distribution.
The drive-through facilities are manufactured by City 
Stations, and the Mobile Cafés are manufactured by Tow 
Tech Industries.
Fulfillment equipment suppliers include PJ’s Coffee, 
City Stations, Talbert Ford, and Retail Image Programs. The 
Daily Perc’s computer equipment and Internet connectivity 
are provided by NSI Communications.
3.4 Technology
The Daily Perc’s delivery system uses state-of-the-art, two-
sided drive-through facilities to provide convenience and ef-f
ficiency for its clientele. An architectural exterior diagram of 
the drive-through building can be found in the appendix (not 
included in this sample plan).
The Daily Perc also has designed state-of-the-art 
Mobile Cafés that will be deployed on high school and col-
lege campuses, on corporate campuses, and at special events.
3.5 Future Products
The Daily Perc will offer products that reflect the chang-
ing seasons and customers’ changing demand for bever-
ages. During the warm summer months, TDP will offset 
lower hot beverage sales with frozen coffee drinks as well 
as soft drinks and other cold beverages. The Daily Perc 
will also have special beverages during holiday seasons,
such as eggnog during the Christmas season and hot apple
cider in the fall.

APPENDIX • THE DAILY PERC BUSINESS PLAN

4.2.1 MARKET TRENDS Nearly 20 years ago, a trend toward 
more unique coffees began to develop in the United States. 
There had always been specialty coffee stores, such as Gloria
Jeans and others, but people began to buy espresso machines 
for their homes and offices. Coffee tastings in stores became 
popular, and later espresso bars began to appear. Then along 
came Starbucks, the quintessential bastion of upwardly 
mobile professionals who wanted to take control over how 
their beverages were made.
Since Starbucks arrived on the scene, people have be-
come more pressed for time. The same customers who
helped push Starbucks’s sales to nearly $10 billion are now 
rushing to get their kids to soccer practice and basketball 
games, running to the grocery store, and trying to get to 
work on time and back home in time for dinner—or to get 
to the next soccer game. Yet they still have the desire for that 
refreshing, specially blended coffee each morning.
4.2 Target Market Segment Strategy
The Daily Perc’s target market is the mobile customer who 
has more money than time and excellent taste in the choice
of a beverage but no desire to linger in a café. By locating the 
drive-throughs in high-traffic/high-visibility areas, these cus-
tomers will patronize TDP and become our regular guests.
Our Mobile Cafés will allow TDP to take the café to 
the customer! By using the community support program that 
TDP is instituting, we will make arrangements to visit high 
schools, college campuses, or corporate campuses once or 
twice a month. (We also will offer to visit these facilities for 
special games, tournaments, recruiting events, or corporate 
open houses.) We will return a portion of the revenue from 
each beverage or baked goods sold to the high school or col-
lege, allowing the institution to reap a financial reward while 
providing a pleasant and fulfilling benefit to their students 
or employees.

4.3 Industry Analysis
Consumers in the United States drink 450 million cups of 
coffee per day and spend $40 billion a year on coffee-based
r
drinks. The coffee industry in the United States has grown 
rapidly in the United States over the last five years. Sales of 
specialty coffees are growing at a rate of 20 percent per year. 
Even general coffee sales have increased, with international 
brands such as Folgers, Maxwell House, and Safari coffee 
reporting higher sales and greater profits. The United States 
is the leading coffee-consuming nation in the world, and the 
coffee industry is reaping the rewards.
4.3.1 DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS The café experience comes 
from the Italian origins of espresso. The customer enters a 
beautifully decorated facility surrounded by wondrous aromas 
and finds himself or herself involved in a sensory experience 
that, more often than not, masks an average product at a 
premium price. However, the proliferation of cafés in the United 
States proves the viability of the market. It is a duplication of 
the same delivery process as currently exists in Europe.
4.3.2 COMPETITION AND BUYING PATTERNS There are four 
general competitors in TDP’s drive-through market. They
are the national specialty beverage chains, such as Starbucks
and Panera; local coffeehouses—or cafés with an established 
clientele and a quality product; fast-food restaurants; and 
convenience stores. There is a dramatic distinction among 
the patrons of each of these outlets.
Patrons of Starbucks or of one of the local cafés are 
looking for the “experience” of the coffeehouse. They want 
the ability to “design” a custom coffee, smell fresh pastries, 
listen to soothing Italian music, and read a newspaper or visit 
with a friend. It is a relaxing, slow-paced environment.
Patrons of fast-food restaurants or convenience stores 
expect just the opposite. They have no time for idle chatter 
and are willing to overpay for whatever beverage the ma-
chine spits out—as long as it’s quick. They pay for their gas 
and are back on the road to work. Although they have ability 
to differentiate between a good cup of coffee and a bad one,
time is more valuable to them than quality.
Competitors of the Mobile Cafés on campuses include
fast-food restaurants (assuming that they are close enough so 
that customers can get there and back in the minimal allotted 
time), vending machines, and company or school cafeterias. 
The customers in this environment are looking for a quick, 
convenient, fairly priced, quality beverage that allows them 
to purchase the product and return to work, class, or other 
activity.
Competitors of the Mobile Cafés at events such as festi-
vals and fairs include all the other vendors who are licensed 
to sell refreshments. Attendees of these events expect to pay
a premium price for a quality product.
4.3.3 MAIN COMPETITORS The Daily Perc has no direct 
competitors in the drive-through segment of the market in 
the metropolitan area. The Daily Perc will be the first double-
sided, drive-through coffeehouse in the city. However, we 
Recently, we have seen the introduction of beverage 
dispensers at convenience stores that spit out overly sweet,
poorly blended cappuccinos in flavors such as French vanilla 
or mocha, and consumers are paying as much as $3.00 for 
these substandard beverages.
The market is primed for the introduction of a company
that offers a superior quality, specially blended product in 
a convenient, drive-through environment at a price that is 
competitive with national coffeehouses.
The Daily Perc is a member of the National Coffee As-
sociation and the National Specialty Coffee Association. 
These two trade associations provide useful information on 
the relevant trends in the industry, information for making 
comparisons to other companies on financial performance, 
and educational workshops and seminars.
4.2.2 MARKET GROWTH The 183 million Americans who 
drink coffee consume 146 billion cups of coffee per year. In 
addition, more than 173 million people in the United States 
drink tea. According to industry statistics, the consumption 
of coffee and flavored coffee products is growing rapidly, 
and 34 percent of coffee drinkers go to “premium” coffee 
outlets to purchase their beverages.
The segment of the market we are targeting is the 
commuter, and the number of people who commute to
work is increasing by about 6 percent per year. In the
metropolitan area, as with many metropolitan areas in 
the country, there is a migration away from the cities as 
people choose to live in quiet suburban areas and drive to 
work in the city.
The United States is home to 128.3 million commut-
ers. Using census data, we estimate that more than 2.5 mil-
lion commuters drive to and from work each day in our 
defined market. In addition, research shows that 54 percent 
of Americans drink coffee every day and that the typical cof-f
fee drinker consumes three nine-ounce cups of coffee per 
day. Nearly 65 percent of coffee consumption takes place in
the morning, 30 percent occurs between meals, and 5 per-
cent occurs between meals. Therefore, TDP has a significant 
daily target for its beverages, particularly during the morn-
ing drive time.
4.2.3 MARKET NEEDS The United States is a very mobile 
society. With the introduction of the automobile, we became a 
nation that thrived on the freedom of going where we wanted
when we wanted. The population of the United States is 
315 million people, and there are more licensed vehicles in
the country than there are people. The population’s mobility
has created a unique need in our society for products 
available “on the go.”
Our market is made up of consumers who have busy
schedules, a desire for quality, and adequate disposable in-
come. As much as they would like the opportunity to sit in an 
upscale coffeehouse and sip a uniquely blended coffee bev-
erage and read the morning paper, they don’t have the time. 
However, they still have the desire for a uniquely blended 
beverage as they hurry through their busy lives.

APPENDIX • THE DAILY PERC BUSINESS PLAN

with similar depth to that of TDP is Quikava, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Chock Full ‘o Nuts. However, Quikava 
has limited its corporate footprint to the East Coast and the 
Great Lakes region.
In the drive-through specialty beverage market, TDP 
has a competitive edge over these competitors, including 
Quikava, because of the following:
● Mobile Cafés
● Consistent menu
● Community benefit
● Quality product
● Supply discounts
● Valued image
● Greater product selection
Fast-Food and Convenience Stores: Most national fast food
chains and national convenience store chains already serve 
coffee, soda, and some breakfast foods. The national fast-
food chains understand the benefits and value that drive-
through service provides customers; 70 percent of the typical 
fast-food outlet’s sales come from drive-through customers. 
In addition, nearly 80 percent of the growth in the fast-food 
industry in the last five years has come through outlets’ drive-
through windows. Customers who buy coffee at fast-food and 
convenience stores shop primarily on the basis of price rather 
than quality and, therefore, are not TDP’s primary target 
customers. The Daily Perc’s advantage is that the quality of 
the products it sells is much higher than those sold at fast-
food and convenience stores. Soft-drink sales for the typical 
quick-serve store account for a large portion of beverage 
sales. The Daily Perc believes that the quality of its products 
and the convenience of speedy drive-through service give it a 
competitive edge over fast-food and convenience stores.
Other Competition: The Daily Perc understands that once it 
has entered the market and established a presence, others will 
try to follow. However, TDP believes that although imitators 
will appear, they cannot duplicate its corporate mission, 
organizational design, or customer value proposition. The 
Daily Perc will constantly evaluate its products, locations,
service, and mission to ensure that it remains a leader in the 
specialty beverage industry in its market segment.
4.3.4 INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS There is only one national 
drive-through coffee franchise operation in the United States
that poses a threat: a subsidiary of Chock Full ‘o Nuts called
Quikava. Quikava operates primarily on the East Coast and in 
the upper Great Lakes region. The East and West coasts and 
even some Mountain and Midwest states have smaller local
drive-through chains such as Caffino, Java Espress, Crane 
Coffee, Java Drive, Sunrise Coffee, and Caffe Diva. However, 
other players in the premium coffee service industry include 
Starbucks, Gloria Jean’s, Caribou Coffee, Panera Bread, and 
locally owned and operated coffee shops or “cafés.”
face significant competition from indirect competitors in the
form of traditional coffeehouses, convenience stores, fast-
food outlets, and other retailers.
National Chains: In 2013, Starbucks, the national leader,
operated more than 11,400 retail outlets in the United States
(and nearly 8,400 foreign outlets) that generated operating
revenue of $14.9 billion, which represents an increase of 
12  percent over 2012. The average annual revenue for a 
Starbucks outlet is $754,000, or $89,558 in revenue per 
employee.
Panera Bread had revenues of $2.11 billion, an increase
of 12.2 percent over 2012. Annual sales at the average Panera 
Bread outlet are $2.5 million. Coffee beverages are not the 
primary focus of Panera Bread’s menu.
Despite its name, Dunkin’ Donuts’s primary emphasis
is on selling coffee. The company has more than 11,000 out-
lets worldwide, 7,000 of which are in the United States. Con-
structing a Dunkin’ Donuts retail store costs about $500,000, 
and average sales at a Dunkin’ Donuts outlet in the United 
States are $845,000. The company’s stronghold on market 
share is greatest in the Northeast, where it originated.
The Daily Perc believes it has a significant competi-
tive advantage over these chains because of the following 
benefits:
● Drive-through service
● Superior customer service
● Community benefit
● Mobile Cafés
● Greater selection
● Higher product quality
Local Cafés: The toughest competitor for TDP is the 
established locally owned café. The Daily Perc knows the 
quality and pride that the local café has in the products their 
customers purchase. Local cafés typically benefit from their 
loyal, highly educated customers. The quality of beverages
served at an established café surpasses those of the regional 
or national chains.
The competitive edge TDP has over local cafés is based 
on the following:
● Drive-through service
● Supply discounts
● Mobile Café
● Consistent menu
● Community benefit
● Quality product
Drive-Through Coffeehouses: There are no drive-through 
specialty beverage retailers with a significant market 
presence in the central United States. The only company

3. Demonstrated how TDP appreciates their loyalty and 
patronage by donating money to a meaningful cause
5.2 Value Proposition
The drive-through facilities provide a substantial value 
proposition because our customers do not have to find park-
ing places, exit their vehicles, stand in long lines to order, 
pay premium prices for average products, find places to sit, 
clean up the previous patron’s mess, and then enjoy their 
coffee—assuming that they have sufficient time to linger 
over the cup.
The Daily Perc’s concept is that the customer drives up, 
places an order that is filled quickly and accurately, receives 
a high-quality product at a competitive price, and drives 
away, having invested little time in the process.
The Daily Perc is also providing a significant commu-
nity value on behalf of customers who patronize TDP. For 
every purchase a customer makes from us, TDP will donate 
up to 7.5 percent of each sale to a local charity selected by 
our customers.
5.3 Competitive Edge
The Daily Perc’s competitive edge is simple. TDP provides a
high-quality product at a competitive price in a drive-through 
environment that saves customers valuable time.
5.4 Marketing Strategy
The Daily Perc will be placing its drive-through facilities 
in highly visible, easily accessible locations. They will be
located on high-traffic commuter routes and near shopping 
centers and concentrations of complementary retail shops 
to catch customers who are traveling to or from work, go-
ing out for lunch, or venturing on a shopping expedition. 
The drive-throughs’ design is very unique and eye-catching, 
which will be a branding feature of its own.
As the following chart indicates, TDP’s target audience 
skews older.
5.0 Strategy and 
Implementation Summary
The Daily Perc will penetrate the commuter and captive 
consumer markets by deploying drive-through facilities and 
Mobile Cafés in highly visible, high-volume, accessible lo-
cations. The drive-throughs are designed to handle two-sided 
traffic and dispense customer-designed, specially ordered 
cups of specialty beverages in less time than required for a 
visit to the locally owned café or one of the national chains.
The Daily Perc has identified its market as busy, mobile
people whose time is already at a premium but who desire a 
refreshing, high-quality beverage or baked item while com-
muting to or from work or school.
In addition to providing a quality product and an exten-
sive menu of delicious side items, TDP pledges to donate up
to 7.5 percent of revenue from each cup sold in individual 
drive-throughs to the charities that its customers choose.
5.1 Strategy Pyramid
The Daily Perc’s strategy is to offer customers quality prod-
ucts, convenient accessibility, and a community benefit. To 
execute this strategy, TDP is placing the drive-throughs and 
Mobile Cafés in well-researched, easily accessible locations 
throughout the metropolitan area. The Daily Perc is pric-
ing its product competitively and training the production 
staff to be among the best Baristas in the country. Prices for 
TDP’s products are at or slightly below the national average. 
Through coupons and display ads at its locations, TDP will 
involve customers in community support efforts by donating 
a portion of each sale to a charity of their choosing.
In so doing, TDP has accomplished the following:
1. Provided a customer with a quality product at a com-
petitive price
2. Provided customers with a more convenient method for 
obtaining their desired products

5.4.2 DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY The Daily Perc will locate its 
drive-through facilities in high-traffic areas of the city where 
it knows working commuters will be passing. Our first outlet 
will be located at the corner of Main Street and Broughton 
Road, which has a traffic count of 42,200 cars per day.
The Daily Perc will also make arrangements for the Mo-
bile Cafés to be at as many schools, businesses, and events
as possible every year to promote TDP to new customers.
5.4.3 MARKETING PROGRAMS
Distinctive Logo: Our logo, “Papo,” is a very happy and
conspicuous sun. The sun touches every human being every 
day, and TDP wants to touch its customers every day. Papo is
already an award-winning logo, having won the “New Artist 
Category” of the 2013 Not Just Another Art Director’s Club
(NJAADC).
Distinctive Buildings: The Daily Perc is using diner-style 
buildings for its drive-through facilities and has worked 
closely with the manufacturer to make the building distinctive
so that it is easy to recognize and functional.
The Mobile Café: The Mobile Café will be a key marketing
tool for TDP. The similarities between the Mobile Cafés
and the drive-through facilities will be unmistakable. The 
exposure that these units provide is difficult to measure 
directly but is extremely important to the company’s growth. 
The Daily Perc will negotiate visits for its mobile units at 
schools, hospitals, companies, and special events. A portion 
of all sales made while at these locations will go to a nonprofit 
entity of the organization’s choice. The organization will 
promote its presence to its constituency and encourage 
them to frequent TDP’s drive-through establishments to 
support their charitable cause. This will give those patrons 
an opportunity to taste the products and become regular 
customers of the drive-through facilities. The Mobile Cafés 
will also appear at community events, such as fairs, festivals,
and other charitable events.
Advertising and Promotion: In the first year, TDP plans 
to spend moderately on advertising and promotion, with 
the program beginning in June, prior to the opening of the 
first drive-through. This would not be considered a serious 
advertising budget for any business, but TDP believes that 
the exposure will come from publicity and promotion, so we 
will spend most of the funds on a good publicist who will get 
the word out about the charitable contribution program and 
how it works in conjunction with the Web site. The Daily 
Perc also believes that word-of-mouth advertising and free 
beverage coupons will be better ways to drive people to the 
first and second locations.
In the second year, TDP will increase the budget be-
cause it will need to promote several locations, with particu-
lar emphasis on announcing these openings and all the other 
locations. The Daily Perc will continue to use publicity as
a key component of the marketing program because TDP 
could be contributing more than $70,000 to local schools
and charities.
Therefore, TDP will implement a low-cost advertising 
campaign that includes traditional advertising media, such 
as drive-time radio and a few strategically located outdoor 
ads. However, because a significant portion of our target 
customers is younger than 40, we also will use social media 
tools extensively.
The Daily Perc will rely on building relationships 
with schools, charities, and companies to provide signifi-
cant free publicity through its community support program. 
When TDP makes charitable contributions to these institu-
tions, they will get the word out to their students/faculty/
employees/partners about TDP. Word-of-mouth advertising 
has long been one of the greatest advertising techniques a 
company can use. In addition, we will encourage the media
to cover the charitable aspects of TDP, giving the company
the opportunity for more exposure every time TDP writes a 
check to a nonprofit organization.
The Daily Perc will use social media marketing tools 
such as Twitter and Facebook as well, particularly to pro-
mote the locations of its Mobile Cafés. We will send tweets
to our followers to alert them to the location of our Mobile 
Cafés. We also will post the Mobile Cafés’ locations on 
Facebook.
5.4.1 PROMOTION STRATEGY The long-range goal is to gain
enough visibility to expand the TDP brand into other regions
and generate inquiries from potential inventors. To do that, 
TDP must employ the following:
● A public relations service at $1,000 per month for the 
next year to generate awareness of TDP among news-
papers, magazines, bloggers, and reviews. We antici-
pate that the school fund-raising program will generate 
a publicity on its own and eventually will minimize—
or even eliminate—the need for a publicist.
● Advertising expenditures of $1,000 per month focused 
on drive-time radio and strategically selected bill-
boards. The Daily Perc will experiment with different 
stations, keeping careful track of results. We will select 
billboards that are near our existing locations to serve 
as reminders of our locations for passing motorists. As 
with the school fund-raising program, TDP expects its 
storefronts and signage to be a substantial portion of 
our advertising.
● A social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and 
YouTube. We can use these tools to reach our target 
customers at very little expense. We will promote daily 
specials on selected items on Facebook and Twitter and 
will post videos of our Best Barista Contest on You-
Tube. We also plan to involve our customers through 
a contest that offers free coffee for one year to the 
customer who posts the best YouTube video promoting 
TDP. We also will sponsor a “Fan of the Day” contest 
by randomly drawing one person who likes TDP on 
Facebook to receive a free cup of coffee and announc-
ing the winner on Facebook and on Twitter.
APPENDIX • THE DAILY PERC BUSINESS PLAN
677

5.5.1 SALES FORECAST In the first year, TDP anticipates 
having two drive-through locations in operation. The first 
location will open on July 15. The second drive-through will 
open six months later. The Daily Perc is building in a few
weeks of “ramp-up” time for each facility while commuters 
become familiar with its presence. The drive-throughs will
generate 288,000 checks in the first year of operation.
In the second year, TDP will add two more drive-
throughs, and in the third year, TDP will add an additional 
nine drive-through facilities. The addition of these facilities 
will increase the revenue from drive-throughs with a to-
tal of more than 1,000,000 checks in the second year and 
2,675,000 checks in the third.
In addition to the drive-throughs, TDP will deploy one 
mobile unit in the fourth quarter of the first fiscal year and 
expects this mobile unit to generate 10,000 checks at an av-
erage check of $2.45 (including baked goods).
In the second quarter of the second fiscal year, TDP will 
deploy its second and third mobile units and expects all three
mobile units to generate a total of 150,000 checks in the sec-
ond year. In the third fiscal year, with the addition of a fourth 
mobile unit, TDP expects to generate 264,000 mobile unit 
checks.
The Daily Perc also will generate revenue from the sale 
of “The Daily Perc” T-shirts, sweatshirts, insulated coffee 
mugs, prepackaged coffee beans, and other items. The Daily 
Perc is not expecting this to be a significant profit center, but 
it is an integral part of the marketing plan and an important 
part of developing our brand and building product aware-
ness. The Daily Perc expects revenues from this portion, 
which will begin in the second fiscal year, to reach as much 
as $3,000 per month in the third fiscal year.
We forecast total first year unit sales will reach
298,402 cups. The second year will see unit sales increase
to 1,177,400 cups. The third year, with the addition of a sig-
nificant number of outlets, we will see unit sales increase 
to 2,992,000 cups.
In the third year, TDP will double its advertising and 
promotion budget, with the majority of the advertising bud-
get being spent on drive-time radio to reach our commuting
target audience. As in the previous years, TDP will get sub-
stantial publicity from the donation of nearly $200,000 to 
local schools and charities.
5.4.4 PRICING STRATEGY The national average price for a 
cup of brewed coffee is $1.38, and the average price of an 
espresso-based drink is $2.45. The Daily Perc’s pricing will 
be slightly below those of the national chain coffeehouses but 
very similar to those of local cafés to reflect the value-added 
feature of immediate, drive-through service and convenience. 
Costs to make a 6-ounce cup of coffee are as follows:
Coffee
$0.25
Cup, lid, and sleeve
0.22
Milk
0.21
Total
$0.68
Additional ingredients add anywhere from $0.02 (sugar) 
to $1.08 (mocha syrup) to the cost of a single 6-ounce cup of 
coffee for a total cost that ranges from $0.70 for a basic cup 
of premium coffee to $1.76 for a café mocha.
5.5 Sales Strategy
We will rely on several in-store sales strategies, including 
posting specials on high-profit items at the drive-up win-
dow. The Daily Perc also will use a customer loyalty pro-
gram that awards a free cup of coffee to customers who have 
accumulated the required number of points by purchasing 
12 cups of coffee. Customers also can earn points by tell-
ing others about their purchases at TDP on Facebook, Twit-
ter, and other social media sites. The Daily Perc will also 
develop window cross-selling techniques, such as the
Baristas asking whether customers would like a fresh-baked 
item with their coffee.

Corporate Tasting Events. The Daily Perc plans to 
host at least one tasting event for customers each quarter. In 
addition, TDP will adjust its menu to reflect the changing 
seasons in the flavors it served.
Drink Coupons. At fund-raising events for schools and 
corporate events, we will give away drink coupons as door 
prizes or awards. These giveaways are inexpensive and en-
courage new customers to come in to claim a free beverage 
and bring a friend or buy a baked item or a package of our 
premium coffee. The drive-through units will also distribute 
coupons for special menu items or new product introductions.
Chamber of Commerce and Professional Member-
ships. Because of the need to promote its drive-through lo-
cations and its Mobile Café services, TDP will be an active 
member in the regional and local chambers of commerce, 
food service associations, and two national coffee asso-
ciations. The exposure and education that these organiza-
tions provide is outstanding, but equally important are the 
contacts and opportunities made available for deploying a 
Mobile Café—or even two—at a special event.
5.6 Milestones
The Milestone table reflects critical dates for occupying 
headquarters, launching the first drive-through and sub-
sequent drive-throughs as well as deploying the mobile 
units. The Daily Perc also defines our break-even month, 
our Web site launch and subsequent visitor interaction 
function, and other key markers that will help us measure 
our success.

d

of Jones International, Inc., for the last four years. Jones is 
a $4 million company that retails vitamins and other nutri-
tional products. During her four years with Jones Interna-
tional, Mary has written numerous corporate policies and
directed the financial reporting.
Mr. Tony Guy will perform the duties of corporate 
events coordinator on a part-time basis. Tony has more than 
five years of experience in business-to-business sales. Last 
year he sold more than $250,000 in sales of promotional ma-
terial to corporate and educational clients.
Mr. Chuck McNulty will fill the position of warehouse/
trailer manager. Chuck has been working for Nabisco, Inc., 
as a service representative for more than 10 years; before 
that, he was involved in inventory control for a Nabisco 
factory. His experience in account services, merchandis-
ing, and inventory control is a welcome addition to the 
TDP team. Chuck will use his knowledge to establish in-
ventory and warehouse policies. The warehouse manager 
is responsible for the inventory of all products sold by 
TDP. In addition, knowledge of regulations and health re-
quirements are important. Chuck will be responsible for 
ensuring that TDP maintains proper levels of inventory. He 
will work closely with the mobile and drive-through Baris-
tas to make sure that all of the products they sell are fresh, 
appetizing, and available in the appropriate quantities at 
the right time.
6.0 Management Summary
The Daily Perc will maintain a relatively flat organization. 
Overhead for management will be kept to a minimum, and 
all senior managers will be “hands-on” workers. We have 
no intention of creating a top-heavy organization that drains 
profits and complicates decision making.
At the end of year 3, TDP will have four executive po-
sitions: chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief 
information officer, and director of marketing. There will
be other midmanagement positions, such as district manag-
ers for every four drive-throughs and a facilities manager to
oversee the maintenance and stocking of the Mobile Cafés 
and the equipment in the drive-through facilities.
6.1 Management Team
The Daily Perc has selected Mr. Barton Fisher to perform the 
duties of chief operating officer. Bart has an entrepreneurial
spirit and has already started a company (NetCom Services, 
Inc.) that was profitable within three months of start-up and 
paid off all of its initial debt within six months. Bart’s ex-
perience, leadership, and focus and three years of research 
in specialty drinks and drive-through service make him the 
ideal chief operating officer for TDP.
Ms. Mary Jamison will fill the position of bookkeeper 
and office manager. Mary has been the business administrator

none of which will be in operation for the entire year. The
total head count for the first year, including management, 
administrative support, and customer service (production) 
employees, is 15. The payroll expenditures are shown in the 
following table.
In the second year, with the addition of two drive-
throughs and two mobile units, TDP will add customer ser-
vice personnel, its first district manager, and some additional 
support staff at headquarters, including an inventory clerk, 
equipment technician, and administrative support staff. The 
head count will increase by nearly 100 percent in the second
year to 29, causing a significant increase in payroll expense.
In the third year, we will see the most dramatic growth 
in head count—180 percent over year 2—because of the ad-
dition of nine drive-throughs and another mobile unit. Total 
payroll for the third year will reflect this increase as well as
the significant increase in the senior management team with 
the addition of a chief financial officer, a chief information
officer, and a director of marketing. The Daily Perc also will
add two more district managers and a corporate events sales 
executive. Total personnel will reach 81.
The chief financial officer will be brought in to man-
age the growing company’s finances. The chief information 
officer will be responsible for the expansion of our exist-
ing point-of-sale computerized cash register system that will
make tracking and managing receipts, inventory control, and 
charitable contributions more robust. Ideally, this person
will have both point-of-sale and inventory control experi-
ence that will allow him or her to provide real-time sales and 
inventory control information for accurate decision making 
at every level in the company. In addition, the chief infor-
mation officer should begin building the foundation for an 
Internet-based information system that will support franchi-
sees in the future.
The director of marketing will be charged with manag-
ing the relationships with advertising agencies, public rela-
tions firms, the media; keeping the TDP Web site current; and 
coordinating the company’s social media marketing efforts.
6.2 Management Team Gaps
The Daily Perc will require several additional management team 
members over the next three years. We will hire one district 
manager for every four drive-throughs. These district manag-
ers will oversee the quality of the products sold, the training of 
the Baristas, inventory management, and customer satisfaction.
Eventually, the goal is to promote from within, particularly from 
our Mobile Café and drive-through teams, for these positions.
By the beginning of the third year, TDP will have hired 
three key senior managers: a chief financial officer, a chief 
information officer, and a director of marketing. We will dis-
cuss the roles of each of these managers in subsequent sec-
tions of this plan.
6.3 Organizational Structure
The organization will be relatively flat; most of TDP’s em-
ployees are involved in production, and our goal is to maintain 
a small core of qualified managers who empower employees 
to make decisions that are in our customers’ best interest.
There are three functioning groups within the company: 
production, sales and marketing, and general and adminis-
trative. For purposes of this plan—and to show the details of 
adding senior-level management—TDP has broken manage-
ment down as a separate segment, but it is an integral part of 
the general and administrative function.
Production involves the Baristas, or customer service
specialists, who will be staffing the drive-throughs and Mo-
bile Cafés and blending the beverages for the customers. 
The sales and marketing staff will coordinate the promotion 
and scheduling of the Mobile Cafés as well as the promo-
tion of the drive-throughs and the Community Contribution 
program. General and administrative personnel will manage 
the facilities, equipment, inventory, payroll, and other basic, 
operational processes for the company.
6.4 Personnel Plan
The Daily Perc forecasts its first year to be rather lean be-
cause we will have only two locations and one mobile unit,

7.2 Key Financial Indicators
The following chart shows changes in key financial indica-
tors: sales, gross margin, operating expenses, and inventory
turnover. The expected growth in sales exceeds 250 percent 
each year. The Daily Perc forecasts its gross profit margin 
in year 1 to be 40 percent; by year 3, we expect it to reach 
45 percent.
Projections for inventory turnover show that TDP 
will maintain a relatively stable amount of inventory in its 
warehouse so that it has no less than one week of inventory
on hand but no more than two weeks of inventory so that 
products stay fresh. The only time we will consider holding 
larger stores of inventory is if there is some catastrophic 
event that would cause shortages in the supplies of its
coffees or teas.
7.0 Financial Plan
Although we forecast a loss of about $29,000 for TDP in 
its first year of operation, the company’s long-term financial 
picture is quite promising. Because TDP is a cash business,
its cash requirements are significantly less than other com-
panies that must carry extensive amounts of accounts receiv-
able. However, because our process is labor intensive, TDP 
recognizes that we must hire employees with more talent. 
The financial investment in our employees will be one of the 
greatest differentiators between TDP and its competitors. In 
this plan, we assume that we are financing the cost of our 
facilities and equipment. These items are capital expendi-
tures and will be available for financing. We will maintain a 
minimum of inventory to ensure the freshness of our coffee 
products and baked goods and to take advantage of price de-
creases when and if they occur.
The Daily Perc forecasts that the initial combination of 
investments and long-term financing will be sufficient with-
out the need for any additional equity or debt investment 
other than the purchase of additional equipment and facili-
ties as it grows. This strategy will require TDP to grow more 
slowly than might be otherwise possible, but the company’s 
expansion will be solid, financially sound growth based on 
its success in meeting customers’ needs.
7.1 Important Assumptions
The following table shows the underlying assumptions used 
to build the financial forecasts for TDP:
● A slow-growth economy but no major recession.

7.3 Break-Even Analysis
Assuming average revenue per unit of $1.87 and fixed oper-
ating costs of $19,457 per month, TDP estimates its break-
even point to be $29,580 per month. This is the equivalent of 
selling 15,817 cups of coffee per month, or 527 cups per day.

7.4 Projected Profit and Loss
The Daily Perc is expecting dramatic growth in the next 
three years, reaching strong sales and a healthy gross profit 
margin by the end of its first year of operation. Expenses 
during the first year will, however, produce a net loss of 
about $29,000.
Aside from production costs of 60 percent, which in-
clude actual purchases of products and commissions for 
sales efforts, the single largest expenditures in the first year 
are in the general and administrative (G&A) area, which to-
tal 23 percent of sales. G&A includes expenses for rents, 
equipment leases, utilities, and payroll for all employees.
Sales increase by nearly 400 percent in the second year 
because of the addition of two more drive-throughs and two 
more Mobile Cafés. Although operating expenses double
in the second year, TDP forecasts a net profit of $217,000, 
which represents a net profit margin (net income ÷ sales)
of 9.24 percent. In that same year, TDP will make substan-
tial charitable contributions in the communities in which it 
operates.
The third year is when TDP has the opportunity to 
break into markets outside the metropolitan area. The Daily 
Perc will open nine additional drive-through facilities in the 
third year, which will increase sales faster than production 
costs, which improve the company’s gross profit margin. 
Several expenses increase substantially in year 3, including 
advertising, charitable donations, and payroll (because TDP 
will add several key management team members). Once 
again, the company’s two largest expenses are production 
costs and G&A expenses. However, the G&A expenses de-
crease from 23 percent of sales in year 1 to 18.5 percent of 
sales in year 2 and 15.0 percent of sales in year 3. By year 3, 
operating efficiencies push the company’s net profit margin 
to 16 percent.

With sufficient initial financing, TDP anticipates no 
cash flow shortfalls for the first year or beyond. In year 1,
the months of March and May produce the greatest cash 
drains because TDP will incur the cost of adding second 
drive-through and a second mobile unit. In addition, TDP 
experiences heavier-than-normal cash disbursements in 
December and January because accounts payable come 
due then.
7.5 Projected Cash Flow
As in any business, managers must manage cash extremely
carefully; however, TDP has the benefit of operating a cash 
business. Forecasts show that the business generates positive 
cash flow, even in year 1. The greatest challenge that TDP 
faces in managing cash flow results from the seasonal dips
in coffee sales during warm weather, but TDP will attempt 
to offset those declines by adding seasonal menu items, such
as iced cappuccinos, iced mochas, and others.

expects to build a company with strong profit potential and 
a solid balance sheet that will be asset heavy and flush with
cash at the end of the third year. The Daily Perc has no plan 
to pay dividends before the end of the third year; instead, 
the company will use the cash it generates to fuel its growth.
7.6 Projected Balance Sheet
The Daily Perc’s projected balance sheet shows a significant 
increase in net worth in year 2, at which point the company 
will generate an impressive 90.5 percent return on invest-
ment (ROI). As the financial projections indicate, TDP

d

enter high-potential markets with copycat concepts before 
TDP can expand into those markets, resulting in lower 
revenues and a dramatic increase in advertising expenditures 
to maintain market share. Understanding these risks—and 
planning for them—gives TDP the edge required to make 
this scenario work.
Scenario 3: By the third year, the growth and community 
support for TDP is creating a buzz in cities beyond the
metropolitan area. Competitors such as Starbucks or 
Quikava will realize the value proposition that TDP offers 
its customers and identify the company an attractive target 
for buyout.
Taking a conservative approach to valuation, we es-
timate that TDP would be valued at $7.5 million. Assum-
ing that all 250 units of ownership in TDP are distributed 
to investors, a cash purchase of TDP would net each unit 
$30,000. With each unit selling at $4,250, that price consti-
tutes an ROI of 705 percent over the three years. However,
any buyout will most likely involve a cash/stock combina-
tion, which is preferable because tax consequences of the 
transaction for the sellers would be more favorable than in 
an all-cash deal.
7.7 Exit Strategy
There are three scenarios for the investors and managers to
recover their investment, two of which produce significant 
returns on each dollar invested.
Scenario 1: The Daily Perc becomes extremely successful
and begins selling franchises. When one considers the wealth 
that successful franchisers such as McDonald’s, Wendy’s, 
Five Guys Burgers and Fries, and others have created, the
potential to franchise a well-run system is considerable.
However, developing a franchise can be extremely costly, 
takes years to build, and can be diminished by a few 
franchisees who fail to deliver the consistency or value on 
which the founding company has built its reputation.
Scenario 2: The Daily Perc becomes the drive-through 
version of Starbucks, obtaining several million dollars 
through a private offering that allows the company to open 
20 to 30 outlets per year in the region of the country between 
the mountain ranges in both metropolitan and micropolitan 
communities. This is the preferred exit strategy of the 
management team. The danger with this exit strategy is that 
once TDP becomes successful, competitors will attempt to

Case 1
Panda Sunglasses
How Should a Start-Up Business with
a Social Mission Market Its Sunglasses 
with Bamboo Frames?
Vincent Ko showed his entrepreneurial potential in high 
school in Rockville, Maryland, when, as a young hockey 
player, he invented a drying rack for hockey pads that he sold 
to his teammates, then on eBay, and finally on a Web site for 
the company he created. A few years later, while attending 
George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Ko and 
two friends, Luke Lagera and Mike Mills, were inspired by 
the growing social entrepreneurship movement and the suc-
cess of companies such as TOMS shoes, a company founded 
by Blake Mycoskie that donates a pair of shoes to some-
one in need for every pair it sells. One day while walking 
through the Georgetown shopping district, the friends no-
ticed a display of sunglasses and decided to create a business
that would market cool sunglasses and provide eye examina-
tions to someone in need for every pair sold. In keeping with 
the idea of a socially responsible company, Ko suggested
that they make their sunglasses frames from eco-friendly 
bamboo, a lightweight, sturdy wood that grows extremely 
fast. Having grown up in China, Ko was familiar with the 
properties of the renewable wood and knew that it was the
perfect material from which to make sunglasses frames.
They created a company, Panda Sunglasses, and set out 
to find companies that could make the product they envi-
sioned. Ko knew bamboo was the most commonly used wood
in China, so the team began looking for a company in China 
to manufacture the frames to their specifications. Not only 
did they find a Chinese wood shop that would make their 
sunglasses frames, but they also located a Chinese eye wear 
manufacturer to produce the polarized lenses. Pairing the two 
companies gave them their unique, stylish sunglasses, which
float. They created a Web site and began selling them at $120 
a pair. Through a connection that Lagera had, the young
entrepreneurs found an ideal partner in the Tribal Outreach
Medical Association (TOMA), a nonprofit organization that 
provides eye examinations and other health services for tribal 
communities. They quickly reached a deal: For every pair of 
Panda Sunglasses sold, the company would pay for one eye 
exam through TOMA.
The entrepreneurs’ next challenge was to market their 
unique sunglasses and their potential to help people in need. 
They knew that without sales, their effort at “conscious capi-
talism” would be for naught. None of the three cofounders
had any experience in the retail industry, but they learned 
quickly on the job. The young men had just graduated and 
took “regular” jobs to pay their bills, but they remained 
dedicated to making Panda Sunglasses a success. After test-
ing sales of their sunglasses online, the trio began applying for 
spots in various trade shows geared toward accessories. One 
of the shows they applied to was the prestigious ENK Inter-
national trade show, which attracts more than 250,000 buyers 
and press members from across the globe. Companies that are 
accepted to the juried show find sales leads that generate total 
sales of more than $1 billion. Mills sent Ko an e-mail in which 
he joked that they would be willing to set up in a broom closet 
at ENK if their application were accepted. Ko forwarded that 
e-mail to executives at ENK, who responded with, “We’ll find 
you a booth instead.” At the ENK show, Ko says he and his
cofounders, fresh out of college, created a booth that featured
a giant bamboo backdrop that attracted a great deal of atten-
tion. At one point, they struck up a conversation with three 
women, who they learned were buyers from the retail chain
Nordstrom. The trade show opened many doors for the young
company, and less than two years after starting, Panda Sun-
glasses was generating annual sales of $350,000.
Questions
1. How can social entrepreneurs such as the founders of 
Panda Sunglasses use their companies’ social missions
to attract customers and promote their businesses?
2. How should the founders of Panda Sunglasses define 
a unique selling proposition for their company that 
resonates with customers?
3. Write a brief memo to the founders of Panda 
Sunglasses outlining a bootstrap marketing plan
for the company.
4. Use the business model canvas to illustrate Panda Sun-
glasses’s business model. Can you identify other revenue
streams that could support the company? How can the
company strengthen its relationships with customers?
5. How should the founders of Panda Sunglasses use
social media to market their company and its products? 
What can they do to increase the traffic to and generate
more sales from their company’s Web site?

Case 2
Oxitec
Should a Company Be Able to Release 
Genetically-Altered Mosquitoes into 
the Environment?
Oxitec, a British biotech company founded by Dr. Luke 
Alphey, develops innovative approaches for insect-borne dis-
eases and agricultural pests plaguing developing countries.
Oxitec developed a new approach to tackling the 
mosquito-borne disease dengue fever. There are 50 million 
to 100 million cases of dengue fever every year, with a death 
rate of about 2.5 percent. There is no treatment or vaccine 
for dengue fever; patients are treated for their symptoms and
the disease must run its course. Many pests are becoming
resistant to insecticides, and concerns are growing over the 
long-term environmental and health impact of consistent use 
of insecticides. Using advanced genetics, Oxitec breeds and 
releases “sterile” male mosquitos of the disease-carrying 
species. The company claims that this new approach is a
highly targeted form of biological control that is safe to other 
species, causes no lasting impact on the environment, and is 
cost-effective. In 2010, Oxitec released 3 million genetically 
altered mosquitos into the Cayman Islands, resulting in a re-
ported 80 percent reduction in the incidence of dengue fever.
In 2009 the Florida Keys suffered an outbreak of dengue 
fever. Although no one died from the outbreak, 93 people 
became ill in Key West. To avoid future outbreaks, the Florida 
Keys Mosquito Control District decided to contract with 
Oxitec to release its genetically altered mosquitos in the 
Florida Keys. Key West would be only the fourth location 
worldwide to use this approach to control the local mosquito 
population.
Some critics raised concerns about releasing genetically 
altered mosquitos into the environment. Others questioned 
the ecological impact of removing insects from an ecosys-
tem. These critics argued that no one knows the impact on 
animals that feed on these mosquitos and cannot know what 
other organisms may move in to fill the ecological void once 
the mosquitos are gone. The Florida Keys Environmental 
Coalition wrote to Florida Governor Rick Scott, asking him 
to stop Oxitec, pointing out that “. . . biting female mosqui-
toes could inject an engineered protein into humans along 
with other proteins from the mosquitos’ salivary gland. 
Oxitec has yet to conduct or publish any study showing
that this protein is not expressed in the salivary gland and 
therefore cannot be passed on to humans.”
A local real estate agent collected more than 117,000 sig-
natures on a petition she posted on Change.org against the re-
lease of the genetically-altered mosquitos in the Florida Keys.
Advocates of the plan pointed to the research conducted 
by Oxitec that has been published in peer-reviewed scien-
tific journals, which highlights the problems associated with 
traditional spraying with insecticides. The use of the altered 
mosquitos cannot move ahead until the FDA gives its formal 
approval.
Local residents also are concerned about the ecologi-
cal impact of Oxitec’s approach to insect control. They ar-
gue that officials should take a wait-and-see approach by 
observing the ecological impact of the treatment used in the 
Cayman Islands.
Questions
1. Is it ethical for a company to expose people to prod-
ucts that have not been definitively proven to be safe? 
Explain.
2. Is it ethical for community leaders to put citizens at 
risk for a deadly disease, such as dengue fever, when 
there is a proven approach to reducing the impact of 
the disease? Explain.
3. How should companies test the safety of products
before they are introduced? Explain.
4. Create a detailed diagram of all of the stakeholders 
of Oxitec. How is each of the stakeholders affected by 
Oxitec’s actions? Explain. What conclusions can you 
draw from this analysis?
5. Describe the business model of Oxitec using the 
Business Model Canvas. What recommendations 
might you make for the company’s business model
going forward?

Case 3
Source Outdoor
Should a Small Company’s Business 
Model Include a Channel of Distribution 
That Competes with Its Retail Customers?
Entrepreneurs never know when a business idea will come
to them. Gerald Shvartsman came up with the idea for his 
wicker and outdoor furniture business, Source Outdoor, in
2009 when he went shopping at several Miami, Florida, 
stores for outdoor furniture for the balcony of his apartment. 
Shocked by the high prices of couches, wicker chairs, and 
chaise lounges, Shvartsman decided to open a business that 
imported low-cost, high-end outdoor furniture. He found a
low-cost supplier in China and placed an order. When the 
four containers arrived, Shvartsman unloaded them him-
self and then switched roles, becoming his company’s one-
man sales force and calling on every furniture store within 
a 60-mile radius. Within a few months, every store that he 
had visited had some of Source Outdoor’s furniture in their 
showrooms or were selling from his company’s catalog.
To expand his company’s reach, Shvartsman began sell-
ing through local interior designers and decorators and to ho-
tel and condominium owners at discounts of 50 percent of the 
normal retail price. After working with one online furniture
retailer, he began filling orders (by drop shipping) for other 
online retailers. Like the brick-and-mortar retail stores he
supplied, Shvartsman offered online furniture retailers dis-
counts of 60 percent off retail prices. In addition, six or seven 
times each year, Shvartsman would haul a truckload of his 
overstocked merchandise and sell it directly to the public at a 
large Florida home show. Most of the sales to the public were 
at full retail price, generating impressive profit margins of 
more than 300 percent. By 2011, Source Outdoor’s sales had 
reached $4.4 million; in 2013, they doubled to $9 million.
As Source Outdoor’s sales volume increased, Shvartsman 
began to notice that his manufacturer in China was shipping 
aluminum chairs and tables that had flaws, such as discol-
ored metal coatings, mismatched fabrics on cushions, and
weak metal supports. Because he had built his company on
the premise of selling high-end, quality furniture at moder-
ate prices, he knew that the quality problems could threaten 
Source Outdoor’s reputation and success. Shvartsman decided 
that the best way to address the quality problems with his
supplier was to manufacture those items himself. He cleared 
out a section of the company’s warehouse, purchased $60,000 
worth of equipment, including metal lathes for forming
curved table legs and other parts, welding torches, grind-
ers, and an oven for warming vinyl. Soon Source Outdoor 
was making much of the same furniture in his converted 
Miami warehouse that he had been importing from China but 
the quality of the products was much higher. In addition, 
Shvartsman could now fill orders much faster (shipments 
from China took months to arrive) and could offer custom-
designed finishes and cushions, a feature that was appealing
to many of his interior designers, decorators, and retail furni-
ture store customers. Although Shvartsman wants to expand 
the percentage of his company’s products made in-house, he 
realizes that he will have to continue to import items that are 
labor-intensive, such as handcrafted woven wicker furniture,
from China and other countries with low labor costs.
One day, Shvartsman received a call from one of his 
best retail customers who complained about Source Outdoor 
selling directly to customers at the Florida home show. The 
store owner said Source Outdoor was taking potential sales 
from his store and all of the other nearby stores to which 
Shvartsman sold. He realized that similar calls from other 
retail customers were likely to come and began weighing his
options. The home show sales were important to his com-
pany and generated impressive profit margins. So far, he had 
encountered none of the retail stores he supplied at the home 
show. Shvartsman was able to move slow-selling merchan-
dise at attractive margins, but was doing so worth alienat-
ing his primary customer base, the retail furniture stores that 
carried his company’s products?
Questions
1. Is Shvartsman’s entrepreneurial story typical of the 
way that other entrepreneurs come up with the ideas 
for their businesses? Explain.
2. Use the business model canvas to illustrate Shvartsman’s
business model. Do you notice any areas that require 
strengthening?
3. What advantages and disadvantages did Shvartsman
encounter by “reshoring” some of his company’s 
manufacturing?

CASE 3 • SOURCE OUTDOOR

4. Should Source Outdoor consider exporting its prod-
ucts? If so, what steps should Shvartsman take to 
develop an export strategy?
5. Refer to the “Channels,” “Customer Segments,” and 
“Revenue Streams” segments of the business model
canvas that you created in question 2. Do you see any
potential conflicts?
6. Write a one-page memo to Gerald Shvartsman explain-
ing how you recommend that he resolve the issue that 
the retail store owner raised over Source Outdoor’s 
direct sales to customers at the Florida home show.

Case 4
Father and Son Pizzeria
Should the Owner of a Pizzeria Remodel 
and Expand, Move to a New Location, or 
Focus on Selling the Restaurant’s Popular 
Red Sauce Through Retail Outlets?
When Carlos Vega was in high school, he worked part-time 
at a small pizza shop, Father and Son Pizzeria, in Guttenberg, 
New Jersey, where he learned the value of hard work. As a 
young man, Vega demonstrated entrepreneurial tendencies, 
operating a disc jockey business on weekends, launching an 
Internet dating service (that he sold), and flipping houses. 
After graduating from Montclair State University with a de-
gree in business administration, Vega went to work in his 
family’s printing business for several years before taking jobs 
with KPMG and Thomson Financial, where he managed the 
company’s printing operations.
Many years later, Vega stopped by Father and Son Pizzeria 
to buy a pizza and began talking with his former boss, who still 
operated the business but wanted to retire. The founder’s son 
had no interest in taking over the business, and the founder 
confided to Vega that he did not want to sell the business to 
just anyone. Before he knew it, Vega bought the tiny pizzeria, 
which was housed in just 900 square feet of space and had 
room for only eight tables. Vega immediately expanded the 
menu to include a broad range of Italian dishes and a line of 
desserts, began accepting Internet orders, added credit card
sales, and introduced “take-and-bake” pizzas that customers 
could pick up and bake at home. He also tweaked the recipe for 
the pizzeria’s red sauce, known by the locals as “gravy,” that he 
had learned to make as a teenager working there.
One problem facing Vega was that Father and Son
Pizzeria had no liquor license. Acquiring one would cost 
$250,000, and Vega doubted that, with just eight tables, sell-
ing alcohol would generate enough revenue to offset the cost 
of the license. Nearby competitors not only had liquor li-
censes but also operated from larger buildings and had their 
own parking lots, which allowed them to generate more 
sales. However, the biggest problem the small pizzeria faced 
was more difficult to solve: no parking lot and a location in 
a densely populated six-block central business district where 
parking spaces were scarce. It was as if the little business
were caught in a small three-square-mile trap. Vega was
making the best of the location, however, and the small res-
taurant was generating a profit, albeit a meager one.
Vega spotted another business opportunity as grow-
ing numbers of customers asked to purchase the classic red 
sauce that he used on his pizzas. He began making 40 quarts 
a week that sold out quickly. Then he began making 120 or 
more quarts a week to satisfy customer demand. Profit mar-
gins on the quarts of sauce, which he sold at $8.99 per jar,
were higher than those on the items on the pizzeria’s menu.
Vega faced an important decision in the life of his busi-
ness. He could expand his pizzeria by adding a second story
at the current location, move to a larger building down the
block that had room for more tables, or turn his focus to 
selling jars of his red pizza sauce, which he was market-
ing on the side as Jersey Italian Gravy. If he chose to focus 
on selling his sauce, he knew that he would have to learn a 
new set of skills concerning food manufacturing, packaging, 
and shipping. He also knew that the pizza sauce market is 
crowded, highly price-sensitive, and dominated by several 
large brands. His local market tests showed that customers
would buy his Italian gravy, but would that translate into 
profitable sales across a larger geographic area where the
tiny business had no name recognition? In addition, would 
he be able to get the product onto the shelves of enough 
stores to make a difference?
Questions
1. Analyze the advantages and the disadvantages of each 
of the three options that Carlos Vega has identified.
2. Based on your analysis in question 1, write a short 
memo to Vega explaining which of the three options 
he should pursue and why.
3. Suppose that Vega chooses to relocate his business.
Should he expand his analysis of potential sites beyond 
the central business district of Guttenberg? What crite-
ria should he establish for screening potential sites?
4. Suppose that Vega chooses to focus on selling his red
sauce. Work with a team of your classmates to brain-
storm ideas for a unique selling proposition (USP) 
that Vega could use to market the sauce effectively.
5. If Vega focuses on marketing his red sauce, what steps
should he take to protect the Jersey Italian Gravy brand 
name he has been using?

Case 5
Jimmy Beans Wool
Can an Online Yarn Retailer Get 
Its Groove Back?
In 2002, Laura Zander, a former software engineer, decided 
to turn her recently acquired knitting hobby into a business. 
She and her husband, Doug, who also has a background in 
technology, invested $30,000 of their own money to open 
a 500-square-foot knitting store, Jimmy Beans Wool, in 
Truckee, California, a small town of 14,000 people near the
Lake Tahoe resort area. To expand the reach of their busi-
ness, the Zanders built a Web site and used social media and
instructional videos to drive traffic to the company’s Web 
site. As evidenced by Jimmy Beans Wool’s tag line, “Your 
local yarn store—online,” Laura’s strategy was to offer 
the same personalized customer service that she offered in 
the store online. She wrote newsletters to keep customers
up to date on trends, fashions, and techniques and created 
1,100 free instructional videos made in a simple, friendly, 
homespun style that resonated with her target customers. 
The videos are posted on YouTube and on the company’s 
Web site. Internet sales soon made up 98 percent of the 
company’s total sales. As the company grew, Laura added a 
customer service line that customers could call to have their 
questions answered by a friendly, well-trained employee.
By 2005, Jimmy Beans Wool had grown so much 
that Doug quit his technology job and began working for 
the business full-time. By 2007, annual sales had reached 
$1 million and in 2013, sales had grown to $7 million. Con-
sultants told the Zanders that Jimmy Beans Wool could 
become a $100 million business, and that became the co-
preneurs’ goal. They decided to add fabric to their product 
line, investing $150,000 in inventory, with the anticipation 
that fabric sales would double the company’s revenue within 
three to five years. The Zanders also decided to create a flag-
ship retail store in Reno, Nevada. The 20,000-square-foot 
store housed the company’s offices, warehouse, and retail 
space. Laura began to move out of her day-to-day role in
the business, leaving those tasks to the company’s rapidly 
growing staff, to become the “face” of Jimmy Beans Wool
and its spokesperson. The Zanders also embarked on several
rather costly marketing initiatives, including partnerships
with the United States Ski and Snowboard Association and 
the National Institutes of Health. They also doubled the size
of the company’s marketing staff to eight and hired a chief 
technology officer to allow Doug to focus more on expand-
ing the company.
The Zanders were confident that the changes they had
implemented would increase sales. However, the company’s 
sales growth evaporated, and then sales began to decline,
all while expenses increased. Laura soon realized that they 
were spending too much money to spread the Jimmy Beans
Wool message. The company was headed for a cash crisis;
the Zanders stopped drawing salaries and had to meet pay-
roll for their employees out of their savings. They had to get 
Jimmy Beans Wool back on track.
The Zanders put their growth plans on hold and be-
gan to look closely at what had made their business suc-
cessful and what it had become. Jimmy Beans Wool had
lost its small, family business feel and was operating like
a big, impersonal corporation. Employee morale was flag-
ging. The Web site had been neglected, and its bounce rate 
had increased. Jimmy Beans Wool’s search engine optimi-
zation strategy was outdated and ineffective, and its social 
media presence had faded without Laura’s attention to drive
it. Overall, the Zanders realized that in the midst of their 
growth plans, their company had lost touch with the peo-
ple who were most important—its customers who loved to 
knit. To revitalize their business, the Zanders faced several 
important questions: Should Jimmy Beans Wool become a
$100 million company? Should they drop their line of fabric
and stick to selling wool and knitting supplies? Should the
company build its brand online, perhaps by focusing on in-
ternational sales, or should it open other retail stores around 
the country, perhaps by franchising? The Zanders hired a
consultant and found themselves and some of their employ-
ees sitting before a whiteboard ready to generate potential 
ideas for solving the company’s problems.
Questions
1. Is the Zanders’s dilemma—expansion goals causing 
the company to lose the character that made it success-
ful in the first place—a common one that entrepreneurs 
face? Why?
2. Assume the role of the Zanders’s consultant. What ad-
vice would you offer them concerning the fundamental 
questions they have about their business?

696
CASE 5 • JIMMY BEANS WOOL
3. What steps should the Zanders take to redesign their 
Web site and to get their company back on the first 
page of search results for the three largest search 
engines?
4. What should the Zanders do to address their company’s 
cash flow problems? What steps can they take to avoid 
cash flow problems in the future?
5. Write a brief report for the Zanders outlining your rec-
ommendations for getting their business back on track.

James Confectioners—Part 1
about the impact of the rapidly rising cost of the base choco-
late, however. Bad weather in South America and Africa, where 
most of the world’s cocoa is grown, and a workers’ strike dis-
rupted the global supply of chocolate, sending prices upward. 
There appears to be no relief from high chocolate prices in the 
near future. The International Cocoa Organization, an industry
trade association, forecasts world production of cocoa, from 
which chocolate is made, to decline by 7.2 percent this year.1
Escalating milk and sugar prices are squeezing the company’s 
profit margins as well. Much to James and Ivey’s dismay, James 
Confectioners’s long-term contracts with its chocolate suppliers 
have run out, and the company is purchasing its raw materials 
under short-term, variable-price contracts. They are concerned 
about the impact these increases in cost will have on the com-
pany’s financial statements and on its long-term health.
Ivey, who has the primary responsibility for managing 
James Confectioners’s finances, has compiled the balance
sheet and the income statement for the fiscal year that just 
ended. The two financial statements appear below:

Squeezed by Rising Costs, a Confectioner 
Struggles to Cope
Telford James and his wife, Ivey, are the second-generation 
owners of James Confectioners, a family-owned manufac-
turer of premium chocolates that was started by Telford’s 
father, Frank, in 1964 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. In its 50 years, 
James Confectioners has grown from its roots in a converted 
hardware store into a large, modern factory with sophisti-
cated production and quality control equipment. In the early 
days, all of Frank’s customers were local shops and stores,
but the company now supplies customers across the United
States and a few in Canada. Telford and Ivey have built on 
the company’s reputation as an honest, reliable supplier of 
chocolates. The prices they charge for their chocolates are 
above the industry average but are not anywhere near the 
highest prices in the industry even though the company is
known for producing quality products.
Annual sales for the company have grown to $3.9 million, 
and its purchases of the base chocolate used as the raw ma-
terials for their products have increased from 25,000 pounds 
20 years ago to 150,000 pounds. The Jameses are concerned

“How does the financial analysis look for this year, 
Hon?” Telford asks.
“I’m about to crunch the numbers now,” says Ivey. “I’m 
sure that rising chocolate prices have cut into our profit mar-
gins. The question is ‘How much?’’
“I think we’re going to have to consider raising prices, 
but I’m not sure how our customers will respond if we do,” 
says Telford. “What other options do we have?”
Questions
1. Calculate the 12 ratios for James Confectioners for 
this year.
2. How do the ratios that you calculated for this year 
compare to those that Ivey calculated for the company 
last year? What factors are most likely to account for 
those changes?
3. How do the ratios you calculated for this year compare 
to those of the typical company in the industry? Do 
you spot any areas that could cause the company prob-
lems in the future? Explain.
4. Develop a set of specific recommendations for improv-
ing the financial performance of James Confectioners 
using the analysis you conducted in questions 1 to 3.
5. What pricing recommendations can you make to 
Telford and Ivey James?
To see how the company’s financial position changes over 
time, Ivey calculates 12 ratios. She also compares James
Confectioners’s ratios to those of the typical firm in the 
industry. The table below shows the value of each of the 
12 ratios from last year and the industry median:

forecast before. They expect sales to increase 6.2 percent 
next year to $4,139,213. Credit sales account for 96 percent 
of total sales, and the company’s collection pattern for credit 
sales is 8 percent in the same month in which the sale is
generated, 54 percent in the first month after the sale is gen-
erated, and 34 percent in the second month after the sale is
generated. The Jameses have gathered estimates from their 
budget for the upcoming year.
Actual sales for the last two months, November and 
December, were $459,913 and $553,454, respectively. The 
company’s cash balance as of January 1 is $22,565. The in-
terest rate on James Confectioners’s current line of credit is 
8.25 percent, and the Jameses have established a minimum
cash balance of $10,000.
Questions
1. Develop a monthly cash budget for James 
Confectioners for the upcoming year.
2. What recommendations can you offer Telford and 
Ivey James to improve their company’s cash flow?
3. If you were Claudia Fernandes, the Jameses’ banker, 
would you be willing to increase the company’s line 
of credit? Explain.
Forecasting Cash Flow for a Small 
Confectioner
Telford James and his wife, Ivey, the second-generation 
owners of James Confectioners, a family-owned manufac-
turer of premium chocolates that was started by Telford’s 
father, Frank, in 1964 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, have be-
come increasingly concerned that turmoil in the banking and 
financial industries could have a negative impact on their 
business. They have read the headlines about bank closures,
heightened government scrutiny of the banking industry, 
and tight credit conditions, especially for small businesses.
The company has a $150,000 line of credit with Maple Leaf 
Bank, but the Jameses want to increase it to $250,000 as
a precautionary move. Last week, they contacted Claudia 
Fernandes, their personal banker at Maple Leaf, about in-
creasing the line of credit. In addition to reviewing James
Confectioners’s most recent balance sheet and income state-
ment, Fernandes said she would need a cash flow forecast 
for the upcoming year.
Although Telford and Ivey have prepared budgets for 
James Confectioners and have analyzed their financial state-
ments using ratio analysis, they have not created a cash flow

Where Should the Founder of a Social 
Media Marketing Company Turn for
Financing to Fuel His Fast-Growing 
Business?
As a Web developer, Brian Razzaque recognized the power 
and efficiency of social media marketing and wanted to make 
social media marketing easier for companies but wasn’t sure 
exactly how to achieve his goal. Then an employee asked to 
be notified every time Razzaque made a post to the company 
blog so that he could then share the post with his social net-
work. Razzaque realized that every company has “super fans,” 
customers with a strong affinity for a company and its brand, 
who will readily share content about the company if it is easy 
and convenient to do so. That realization was the beginning 
of Razzaque’s company, Baltimore-based SocialToaster, a 
platform that sends simple e-mails notifying super fans of 
new content, such as blog posts, articles, events, promotions,
and awards, that fans can, in turn, share with members of 
their own social networks with just one click. SocialToaster 
magnifies a company’s social media efforts many times over, 
drives traffic to its Web site, enhances customer engagement, 
and improves brand recognition and loyalty at minimal cost. 
In essence, SocialToaster allows a company’s super fans to 
increase exponentially the visibility of the content that the 
company creates through the fans’ social networks. Razzaque 
says promoting a business through a company’s super fans 
using SocialToaster is as easy as making toast.
Razzaque began promoting SocialToaster’s power and 
began landing clients around Baltimore. As success stories
began to spread, SocialToaster landed bigger clients, includ-
ing the Baltimore Ravens, the Baltimore Symphony Orches-
tra, the Detroit Lions, Lifetime Network, A&E, VH1, Sony 
Pictures, Universal Music, Johns Hopkins University, and
many others. Clients report that their fans share 60 to 74 per-
cent of the content they promote, providing exposure that 
is almost impossible for companies to achieve through their 
own social media accounts alone. In its first year of opera-
tions, SocialToaster generated $300,000 in sales, an amount 
that more than doubled to $800,000 in its second year.
Razzaque is at an important crossroads in the life of his 
company. He needs financing to fuel its rapid growth, but he 
wants to ensure that he selects the right sources of financing. 
He estimates that he will need $500,000 as bridge financ-
ing to fuel the company’s short-term growth. That financing
will give him time to raise the $2 million he will need to 
increase the size of SocialToaster’s sales force, hire account 
managers, increase the company’s marketing efforts across 
the globe to land more clients, and hire more technical staff 
to constantly upgrade and improve the product and enhance 
its features.
Razzaque has called on several wealthy individuals in
New York City, Boston, and Silicon Valley. None were will-
ing to invest in SocialToaster, but they did offer Razzaque 
helpful feedback that enabled him to improve his pitch. He
also discovered the differences in how potential investors 
in Silicon Valley and on the East Coast view start-up com-
panies. Razzaque says investors in Silicon Valley were not 
impressed by SocialToaster’s existing (but modest) revenue 
stream. Instead, they were looking at the company’s growth 
rate as an indicator of market potential. Does the company
have the potential to become a billion-dollar business? East 
Coast investors, however, were more interested in the com-
pany’s fundamentals, its revenue stream as proof that the 
product is viable, its “burn rate” (how quickly the company’s 
monthly expenditures were burning through its capital), the 
soundness of its business model, and its staying power.
Questions
1. What tips can you offer Brian Razzaque for creating a 
business plan that will attract the capital SocialToaster 
needs to fuel its growth?
2. What advice can you offer Razzaque about presenting 
his plan to potential lenders and investors?
3. Write a brief memo to Razzaque describing the 
advantages and disadvantages of using debt capital 
and equity capital.
4. Which sources of debt capital offer the greatest poten-
tial for SocialToaster’s financing needs? In what order 
would you prioritize the sources you have listed (from 
greatest potential to least potential).
5. Which sources of equity capital offer the greatest 
potential for SocialToaster’s financing needs? In what 
order would you prioritize the sources you have listed
(from greatest potential to least potential)?
6. What advice can you offer Razzaque about avoid-
ing potential dangers and pitfalls in accepting outside 
financing for a business?

Case 9
The Evolution of 
CoolPeopleCare’s Business Model
volunteer and job opportunities, and a nonprofit directory 
specific to each city.
After Davidson committed to working on CoolPeople-
Care full-time, it became apparent that he would have to 
change his business model to make the business viable. Over 
time, he had added several new revenue streams to the busi-
ness. Davidson began to offer speaking engagements and 
soon added training sessions for nonprofits to help them
create revenue streams that would alleviate the need for tra-
ditional fund-raising. Moseley also rolled his nonprofit con-
sulting practice into CoolPeopleCare. Next, Moseley and
Davidson wrote a book, New Day Revolution: How to Save 
the World in 24 Hours, and began to sell it through the Web 
site. They have sold thousands of copies of their book.
They realized they could also offer more value to the non-
profit community. They added “Partner Pages,” where non-
profits could highlight their organizations, consolidated event 
and volunteer listings, contact information, links to their own 
Web sites, donation buttons, national e-mail announcements,
and job listings. Nonprofits pay $1 a day to list on this page. 
Dozens of nonprofits soon took advantage of this new feature. 
Davidson and Moseley also added “Cool Pages” to allow cor-
porate sponsors to highlight their support of social causes.
The most significant change to the business model
was the addition of merchandise to the Web site, although 
at the time they did not realize its eventual impact. In addi-
tion to the book, the CoolPeopleCare store sells merchandise 
with the CoolPeopleCare logo, including T-
T shirts, coffee 
mugs, and reusable shopping bags. The site also sells fair 
trade coffee.
In May 2010, Nashville was hit by a devastating flood. 
The Thursday after the flood, CoolPeopleCare began selling 
“We Are Nashville” T-
T shirts to help raise money for flood 
relief. Davidson and Moseley had hoped to sell 1,000 shirts;
they reached that goal the first day. Eventually, CoolPeople-
Care made more than $100,000 in profits from T-
T shirt sales, 
which Davidson and Moseley donated to the Nashville
Community Foundation for flood relief. The site also sold 
“We Are Nashville” prints and bumper stickers that raised 
more money for this cause. In addition to the good that the 
new product line delivered for the people of Nashville, it 
helped put CoolPeopleCare on the map on a national and 
even global scale as orders came in from around the world 
for “We Are Nashville” products. This visibility helped take 
CoolPeopleCare to another level and reach a much broader 
audience.
From this experience with the flood relief effort, 
Davidson recognized the need to pay more attention to 
How Should the Founder of a Social 
Enterprise Increase the Visibility 
of His Company?
The original idea for CoolPeopleCare came to Sam Davidson 
after he had taken a trip to Washington, D.C., for a Save Darfur 
Rally in April 2006. While at the rally he saw a man holding a 
cardboard sign declaring “Cool People Care” and was struck 
by the power of the phrase. It had a really persuasive ring to it. 
Returning home to Nashville, Tennessee, Davidson couldn’t 
stop thinking about the phrase, “Cool People Care.” Initially 
he thought it would be appealing to build a Web site as a plat-
form to sell “Cool People Care” T-
T shirts and ask people what 
they care about.
Davidson approached Stephen Moseley, whom he had
met while working at a nonprofit in Nashville, for help to 
build a Web site to promote his CoolPeopleCare idea. A
15-minute conversation turned into a 3-hour planning ses-
sion in which Davidson and Moseley mapped out what the
first version of the Web site would look like.
Davidson had observed by working in nonprofits that 
people tended to give two main excuses for not volunteer-
ing or actively supporting a worthy cause: (1) “I don’t have 
enough time,” and (2) “I have no idea how to get started.” 
He believed that the CoolPeopleCare Web site could poten-
tially eliminate the excuses. Through the Web site, Davidson
wanted to enlighten and connect his audience. He envisioned 
that CoolPeopleCare would pair people who want to make 
a difference with organizations and opportunities that need 
their help. He recognized a need in the nonprofit sector for 
young, passionate people to connect with these organizations 
with the aim of making a positive difference in the world. He 
believed the Web site would be a good way to connect young 
people with causes they could help and support.
In May 2007, Davidson decided it was time to leave
his full-time job and dedicate himself to building and grow-
ing CoolPeopleCare. He set up the business as a social for-
profit venture. Davidson chose this form of business entity 
to ensure that his company did not compete for funds with 
the organizations it sought to help. He wanted the company 
to be self-f sustaining from its own revenue streams. He also
wanted to prove that a for-profit business could be successful
with a social mission.
The Web site initially had two main features. The first 
was 5 Minutes of Caring, which highlights a single action a
person could take in less than five minutes to make the world 
a better place. The second feature is customized content for 
more than 40 cities, which includes a community calendar,

CASE 9 • THE EVOLUTION OF COOLPEOPLECARE’S BUSINESS MODEL
promoting CoolPeopleCare to build awareness for the brand. 
By doing so, the company could help more nonprofits and 
reach more volunteers. He also saw the need for new prod-
ucts that reinforced the company’s social mission. However,
with a bootstrapped business, he also had to find creative
ways to market CoolPeopleCare without the benefits of a 
large advertising budget.
Questions
1. Identify several bootstrapping marketing techniques 
that would help CoolPeopleCare build brand aware-
ness and help the company grow. Explain how each 
approach to bootstrap marketing would work for this 
business.
2. Develop a detailed bootstrap marketing plan for 
CoolPeopleCare that offers specific ideas on how to 
promote the business. Why do you think the elements
of your plan will be successful?
3. Generate ideas for new products that would be 
consistent with CoolPeopleCare’s business model 
and mission. Explain each idea in detail.
4. Why did the business model of CoolPeopleCare
change over time? Explain why each of the changes 
in the business model was successful.
5. Develop a business model canvas for the current 
operations of CoolPeopleCare.
6. What specific recommendations would you make
to change the business model of CoolPeopleCare 
going forward? What is your rationale for each 
of these recommendations?

Case 10
InQuicker
How Can a Fast-Growing Small Company 
Maintain Its Unique, Employee-Friendly 
Culture?
InQuicker provides an online waiting room service for 
emergency rooms and urgent care centers. Its software 
enables patients to check-in and wait at home based on 
projected treatment times. InQuicker also offers online ap-
pointment scheduling services for medical clinics.
Michael Brody-Waite, cofounder and CEO, wants to
make InQuicker a cool and fun place to work. The first thing
visitors see when they walk into the InQuicker office is a 
ping-pong table. The workspace is open, with no cubicles, to
facilitate collaboration and teamwork.
InQuicker has a “culture club” that is responsible for 
leading activities to facilitate building a strong culture. Team 
members of InQuicker have weekly lunch meetings at a lo-
cal restaurant. Once a month an employee hosts the rest of 
the staff for a cookout at his or her home. Employees dress 
up and eat sweets for each person’s birthday and for various
holidays, and every year, the team spends a week together 
away from the office on a retreat.
The company offers employees flextime and flexspace, 
which employees to separate family time and work time. 
When employees are with family and friends, they are ex-
pected not to answer e-mails and phone calls from work.
t
In its early stages of InQuicker’s growth, Brody-Waite 
often rejected the opportunity to grow the business more 
quickly and to take on outside investments to preserve the
culture of the business.
However, the company did soon experience significant 
growth. Revenues grew from about $2 million in 2011 to
more than $5 million in 2013. Part of its growth came from
market expansion into new applications for its software 
beyond just emergency rooms into other segments of the 
healthcare industry. InQuicker offers software that facili-
tates referrals to specialists. When physicians refer patients 
to specialists, InQuicker enables patients to make appoint-
ments from iPads while sitting in their doctors’ offices.
Employment grew from 21 employees to 35 during
this two-year period. The growth in the number of employ-
ees has created challenges for a company so focused on its
employee-friendly culture. InQuicker has continued to focus
just as much on the cultural fit of job candidates as it does on
their skills and experience.
Brody-Waite has always been cautious about raising
money from venture capitalists or other outside investors, 
preferring to grow through bootstrapping. He knows inves-
tors want to see significant returns on their investments that 
most often require an exit plan. Brody-Waite’s primary focus
always has been on building a strong culture. His concern 
with equity investors is that they might pressure him to focus 
on growth, even if it jeopardizes his commitment to inten-
tionally developing InQuicker’s culture. However, the pace
and demands of its rapid growth may mean that InQuicker 
may have to look seriously at seeking equity investment.
Questions
1. Many entrepreneurs believe that corporate culture can
be a strong competitive advantage. Do you agree? 
Explain.
2. Why do company cultures, like the culture at InQuicker, 
appeal to employees, particularly members of 
Generation X and Generation Y? Explain.
3. What steps can Brody-Waite take to maintain 
InQuicker’s unique culture as the company grows?
