—KEVIN KELLY, CO-FOUNDER OF WIRED  
David Pogue
7th Edition
Covers all iPad models  
with iOS 8.1 software,

and iPad mini 3

Answers found here! 
With the iOS 8.1 software and new iPads—the Air 2 
and mini 3—Apple has taken its flagship tablets into 
new realms of power, speed, and good looks. The 
modern iPad comes with everything—touchscreen, 
cameras, stereo speakers, faster WiFi and cellular 
Internet—except a printed manual. Fortunately, David 
Pogue is back with this witty, full-color guide to the 
world’s most popular tablet.

Why I started the  
Missing Manual series. 
People learn best when 
information is engaging, clearly 
written, and funny. Unfortunately, 
most computer books read like 
dry catalogs. That’s why I created 
the Missing Manuals. They’re 
entertaining, unafraid to state 
when a feature is useless or 
doesn’t work right, and—oh, 
by the way—written by actual 
writers. And on every page, 
we answer the simple question: 
“What’s this feature for?”
David Pogue is the founder  
of YahooTech.com, a former  
New York Times columnist, an 
Emmy-winning TV host, and  
the creator of the Missing  
Manual series.

The important stuff  
you need to know
n	The iPad Air 2 and mini 3. This book unearths 
all the secrets of the crazy-thin new iPads: 
better screens, faster chips, responsive finger­
print readers, Apple Pay.
n	The iOS 8.1 software. Even older iPad models 
gain predictive typing, iCloud Drive, Family 
Sharing, “Hey Siri,” and about 195 more new 
features. It’s all here, in these pages.
n	The apps. That catalog of 700,000 add-on 
programs takes the iPad into new realms of 
usefulness and fun. Now you’ll know how to 
find, exploit, and troubleshoot those apps.
n	The iPad may be the world’s best-selling tablet 
computer, but it’s still a computer, with all of 
a computer’s complexities. iPad: The Missing 
Manual is a funny, gorgeously illustrated guide 
to the tips, shortcuts, and workarounds that 
will turn you, too, into an iPad master.

The Missing Credits
David Pogue (author, illustrator, indexer) is the founder 
of Yahoo Tech (yahootech.com), a job for which he was 
groomed by 13 years writing the weekly tech column for 
The New York Times.
He’s also a monthly columnist for Scientific American, 
a two-time Emmy-winning correspondent for CBS 
News Sunday Morning, the host of NOVA miniser-
ies on PBS, and the creator of the Missing Manual series. He’s writ-
ten or co-written 75 books, including 30 in this series, six in the For 
Dummies line (including Macs, Magic, Opera, and Classical Music), 
two novels (one for middle-schoolers), and The World According to 
Twitter. In his other life, David is a former Broadway show conductor, a  
magician, and a funny public speaker. He lives in Connecticut with his wife, 
Nicki, and three awesome children.
Links to his columns and videos await at www.davidpogue.com. He wel-
comes feedback about his books by email at david@pogueman.com. 
Julie Van Keuren (copy editor, indexer) quit her newspaper job in 2006 
and moved to Montana to live the freelance-editing dream. She and her 
husband, M.H. (who’s living the novel-writing dream), have two teenage 
sons, Dexter and Michael. Email: little_media@yahoo.com.
Phil Simpson (design and layout) runs his graphic design business from 
Southbury, Connecticut. His work includes corporate branding, publica-
tion design, communications support, and advertising. In his free time he 
is a homebrewer, ice cream maker, wannabe woodworker, and is on a few

Acknowledgments
The Missing Manual series is a joint venture between the dream team 
introduced on these pages and O’Reilly Media. I’m grateful to all of them, 
especially to designer Phil Simpson, prose queen Julie Van Keuren, and 
the astonishingly knowledgeable Rich Koster. He served as the technical 
editor of iPhone: The Missing Manual, from which much of this book was 
adapted.
As the sun began to set on this book’s deadline, I appealed to my fol-
lowers on Twitter to help beta-read this book. My new best friends Tim 
Allen, Richard Wemberley, Adriana Belotti, Bill Groll, Clark Averill, Elizabeth 
Howell, Gilbert Tang, Grace Suarez, Lew Piper, Robert Ameeti, Jeff 
Hagedon, Logan Buren, Ken Falk, Tom Kerber, Matt Hausmann, and Skip 
Dodson cheerfully answered the call. They enthusiastically found all kinds 
of little things (and big ones) that needed fixing, and I’m deeply grateful.
A few other friends did massive favors for this book. Apple’s Trudy Muller 
and Andy Bowman were incredibly generous in chasing down elusive 
technical answers. Philip Michaels did the original Game Center writeup. 
O’Reilly’s Brian Sawyer accommodated my chaotic schedule without 
once threatening to break my kneecaps. And my incredible assistant Jan 
Carpenter kept me from falling apart like wet Kleenex.
I’m supremely grateful to my former New York Times colleague Jude 
Biersdorfer. iPad: The Missing Manual was her book for six editions; this 
year, an intensified schedule at The Times forced her to give up her baby. 
She was spectacularly cool about letting me take it over.
Thanks to David Rogelberg and Tim O’Reilly for believing in the idea, and 
above all, to Nicki, Kell, Tia, and Jeffrey. They make these books—and 
everything else—possible.
—David Pogue
The Missing Manual Series
Missing Manuals are witty, superbly written guides to computer products 
that don’t come with printed manuals (which is just about all of them). 
Each book features a handcrafted index, cross-references to speciﬁc page 
numbers (not just “see Chapter 14”), and an ironclad promise never to put 
an apostrophe in the possessive pronoun “its.”

Introduction
1
I
t’s often said that Steve Jobs, Apple’s founder, knew what the public 
wanted before it did. Over and over again, Apple came up with inven-
tions that seemed to feed a hunger we didn’t know we had.
There’s no better example than the iPad. Apple unveiled it in January 2010, 
three months before anybody could actually buy one. Without ever hav-
ing tried the it, tech critics called it the dumbest machine ever invented. 
“An utter disappointment and abysmal failure,” wrote the Orange County 
Design Blog. “Consumers seem genuinely baffled by why they might 
need it,” said Businessweek. “It’s nothing more than a luxury bauble that 
will appeal to a few gadget freaks,” declared Bloomberg. “Insanely great 
it is not,” snarked CBS MarketWatch. “My god, am I underwhelmed,” said 
Gizmodo.
As we know now, the joke was on them. Apple sold 300,000 iPads on the 
first day they were available; 1 million in the first month; 250 million in the 
first seven years. The iPad became the fastest-adopted new product cat-
egory in history.
The iPad Defined
Now here we are, five iPad models (and three mini models) later, and we 
can now see that the iPad was a turning point in computing history. Today, 
lots of people carry around an iPad instead of a laptop. 
Your ability to replace a laptop with an iPad, however, depends on what 
you want to do with it. For years, the conventional wisdom was that the 
iPad is fantastic for consuming material—surfing the Web, reading ebooks, 
watching videos, playing music, doing a first pass on email—but a clumsy 
tool for creating it. Sometimes, a mouse and keyboard are faster, more 
precise tools than your fat fingertips.

These days, that view has softened. Especially in iOS 8.1, the iPad’s dicta-
tion feature has gotten so fast and accurate that you don’t ache for a key-
board quite so much.
And then there are the apps (programs). Sooooooo many apps. 750,000 
apps written just for the iPad, including, surprisingly, Microsoft Office.
And then there are those 1.3 million iPhone apps that also run on the iPad.
The iPad is already a thin, light, touchscreen computer with a dazzling 
screen. But those apps turn it into a sensational Internet viewer. It shows 
fully formatted email (with attachments, thank you) and displays entire 
Web pages with fonts and design intact. It’s tricked out with a tilt sensor, 
a proximity sensor, a light sensor, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, a gyroscope, and 
that amazing multitouch screen.
For many people, the iPad is also a camera and a camcorder—one that’s 
getting better with every year’s new model.
Furthermore, it’s a calendar, address book, alarm clock, stopwatch, traffic 
reporter, RSS reader, medical reference, musical keyboard, time tracker, 
remote control, reader, and so on. And, whoa, those games! Thousands of 
them, with smooth 3-D graphics and tilt control. 
All of this sends the iPad’s utility and power through the roof. 
By the way: As a thoughtful courtesy to people who own multiple Apple 
gadgets (as well as people who write books about them), Apple wrote 
iOS to work almost identically on the iPad and the iPhone. Where things 
are, what they’re called, and what they look like is almost exactly the same.
In fact, there are only a few iPhone features that the iPad doesn’t have, 
some of which may surprise you:
• Phone features. Without the assistance of an iPhone, an iPad can’t 
make a traditional phone call or send traditional text messages. 
• Vibrate mode. The iPad can get your attention with visuals and 
sound, but not touch; there’s no vibration.
• Certain apps. For reasons nobody can quite figure out, the iPad 
doesn’t come with as many apps as the iPhone. It’s missing Calculator, 
Stocks, Weather, Voice Memos, Compass, and Health.
• A flash. There are cameras on the iPad, front and back, but it doesn’t 
have a flash.

Meet iOS
Apple introduces a new iPad model every fall. In October 2014, for exam-
ple, it introduced the sixth full-size iPad model—the iPad Air 2—and the 
third 7-inch model, the iPad mini 3. They’re thinner, faster, and better in 
most ways.
More importantly, there’s a new, free version of the iPad’s software, called 
iOS 8.1. (Why not “iPad OS” anymore? Because the same operating sys-
tem runs on the iPhone and iPod Touch. It’s not just for iPads anymore, and 
saying “the iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch OS” takes too long.)
You can run iOS 8 on older iPad models without having to buy a new 
phone. This book covers all phones that can run iOS 8: the iPad Air 2, iPad 
Air, iPad 2, iPad 3rd Generation, iPad 4th Generation, and all three mini 
models. 
About This Book
You don’t get a printed manual when you buy an iPad. Online, you can find 
an electronic PDF manual that covers the basics well, but it’s largely free 
of details, hacks, workarounds, tutorials, humor, and any acknowledgment 
of the iPad’s flaws. You can’t easily mark your place, underline, or read it 
in the bathroom. 
The purpose of this book, then, is to serve as the manual that should have 
accompanied the iPad. (If your older iPad doesn’t have iOS 8, you really 
need one of this book’s earlier editions.)
Writing a book about the iPad is a study in exasperation, because the 
darned thing is a moving target. Apple updates the iPad’s software fairly 
often, piping in new features, bug fixes, speed-ups, and so on. 
Therefore, you should think of this book the way you think of the first 
iPad: as a darned good start. To keep in touch with updates we make to it 
as developments unfold, drop in to the book’s Errata/Changes page. (Go 
to www.missingmanuals.com, click this book’s name, and then click View/
Submit Errata.)
Tip: This book covers the iOS 8.1.2 software. There will surely be an 8.1.3, 
an 8.2, and so on. Check this book’s page at www.missingmanuals.
com to read about those updates when they occur.

About the Outline
iPad: The Missing Manual is divided into five parts, each containing several 
chapters:
• Part 1, iPad Basics, covers everything related to instant communi-
cation: voice calls, video calls, text messaging, iMessages, and the 
Contacts (address book) program. It’s also where you can read about 
entering text, either by typing or by speaking; Siri, the “virtual assis-
tant”; and the rich array of features for people with disabilities—some 
of which are surprisingly useful even for people without them.
• Part 2, Pix, Flix & Apps, is dedicated to the iPad’s built-in apps, with a 
special emphasis on its multimedia abilities: playing music, podcasts, 
movies, TV shows, and photos; capturing photos and videos; the 
Maps app; reading ebooks; and so on. These chapters also cover 
some of the standard techniques that most apps share: installing, 
organizing, and quitting them; switching among them; and sharing 
material from within them using the Share sheet. 
• Part 3, The iPad Online, is a detailed exploration of the iPad’s third tal-
ent: its ability to get you onto the Internet, either over a WiFi hotspot 
connection or (if you have a cellular model) via the cellular network. 
It’s all here: email, Web browsing, and tethering (that is, letting your 
phone serve as a sort of Internet antenna for your laptop).
• Part 4, Connections, describes the world beyond the iPad itself—like 
the copy of iTunes on your Mac or PC that can fill up the iPad with 
music, videos, and photos; and syncing the calendar, address book, 
and mail settings. These chapters also cover the iPad’s control panel, 
the Settings program; Continuity (the wireless integration of iPad and 
Mac); and how the iPad syncs wirelessly with corporate networks 
using Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync—or with your own computers 
using Apple’s iCloud service.
• Part 5, Appendixes, contains two reference chapters. Appendix A 
walks you through the setup process; Appendix B is a master com-
pendium of troubleshooting, maintenance, and battery information.
AboutÆTheseÆArrows
Throughout this book, and throughout the Missing Manual series, you’ll 
find sentences like this one: Tap SettingsÆGeneralÆKeyboard. That’s 
shorthand for a much longer instruction that directs you to open three 
nested screens in sequence, like this: “Tap the Settings button. On the next 
screen, tap General. On the screen after that, tap Keyboard.” (In this book, 
tappable things on the screen are printed in orange to make them stand 
out.)

Introduction

Similarly, this kind of arrow shorthand helps to simplify the business of 
choosing commands in menus on your Mac or PC, like FileÆPrint.

iPad Air 2: What’s New
Apple’s usual routine is to introduce a new iPad every October. In the 2014 
model, here’s what’s new:
• Thinner. That’s really the biggest feature: The Air 2 is less than a quar-
ter of an inch thick (6.1 millimeters). Any thinner, and you could fold it 
into a paper airplane.
A tablet is something you have to hold all the time you’re using it, so 
thinness and lightness matter.
• Faster. There’s a new processor inside: Apple’s own chip, the A8X. 
Apple says it’s 40 percent faster than before, and it does feel faster. 
Yet the iPad’s 10-hour battery life hasn’t suffered as a result.
• Camera. The camera’s been improved, too. It has a new, 8-megapixel 
sensor that brings to the iPad most of the tricks of the iPhone 6, 
like time-lapse video, slow motion, burst mode, self-timer, and pan-
orama mode. It still lacks some of the iPhone camera’s awesomeness, 
though—like superfast autofocus (what Apple calls “focus pixels”), 
optical stabilization, hypersmooth 60 frames-per-second video, and a 
tap-to-focus feature.
• Fingerprint sensor. The iPad Air 2 has a fingerprint sensor embed-
ded into the Home button (what Apple calls Touch ID), just as the last 
couple of iPhones have. It’s smooth, fast, and reliable; it doesn’t care 
what angle your finger is at. In many cases, it spares you having to 
remember passwords.

Introduction
6
You can use your fingerprint to unlock the iPad Air 2, or to make pur-
chases from Apple’s online stores (music, movies, apps), or, now, to 
buy stuff online with just a touch of your finger.
This doesn’t mean that you can buy things in physical stores by wield-
ing your iPad, as you can with the iPhone 6 models. You can, however, 
use your fingerprint for the other part of Apple Pay: shopping online 
from within shopping apps like Houzz (housewares), Fancy.com; Tar-
get; Panera Bread; Uber, and so on.
• Faster WiFi. WiFi is much faster on the iPad Air 2—and you really feel 
it when you’re opening Web pages. The cellular iPad models ($130 
extra) are 50 percent faster than before, too. 
• Better screen. Apple reduced the number of layers between your eye 
and the image, so that the image seems slightly closer to your fingers. 
Apple also says the screen is less reflective than before. 

Introduction
7
• Universal SIM card. Apple now sells a single cellular iPad model that 
can hop onto any of three U.S. cellular networks: AT&T, Sprint, or 
T-Mobile. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean you can freely flit between 
those companies; there’s a lot of fine print (page 25).
The iPad comes in 16-, 64-, or 128-gigabyte models these days, with black 
or white fronts and black, white, or gold backs. The model with a cellular 
connection always costs $130 more.
iPad Mini 3: What’s New
There’s a new iPad mini this year, too. Apple made only one change to it, 
though: It now has a Touch ID fingerprint reader built into the Home but-
ton, just as on its big brother.
The mini remains a fascinating machine, though. Its 7.9-inch screen dis-
plays just as much image as the bigger iPad’s 9.7-inch screen—just smaller. 
You can carry this thing in an overcoat pocket or a purse, making it much 
more transportable, manageable, and handleable.
What’s New in iOS 8
In 2013, Apple freaked out the world by introducing a radical iPad-soft-
ware redesign in iOS 7: clean, white, almost barren, with a razor-thin font 
(Helvetica Neue) and bright, light colors. The design was controversial and 
polarizing.
The iOS 8 design is the same—by now, people have gotten used to it—so 
the improvements now are focused on features and flexibility.
TIP: If the fonts are too thin for your taste, you can fatten them up just 
enough by turning on SettingsÆDisplay & BrightnessÆBold Text. 
While you’re there, you can make text larger in most apps, too; tap 
the Larger Type control.
Apple says iOS 8 contains over 200 new features, but here are the big-
ticket items:
• Predictive keyboard (and Swype, and SwiftKey). At long last, the 
iPad now offers three onscreen buttons, predicting the next word 
you’re likely to type above the onscreen keyboard. It’s smart enough 
to save you a lot of typing. 
But if you think other companies do the onscreen keyboard thing 
better, go for it: In iOS 8, you can now install any of dozens of popular 
keyboard systems, like Swype or SwiftKey, to replace Apple’s.

Introduction
8
• Family Sharing. The days of having to share your iCloud password 
with your kid—or to type it into the kid’s phone every time he wants 
to download something—are over. Now, up to six family members 
can share one another’s Apple-purchased books, videos, and music. 
You can keep track of your teenagers’ locations. And you each get 
a common Family category in Calendar, Reminders, and Photos, so 
the whole family can share. 
• iCloud Drive. Now there’s a single folder in the sky—the iCloud 
Drive— that stores whatever files you want to be able to access from 
any Mac, Windows PC, phone, or tablet. It’s like the Apple version of 
Dropbox.
• Expanded Spotlight. The iPad’s built-in search bar can find all kinds 
of stuff beyond the phone. You can search for Wikipedia entries, 
movie showtimes, news, Apple’s online app/movie/bookstores, and 
so on.
• Continuity. If you have an iPhone too, prepare to be mind-blown. 
The suite of features Apple calls Continuity (Chapter 15) makes 
the phone an extension of the iPad. Now you can use the iPad as a 
speakerphone, taking and making calls. You can send and receive 
text messages from your iPad—to any cellphone, Apple or not. You 
can begin working on something in Mail, Safari, Pages, Numbers, 
Keynote, Maps, Messages, Reminders, Calendar, or Contacts—and 
when you arrive at your Mac or iPhone, the half-finished document is 
magically already on the screen, ready to complete.
• Photo editing. There’s a lot less need to duck into another app to 
adjust color, saturation, brightness, and other photographic settings; 
that’s all right in the Photos app now. So is a search command. So 
are “smart albums” that can round up all photos taken within a cer-
tain time period, or in a certain place.
• Video and audio texting. Hard to explain, easy to use: Now, when 
you’re texting in Messages, you can hold down a button to record 
a sound or a video instead of typing; when you release your fin-
ger, it shoots off to the recipient instantly. The iPad becomes a 
walkie-talkie.
• Mail upgrades. You can swipe across a Mail message in the list to 
delete it—no second confirmation tap required. Swipe a different 
way to archive it, flag it, or mark it as read. When you’re composing a 
message, you can now refer to another message without losing your 
place. And Data Detectors, a great feature on the Mac, have finally 
come to the iPad: When an incoming message contains the sender’s 
contact information or a date for an event, Mail offers to pop it into 
Contacts or Calendar automatically.

Introduction
9
• A thousand helpful tweaks. When a notification about an incoming 
text, mail message, calendar invitation, or reminder appears, you can 
reply, delete it, accept it, or snooze it on the spot—right in the notifi-
cation banner. The app-switcher screen now has icons of the people 
you contact the most, so shooting off a call or a text is only a double-
press of the Home button away. 
You can use the fingerprint reader (iPad Air 2, mini 3) to do more than 
unlock the phone. You can use it to log into apps instead of remem-
bering a password. The Camera app can now record time-lapse video.
• They’ve fixed Siri. Siri’s speech recognition is much more accurate, 
especially if you have an accent. You see the words appear as you’re 
speaking them now. And there’s a new, hands-free, “always listening” 
mode for Siri whenever the iPad is charging (for example, in the car). 
Even if it’s asleep, you can say, “Hey, Siri” to make it listen to a spoken 
command.
It’s a lot of tweaks, polishing, and finesse—and a lot to learn. Fortunately, 
500 pages of instructions now await you.

I
magine your grandparents coming across the iPad lying on your 
desk. They might not guess it was a computer (let alone a music 
player/Web browser/alarm clock/stopwatch/voice recorder/musical 
instrument/compass/camera).
It’s all there, though, hidden inside this sleek, thin slab. 
For the rest of this book, and for the rest of your life with the iPad, you’ll 
be expected to know what’s meant by, for example, “the Home button” 
and “the Sleep switch.” A guided tour, therefore, is in order.

Sleep Switch (On/Off)
You could argue that knowing how to turn on your tablet might be a useful 
skill. For that, you need the Sleep switch. It’s a metal button shaped like a 
dash on the top-right edge.
It has several functions:
• Sleep/Wake. Tapping it once puts the iPad to sleep—into Standby 
mode, ready for receiving Internet data but consuming very little 
power. Tapping it again turns on the screen so it’s ready for action. 
• On/Off. The same switch can also turn the iPad off completely so 
it consumes no power at all. You might turn the iPad off whenever 
you’re not going to use it for a few days. 
To turn the iPad off, press the Sleep switch for 3 seconds. The screen 
changes to say slide to power off.
Confirm your decision by placing a fingertip on the π and sliding to 
the right. The device shuts off completely.

The Guided Tour

Tip: If you change your mind about turning the iPad off, tap the Cancel 
button or do nothing; after a moment, the iPad backs out of the 
slide to power off screen automatically.
To turn the iPad back on, press the switch again for 1 second. The 
Apple logo appears as the tablet boots up. (The Apple logo is black if 
your iPad is white and white if your iPad is black. Nice touch.)
• Force restart. The Sleep switch has one more function. If your iPad 
is frozen, and no buttons work, and you can’t even turn the thing off, 
this button is also involved in force-restarting the whole machine. 
Steps for this last-ditch procedure are on page 512. 
Locked Mode
When you don’t touch the screen for 1 minute (or another interval you 
choose), or when you put the iPad to sleep, the tablet locks itself. When it’s 
locked, the screen is dark and doesn’t respond to touch. If music is playing, 
it keeps going; if you’re recording audio, the recording proceeds. 
But when the tablet is locked, you don’t have to worry about accidental 
button pushes. You wouldn’t want to discover that your iPad has been tak-
ing photos from the depths of your bag. 
Tip: Deep in SettingsÆGeneral, you’ll find the Lock/Unlock switch. That 
refers to Apple’s magnetic-closure iPad cases. If this switch is on, 
then closing the case’s cover puts the iPad to sleep automatically, 
and opening the cover wakes it. A nice arrangement, really.
The Lock Screen
To wake the iPad when it’s locked, press either the Sleep switch or the 
Home button. 
That gesture alone doesn’t fire up the full iPad world, though. Instead, it 
presents the Lock screen.
From here, slide your finger rightward across the screen (anywhere—you 
don’t have to aim for the slide to unlock area!) to unlock the tablet with 
your password or fingerprint. (See page 48 or page 50.)

Chapter 1
14
Note: You can adjust how quickly the tablet locks itself, or make it stop 
locking itself altogether; see page 475.
Things to Do on the Lock Screen
These days, though, the Lock screen is more than just a big Do Not Disturb 
sign. It’s a lively bulletin board for up-to-date information about your life—
information you can scan or work with right at the Lock screen.

For starters, you can use the iPad as a watch—lots of people do. Just tap 
the Sleep switch to consult the Lock screen’s time and date display, and 
put the tablet right down again. The iPad goes back to sleep after a few 
seconds. 
Better yet, the Lock screen is a handy status screen. Here you see a record 
of everything that happened while you weren’t paying attention. It’s a list 
of messages received, notifications from your apps, and other essential 
information. 
Now, each of these notices has come from a different app (software pro-
gram). To see a Facebook post, for example, you’d want to open the Face­
book app; to reply to a message, you’d want the Messages app, and so on. 
So here’s a handy shortcut: You can dive directly into the relevant app by 
swiping your finger across the notification itself, like this: 
That shortcut saves you the trouble of unlocking the iPad and trying to 
find the corresponding app.
Tip: If you’d rather not have all these details show up on the Lock screen, 
you can turn them off. (Privacy is the main reason you might want 
to do so—the bad guys don’t need a password to view your Lock 
screen. They just have to tap the Sleep switch or the Home button.)
You can hide these items from your Lock screen on an app-by-app 
basis. For example, you might want missed calls to show up here 
but not missed text messages. To set this up, choose SettingsÆ​
Notifications. Tap the app in question; turn off Show on Lock 
Screen.
More ways to accomplish things on the Lock screen:
• Swipe down from the top of the screen to view your Notification 
Center—a detailed one-stop screen that shows your missed calls, 
texts, and emails; upcoming appointments; stock and weather alerts; 
and so on. (See page 42.)
• Swipe up from the bottom edge to open the Control Center, with 
all the important settings (volume, brightness, play/pause music, 
Airplane mode, flashlight, and more) in one place. See page 37.
• Swipe up on the camera (s) icon to open the Camera app (page 
201).

Chapter 1
16
• Swipe up on the app icon at lower left, if you see one. This feature, 
new in iOS 8, is supposed to let you know when there’s an app you 
might find useful based on your location right now. 
If you’re entering a Starbucks, the Starbucks app icon might appear 
there, so that you can pay wirelessly. If you’re at a train station, your 
tablet might use this opportunity to let you know about a schedule 
app for that train line. You may also see this little icon as you enter a 
bank, store, hospital, college, and so on (assuming your iPad can get 
online at the time).
In each case, the suggested app opens when you swipe up on this 
icon. Or, if you don’t have the app already, the App Store opens to the 
right page, so that you can download the app.
TIP
Creeped out? You can turn off this lower-left app-suggestion feature 
easily enough. Choose SettingsÆNotifications. Tap App Store, and 
then turn off Show on Lock Screen.
Locking Down the Lock Screen
Now, remember: You can enjoy any of the activities described above even 
before you’ve entered your password or used your fingerprint. 
In other words, some stranger picking up your iPad can do all of these 
things, too. If that bothers you, don’t worry; you can turn all of those fea-
tures off on the corresponding Settings screens. For example, to block 
Lock-screen access to your Control Center, open SettingsÆControl Center. 
Turn off Access on Lock Screen. To turn off individual apps’ presence on 
the Lock screen, open SettingsÆControl Center; tap the app’s name, and 
then turn off Show on Lock Screen.

Home Button
Here it is: the one and only button on the front of this tablet. Push it to 
summon the Home screen, which is your gateway to everything the iPad 
can do. (You can read more about the Home screen at the end of this 
chapter.)
The Home button is a wonderful thing. It means you can never get lost. No 
matter how deeply you burrow into the iPad’s software, no matter how far 
off track you find yourself, one push of the Home button takes you back 
to the beginning. 
On the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 models, of course, the Home button is 
also a fingerprint scanner—one that actually works.
But, as time goes on, Apple keeps saddling the Home button with more 
and more functions. It’s become Apple’s only way to provide shortcuts for 
common features; that’s what you get when you design a tablet that has 
only one button. In iPad Land, you can press the Home button one, two, 
or three times for different functions—or even hold it down. Here’s the 
rundown.
Quick Press: Wake Up
Pressing the Home button once wakes the tablet if it’s in locked mode. 
That’s sometimes easier than finding the Sleep switch on the edge. It gives 
you a quick glance at your notifications and missed texts—or the time and 
date.

Momentary Touch: Unlock (iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3)
If you’ve taught the iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 to recognize your fingerprint, 
then just resting your finger on the Home button is enough to unlock the 
tablet, bypassing the password screen. In other words, you should get into 
the habit of pressing the Home button (to wake the tablet) and then leav-
ing your finger on it for about a half-second to unlock it. Page 48 has 
more on fingerprints. 
Long Press: Siri
If you hold down the Home button for about 3 seconds, you wake up Siri, 
your virtual voice-controlled assistant. Details are in Chapter 3.
Two Quick Presses: App Switcher
If, once the tablet is awake, you press the Home button twice quickly, the 
current image fades away—to reveal the app switcher screen, the key to 
the iPad’s multitasking feature.
What you see here are icons and currently open screens of the programs 
you’ve used most recently (older ones are to the right), as shown below. 
Swipe horizontally to bring more apps into view; the Home screen is 
always at the far left.

The Guided Tour
19
With a single tap (on either the icon or the screen miniature), you can jump 
right back into a program you had open, without waiting for it to start up, 
show its welcome screen, and so on—and without having to scroll through 
11 Home screens trying to find the icon of a favorite app.
In short, the app switcher gives you a way to jump directly to another app, 
without a layover at the Home screen first.
Tip: On this screen, you can also quit a program by flicking it upward. 
In fact, you can quit several programs at once, using two or three 
fingers. Fun for the whole family!
This app switcher is the only visible element of the iPad’s multitasking fea-
ture. Once you get used to it, that double-press of the Home button will 
become second nature—and your first choice for jumping among apps.
Two Quick Presses: Your VIP List
In iOS 8, the app switcher screen offers another new feature that you may 
eventually rank as one of iOS 8’s finest: the VIP list. 
That’s not what Apple calls it, but that’s what it is: a row of headshots, at 
the top of the screen, that represent the people you’ve contacted most 
recently and most often. See page 277 for details on this extraordinarily 
handy feature.
Three Presses: VoiceOver, Zoom, Inverted Colors…
In SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibility, you can set up a triple-press of 
the Home button to turn one of several accessibility features on or off: 
VoiceOver (the tablet speaks whatever you touch), Invert Colors (white-
on-black type, which is sometimes easier to see), Grayscale (a new 
mode that makes the whole iPad black-and-white); Zoom (magnifies the 
screen), Switch Control (accommodates external gadgets like sip-and-
puff straws), and AssistiveTouch (help for people who have trouble with 
physical switches). 
All of these features are described beginning on page 154.
Tip: The Home button is also part of the force quit sequence—a good 
troubleshooting technique when a particular program seems to be 
acting up. See page 512.

Chapter 1
20
Mute Switch, Volume Keys
The mute switch is a tiny flipper on the right edge at the top. 
Note: There’s a mute switch on every model until the iPad Air 2, which 
doesn’t have one. The Air 2 has a mute switch on the screen—in 
the Control Center, described on page 37.
On a phone, the mute switch means that no ringer will humiliate you in a 
meeting, at a movie, or in church. Since you can’t receive traditional phone 
calls with the iPad, though, this switch isn’t quite as essential. Which is 
probably why Apple lets you change it into a Lock Rotation switch instead 
(page 38). And why Apple killed it off in the Air 2.
Note: Even when silenced, the iPad still makes noise in certain 
circumstances: when an alarm goes off; when you’re playing 
music; when you’re using Find My iPad (page 37); when you’re 
using VoiceOver; or, sometimes, when a game is playing.
On the same right edge, you’ll find the volume controls. They work in var-
ious ways:
• 	When you’re listening to music, they adjust the playback volume—
even when the tablet is locked and dark.
• 	When you’re taking a picture, either one serves as a shutter button or 
a camcorder start/stop button.
• 	At all other times, they adjust the volume of sound effects like the 
ringer, alarms, and Siri.
• 	When a FaceTime call comes in, they silence the ringing or vibrating.
In each case, if the screen is on, a corresponding volume graphic appears 
on the screen to show you where you are on the volume scale.

The touchscreen is your mouse, keyboard, and notepad. You might expect 
it to get fingerprinty and streaky.

But the iPad has an oleophobic screen. That may sound like an irrational 
fear of yodeling, but it actually refers to a coating that repels grease. A 
wipe on your clothes restores the screen to its right-out-of-the-box crys-
tal sheen.
You can also use the screen as a mirror when the iPad is off.
The iPad models with Retina screens have crazy high resolution (the num-
ber of tiny pixels per inch). It’s really, really sharp, as you’ll discover when 
reading text or making out the details of a map or a photo. The Retina 
models manage 2048 × 1536 pixels (more dots than a high-definition TV); 
earlier models have 1024 × 768.
The front of the iPad is made of Gorilla Glass, a special formulation made 
by Corning. It’s unbelievably resistant to scratching. (You can still shatter it 
if you drop it just the wrong way.)
Note: This is how Corning’s Web site says this glass is made: “The 
glass is placed in a hot bath of molten salt at a temperature of 
approximately 400°C. Smaller sodium ions leave the glass, and 
larger potassium ions from the salt bath replace them. These 
larger ions take up more room and are pressed together when 
the glass cools, producing a layer of compressive stress on the 
surface of the glass. This layer of compression creates a surface 
that is more resistant to damage from everyday use.”
But you probably guessed as much.
If you’re nervous about protecting your iPad, you can always get a case for 
it. But if you’re worried about scratching the glass, you’re probably worry­
ing too much. It’s really hard to scratch.
Radio signals can’t pass through metal. That’s why there’s a plastic strip 
on the top back.
Screen Icons
Here’s a roundup of the icons you may see in the status bar at the top of 
the iPad screen, from left to right:
• µ Cell signal. As on a phone, the number of bars—or dots, in 
iOS 8’s case—indicates the strength of your cell signal (if you have a 
cellular iPad), and thus the quality of your Internet connection when 
you’re beyond a WiFi hotspot. If there are no dots, then the dreaded 
words “No service” appear here.

Chapter 1
22
• Network name and type. These days, different parts of the country—
and even your street—are blanketed by cellular Internet signals of dif-
ferent speeds, types, and ages. Your status bar always shows you the 
kind of signal it has right now. From slowest to fastest: 
G or ˝ means your cellular iPad is connected to your carrier’s slowest, 
oldest Internet system. You might be able to check email, but you’ll 
lose your mind waiting for a Web page to load.
If you see the 3 logo, you’re in a city where your cell company has 
installed a 3G network—meaning fairly decent Internet speed. A 4 
logo is better yet; you have speed in between 3G and LTE.
And if you see 9 up there—well, then, get psyched. You have a fairly 
recent iPad (3rd Generation or later), and you’re in a city with a 4G 
LTE cellular network. And that means very fast Internet (maybe even 
faster than you have at home), fast Web browsing, fast app down-
loading—just fast.
• | Airplane Mode. If you see the airplane instead of signal and WiFi 
bars, then the iPad is in Airplane mode (page 346). 
• p Do Not Disturb. When the tablet is in Do Not Disturb mode, noth-
ing can make it ring, buzz, or light up except communications from 
the most important people. Details on page 121.
• ∑ WiFi signal. When you’re connected to a wireless Internet 
hotspot, this indicator appears. The more “sound waves,” the stronger 
the signal.
• 9:50 AM. When the iPad is unlocked, a digital clock appears on the 
status bar. 
• J Alarm. You’ve got an alarm set. This reminder, too, can be valuable, 
especially when you intend to sleep late and don’t want an alarm to 
go off.
• b Bluetooth. The iPad is connected wirelessly to a Bluetooth ear-
piece, speaker, or car system. (If this symbol is gray, then it means 
Bluetooth is turned on but not connected to any other gear—and not 
sucking down battery power.)

The Guided Tour

• v VPN. You corporate stud, you! You’ve managed to connect to 
your corporate network over a secure Internet connection, probably 
with the assistance of a systems administrator—or by consulting page 
464.
• n Syncing. The iPad is currently syncing with some Internet service—
iCloud, for example (Chapter 15).
• B Battery meter. When the iPad is charging, the lightning bolt 
appears. Otherwise, the battery logo “empties out” from right to left 
to indicate how much charge remains. (You can even add a “% full” 
indicator to this gauge; see page 38.)
• ˜ Navigation active. You’re running a GPS navigation program in 
the background (yay, multitasking!). Why is a special icon necessary? 
Because those GPS apps slurp down battery power like a thirsty 
golden retriever. Apple wants to make sure you don’t forget you’re 
running it.
• m Lock Rotation. This icon reminds you that you’ve deliberately 
turned off the screen-rotation feature, where the screen image turns 
90 degrees when you rotate the tablet. Why would you want to? And 
how do you turn the rotation lock on or off? See page 38.
Cameras
At the top of the 
iPad, the tiny pin-
hole is the front-
facing camera. Its 
primary purpose is 
to let you conduct 
video chats using 
the FaceTime fea-
ture, but it’s also 
handy for taking 
self-portraits or just 
checking to see if 
you have spinach in 
your teeth.
It’s not as good a camera as the one on the back, though. It’s not as good 
in low light, and takes much lower-resolution shots (1.2 megapixels).
The camera on the back of the iPad, meanwhile, takes very good photos 
indeed—8 megapixels on the iPad Air 2, 5 megapixels on the other iOS 8 
models.

The tiny pinhole next to the lens (recent models only) is a microphone. It’s 
used for recording clearer sound with video, for better noise cancellation 
on FaceTime calls, and for better directional sound pickup.
There’s more on the iPad’s cameras in Chapter 8.
Sensors
Behind the glass, front center, is a very tiny sensor. It’s hard to see.
It’s an ambient-light sensor that brightens the display when you’re in sun-
light and dims it in darker places.
Many people prefer to adjust the screen brightness themselves. Fortunately, 
it’s easy to turn off this automatic brightness-setting feature; see page 
478.
SIM Card Slot
There are two kinds of iPad: the WiFi-only models and the more expensive 
cellular + WiFi models, which can also get online anywhere there’s cellular 
coverage. You don’t have to sign up for two years of cellular service, as you 
usually do with a cellphone; on the iPad, you can sign up for a month of 
data at a time, only when you need it. (Page 351 has the details.)
On the right edge of the cellular models, there’s a pinhole next to what 
looks like a very thin slot cover. If you push an unfolded paper clip straight 
into the hole, the SIM card tray pops out.
So what’s a SIM card? 

The Guided Tour
25
Every cellphone and cellular tablet stores your account info—things like 
your carrier account details—on a tiny memory card known as a SIM (sub-
scriber identity module) card. These days, every iPad is identical; only the 
SIM card inside makes it a T-Mobile iPad, a Verizon iPad, or whatever.
So if you travel, you can rent a temporary SIM card when you get to the 
destination country. That’s a lot less expensive than paying your U.S. carr-
ier’s insane roaming fees.
The Universal Apple SIM Card
With the iPad Air 2, Apple executed a mind-blowing feat of engineer-
ing and negotiation: It created a single SIM card that works with AT&T, 
T-Mobile, and Sprint (and other carriers around the world). It’s the same 
tablet and the same SIM card, no matter which of those three companies 
you buy it from. 
In theory, Apple’s universal SIM card should mean that you can use the 
same iPad on anyone’s network. You can hop around, shop around, using 
T-Mobile when its signal is best, Sprint when its signal is best, and so on.
In reality, things work that way only if you plan to hop between Sprint and 
T-Mobile. If you ever choose an AT&T plan, the SIM becomes locked to 
AT&T forever. (And if you choose another carrier, you lose the option to 
choose AT&T in the future.)
Note, furthermore, that you get an Apple SIM only if you buy the iPad from 
Apple. If you buy it from one of the carriers, you usually get a card locked 
to the carrier. (T-Mobile is the exception.)
And Verizon, of course, refuses to play ball with Apple at all; a Verizon iPad 
has a Verizon SIM card, period. 
Headphone Jack
On the top-left edge of the iPad, there’s a miniplug. That’s where you can 
plug in earbuds (not included).
It’s more than an ordinary 3.5-millimeter audio jack, however. It contains 
a secret fourth pin that conducts sound into the tablet from the micro-
phone, if your earbuds have one on the cord. On a FaceTime audio call, for 
example, you hear the other person through your earbuds, and the mike 
on the cord picks up your voice.

Chapter 1
26
Speakers
On the bottom edge, Apple has parked another important component: 
the speakers.
The Charge/Sync Connector
Directly below the Home button, on the bottom edge of the tablet, you’ll 
find the connector that charges and syncs the iPad with your computer.
The Lightning Connector
For nearly 10 years, the charge/sync connector was identical on every 
iPad, iPod, and iPhone—the famous 30-pin connector. But on the iPad Air 
and later models, Apple replaced that inch-wide connector with a new, far 
smaller one it calls Lightning.
The Lightning connector is a great design: It clicks nicely into place (you 
can even dangle the iPad from it), yet you can yank it right out. You can 
insert the Lightning into the tablet either way—there’s no “right-side up” 
anymore. It’s much sturdier than the old connector. And it’s tiny, which was 
Apple’s primary goal—only 0.3 inches wide (the old one was almost 0.9 
inches wide).
Unfortunately, as a result, 
the latest iPads don’t fit 
a lot of existing charging 
cables, 
docks, 
chargers, 
car adapters, hotel-room 
alarm clocks, speakers, or 
accessories. 
The makers of those acces-
sories will happily sell you 
new 
models 
that 
have 
Lightning connectors. Or 
you can buy an adapter 
from Apple:
• Additional USB charging cables, like the one that came with your 
iPad, cost $20.
• A white adapter plug costs $30. It connects the modern iPad to any 
accessory that was built for the old 30-pin connector.
• If the iPad doesn’t quite fit the older accessory, sometimes the solu-
tion is the $40 adapter plug with an 8-inch cable “tail.”

In time, as the Lightning connectors come on all new iPads, iPods, and 
iPhones, a new ecosystem of accessories will arise. We’ll arrive at a new era 
of standardization—until Apple changes jacks again in another 10 years.
In the Box
Inside the minimalist box, you get the iPad and these items:
• The USB charging/syncing cable. When you connect your iPad to 
your computer using this white USB cable, it simultaneously syncs 
and charges. See Chapter 14.
• The AC adapter. When you’re traveling without a computer, you can 
plug the USB cable into the included two-prong outlet adapter, so 
you can charge the iPad directly from a wall socket.
• Decals and info card. iPad essentials.
You don’t need a copy of the iTunes software, or even a computer, to use 
the iPad—but it makes loading up the tablet a lot easier, as described in 
Chapter 14.
If you don’t have iTunes on your computer, then you can download it from 
www.apple.com/itunes.
Seven Basic Finger Techniques
The iPad isn’t quite like any machine that came before it. You do every-
thing on the touchscreen instead of with physical buttons, like this:
Tap
The iPad’s onscreen buttons are nice and big, giving your fleshy fingertip 
a fat target.
You can’t use a fingernail or a pen tip; only skin contact works. (You can 
also buy an iPad stylus. But a fingertip is cheaper and much harder to 
misplace.)
Swipe
In some situations, you’ll be asked to confirm an action by swiping your 
finger across the screen. That’s how you unlock the tablet, for example. 
You also have to swipe to confirm that you want to turn off the iPad, or to 
shut off an alarm. Swiping like this is also a great shortcut for deleting an 
email or a text message.

Chapter 1
28
Drag
When you’re zoomed into a map, Web page, email, or photo, you can scroll 
around just by sliding your finger across the glass in any direction—like a 
flick (described later), but slower and more controlled. It’s a huge improve-
ment over scroll bars, especially when you want to scroll diagonally.
Flick
A flick is a faster, less-controlled slide. You flick vertically to scroll lists on 
the iPad. The faster you flick, the faster the list spins downward or upward. 
But lists have a real-world sort of momentum; they slow down after a sec-
ond or two, so you can see where you wound up.
At any point during the scrolling of a list, you can flick again (if you didn’t 
go far enough) or tap to stop the scrolling (if you see the item you want 
to choose).

The Guided Tour
29
Pinch and Spread
In apps like Photos, Mail, Safari, and Maps, you can zoom in on a photo, 
message, Web page, or map by spreading.
That’s when you place two fingers (usually thumb and forefinger) on the 
glass and spread them. The image magically grows, as though it’s printed 
on a sheet of rubber.
Note: The English language has failed Apple here. Moving your thumb 
and forefinger closer together has a perfect verb: pinching. 
But there’s no word to describe moving them in the opposite 
direction.
Apple uses the oxymoronic expression pinch out to describe that 
move (along with the redundant-sounding pinch in). In this book, 
the opposite of “pinching” is “spreading.”
Once you’ve zoomed in like this, you can zoom out again by putting two 
fingers on the glass and pinching them together.

Chapter 1
30
Double-Tap
Double-tapping is pretty rare on the iPad, at least among the programs 
supplied by Apple. It’s generally reserved for two functions:
• In the Safari Web browser, Photos, and Maps apps, double-tapping 
zooms in on whatever you tap, magnifying it. (At that point, dou-
ble-tapping means “Restore to original size.”) Double-tapping also 
zooms into formatted email messages, PDF files, Microsoft Office files, 
and others. 
• When you’re watching a video (or recording one), double-tapping 
switches the aspect ratio (video screen shape). 
Edge Swipes
Swiping your finger inward from outside the screen has a few variations:
• From the top edge. Opens the Notification Center, which lists all your 
missed FaceTime calls and texts, appointments, and so on.
• From the bottom edge. Opens the Control Center, a unified miniature 
control panel for brightness, volume, WiFi, and so on.
• From the left edge. In many apps, this means “Go back to the pre-
vious screen.” It works in Mail, Settings, Notes, Messages, Safari, 
Facebook, and some other apps.
It sometimes makes a big difference whether you begin your swipe within 
the screen or outside it. At the Home screen, for example, starting your 
downward swipe within the screen area doesn’t open the Notification 
Center—it opens Spotlight, the iPad’s search function.
Charging the iPad
The iPad has a built-in, rechargeable battery that fills up most of its inte-
rior. How long a charge lasts depends on what you’re doing—music play-
back saps the battery the least, 3-D games sap it the most. But one thing 
is for sure: You’ll have to recharge the iPad regularly. For most people, it’s 
every couple of days.
Note: The iPad’s battery isn’t user-replaceable. It’s rechargeable, but 
after 400 or 500 charges, it starts to hold less juice. Eventually, 
you’ll have to pay Apple to install a new battery. (Apple says 
the added bulk of a protective plastic battery compartment, a 
removable door and latch, and battery-retaining springs would 
have meant a much smaller battery—or a much thicker iPad.)

The Guided Tour
31
You recharge the iPad by connecting the white USB cable that came with 
it. You can plug the far end into either of two places to supply power:
• Your computer’s USB jack. In general, the iPad charges even if 
your computer is asleep. (If it’s a laptop that itself is not plugged in, 
though, then the tablet charges only if the laptop is awake. Otherwise, 
you’d come home to a depleted laptop.)
• The AC adapter. The little white two-prong cube that came with the 
iPad connects to the end of the cradle’s USB cable—and then plugs 
into the wall.
You can usually use the iPad while it’s charging. Usually. It depends on how 
you’re charging it and how you’re using it.
A low-powered USB jack, like the one on a Windows computer or a USB 
hub, doesn’t supply enough juice to charge the tablet while you’re using it; 
you may even see a “Not charging” indication while you’re using the tablet.
The USB jack on a recent Mac should be able to charge your iPad slowly, 
even if you’re using the thing. 
The wall plug is the best of all.
What you’re doing also affects charging speed. Video games with full 
screen brightness may use up more energy than your charger is supply-
ing; simple activities, like typing or answering email, don’t consume nearly 
as much power. 
If you really want your iPad to charge quickly, then put it to sleep and plug 
it into the wall.
Battery Life Tips
The battery life of the iPad is either terrific or terrible, depending on your 
point of view. 
If you were an optimist, you’d point out that the iPad gets longer battery 
life than most rival tablets. If you were a pessimist, you’d observe that 
you sometimes can’t even make it through a single day without needing 
a recharge. 
So knowing how to scale back your iPad’s power appetite could come in 
extremely handy. 

Chapter 1
32
The biggest wolfers of electricity are the screen and the wireless features. 
Therefore, these ideas will help you squeeze more life out of each charge:
• Dim the screen. Turning down your screen saves a lot of power. The 
quickest way is to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open 
the Control Center (page 37), and then drag the brightness slider.
On a new iPad, Auto Brightness is turned on, too. In bright light, the 
screen brightens automatically; in dim light, it darkens. That’s because 
when you unlock the tablet after waking it, it samples the ambient 
light and adjusts the brightness. (You can turn this auto-brightness 
feature off altogether in SettingsÆDisplay & Brightness.)
• Turn off WiFi. If you’re not in a wireless hotspot, you may as well 
stop the thing from using its radio. Swipe up from the bottom of the 
screen to open the Control Center, and tap the ∑ icon to turn it off. 
Or at the very least tell the iPad to stop searching for WiFi networks it 
can connect to. Page 344 has the details.
• Turn off “push” data. This is a big one. Your iPad can keep itself wire-
lessly up to date with your latest email, calendar, and address book 
information. Unfortunately, all that continual sniffing of the airwaves, 
looking for updates, costs you battery power. If you can do without 
the immediacy, then visit SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆFetch 
New Data. If you turn off the Push feature and set it to Manually 
instead, then your iPad checks for email and new appointments only 
when you actually open the Mail or Calendar apps. Your battery goes 
a lot further.
• Turn off background updating. Non-Apple apps check for frequent 
updates, too: Facebook, Twitter, stock-reporting apps, and so on. Not 
all of them need to be busily toiling in the background. Your best bet 
on battery life, then, involves visiting SettingsÆGeneralÆBackground 
App Refresh and turning the switch Off for each app whose back-
ground activity isn’t strictly necessary.
• Turn off automatic app updates. App companies update their wares 
far more often than PC or Mac apps, sometimes many times a year. 
The iPad comes set to download them automatically when they 
become available. But that constant checking and downloading costs 
you battery life.
To shut that feature down, open SettingsÆiTunes & App Store. 
Scroll down to the Automatic Downloads section. Turn off Updates. 
(The other switches—Music, Apps, Books—are responsible for au-

The Guided Tour
33
to-downloading things that you or your brood have downloaded on 
other iOS gadgets. You might want to make sure they’re off, too, if 
battery life is a concern.)
• Consider Airplane mode. In Airplane mode, you shut off all the iPad’s 
power-hungry radios. Even a nearly dead iPad can hobble on for a 
few hours in Airplane mode—something to remember when you’re 
desperate. To enter Airplane mode, swipe up from the bottom of the 
screen to open the Control Center, and tap the | icon.
• Turn off Cellular Data. This option on cellular iPads (in SettingsÆ​
Cellular) turns off the cellular Internet features. You can still get online 
in a WiFi hotspot.
This feature is designed for people who have a capped data plan—a 
limited amount of Internet use per month—which is almost everybody. 
If you discover that you’ve used up almost all your data allotment for 
the month, and you don’t want to go over your limit (and thereby 
trigger an overage charge), you can use this option to shut off all 
data. Now your iPad uses less power, too.
• Turn off GPS checks. In SettingsÆPrivacyÆLocation Services, there’s 
a list of all the apps on your tablet that are using its location feature 
to know where you are. (It’s a combination of GPS, cell tower triangu-
lation, and WiFi hotspot triangulation.) All that checking uses battery 
power, too. 
Some apps, like Maps, Find My Friends, and Yelp, don’t do you much 
good unless they know your location. But plenty of apps don’t really 
need to know where you are. Facebook and Twitter, for example, want 
that information only so that they can location-stamp your posts. In 
any case, the point is to turn off Location Services for each app that 
doesn’t really need to know where you are. 
Tip: In the list of apps under Location Services, tiny ˜ icons show you 
which apps are using GPS right now (the ˜ appears in purple), and 
which have used it in the past 24 hours. These icons can help guide 
you in shutting off the GPS use of various apps.
• Turn off Bluetooth. If you’re not using a Bluetooth speaker or the 
Mac’s Handoff feature (page 453), then shut down that Bluetooth 
radio. Open the Control Center and tap the b icon to turn it off.
• Turn off the screen. You can actually turn off the screen, rendering it 
totally black and saving incredible amounts of battery power. Music 
playback and Maps navigation continue to work just fine.

Chapter 1
34
By the way, beware of 3-D games and other graphically intensive apps, 
which can be serious power hogs. And turn off EQ when playing your 
music (see page 190).
If your battery still seems to be draining faster than it should, a new iOS 8 
feature awaits you. It’s this amazing table, which shows you exactly which 
apps are using the most power:
To see it, open SettingsÆGeneralÆUsageÆBattery Usage. You can switch 
between battery readouts for the past 24 hours or for the past 4 days. 
Keep special watch for labels like these:
• Low signal. A cellular iPad uses the most power of all when it’s hunt-
ing for a cellular signal, because the tablet amplifies its radios in hopes 
of finding one. If your battery seems to be running down faster than 
usual, the “Low Signal” notation is a great clue—and a suggestion that 
maybe you should use Airplane mode when you’re on the fringes of 
cellular coverage.
• Background activity. As hinted on the previous pages, background 
Internet connections are especially insidious. These apps do online 
work invisibly, without your awareness—and drain the battery. Now, 
for the first time, you can clearly see which apps are doing it.
Once you know the culprit app, it’s easy to shut its background work 
down. Open SettingsÆGeneralÆBackground App Refresh and switch 
Off each app whose background activity isn’t strictly necessary.

The Home Screen
The Home screen is the launching pad for every iPad activity. It’s what 
appears when you press the Home button. It’s the immortal grid of color-
ful icons.
It’s such an essential landmark, in fact, that a quick tour might be helpful.
• Icons. Each icon represents one of your iPad apps (programs)—Mail, 
Maps, Camera, and so on—or a folder that you’ve made to contain 
some apps. Tap one to open that program or folder. 
The iPad comes with about 25 apps preinstalled by Apple; you can’t 
remove them. The real fun, of course, comes when you download 
more apps from the App Store (Chapter 9).
• Badges. Every now and then, you’ll see a tiny, red number “badge” 
(like @) on one of your app icons. It’s telling you that something new 
awaits: new email, new text messages, new chat entries, new updates 
for the apps on your iPad. It’s saying, “Hey, you! Tap me!” 
• Home page dots. The standard Home screen can’t hold more than 
20 or 24 icons. As you install more and more programs on your iPad, 
you’ll need more and more room for their icons. Fortunately, the iPad 
creates additional Home screens automatically. You can spread your 
new programs’ icons across 11 such launch screens. 
The little white dots are your map. Each represents one Home screen. 
If the third one is “lit up,” then you’re on the third Home screen.
To move among the screens, swipe horizontally—or tap to the right or 
left of the little dots to change screens. 
And if you ever scroll too far away from the first Home screen, here’s 
a handy shortcut: Press the Home button (yes, even though you’re 
technically already home). That takes you back to the first Home 
screen.
Tip: Note to upgraders: The very first “page,” at the far left, used to be 
the Spotlight (search) screen. But in iOS 7 and iOS 8, you open 
Spotlight by dragging down anywhere on any Home screen; there’s 
nothing to the left of the Home screens anymore. You can tug down 
on any “page” of the Home screens—you don’t have to scroll all the 
way to the left of them anymore.
• The Dock. At the bottom of the Home screen, four exalted icons sit 
in a row on a tinted panel. This is the Dock—a place to park the most 

Chapter 1
36
important icons on your iPad. These, presumably, are the ones you 
use most often. Apple starts you off with Messages, Mail, Safari, Music, 
and App Store.
What’s so special about this row? As you flip among Home screens, 
the Dock never changes. You can never lose one of your five most 
cherished icons by straying from the first page; they’re always handy.
• The background. You can replace the background image (behind 
your app icons) with a photo. A complicated, busy picture won’t do 
you any favors—it will just make the icon names harder to read—so 
Apple provides a selection of handsome, relatively subdued wallpaper 
photos. But you can also choose one of your own photos.
For instructions on changing the wallpaper, see page 244. 
It’s easy (and fun!) to rearrange the icons on your Home screens. Put the 
most frequently used icons on the first page, put similar apps into folders, 
and reorganize your Dock. Full details are on page 268.
Tip: In iOS 8, you can set up a completely empty first Home screen by 
moving all of its app icons onto other Home “pages.” (In previous 
versions of iOS, the tablet automatically deleted the first Home 
screen if it was empty.) That’s a weird little arrangement for anyone 
who wants to show off a really great wallpaper photo.

Control Center
For such a tiny device, there are an awful lot of settings you can change—
hundreds of them. Trouble is, some of them need changing (volume, 
brightness) a lot more often than others (language preference, cookie 
settings).
That’s why Apple invented the Control Center: a panel that offers quick 
access to the controls you need the most.
To open the Control Center, no matter what app you’re using, swipe 
upward from beneath the screen.
TIP: You can even open the Control Center from the Lock screen, unless 
you’ve turned off that feature (page 16).
The Control Center is a translucent gray panel filled with one-touch icons 
for the settings you’ll probably change most often. 
TIP: Truth be told, the Control Center is easier to use when it’s not 
translucent. Visit SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibility and turn on 
Increase Contrast. Now the Control Center’s background is solid 
gray instead of see-through gray.
Now, many of these settings are even faster to change using Siri, the 
voice-command feature described in Chapter 3. When it’s not socially 
awkward to speak to your tablet (like at the symphony or during a golf 
game), you can use spoken commands—listed below under each button 
description—to adjust settings without even touching the screen.

again to turn off Airplane mode.
Sample Siri command: “Turn Airplane mode on.” (Siri warns you that 
if you turn Airplane mode on, Siri herself will stop working. Say “OK.”)
• WiFi (∑). Tap to turn your tablet’s WiFi off (black) or on (white).
Sample Siri commands: “Turn off WiFi.” “Turn WiFi back on.”
• Bluetooth (b). Tap to turn your Bluetooth transmitter off (black) or 
on (white). That feature alone is a godsend to anyone who uses the 
iPad with a car’s Bluetooth audio system. Bluetooth isn’t the battery 
drain it once was, but it’s still nice to be able to flick it on so easily 
when you get into the car.
Sample Siri commands: “Turn Bluetooth on.” “Turn off Bluetooth.”
• Do Not Disturb (p). Do Not Disturb mode, described in Chapter 4, 
means that the tablet won’t ring or buzz at all—except when a few 
handpicked people are trying to reach you. Perfect for sleeping hours; 
in fact, you can set up an automated schedule for Do Not Disturb 
(say, midnight to 7 a.m.). 
But what if you wake up early or want to stay up late? Now you can 
tap to turn Do Not Disturb on (white) or off (black).
Sample Siri commands: “Turn on Do Not Disturb.” “Turn Do Not Dis-
turb off.”
• Mute (›), Lock Rotation (m). Mute (›) means your iPad won’t ring, 
chime, or beep—nothing to embarrass you in a meeting or at a funeral 
service. 
When Lock Rotation (m) is turned on (white), the screen no longer 
rotates when you turn the tablet. Sometimes, like when you’re reading 
on your side in bed, you don’t want the screen picture to turn; you 
want it to stay upright relative to your eyes. (The m icon appears at 
the top of the screen to remind you why the screen isn’t turning.)

Note: You probably have only one of these two buttons on your Control 
Center—and you decide which.
Most iPad models have a physical switch on the right edge. It 
can be either Mute or Lock Rotation; you make your choice in 
Settings (see page 39). 
Whichever function you don’t assign to the side switch appears 
in the Control Center, for your convenience. If you’ve set your side 
switch to mean Mute, then the m button appears in the Control 
Center, and vice versa.
The iPad Air 2 doesn’t have a physical switch on the right edge. 
So on this mode, both buttons—› and m—appear in the Control 
Center.
• Brightness. Hallelujah! Here’s a screen-brightness slider. Drag the little 
white ball to change the screen brightness.
Sample Siri commands: “Make the screen brighter.” “Decrease the 
brightness.” “Dim the screen.” “Brighten up!”
• Playback controls ( «, ÷, » ). These controls govern playback in 
whatever app is playing music or podcasts in the background: the 
Music app, Pandora, Spotify, whatever it is. You can skip a horrible 
song quickly and efficiently without having to interrupt what you’re 
doing, or pause the music to chat with a colleague. (Tap the song 
name to open whatever app is playing.)
You also get a scrubber bar that shows where you are in the song, 
the name of the song and the performer, and the album name. And, 
of course, there’s a volume slider. It lets you make big volume jumps 
faster than you would by pressing the volume buttons on the side of 
the tablet.
Sample Siri commands: “Pause the music.” “Skip to the next song.” 
“Play some Billy Joel.” 
• AirDrop ([). AirDrop gives you a quick, effortless way to shoot pho-
tos, maps, Web pages, and other stuff to nearby iPads, iPhones, iPod 
Touches, and even Macs. (See page 515 for details.)
On the Control Center, the AirDrop button isn’t an on/off switch like 
most of the other icons here. Instead it produces a pop-up menu of 
options that control whose i-gadgets can “see” your iPad: Contacts 
Only (people in your address book), Everyone, or Off (nobody).
• AirPlay (Ò). The AirPlay button lets you send your iPad’s video and 
audio to a wireless speaker system or TV—if you have an AirPlay 

Chapter 1
40
receiver, of which the most famous is the Apple TV. Details are on 
page 190.
• Timer (ˇ). Tap to open the Clock app—specifically, the Timer mode, 
which counts down to zero. Apple figures you might appreciate hav-
ing direct access to it when you’re cooking, for example, or waiting for 
your hair color to set.
Sample Siri commands: “Open the Timer.” Or, better yet, bypass the 
Clock and Timer apps altogether: “Start the timer for three minutes.” 
“Count down from six minutes.” (Siri counts down right there on the 
Siri screen.)
• Camera (s). Tap to jump directly into the Camera app. Because 
photo ops don’t wait around.
Sample Siri commands: “Take a picture.” “Open the camera.”
The Control Center closes when any of these things happen:
• 	You tap the Timer or Camera button
• 	You tap the o button 
• 	You tap or drag downward from any spot above the Control Center 
(the dimmed background of the screen).
• 	You press the Home button.
NOTE:: In some apps, swiping up doesn’t open the Control Center on the 
first try, much to your probable bafflement. Instead, swiping up 
just makes a tiny O tab appear at the edge of the screen. (You’ll 
see this behavior whenever the status bar—the strip at the top 
that shows the time and battery gauge—is hidden, as can happen 
in the full-screen modes of iBooks, Maps, Videos, and so on. It 
also happens in the Camera.)
In those situations, Apple is trying to protect you from opening 
the Control Center accidentally— for example, when what you 
really wanted to do was scroll the image up. No big deal; once 
the O appears, swipe up a second time to open the Control 
Center panel.
If you find yourself opening the Control Center accidentally—when playing 
games, for example—you can turn it off. Open SettingsÆControl Center. 
Turn off Access Within Apps. Now swiping up opens the Control Center 
only at the Home screen. (You can also turn off Access on Lock Screen 
here, to make sure the Control Center never appears when the tablet is 
asleep.)

Notifications 
A notification is an important status message. You get one every time a 
message comes in, an alarm goes off, a calendar appointment is imminent, 
or your battery is running low.
Responding to Notifications
These days, there’s a lot more you can do with a notification than just read 
it and nod OK. Apple has gone to a lot of effort to ensure that notifications 
disrupt your important tablet activities as rarely as possible. So:
• Flick it away. When a notification appears at the top of the screen, it’s 
sometimes covering up whatever you were doing. If you wait a couple 
of seconds, the message goes away by itself. But you don’t have to 
wait. You can just flick it upward with your finger to make it disappear.
• Answer it. Often, a notification displays an incoming text message, 
email, or calendar invitation. In iOS 8, you can swipe down on it to 
reveal buttons that let you take action: Reply, for example, or Decline 
and Accept (for an invitation). And you never have to leave the app 
you were using, which is deliciously efficient.
Tip: This trick works even on the Lock screen. That is, you can respond 
to something even without unlocking the tablet.
• Open it. Finally, the obvious one: You can tap a notification to open 
the app it came from. Tap an email notification to open the message 
in Mail; tap a message notification to open it in Messages; and so on. 

Chapter 1
42
That’s handy when you want to dig in and see the full context of the 
notification.
The Notification Center
No matter what kind of notification pops up, you still see only one alert at 
a time. And once it’s gone, you can’t get it back. Or can you?
Meet the Notification Center screen. It lists every notification you’ve 
recently received, in a tidy, scrolling list. 
You can check it out right now: Swipe down from above the iPad’s screen. 
The Notification Center pulls down like a classy window shade, printed in 
white with every recent item of interest.
Here you’ll find all your apps’ notifications, as well as your recent mes-
sages, reminders, and upcoming calendar appointments.

The Guided Tour
43
You can inspect two different lists here (a redesign in iOS 8):
• Today. The Today screen presents an executive summary of every-
thing you need to know today, in plain English: your upcoming 
appointments (“ ‘Salary meeting’ is next up on your calendar, at 
2 PM”); reminders coming due; weather and stock information; and a 
preview of your schedule tomorrow. If you’re away from your home or 
office, you’ll even see an estimated commuting time, based on current 
traffic conditions. Pretty slick.
In iOS 8, the Today screen has become a much bigger deal. Apple 
now allows apps to add their own sections to the Today list. 
For example, Dropbox can show a list of files that have been added 
to your Dropbox folder; Evernote can add buttons for creating new 
notes or reminders; The New York Times, Yahoo Digest, and Huffing-
ton Post apps can add headlines; Yahoo Weather can add weather 
information, including a photo of current conditions; the Kindle app 
offers links to the books you’re reading right now; and so on.
To manage all of this, scroll down to the bottom of the Today list and 
tap Edit. In the resulting list, you can tap – to remove a module from 

Chapter 1
44
the Today list, drag the ˝ up or down to move it higher or lower in 
the list, or tap ≠ to add a module. Then tap Done.
• Notifications. On this tab, you see every notification you’ve received, 
sorted by app: all the FaceTime calls, texts, and other notifications 
that came in while your tablet was asleep or turned off. (They disap-
pear after a day.) It can be a very long list. 
Tap a line in the Notification Center to open the relevant app for more 
details—for example, to see more information about that appoint-
ment, or to read the whole message in context.
Tap the ˛ next to an app’s name, and then tap Clear to remove that 
app’s current listings from the Notification Center—for now. That 
app’s heading will reappear the next time it has anything to tell you.
And if you see an email message or a text message, drag left across 
it to reveal handy instant buttons: Reply, Mark as Read, Archive, or 
Delete, for example (as shown in the illustration on page 42).
Tip: To switch between the Today and Notification views, you can tap 
the tabs or just swipe across the screen.
To close the Notification Center, press the Home button or drag the bot-
tom handle (O) upward. (Actually, you don’t have to aim for the handle. 
You can just swipe upward from beneath the screen, quickly and sloppily.)
Customizing Notifications
You can (and should) specify which apps are allowed to junk up your 
Notification Center. Open SettingsÆNotifications to see the master list 
(shown on page 46), with one entry for every app that might ever want 
your attention. (Or just tell Siri, “Open notification settings.”)
Under Notifications View, you can specify the order of the various apps’ 
notifications in the center. If you tap Sort By Time, then the apps with the 
newest alerts appear at the top. But if you tap Sort Manually and then Edit, 
you can drag the H handles up or down to specify the order of your apps’ 
notifications on the Notification Center screen.
The most important work you can do in Notifications settings, though, is 
to control the behavior of each individual app. You’ll quickly discover that 
every app thinks it’s important; every app wants its notifications to blast 
into your face when you’re working. 

The Guided Tour
45
You, however, may disagree. You may not consider it essential to know 
when your kid’s Plants vs. Zombies game score has changed, for example.
So: Tap an app’s name to open its individual Notifications screen (at right 
on the next page—the Messages app, in this example). Here you’ll find set-
tings that vary by app, but they generally run along these lines:
• Allow Notifications. If you don’t want this app to make any notifica-
tions pop up at all, then turn this off. 
• Show in Notification Center. How many recent notifications from 
this app are allowed to appear in your Notification Center? You can 
choose anything from No Recent Items (the app can still get your 
attention with banners or alert bubbles—but it won’t appear in the 
Notification Center) to 10 Recent Items (for really important things 
like emails).
• Sounds. Some apps try to get your attention with a sound effect 
when a notification appears. Turn this off if you think your tablet 
makes too many beeps and burbles as it is.
• Notification Sound. Some apps offer this control. It lets you choose 
which sound effect plays to get your attention. You can change the 
sound or choose None.
• Badge App Icon. A badge is a little red circled number (@, for exam-
ple). It appears right on an app’s icon to indicate how many updates 
are waiting for you. Turn it off if you really don’t need that reminder.
• Show on Lock Screen. The Lock screen (page 13) is another place 
to see what’s been trying to get your attention while the tablet was in 
your bag: new messages and email, Facebook updates, and so on. 
The Lock screen may seem just like the Notification Center—but there 
are differences. For example, each time you wake the tablet, whatever 
notifications are on the Lock screen are wiped clear. They don’t stay 
put, as they do on the Notification Center.
You might want a different set of apps to list their nags on the Lock 
screen. Maybe you want the Lock screen to show only new text mes-
sages and new mail—but you’d like the Notification Center to be fully 
stocked with Twitter and Facebook updates, for example. Or maybe 
you’d rather not permit passing evildoers to pick up your tablet and 
see your notifications without even having to unlock it.

Chapter 1
46
That’s why you have this switch. It governs your ability to see this 
app’s updates on the Lock screen (and the Notification Center when 
you open it while at the Lock screen).
What Notifications Look Like
Notifications can appear in any of three styles—and you get to choose 
which you prefer, for each app. 

The Guided Tour
47
On the same screen described above (open SettingsÆNotifications and 
tap the app’s name), you can choose one of these three styles:
• None. If a certain app bugs you with news you really don’t care about, 
you can shut it up forever. Tap None.
• Banners are incoming notifications that appear quietly and briefly 
at the top of the screen (below, top). The message holds still long 
enough for you to read it, but it doesn’t interrupt your work and goes 
away after a few seconds. Banners are a good option for things like 
Facebook and Twitter updates and incoming email messages.
Tip: A reminder: If you tap a banner before it disappears, you jump 
directly to the app that’s trying to get your attention. You can also 
flick a banner up off the screen if it’s in your way.
• Alerts. A white alert box appears, center screen, to get your attention 
(above, bottom). You might use this option for apps whose messages 
are too important to miss, like alarms, flight updates, and messages.

Chapter 1
48
Tip: You can also use the Include setting to specify how much of the 
Notification Center this app is allowed to use up—that is, how many 
lines of information. Maybe you need only the most recent alert 
about your upcoming flight (1 Item), but you want to see a lot more 
of your upcoming appointments (10 Items).
Miscellaneous Weirdness
As you poke around in the Notification Center settings, you’ll discover that 
certain oddball apps offer some options that don’t match up with the set-
tings you see for most apps. Don’t freak out. It’s all part of Apple’s master 
plan to put controls where it hopes you’ll find them. 
Password (or Fingerprint) Protection
About half of iPad owners don’t bother setting up a password to protect 
the tablet. Maybe they never set the thing down in public, so they don’t 
worry about thieves. Or maybe there’s just not that much personal infor-
mation on the tablet—and, meanwhile, having to enter a password every 
single time you wake the tablet gets to be a hassle.
TIP: Besides—if you ever do lose your tablet, you can put a password on 
it by remote control; see page 439.
The other half of people reason that the inconvenience of entering a pass-
word many times a day is a small price to pay for the knowledge that 
nobody can get into your stuff if you lose it.
If you think your tablet is worth protecting, here’s how to set up a pass-
word—and, if you have an iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3, how to use the finger-
print reader instead.
Setting Up a Password
If you didn’t already create a tablet password the first time you turned 
your iPad on, here’s how to do it. (And just because you’re an Air 2 or 
mini 3 owner, don’t be smug; you have to create a password even if you 
plan to use the fingerprint reader. As a backup.)
Open SettingsÆTouch ID & Passcode. (On pre-2014 models, it’s just called 
Passcode Lock.)
You can set up either a four-digit number—convenient, but not so impos-
sible to guess—or a full-blown alphanumeric password of any length. You 
decide, using the Simple Passcode on/off switch.

The Guided Tour
49
Now tap Turn Passcode On. You’re asked to type the password you want, 
either on the number keypad (for Simple Passcodes) or the alphabet key-
board. You’re asked to do it again to make sure you didn’t make a typo.
Note: Don’t kid around with this passcode. If you forget the iPad code, 
you’ll have to restore your iPad (page 513), which wipes 
out everything on it. You’ve still got most of the data on your 
computer, of course (music, video, contacts, calendar), but you 
may lose text messages, mail, and so on.
Once you confirm your password, you return to the Passcode Lock 
screen. Here you have a few more options.
For example, the Require Passcode option lets you specify how 
quickly the password is requested before locking somebody out: 
immediately after the iPad wakes or 1, 15, 30, 60, or 240 minutes 
later. (Those options are a convenience to you, so you can quickly 

Chapter 1
50
check your calendar or missed messages without having to enter the 
passcode—while still protecting your data from, for example, evildoers 
who pick up your iPad while you’re out getting coffee.)
Certain features are accessible on the Lock screen even before you’ve 
entered your password: the Today and Notifications tabs of the Noti-
fication Center, and Siri. These are huge conveniences , but also, tech-
nically, a security risk. Somebody who finds your tablet on your desk 
could, for example, look up your schedule or use Siri to send a text. If 
you turn these switches off, then nobody can use these features with-
out entering the password (or using your fingerprint).
Finally, here is Erase Data—an option that’s scary and reassuring at 
the same time. When this option is on, then if someone makes 10 
incorrect guesses at your passcode, your iPad erases itself. It’s assum-
ing that some lowlife burglar is trying to crack into it to have a look at 
all your personal data. 
This option, a pertinent one for professional people, presents potent 
protection from patient password prospectors.
And that is all. From now on, each time you wake your iPad (if it’s not 
within the window of repeat visits you established), you’re asked for your 
password.
Fingerprint Security (Touch ID)
If you have an iPad Air 2 or mini 3—you lucky thing—you have the option 
of using a more secure and much more convenient kind of “password”: 
your fingertip. 
The lens built right into the Home button (clever!) actually works—every 
time. It’s not fussy, it’s not balky. It reads your finger at any angle. It can’t be 
faked out by a plastic finger or even a chopped-off finger. You can teach 
it to recognize up to five fingerprints; they can all be yours, or some can 
belong to other people you trust.
Before you can use your fingertip as a password, though, you have to 
teach the tablet to recognize it. Here’s how that goes:
1.	 Create a passcode. That’s right: You can’t use a fingerprint instead of 
a password; you can only use a fingerprint in addition to one. You’ll 
still need a password from time to time to keep the tablet’s security 
tight. For example, you need to enter your password if you can’t make 
your fingerprint work (maybe it got encased in acrylic in a hideous 
crafts accident), or if you restart the tablet, or if you haven’t used the 
tablet in 48 hours or more.

The Guided Tour
51
So open SettingsÆTouch ID & Passcode and create a password, as 
described on the previous pages.
2.	 Teach a fingerprint. At the top of the Touch ID & Passcode screen, 
you see the on/off switches for the three things your fingerprint can 
do: It can unlock the tablet (iPad Unlock), buy things online from 
within shopping apps (Apple Pay), and serve as your password when 
you buy books, music, apps, and videos from Apple’s online stores 
(iTunes & App Store).
But what you really want to tap here, of course, is Add a fingerprint. 
Now comes the cool part. Place the finger you want to train onto the 
Home button—your thumb or index finger are the most logical can-
didates. Touch it to the Home button over and over, maybe six times. 
Each time, the gray lines of the onscreen fingerprint darken a little 
more.
Once you’ve filled in the fingerprint, you see the Adjust Your Grip 
screen. Tap Continue. Now the iPad wants you to touch the Home 
button another few times, this time tipping the finger a little each time 
so the sensor gets a better view of your finger’s edges.
Once that’s done, the screen says “Success!” 
You are now ready to start using your fingerprint. Try it: Put the tablet to 
sleep. Then wake it (press the Sleep switch or press the Home button), and 

Chapter 1
52
then leave your finger on the Home button for about a second. The tablet 
reads your fingerprint and instantly unlocks itself.
And now, a few notes about using your fingerprint as a password:
• 	Yes, you can touch your finger to the Home button at the Lock 
screen. But you can also touch it at any Enter Passcode screen. 
Suppose, for example, that your Lock screen shows that you missed a 
text message. And you want to reply. Well, you can swipe across that 
notification to open it in its native habitat—the Messages app—but 
first you’re shown the Enter Passcode screen. Ignore that. Just touch 
the Home button with the finger whose print you recorded.
• 	Apple says the image of your fingerprint is encrypted and stored in 
the iPad’s processor chip. It’s never transmitted anywhere, it never 
goes online, and it’s never collected by Apple.
• 	If you return to the Touch ID & Passcode screens, you can tap Add a 
Fingerprint again to teach your tablet to recognize a second finger. 
And a third, fourth, and fifth. 
The five “registered” fingerprints don’t all have to belong to you. If 
you share the tablet with a spouse or a child, for example, that special 
somebody can use up some of the fingerprint slots.
• 	To rename a fingerprint, tap its current name (“Finger 1” or whatever). 
To delete one, tap its name and then tap Delete Fingerprint. (You can 
figure out which finger label is which by touching the Home button; 
the corresponding label blinks. Sweet!)
• 	You can register your toes instead of fingers, if that’s helpful. Or even 
patches of your wrist or arm, if you’re patient (and weird).
• 	The Touch ID scanner may have trouble recognizing your finger if it 
(your finger) is wet, greasy, or scarred.
• 	The iPad’s finger reader isn’t just a camera; it doesn’t just look for the 
image of your fingerprint. It’s actually measuring the tiny differences 
in electrical conductivity between the raised parts of your finger-
print (which aren’t conductive) and the skin just beneath the surface 
(which is). That’s why a plastic finger won’t work—and even your own 
finger won’t work if it’s been chopped off (or if you’ve passed away).
Fingerprints for Apps, Web Sites, and Apple Pay
So if your fingerprint is such a great solution to password overload, how 
come it works only to unlock the tablet and to buy stuff from Apple’s 
online stores? Wouldn’t it be great if your fingerprint could also log you 
into secure Web sites? Or serve as your ID when you buy stuff online? 

The Guided Tour
53
In iOS 8, that dream has become a reality. Software companies can now 
use your Touch ID fingerprint to log into their apps. Mint (for checking 
your personal finances), Evernote (for storing notes, pictures, and to-do 
lists), Amazon (for buying stuff), and other apps now permit you to sub-
stitute a fingerprint touch for typing a password.
What’s really wild is that password-storing apps like 1Password and 
LastPass have been updated, too. Those apps are designed to memorize 
your passwords for all sites on the Web, of every type—and now you can 
use your fingerprint to unlock them.
Moreover, your fingerprint is now the key to the magical door of Apple Pay, 
the buy-with-your-fingerprint technology described on page 445.
All of this is great news. Most of us would be happy if we never, ever had 
to type in another password.

A
s a tablet computer, the iPad faces a fundamental limitation: It 
has no real keyboard or mouse. Which might be considered a 
drawback on a gadget that’s capable of running hundreds of 
thousands of programs. 
Fortunately, where there’s a problem, there’s software that can fix it. The 
modern iPad’s virtual keyboard is smart in all kinds of ways—automati-
cally predicting words and correcting typos, for example. And, hey, this is 
iOS 8; if you don’t like the iPad’s onscreen keyboard, you can just choose 
one designed by a different company. 
This chapter covers every aspect of working with text on the iPad: enter-
ing it, fixing it, dictating it, and searching for it. 
The Keyboard
The iPad has no physical keys. A virtual keyboard, therefore, is the only 
possible built-in system for typing text. Like it or not, you’ll be doing a lot 
of typing on glass.
The keyboard appears automatically whenever you tap in a place where 
typing is possible: in an outgoing email, in the Notes app, in the address 
bar of the Web browser, and so on.
Just tap the key you want. It doesn’t darken or light up to confirm that 
you’ve typed something, but you may hear a little key-tap sound, and, of 
course, whatever character you typed appears on the screen.
In darker gray, surrounding the letters, you’ll find these special keys:
• Shift (L). When you tap this key, it turns dark to indicate that it’s in 
effect. The next letter you type appears as a capital. Then the L key 
returns to normal, meaning that the next letter will be lowercase.
Typing, Editing 
& Searching

Chapter 2
56
Tip: The iPad has a Caps Lock “key,” too, but it’s hidden. To engage it, 
double-tap the L key; it changes to Ç. You’re now in Caps Lock 
mode, and you’ll now type in ALL CAPITALS until you tap the Ç 
key again. (If you can’t seem to make Caps Lock work, try double-
tapping the L key fast. Or see if maybe Caps Lock got turned off in 
SettingsÆGeneralÆKeyboard.)
• Backspace (V). This key actually has three speeds.
Tap it once to delete the letter just before the blinking insertion 
point.
Hold it down to “walk” backward, deleting as you go. 
If you hold the key down long enough, it starts deleting words 
rather than letters, one whole chunk at a time.
• .?123. Tap this button when you want to type numbers or punctua-
tion. The keyboard changes to offer a palette of numbers and sym-
bols. Tap the same key—which now says —to return to the letters 
keyboard. 
Once you’re on the numbers/symbols pad, a new dark-gray button 
appears, labeled =. Tapping it summons a third keyboard layout, 
containing the less frequently used symbols, like brackets, the # and 
% symbols, bullets, and math symbols.
Note: Because the period is such a frequently used symbol, there’s 
an awesome shortcut that doesn’t require switching to the 
punctuation keyboard: At the end of a sentence, tap the space 
bar twice. You get a period, a space, and a capitalized letter at 
the beginning of the next word. (This, too, can be turned off—in 
SettingsÆGeneralÆKeyboard—although it’s hard to imagine why 
you’d want to.)

Typing, Editing & Searching

• return. Tapping this key moves to the next line, just as on a real key-
board. (There’s no Tab key or Enter key in iPad Land.)
Making the Keyboard Work
Some people have no problem tapping those virtual keys; others struggle 
for days. Either way, here are some tips:
• 	Don’t be dismayed by the smaller-than-standard keys.
As you type, use the whole pad of your finger or thumb. Don’t try to 
tap with only a skinny part of your finger to match the smallish keys. 
You’ll be surprised at how fast and accurate this method is. (Tap, 
don’t press.)
• 	This may sound like New Age hooey, but trust the keyboard. Don’t 
pause to check the result after each letter. Just plow on.
Tip: Although you don’t see it, the sizes of the keys on the iPad keyboard 
are changing all the time. That is, the software enlarges the “landing 
area” of certain keys, based on probability.
For example, suppose you type tim. The iPad knows that no word in 
the language begins with timw or timr—and so, invisibly, it enlarges 
the “landing area” of the E key, which greatly diminishes your 
chances of making a typo on that last letter.
• 	Without cursor keys, how are you supposed to correct an error you 
made a few sentences ago? Easy—use the loupe.
Hold your fingertip down anywhere in the text until the magnified 
circle appears. Without lifting your finger, drag anywhere in the text; 
the insertion point moves along with it. Release when the blue line 
is where you want to delete or add text, just as though you’d clicked 
there with a mouse.

Tip: In the Safari address bar, you can skip the part about waiting for the 
loupe to appear. Once you click into the address, start dragging to 
make it appear at once.
• 	Don’t bother using the Shift key to capitalize a new sentence. The 
iPad does that capitalizing automatically. (To turn this feature on or 
off, open SettingsÆGeneralÆKeyboard. Turn off Auto-Capitalization.)
• 	You can save time by leaving out the apostrophe in contractions. Type 
im, dont, or cant. The iPad proposes I’m, don’t, or can’t, so you can 
just tap the space bar to fix the word and continue.
• 	In time, you can learn to type two-handed, as on a laptop. Since you 
can’t feel the keys (and they’re smaller than a laptop’s) it’s not as fast. 
But it beats hunting and pecking with one finger as on a phone.
• 	If you’re a two-thumbs typist, you’ll like this tip. 
Unless you’re a concert pianist, your thumbs probably aren’t long 
enough to reach all of the keys. But try this: Put your thumbs on 
the keyboard and pull them apart. The keyboard splits in half and 
shrinks. The result: a split keyboard whose keys are all thumb-reach-
able on both sides.
To restore the original keyboard, just push inward on both halves 
simultaneously.

QuickType
The typing experience in iOS 8 is drastically different, thanks to what Apple 
calls its QuickType keyboard. It saves you a lot of time, tapping, and errors.
The idea is simple: As you type a sentence, the software predicts which 
word you might type next—which are the three most likely, actually—and 
displays them as three buttons above the keyboard. 
If you begin the sentence by typing, “I really,” then the three suggestions 
might be want, don’t, and like. 
But what if you intended to say, “I really hope…”? In that case, type the first 
letter of “hope.” Instantly, the three suggestions change to “h,” hope, and 
hate. (The first button always shows, in quotes, whatever non-word you’ve 
typed so far, just in case that’s what you really intend. To place it into your 
text, you can tap that button or tap the space bar or some punctuation.) 
In other words, QuickType is autocomplete on steroids. Frankly, it’s a rush 
when QuickType correctly proposes finishing a long word for you.
With QuickType, you can produce a sentence like “I’ll gladly pay you 
Tuesday for a hamburger today” with 26 taps on the screen. If you had to 
type out the whole thing, you’d have tapped 50 keys. QuickType also adds 
spaces for you.
A set of three buttons guessing what you might want to type next isn’t 
a new idea; Android and BlackBerry phones have had it for years. But 
QuickType is smarter in several ways:
• 	QuickType’s suggestions are different in Messages (where language 
tends to be casual) than in Mail (where people write more formally). 
• 	Similarly, QuickType modifies its suggestions based on whom you’re 
writing to. It learns.

Chapter 2
60
• 	You can hide the QuickType bar if it’s getting on your nerves. Just 
swipe down on it with your finger; you’ll see it collapse into a horizon-
tal white line. (To bring it back, swipe up on the white line.) 
• 	Sometimes, QuickType offers you several words on a single button, to 
save you even more time (for example, up to or in the). 
• 	QuickType automatically adds a space after each word you select, so 
you don’t have to mess with the space bar. 
• 	When someone texts you a question that ends with a choice (“Coffee, 
tea, or me?”), the QuickType buttons cleverly offer those choices on 
the buttons. Before you’ve even typed a single letter, the choices say 
coffee, tea, and you.
Tip: If you forget to capitalize a word, double-tap to select it. Now tap 
Shift once (To Initial Cap The Word) or twice (FOR ALL CAPS). 
Lo and behold, the QuickType suggestions are now capitalized 
renditions of the word, ready to replace it!  
QuickType does mean that you have to split your focus. You have to 
pay attention to both the keys you’re tapping and the ever-changing 
word choices above the keyboard. With practice, though, you’ll find that 
QuickType offers impressive speed and accuracy. You won’t miss the little 
autocorrect bubbles of old. 
Tip: But if you do, you can turn QuickType off. Open SettingsÆ​GeneralÆ​
Keyboard, and turn off Predictive.

The Spelling Checker
Here’s the world’s friendliest typo-fixer. Apple calls it a spelling checker, 
but maybe that’s stretching it. 
The idea is that anytime the iPad doesn’t recognize something you’ve 
typed, it draws a dotted red underline beneath it. Tap the word to see a pop-
up balloon with one, two, or three alternate spellings. Often, one of them 
is what you wanted, and you can tap it to fix the mistake. (Equally often, 
none of them is, and it’s time to break out the loupe and the keyboard.)
Tip: You can also invoke the spelling checker’s suggestions even if you 
haven’t made a typo. Double-tap the word; on the editing bar that 
appears, tap Replace.
The Spelling Dictionary
If you start typing a word the iPad doesn’t recognize, the first of the three 
suggestion buttons displays your word in quotation marks.
If you really do intend to type that nonstandard word, tap its button. You’ve 
just allowed the “mistake” to stand—and you’ve added it to the iPad’s cus-
tom, dynamic dictionary. The tablet assumes that you’ve just typed some 
name, bit of slang, or terminology that wasn’t in its dictionary originally. 
From now on, it will accept that bizarre new word as a legitimate word—
and, in fact, will even suggest it the next time you start typing it.
Tip: If you feel you’ve really made a mess of your custom dictionary, 
and the iPad keeps suggesting ridiculous alternate words, 
you can always start fresh. From the Home screen, tap 
SettingsÆGeneralÆReset, and then tap Reset Keyboard Dictionary. 
Now the iPad’s dictionary is the way it was when it came from the 
factory, without any of the words it learned from you.

The Widescreen Keyboard
In most apps, you can turn the tablet 90 degrees to type. When the key-
board stretches out the long way, the keys get a lot bigger. You may find 
it easier to type.
This feature doesn’t work in every app, but it does work in the apps where 
you do the most typing: Mail, Messages, the Safari browser, Contacts, 
Notes, and so on. (The screen also rotates in Camera, Music, Calculator, 
Calendar, and Stocks, though not for typing purposes.)
Punctuation and Numbers with One Touch
On the iPad, the alphabet keys and most punctuation keys appear on two 
different keyboard layouts. That’s a hassle, because each time you want, 
say, an @ sign, it’s an awkward, three-step dance: (1) Tap the „ key to get 
the punctuation layout. (2) Tap the @. (3) Tap the  key or the space 
bar to return to the alphabet layout.
Fortunately, there’s a secret way to get a symbol (numbers, slash, hyphen, 
semicolon, dollar sign, etc.) with only a single finger gesture. The iPad 
doesn’t register most key presses until you lift your finger. But the Shift 
and Punctuation keys register their taps on the press down instead.
So here’s what you can do, all in one motion:
1.	 Touch the .?123 key, but don’t lift your finger. The punctuation layout 
appears.
2.	 Slide your finger onto the number or symbol key you want and 
release. The  layout returns automatically. You’ve typed a symbol 
or number with one finger touch instead of three. 
Tip: If you’re a two-thumbed typist, you can also hit the „ key with 
your left thumb and then tap the punctuation key with your right. 
It even works on the = sub-punctuation layout, although you’ll 
probably visit that screen less often.

Typing, Editing & Searching
63
In fact, you can type any of the punctuation symbols the same way. This 
technique makes a huge difference in the usability of the keyboard.
Tip: This same trick saves you a finger-press when capitalizing words, 
too. You can put your finger down on the L key and slide directly 
onto the letter you want to type in its uppercase version. Or, if 
you’re a two-handed iPad typist, you can work the Shift key like the 
one on your computer: Hold it down with your left thumb, type a 
letter with your right, and then release both.
Accented Characters
To produce an accented character (like é, ë, è, ê, and so on), keep your fin-
ger pressed on that key for 1 second. A palette of diacritical marks appears; 
slide onto the one you want.

Typing Shortcuts (Abbreviation Expanders)
Here’s a feature that nobody ever talks about—probably because nobody 
even knows it exists. But it’s a huge time- and sanity-saver; for a gadget 
with no physical keys, anything that can do your typing for you is very wel-
come indeed.
You can program your tablet to expand abbreviations that you type. Set 
up addr to type your entire mailing address, or eml to type out your email 
address. Create two-letter abbreviations for big legal or technical words 
you have to type a lot. Set up goaway to type out a polite rejection para-
graph for use in email. And so on.
This feature has been in Microsoft Office forever (called AutoCorrect). And 
it’s always been available as a separate app (TypeIt4Me and TextExpander, 
for example—but because they were separate, you had to copy your 

Typing, Editing & Searching
65
expanded text, switch to the target program, and then paste). But since 
it’s now built right into the operating system, it works anywhere you can 
type.
You build your list of abbreviations in SettingsÆGeneralÆKeyboardÆ 
Shortcuts. Tap the n button. On the resulting screen, type the expanded 
text into the Phrase box. (It can be very long, but it all has to be one con-
tinuous blob of text; it can’t contain Returns.) In the Shortcut box, type the 
abbreviation you want to trigger the phrase. 
TIP: The Shortcut box says “Optional.” You might wonder: Why would 
you leave the shortcut blank? Then your new shortcut will be 
un-triggerable and pointless.
Not quite. It’s optional to enable a sneaky trick: to make the 
tablet stop mis-replacing some word (for example, insisting 
that you mean PTA when you type pta, a new chemical you’ve 
designed).
In that case, type your phrase into the Phrase box, but leave 
Shortcut blank. 
That’s it! Now, whenever you type one of the abbreviations you’ve set up, 
the iPad proposes replacing it with your substituted text.

Swype, SwiftKey, and Other Keyboards
This new iOS 8 feature is a really big deal: You’re no longer stuck with 
Apple’s onscreen keyboard. You can, for the first time, install virtual key-
boards from other companies. (Hey—just like on Android devices!)
Many people swear that these rival keyboard systems are superior to the 
standard iOS 8 keyboard in speed and accuracy. In particular, people like 
keyboards like Swype; in these systems, you don’t have to tap each key to 
spell out a word. Instead, you rapidly and sloppily drag your finger across 
the glass, hitting the letters you want and lifting your finger at the end of a 
word. The software figures out which word you were going for.
Sounds bizarre, but it’s fast and very satisfying. And pretty; your finger 
leaves a sort of fire trail as it slides across the glass.
These keyboards generally incorporate their own versions of QuickType—
that is, they offer three predictions about the word you’re going to type 
next. 
Most don’t vary their predictions depending on the person you’re writing 
to or which app you’re using, as iOS 8’s predictions do. But they do offer 
other impressive features; for example, SwiftKey can sync what it’s learned 
to your other gadgets (iOS 8 doesn’t do that; it learns, but its education is 
locked on your iPad). 
Then there are Fleksy, TouchPal, KuaiBoard, and a raft of others. 

Typing, Editing & Searching
67
Note, however, that none of them offer a ß button. Apple doesn’t allow 
them access to Siri, so you can’t use voice dictation when one of these 
keyboards is on the screen. And, sometimes, you can’t use these alternate 
keyboards for typing into Password boxes.
Otherwise, these alternate keyboard systems are fascinating and, often, 
better and faster than Apple’s. Many are free, so they’re well worth 
ex­ploring.
To install an alternate keyboard, download it from the App Store (page 
66).
Then go to SettingsÆGeneralÆKeyboardÆKeyboards. When you tap Add 
New Keyboard, you’ll see your newly downloaded keyboard’s name. Turn 
it on by tapping it.
Now, when you arrive at any writing area in any app, you’ll discover that 
a new icon has appeared on the keyboard: a tiny globe (˚) next to the 
space bar. Tap it. The keyboard changes to the new one you installed. 
(Each tap on the ˚ button summons the next keyboard you’ve installed—
or you can hold your finger down on it for a pop-up list.) 
International Typing
Because the iPad is sold around the world, it has to be equipped for nonEn-
glish languages—and even non-Roman alphabets. Fortunately, it’s ready.
To prepare the iPad for language switching, go to SettingsÆGeneralÆ​
Language & Region. Tap iPad Language to set the iPad’s primary language 
(for menus, button labels, and so on).
To make other keyboards available, go to SettingsÆGeneralÆKeyboardÆ​
Keyboards, tap Add New Keyboard, and then turn on the keyboard lay-
outs you’ll want available: Russian, Italian, whatever. 
If you choose Japanese or Chinese, you’re offered the chance to specify 
which kind of character input you want. For Japanese, you can choose a 
QWERTY layout (Romaji) or a Kana keypad. For Simplified or Traditional 
Chinese, your choices include the Pinyin input method (which uses a 
QWERTY layout) or handwriting recognition, where you draw your sym-
bols onto the screen with your fingertip; a palette of potential interpre-
tations appears to the right. (That’s handy, since there are thousands of 
characters in Chinese, and you’d need a 65-inch iPad to fit the keyboard.) 
Or hey—it’s a free tic-tac-toe game!
As described in the previous section, a new key has now appeared on the 
keyboard: ˚ next to the space bar. Each time you tap it, you rotate to the 

Chapter 2
68
next keyboard you requested earlier. The new language’s name appears 
briefly on the space bar to identify it.
Thanks to that ˚ button, you can freely mix languages and alphabets 
within the same document without having to duck back to some control 
panel to make the change. And thanks to the iPad’s virtual keyboard, the 
actual letters on the “keys” change in real time. (As an Apple PR rep puts 
it, “That’s really hard to do on a BlackBerry.”)
The ˚ button works in three ways:
• 	Tap it once to restore the most recent keyboard. Great if you’re fre-
quently flipping back and forth between two languages.
• 	Tap it rapidly to cycle among all the keyboards you’ve selected. (The 
name of the language appears briefly on the space bar to help you 
out.)
• 	If you, some United Nations translator, like to write in a lot of different 
languages, you don’t have to tap that ˚ key over and over again to 
cycle through the keyboard layouts. Instead, hold your finger down 
on the ˚ key. You get a convenient pop-up menu of the languages 
you’ve turned on, so you can jump directly to the one you want.

The Emoji Keyboard
Even if you speak only one language, don’t miss the emoji keyboard. It 
gives you a palette of smileys and fun symbols, also known as emoticons, 
to use in your correspondence.
Install it just as you would any other keyboard, as described above. Now, 
though, when you choose its name from the onscreen keyboard, you get 
hundreds upon hundreds of little graphic symbols, spread across five cat-
egories (plus a Recently Used category). Each category offers several 
pages full of symbols, represented by tiny dots above the keyboard.
Tip: To return to a category’s first page, you don’t have to swipe; just tap 
the category’s icon.
The bottom line is clear: Smileys are only the beginning. 
Note: These symbols show up fine on Apple machinery (phones, 
tablets, Macs) but generally don’t appear on other kinds of 
phones.
Connecting a Real Keyboard
This iPad feature barely merits an asterisk in Apple’s marketing materials. 
But if you’re any kind of wandering journalist, blogger, or writer, you might 
flip your lid over this: You can type on a real, full-sized, physical keyboard, 
and watch the text magically appear on your iPad’s screen—wirelessly.

Chapter 2
70
That’s because you can use a Bluetooth keyboard (the Apple Wireless 
Keyboard, for example) to type into your iPad. Dozens of iPad cases with 
built-in keyboards are also available; most also connect with Bluetooth.
To set this up, from the Home screen, tap SettingsÆBluetooth. Turn 
Bluetooth on, if it’s not already.
Now turn on the wireless keyboard. After a moment, its name shows up 
on the iPad screen in the Devices list; tap it. You’ll know the pairing was 
successful, because when you tap in a spot where the onscreen keyboard 
would usually appear, well, it doesn’t.
Typing is a lot easier and faster with a real keyboard. As a bonus, the 
Apple keyboard’s brightness, volume, and playback controls actually work 
to control the iPad’s brightness, volume, and playback. 
Tip: The Apple keyboard’s ´ key even works: It makes the iPad’s 
onscreen keyboard appear or disappear. Oh, and to switch 
languages, press c-space bar on the wireless keyboard. You’ll see 
the list of languages. Tap the space bar again to choose a different 
language.
When you’re finished using the keyboard, turn it off. The iPad goes back 
to normal.
Dictation
The iPad’s speech-recognition feature, sometimes called Siri (even though 
Siri is also the voice command feature), lets you enter text anywhere, into 
any program, just by speaking. Behind the scenes, it’s using the same 
Nuance recognition technology that powers the Dragon line of dictation 
programs.
It’s extremely fast and, in iOS 8, much more accurate (especially if you 
have an accent). Suddenly you don’t have to fuss with the tiny keyboard. 
The experience of “typing” is no longer claustrophobic. You can blather 
away into an email or draft a memo without ever looking at the screen.
Now, before you get all excited, here are the necessary footnotes:
• 	Voice typing works only when you have an Internet connection. If you 
don’t, the little ß button on the keyboard appears dimmed.
• 	Voice typing works best if there’s not a lot of background noise.

Typing, Editing & Searching
71
• 	Voice typing isn’t always practical, since everybody around you can 
hear what you’re saying. 
• 	Voice typing isn’t always accurate. Often, you’ll have to correct an 
error or two.
All right—expectations set? Then here’s how to type by speaking.
First, open up someplace where you can call up the keyboard: Messages, 
Notes, Mail, Safari, whatever. Tap, if necessary, so that the onscreen key-
board appears.
Tap the ß next to the space bar. When you hear the xylophone note, say 
what you have to say (below, top). 

Chapter 2
72
If there’s background noise, hold the tablet up to your head; if it’s relatively 
quiet, a couple of feet away is fine. You don’t have to speak slowly, loudly, 
or weirdly; speak normally. 
As you speak, the words fly onto the screen; that’s new in iOS 8. (In pre-
vious iOS versions, you’d have to wait until you stopped speaking to see 
any text appear. Sometimes, no text appeared at all, and you gnashed your 
teeth at all the time you’d just wasted.)
You have to speak your own punctuation, like this: “Dear Dad (colon): 
Please send money (dash)—as much as you can (comma), please (period).” 
The table at the end of this section describes all the different punctuation 
symbols you can dictate.
After you finish speaking, tap Done. Another xylophone note plays—
higher, this time—and you may see some of the words change right before 
your eyes, as though Siri is changing her mind. In fact, she is; she’s using 
the context of all the words you said to revise what she originally thought 
you said, as you said it. See?
Note: If no text appears at all, your Internet connection probably isn’t 
good enough. You can try again, or you can just sigh and resort 
to typing with your finger.
If the transcription contains errors, you can tap with your finger to edit 
them, exactly as you would fix an error in something you typed (previous 
page, bottom). (Make the effort; you’re simultaneously teaching your iPad 
to do better the next time.) Or, if the whole thing is a mess, you can shake 
your iPad, the universal gesture for Undo.
Note: Often, the iPad knows perfectly well when it might have gotten 
a word wrong—it draws a dashed underline beneath words or 
phrases it’s insecure about. You can tap one of those words or 
phrases to see the iPad’s alternative interpretation, which is often 
correct. 
Usually, you’ll find the accuracy pretty darned good, considering you didn’t 
have to train the software to recognize your voice. You’ll also find that the 
accuracy is better when you dictate complete sentences, and that long 
words fare better than short ones.

how to say it. 
NOTE: If you’ve ever used Dragon NaturallySpeaking (for Windows) or

You don’t always have to dictate these formatting commands, by the way. 
The iPad automatically inserts hyphens into phone numbers (you say, 
“2125561000,” and get “212-556-1000”); formats two-line street addresses 
without your having to say, “New line” before the city); handles prices 
automatically (“six dollars and thirty-two cents” becomes “$6.32”). 
It formats dates and Web addresses well, too; you can even use the nerdy 
shortcut “dub-dub-dub” when you want the “www” part of a Web address. 

Typing, Editing & Searching

The iPad recognizes email addresses, too, as long as you remember to say 
“at sign” at the right spot. You’d say, “harold (underscore) beanfield (at 
sign) gmail (dot) com” to get harold_beanfield@gmail.com. 
Tip: You can combine these formatting commands. Many iPad owners 
have wondered: “How do I voice-type the word “comma,” since 
saying, “comma” types out only the symbol?”
The solution: Say, “No space on, no caps on, C, O, M, M, A, no space 
off, no caps off.” That gives you the word “comma.”
Then again, it might just be easier to type that one out with your 
finger.
Cut, Copy, Paste
Copy and Paste do just what you’d expect. They let you grab some text 
off a Web page and paste it into an email message, copy directions from 
email into Notes, paste a phone number from your address book into a 
text message, and so on.
So how do you select text and trigger Cut, Copy, and Paste functions on 
a machine with no mouse and no menus? As on the Mac or PC, it takes 
three steps.
Step 1: Select the Text
Start by highlighting the text you want to cut or copy. 
• To select all. Suppose you intend to cut or copy everything in the text 
box or message. In that case, tap anywhere in the text to place the 
blinking insertion point. Then tap the insertion point itself to summon 
the selection buttons—one of which is Select All. 
• To select some. Double-tap the first word (or last word) that you 
want in the copied selection. That word is now highlighted, with blue 
dots at diagonal corners. Drag these handles to expand the selection 
to include all the text you want. The little magnifying loupe helps you 
release the dot at just the right spot.

Chapter 2
78
Tip: On a Web page, you can’t very well double-tap to select a word, 
because double-tapping means “zoom in.” Instead, hold your finger 
down on a word to produce the blue handles; the loupe magnifies 
the proceedings to help you. (If you highlight the wrong word, keep 
your finger down and slide to the correct one; the highlighting goes 
with you.)
However, if you’re zoomed out to see the whole page, holding down 
your finger highlights the entire block of text (a paragraph or even 
a whole article) instead of one word. Now you can expand the 
selection to include a photo, if you like; that way, you can copy and 
paste the whole enchilada into an outgoing email message.
Step 2: Cut or Copy
At this point, you’ve highlighted the material you want, and the Cut and 
Copy buttons are staring you in the face. Tap Cut (to remove the selected 
text) or Copy (to leave it but place a duplicate on your invisible Clipboard). 
Tip: And what if you want to get rid of the text without copying it to the 
Clipboard (because you want to preserve something you copied 
earlier, for example)? Easy: Just tap the d key!
Step 3: Paste
Finally, switch to a different spot in the text, even if it’s in a different win-
dow (for example, a new email message) or a different app (for example, 
Calendar or Notes). Tap in any spot where you’re allowed to type. Tap the 
Paste button to paste what you cut or copied. Ta-da!
...drag the handle.
Double-tap…

(Possible Step 4: Undo)
Everyone makes mistakes, right? Fortunately, there’s a secret Undo com-
mand, which can come in handy when you cut, copy, or paste something 
by mistake. 
The trick is to shake the iPad. The iPad then offers you an Undo button, 
which you can tap to confirm the backtracking. One finger touch instead 
of three. 
Tip: The shake-to-undo feature also works to undo dictating or typing—
not just cutting or pasting.
In fact, you can even undo the Undo. Just shake the tablet again; now the 
screen offers you a Redo button. Fun! (Except when you shake the tablet 
by accident and you get the Nothing to Undo message. But still.)
The Definitions Dictionary
On page 61, you can read about the spelling dictionary that’s built into 
the iOS—but that’s just a list of words. Your iPad also has a real dictionary, 
one that shows you definitions.

Chapter 2
80
You can look up any word that appears on the screen. Double-tap it to get 
the editing bar shown here at top; then tap Define. 
Tip: You can also double-tap the blinking insertion point that’s just 
before a word. On the editing bar, tap ’ to see the Define button.
(If you discover that there are “No definitions found,” tap Manage at the 
bottom of this screen for a list of dictionaries that you can download: 
English, French, Simplified Chinese, and so on. Tap U to download the 
ones you think you’ll use.)
Speak!
The iPad can read to you, too. Visit SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibilityÆ​
Speech and turn on Speak Selection. Choose a language (or accent), a 
voice, and a speaking rate. (The more realistic-sounding voices, like Alex 
and his brother Enhanced Quality, require you to download some audio 
files from Apple. Just tap the name to begin the download.)
From now on, among the other buttons that pop up whenever you select 
text, a handy Speak button appears. (You can see it in the illustration 
above.)

Typing, Editing & Searching
81
You can use the Speak button whenever you want to double-check the 
pronunciation of a word, whenever you want to have a Web article or 
email read to you aloud while you’re getting dressed for the day, or when-
ever you lose your voice and just want to communicate with the rest of 
the world.
Tip: Once you tap Speak, the button changes to say Pause. You’re in 
charge.
Spotlight: Global Search
The iPad’s global search feature is called Spotlight—and in iOS 8, it’s really 
global. Spotlight is no longer primarily for searching your tablet; it’s more 
like a typed version of Siri, in that it can call up information about movies, 
restaurants, news, and so on (details below).
How to Use Spotlight
The Spotlight screen is built into your Home screens. To see it, drag down-
ward within the screen. (If you drag down from the top by accident, you’ll 
open the Notification Center, which is a different story.)
In any case, the keyboard opens automatically (next page). Begin typ-
ing to identify what you want to find and open. For example, if you were 
trying to find a file called Pokémon Fantasy League, typing just pok or 
leag would probably suffice. (Spotlight doesn’t find text in the middles of 
words, though; it searches from the beginnings of words.) 
As you type, a results list appears below the search box, listing everything 
Spotlight can find containing what you’ve typed so far. 
They’re neatly grouped by category; the beginning of each category is 
marked with a heading like CONTACTS or MUSIC.
Tip: If you drag your finger to scroll the list, the keyboard helpfully 
vanishes so you can see more results.
Here’s what you might find in Spotlight’s list of results:
• Applications. For frequent downloaders, this may be the juiciest func-
tion: Spotlight searches the names of every app on your iPad. If you 
have dozens installed, this is a much more efficient way to find one 
than trying to page through all the Home screens, eyeballing the icons 
as you go. (The search results even identify which folder an app is in.)

Chapter 2
82
• Spotlight Suggestions. This is the big new feature in iOS 8— the busi-
ness about finding movies, music, apps, and other stuff from the Web.
The feature itself works beautifully. The hard part is teaching your-
self to use it—just remembering that it’s available. 
Spotlight now lists results from Wikipedia (when you search for, 
say, “rhubarb” or “Thomas Edison”); news (search for “SF Giants” 
or “Middle East negotiations”); restaurants, shops, and businesses 
(“Olive Garden” or “Apple Store”); the App Store (“Instagram” or 
“Angry Birds”); the iTunes Store (“Gravity” or “Beatles”); and the 
iBooks store (“Grisham” or “Little Women”).
The results list identifies which category each hit comes from. Tap-
ping a result does what you’d expect: for a Web article, opens the 
article; for a business, opens its Maps page so you can call it or get 
instant directions; for something from an Apple Store, opens the ap-
propriate store.

Typing, Editing & Searching
83
• Contacts. First names, last names, and company names.
• Music, Podcasts, Videos, Audiobooks. Song, performer, and album 
names, plus the names of podcasts, videos, and audiobooks. 
• Notes, Reminders, Voice Memos. The actual text of your notes and 
to-do items, and the names and descriptions of voice memos.
• Events. Calendar stuff: appointment names, meeting invitees, and 
locations (but not any notes attached to your appointments).
• Mail. The To, From, and Subject fields of all accounts. For certain 
accounts, you can even search inside the messages.
• Messages. Yep, you can search your text messages, too.
• Bing Web Results. You can tap Search Web at the bottom of the 
results list to hand off to Safari for a search. Handy to have it built 
right into Spotlight, really.
Tip: Many apps, like Contacts, Mail, Calendar, Music, and Notes, have 
their own search boxes (usually hidden until you scroll to the top of 
their lists). Those individual search functions are great when you’re 
already in the program where you want to search. The Spotlight 
difference is that it searches all these apps at once.
If you see the name and icon of whatever you were hoping to dig up, tap 
to open it. The corresponding app opens automatically.
How to Tweak Spotlight
You’ve just read about how Spotlight works fresh out of the box. But you 
can tailor its behavior to fit it to the kinds of things you look up most often. 
To open Spotlight’s settings, start on the Home screen. Tap SettingsÆ​
GeneralÆSpotlight Search.
You can tweak Spotlight in two ways here:
• Turn off categories. The checkmarks identify the kinds of things that 
Spotlight tracks. If you find that Spotlight uses up precious screen 
space listing categories you don’t use much, then tap to turn off their 
checkmarks. Now more of Spotlight’s space-constrained screen is 
allotted to icon types you do care about.
• 	 Prioritize the categories. This screen also lets you change the order 
of the category results; using the ˝ grip strip at the right side, you 
can drag an individual list item up or down. 

Chapter 2
84
For example, the factory setting is for Contacts to appear first in the 
menu. But Contacts has its own search box, so it might make more 
sense to put Events or Applications at the top of the list so that it’s 
quicker to do a schedule check or to fire up a certain app. You’ll 
have less scrolling to do once the results menu appears.

S
iri, the iPad’s famous voice-recognition technology, is actually 
two features, not one. First, there’s dictation, where the tablet 
types out everything you say. It’s faster than typing with the little 
onscreen keys, and it’s described in Chapter 2.
Second, there’s Siri the voice-controlled minion. You can say, “Wake me 
up at 7:45,” or “What’s Megan’s work number?” or “How do I get to the 
airport?” or “What’s the weather going to be like in San Francisco this 
weekend?”
You can say, “Make a note to rent Titanic this weekend.” Or “How many 
days until Valentine’s Day?” Or “Play some Electric Light Orchestra.” 
You can also ask questions about movies, sports, and restaurants. In 
each case, Siri thinks for a few seconds, displays a beautifully formatted 
response, and speaks in a calm voice.
In iOS 8, Siri gains two new magical powers. First, you can operate her 
hands-free, as long as your tablet is plugged into power. Instead of press-
ing the Home button to get her attention, you just say, “Hey, Siri.”
Second, you can now ask her, “What song is that?” or “Name that tune.” 
She’ll identify whatever song is playing in the background, just as the 
popular Shazam app does. It’s creepy/amazing.
Note: Siri requires an Internet connection. When your iPad isn’t in a 
WiFi hotspot (or when your cellular iPad doesn’t have service), 
you can’t use her.
Siri also requires an iPad that’s newer than the iPad 2.

Siri Voice Command
In 2010, Apple bought Siri, a company that made a voice-control app (no 
longer available) for the iPad. Apple cleaned it up, beefed it up, integrated 
it with iOS, and wound up with Siri, your virtual servant.
Note: Believe it or not, Siri is a spinoff from a Department of Defense 
research project called CALO (Cognitive Assistant that Learns 
and Organizes), which Wikipedia describes as “the largest 
artificial-intelligence project ever launched.” In a very real way, 
therefore, Siri represents your tax dollars at work.
The spinoff was run by the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), 
which should provide a hint as to the origin of Siri’s name.
Siri is a crisply accurate, astonishingly understanding, uncomplaining, 
voice-commanded servant. No voice training or special syntax is required. 
Most speech-recognition systems work only if you issue certain lim-
ited commands with predictable syntax, like, “Call 445-2340” or “Open 
Microsoft Word.” But Siri is different. She’s been programmed to respond 
to casual speech, normal speech. It doesn’t matter if you say, “What’s the 
weather going to be like in Tucson this weekend?” or “Give me the Tucson 
weather for this weekend” or “Will I need an umbrella in Tucson?” Siri 
understands almost any variation. 
And she understands regular, everyday speaking. You don’t have to sepa-
rate your words or talk weirdly; you just speak normally. 
It’s not Star Trek. You can’t ask Siri to clean your gutters or to teach you 
French. (Well, you can ask.)
But, as you’ll soon discover, the number of things Siri can do you for you 
is rather impressive. Furthermore, Apple continues adding to Siri’s intelli-
gence through software updates.
Note: Apple also keeps increasing the number of languages that Siri 
understands. Already, Siri understands English (American, British, 
Canadian, and Australian), German, French, Italian, Spanish, 
Japanese, Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean. You change 
the language by visiting SettingsÆGeneralÆSiri.

How to Use Siri
To get Siri’s attention, you have three choices:
• Hold down the Home button until you hear a double-beep. The iPad 
doesn’t have to be unlocked or awake, which is awesome. Just pick it 
up, and then hold down that Home button.
Tip: Some people press the Home button until the double-beep, then 
release the button and start talking. But you can also hold the Home 
button down the entire time you’re speaking. That way you know 
that Siri won’t attempt to execute your command before you’re 
finished saying it.
• Hold down the clicker on your earbuds cord, if you have one, or the 
Call button on your Bluetooth earpiece.
• Say, “Hey, Siri.” The double-beep plays. (You have to turn this fea-
ture on in advance. And it works only when the tablet is plugged into 
power, like a USB jack. Details in a moment.)
When that double-beep sounds, a visual “sound wave” responds to your 
voice, so you know Siri is listening. Ask your question or say your com-
mand. You don’t have to hold the iPad up to your mouth; Siri works per-
fectly well at arm’s length, on your desk in front of you, or on the car seat 
beside you.
Note: Apple insists that Siri is neither male nor female. In fact, if you ask 
Siri her gender, she’ll say something noncommittal, like, “Is this 
relevant?” But that’s just political correctness. Any baby-name 
Web site will tell you that Siri is a girl’s name. 
When you’re finished speaking, be quiet for a moment (or, if you’ve been 
pressing the Home button, release it). The iPad double-beeps again, at a 
higher pitch this time (meaning, “OK, I’ve got it”). About a second after 
you stop speaking, the ring around the microphone icon spins with ani-
mation—your sign that Siri is connecting with her master brain online and 
processing your request. After a moment, she presents (and speaks) an 
attractively formatted response.
Tip: You generally see only the most recent question and response on 
the Siri screen. But you can drag downward to see all the previous 
exchanges you’ve had with Siri during this session.

Chapter 3
88
To rephrase your question or cancel or start over, tap the screen to inter-
rupt Siri’s work. (You can also cancel by saying “Cancel” or just by pressing 
the Home button.) Tap the microphone icon to trigger your new attempt.
And when you’re completely finished talking to Siri, you can either press 
the Home button, hold down your earbuds clicker, or say something like 
“Goodbye,” “See you later,” or “Adios.” You’re taken back to whatever app 
you were using before.
How to Use “Hey, Siri”
Apple couldn’t very well let Android phones have all the fun with hands-
free voice commands. So in iOS 8 the iPad, too, can accept spoken com-
mands without your touching it. It’s an ideal feature for use in the car, when 
your hands and eyes should be focused on driving. (Of course, the safest 
arrangement is not to interact with your tablet at all when you’re driving.)
The iPad doesn’t respond to “Hey, Siri” unless you’ve met these two 
conditions:
• 	You’ve opened SettingsÆGeneralÆSiri and turned on Allow “Hey Siri.” 
(It comes turned off. Otherwise, a lot of people would be freaked out 
when they say things like “Jay’s weary” or “Space? Eerie!” and the tablet 
double-beeps in response.)
• 	The iPad is charging. Having to listen constantly for the “Hey, Siri” com-
mand is exhausting; it uses a lot of power. This requirement ensures that it 
won’t drain your battery.
At that point, you’re good to go. Anytime you want to ask Siri something, 
just say, “Hey, Siri”; at the sound of the double-beep, say your thing. 
Thanks to “Hey, Siri,” you now have a front-seat conversationalist, a little 
software friend who’s always happy to listen to what you have to say—and 
whose knowledge of the world, of news, of sports, and of history can help 
make those cross-country drives a little less dull.
What to Say to Siri
Siri comes with two different cheat sheets to help you learn her capabil-
ities. To produce either one, hold down the Home button to make Siri’s 
“What can I help you with?” screen appear. Then:
• Wait. After 5 seconds of silence, Siri begins displaying screen after 
screen of example commands, under the heading “Some things you 
can ask me.”

Siri & Speech
89
• Tap the tiny ? button to reveal the list of categories shown below.
TIP: Or just trigger Siri and then say, “What can I say?” or “What can you 
do?” or “Help me!” The same cheat sheet appears.
Here are the general categories of things you can say to Siri: 
• Opening apps. If you don’t learn to use Siri for anything else, for the 
love of Mike, learn this one. 
You can say, “Open Calendar” or “Play Angry Birds” or “Launch Calcu-
lator.” 
Result: The corresponding app opens instantly. It’s exactly the same 
as pressing the Home button, swiping across the screen until you find 
the app you’re looking for, and then tapping its icon—but without 
pressing the Home button, swiping across the screen until you find 
the app you’re looking for, and then tapping its icon. 
• Change your settings. You can make changes to certain basic set-
tings just by speaking your request. You can say, for example, “Turn 
on Bluetooth,” “Turn off WiFi,” “Turn on Do Not Disturb,” and “Turn on 
Airplane mode.” (You can’t turn off Airplane mode by voice, because 
Siri doesn’t work without an Internet connection.)
You can also make screen adjustments: “Make the screen brighter.” 
“Dim the screen.”

Chapter 3
90
Result: Siri makes the requested adjustment, tells you so, and displays 
the corresponding switch in case she misunderstood your intention.
NOTE: If you’ve protected your iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 with a 
fingerprint, you have to unlock it before you’re allowed to change 
any settings. Security and all that.
• Open Settings panels. When you need to make tweakier changes to 
Settings, you can open the most important panels by voice. “Open 
WiFi settings,” “Open Notification settings,” “Open wallpaper set-
tings,” and so on. 
You can open your apps’ settings this way, too: “Open Maps settings,” 
“Open Netflix settings,” “Open Delta settings,” and so on.
Siri’s smart enough not to open security-related settings this way; 
remember that you can use Siri even from the Lock screen. She’s pro-
tecting you from passing pranksters who might really mess up your 
tablet.
Result: Siri silently opens the corresponding page of Settings.
• Calling. Siri can place FaceTime calls for you. “FaceTime 
Harold.” “FaceTime Audio Nicole.” “Start a FaceTime call with Sheila 
Withins.” 
Result: Siri hands you off to the FaceTime app and places the call. At 
this point, it’s just as though you’d initiated the call yourself.
• Alarms. You can say, “Wake me up at 7:35,” “Change my 7:35 alarm to 
8:00,” “Wake me up in 6 hours,” “Cancel my 6 a.m. alarm,” (or “Delete 
my…” or “Turn off my…”). 
This is so much quicker than setting the iPad’s alarm the usual way.

Siri & Speech
91
Result: When you set or change an alarm, you get a sleek digital 
alarm clock, right there beneath Siri’s response. And Siri speaks to 
confirm what she understood.
• Timer. You can also control the Timer module of the tablet’s Clock 
app. It’s like a stopwatch in reverse, in that it counts down to zero—
handy when you’re baking something, limiting your kid’s video-game 
time, and so on. For example: “Set the timer for 20 minutes.” Or 
“Show the timer,” “Pause the timer,” “Resume,” “Reset the timer,” and 
“Stop it.” 
Result: A cool digital timer appears. A little stopwatch icon appears 
on the Lock screen to remind you that time is ticking down.
TIP: You can specify minutes and seconds: “Set the time for two 
minutes, thirty seconds,” for example.
• Clock. “What time is it?” “What time is it in San Francisco?” “What’s 
today’s date?” “What’s the date a week from Friday?” 
Result: When you ask about the time, you see the clock identifying 
the time in question. (For dates, Siri just talks to you and writes out 
the date.)
• Contacts. You can ask Siri to look up information in your address 
book (the Contacts app)—and not just addresses. For example, you 
can say, “What’s Gary’s work number?” “Give me Sheila Jenkins’s 
office tablet.” “Show Tia’s home email address.” “What’s my 
boss’s home address?” “When is my husband’s birthday?” “Show 
Larry Murgatroid.” “Find everybody named Smith.” “Who is P.J. 
Frankenberg?”
Result: A half “page” from your Contacts list. You can tap it to jump 
into that person’s full card in Contacts. (If Siri finds multiple listings for 
the person you named—“Bob,” for example—she lists all the matches 
and asks you to specify which one you meant.)

Chapter 3
92
Tip: In many of the examples on these pages, you’ll see that you can 
identify people by their relationship to you. You can say, “Show my 
mom’s work number,” for example, or “Give me directions to my 
boss’s house,” or “Call my girlfriend.” For details on teaching Siri 
about these relationships, see “Advanced Siri” on page 108.
• Text messages. “Send a text to Alex Rybeck.” “Send a message to 
Peter saying, ‘I no longer require your services.’ ” “Tell Cindy I’m run-
ning late.” “Send a message to Janet’s mobile asking her to pick me 
up at the train.” “Send a text message to 212-561-2282.” “Text Frank 
and Ralph: Did you pick up the pizza?” 
If this person has iMessage (an Apple gadget), the iPad sends an 
iMessage. If not, the “text” command works only if the iPad is set up 
to send texts through your iPhone (page 136).
Result: You see a miniature outgoing text message. Siri asks if you 
want to send it; say “Yes,” “Send,” or “Confirm” to proceed. 
Tip: If you’re using earbuds, headphones, or a Bluetooth speaker, Siri 
reads the message back to you before asking if you want to send it. 
(You can ask her to read it again by saying something like, “Review 
that,” “Read it again,” or “Read it back to me.” ) The idea, of course, 
is that if you’re wearing earbuds or using Bluetooth, you might be 
driving, so you should keep your eyes on the road.

Siri & Speech
93
If you need to edit the message before sending it, you have a couple 
of options. First, you can tap it; Siri hands you off to the Messages 
app for editing and sending.
Second, you can edit it by voice. You can say, “Change it to” to re-
dictate the message; “Add” to add more to the message; “No, send it 
to Frank” to change the recipient; “No” to leave the message on the 
screen without sending it; or “Cancel” to forget the whole thing.
You can also ask Siri to read incoming messages to you, which is 
great if you’re driving. For example, you can say, “Read my new mes-
sages,” and “Read that again.” 
Note: If you’ve opted to conceal the actual contents of incoming texts 
so that they don’t appear on your screen (page 15), then 
Siri can read you only the senders’ names or numbers—not the 
messages themselves.
You can even have her reply to messages she’s just read to you. “Re-
ply, ‘Congratulations (period). Can’t wait to see your trophy (exclama-
tion point)!’ ” “Tell him I have a flat tire and I’m going to be late.” 
• Email. Siri can read your email to you. For example, if you say, “Read 
my latest email” or “Read my new email,” Siri reads aloud your most 
recent email message. (Siri then offers you the chance to dictate a 
response.)
Or you can use the summary-listing commands. When you say, “Read 
my email,” Siri starts walking backward through your inbox, telling you 
the subject of each, plus who sent it and when. 

Chapter 3
94
After a few listings, Siri says: “Shall I read the rest?” That’s your oppor-
tunity to shut down what could be a very long recitation. If you say 
“Yes,” she goes on to read the entire list of subject lines, dates, and 
senders.
Tip: You can also use commands like, “Any new mail from Chris today?” 
“Show new mail about the world premiere.” “Show yesterday’s email 
from Jan.” All of those commands produce a list of the messages, 
but Siri doesn’t read them.
Result: Siri reads aloud.
You can also compose a new message by voice; anytime you use the 
phrase “about,” that becomes the subject line for your new message. 
“Email Mom about the reunion.” “Email my boyfriend about the dance 
on Friday.” “New email to Freddie Gershon.” “Mail Mom about Satur-
day’s flight.” “Email Frank and Cindy Vosshall and Peter Love about 
the picnic.” “Email my assistant and say, ‘Thanks for arranging the 
taxi!’ ” “Email Gertie and Eugene about their work on the surprise 
party, and say I really value your friendship.”
(If you’ve indicated only the subject and addressee, Siri prompts you 
for the body of the message.)
Tip: You can’t send mail to canned groups of people using Siri—at least 
not without MailShot, an iPad app that exists expressly for the 
purpose of letting you create email addressee groups.
You can reply to a message Siri has just described, too. “Reply, ‘Dear 
Robin (comma), I’m so sorry about your dog (period). I’ll be more 
careful next time (period).’ ” “Send him a message saying, ‘I got your 
note.’ ” 
Result: A miniature Mail message, showing you Siri’s handiwork be-
fore you send it.
• Calendar. Siri can make appointments for you. Considering how 
many tedious finger taps it usually takes to schedule an appointment 
in the Calendar app, this is an enormous improvement. “Make an 
appointment with Patrick for Thursday at 3 p.m.” “Set up a haircut 
at nine.” “Set up a meeting with Charlize this Friday at noon.” “Meet 
Danny Cooper at six.” “New appointment with Steve, next Sunday at 
seven.” “Schedule a conference call at 5:30 p.m. tonight in my office.” 
Result: A slice of that day’s calendar appears, filled in the way you 
requested.

Tip: Siri may also alert you to a conflict, something like this: “Note that 
you already have an all-day appointment about ‘Boston Trip’ for this 
Thursday. Shall I schedule this anyway?” Amazing.
You can also move previously scheduled meetings by voice. For 
example, “Move my 2:00 meeting to 2:30.” “Reschedule my meeting 
with Charlize to a week from Monday at noon.” “Add Frank to my 
meeting with Harry.” “Cancel the conference call on Sunday.”
You can even consult your calendar by voice. You can say, “What’s 
on my calendar today?” “What’s on my calendar for September 
23?” “When’s my next appointment?” “When is my meeting with 
Charlize?” “Where is my next meeting?” 
Result: Siri reads you your agenda and displays a tidy Day view of the 
specified date.
• Directions. By consulting the tablet’s GPS, Siri can set up the Maps 
app to answer requests like these: “How do I get to the airport?” 
“Show me 1500 Broadway, New York City.” “Directions to my assis-
tant’s house.” “Take me home.” “What’s my next turn?” “Are we there 
yet?” 
Tip: You can also say, “Stop navigation”—a great way to make Siri stop 
harassing you when you realize you know where you are.

Chapter 3
96
You can ask for directions to the home or work address of anyone in 
your Contacts list—provided that those addresses are in your Con-
tacts cards.
Result: Siri fires up the Maps app, with the start and end points of 
your driving directions already filled in. 
• Reminders. Siri is a natural match for the Reminders app. She can 
add items to that list at your spoken command. For example: “Remind 
me to file my IRS tax extension.” “Remind me to bring the science 
supplies to school.” “Remind me to take my antibiotic tomorrow at 
7 a.m.” 
The location-based reminders are especially amazing. They rely on 
GPS to know where you are. So you can say, “Remind me to visit the 
drugstore when I leave the office.” “Remind me to water the lawn 
when I get home.” “Remind me to check in with Nancy when I leave 
here.”
Tip: It’s pretty obvious how Siri knows to remind you when you leave 
“here,” because she knows where you are right now. But she also 
understands “home” and “office,” both yours and other people’s—if 
you’ve entered those addresses onto the corresponding people’s 
cards in Contacts.
Result: A miniature entry from the Reminders app, showing you that 
Siri has understood.

Siri & Speech
97
• Notes. You create a new note (in the Notes app) by saying things like, 
“Make a note that my shirt size is fifteen and a half” or “Note: Dad will 
not be coming to the reunion after all.” You can even name the note in 
your request: “Create a ‘Movies to Rent’ note.”
But you can also call up a certain note to the screen, like this: “Find 
my frequent-flyer note.” You can even summon a table-of-contents 
view of all your notes by saying, “Show all my notes.” 
Result: A miniature Notes page appears, showing your newly dictated 
text (or the existing note that you’ve requested).
Tip: You can keep dictating into the note you’ve just added. Say, “Add 
‘Return books to library’ ” (or just say, “Add,” and she’ll ask you what 
to add). She’ll keep adding to the same note until you say, “Note 
that…” or “Start a note” or “Take a note” to begin a fresh note page.
You can add text to an earlier Note: “Add Titanic II: The Voyage 
Home to my ‘Movies to Rent’ note.” (The first line of any note is also 
its title—in this case “Movies to Rent.”)
• Businesses. Siri is a walking (well, all right, non-walking) Yellow 
Pages. Go ahead, try it: “Find coffee near me.” “Where’s the closest 
Walmart?” “Find some pizza places in Cincinnati.” “Search for gas 
stations.” “French restaurants nearby.” “I’m in the mood for Chinese 
food.” “Find me a hospital.” “I want to buy a book.”

Chapter 3
98
Result: Siri displays a handsome list of businesses nearby that match 
your request.
Tip: She’s a sly dog, that Siri. She’ll help you out even if your requests 
are, ahem, somewhat off the straight and narrow. If you say, “I think 
I’m drunk,” she’ll list nearby cab companies. If you indicate that 
you’re craving relief from your drug addiction, she’ll provide you 
with a list of rehab centers. If you refer to certain biological urges, 
she’ll list escort services.
• Restaurants. Siri is also happy to serve as your personal concierge. 
Try “Good Italian restaurants around here,” “Find a good pizza joint in 
Cleveland,” or “Show me the reviews for Olive Garden in Youngstown.” 
Siri displays a list of matching restaurants (below, left), now with rat-
ings, reviews, hours, and so on.

Siri & Speech

But she’s ready to do more than just give you information. She can 
actually book your reservations, thanks to her integration with the 
OpenTable Web site. You can say, “Table for two in Belmont tonight,” 
or “Make a reservation at an inexpensive Mexican restaurant Saturday 
night at seven.”
Result: Siri complies by showing you the proposed reservation (facing 
page, right). Tap one of the offered alternative time slots, if you like, 
and then off you go. Everything else is tappable here, too—the ratings 
(tap to read customer reviews), phone number, Web address, map, 
and so on.
• Playing music. Instead of fumbling around in your Music app, save 
yourself steps and time by speaking the name of the album, song, or 
band: “Play some Beatles.” “Play ‘I’m a Barbie Girl.’ ” “Play some jazz.” 
“Play my jogging playlist.” “Play the party mix.” “Shuffle my ‘Dave’s 
Faves’ playlist.” “Play.” “Pause.” “Resume.” “Skip.” 
If you’ve set up any iTunes Radio stations (Chapter 7), you can call for 
them by name, too: “Play Dolly Parton Radio.” Or be more generic: 
Just say, “Play iTunes Radio” and be surprised. Or be more specific: 
Say, “Play some country music” (substitute your favorite genre).
Result: Siri plays (or skips, shuffles, or pauses) the music you asked 
for—without ever leaving whatever app you were using.
• Identifying music. In iOS 8, Siri can listen to the music playing in the 
room and try to identify it (song name, singer, album, and so on). 
Whenever there’s music playing, you can say things like, “What’s that 
song?” “What’s playing right now?” “What song is this?” or “Name 
that tune!”
Result: Siri listens to the music playing at your home/office/bar/
restaurant/picnic—and identifies the song by name and performer. 
There is also, needless to say, a Buy button.
• Weather. “What’s the weather going to be today?” “What’s the 
forecast for tomorrow?” “Show me the weather this week.” “Will it 
snow in Dallas this weekend?” “Check the forecast for Memphis on 
Friday.” “What’s the forecast for tonight?” “Can you give me the wind 
speed in Kansas City?” “Tell me the windchill in Chicago.” “What’s 
the humidity right now?” “Is it nighttime in Cairo?” “How’s the 
weather in Paris right now?” “What’s the high for Washington on 
Friday?” “When will Jupiter rise tomorrow?” “When’s the moonrise?” 
“How cold will it be in Houston tomorrow?” “What’s the tempera-
ture outside?” “Is it windy out there?” “When does the sun rise in 
London?” “When will the sun set today?” “Should I wear a jacket?” 

Chapter 3
100
Result: A convenient miniature Weather display for the date and 
place you specified.
• Stocks. “What’s Google’s stock price?” “What did Ford close at 
today?” “How’s the Dow doing?” “What’s Microsoft’s P/E ratio?” 
“What’s Amazon’s average volume?” “How are the markets doing?” 
Result: A tidy little stock graph, bearing a wealth of up-to-date statis-
tics.
• Find My Friends. You see this category only if you’ve installed Apple’s 
Find My Friends app. “Where’s Ferd?” “Is my dad home?” “Where are 
my friends?” “Who’s here?” “Who is nearby?” “Is my mom at work?”
Result: Siri shows you a beautiful little map with the requested per-
son’s location clearly indicated by a blue pushpin. (She does, that is, 
if you’ve set up Find My Friends, you’ve logged in, and your friends 
have made their locations available.)
• Search the Web. “Search the Web for a 2014 Ford Mustang.” 
“Search for healthy smoothie recipes.” “Search Wikipedia for the 
Thunderbirds.” “Search for news about the Netflix-Amazon merger.” 
Tip: Siri uses Microsoft’s Bing search service to perform its Web 
searches. If you prefer Google, just say so. Say, “Google Benjamin 
Franklin.” (For that matter, you can also ask Siri to “Yahoo” 
something—or example, “Yahoo low-cal dessert recipes.”)

Siri & Speech
101
Wikipedia is a search type all its own. “Search Wikipedia for Harold 
Edgerton.” “Look up Mariah Carey on Wikipedia.” Pictures get spe-
cial treatment, too: “I want to see pictures of cows.” You can also say, 
“Show me pictures of…” or “Find me…” or “Search for…” 
Result: Siri displays the results of your search right there on her own 
screen. Tap one of the results to open the corresponding Web page in 
Safari.
• Sports scores. At last you have a buddy who’s just as obsessed with 
sports trivia as you are. You can say things like, “How did the Indians 
do last night?” “What was the score of the last Yankees game?” 
“When’s the next Cowboys game?” “What baseball games are on 
today?”
You can also ask questions about individual players, like, “Who has the 
best batting average?” “Who has scored the most runs against the 
Red Sox?” “Who has scored the most goals in British soccer?” “Which 
quarterback had the most sacks last year?”
And, of course, team stats are fair game, like “Show me the roster for 
the Giants,” “Who is pitching for Tampa this season?” and “Is anyone 
on the Marlins injured right now?”
Result: Neat little box scores or factoids, complete with team logos.
• Movies. Siri is also the virtual equivalent of an insufferable film buff. 
She knows everything. “Who was the star of Groundhog Day?” “Who 
directed Chinatown?” “What is Waterworld rated?” “What movie won 
Best Picture in 1952?”

Chapter 3
102
It’s not just about old movies, either. Siri also knows everything about 
current showtimes in theaters. “What movies are opening this week?” 
“What’s playing at the Watton Cineplex?” “Give me the reviews for 
Titanic 2: The Return.” “What are today’s showtimes for Monsters 
University?”
Result: Tidy tables of movie theaters or movie showtimes. (Tap one 
for details.) Sometimes you get a movie poster filled with facts—and, 
of course, a link to rent or buy it on iTunes.
• Facts and figures. This is a huge category. It represents Siri’s partner-
ship with the Wolfram Alpha factual search engine (www.wolfram­
alpha.com). The possibilities here could fill an entire chapter—or an 
entire encyclopedia.
You can say things like, “How many days until Valentine’s Day?” 
“When was Abraham Lincoln born?” “How many teaspoons are in 
a gallon?” “What’s the exchange rate between dollars and euros?” 
“What’s the capital of Belgium?” “How many calories are in a Her-
shey bar?” “What’s a seventeen percent tip on sixty-two dollars 
for three people?” “What movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 
1985?” “When is the next solar eclipse?” “Show me the Big Dip-

per.” “What’s the tallest mountain in the world?” “What’s the price 
of gold right now?” “What’s the definition of ‘schadenfreude’?” “How 
much is twenty-three dollars in pesos?” “Generate a random num-
ber.” “Graph x equals 3y plus 12.” “What flights are overhead?”
Result: A specially formatted table, ripped right out of Wolfram Al-
pha’s knowledge base.
TIP: Siri can also harness the entire wisdom of Wikipedia. You can say, 
for example, “Search Wikipedia for Harold Edgerton,” or “Tell me 
about Abraham Lincoln,” or “Show me the Wikipedia page about 
Richard Branson.”
• Post to Twitter or Facebook. iOS is a red-blooded, full-blown Twitter 
companion. So you can say things like, “Tweet, ‘I just saw a three-
headed dog catch a Frisbee in midair. Unreal.’ ” “Tweet with my loca-
tion, ‘My car just broke down somewhere in Detroit. Help?’ ” 
Facebook is fair game, too. You can say, “Post to Facebook, ‘The guy 
next to me kept his cellphone on for the whole plane ride,’ ” or “Write 
on my wall, ‘I can’t believe I ate the whole thing.’ ” 
Result: Siri offers you a sheet (miniature dialog box) where you can 
approve the transcription and then, if it all looks good, send it off to 
your Twitter or Facebook feed.
TIP: If someone’s Twitter address is recorded in Contacts, you can say, 
“Tweet Casey Robin: Loved your last tweet!” Siri sends a tweet to 
that person (@CaseyRobin253 Loved your last tweet!). Anyone who 
follows both of you will see that tweet. (Alas, Siri cannot send direct 
messages—private person-to-person tweets.)

Chapter 3
104
• Search Twitter. If you say something like, “What are people saying?” 
or “What’s going on?” or “What’s happening on Twitter?” you see a 
list of tweets on the current trending topics on Twitter. (Tap a tweet in 
the list to open it into a new window that contains more information 
and a View in Twitter button.)
Or ask, “What are people saying about the Chicago Bears?” to read 
tweets on that subject. Or, “What does Ashton Kutcher say?” to 
see his most recent tweets. (You can substitute the names of other 
people or companies on Twitter.) Or “Search Twitter for the hash-
tag ‘FirstWorldProblems.’ ” (A hashtag is a searchable phrase like 
#toofunny or #iPadAir, that makes finding tweets on Twitter easier.)
Result: Siri displays 10 tweets that match your query. 
You may never find the end of the things Siri understands, or the ways that 
she can help you. If her repertoire seems intimidating at first, start simple—
use her to open apps, dial by voice, send text messages, and set alarms. 
You can build up your bag of tricks as your confidence builds.
Note: Remember that you can use Siri without even unlocking your 
tablet—and without any security, like your passcode. Among 
certain juvenile circles, therefore, Siri is the source of some juicy 
pranks. Someone who finds your tablet on a table could change 
your calendar, send texts or emails, or even change what Siri calls 
you (“Call me, ‘You idiot’ ”), without needing the iPad password!
The solution is simple. In SettingsÆPasscode (or Touch ID & 
Passcode), scroll way down; under “Allow access when locked,” 
you can turn off Siri. Of course, you’ve now lost the convenience 
of using Siri when the tablet is locked. But at least you’ve 
prevented having your own tablet call you an idiot.

Siri & Speech
105
When Things Go Wrong
If Siri mis-recognizes your instructions, you’ll know it, because you can see 
her interpretation of what you said (as shown on the facing page). And, 
as indicated by the little hint tap to edit, you can tap Siri’s interpretation 
to open up an editing screen so that you can make corrections by typing. 
TIP: You can also correct a misheard command just by speaking the 
correct version, like this: “I meant Chicago.” Siri gets what you mean.
If Siri recognizes what you said but it isn’t within her world of comprehen-
sion, she offers you a Search the web button as a last resort.
Siri’s Personality
Siri’s understanding of casual spoken commands is so impressive that you 
might sometimes think she’s almost human. And that, of course, is exactly 
what Apple wants you to think.
You can say all kinds of off-kilter things to Siri. Whoever programmed her 
had a deliciously sassy sense of humor. 
For example, if you ask her, “What is the meaning of life?” she responds 
with one of nine different answers. She might say, “I can’t answer that now, 
but give me some time to write a very long play in which nothing hap-
pens.” Or “Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book 
every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live in peace and har-
mony with people of all creeds and nations.” Or: “All evidence to date sug-
gests it’s chocolate.”
Siri is full of such comebacks, and there are whole Web sites dedicated 
to her snark. Here are a few examples. (The list here won’t ruin the fun, 
because Siri actually has several different comebacks to most of these 
questions.) 
You: “Who’s your daddy?” Siri: “You are. Can we get back to work now?”
You: “Open the pod bay doors, Hal.” Siri: “I’m sorry, I’m afraid I can’t do 
that.” (Then: “Are you happy now?”)
You: “Knock knock.” Siri: “Knock knock. Who’s there? Joshua. Joshua who? 
Joshua, I don’t do knock-knock jokes.”
You: “What are you wearing?” Siri: “You have the wrong personal assistant, 
David.”
You: “Who’s the boss?” (Siri presents the vital statistics of Bruce 
Springsteen.)

Chapter 3
106
You: “Beam me up, Siri!” Siri: “Please remove your belt, shoes, and jacket, 
and empty your pockets.” 
You: “Show me the money.” Siri: “I’ve found 23 ATMs that are fairly close 
to you…”
You, in the evening: “Good morning, Siri.” Siri: “Good morning? It’s 9:24 
p.m.!”
You: “How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could 
chuck wood?” Siri: “42 cords of wood, to be exact. Everyone knows that.” 
You: “Guess what.” Siri: “You won the lottery?”
You: “Talk dirty to me.” Siri: “Humus. Compost. Pumice. Silt. Gravel.”
You: “Why did the chicken cross the road?” Siri: “I am not perspicacious 
about the peregrinations of poultry.”
You: “Do you have a religion?” Siri: “My policy is the separation of spirit and 
silicon.”
You: “Klaatu barada nikto.” Siri: “OK, I’ll pass the message on to Gort.” (You 
kind of have to know The Day the Earth Stood Still to get it.) 
Here are a few other things to say to Siri when you get bored:
Tip: You may notice that Siri addresses you by name in her typed 
answers, but she doesn’t always speak it when she reads those 
answers out loud. 
Ordinarily, she calls you whatever you’re called in Contacts. But 
you can make her call you whatever you like. Say, “Call me Master” 
or “Call me Frank” or “Call me Ishmael.” If you confirm when she 
asks, then from now on that’s what Siri will call you in her typed 
responses.
I love you, Siri.
Will you marry me? 
You’re so sexy.
When is your birthday?
What’s the best tablet?
Can you sing?
Why are we here?
You’re cute.
You make me so mad!
What do you want?
Tell me a joke.
Tell me a story.
Sing for me.
I’m cold.
Do you love me?
Why are we here?
I need a bathroom.
What are you doing?

Advanced Siri
With a little setup, you can extend Siri’s powers in some intriguing ways.
Teach Siri about Your Relationships
When you say, “Text my mom” or “Call my fiancée” or “Remind me to 
replace the lightbulbs when I get to my son’s house,” how does Siri know 
whom you’re talking about? Sure, Siri is powerful artificial intelligence, but 
she’s not actually magic.
Turns out you teach her by referring to somebody in your Contacts list. 
Say to her something like, “My assistant is Jan Carpenter” or “Tad Cooper 
is my boyfriend.” When Siri asks for confirmation, say “Yes” or tap Confirm. 
Or wait for Siri to ask you herself. If you say, “Email my dad,” Siri asks, “Who 
is your dad?” Just say his name; Siri remembers that relationship from now 
on. (The available relationships are mother, father, brother, sister, child, son, 
daughter, spouse, wife, husband, boss, partner, manager, assistant, girl-
friend, boyfriend, and friend.) 
Behind the scenes, Siri lists these relationships on your card in Contacts.
Now that you know that, you can figure out how to edit or delete these 
relationships. Which is handy—not all relationships, as we know, last forever. 
Fix Siri’s Name Comprehension
Siri easily understands common names—but if someone in your family, 
work, or social circle has an unusual name, you may quickly become frus-
trated. After all, you can’t text, call, email, or get directions to someone’s 
house unless Siri understands the person’s name when you say it.
One workaround is to use a relationship, as described earlier. That way, you 
can say, “Call my brother” instead of “Call Ilyich” (or whatever his offbeat 
name is).
Another is to use Siri’s pronunciation-learning feature. It kicks in in several 
different situations:
• When you’re texting. If Siri offers the wrong person’s name when you 
try to text someone by voice, say, “Someone else.” After you’ve sent 
the message, Siri apologetically says, “By the way, sorry I didn’t recog-
nize that name. Can you teach me how to say it?”

Siri & Speech
109
• After Siri botches a pronunciation. Tell her, “That’s not how to pro-
nounce his name.”
• Whenever it occurs to you. You can start the process by saying, 
“Learn to pronounce Reagann Tsuki’s name” or “Learn to pronounce 
my mom’s name.”
• In Contacts. Open somebody’s “card” in Contacts; start Siri and say, 
“Learn to pronounce her name.”
In each case, with tremendous courtesy, Siri walks you through the pro-
cess of teaching her the correct pronunciation. She offers you three 2 but-
tons; each triggers a different pronunciation. Tap Select next to the correct 
one (or tap Tell Siri again if none of the three is correct).
By the end of the process, Siri knows two things: how to speak that per-
son’s name aloud, and how to recognize that name when you say it aloud.
Siri Settings
In SettingsÆGeneralÆSiri, you can fiddle with several Siri settings:
• On/Off. If you turn Siri off, you can no longer command your iPad 
using the Siri commands described in this chapter. Nor can you dic-
tate to type; the ß button disappears from the onscreen keyboard.
Note: And why would anyone willingly turn off Siri? One reason: Using 
Siri involves transmitting a lot of data to Apple, which gives some 
people the privacy willies. Apple’s computers collect everything 
you say to Siri, the names of your songs and playlists, your 
personal information in Contacts, plus all the other names in 
your Contacts (so that Siri can recognize them when you refer to 
them).
• Allow “Hey, Siri.” Siri’s new ability to wake up when spoken to is a 
blessing when your hands have better things to do. But if you find her 
perking up to take requests when you didn’t say “Hey, Siri”—if she’s 
misinterpreting everyday spoken expressions as attempts to wake 
her—you can turn her listening off here.
• Language. What language and accent do you have? The options 
here include 19 languages, accents, and dialects. For example, Siri 
can speak English in four accents—American, British, Canadian, 
and Australian. Even if you’re American, it’s fun to give Siri a cute 
Australian accent.

Chapter 3
110
• Voice Gender. That’s right, kids: Siri can have either a man’s voice or a 
woman’s voice.
• Voice Feedback. Siri generally replies to your queries with both text 
and a synthesized voice. Here, by choosing Handsfree Only, you can 
tell Siri not to bother speaking when you’re looking at the screen and 
can read the responses for yourself. In other words, you’re telling her 
to speak only if you can’t see the screen because you’re on speaker-
phone, using a headset, listening through your car’s Bluetooth system, 
and so on. 
• My Info. Siri needs to know which card in Contacts contains your 
information and lists your relationships. That’s how she’s able to 
respond to queries like “Call my mom,” “Give me directions to my 
brother’s office,” “Remind me to shower when I get home,” and so on. 
Use this setting to show Siri which card is yours.

Calling & FaceTime

T
he iPad, of course, is not a phone. Most people assume, there-
fore, that you can’t send and receive regular text messages on 
it—and that you can’t make voice calls on it, holding the thing up 
to your head to carry on a conversation. That’s because even the cellular-
equipped model doesn’t connect to the cellular voice network; only the 
cellular data network, for using Internet features.
And yet it’s not quite as poor a communications device as you might 
think. No, you can’t make traditional cellular voice calls with the iPad 
alone, but you can make FaceTime audio calls (to other people who have 
Apple gadgets). You can’t send regular text messages, but you can send 
iMessages (again, to other Apple devices). 
But if you also own an iPhone, then you can make regular tablet calls and 
send regular texts from the iPad. The phone in your pocket acts as a glo-
rified relay station. 
This chapter covers all these tricks.
FaceTime Audio Calls
FaceTime is Apple’s proprietary wireless calling software. It lets you place 
free audio and video calls from your iPad to any other Apple gadget: 
phone, tablet, iPod Touch, or Mac. Some people consider it Apple’s ver-
sion of Skype; others consider it a godsend for communicating with peo-
ple in other cities or countries for free. In any case, it’s pretty simple and 
pretty great.
These calls don’t eat into your cell minutes and aren’t transmitted over 
your cell carrier’s voice network; these are Internet calls. 
When you’re in a WiFi hotspot, they’re completely free. When you’re not, 
your carrier’s data network carries your voice (if you have the cellular 
iPad). Sold yet?

FaceTime

Chapter 4

All right: Here’s how to make free Internet voice and video calls.
The Setup
Before you begin, open SettingsÆFaceTime, make sure FaceTime is turned 
on, and sign in with your Apple ID.
Note, furthermore, that—in case you missed it—you can place FaceTime 
calls only to other iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, and Macs. Your call recipi-
ents must also have FaceTime turned on, and must also have signed in 
with their Apple IDs.
You have to know their phone number (if it’s an iPhone) or their Apple ID–
registered email address (if it’s an iPad, iPod Touch, Mac, or iPhone). You 
can use either (phone or email) to place a FaceTime call. Weird but true.
Placing a Call
There are starting points for placing a FaceTime call all over iOS 8. For 
example:
• From Siri. The quickest way to start a FaceTime call may be simply to 
say, “FaceTime audio call Mom,” “FaceTime audio call Chris Taylor,” or 
whatever. The iPad refers to your Contacts app for the right connec-
tion info.
• From the FaceTime app. Open the FaceTime app. It presents a list 
of your recent FaceTime calls. Tap a name to place a new call to that 
person, or tap * to view a history of your calls with that person (and 
buttons for placing new ones).
Or, to find your callee from your own Contacts list, tap the n button. 
Find a name, tap it, and then tap Ï to place the call. 
If your future conversation partner isn’t in Contacts yet, then tap 
where it says Enter name, email, or number, and do just that. 
• From Contacts. In the Contacts app, if you tap a person’s name, you’ll 
find C buttons that place FaceTime audio calls.
• From Messages. If you’re chatting away with somebody by text and 
you realize that typing is no longer appropriate for the conversation, 
tap Details at the top of the screen. Tap C.
For the call to go through, both devices must be online, either in a WiFi 
hotspot or, for devices so equipped, in a cellular coverage area.

Answering a Call
When someone calls your iPad, you’ll know it, you hear a ring and see the 
caller’s name and photo fill that giant screen. (Smell, feel, and taste will 
have to wait until iOS 9.)
Note: For details on choosing a ringtone, see page 479.
How you answer depends on what’s happening at the time:
• If you’re using the iPad, tap the green Accept button. Tap the red 
hangup button when you’ve both said enough.
• If the iPad is asleep or locked, the screen lights up and says slide to 
answer. If you slide your finger as indicated by the arrow, you simulta-
neously unlock the tablet and answer the call.
• If you’re wearing earbuds, the music fades out and then pauses; you 
hear the ring both through the tablet’s speaker and through your ear-
buds. Answer by squeezing the clicker on the earbud cord or by using 
either of the methods described above.
When the call is over, you can click again to hang up—or just wait 
until the other guy hangs up. Either way, the music fades in again and 
resumes from the spot where you were so rudely interrupted.

Online and on the Tablet, Together
Don’t forget that the iPad is a multitasking master. Once you’re on a 
FaceTime call, you can dive into any other program—to check your calen-
dar, for example—without interrupting the call.
You can even use the tablet’s Internet functions (Web, email, apps, and so 
on) without interrupting your call.
Silencing the Ring
Sometimes you need a moment before you can answer the call; maybe 
you need to exit a meeting or put in the earbuds, for example. In that case, 
you can stop the ringing by pressing one of the physical buttons on the 
edges (the Sleep/Wake button or either volume key). The caller still hears 
the tablet ringing, and you can still answer, but at least the sound won’t be 
annoying those around you.
If nobody answers, the call eventually gives up, and a “missed call” note 
appears on the callee’s screen. There’s no such thing as FaceTime voicemail.
Not Answering Calls
There are all kinds of reasons why you might not want to accept an incom-
ing call. Maybe you’re in a meeting. Maybe you’re driving. Maybe you can 
see that the call is coming from someone you really don’t want to deal 
with right now.
Fortunately, you’ve chosen the right tablet. You have all kinds of juicy ways 
to slam the door in somebody’s face.
If you wait long enough (about 20 rings), the incoming ringing will just 
give up.
Whenever your tablet rings, though, the screen bears a small white Message 
button (shown here at right). If you tap it, you get a choice of three canned 
text messages. Tapping one immediately ends the call and sends the cor-

Calling & FaceTime
115
responding message to the Apple gadget that’s calling you. If you’re driv-
ing or in a meeting, this feature is a lot more polite and responsive than just 
ignoring the poor slob.
Tip: You can’t edit these three canned messages on the iPad, even 
though you can on the iPhone.
The fourth button, Custom, lets you type or dictate a new message on the 
spot. (“I’m in a meeting and, frankly, your call isn’t worth getting fired for” 
comes to mind.)
Remind Me
Tapping the Remind Me button—another way to decline an incoming call— 
offers you one time-based option, In 1 Hour (which sets up a reminder to 
return the call an hour from now), and three location-based options (fac-
ing page, left): When I leave, When I get home, and When I get to work. 
(The home and work options appear only if the iPad knows your home 
and work addresses—because you’ve entered them in your own card in 
Contacts.)
These options use the tablet’s GPS circuitry to detect when you’ve left 
your current inconvenient-to-take-the-call location, whether it’s a job 
interview, a first date, or an outhouse. 
Leave a Message
OK, let’s say you’re the one placing the call. And the dude at the other end 
doesn’t pick up—or hits Decline because he really doesn’t want to talk to 
you right now.
You have three options on your iPad’s screen: Cancel, Call Back (that is, try 
again right now), or Leave a Message. That last option doesn’t really leave 
a message in the voicemail sense; instead, it opens the Messages app, so 
you can type or dictate a text message for the person you were trying to 
reach.
Fun with FaceTime Audio Calls
The iPad makes it pitifully easy to perform stunts like turning on the 
speaker­phone, putting someone on hold, taking a second call, and so on. 
Here are the options you get when you’re on a call (previous picture, bot-
tom middle).

Chapter 4
116
Mute
Tap this button to mute your own microphone, so the other guy can’t 
hear you. (You can still hear him, though.) Now you have a chance to yell 
upstairs, to clear the phlegm from your throat, or to do anything else you’d 
rather the other party not hear. Tap again to unmute.
Keypad
This button is dimmed on FaceTime calls. It’s available only when you’re 
making actual phone calls through your iPhone, as described on page 
122.
Speaker
Tap this button to turn on the iPad’s built-in speakerphone—a great hands-
free option when you’re caught without your earbuds or Bluetooth head-
set. (In fact, the speakerphone doesn’t work if the earbuds are plugged in 
or if a Bluetooth headset is connected.)
When you tap the button, it turns white to indicate that the speaker is acti-
vated. Now you can put the iPad down on a table or a counter and have 
a conversation with both hands free. Tap speaker again to channel the 
sound back into the built-in earpiece.
Add Call
Suppose you’re on a call. Here are some of the tricks you can do:
• Make an outgoing call. Tap add call. The iPad puts the first person on 
hold—neither of you can hear the other—and opens your Contacts list. 
You can now make a second call just the way you made the first. The 
top of the screen makes clear that the first person is still on hold as 
you talk to the second.
• Receive an incoming call. What happens when a second FaceTime 
call comes in while you’re already on a call? You can tap End & Accept 
(answer the incoming call, hang up on the first), Decline (reject the 
incoming call), or Hold & Accept (take the incoming call, put the first 
one on hold).
When you’re on two FaceTime calls at once, the top of the screen identi-
fies both other parties. Two new buttons appear, too:
• Swap lets you flip between the two calls. At the top of the screen, you 
see the names of your callers. One says hold (the one who’s on hold, 
of course) and the other bears a time counter, which lets you know 
whom you’re actually speaking to. 

Calling & FaceTime
117
Think how many TV and movie comedies have relied on the old 
“Whoops, I hit the wrong button and now I’m bad-mouthing some-
body directly instead of behind his back!” gag. That can’t happen on 
the iPad. 
You can swap calls by tapping swap or by tapping the hold person’s 
name or number.
• Merge Calls is dimmed on FaceTime calls. It, too, is useful only when 
you’re placing actual phone calls through an iPhone (page 122).
Hold
What’s that? You don’t see any button called Hold? Yet it’s there. Hold 
down the mute button for a couple of seconds. Now the button changes 
to say hold; neither you nor the other guy can hear anything. Tap again to 
resume the conversation.
e
As you could probably guess, this button ends the call. (If someone was on 
hold, you now drop back to that call.)
FaceTime Video Calls
Your iPad, as you’re probably aware, has two cameras—one on the back 
and one on the front. And that can mean only one thing: Video calling has 
arrived. 
These are good video calls, with no sign-up or setup, with a single tap. 
The picture and audio are generally rock solid, with very little delay, and 

Chapter 4
118
it works the first time and every time. Now Grandma can see the baby, or 
you can help someone shop from afar, or you can supervise brain surgery 
from thousands of miles away (some medical training is recommended).
You can enjoy these Jetsons fantasies when calling between iPhones, 
iPads, iPod Touches, and Macs. They work over WiFi or cellular (if you 
have a cellular iPad). You just have to know the other person’s phone num-
ber or email address—and that person has to have a free Apple or iCloud 
account.
Being able to make video calls like a regular phone call is a huge conve-
nience. Never again will you return home from the store and get scolded 
for buying the wrong size, style, or color. 
In any case, FaceTime couldn’t be easier to fire up—in all the usual ways:
• From Siri. “FaceTime Mom,” “FaceTime Chris Taylor.”
• When you’re already on a FaceTime audio call with someone. This 
is a good technique when you want to ask first if the other guy wants 
to do video, or when you’ve been chatting and suddenly there’s some 
reason to do video. In any case, there’s nothing to it: Just tap the 
FaceTime icon that’s right on the screen. (With one tap, your buddy 
can either accept—and hang up the audio call in the process—or, if he 
just got out of the shower, decline.)

Calling & FaceTime
119
• From the FaceTime app. Tap Video at the top left of the screen, and 
then tap a name in the Recent Call list. Or tap the n button to find a 
name in Contacts. Or tap where it says Enter name, email, or number, 
and do so. 
• From Contacts. In the Contacts app, tap Ï next to a person’s name.
• From Messages. If you’re chatting away with somebody by text and 
you realize that typing is no longer appropriate for the conversation, 
then tap Details at the top of the screen. Tap Ï.
At this point, the other guy receives an audio and video message inviting 
him to a chat. If he taps Accept, then you’re on. You’re on each other’s 
screens, seeing and hearing each other in real time. (You appear on 
your own screen, too, in a little inset window. It’s spinach-in-your-teeth 
protection.)
Once the chat has begun, here’s some of the fun you can have:
• Rotate the screen. FaceTime works in either portrait (upright) or 
landscape (widescreen) view; just turn your tablet 90 degrees. Of 
course, if your calling partner doesn’t also turn her gadget, she’ll see 
your picture all squished and tiny, with big black areas filling the rest 
of the screen. 
Tip: The m (Lock Rotation) button described on page 38 works in 
FaceTime, too. That is, you can stop the picture from rotating when 
you turn the tablet—as long as you’re happy with full-time upright 
(portrait) orientation.
• Snap a commemorative photo. You can immortalize a chat by using 
the screenshot keystroke (Sleep + Home). You wind up with a still 
photo of your videochat in progress, safely nestled in the Camera Roll 
of your Photos app.
• Mute the audio. Tap Â to silence the audio that you’re sending. Great 
when you need to yell at the kids.
• Mute the video. When you leave the FaceTime app for any reason 
(press the Home button and then open a different program, if you 
like), the other guy’s screen goes black. He can’t see what you’re 
doing when you leave the FaceTime screen. He can still hear you, 
though.
This feature was designed to let you check your calendar, look some-
thing up on the Web, or whatever, while you’re still chatting. But it’s 
also a great trick when you need to adjust your clothing, pick at your 

Chapter 4
120
teeth, or otherwise shield your activity from the person on the other 
end.
In the meantime, the call is, technically, still in progress—and a green 
banner at the top of the Home screen reminds you of that. Tap there, 
on the green bar, to return to the video call.
• Show what’s in front of you. Sometimes, you’ll want to show your 
friend what you’re looking at. That is, you’ll want to turn on the cam-
era on the back of the iPad, the one pointing away from you, to show 
off the baby, the artwork, or the broken engine part.
That’s easy enough; just tap z on your screen. The iPad switches 
from the front camera to the back camera. Now you and your callee 
can both see what you’re seeing. 
Tap z again to return to the front camera.
When you and your buddy have had quite enough, tap End to terminate 
the call. (Although it’s easy to jump from phone call to videochat, there’s 
no way to go the other direction.)
And marvel that you were alive to see the day.

Calling & FaceTime
121
Do Not Disturb
When you turn on Do Not Disturb, the iPad is quiet, dark, and still. It doesn’t 
ring, chirp, light up, or display messages. A p icon appears on the status 
bar to remind you why it seems to be so uncharacteristically depressed.
Yes, Airplane mode does the same thing, but there’s a big difference: In Do 
Not Disturb mode, the tablet is still online. FaceTime calls, texts, emails, 
and other communications continue to chug happily away; they just don’t 
draw attention to themselves.
Do Not Disturb is what you want when you’re in bed each night. You don’t 
really want to be bothered with chirps for Facebook status updates and 
Twitter posts, but it’s fine for the tablet to collect them for the morning.
Bedtime is why Do Not Disturb comes with two fantastic additional set-
tings: one that turns it on and off automatically on a schedule, so that the 
tablet goes dark each night at the same time you do, and another that lets 
you designate important people whose calls and texts are allowed to get 
through. You know—for emergencies.
Turning on Do Not Disturb
To turn on Do Not Disturb manually, you have three options:
• 	Tell Siri, “Turn on Do Not Disturb.”
• 	Swipe upward to open the Control Center, and tap the p icon so that 
it turns white.
• 	Open Settings, tap Do Not Disturb, and tap Manual. 
To set it up on a schedule, visit SettingsÆDo Not Disturb. Turn on 
Scheduled, and then tap the From/To block to specify starting and ending 
hours. (There’s no separate setting for weekends; Do Not Disturb will turn 
on and off for the same hours every day of the week.)
Allowing Special Callers Through
What if your child, your boss, or your elderly parent needs you urgently in 
the middle of the night? Turning the tablet off completely, or putting it into 
Airplane mode, would leave you unreachable in an emergency.
That’s why Apple built in the Allow Calls From option. When you open 
SettingsÆDo Not Disturb and then tap Allow Calls From, you’re offered 
options like Everyone (all FaceTime calls and texts come through) and No 
One (the tablet is still online, but totally silent). 

Chapter 4
122
You can also create an arbitrary group of people—just your mom and sister, 
just your boss and nephew, whatever. You have to create these address-
book groups on your computer (or using an app like Groups by Qbix). 
Once you’ve done that, their names appear on the Allow Calls From screen 
under Groups. You can designate any one of them as the lucky exception 
to Do Not Disturb.
One More Safety Measure
The Do Not Disturb settings screen also offers something called Repeated 
Calls. If you turn this on, then if anybody tries to FaceTime call you more 
than once within 3 minutes, he’ll ring through.
The idea here is that nobody would call you multiple times unless she 
needed to reach you urgently. You certainly wouldn’t want Do Not Disturb 
to block somebody who’s trying to tell you that there’s been an accident, 
that you’ve overslept, or that you’ve just won the lottery.
Locked vs. Unlocked
The final option on the settings screen is the Silence option. If you choose 
Always, then Do Not Disturb works exactly as described above.
But if you choose Only while iPad is locked, then the tablet does ring 
when you’re using it. Because, obviously, if the tablet is awake, then so 
are you. It’s a great way to ensure that you don’t miss important FaceTime 
calls if you happened to have awakened early today and started working.
Tip: In iOS 8, Apple added FaceTime Call Waiting. If you’re on a 
FaceTime audio or video call, and someone else FaceTime calls you, 
your tablet rings—and you can either tap Decline or End & Accept. 
(Group FaceTiming will have to wait for iOS 9.)
Making Actual Phone Calls
You can now make and take actual cellular phone calls on your iPad—if 
you also have an iPhone. The iPhone, sitting anywhere nearby, can be the 
cellular module for your tablet—even if that iPhone is asleep and locked.

Calling & FaceTime
123
When a call comes in to your iPhone’s number, your iPad rings, and the 
screen lights up to show who it is or what the number is:
You can tap to answer it (or decline it); your iPad’s microphone and speaker 
become your speakerphone. 
You can also place a call the same way: Just click any phone number you 
find on the iPad: in Contacts, in Safari, in an email message, and so on. 
To make this work, the iPhone and the iPad must be on the same WiFi net-
work. They both have to be signed into the same iCloud account. And you 
have to open the FaceTime settings on each device and make sure they’re 
both set to use the same iCloud account. 
After that—it just works. You have exactly the same “Not now” buttons 
described on page 115 (Remind Me and Leave a Message). Even call 
waiting works—if a second call comes in, your iPad notifies you and offers 
you the chance to put the first one on hold.
Crazy.
Tip: If you own a bunch of Apple machines, it might drive you crazy that 
they all now ring at once when a call comes in. Fortunately, you can 
turn off the ringing on each device that you’d rather be peaceful.
To make one of your iPhones, iPads, or iPod Touches stop ringing, 
turn off SettingsÆFaceTimeÆiPhone Cellular Calls. To make a Mac 
stop ringing, open the FaceTime program; choose FaceTimeÆ​
PreferencesÆSettings, and turn off iPhone Cellular Calls.
Contacts
Contacts is your address book—your master phone book.
If your social circle is longer than one screenful, then you can navigate this 
list in any of three ways:
• First, you can savor the distinct pleasure of flicking through the left-
side master list. 
• Second, if you’re in a hurry to get to the T’s, use the A-to-Z index 
down the right edge of that column. Just tap the first letter of the last 
name you’re looking for. Alternatively, you can slide your finger up or 
down the index. The list scrolls with it.
• Third, you can tap inside the search box at the top left of the screen. 
The keyboard appears. As you type, Contacts pares down the list, 
hiding everyone whose first, last, or company name doesn’t match 

Chapter 4
124
what you’ve typed so far. It’s a really fast way to pluck one name out 
of a haystack.
(You can clear the search box by tapping the ˛ at its right end, or 
restore the full list by tapping Cancel.)
In any case, when you see the name you want, tap it to open its “card” on 
the right side of the screen, filled with email addresses, phone numbers, 
and other info—and, of course, those handy Ï and C buttons for placing 
phone or FaceTime calls. 
Groups
Many computer address book programs, including OS X’s Contacts app, 
let you place your contacts into groups—subsets like Book Club or Fantasy 
League Guys. You can’t create or delete groups on the iPad, but at least 
the groups from your Mac, PC, Exchange server, or iCloud account get 
synced over to it. To see them, and to switch them all on or off at once, tap 
Groups at the top of the Contacts list.
Here’s where Groups come into play:
• If you can’t seem to find someone in the list, you may be looking in 
the wrong list. Tap Groups at the top-left corner to return to the list 
of accounts. Tap All Contacts to view a single, unified list of everyone 
your tablet knows about.

Calling & FaceTime
125
• 	If you’ve allowed your iPad to display your contacts from Facebook or 
Twitter, each of those lists is a group, too. (If your Contacts list seems 
hideously bloated with hundreds of people you never actually call, it’s 
probably your Facebook list. Pop into Groups and touch All Facebook 
to hide them all at once.)
• 	If you do use the Groups feature, remember to tap the group name 
you want before you create a new contact. That’s how you put some-
one into an existing group. (If not, tap All Contacts instead.)
Adding to the Contacts List
You don’t have to type in all your phone numbers and email addresses one 
at a time. Instead, the iPad sucks in the entire phone book from your Mac 
or PC, iCloud, and/or an Exchange server at work.
The iPad also makes it very easy to add someone’s contact information 
when she FaceTime calls, emails, or text messages you, thanks to a prom-
inent Add to Contacts button.
But if, in a pinch, on the road, at gunpoint, you have to add, edit, or remove 
a contact manually, here’s how to do it.
Make sure you’ve selected the right Group or account, as described above. 
Now, on the Contacts screen, tap n. You arrive at the New Contact screen, 
which teems with empty boxes.
It shouldn’t take you very long to figure out how to fill in this form: You 
tap in a box and type. But there are a few tips and tricks for the data-en-
try process:
•  The keyboard opens automatically when you tap in a box. And the 
iPad capitalizes the first letter of each name for you.
• Phone numbers are special. When you enter a phone number, the 
iPad adds parentheses and hyphens for you. (You can even enter text 
phone numbers, like 1-800-GO-BROWNS; the iPad converts them to 
digits when it dials.)
If you need to insert a pause—for dialing access numbers, exten-
sion numbers, or voicemail passwords—type #, which introduces a 
2-second pause in the dialing. You can type several to create longer 
pauses. 
To change the label for a number (“mobile,” “home,” “work,” and so 
on), tap the label that’s there now. The Label screen shows you your 
choices. 

Chapter 4
126
Tip: If you scroll way down the Label screen, you’ll see that you can 
also create custom labels. You might prefer someone’s cellphone 
number to be identified as “cell” instead of “mobile,” for example. Or 
you might want to create a label that says “Skype,” “Google Voice,”  
“Line 2,” “Yacht Tablet,” or “Bat Tablet.” The secret: Tap Add Custom 
Label at the very bottom of the screen.
• Expand-O-Fields mean you’ll never run out of room. Almost every 
field (empty box) on a Contacts card is infinitely expanding. That is, 
the instant you start filling in a field, another empty box (labeled add 
phone or whatever) appears right below it, so you can immediately 
add another phone number, email address, URL, street address, or 
whatever. (The only non-expanding fields are First, Last, Company, 
Ringtone, and the oddball fields you add yourself.)
For example, when you first create a card for someone, the 
phone-number box is labeled “mobile.” If you start entering a phone 
number into it, a new, second empty phone-number box appears just 
below it (labeled “iPhone”—Apple’s wishful thinking!), so you’ll have a 
place to enter a second phone number for this person. When you do 
that, a third box appears. And so on. 
There’s always one empty field, so you can never run out of places to 
add more phone numbers, addresses, and so on. (Don’t worry—the 
perpetual empty box doesn’t appear once you’re finished editing the 
person’s card.)

Calling & FaceTime
127
Note: Baffled by the ≠ button that appears next to certain fields? It 
tells you that tapping that field (or the ≠ itself) will add new lines 
to your Contact card. For example, tapping Add new address 
inserts a new name/street/city/state block. And tapping add 
field lets you add a new miscellaneous field, like Birthday or 
Department.
• You can add a photo of the person, if you like. Tap add photo. If 
you have a photo of the person already, tap Choose Photo. You’re 
taken to your photo collection, where you can find a good headshot 
(Chapter 8).
Alternatively, tap Take Photo to activate the iPad’s camera. Frame the 
person, and then tap the white camera button to snap the shot.
In any case, you wind up with the Move and Scale screen. Here you 
can frame up the photo so the person’s face is nicely sized and cen-
tered. Spread two fingers to enlarge the photo; drag your finger to 
move the image within the frame. Tap Choose to commit the photo 
to the address book’s memory. (Back on the Info screen where you 
started, a miniature version of the photo now appears. Tap edit if you 
want to change the photo, take a new one, adjust the Move and Scale 
screen, or get rid of the photo altogether.)
From now on, this photo will pop up whenever the person calls. It also 
appears next to the person’s name in your Favorites list (if you haven’t 
turned that feature off in Settings, of course).

Chapter 4
128
• Relatives are here. There’s also the social profile field, where you can 
list somebody’s Twitter, LinkedIn, Flickr, Facebook, and even Myspace 
addresses. There’s an instant message field, too, where you can record 
addresses for chat networks like AIM or Yahoo Messenger.
And there’s add related name. Here’s where you can specify this 
person’s mother, father, spouse, partner, child, manager, sibling, and so 
on—or even type in a relationship that you make up (tap Add Custom 
Label). 
NOTE: As you discovered in Chapter 3, Siri knows about all your 
relationships. You can tell her to “Call my mom” or “Text my boss.” 
• 	You can import photos from Facebook. Here’s a wild guess: Most 
of the photo boxes in your copy of Contacts are empty. After all, 
who’s going to go to the trouble of hunting down headshots of 500 
acquaintances, just for a fully illustrated Contacts list?
Fortunately, with one click, the iPad can harvest headshots from the 
world’s largest database of faces: Facebook.
Visit SettingsÆFacebook. Once you’ve signed in, you see the magical 
button: Update All Contacts. When you click it, the iPad goes on-
line for a massive research mission. Using your contacts’ names and 
phone numbers as matching criteria, it ventures off to Facebook, finds 
the profile photos of everyone who’s also on your Contacts list, and 
installs them into Contacts automatically. (If you already have a photo 
for somebody, don’t worry; it doesn’t get replaced.)
As a handy bonus, this operation also adds the @facebook.com email 
addresses for the people you already had in Contacts. 
Tip: Actually, there’s another side effect of this operation: It also adds all 
your Facebook friends’ names to your main Contacts list.
Now, you may not be crazy about this. Most of these Facebook 
folk you’ll never need to contact from your iPad—yet here they are, 
cluttering up the Contacts list.
Fortunately, the Update All Contacts button doesn’t really mix your 
Facebook friends in with your local Contacts list. It just subscribes 
to your Facebook address book—adds a new group, which you can 
turn off with one quick click; see page 125.
Even if you do choose to hide all their entries, you still get the 
benefit of the imported headshots and Facebook email addresses 
for the people you do want to see in Contacts.

Calling & FaceTime
129
• You can import Twitter addresses. In SettingsÆTwitter, the Update 
Contacts button awaits. Its purpose is to fill in the Twitter handles for 
everyone who’s already in your Contacts, matching them by phone 
number or email address.
• You can choose a ringtone. You can choose a different ringtone for 
each person in your address book. The idea is that you’ll know by the 
sound of the ring who’s calling you. 
Note: It’s one tone per person, not per phone number. Of course, if you 
really want one ringtone for your buddy’s cellphone and another 
for his home phone, you can always create a different Contacts 
card for each one.
To choose a ringtone, tap Default. On the next screen, tap any sound 
in the Ringtones or Alert Sounds lists to sample them. (Despite the 
separate lists, in this context, these sounds are all being offered as 
ringtones.) When you’ve settled on a good one, tap Done to return to 
the Info screen where you started.
• You can also pick a text-message sound. Just as you can choose 
sounds for incoming calls, the text tone item lets you choose sounds 
for incoming text messages and FaceTime invitations.
• You can add new fields of your own. Very cool: If you tap add field 
at the bottom of the screen, then you go down the rabbit hole into 
Field Land, where you can add any of 15 additional info bits about the 
person whose card you’re editing: a prefix (like Mr. or Mrs.), a suffix 
(like M.D. or Esq.), a nickname, a job title, a birthday, an instant mes-
sage address, a phonetic pronunciation for people with weird names, 
and so on. 
When you tap one of these labels, you return to the Info screen, 
where you’ll see that the iPad has inserted the new, empty field in the 
most intelligent spot. For example, if you add a phonetic first name, 
that box appears just below the First Name box. The keyboard opens 
so you can fill in the blank.
• You can link and unlink Unified Contacts. As noted earlier, your tablet 
can sync up with different accounts. Your Contacts app might list four 
sets of names and numbers: one stored on your tablet, one from an 
iCloud account, one from Facebook, and a fourth from your corporate 
Exchange server at work. In the old days, therefore, certain names 
might have shown up in the All Contacts list two or three times—not 
an optimal situation.

Chapter 4
130
Now, as a favor to you, the iPad displays each person’s name only 
once in that master All Contacts list. If you tap that name, you open 
up a unified information screen for that person. It includes all the de-
tails from all the underlying cards from that person.
Note: The iPad combines cards in the All Contacts list only if the first 
and last names are exactly the same. If there’s a difference in 
name, suffix, prefix, or middle name, no unifying takes place. 
Remember, too, that you see the unification only if you view the 
All Contacts list.
To see which cards the iPad is combining for you, scroll to the bottom 
of the card. There the Linked Contacts section shows you which cards 
have been unified.
Here you can tap a listing to open the card in the corresponding ac-
count. For that matter, you can manually link a card, too; tap Edit, tap 
link contacts, and then choose a contact to link to this unified card—
even if the name isn’t a perfect match. 
Note: It’s OK to link Joe Carnelia’s card with Joseph Carnelia’s card—
they’re probably the same person. But don’t link up different 
people’s cards. Remember, the whole point is to make the iPad 
combine all the phone numbers, email addresses, and so on 
onto a single card—and seeing two sets on one card could get 
confusing fast.
This stuff gets complex. But, in general, the iPad tries to do the 
right thing. For example, if you edit the information on the unified 
card, you’re changing that information only on the card in the cor-
responding account. (Unless you add information to the unified 
card. In that case, the new data tidbit is added to all the underlying 
source-account cards.)
Note: To delete any info bit from a Contacts card, tap the – next to it, 
and then tap the red Delete button to confirm.
Editing Someone
To make corrections or changes, tap the person’s name in the Contacts 
list. In the upper-right corner of the Info card, tap Edit.
You return to the screens already described, where you can make changes. 
To edit a phone number, for example, tap it and change away. Or, to delete 
a number (or any other info bit), tap the – button next to it, and then tap 
Delete to confirm.

Calling & FaceTime
131
After you tap Done (or Cancel), you can return to the Contacts list by 
swiping to the right.
Deleting Someone
Truth is, you’ll probably add people to your address book far more often 
than you’ll delete them. After all, you meet new people all the time—but 
you delete people primarily when they die, move away, or dump you. 
To zap someone, tap the name in the Contacts list and then tap Edit. Scroll 
down, tap Delete Contact, and confirm by tapping Delete Contact again. 
Sharing a Contact
There’s a lot of work involved in entering someone’s contact information. 
It would be thoughtful, therefore, if you could spare the next guy all that 
effort—by sending a fully formed electronic business card to him. It can be 
yours or that of anyone in your Contacts list.
To do that, open the contact’s card, find the bottom, and tap Share Contact. 
On the Share sheet, you’re offered a choice of AirDrop, Message, Mail, and 
More. (“Message” means an iMessage—page 125—if it’s a fellow Apple 
fan, or a text message otherwise. AirDrop is described on page 121. And 
More is a place for new apps to install their sharing options.)
Tap your choice, address the message (to an email address or, for a mes-
sage, a cellphone number), and send it. The recipient, assuming he has a 
half-decent smartphone or address-book program on the receiving end, 
can install that person’s information with a single tap on the attachment. 
Tip: Ever meet someone and wish you could just exchange business 
cards electronically, iPad to iPad? AirDrop is the answer.
Bluetooth Accessories
Bluetooth is a short-range cable elimination technology. It’s designed to 
untether you from equipment that would ordinarily require a cord. 
On an iPad, Bluetooth is primarily useful for transmitting audio to a wire-
less speaker—and for sending your calls to Bluetooth car stereos and tiny 
wireless Bluetooth earpieces.
Note: This discussion covers monaural Bluetooth earpieces intended 
for phone calls. But the iPad can also handle Bluetooth stereo 
headphones, intended for music, as well as Bluetooth speakers. 
Details are on page 188.

Chapter 4
132
Pairing with a Bluetooth Earpiece or Speaker
Pairing means “marrying” a phone or tablet to a Bluetooth earpiece or 
speaker so that each works only with the other. If you didn’t do this one-
time pairing, then some other guy passing on the sidewalk might hear your 
conversation through his earpiece. And neither of you would be happy.
The pairing process is different for every tablet and every Bluetooth ear-
piece. Usually it involves a sequence like this:
1.	 On the earpiece, turn on Bluetooth. Make the earpiece or speaker 
discoverable. Discoverable just means that your iPad can “see” it. 
You’ll have to consult the gadget’s instructions to learn how to do so; 
it’s usually a matter of holding down some button or combination of 
buttons until the earpiece blinks.
2.	 On the iPad, tap SettingsÆBluetooth. 
Turn Bluetooth on. The iPad immediately 
begins searching for nearby Bluetooth 
equipment. If all goes well, you’ll see the 
name of your earpiece or speaker show 
up on the screen.
3.	 Tap the gadget’s name. Type in the 
passcode, if necessary. The passcode is 
a number, usually four or six digits, that 
must be typed into the tablet within 
about a minute. You have to enter this 
only once, during the initial pairing pro-
cess. The idea is to prevent some evildoer sitting nearby in the airport 
lounge, for example, to secretly pair his earpiece with your iPad. 
The user’s manual for your earpiece should tell you what the pass-
code is (if one is even required).
Note: The trouble with Bluetooth has always been that it’s a battery 
hog. Now, though, there’s a new, better technology, alternately 
called Bluetooth LE (for “low energy”), Bluetooth Smart, 
or Bluetooth 4.0. Its very smart idea: It turns on only when 
necessary and then turns off again to save power. 
When you’ve paired your iPad with a Bluetooth 4.0 gadget, you’ll 
see the Bluetooth logo on your status bar (b) light up only when 
it’s actually exchanging data. Bluetooth LE has made possible a 
lot of smartwatches and fitness trackers.
As a handy bonus, Bluetooth LE devices don’t have to be paired 
in the iPad’s Settings app. Often, you can do the pairing right in 
the gadget’s companion app, which makes a lot more sense.

Calling & FaceTime
133
To make FaceTime calls using a Bluetooth earpiece (or speaker as a speak-
erphone), you dial using the iPad itself. You usually use the iPad’s own 
volume controls, too. You generally press a button on the earpiece or the 
speaker itself to answer an incoming call, to swap call-waiting calls, and to 
end a call.
If you’re having any problems making a particular gadget work, Google it. 
Type “iPad jambox mini,” for example. Chances are good that you’ll find a 
write-up by somebody who’s worked through the setup and made it work.
Bluetooth Car Systems
The iPad works beautifully with Bluetooth car systems, too. The pairing pro-
cedure generally goes exactly as described above: You make the car dis-
coverable, enter the passcode on the iPad, and then make the connection.
Once you’re paired up, you can answer an incoming call by pressing a 
button on your steering wheel, for example. You hear your caller through 
the car’s speakers, and a microphone for your own voice is hidden in the 
rearview mirror or dashboard. You make calls either from the iPad or, in 
some cars, by dialing the number on the car’s own touchscreen.
Note: When Bluetooth is turned on but the earpiece isn’t, or when the 
earpiece isn’t nearby, the b icon on your iPad’s status bar appears 
in gray. And when it’s connected and working right, the earpiece’s 
battery gauge appears on the iPad’s status bar.
Of course, studies show that it’s the act of driving while conversing that 
causes accidents—not actually holding a phone. So the hands-free system 
is less for safety than for convenience and compliance with state laws.

O
nce you’ve savored the exhilaration of making phone calls on 
the iPad, you’re ready to graduate to one of its fancier tricks: 
text messages. There are two kinds: traditional (for sending 
messages to cellphones) and Apple-flavored (for sending messages to 
other Apple equipment).
Of course, in order to send any kind of message, your iPad has to be 
online; it has to be in a WiFi hotspot or (if you have a cellular iPad) it has 
to have cell service.
Text Messages (SMS)
SMS stands for Short Messaging Service, but it’s commonly just called 
texting. A text message is a very short note (under 160 characters—a sen-
tence or two) that you shoot from one device to another. What’s so great 
about it?
• 	Like a phone call, it’s immediate. You get the message off your chest 
right now.
• 	As with email, the recipient doesn’t have to answer immediately. The 
message waits for him even when his phone or tablet is turned off.
• 	Unlike a phone call, it’s nondisruptive. You can send someone a text 
message without worrying that he’s in a movie, a meeting, or any-
where else where holding a phone up to his head and talking would 
be frowned upon. (And the other person can answer nondisruptively, 
too, by sending a text message back.) 
• 	You have a written record of the exchange. There’s no mistaking 
what the person meant. (Well, at least not because of sound quality. 
Understanding the texting shorthand that’s evolved—“C U 2mrO,” and 
so on—is another matter entirely.) 
Texting & 
iMessages

Chapter 5
136
• You can send pictures and videos in text messages, too. They’re 
sometimes called MMS, or multimedia messaging service. 
It’s an unassailable fact: Your iPad doesn’t have its own phone number. 
Therefore, it shouldn’t be able to send and receive texts.
Fortunately, it can, using any of three methods:
• iMessages. Whenever your iPad is online, it can send and receive 
unlimited free messages to other Apple gadgets (iPhones, iPads, iPod 
Touches, Macs).
• Via iPhone. When your iPad is on the same WiFi hotspot as your 
iPhone, you can send real, actual SMS text messages to and from 
other phones of any brand. (It’s the same trick that you can use to 
make phone calls, as described on page 122.)
• Using an app. Certain apps give your iPad a phone number, so you 
can send and receive actual text messages whenever you’re online.
This chapter covers these three methods one at a time.
iMessages
This iOS feature should interest you—if it doesn’t, in fact, make you giggle 
like a schoolgirl.
An iMessage looks and works exactly like a text message, of the sort you 
might send on a cellphone. You send iMessages and receive them in the 
same app (Messages). They show up in the same window. You can send 
the same kinds of things: text, photos, videos, contacts, map locations, 
whatever. You send and receive them using exactly the same techniques. 
The big difference? iMessages go exclusively between Apple products: 
iPads, iPhones, iPod Touches, and Macs.
So why would Apple reinvent the text-messaging wheel? Because iMes-
sages offer some huge advantages over regular text messages:
• 	iMessages are free! You don’t have to pay for them. They look and 
work exactly like text messages, but they’re transferred over the 
Internet (WiFi or, on a cellular iPad, cellular) instead of your cell com-
pany’s voice airwaves.
• 	When you’re typing back and forth with somebody, you don’t have 
to wonder whether, during a silence, he’s typing a response to you or 
just ignoring you; when he’s typing a response, you see an ellipsis (…), 
as shown on the next page.

Texting
137
• 	You don’t have to wonder if the other guy has received your message. 
A tiny, light-gray word “Delivered” appears under each message you 
send, briefly, to let you know that the other guy’s device received it.
• 	You can even turn on a “read receipt” feature that lets the other guy 
know when you’ve actually seen a message he sent. He’ll see a nota-
tion that says, for example, “Read: 2:34 PM.”
• 	Your history of iMessages shows up on all your i-gadgets; they’re 
synchronized through your iCloud account. In other words, you can 
start a chat with somebody using your iPad and later pick up your 
Mac laptop at home and carry right on from where you stopped (in 
its Messages program).
As a result, you always have a record of your iMessages. You have a 
copyable, searchable transcript on your computer.
• 	In iOS 8, iMessages can be more than text. They can be little audio 
recordings, video recordings, or photos that you take on the spot, 
within the Messages app.
Sending an iMessage
iMessages happen automatically. All you do is open Messages and create 
a text message as usual. If your recipient is using an Apple gadget (with 
iOS 5 or later, or a Mac using OS X Mountain Lion or later)…and has an 
iCloud account…and hasn’t turned off iMessages, then your iPad sends 
your message as an iMessage automatically. It somehow knows.

Chapter 5
138
You’ll know, too, because the light-gray text in the typing box says “iMes-
sage.” And each message you send shows up in a blue speech bubble. The 
Send button is blue, too.
In fact, when you’re addressing the new text message, the names that 
appear in blue represent people with iMessages gadgets, so you know in 
advance who’s cool and who’s not (previous page). (The green names are 
those who do not have iMessage. The gray ones—well, your iPad doesn’t 
know yet.)
Receiving an iMessage
When you get an iMessage, the iPad plays a sound. It’s a shiny glockenspiel 
ding, unless you’ve changed the standard sound or assigned a different 
text tone to this specific person.
The iPad also displays the name of the sender and the message. Unless 
you’ve fooled around with the Notifications settings, the message appears 
at the top of the screen, disappearing momentarily on its own, so as not to 
interrupt what you’re doing. (You can also flick it up and away if it’s block-
ing something on your screen.)
Or, if the iPad was asleep, it lights up long enough to display the mes-
sage right on its Unlock screen (below). You can unlock the iPad and jump 
directly to the message by swiping your finger right across the message 
on the Lock screen.
If you have changed the options in Notifications, then your text message 
might appear in a white bubble in the center of the screen, complete with 
Close and Reply buttons. If you turned off Show Preview (page 150), 
then you don’t see the message itself—only the name or number of the 
sender. And if you’ve turned off View in Lock Screen, then, sure enough, 
the text message does not appear on the Lock screen.

Texting
139
Tip: The Messages icon on the Home screen bears a little circled number 
“badge” letting you know how many new messages are waiting for 
you.
Once you tap a message notification to open, you see Apple’s vision of 
what a text-message conversation should look like. Incoming messages 
and your replies are displayed as though they’re cartoon speech balloons 
(page 137).
To respond to the message, tap in the text box at the bottom of the screen. 
The iPad keyboard appears. Type away, or dictate a response, and then 
tap Send. 
If your buddy replies, then the balloon-chat continues, scrolling up the 
screen.
And now, a selection of juicy iMessage tips:
• The last 50 exchanges appear here. If you want to see even older 
ones, scroll to the very top (which you can do by tapping the top 
edge of the screens) and then drag downward.
And by the way—if the keyboard is blocking your view of the conver-
sation, swipe downward on the messages to hide it.
• Links that people send you in text messages actually work. For 
example, if someone sends you a Web address, tap to open it in 
Safari. If someone sends a street address, tap it to open it in Maps. 
And if someone sends an email address, tap it to open an outgoing 
message.
• Messages remembers the exact time that each text was sent or 
received. If you slide your finger leftward and hold it still, this hidden 
column of time stamps slides into view. Release your finger to snap 
them back.
Five Clever Options
In iOS 8, a new screen offers five options that you may find handy in the 
midst of a texting conversation. To see them, tap Details at the top of the 
screen. Here’s what you see now:
• Call. If all this fussy typing is driving you nuts, you can jump onto a 
phone or video call. On the Details screen, a little strip of icons awaits. 
They include C (conclude the transaction by voice, with a FaceTime 
audio call), Ï (place a FaceTime video call), and * (open this 
person’s full Contacts card, loaded with different ways to call, text, or 
email).

Chapter 5
140
• Send My Current Location (now). Hit this button to transmit a map to 
the other person, showing exactly where you are, so that person can 
come and pick you up, meet you for drinks, rescue you when your car 
doesn’t start, or whatever. 
If your correspondent has an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, she can open the 
map you’ve sent in Maps, ready to guide her with driving directions. If 
she’s one of the unenlightened—she owns some non-Apple phone—
then she gets what’s called a Location vCard, which she may be able 
to open into a mapping app on her own phone.
Note: If Location Services isn’t turned on (page 481), the iPad may 
ask you to turn it on now. After all, you can’t very well share your 
location if your phone has no idea where you are.
• Share My Location (continuously). If you’re moving around, and 
you have a cellular-model iPad, you may prefer this option. It sends 
your whereabouts to your correspondent—and keeps that location 
updated as you meander through the city, for a period of time that 
you specify (One Hour, Until End of Day, or Indefinitely). That’s great 
when you’re club-hopping, say, and trying to help some buddies catch 
up with you. As your location changes, the map you sent to your 
recipient updates itself.
At any time—even before the hour, day, or eternity is up—you can 
stop broadcasting your location to this person; just open the Details 
screen again and tap Stop Sharing My Location.
• Do Not Disturb. Otherwise known as “mute,” “enough already,” or 
“shut up.” It makes your tablet stop ringing or responding with every 
new message from this person or group. Handy when you’re trying to 
get work done, when you’re being bombarded by silly group chitchat, 
or when someone’s stalking you.
• Attachments. Crazy cool! Here are all the photos and other attach-
ments you’ve ever exchanged with this texting correspondent, going 
back to forever. 
You can tap one of these tiles to open it. Or, if you hold your finger 
down on it, you get choices like Copy, Delete, and More. (There’s 
usually nothing new under More except Save Image, which copies the 
texted photo into your Photos collection.)

Texting
141
The Text List
What’s cool is that the iPad retains all these exchanges. You can review 
them or resume them at any time by tapping Messages on the Home 
screen. A list of text message conversations appears; a blue dot indicates 
conversations that contain new messages (next page, right).
Tip: If you’ve sent a message to a certain group of people, you can 
address a new note to the same group by tapping the old message’s 
row here.
503 delete en masse
The truth is, these listings represent people, not conversations. For exam-
ple, if you had a message exchange with Chris last week, then a quick way 
to send a new text message to Chris (even on a totally different subject) is 
to open that “conversation” and simply send a “reply.” The iPad saves you 
the administrative work of creating a new message, choosing a recipient, 
and so on.
Tip: Hey, you can search text messages! At the very top of the list, 
there’s a search box. You can actually find text inside your message 
collection.

Chapter 5
142
If having these old exchanges hanging around presents a security (or mar-
ital) risk, you can delete them in either of two ways:
• Delete an entire conversation. Swipe away the conversation. At the 
list of conversations, swipe your finger leftward across the conversa-
tion’s name. That makes the Delete confirmation button appear.
Alternate method: Above the Messages list, tap Edit, tap to select (l) 
the conversations you want to ditch, and then tap the Delete button.
• Delete just one text. Open the conversation so that you’re viewing 
the cascade of bubbles representing the texts back and forth.
Now, this technique is a little weird, but here goes: Hold down your 
finger on the individual message you want to delete (or double-tap 
it). When the little black bar of options appears, tap More. 
Now you can delete all the exchanges simultaneously (tap Delete 
All) or vaporize only particularly incriminating messages. To do that, 
tap the selection circles for the individual balloons you want to nuke, 
putting checks (l) by them; then tap the T button to delete them all 
at once. Tap Delete Message to confirm.
Note: Interestingly, you can also forward some messages you’ve 
selected in this way. When you tap the Forward button (^), a 
new outgoing text message appears, ready for you to specify the 
new recipient.

Texting
143
Mark All as Read
Here’s a handy new option in iOS 8: When you get off the plane, home 
from your honeymoon, you might see Messages bristling with notifications 
about messages you missed. Now you can mark them all as read at once, 
so the blue dots don’t distract you anymore.
To do that, on the message-list screen, tap Edit, then Read All.
Sending a New Message
If you want to text somebody you’ve texted before, the quickest way, as 
noted above, is simply to resume one of the “conversations” already listed 
in the Messages list.
You can also tap a person’s name in Contacts, or * next to a listing in 
Recents or Favorites, to open the Info screen; tap Send Message. 
Actually, options to fire off text messages lurk all over the iPad—anytime 
you see the Share (P) button, which is frequently. The resulting Share 
screen includes options like Email, Twitter, Facebook—and Message. 
Tapping Message sends you back to Messages, where the photo, video, 
page, or other item is ready to send. (More on multimedia messages 
shortly.)
In other words, sending a text message to anyone who lives in your iPad is 
only a couple of taps away.
Note: You can tap that ± button to add another recipient for this same 
message. Repeat as necessary; they’ll all get the same message.
Yet another way to start: Tap the √ button at the top of the Messages 
screen.
In any case, the message composition screen is waiting for you now. You’re 
ready to type (or dictate) and send!
Tip: If you drag your finger down the screen, you hide the keyboard. 
Doing that makes much more of the screen available to display the 
text-message conversation.
Picture, Audio, or Video Messages
To send a photo or a video by iMessage, tap the s next to the box where 
you type your messages. Three useful options appear:
• Recent photos. First, you see a scrolling row of the most recent pho-
tos and videos added on your iPad. This new iOS 8 feature is incred-
ibly smart; it should be obvious that most of the time, the photo you 

Chapter 5
144
want to send by text is one of the last ones you took. Tap a photo 
here—or more than one—and tap Send 1 Photo (or whatever the num-
ber is.) 
Tip: You can scroll these photo miniatures to the left to see the older 
ones.
• Photo Library. To transmit a photo or video that’s already on your 
iPad (but not one of the most recent), you can tap Photo Library; 
your Photos app opens automatically, showing all your photos and 
videos, as described in Chapter 8. Tap the one you want, and then tap 
Choose. 
• Take Photo or Video opens the Camera app so that you can take 
a new picture or snag a video clip. It’s just like the Camera app 
described in Chapter 8, except that only two modes are available: 
Video and Photo.
Once you’ve captured the shot (or the clip), you can choose either 
Retake (if the result was no good) or Use Photo (if you want to send 
it). Then hit Send.
You now return to your message conversation in progress—but now 
that photo or video appears inside the Send box. Type a caption or a 
comment, if you like. Then tap Send to fire it off to your buddy. 

Texting
145
Capturing Messages and Files
In general, text messages are fleeting; most people have no idea how they 
might capture them and save them forever. 
Some of the stuff in those text messages is easy to capture, though. For 
example, if you’re on the receiving end of a photo or a video, tap the small 
preview in the speech bubble. It opens at full-screen size so you can have 
a better look at it—and if it’s a video, there’s a ÷ button so you can play it. 
Either way, if the picture or video is good enough to preserve, tap the P 
button. You’re offered a Save Image or Save Video button; tap to add the 
photo or video to your iPad’s collection.
If someone sends you contact information (a phone number, for example), 
you can add it to your address book. Just tap inside that bubble and then 
tap either Create New Contact or Add to Existing Contact.
If you’d like to preserve the actual text messages, you have a few options:
• Copy them individually. Double-tap a text bubble, and then tap Copy. 
At this point, you can paste that one message into, for example, an 
email message.
• Forward them. Double-tap a message to make the button bar appear. 
Tap More, and then tap the selection dots beside all the messages 
you want to pass on. Now you can tap the Forward (^) button. All 
the selected messages go along for the ride in a single consolidated 
message to a new text-message addressee.
• Save the iMessages. If you have a Mac, then your iMessages (that is, 
notes to and from other Apple gadgets) show up in the Messages 
chat program. You can save them or copy them there.
TIP: Behind the scenes, the Mac stores all your chat transcripts in a 
hidden folder, as special text files. To get there, press the Option key 
as you open the Go menu; choose GoÆLibrary. The transcripts are 
in date-stamped folders in the MessagesÆArchive folder.
• Use an app. There’s no built-in way to save regular text messages in 
bulk. There are, however, apps that can do this for you, like DiskAid 
(for Windows) or iBackup Viewer (free for the Mac). They work from 
the invisible backup files that you create when you sync your phone 
with iTunes.

Instant Audio, Video, and Photos
In iOS 8, some new controls are available whenever you’re exchanging 
iMessages. As in super-popular apps like WhatsApp, they let you quickly 
exchange audio, video, or still pictures as easily as you’d type something.
Yes, of course, you’ve always been able to send multimedia goodies while 
texting. The difference in iOS 8 is the convenience of doing so; you can 
record and send a picture, video, or audio clip with a single slide of your 
thumb. It’s so effortless that the process is transformed.
It goes like this.
Audio Texting: The New Walkie-Talkie
Hold your finger down on the ﬁ button at the right end of the Messages 
text box. At the sound of the ding, say something—and then slide your 
finger upward to the : button. What you said is instantly transmitted to 
your buddy as an audio recording. You don’t have to fuss with a bunch of 
Start, Stop, or Send buttons. 
It’s a whole new form of quick exchanges—something that combines the 
best of a walkie-talkie (instant audio) with the best of text messages (you 
can listen and reply at your leisure).
Sometimes, an audio recording is just better than a typed message, espe-
cially when music, a child, an animal, or a lot of emotion in your voice 
is involved. You could probably argue that audio texting is also better 
than typed texting when you’re driving, jogging, or operating industrial 
machinery.

Texting
147
Now then: That business about holding down the ﬁ button, talking, and 
then sliding up is probably how you’ll always do it—once you become 
friends with this feature. But, at the outset, you can proceed more 
cautiously. 
If, after speaking, you simply lift your finger from the glass, you can tap 2 
to review your recording before sending it. Or you can tap the < to cancel 
the whole thing. 
But, really, it’s that hold down/speak/slide up business that makes audio 
transmissions so much fun.
TIP: Audio eats up a lot more space on your tablet than text. If you do a 
lot of audio messaging, then, over time, those audio snippets can fill 
up your storage.
That’s why iOS 8 comes set to delete every audio message 
2 minutes after you send or receive it. If that prospect worries you, 
then visit SettingsÆMessages. You can tap Expire and change that 
setting to Never. 
Even if you don’t change this setting, you’re free to preserve 
especially good audio messages forever; just tap the tiny Keep 
button that appears below each one.
Video Messaging
To the left of the typing box, there’s a little › icon. If you tap it, you’re 
offered the chance to take a photo or choose an existing one.
But if you hold your finger down on this ›, the recording palette appears, 
and you can take a video clip and send it instantly. In slow motion, the pro-
cess goes like this:
1.	 Hold your finger down on the ›. When the recording palette 
appears, you can lift your finger.
NOTE: In iOS 8.1, the recording palette appears only when the iPad 
is upright (in portrait orientation)—not when you’re holding it 
sideways (landscape).
2.	 Tap the ∆ button. Now you’re recording video. Tap S to stop.
TIP: If you prefer, you can just hold down the ∆ for as long as you want 
to record; stop by lifting your finger.
3.	 Tap the 2 to play back your video for review, or tap : to send it. 

Chapter 5
148
Now, all of that is the slow, timid way to send a video. Once you get the 
hang of it, you can do it all with a single finger motion, like this:
Hold your finger down on the ›. Without lifting your finger, slide onto the 
∆ to record video. Still without lifting, slide onto the : and release. The 
phone sends the freshly recorded video. 
That method is so smooth and continuous that it makes video snippets 
a seamless part of the texting conversation. It also puts you in a better 
position to capture video of things that happen suddenly and instantly—a 
plane landing in the Hudson River, say.
NOTE: Like audio snippets, video clips consume a lot of phone storage. 
So here again, iOS 8 ordinarily deletes video messages 2 minutes 
after you send or receive them. You can, if you prefer, tap 
SettingsÆ​MessagesÆ​Expire and change that setting to Never. 
Even if you don’t change the setting, you can always hang onto 
certain video messages; tap the tiny Keep button that appears 
below them.
Photo Messaging
You already know what happens when you tap the › button: The iPad 
lets you take, or choose, a photo to send. 
But if you hold your finger down on that button, you can take and transmit 
photos with a single finger swipe, too. Once again, here’s the slow version:
1.	 Hold your finger down on the ›. When the recording palette 
appears, you can lift your finger.

Texting
149
2.	 Aim the camera, and then tap ›. The phone snaps the picture and 
sends it, all at once.
As you get better, you can do it all in one quick motion: Hold your finger 
on the s, aim the camera, slide up to the : button, and let go. Snap and 
send.
TIP: The › on the recording palette doesn’t give you the chance to 
review the photo before you snap it. If you prefer that method, 
then tap the › icon instead of holding it down, and proceed as 
described on page 143.
iMessage Settings
If you tap SettingsÆMessages, you’ll stumble upon some intriguing mes-
saging options:
• iMessage. This is the on/off switch for the entire iMessages feature. 
It’s hard to imagine why you wouldn’t want this feature available, but 
you know—whatever floats your boat.
• Send Read Receipts. When you turn this option on, your iMessage 
correspondents will know when you’ve seen their messages. A tiny 
word “Read” will appear beneath each sent message that you’ve 
actually seen. Turn this off only if it deprives you of the excuse for not 
responding promptly (“Hey, I never even saw your message!”).
• Send & Receive. Tap here to specify what cellphone numbers and 
email addresses you want to register with iMessages. (Your laptop, 
iPad, and iPod Touch do not have phone numbers, which is why iMes-
sages gives you the option of using an email address.)
When people send iMessages to you, they can use any of the num-
bers or addresses you turn on here. That’s the only time these num-
bers and addresses matter. You see the same messages exactly the 
same way on all your Apple gadgets, no matter what email address or 
phone number the sender used for you.
(If you scroll down on this screen, you’ll see the Start new conversa-
tions from options. This is where you specify which number or ad-
dress others will see when you initiate the message. It really doesn’t 
make much difference which one you choose.)
• Keep Messages. How long do you want your messages to hang 
around on your phone? This is a question of privacy, of storage, and 
of your personality. In any case, here’s where you get a choice of 30 
Days, 1 Year, or Forever.

Chapter 5
150
• Expire. As noted on page 147, iOS 8 ordinarily deletes audio and 
video messages a couple of minutes after they arrive, to avoid filling 
up your iPad with old, no longer relevant audio and video files. The 
two Expire controls here let you turn off that automatic deletion (by 
choosing Never).
Bonus Settings in a Place You Didn’t Expect
Apple has stashed a few important text-messaging settings in SettingsÆ​
NotificationsÆ​Messages:
• Allow Notifications. If, in a cranky burst of sensory overload, you want 
your iPad to stop telling you when new texts come in (with a banner 
or sound, for example), then turn this off.
• Show in Notification Center. How many recent text messages should 
appear in the Notification Center (page 42)?
• Notification Sound. Tap here to choose a sound for incoming texts to 
play. (You can also choose a different sound for each person in your 
address book, as described on page 129.) 
• Badge App Icon. Would you like a little number like this @ to appear 
on the Message app’s icon, showing how many you’ve missed?
• Show on Lock Screen. Do you want received text messages and iMes-
sages to appear on the screen when it’s locked? If yes, then you can 
sneak reassuring glances at your tablet without turning it fully on. If 
no, then you maintain better protection against snoopers who find 
your iPad on your desk.
• Alert Style When Unlocked. See page 46 for a description of the 
different banner styles.
• Show Preview. Usually, when a message arrives, it wakes up your iPad 
and shows the message contents. Which is great, as long as the mes-
sage isn’t private and the tablet isn’t lying on the table where every-
one can see it. If you turn off Show Preview, though, you’ll see who 
the message is from but not the actual text of the message (until you 
tap the notification banner or bubble). 
• Show Alerts from. This option is designed to give you some con-
trol over the flood of attention-getting bubbles that appear on your 
screen. If you choose My Contacts, then you won’t get that chime and 
bubble when total strangers send iMessages to you.
• Repeat Alerts. If someone sends you a text message but you don’t 
tap or swipe to read it, the iPad waits 2 minutes, and then plays the 

Texting
151
notification sound again. That second chance really helps when, for 
example, you were in a noisy place and missed the original chime.
But for some people, even one additional reminder isn’t enough. 
Here you can specify that you want to be re-alerted Twice, 3 Times, 5 
Times, or 10 Times. (Or Never, if you don’t want repeated alerts at all.)
Regular Text Messages
Most iPads, most of the time, never send anything but iMessages. They 
never communicate with any devices except Apple’s.
It is possible, however, for your iPad to exchange regular SMS text mes-
sages with regular phones—if you also own an iPhone. Once again, your 
iPhone acts as a relay station between the cellular world and your iPad.
Here’s how to set it up. First, as usual, the iPad and the phone must be on 
the same WiFi network and signed into the same iCloud account. Next, on 
the iPhone, open SettingsÆMessages. Turn on Text Message Forwarding 
next to your iPad’s name.
On the iPad, open Messages; a code appears. You’re supposed to type into 
the corresponding box on your phone:
This same code appears right now on any iPad, Mac, or iPod Touch you 
own. They, too, will be able to send and receive texts, with your iPhone 
doing the relaying. 
All of this is to prove, really and truly, that you’re the owner of both devices. 
You wouldn’t want some bad guy reading your text messages, would you?
That’s it—your gadgets are paired. You can now use Messages to send 
standard text messages to any cellphone. You can also tap and hold on 
a phone number wherever it appears—in Contacts, in a Spotlight search 
result, in Safari, in Mail—and choose Send Message from there. And when 
On the iPhone
On the iPad

Chapter 5
152
a text message comes in, a standard iPad notification bubble appears at 
top right.
The beauty of all this is that your back-and-forths are kept in sync between 
the iPad and the phone. You can jump between them and continue the 
text­ing conversation. (You’ll note that, as usual, the bubbles containing 
your utterances are green. Blue is reserved for iMessages—that is, mes-
sages to other people with iCloud accounts.)
Text Messages Using Apps
OK, so what if you want to send text messages from your iPad to normal 
phones (not just iPhones)—and you don’t have an iPhone to use as a relay 
station? You’re still not out of luck.
There are all kinds of sneaky apps that let you send SMS texts for free that 
don’t require your correspondents to have an Apple device. Here are a 
couple of examples:
• Textfree with Voice. It’s an app that gives your iPad its own phone 
number just for free text or picture messages, so you can send and 
receive all you want without paying a cent. Incoming voice calls are 
free, too; you can buy minutes for outgoing calls.
• Google Voice. This free service has a million great features. But one 
of the best is that it lets you send and receive free text messages. You 
can do that from your computer (an amazingly useful feature, actu-
ally) at voice.google.com, or by using the free Google Voice app).

I
f you were told that the iPad was an easy tablet for a disabled person 
to use, you might spew your coffee. The thing has almost no physical 
keys! How would a blind person use it? Lots of features require swip-
ing across the screen or holding something down. How would someone 
with motor-control challenges work it?
But it’s true. Apple has gone to incredible lengths to make the iPad usable 
for people with vision, hearing, or other physical impairments. As a handy 
side effect, these features also can be fantastically useful to people whose 
only impairment is being under 10 or over 40.
If you’re blind, you can actually turn the screen off and operate every-
thing—do your email, surf the Web, adjust settings, run apps—by letting 
the iPad speak what you’re touching. It’s pretty amazing (and it doubles 
the battery life).
You can also magnify the screen, reverse black for white (for better-contrast 
reading), and convert stereo music to mono (great if you’re deaf in one 
ear). 
Some of these features are useful even if you’re not disabled—in particular, 
the LED flash and zooming. The kiosk mode is great for kids; it prevents 
them from exiting whatever app they’re using. And if you have aging eyes, 
you might find the Large Text option especially handy.
Here’s a rundown of the accessibility features in iOS 8. To turn on any of 
the features described here, open SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibility. (And 
don’t forget about Siri, described in Chapter 3. She may be the best friend 
a blind person’s iPad ever had.)
Tip: You can turn many of the iPad’s accessibility features on and off 
with a triple-click on the Home button. See page 172 for details.

VoiceOver
VoiceOver is a screen reader—software that makes the iPad speak every-
thing you touch. It’s a fairly important feature if you’re blind.
On the VoiceOver settings pane, tap the on/off switch to turn VoiceOver 
on. Because VoiceOver radically changes the way you control your iPad, 
you must dismiss a warning to confirm that you know what you’re doing. 
Immediately, you hear a female voice begin reading the names of the con-
trols she sees on the screen. 
You can adjust the Speaking Rate of the synthesized voice. 
Now you’re ready to start using the iPad in VoiceOver mode. There’s a lot 
to learn, and practice makes perfect, but here’s the overview:
• Touch something to hear it. Tap icons, words, even status icons 
at the top; as you go, the voice tells you what you’re tapping. 
“Messages.” “Calendar.” “Mail—14 new items.” “45 percent battery 
power.”  You can tap the dots on the Home screen, and you’ll hear 
“Page 3 of 9.” 
Once you’ve tapped a screen element, you can also flick your finger 
left or right—anywhere on the screen—to “walk” through everything 
on the screen, left to right, top to bottom.
Tip: A thin black rectangle appears around whatever the voice is 
identifying. That’s for the benefit of sighted people who might be 
helping you.
• Double-tap something to “tap” it. Ordinarily, you tap something on 
the screen to open it. But since single-tapping now means “speak 
this,” you need a new way to open everything. So: To open something 
you’ve just heard identified, double-tap anywhere on the screen. (You 
don’t have to wait for the voice to finish talking.)
Tip: Or do a split tap. Tap something to hear what it is—and with that 
finger still down, tap somewhere else with a different finger to open it.
There are all kinds of other special gestures in VoiceOver. Make the voice 
stop speaking with a two-finger tap; read everything, in sequence, from 
the top of the screen with a two-finger upward flick; scroll one page at 
a time with a three-finger flick up or down; go to the next or previous 
screen (Home, Stocks, and so on) with a three-finger flick left or right; 
and more. 

Accessibility
155
Or try turning on Screen Curtain with a three-finger triple-tap; it blacks 
out the screen, giving you total privacy as well as a heck of a battery 
boost. (Repeat to turn the screen back on.)
On the VoiceOver settings screen, you’ll find an expanded wealth of 
options for using the iPad sightlessly. For example:
• Speak Hints makes the iPad give you additional suggestions for oper-
ating something you’ve tapped. For example, instead of just saying, 
“Safari,” it says, “Safari. Double-tap to open.” 
• Use Pitch Change makes the iPad talk in a higher voice when you’re 
entering letters and a lower voice when you’re deleting them. It also 
uses a higher pitch when speaking the first item of a list and a lower 
one when speaking the last item. In both cases, this option is a great 
way to help you understand where you are in a list. 
• Use Sound Effects helps you navigate by adding little clicks and 
chirps as you scroll, tap, and so on. 
• Speech is where you choose a voice for VoiceOver’s speaking. If 
you have a recent iPad model (with at least 900 megabytes of free 
space), you can now install Alex, the very realistic male voice that’s 
been happily chatting away on the Mac for years.
• Braille. The iPad can accept input from a Bluetooth Braille keyboard—
but that’s not new. In iOS 8, you can type in Braille, too. 
Braille, of course, is the system that represents letters as combinations 
of dots on a six- or eight-cell grid. Blind people can read Braille by 
touching embossed paper with their fingers. But thanks to iOS 8, they 
can type in Braille, too. For many, that may be faster than trying to 
type on the onscreen keyboard and more accurate than dictation.
On this Settings screen, you specify, among other things, whether you 
want to use the six- or eight-dot system.
When you’re ready to type, you use the Rotor (shown on the next 
page) to choose Braille Screen Input, which is usually the last item 
on the list. If the iPad is flat on a table (“desktop mode”), then the six 
“keys” for typing Braille are arrayed in a loose, flattened V pattern.
If you’re holding the iPad, you grip it with your pinkies and thumbs, 
with the screen facing away from you (“Screen away” mode). 
• The Rotor is a brilliant solution to a thorny problem. If you’re blind, 
how are you supposed to control how VoiceOver reads to you? Do 
you have to keep burrowing into Settings to change the volume, 
speaking speed, punctuation verbosity, and so on?

Chapter 6
156
Not anymore. The Rotor is an imaginary dial. It appears when you 
twist two fingers on the screen as if you were turning an actual dial. 
And what are the options on this dial? That’s up to you. Tap Rotor to 
get a list of options: Characters, Words, Speech Rate, Volume, Punctu-
ation, Zoom, and so on.
Once you’ve dialed up a setting, you can get VoiceOver to move from 
one item to another by flicking a finger up or down. For example, if 
you’ve chosen Volume from the Rotor, you make the playback volume 
louder or quieter with each flick up or down. If you’ve chosen Zoom, 
then each flick adjusts the screen magnification. 
The Rotor is especially important if you’re using the Web. It lets you 
jump among Web page elements like pictures, headings, links, text 
boxes, and so on. Use the Rotor to choose, for example, images—then 
you can flick up and down from one picture to the next on that page. 
• Typing Style. iOS 8 offers new options when you’re trying to type. 
In Standard Typing, you drag your finger around the screen until 
VoiceOver speaks the key you want—and then simultaneously tap 
anywhere with a second finger to type the letter.
In Touch Typing, you can slide your finger around the keyboard until 
you hear the key you want; lift your finger to type that letter.
Now there’s Direct Touch Typing, which is a faster method intended 
for people who are more confident about typing. If you tap a letter, 
you type it instantly. If you hold the key down, VoiceOver speaks its 
name but doesn’t type it, just to make sure you know where you are.
• Phonetic Feedback refers to what VoiceOver says as you type or 
touch each keyboard letter. Character means that it says the let-
ter’s name. Phonetics refers to the pilot’s alphabet: “Alpha,” “Bravo,” 
“Charlie,” and so on.

Accessibility
157
• Typing Feedback governs how the iPad helps you figure out what 
you’re typing. It can speak the individual letters you’re striking, the 
words you’ve completed, or both. 
• Always Speak Notifications makes the iPad announce, with a spoken 
voice, when an alert or update message has appeared. (If you turn 
this off, then VoiceOver announces only incoming text messages.)
• Navigate Images. As VoiceOver reads to you what’s on a Web page, 
how do you want it to handle pictures? It can say nothing about 
them (Never), it can read their names (Always), or it can read their 
names and whatever hidden Descriptions savvy Web designers have 
attached to them for the benefit of blind visitors.
• Large Cursor. This option fattens up the borders of the VoiceOver 
“cursor” (the box around whatever is highlighted) so you can see it 
better.
VoiceOver and Braille input take practice and involve learning a lot of new 
techniques. If you need these features to use your iPad, then visit the more 
complete guide at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3598. 
Or spend a few minutes (or weeks) at applevis.com, a site dedicated to 
helping the blind use Apple gear.
Tip: VoiceOver is especially great at reading your iBooks out loud. 
Details are on page 313.
Zooming
Compared with a computer, an iPad’s screen is fairly small. Every now and 
then, you might need a little help reading small text or inspecting those 
tiny graphics. 
The Zoom command, delightfully overhauled in iOS 8, is just the ticket; it 
lets you magnify the screen whenever it’s convenient, up to 500 percent. 
Of course, at that point, the screen image is too big to fit the physical 
glass of the iPad, so you need a way to scroll around on your virtual jumbo 
screen. That’s where iOS 8’s clever new features come in.
To begin, turn on the master Zoom switch in SettingsÆGeneralÆ 
Accessibility. Nothing visible has happened yet.

Chapter 6
158
Now look at the Zoom Region control. If it’s set to Window Zoom, then 
zooming will produce a movable rectangular magnifying lens (below). If 
it’s set to Full Screen Zoom, then zooming magnifies the entire screen. 
(And that, as many Apple Genius Bar employees can tell you, freaks out a 
lot of people who don’t know what’s happened.)
All right; you’re ready to zoom. Next time you need to magnify things, do 
this:
• Start zooming by double-tapping the screen with three fingers. 
You’ve either opened up the magnifying lens or magnified the entire 
screen. The magnification is 200 percent of original size. (Another 
method: Triple-press the Home button, and then tap Zoom.)
Tip: You can move the rectangular lens around the screen by dragging 
the white oval handle on its lower edge.
• Pan around inside the lens (or pan the entire virtual giant screen) by 
dragging with three fingers.
• Zoom in more or less by double-tap/dragging with three fingers. It’s 
like double-tapping, except that you leave your fingers down on the 
second tap—and drag them upward to zoom in more (up to 500 per-
cent) or down to zoom out again.
Once again, you can lift two of your three fingers after the dragging 
has begun. That way it’s easier to see what you’re doing.

Accessibility
159
Tip: There’s also a Resize Lens command in the Zoom menu, described 
next.
• Open the Zoom menu by tapping the white handle on the magnify-
ing lens. Up pops a black menu of choices like Zoom Out (puts away 
the lens and stops zooming), Full Screen Zoom (magnifies the entire 
screen, hides the lens), Resize Lens (adds handles so you can change 
the lens’s shape), Choose Filter (lets you make the area inside the lens 
grayscale or inverted colors, to help people with poor vision), and 
Show Controller (the joystick described below). There’s also a slider 
that controls the degree of magnification, which is pretty handy.
That’s the big-picture description of Zoom. But back in SettingsÆGeneralÆ 
AccessibilityÆZoom, a few more new controls await:
• Follow Focus. When this option is turned on, the image inside the 
magnifying lens scrolls automatically when you’re entering text. Your 
point of typing is always centered.
• Zoom Keyboard. Do you want the onscreen keyboard to be magni-
fied, too? Most of the time, probably not.
• Show Controller. The controller is this weird little onscreen joystick:
You can drag it with your finger to move the magnifying lens, or the 
entire magnified screen, in any direction. (It grows when you’re touch-
ing it; the farther your finger moves from the center, the faster the 
scrolling.) It’s an alternative to having to drag the magnified screen 
with three fingers, which isn’t precise and also blocks your view.

Chapter 6
160
TIP: You can tap the center dot of the Controller to open the Zoom 
menu described above. Or double-tap the center dot to stop or 
start zooming. 
• Maximum Zoom Level. This slider controls just how magnified that 
lens, or screen, can get.
TIP: When VoiceOver is turned on, three-finger tapping has its own 
meaning—“jump to top of screen.” Originally, therefore, you couldn’t 
use Zoom while VoiceOver was on.
You can these days, but you have to add an extra finger or tap for 
VoiceOver gestures. For example, ordinarily, double-tapping with 
three fingers makes VoiceOver stop talking, but since that’s the 
“zoom in” gesture, you must now triple-tap with three fingers to 
mute VoiceOver.
And what about VoiceOver’s existing triple/three gesture, which 
turns the screen off? If Zoom is turned on, you must now triple-tap 
with four fingers to turn the screen off.
Invert Colors and Grayscale
By reversing the screen’s colors black for white, like a film negative, you 
create a higher-contrast effect that some people find is easier on the eyes 
(facing page, left). To try it out, go to SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibility and 
turn on Invert Colors. The other colors reverse, too—red for green and so 
on.
The Grayscale option, new in iOS 8, removes all color from the screen. 
Everything looks like a black-and-white photo. Once again, it’s designed to 
help people with poor vision.

Accessibility
161
Speech
Your iPad can read to you aloud: an email message, a Web page, a text 
message—anything. Your choices here go like this:
• Speak Selection puts a Speak command into the button bar that 
appears whenever you highlight text in any app. Tap that button to 
make the iPad read the selected text. 
• Speak Screen, new in iOS 8, simply reads everything on the screen, 
top to bottom, when you swipe down from the top of the screen with 
two fingers. Great for hearing an ebook page or email read to you.
• Speak Auto-Text. You know how the iPad suggests a word as you 
type? This option makes the iPad speak each suggestion. That effect 
has three benefits. First, of course, it helps blind people know what 
they’re typing. Second, you don’t have to take your eyes off the 
keyboard, which is great for speed and concentration. Third, if you’re 
zoomed in, you may not be able to see the suggested word appear 
under your typed text—but now you still know what the suggestion is.

How to De-Sparsify iOS 8’s Design
When Apple introduced the sparse, clean design of iOS 7 (which carries 
over into iOS 8), thousands blogged out in dismay. “It’s too lightweight! 
The fonts are too spindly! The background is too bright! There aren’t 
rectangles around buttons—we don’t know what’s a button and what’s 
not! The Control Center is transparent—we can’t read it! You moved our 
cheese—we hate this!”
Well, Apple may not agree with you about the super-lightweight design. 
But at least it has given you the options to “fix” it. You can make the type 
bigger and bolder, the colors heavier, the background dimmer. You can 
restore outlines around buttons. And so much more.

Accessibility
163
All of these options await in SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibility.
Larger Text
This option is the central control panel for iOS’s Dynamic Type feature. It’s 
a game-changer if you, a person with several decades of life experience, 
often find type on the screen too small. 
Using the slider, you can choose a larger type size for all text the iPad dis-
plays in apps like Mail, iBooks, Messages, and so on. This slider doesn’t 
affect all the world’s other apps—until their software companies update 
them to make them Dynamic Type–compatible. That day, when it comes, 
will be glorious. One slider to scale them all.
TIP: The switch at the top, Larger Accessibility Sizes, unlocks an even 
longer slider. That is, it makes it possible for you to make the text in 
all the Dynamic Type–compatible apps even larger.
Bold Text
In iOS 8, the system font, Helvetica Neue Light, is fairly light. Its strokes are 
very thin; in some sizes and lighting conditions, it can even be hard to read.
But if you turn on Bold Text (and then tap Continue in the confirmation 
box), your iPad restarts—and when it comes to, the fonts everywhere are 
slightly heavier: at the Home screen, in email, everywhere. And much eas-
ier to read with low light or aging eyesight.
It’s one of the most useful features in iOS 8—and something almost nobody 
knows about. 
Button Shapes
Among the criticisms of the new iOS design: You can’t tell what’s a button 
anymore! Everything is just words floating on the screen, without border 
rectangles to tell you what’s tappable!

Chapter 6
164
That’s not quite true; any text in blue type is a tappable button. But never 
mind that; if you want shapes around your buttons, you shall have them—
when you turn on this switch (below, right). 
Increase Contrast
There are three switches in here. Reduce Transparency adds opacity to 
screens like the Control Center and the Notification Center. Their back-
grounds are now solid, rather than slightly see-through, so that text on 
them is much easier to read. (You can see the before and after here.)
Darken Colors makes type in some spots a little darker and heavier. You 
notice it in the fonts for buttons, in the Calendar, and in Safari, for example. 
Finally, Reduce White Point tones down the whiteness of iOS 8’s screens, 
making them slightly dimmer and less harsh.
Reduce Motion
What kind of killjoy would want to turn off the subtle “parallax motion” of 
the Home screen background behind your icons, or the zooming-in anima-
tion when you open an app?
In any case, you can if you want, thanks to this button.

Accessibility
165
On/Off Labels
The Settings app teems with little tappable on/off switches, including this 
one. When something is turned on, the background of the switch is green; 
when it’s off, the background is white.
But if you’re having trouble remembering that distinction, turn on this 
option. Now the background of each switch sprouts visible symbols to 
help you remember that green means on (you see a | marking) and white 
means off.
Hearing Assistance
The next options in SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibility are all dedicated to 
helping people with hearing loss.
Hearing Aids
This settings panel lets you “pair” your iPad with a “Made for iPad” hear-
ing aid. These wireless hearing aids are designed to sound great and not 
drain the battery. 
Mono Audio
If you’re deaf in one ear, then listening to any music that’s a stereo mix can be 
frustrating; you might be missing half the orchestration or the vocals. When 
you turn on the Mono Audio option in SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibility, 
the iPad mixes everything down so that the left and right channels contain 
the same monaural playback. Now you can hear the entire mix in one ear.
Tip: This is also a great feature when you’re sharing an earbud with a 
friend, or when one of your earbuds is broken.
Balance Slider
The L/R slider lets you adjust the iPad’s stereo mix, in case one of your 
ears has better hearing than the other.

Chapter 6
166
Media (Subtitle Options)
These options govern Internet videos that you play in the iPad’s Videos 
app (primarily those from Apple’s own iTunes store.)
• Subtitles & Captioning. The iPad’s Videos app lets you tap the Å 
button to see a list of available subtitles and captions. Occasionally, 
a movie also comes with specially written Subtitles for the Deaf and 
Hard of Hearing (SDH). Tap Subtitles & CaptioningÆClosed Captions 
+SDH if you want that Å menu to list them whenever they’re 
available.
The Style option gives you control over the font, size, and background 
of those captions, complete with a preview. (Tap the ƒ button to view 
the preview, and the sample caption, at full-screen size.) The Custom 
option even lets you dream up your own font, size, and color for the 
type; a new color and opacity of the caption background; and so on. 
• Video Descriptions. This new option is for Internet movies that come, 
or may someday come, with a narration track that describes the 
action for the blind.
Guided Access (Kiosk Mode)
It’s amazing how quickly even tiny tots can master the iPad—and how eas-
ily they can muck things up with accidental taps.
Guided Access solves that problem rather tidily. It’s kiosk mode. That is, 
you can lock the tablet into one app; the victim cannot switch out of it. You 
can even specify which features of that app are permitted. Never again 
will you find your Home screen icons accidentally rearranged or text mes-
sages accidentally deleted.
Guided Access is also great for helping out people with motor-control dif-
ficulties—or teenagers with self-control difficulties.
To turn on Guided Access, open SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibilityÆGuided 
Access; turn the switch On. 
Now a Passcode Settings button appears. Here’s where you protect 
Guided Access so the little scamp can’t shut it off—at least not without 
a four-digit password (Set Guided Access Passcode) or your fingerprint 
(Touch ID, a new option in iOS 8).
You can also set a time limit for your kid’s Guided Access. Tap Time Limit 
to set up an alarm or a spoken warning when time is running out.

Finally, the moment of truth arrives: Your kid is screaming for your iPad. 
Open whatever app you’ll want to lock in place. Press the Home button 
three times fast. The Guided Access screen appears. At this point, you can 
proceed in any of three ways:
• Declare some features off limits. With your finger, draw a circle 
around each button, slider, and control you want to deactivate. The 
iPad converts your circle to a tidy rectangle; you can drag its corners 
to adjust its size, drag inside the rectangle to move it, or tap the — to 
remove it if you change your mind or want to start again.
Once you enter Guided Access mode, the controls you’ve enclosed 
appear darkened. They no longer respond—and your iPad borrower 
can’t get into trouble.
• Change settings. If you tap Hardware Buttons, you get additional 
controls. You can prevent your little urchin from pressing the Sleep/
Wake Button or the Volume Buttons when in Guided Access mode, or 
from getting a response when rotating or shaking the iPad (Motion) 
or opening the Keyboards. If you want to hand the iPad to your 
3-year-old in the back seat to watch baby videos, you’ll probably 
want to disable the touchscreen altogether (turn off Touch) and pre-
vent the picture from rotating when the iPad does (turn off Motion).

Chapter 6
168
Here, too, is the Time Limit Options button, new in iOS 8. Tap to view 
hours/minutes dials. At the end of this time, it’s no more fun for Ju-
nior.
• Begin kiosk mode. Tap Start.
Later, when you get the iPad back and you want to use it normally, triple-
press the Home button again; enter your four-digit password or offer your 
fingerprint. At this point, you can tap Options to change them, Resume to 
go back into kiosk mode, or End to return to the iPad as you know it.
Switch Control
Suppose your physical skills are limited to very simple gestures: puffing on 
an air pipe, pressing a foot switch, blinking an eye, or turning the head, for 
example. A hardware accessory called a switch lets you operate certain 
gadgets this way.
When you turn on Switch Control, the iPad warns you that things are 
about to get very different. Tap OK.
Now the iPad sequentially highlights one object on the screen after 
another; you’re supposed to puff, tap, or blink at the right moment to say, 
“Yes, this one.”
If you don’t have a physical switch apparatus, you can use one nature gave 
you: your head. The iPad’s camera can detect when you turn your head left 
or right and can trigger various functions accordingly.
If you’d like to try it out, open SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibilityÆSwitch 
Control. Tap SwitchesÆAdd New SwitchÆCameraÆLeft Head Movement.
On this screen, you choose what a left head-turn will mean to your iPad. 
The most obvious option is Select Item, which you could use in conjunc-
tion with the sequential highlighting of controls on the screen. But you can 
also make it mean “Press the Home button,” “Activate Siri,” “Adjust the 
volume,” and so on.
Once you’ve made your selection, repeat that business for Right Head 
Movement.
When you return to the Switch Control screen, turn on Switch Control. 
Now your iPad is watching you; whenever you turn your head left or right, 
it activates the control you set up. Pretty wild.

Accessibility
169
The controls here let you specify how fast the sequential highlighting pro-
ceeds, whether or not it pauses on the screen’s first item, how many times 
the highlighting cycles through each screenful, and so on.
To turn off Switch Control, tap the on/off switch again. Or, if you’re using 
some other app, triple-press the Home button to open the Accessibility 
shortcut panel. If you had the foresight to add Switch Control to its options 
(page 172), then one tap does the trick.
Switch Control is a broad (and specialized) feature. To read more about 
it, open the Accessibility chapter of Apple’s iPad User Guide: http://help.
apple.com/ipad/8/.
AssistiveTouch
If you can’t even hold the iPad, you might have trouble shaking it (a short-
cut for “Undo”); if you can’t move your fingers, just adjusting the volume 
might be a challenge.
This feature is Apple’s accessibility team at its most creative. When you 
turn AssistiveTouch on, you get a new, glowing white circle near a corner 
of the screen. 

Chapter 6
170
You can drag this magic white ball anywhere on the edges of the screen, 
though; it remains onscreen all the time.
When you tap it, the white ball expands into the special palette shown on 
the previous page. It’s offering six ways to trigger motions and gestures on 
the iPad screen without requiring hand or multiple-finger movement. All 
you have to be able to do is tap with a single finger—or even a stylus held 
in your teeth or foot:
• Siri. Touch here when you want to speak to Siri. If you do, in fact, have 
trouble manipulating the iPad, Siri is probably your best friend already. 
This option, as well as the “Hey, Siri” voice command, mean that you 
don’t even have to hold down the Home button to start her up.
• Notification Center, Control Center. As far as most people know, the 
only way to open the Notification Center is to swipe down the screen 
from the top; the only way to open the Control Center is to swipe up 
from the bottom. These buttons, however, give you another way—one 
that doesn’t require any hand movement. (Tap the same button again 
to close whichever center you opened.)
• Home. You can tap here instead of pressing the physical Home but-
ton. (That’s handy when your Home button gets sticky, too.)
• Device. Tap this button to open a palette of six functions that would 
otherwise require you to grasp the iPad or push its tiny physical but-
tons (previous page). There’s Rotate Screen (you can tap this instead 
of turning the iPad 90 degrees), Lock Screen (instead of pressing the 
Sleep switch), Volume Up and Volume Down (instead of pressing the 
volume keys), and Mute/Unmute (instead of flipping the small Mute 
switch on the side, on iPads that have one).
If you tap More, you get some bonus buttons. They include Shake 
(does the same as shaking the iPad to undo typing), Screenshot (as 
though you’d pressed the Sleep and Home buttons together), Multi-
tasking (brings up the app switcher, as though you’d double-pressed 
the Home button), and Gestures. 
That Gestures button opens up a peculiar palette that depicts a hand 
holding up two, three, four, or five fingers. When you tap, for example, 
the three-finger icon, you get three blue circles on the screen. They 
move together. Drag one of them (with a stylus, for example), and 
the iPad thinks you’re dragging three fingers on its surface. Using this 
technique, you can operate apps that require multiple fingers drag-
ging on the screen.

Accessibility
171
• Favorites. Impressively enough, you can actually define your own 
gestures. On the AssistiveTouch screen, tap Create New Gesture to 
draw your own gesture right on the screen, using one, two, three, four, 
or five fingers. 
For example, suppose you’re frustrated in Maps because you can’t do 
the two-finger double-tap that means “zoom out.” On the Create New 
Gesture screen, get somebody to do the two-finger double-tap for 
you. Tap Save and give the gesture a name—say, “2 double tap.”
From now on, “2 double tap” shows up on the Favorites screen, ready 
to trigger with a single tap by a single finger or stylus.
Tip: Apple starts you off with one predefined gesture in Favorites: pinch. 
That’s the two-finger pinch or spread gesture you use to zoom in 
and out of photos, maps, Web pages, PDF documents, and so on. 
And now you can trigger it with only one finger; just drag either one 
of the two handles to stretch them apart. Drag the connecting line 
to move the point of stretchiness.

Chapter 6

Home-Click Speed
If you have motor-control problems of any kind (sleep deprivation and 
overdoing it at the bachelor party come to mind), you might welcome 
this enhancement. It’s an option to widen the time window for registering 
a double-press or triple-press of the Home button. If you choose Slow or 
Slowest, the iPad accepts double- and triple-presses spaced far and far-
ther apart, rather than interpreting them as individual presses a few sec-
onds apart.
Accessibility Shortcut
Burrowing all the way into the SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibility screen is 
quite a slog when all you want to do is flip some feature on or off. Therefore, 
you get this handy shortcut: a fast triple-press of the Home button.
That action produces a little menu, in whatever app you’re using, with on/
off switches for the iPad’s various accessibility features.
It’s up to you, however, to indicate which ones you want on that menu. 
That’s why you’re on this screen—to turn on the features you want to 
appear on the triple-press menu. Your options are VoiceOver, Invert 
Colors, Grayscale, Zoom, Switch Control, and AssistiveTouch.
TIP: If you choose only one item here, then triple-pressing the Home 
button won’t produce the menu of choices. It will just turn that one 
feature on or off.

O
f all the iPad’s talents, its iPoddishness may be the most suc-
cessful. This function, after all, gets the most impressive bat-
tery life. There’s enough room on your iPad to store thousands 
of songs. And iTunes Radio means that you’ll never run out of music to 
listen to—and you’ll never have to pay a penny for it.
To enter iPod Land, open the Music app. On a new iPad, it’s at the 
lower-right corner of the screen. 
Tip: There’s another way to get to iPod mode. Just swipe upward from 
the bottom of the screen. That opens the Control Center, whose 
central feature is the music playback controls and a volume control.
The Music program begins with lists—lots of lists. The icons at the bottom 
of the screen represent your starter lists: Radio, Playlists, Artists, Songs, 
Albums, Genres, Compilations, and Composers. Here’s what they all do.
iTunes Radio
Your iPad includes an amazing gift: your own radio station. Your own 
empire of radio stations, in fact. 
The iTunes Radio service lets you listen to exactly the kind of music you 
want to hear. It doesn’t just distinguish among genres like jazz or rock—
your choices are more like “upbeat male vocals with driving brass section” 
versus “slow lovesick ballads with lots of strings.”
You don’t get to choose the exact songs or singers you hear; you have 
to trust iTunes Radio to choose songs based on a song, singer, or music 
genre that you specify as a “seed.” For example, if you choose Billy Joel as 
your “seed,” you’ll hear a lot of Billy Joel, but also a lot of other music that 
sounds more or less like his.
Music

Chapter 7
174
Here’s something you can’t do when you listen to real radio: skip past a 
song you don’t like. When you tap the 4 button, iTunes Radio instantly 
skips to the next song it would have played. In fact, you can even tell it Play 
More Like This or Never Play This Song to shape your radio station’s future.
In exchange for all this magic, you have to listen to the occasional ad 
between songs. Unless you subscribe to iTunes Match (page 443), that 
is, in which case you never hear any ads.
The idea of a “seed song”–based radio service isn’t new, of course. It’s the 
same idea as Pandora, a Web site and app that has offered precisely the 
same features for years. But iTunes Radio is built in, it’s incorporated with 
Siri and the Control Center, and it’s so nice to use. It’s also part of Apple’s 
larger ecosystem; that is, you can see your same set of “radio stations” on 
your Mac or PC (in the iTunes app), iPhone, and Apple TV. 
Playing iTunes Radio
The first time you open the Music app, you see a Welcome screen. Tap 
Start Listening to arrive at the main iTunes Radio app. (You may be asked 
to enter your Apple ID and password. And if you’re not in a WiFi hotspot, 
the app either lets you know—or offers to use a cellular connection, if you 
have that kind of iPad.)
Across the top, you get a horizontally scrolling set of “album covers.” They 
represent ready-made “radio stations” that Apple has supplied for you. 
Tap the one called iTunes Top 50: Pop, for example, and your iPad instantly 
begins playing the biggest current pop hits. 
Below these, you see similar “album covers” for stations you’ve created 
yourself, as described below. Don’t forget to scroll down to see them all.
The Now Playing Screen
As a station plays, you see a screen like the one shown on page 178. It dis-
plays the cover picture for the song’s album, the name of the song, the 
band, and the album name.
Here’s what the controls do:
• 	”. Returns to the Start screen, where you can choose a different radio 
station.
• 	*. Opens the Info panel, described below.
• 	Price. Of course, Apple would be thrilled if you came across a song 
you liked so much you wanted to buy it. That’s why the price but-
ton ($1.29, for example) is so prominent. When you tap it, the price 
changes to say Buy Song; tap again to download the song directly to 

Music
175
your iPad. Now you can listen to it again, on command, without being 
subject to the randomness of iTunes Radio.
• 	Progress bar. You can’t fast-forward or rewind within a Radio song. 
This strip is just a graph that shows you where you are in the song. 
The numbers on either side show you how far you are into the song 
and how much is left to play.
• 	%. Tap to find the Play More Like This and Never Play This Song but-
tons, which let you fine-tune your “radio station,” tailoring it precisely 
to your tastes.
The third button, Add to iTunes Wish List, means, “I like this song; 
maybe I’ll buy it later.” When you get home to your Mac or PC, open 
the iTunes program, click Store at the top right, and then click My 
Wish List (in the list at right). Here’s the list you’ve been quietly build-
ing with your taps on the Add to iTunes Wish List button. You can 
listen to 1-minute previews, buy the complete songs, or delete them 
from the list if you’ve changed your mind.
Tip: You can also take a look at your Wish List right on the iPad. On the 
main Radio screen, tap History, then Wish List.

Chapter 7
176
• 3/2. Yeah, here’s another thing you can’t do with regular radio: pause.
• 4. This button doesn’t actually mean “fast-forward.” It means “skip.” 
You immediately hear the next song.
Note: You’re allowed to skip up to six songs per hour per station. When 
you reach that limit, the 4 is dimmed.
• 	Volume slider. Of course, you can also press the buttons on the right 
side of the iPad.
Tip: While the music is playing, you can switch off the iPad. The music 
keeps playing, with the screen off to save battery power. What’s 
cool is that if you tap the Sleep switch again, the Lock screen looks 
like the Now Playing screen. That is, it has 3/2, %, and 4 buttons, 
so you can manage the playback without even having to fully wake 
the iPad. 
Make Your Own Station
You can set up a new “radio station” of your own in either of two ways: by 
choosing one of Apple’s canned, ready-to-use stations or by typing in a 
song or performer you like.
• 	Prefab stations. On the Radio screen, tap New. Boom: There’s a huge 
list of music genres—Blues, Christian, Classical, Indie Rock, and so on. 
Tap one to see a list of prefab radio stations, ready to hear. 
If you tap Jazz, for example, the options include Bop, Early Jazz, Jazz 
Rock, Latin Jazz, and The Big Band Era. Tap a name to listen a little 
bit. If you like what you hear, tap the tiny ≠ button to its right. You’ve 
just added a new “radio station” to the iTunes Radio main screen.
• 	Type in a “seed.” Tap in the search box at the top; the keyboard 
appears. Type in—or tap the ß and speak—the name of a singer, band, 
song, or kind of music (show tunes or a cappella, for example).
On the results screen, tap the entry that looks most promising (“A 
Cappella Radio,” for example). You’ve just created a new station, and 
it begins instantly.
As your stations build up, they require more scrolling down the main iTunes 
Radio screen to find. But the New Station button (to create a new station) 
is always there, always at the very bottom.

Music
177
The Info Screen
If you tap the * button above the Now Playing screen, you’re offered 
some options that give you more control over whatever’s assaulting your 
ears:
• Ç. This button opens the full list of songs from the album you’re 
hearing right now. Each, of course, has a price button so that you can 
buy it. You can also read the album’s reviews (Reviews) and see what 
other albums its fans have bought (Related).
• 	Price. Tap to buy the song and download it to your iPad. 
• 	New Station from Artist, New Station from Song. If a song comes on 
that you especially like, these buttons instantly create a new station 
that will play more music that sounds like this performer or this song. 
In effect, you get to branch your original station into one that’s more 
finely tuned to a particular taste.

Chapter 7
178
• 	Tune This Station (available for stations you’ve created). Do you want 
iTunes Radio to feed you the most popular songs within the cate-
gory you’ve chosen? Or is it OK for it to play weirder, more obscure 
songs that you might not have heard before? Make your choice by 
adjusting this slider, from Hits (more mainstream) to Discovery (more 
out-there).
• 	Add to My Stations (available for Apple’s suggested stations). Turns 
the current, Apple-selected station into one of your own.
• 	Allow Explicit Tracks. Turn this switch on if you’re not easily offended 
by raunchy lyrics.
• 	Share Station. If you’ve created and fine-tuned a station so that it’s 
truly amazing, you can bestow your superior taste on your friends by 
sending them a link to your station. Tap this button to produce the 
standard Share sheet; you can send a station by AirDrop, text mes-
sage, email, Twitter or Facebook.
Tap outside the info panel to close it. 

Music
179
Deleting or Editing a Station
On the main Radio screen, in the My Stations row, tap Edit. Tap the name 
of the station you want to mangle or obliterate.
Now you can rename your station or share it. Using the Play More Like This 
and Never Play This sections, you can add performers, songs, or genres 
that you do or don’t want to be part of this station anymore.
Finally, if you scroll to the bottom, you can tap Delete Station to vaporize 
this ill-begotten station for good.
History
At the top of the main Radio screen, the History button opens a list of 
every song you’ve heard on each of your stations. It’s an amazing way to 
find out the name of some great song whose name you didn’t catch. 
This list also, of course, includes a Buy button for each of those songs.
Siri and iTunes Radio
One of the best ways to control iTunes Radio is by barking orders at it. 
Luckily, Siri comes equipped to recognize a whole slew of commands per-
taining to iTunes Radio.
Here’s a sampler; you don’t have to use these precise wordings.
• Play the radio.
• What song is this?
• Play more like this.
• Don’t play this song again.
• Pause the music; resume the music; skip this song.
• Play Billy Joel Radio or Play some Kelly Clarkson. (These must refer 
to stations you’ve already created.)
• Add this song to my Wish List.
• Stop the radio.

Playlists
A playlist is a group of songs you’ve placed together, in a sequence that 
makes sense to you. One might consist of party tunes; another might hold 
romantic dinnertime music; a third might be drum-heavy workout cuts. 
In the olden days, you could create playlists only in the iTunes software. 
(And you still can. After you sync the iPad with your computer, your play-
lists appear here.) These days, however, you can also create playlists right 
on the iPad; read on.
Creating Playlists on the iPad
In the Music app, tap Playlists; tap New Playlist (below, left). Type a name 
for your new playlist (below, bottom), and then tap Save.
Now tap one of the icons at the bottom—Songs, Artists, Albums, and so 
on—and you’ll find that every song has a å button (below, right). Tap that 
button, or tap directly on a song’s name, to add to the new playlist. Tap 
Done when you’ve added all the songs you want.

Music
181
You arrive at the details screen for this playlist (facing page), where you 
can inspect or edit your handiwork. Tap Edit to rearrange the play­list songs 
or to delete some. Or tap Playlists to back out to the list of play­lists, where 
your newly minted playlist is nestled.
Tip: The U icon means that you own this song, but it’s not currently 
on your iPad. You can still play it, but only when you’re connected 
to the Internet. Tap the U to download it to the iPad for offline 
playback, or tap Download All to download all the online songs.
Whatever playlists you create (or edit) on the iPad will wind up back on 
your computer, in iTunes, the next time you sync.
Using Playlists
To see what songs or videos are in a playlist, tap its name. (The ’ symbol 
in a Music menu always means “Tap to see what’s in this list.”) Or swipe 
rightward across its name.
Here you can use a standard iOS convention: Anywhere you’re asked to 
drill down from one list to another—from a playlist to the songs inside, for 
example—you can backtrack by swiping from the left edge of the iPad 
into the screen.
Or do it the long way: Tap ” at the upper-left corner of the screen (or 
swipe that word to the left). That button’s name always tells you what 
screen you just came from (Playlists, for example).
You now arrive at a Playlist details screen, where your tracks are listed for 
your inspection. To start playing a song in the Playlist list, tap it.
Tap Edit, if you like, to drag the songs into a new sequence or to delete 
some of them. Tap Clear if you want to choose a different set of songs 
within this play­list name, or tap Delete to get rid of the playlist altogether. 
(Tapping Shuffle starts them playing right now, in a random order.) 
Genius Playlists
Apple’s Genius playlist feature is supposed to analyze all your music and 
then, at the click of a button, create a playlist containing other songs from 
your library that “sound great” with one particular “seed” song. (Basically, 
it clumps songs by their degree of rockiness: soft-rock songs, harder rock, 
and so on.) 

Chapter 7
182
If you’ve used this feature in iTunes on your Mac or PC, and you’ve built up 
a Genius playlist or two, you’ll also find those playlists on your iPad. But 
you can make a Genius playlist right on the tablet.
Creating one of these playlists, however, involves submitting to Apple the 
contents of your music library, which creeps some people out. To con-
firm that you’re fine with that, you must begin in SettingsÆMusic, turn on 
Genius, and accept the legalese.
Then, back in the Music app, on any of its screens, tap the song you want 
to be the “seed”—the one you want the playlist to sound the most like. It 
starts to play.
Now tap Create at the top of the screen, and then tap Genius Playlist. 
Suddenly there’s a new playlist on your Playlists screen called Genius 
Playlist. It contains a bunch more songs that “go well” with your seed 
songs. You’re listening to your new Genius playlist.
Note: That is, if you have enough music on the iPad. If you don’t have a 
lot of music, you may get the “This song does not have enough 
related songs” error message. Tap OK and then try a different 
song. Or just spend $500 on music.
If you consider this batch worth saving, tap Save (top of the Genius Playlist 
screen). The new playlist now appears among your others on the Playlists 
screen, named after your seed song, bearing the ∏ logo to remind you 
that the iPad created that wicked mix. 
You can also tap Refresh to make the iPad take another stab at building a 
similar group of songs, or Delete to get rid of the playlist.
Next time you sync, this playlist will return to the mother ship: iTunes.
If you spot a song you can’t stand, swipe left across it and then tap Remove 
to delete it from the Genius playlist.
Tip: There’s another entity called a Genius mix. Unlike a Genius playlist, a 
mix is a never-ending “radio station.” You have to create it in iTunes 
on your computer and then sync it to your iPad. Once you do that, 
a new Genius button (∏) appears in the Music app on your iPad, 
providing access to your mixes.

Music
183
Artists, Songs…
The other icons across the bottom of the Music screen include these:
• Artists. This list identifies all the bands, orchestras, or singers in your 
collection. Even if you have only one song from a certain performer, 
it shows up here. Once again, you drill down to the list of individual 
songs by tapping an artist’s name. At that point, tap any song to 
begin playing it.
• Songs. Here’s an alphabetical list of every song on your iPad. Scroll or 
flick through it; use the index at the right side of the screen to jump 
to a letter of the alphabet; or scroll all the way to the top and type 
a song name, album name, podcast name, or band name into the 
search box. Tap anything to begin playing it.
Tip: At the bottom of any of these lists, you’ll see the total number of 
items in that list: “76 Songs,” for example. At the top of the screen, 
you may see the Now Playing button, which opens up the playback 
screen of whatever is playing.
Best of all, if you drag all the way downward on any list—Music, 
Podcasts, whatever—you’ll see that a search box has been hiding 
from you, up off the top of the screen. It lets you search your audio 
stash by name (title, band, or album).
• Albums. That’s right, it’s a list of all the CDs or downloaded albums 
from which your music collection is derived, complete with miniature 
pictures of the album art. Tap an album’s name to see a list of songs 
that came from it; tap a song to start playing it.
• Genres. Tap this item to sort your collection by musical genre: Pop, 
Rock, World, Gospel, or whatever. 
• Compilations. A compilation is one of those albums that’s been put 
together from many different performers. You know: “Zither Hits of 
the 1600s,” “Kazoo Classics,” and so on. You’re supposed to turn on 
the Compilation checkbox manually, in iTunes, to identify songs that 
belong together in this way. Once you’ve done that, all songs that 
belong to compilations you’ve created show up in this list.
• Composers. Here’s your whole music collection sorted by compos-
er—a crumb the iPad creators have thrown to classical-music fans.
Note: There used to be entries here for podcasts and iTunes U (lectures, 
lab reports, movies, and other educational materials supplied 
to the world by universities). They’re gone now, because Apple 
would prefer that you use its dedicated Podcasts and iTunes U 
apps.

Other Lists
If you’ve turned on Home Sharing (page 192), the icons at the bottom 
of the Music app—usually Radio, Playlists, Artists, Songs and so on—shift 
around. 
A More button appears here, replacing the Composers button. If you tap 
More, the More screen appears, listing two ways to view your collection: by 
Composers and by Shared. (Shared lists music that’s sitting on a computer 
elsewhere in your house, as described later in this chapter.)
Customizing List Land
But what if you’ve turned on Home Sharing, so your Composers button 
has moved into the More screen—but you like seeing your list of compos-
ers? Are you really expected to open up the More screen every time you 
want to see your list sorted that way? 
Nope. You can add Composers to the bottom of the main Music screen, 
replacing any of the starter categories (Radio, Playlists, Artists, Songs, and 
so on).
To renovate the starter icons, tap More and then Edit. You arrive at the 
“Drag the icons to organize tabs” screen.
Drag an icon from the top half of the screen downward, directly onto the 
existing icon you want to replace. It lights up to show the success of your 
drag. When you release your finger, the new icon has replaced the old one. 
Tap Done.
Oh, and while you’re on the Edit screen: You can take this opportunity to 
rearrange the seven icons at the bottom. Drag them around with your fin-
ger. Fun for the whole family!
Playback Control: Now Playing
Whenever a song is playing, the top left of the screen offers all the con-
trols you need to control music playback—some obvious and some not so 
obvious.
Tip: Here’s a non-obvious one: If the iPad is asleep, press the Home 
button (or tap the Sleep switch). Why, look—playback controls, right 
on the Lock screen! You don’t even have to wake or unlock the iPad.

Music

• Now Playing. Tap to see a huge version of the cover art, nearly filling 
the screen. Playback controls and song information are still available.
At the top-left corner of that screen, the ” means “Return to the list 
whence this song came.” It takes you back to the list of songs in this 
album, playlist, or whatever.
• Album list. At the top-right corner, the Ç icon seems to say “list.” 
Tap it to view a list of the other songs on this song’s album (next 
page), where you can jump directly to another cut by tapping its 
name.
Tip: You can double-tap the big album art picture to open the track list, 
too. It’s a bigger target.
• Album art. Most of the screen is filled with a bright, colorful shot of 
the original CD’s album art. (If none is available—if you’re listening 
to a song you wrote, for example—you see a big gray generic musi-
cal-note picture. You can drag or paste in an album-art graphic—one 
you found on the Web, for example—in iTunes.)
• Song info. Center top: the artist name, track name, and album name.
• Rating. If you tap the song’s name, it disappears. It’s replaced by a 
row of five light-gray dots.
This is your opportunity to rate the song, by tapping one of the five 
dots at the top edge of the screen. If you tap dot number three, for 
example, the first three dots all turn into stars. You’ve just given that 
song three stars. When you next sync your iPad with your computer, 
the ratings you’ve applied magically show up on the same songs in 
iTunes. (Tap the album cover to restore the song info and hide the 
rating.)
• Scrubber. This slider reveals two useful statistics: how much of the 
song you’ve heard, in minutes and seconds (at the left end) and how 
much time remains (at the right end).
To operate the slider, drag the tiny, vertical-line handle with your fin-
ger. You can jump to any spot in the song this way. (Tapping directly 
on the spot you want to hear doesn’t work.) 

Chapter 7
186
Tip: This is very cool: You can control the speed of the scrubbing, using 
this highly secret trick:
Drag the little handle upward or downward; the song title changes 
to show you the new scrubbing speed. As your finger slides farther 
from the handle, it says “Hi-Speed Scrubbing,” then “Half-Speed 
Scrubbing,” then “Quarter-Speed Scrubbing,” then “Fine Scrubbing.” 
The point is to get finer control over your scrubbing, making it 
easier to locate a specific spot in the tune.
• Play/Pause button. The Pause button beneath the album photo looks 
like this 3 when the music is playing. If you do pause, then the button 
turns into the Play button (2).

Music
187
Tip: If you’re wearing Apple earbuds, then pinching the microphone 
clicker serves the same purpose: It’s a Play/Pause control.
Incidentally, when you plug in headphones, the iPad’s built-in 
speaker turns off, but when you unplug the headphones, your music 
pauses instead of switching abruptly back to the speaker.
• Previous, Next (1, 4). These buttons work exactly as they do on an 
iPod: Tap 1 to skip to the beginning of this song (or, if you’re already 
at the beginning, to the previous song). Tap 4 for the next song.
Tip: If you’re wearing the earbuds, then you can pinch the clicker twice 
to skip to the next song.
If you hold down one of these buttons, you rewind or fast-forward. 
You hear the music speeding by, without turning the singer into a 
chipmunk. The rewinding or fast-forwarding accelerates if you keep 
holding the button down.
Tip: See the little scroll bar beneath the album art? You can also drag 
your finger across it to jump to any spot in the song.
• Volume. You can drag the round handle of this slider (bottom of the 
screen) to adjust the volume—or you can use the volume buttons on 
the right side of the iPad.
Tip: If you use your iPad for music a lot, don’t miss the Control Center, 
the panel that appears when you swipe up from the bottom of the 
screen. It includes playback controls, so you don’t have to go to the 
Music app just to change tracks.
• Repeat. If you really love a certain album or playlist, you can com-
mand the iPad to play it over and over again, beginning to end. Just 
tap the Repeat button.
Now you’re offered three looping options: Repeat Off (stop repeat-
ing), Repeat Song (loop this song endlessly), and Repeat All (repeat 
these songs over and over; it might instead say Repeat Album, Re-
peat Artist, or Repeat Playlist).
• Create. And voilà: Another pop-up list of options. There’s Genius 
Playlist (create a Genius playlist based on the song you’re listening 
to, as described on page 181;) New Station from Artist; and New 
Station from Song. These create new iTunes Radio “stations,” as 
described earlier in this chapter.

Chapter 7
188
• Shuffle. Ordinarily, the iPad plays the songs in an album sequen-
tially, from beginning to end. But if you love surprises, tap here so it 
changes to say Shuffle All. Now the album plays in random order.
By the way, there’s nothing to stop you from turning on Repeat and 
Shuffle, meaning that you’ll hear the songs on the album played endlessly, 
but never in the same order twice.
Multi(music)tasking
Once you’re playing music, it keeps right on playing, even if you press the 
Home button and move on to do some other work on the iPad. After all, 
the only thing more pleasurable than surfing the Web is surfing it with a 
Beach Boys soundtrack.
If you’ve got something else to do—like jogging, driving, or performing 
surgery—tap the Sleep/Wake switch to turn off the screen. The music 
keeps playing, but you’ll save battery power.
TIP: Even with the screen off, you can still adjust the music volume (use 
the volume buttons on the earbud clicker or the buttons on the side 
of the iPad), pause the music (pinch the earbud clicker once), or 
advance to the next song (pinch it twice).
Speakers and Headphones
The iPad’s speaker is pretty darned good for such a tiny machine. But 
the world is full of better speakers—black-and-white Bluetooth wireless 
speakers, car stereo systems, hi-fi TVs, and fancy headphones. The iPad is 
especially easy to use with them.
Bluetooth Wireless
You can buy amazingly small, powerful Bluetooth stereo speakers that 
receive your iPad’s music from as far as 20 or 30 feet away—made by 
Jawbone, Bose, and others. 
There are also Bluetooth headphones. But when you shop, make sure the 
headphones say “A2DP stereo”; the headsets for making office iPad calls 
and so on don’t play music over Bluetooth. 
Once you’ve bought your headphones or speakers, you have to introduce 
them to the iPad—a process called pairing.

Music
189
From the Home screen, tap SettingsÆBluetooth. Turn Bluetooth on 
(below, top); you see the Searching n animation as the iPad wirelessly 
hunts for your headphones or speakers.
Grab them, turn them on, and start the pairing procedure, as described 
in the manual. Usually that means holding down a certain button until a 
tiny light starts flashing. At that point, the headphones’ or speaker’s name 
appears on the iPad’s screen (below, bottom).
Tip: If the headphones or speakers require a one-time passcode—it’s 
usually 0000, but check the manual—then the iPad’s keyboard 
appears, so you can type it in.
A couple of seconds later, it says Connected; at this point, any sound 
that the iPad would ordinarily play through its speakers or earbuds now 
plays through the wireless ’phones or speakers. Not just music—which, in 
general, sounds amazing—but chirps, game sounds, and so on. Oh, and 
FaceTime calls.
If your headset has a microphone, too, you can even answer and make 
calls wirelessly. (There’s an Answer button right on the headphones.)
Using Bluetooth wireless stereo does eat up your battery charge faster. 
But come on: listening to your music without wires, with the iPad still in 
your bag? How cool is that?

Chapter 7

AirPlay
There’s another way to transmit audio wirelessly from the iPad (and video, 
too). Apple came up with a technology called AirPlay; you can buy AirPlay 
speakers, amplifiers, and TV sets. The Apple TV is the best-known AirPlay 
machine.
AirPlay is described on page 190, because most people use it to trans-
mit video, not just audio. But the steps for transmitting to an AirPlay audio 
gadget are the same.
Switching Among Speakers
When your iPad has a connection to a wireless sound source—a Bluetooth 
speaker or AirPlay receiver, for example—you need some way to direct the 
music playback to it.
The answer is the Ò button. It’s on the Control Center (previous page). 
When you tap it, the iPad offers a button for each speaker (lower right); to 
switch, tap the one you want.
Instantly, the sound begins flowing from your other sound source. Use the 
same method to switch back to the iPad’s speakers when the time comes.
Familiar iPod Features
The iPad has a long list of traditional iPod features for music playback. 
Most of these options await in SettingsÆMusic. (Shortcut: Tell Siri, “Open 
Music settings.”)
Sound Check
This feature smooths out the master volume levels of tracks from different 
albums, helping to compensate for differences in their recording levels. It 
doesn’t deprive you of peaks and valleys in the music volume, of course—it 
affects only the baseline level.
EQ (Equalization)
Like any good music player, the iPad offers an EQ function: a long list of 
presets, each of which affects your music differently by boosting or throt-
tling various frequencies. One might bring out the bass to goose up your 
hip-hop tunes; another might emphasize the midrange for clearer vocals; 
and so on. “Late Night” is especially handy; it lowers the bass so it thuds 
less. Your downstairs neighbors will love it.)

Music
191
Volume Limit
It’s now established fact: Listening to a lot of loud music through ear-
phones can damage your hearing. Pump it up today, pay for it tomorrow.
Portable music players can be sinister that way, because in noisy places 
like planes and city streets, people turn up the volume much louder than 
they would in a quiet place, and they don’t even realize how high they’ve 
cranked it. 
That’s why Apple created this volume slider. It lets you limit the maximum 
volume level of the music.
In fact, if you’re a parent, you can even lock down this control on your 
child’s iPad; it can be bypassed only with a password. Set the volume slider 
here, and then, in SettingsÆGeneralÆRestrictions, turn on Volume Limit, 
as described on page 191.
Group By Album Artist
Suppose you’ve bought a movie soundtrack album or compilation album 
with a different band on each track. 
In iTunes, you can see all these songs listed in a group, thanks to a text field 
called Album Artist. (There you see the unifying title—the movie name, for 
example.) 
When you turn on this option, the Music app consolidates all those artist 
names into a single new album-name entry in your Artists list. For exam-
ple, you’ll see an entry for “Apocalypse Now Soundtrack,” which you can 
tap to see the individual ’60s songs within it; the individual bands are no 
longer scattered alphabetically through the Artists list. 
Tip: Many soundtrack albums come with their Album Artist identified 
only as “Various Artists,” and that’s how your iPad will group them. 
In iTunes, however, you can select all the songs on the album, 
choose FileÆGet Info, and change the Album Artist to something 
more descriptive, like the movie title. When you sync the results 
back to your iPad, the album will show up in the proper spot in the 
Artists list.
Show All Music
Ordinarily, the Music app lists all your songs, whether they’re on your 
iPad or stored online, in your iTunes Store “locker.” (Any song you’ve ever 
bought on any Apple gadget is available to play or download at any time.) 

Chapter 7
192
Because, ordinarily, that’s what you’d want: the option to see all your 
music, no matter where it’s stored.
If you turn off Show All Music, the iPad lists only songs that are actually on 
it—not the online stuff. 
Genius
Here’s the master switch for permitting Genius playlists, as described 
above.
Playing Music from Your Computer
Here’s a trick you weren’t expecting: You can store many terabytes of 
music on your Mac or PC upstairs—and play it on your iPad in the kitchen 
downstairs.
This nifty bit of wireless magic is brought to you by Home Sharing, a fea-
ture of the iTunes program. To set it up, make sure your iPad and computer 
are on the same WiFi network. 
Then, in iTunes on the Mac or PC, open Preferences. Click Sharing, and 
turn on “Share my library on my local network.” (You can share only cer-
tain playlists, if you like.) Turn on Require password and enter your Apple 
account (iCloud) password. Click OK.
Now pick up your iPad. In SettingsÆMusic, log into Home Sharing using 
the same Apple ID and password. Finally, open the Music app on the iPad. 
Tap More, tap Shared, and tap the name of your computer’s iTunes library. 
(Later, when you want to return to listening to the stuff on the iPad itself, 
tap that same Shared button, but this time tap the name of your iPad.)
The iTunes Store
Just as you can buy apps using the App Store app, you can also browse, 
buy, and download songs, TV shows, and movies using the iTunes Store 
app. Anything you buy gets autosynced back to your computer’s copy 
of iTunes when you get home. Whenever you hear somebody mention a 
buy-worthy song, for example, you can have it within a minute. 
To begin, open the iTunes Store app. The store you see here is modeled on 
the App Store described in Chapter 9. This time, the buttons at the bottom 
of the screen include Music, Movies, TV Shows, Audiobooks, and so on.
When you tap one of those buttons, the screen offers further drilling-down 
buttons. For Music, for example, the scrolling horizontal rows of options 
might include New Releases, Recent Releases, Singles, and Pre-Orders.

Music
193
(Beneath each list is a Redeem button, which you can tap if you’ve been 
given an iTunes gift certificate or a promo code; a Send Gift button, which 
lets you buy a song or video for someone else; and an Apple ID button, 
which can show you your current credit balance.)
Tip: You can’t buy TV shows or movies on the cellular network—just in 
WiFi hotspots. That’s your cell company’s way of saying, “We don’t 
want you jamming up our precious cellular network with your hefty 
video downloads, bucko.”
Note, by the way, that you can rent movies from the store instead 
of buying them outright. You pay only $3, $4, or $5 to rent (instead 
of $10 to $16 to buy). But once you start watching, you have only 24 
hours to finish; after that, the movie deletes itself from your iPad. (If 
you like, you can sync it to your Mac or PC to continue watching in 
iTunes—still within 24 hours.)
To search for something in particular, tap Search (top right). The keyboard 
appears. Type what you’re looking for: the name of a song, movie, show, 
performer, or album, for example. At any time, you can stop typing and 
tap the name of a match to see its details. You can use the buttons across 
the top to restrict the search to one category (just songs or albums, for 
example).
All these tools eventually take you to the details page of an album, song, or 
movie. It closely resembles the details page of an app in the App Store—
you get an Info page, a page of customer ratings and reviews, and a 
Related tab that suggests similar masterpieces. 
For a song, tap its name to hear a 90-second preview (tap again to stop). 
For a TV show or movie, tap 2 to watch the ad or the sneak preview.
If you’re sold, tap the price button to buy the song, show, or album (and 
tap BUY to confirm). Enter your Apple ID password when you’re asked. 
(For movies, you can choose either Buy or Rent, priced accordingly.) At 
this point, your iPad downloads the music or video you bought. 
Purchased Items
Anything you buy from the iTunes Store winds up in the appropriate app 
on your iPad. Open the Videos app to see your TV shows and movies or 
the Music app to see your songs.
You can also inspect them from within the Music app; at the bottom, tap 
Purchased. 

Chapter 7
194
If you do that (and then tap the relevant category, like Music or Movies), 
you get a pair of tabs:
• All. Here’s a list of everything you’ve bought from iTunes, on your iPad 
or any other Apple machine.
• Not on This iPad. This is the cool part. Here you see not just the files 
on the iPad in your hand, but things you’ve bought on other Apple 
gadgets—an album you bought on your iPhone, for example, or a 
song you downloaded to your iPod Touch. (This assumes that you’re 
using the same Apple ID on all your gizmos.)
The beauty of this arrangement, of course, is that you can tap the 
name of something that’s Not on This iPad—and then download it. No 
extra charge.
Tip: If you prefer, you can direct your iPad to download those purchases 
that you make on other gadgets automatically, without your having 
to tap Not on This iPad. Visit SettingsÆiTunes & App Store, and turn 
on the switches for Music, Apps, and/or Books under Automatic 
Downloads. If you also turn on Use Cellular Data, then your cellular 
iPad will do this auto-downloading when you’re in any 3G or LTE 
cellular Internet area, not just in a WiFi hotspot.

Music
195
So you’ve downloaded one of the store’s millions of songs, podcasts, TV 
shows, music videos, ringtones, or movies directly to your iPad. Next time 
you sync, that song will swim upstream to your Mac or PC, where it will 
be safely backed up in iTunes. (And if you lost your connection before the 
iPad was finished downloading, your Mac or PC will finish the job automat-
ically. Cool.) 
The Videos App
The iPad has a separate app for playing TV shows, movies, and other vid-
eos. It’s called, of all things, Videos.
If you can’t figure out how to operate this app, then you shouldn’t be 
allowed to have an iPad. Its tabs are Movies, TV Shows, and Music Videos 
(or whatever video types you actually have). 
Note: If you’ve turned on Home Sharing (page 192), a tab appears 
here called Shared. It’s where you see your computers listed so 
that you can view the videos contained on them instead of on 
your iPad.
Tap to see the thumbnails of your videos; tap a video to see its plot sum-
mary, year of release, and so on. If it’s a TV series, tap an episode in that 
series, if necessary. Either way, tap 2 to begin watching.
Note: If you see a X icon on this screen, it means that this bought or 
rented movie is not actually on your iPad. If you have a good 
WiFi signal, you can watch it right now by streaming it (instead 
of downloading it to your iPad); tap the movie poster to open it, 
and then tap 2. Or download it to your iPad by tapping U.
If you don’t see that icon, then an Edit button appears instead. 
Tap it, and then tap the ° to delete it.
When you’re playing video, anything else on the screen is distracting, so 
Apple hides the video playback controls. Tap the screen once to make 
them appear and again to make them disappear.
Here’s what they do:
• Done. Tap this button, in the top-left corner, to stop playback and 
return to the master list of videos.
• Scroll slider. This progress indicator (top of the screen) is exactly like 
the one you see when you’re playing music. You see the elapsed time, 
the remaining time, and a white, round handle that you can drag to 
jump forward or back in the video.

Chapter 7
196
Tip: Drag your finger farther (up or down) from the handle to choose a 
faster or slower scrubbing speed.
• Zoom/Unzoom. In the top-right corner, a little { or } button 
appears if the video’s shape doesn’t exactly match your screen. Tap it 
to adjust the zoom level of the video, as described on page 198.
• Play/Pause (2/3). These buttons (and the earbud clicker) do the 
same thing to video as they do to music: alternate playing and 
pausing. 
• Previous, Next (0, 5). Hold down your finger to rewind or fast-
forward the video. The longer you hold, the faster the zipping. (When 
you fast-forward, you even get to hear the sped-up audio.)
If you’re watching a movie from the iTunes Store, you may be sur-
prised to discover that it comes with predefined chapter markers, just 
like a DVD. Internally, it’s divided up into scenes. To see them, stop 
playback (tap Done); on the movie page, tap Chapters. Tap a chap-
ter name to skip to that chapter marker—or tap 2 to return to your 
original spot.
Tip: If you’re wearing the earbuds, you can pinch the clicker twice to skip 
to the next chapter, or three times to go back a chapter.

Music
197
• Volume. You can drag the round handle of this slider (bottom of the 
screen) to adjust the volume—or you can use the volume buttons on 
the right side of the iPad.
• Language (Å). You don’t see this button often. But when you do, it 
summons subtitle and alternate-language soundtrack options, just like 
a DVD player.
• AirPlay (Ò). This symbol appears if you have an Apple TV (or 
another AirPlay-compatible electronic). Tap it to send your video 
playback to the TV, as described on page 199.
• Movie, Special Features, Related. These days, some movies come 
with what would once have been called DVD Extras: featurettes, alter-
nate endings, “making of” documentaries, and the like. If your iTunes 
Store movie came with these extras, the Special Features button 
offers them to you. (Movie takes you back to the movie.) And Related 
shows you other movies that Apple thinks you might like because 
they’re similar to this movie.
Tip: To delete a video, swipe leftward across its name in the Videos list; 
tap Delete to confirm. (You can always re-download it, of course.)

Chapter 7
198
Zoom/Unzoom
The iPad’s screen is bright, vibrant, and stunningly sharp. Sometimes, how-
ever, it’s not the right shape for videos.
Pre-HDTV shows are squarish, not rectangular. So when you watch older 
TV shows on a rectangular screen, you get black letterbox columns on 
either side of the picture. 
Movies have the opposite problem. They’re usually too wide for the iPad 
screen. So when you watch movies, you may wind up with horizontal let-
terbox bars above and below the picture.
Some people are fine with that. After all, HDTVs have the same problem. 
At least when letterbox bars are onscreen, you know you’re seeing the 
complete composition of the scene the director intended.
Other people can’t stand letterboxing. You’re already watching on a pretty 
small screen; why sacrifice some of that precious area to black bars?
Fortunately, the iPad gives you a choice. If you double-tap the video as it 
plays, you zoom in, magnifying the image so it fills the entire screen. Or, if 
the playback controls are visible, you can also tap ∏ or }.
Of course, now you’re not seeing the entire original composition. You lose 
the top and bottom of old TV scenes, or the left and right edges of movie 
scenes. 

Music
199
Fortunately, if this effect chops off something important—some text, for 
example—the original letterbox view is just another double-tap away. 
(Of course, no zooming happens if the source material is already a perfect 
fit for the iPad’s screen shape.)
TV Output
When you crave a bigger screen, you can play your iPad’s videos on a reg-
ular TV. All you need is the right cable: the Apple Digital AV Adapter. It car-
ries both audio and video over a single cable (an HDMI cable).
It mirrors what’s on the iPad: your Home screen, email, Safari, and every-
thing else. (Photos and presentations appear on your TV in pure, “video 
outputted” form, without any controls or other window clutter.)
AirPlay
Your iPad also offers wireless projection, thanks to a feature called AirPlay. 
It transmits music or hi-def video (with audio) from your iPad to an Apple 
TV (or another AirPlay-equipped receiver) across the room. It’s a fantas-
tic way to send slideshows, movies, presentations, games, FaceTime calls, 
and Web sites to your TV for a larger audience to enjoy. Whatever’s on the 
screen gets transmitted. 
AirPlay receivers include the Apple TV (version 2 or later), plus speakers, 
stereos, and audio receivers from Denon, Marantz, JBL, iHome, and other 
companies. 
The iPad and the AirPlay receiver must be on the same WiFi network. 
Then, when you’re playing a video or music, open the Control Center 
(page 37), and tap Ò to see a list of available AirPlay receivers, as illus-
trated on the next page. If you have an Apple TV, tap its name, then turn 
its Mirroring switch On. 
That’s it! Everything on the iPad screen now appears on the TV or sound 
system. (The iPad’s status bar displays the Ò icon, so you don’t wander 
off and forget that every move you make is visible to the entire crowd in 
the living room.) 

Chapter 7
200
Tip: You can even turn a Mac into an AirPlay receiver. A $13 program 
called Reflector (reflectorapp.com) lets you view the iPad’s live 
image on the Mac’s screen—and hear its sound. There’s also a 
Record command, so you can create a movie of whatever you’re 
doing on the iPad.
Reflector is great for trainers, teachers, or product demonstrators. 
And if you have a projector connected to the Mac, it’s a fantastic 
way to project your iPad onto a screen that’s even bigger yet.
Oh—and if you have a Mac running OS X Yosemite or later, a free 
trick awaits. Connect the iPad to the Mac with its white USB cable. 
Open QuickTime Player. Choose FileÆNew Movie Recording. From 
the little ‘ menu next to the ® button, choose your iPad’s name. 
Now you’re seeing the iPad’s screen on your Mac—and you can 
record it, project it, or screen-capture it for future generations! 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
201

I
t’s natural and easy and joyful to take pictures with your phone. But 
an iPad is a big honker. Holding it up blocks your view of your sub-
ject—and, often, the view of anyone behind you. Plenty of people 
heap ridicule on anyone who takes pictures with a tablet, or at least point 
and snicker at them.
But Apple pretends not to notice. With each new version of the iPad, 
Apple keeps making the tablet’s camera better. There’s no optical zoom; 
there’s no flash; and the iPad’s camera isn’t as good as the iPhone’s. But 
the photos can look every bit as good as what you’d get from a pocket 
camera. And the hi-def videos are indistinguishable from what you’d get 
out of a camcorder.
This chapter is all about the iPad’s ability to display photos, take new ones 
with its camera, and capture videos.
The Camera App
The little hole on the back of the iPad, in the upper-left corner, is its camera.
On the latest iPads, it’s pretty impressive, at least for a tablet cam. The iPad 
Air 2, for example, has manual exposure control, can shoot 10 shots a sec-
ond, and does amazingly well in low light.
The earlier iPad models’ cameras aren’t quite as good, but they’re still fine 
as long as your subject is still and well lit. Action shots may come out 
blurry, and dim-light shots may come out grainy.
Now that you know what you’re in for, here’s how it works.
Firing Up the Camera
Photographic opportunities are frequently fleeting; by the time you fish 
the iPad from your backpack, wake it up, slide your finger to unlock it, 
Taking Photos,

Videos

press the Home button, find the Camera app, and wait for it to load, the 
magic moment may be gone forever.
Fortunately, there’s a much quicker way to get to the Camera app when 
the iPad is asleep:
1.	 Press the Home button or Sleep switch to wake the iPad. 
A faint s button appears at the lower-right corner of the screen.
2.	 Flick the s button upward.
The Camera app opens directly. This trick shaves an unbelievable 
amount of time off the old get-to-the-camera method.
Tip: This Camera shortcut bypasses the “enter password” screen (if 
you’ve put a password or fingerprint restriction on your iPad). Any 
random stranger who picks up your iPad can jump directly into 
picture-taking mode.
That stranger can’t do much damage, though. She can take new 
photos, or delete the new photos taken during her session—but 
the photos you’ve already taken are off limits, and the features 
that could damage your reputation (editing, emailing, and posting 
photos) are unavailable in the Camera app. You have to open the 
Photos app to get to those—and that requires the iPad password.
The first time you use the camera, you may be asked if it’s OK to geotag 
your shots (record where you were when you took them). Unless you’re a 
burglar or are having an affair, tap OK.
Tip: Of course, there’s a hands-free way to fire up the Camera app, too: 
Tell Siri, “Open camera.”
The Six Modes of Camera
The Camera app in iOS 8 has been thoroughly made over. By swiping your 
finger vertically, you switch among its modes. (They’re listed on the right, 
but you can swipe anywhere on the screen.) 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
203
From top to bottom, these are the modes:
• Time-Lapse. This mode, new in iOS 8, speeds up your video, yet 
somehow keeps it stable. You can reduce a 2-hour bike ride into 20 
seconds of superfast playback.
• Slo-Mo (iPad Air 2). Wow, what gorgeousness! You get a video filmed 
at 120 frames a second—so it plays back at one-quarter the speed, 
incredibly smoothly. Fantastic for sports, tender smiles, and cannon-
balls into the pool.
• Video. Here’s your basic camcorder mode.
• Photo. This is the primary mode for taking pictures.
• Square. You might wonder why Apple would go to the trouble of 
designating a whole special camera mode to taking square, not rect-
angular, pictures. Answer: Instagram, the crazy-popular app that takes 
square pictures and was sold to Facebook for $1 billion.
• Pano. Choose this mode to capture super-wide-angle panoramic 
photos.
All of these modes are described in this chapter, but in a more logical 
order: still photos first, then video modes.

Chapter 8
204
Photo Mode
Most people, most of the time, use the Camera app to take still photos.
It’s a pretty great experience. The iPad’s screen is a huge digital-camera 
viewfinder. You can turn it 90 degrees for a wider or taller shot, if you like.
Tap the Exposure Point
All right: You’ve opened the Camera app, and the mode is set to Photo. 
See the yellow box that appears briefly on the screen? 
It’s telling you where the iPad will focus, the area it examines to calculate 
the overall brightness of the photo (exposure), and the portion that will 
determine the overall white balance of the scene (that is, the color cast).
If you’re taking a picture of people, the iPad’s software tries to lock in on 
a face—up to 10 faces, actually—and calculate focus and exposure so that 
they look right.
Tap the sky to make it correctly exposed,
even if the beach is now too dark.
Tap the dark beach to brighten it up,
although that also brightens up the sky.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
205
But sometimes, there are no faces—and dead center may not be the best 
place for the iPad to determine the exposure. The cool thing is that you 
can tap somewhere else in the scene to move that white square—to recal-
culate the exposure and white balance.
Here’s when you might want to do this tapping:
• When the whole image looks too dark or too bright. If you tap a 
dark part of the scene, the whole photo brightens up; if you tap a 
bright part, the whole photo darkens a bit. You’re telling the camera, 
“Redo your calculations so this part has the best exposure; I don’t 
really care if the rest of the picture gets brighter or darker.” At that 
point, you can override the iPad’s exposure decision, as described 
below.
• When the scene has a color cast. If the photo looks, for example, a 
little bluish or yellowish, tap a different spot in the scene—the one you 
care most about. The iPad recomputes its assessment of the white 
balance.
• When you’re in macro mode. If the foreground object is very close to 
the lens—4 to 8 inches away—the iPad automatically goes into macro 
(super closeup) mode. In this mode, you can do something really cool: 
You can defocus the background. The background goes soft, slightly 
blurry, just like the professional photos you see in magazines. Just 
make sure you tap the foreground object.

Chapter 8
206
Adjust Exposure
New in iOS 8: exposure control!
When you tap the screen to set the exposure point, a new control appears: 
a little yellow sun slider. That’s your exposure control. Slide it up to brighten 
the whole photo, down to make things darker—a first on the iPad’s built-in 
camera software.
Often, just a small adjustment is all it takes to add a little splash of light 
to a dim scene, or to dial the details back into a photo that’s bright white.
To reset the slider to the iPad’s original proposed setting, tap the screen 
somewhere else, or just aim the iPad at something different for a second.
The point is that the Camera app now lets you fuss with the focus point 
and the exposure level independently for the first time.
Focus Lock/Exposure Lock
The iPad likes to focus and calculate the exposure before it shoots. Yeah—
cameras are funny that way.
That tendency, however, can get in your way when you’re shooting some-
thing that moves fast. Horse races, divers. Pets. Kids on merry-go-rounds, 
kids on slides, kids in your house. By the time the camera has calculated 
the focus and exposure, which takes about a second, you’ve lost the shot.
Therefore, Apple provides an advanced feature that’s common on profes-
sional cameras but rare on tablets: Auto-Exposure Lock and Autofocus 
Lock. They let you set up the focus and exposure in advance so that there’s 
zero lag when you finally snap the shot.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
207
To use this feature, point the camera at something that has the same dis-
tance and lighting as the subject-to-be. For example, focus at the base of 
the merry-go-round that’s directly below where your daughter’s horse will 
be. Or point at the bottom of the water slide before your son is ready to go.
Now hold down your finger on that spot on the iPad’s screen until you see 
the yellow square blink twice. When you lift your finger, the phrase “AE/AF 
Lock” appears to tell you that you’ve now locked in exposure and autofo-
cus. (You can tap again to unlock it if you change your mind.)
At this point, you can drag the yellow sun slider to adjust that locked expo-
sure, if you like.
Now you can snap photos, rapid-fire, without ever having to wait while 
your iPad rethinks focus and exposure. 
Zooming In
The iPad has a zoom, which can help bring you “closer” to the subject—but 
it’s a digital zoom. It doesn’t work like a real camera’s optical zoom, which 
actually moves lenses to blow up the scene. Instead, it basically just blows 
up the image, making everything bigger, and slightly degrading the pic-
ture quality in the process.

Chapter 8
208
To zoom in like this, spread two fingers on the screen. As you spread, a 
zoom slider appears; you can also drag the handle in the slider, or tap + or 
-, for more precise zooming.
Sometimes, getting closer to the action is worth the subtle image-quality 
sacrifice.
The “Rule of Thirds” Grid
The Rule of Thirds, long held as gospel by painters and photographers, 
suggests that you imagine a tic-tac-toe grid superimposed on your frame. 
Then, as you frame the shot, you should position the important parts of 
the photo on those lines or, better yet, at their intersections.
According to the Rule of Thirds, this setup creates a stronger composition 
than putting everything in dead center, which is most people’s instinct.
Now, it’s really a Guideline of Thirds, or a Consideration of Thirds; plenty of 
photographs are, in fact, strongest when the subject is centered. 
But if you want to know where those magic intersections are so that 
you can at least consider the Rule of Thirds, you have to duck into the 
SettingsÆPhotos & Camera screen to turn it on. Scroll down; turn on Grid. 
From now on, the iPad displays the tic-tac-toe grid on your viewfinder, for 
your composition pleasure. (It’s not part of the photo.) You turn it off the 
same way.

209
High Dynamic Range (HDR)
Cameras have come a long way, but in one regard, they’re still pathetic: 
Compared with the human eye, they have terrible dynamic range.
That’s a reference to the scale of bright and dark spots in a single scene. If 
you see someone standing in front of a bright window, you can probably 
make out who it is. But in a photo, that person will be a solid black silhou-
ette. The camera doesn’t have enough dynamic range to handle both the 
bright background and the person standing in front of it.
Sure, you could adjust the exposure so that the person’s face is lit—but in 
the process, you’d brighten the background into a nuclear-white rectangle.
Until the world’s cameras are as sensitive as our eyes, we can make do with 
HDR (high dynamic range) photography. That’s when the camera takes 
three photos (or even more)—one each at dark, medium, and light expo-
sure settings. Then software combines the best parts of all three, bringing 
details to both the shadows and the highlights. 
Believe it or not, your iPad has a built-in HDR feature. It’s not as amazing 
as what an HDR guru can do in Photoshop—for one thing, you have zero 
control over how the images are combined, how many are combined, or 
how much of each is combined. And sometimes the HDR version of the 
photo looks worse than the original.
Tip: Should the iPad save a standard shot in addition to the HDR shot? 
That’s up to you. In SettingsÆPhotos & Camera, you’ll find the on/off 
switch for Keep Normal Photo.

Chapter 8
210
But often, an HDR photo does indeed show more detail in both bright 
and dark areas than a single shot would. In the iPad shot on the previous 
page, the sky is blown out—pure white. In the half at right, the HDR feature 
brings back the lost streaks of color. 
To use HDR, tap the HDR button at the top of the screen. It has three set-
tings: HDR On, HDR Off, and HDR Auto. The Auto setting, new in iOS 8, 
means “Use your judgment, iPad. If you think this is a scene with bright 
brights and dark darks, and would therefore benefit from your own HDR 
feature, please use HDR automatically.” Take your best shot.
When you inspect your photos later in the Photos app, you’ll know which 
ones were taken with HDR turned on; when you tap the photo, you’ll see 
the HDR logo at the upper-left corner. 
Taking the Shot
All right. You’ve opened the Camera app. You’ve set up the focus, expo-
sure, grid, HDR, and zoom. If, in fact, your subject hasn’t already left the 
scene, you can now take the picture.
You can do that in any of three ways:
• Tap the shutter (®) button. 
• 	Press either of the physical volume buttons on the right edge of the 
iPad.
Pressing a physical key feels more natural than, and doesn’t shake the 
camera as much as, tapping the onscreen ® button. Unfortunately, 
the volume keys are at the top left edge if you’re holding the iPad 
sideways (in landscape orientation).
• 	Press a volume button on your earbuds clicker (if you bought ear-
buds)—a great way to trigger the shutter without jiggling the iPad in 
the process, and a more convenient way to take “selfies.” 
Either way, if the iPad isn’t muted, you hear the snap! sound of a picture 
successfully taken. 
You get to admire your work for only about half a second—and then the 
photo slurps itself into the thumbnail icon at the lower-right corner of the 
screen. To review the photo you just took, tap that thumbnail icon. 
At this point, to look at other pictures you’ve taken, tap All Photos at the 
top of the screen. 
This is your opportunity to choose a photo (or many) for emailing, texting, 
posting to Facebook, and so on; tap Select, tap the photos you want, and 
then tap the Share button (P). See page 228.

211
Tip: For details on copying your iPad photos and videos back to your 
Mac or PC, see page 427.
Burst Mode (iPad Air 2)
Every iPad snaps photos over and over if you keep your finger pressed on 
the ® button or a volume key. 
But the iPad Air 2 takes them quickly—10 shots a second. That’s a fantas-
tic feature when you’re trying to study something that happens very fast: 
a golf swing, a pet trick, a toddler sitting still.
All you have to do is keep your finger pressed on the ® or the volume key. 
A counter rapidly increments, showing you how many shots you’ve fired.
Better yet, the iPad helps you clean up the mess afterward—the hassle 
of hand-inspecting all 230 photos you shot, trying to find the ones worth 
keeping.

Chapter 8
212
Tap the lower-right thumbnail to view your burst shot. To help keep you 
sane, the iPad depicts it as a single photo, with the phrase “Burst (72 pho-
tos)” (or whatever) in the corner of the screen. (In the Camera Roll, its 
thumbnail bears multiple frames, as though it’s a stack of slides.)
Here’s where it gets cool.
If you tap Select, you see all frames of the burst in a horizontally scrolling 
row. Underneath, you see an even smaller “filmstrip” of them—and a few of 
them are marked with dots.
These are the ones the iPad has decided are the keepers. It does that by 
studying the clarity or blur of each shot, examining how much one frame is 
different from those around it, and even skipping past shots where some-
body’s eyes are closed. Tap the marked thumbnails to see if you approve 
of the iPad’s selections.
Whether you do or not, you should work through the larger thumbnails in 
the burst, tapping each one you want to keep. (The small circle in the cor-
ner sprouts a blue checkmark.) 
When you tap Done, the iPad asks: “Would you like to keep the other 
photos in this burst?” Tap Keep Everything to preserve all the shots in the 
burst, so you can return later to extract a different set of frames; or Keep 
Only 2 Favorites (or whatever number you selected) to discard the ones 
you skipped.
Tip: In iOS 8, the front-facing camera can capture burst mode, too.
Self-Portraits (the Front Camera)
The iPad has a second camera, right there on the front, above the screen. 
The point, of course, is that you can use the screen itself as a viewfinder 
to frame yourself, experiment with your expression, and check your teeth.
To activate the front camera, open the Camera app and then tap the z. 
Suddenly, you see yourself on the screen. Frame the shot, and then tap the 
® button to take the photo.
Now, don’t get your expectations too high. The front camera is not the 
back camera. It’s much lower resolution. But when your goal is a well-
framed self-portrait that you’ll use on the screen—in an email or on a Web 
page, for example, where high resolution isn’t very important—then having 
the front camera is better than not having it.
The Self Timer
A self-timer is an extremely useful camera feature. It’s essential when you 
want to be in the picture yourself; you can prop the iPad on something and 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
213
then run around to join the group photo. It’s also a great way to prevent 
camera shake (which produces blurry photos), because your finger won’t 
jostle the iPad in the process of pressing the shutter button.
As of iOS 8, you no longer have to download a self-timer app. Just tap 
the 7 icon, and then tap 3s (a 3-second countdown) or 10s (a 10-second 
countdown).
Now, when you tap ® or press the volume key, a huge countdown appears 
on the screen. After the countdown, the iPad takes the picture all by itself. 
(If the sound is on, you’ll hear the shutter noise.)
Correction: The iPad takes 10 pictures, in burst mode. The iPad logically 
assumes that if you’re using the self-timer, then you’re not there to help 
frame the shot and know when everybody’s eyes are open. So it takes 10 
shots in a row; you can weed through them later to find the best shot.
Tip: The self-timer is available for both the front and back cameras. In 
other words, it’s also handy for selfies.
Square Mode
No longer do you have to download a special app (*cough* Instagram 
*cough*) just to take perfectly square photos, the way all the cool kids do 
these days. Just swipe across the screen until you enter Square mode.

Chapter 8
214
In Square mode, the photos the Camera app takes are square instead of 
rectangular (4 × 3 proportions). Otherwise, everything you’ve read in this 
chapter, and will read, is exactly the same in Square mode.
Pano Mode
Here’s one of the best camera features of the iPad: panoramic photographs. 
The iPad lets you capture a 240-degree, ultra-wide-angle, 30-megapixel 
photo by swinging the iPad around you in an arc. The iPad creates the 
panorama in real time (you don’t have to line up the sections yourself). 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
215
Next time you’re standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon—or anything 
else that requires a really wide or tall angle—keep this feature in mind. 
Once you’ve opened the Camera app, swipe upward until you reach Pano 
mode.
Tip: The big white arrow tells you which way to move the iPad. But you 
can reverse it (the direction) just by tapping it (the arrow) before 
you begin.
Tap ® (or press a volume key). Now, as instructed by the screen, swing the 
iPad around you—smoothly and slowly, please. You have to hold the iPad 
upright (portrait orientation) to swing around you horizontally. You can 
also turn it sideways to swing vertically (to capture something very tall).
As you go, the screen gives you three kinds of feedback:
• It says “Slow down” if you start swinging too fast. Truth is, as far as 
the iPad is concerned, the slower the better.
• It says “Move up” or “Move down” if you’re not keeping the iPad level. 
Use the big white arrow itself like a carpenter’s level; you’ll leave the 
center line if you’re not staying level as you move your arm.
• The preview of your finished panorama builds itself as you move. That 
is, you’re seeing the final product, in miniature, while you’re still taking 
it.
You’ll probably find that 240 degrees—the maximum—is a really wide 
angle. You’ll feel twisted at the waist like taffy. But in fact you can end the 
panorama at any stage, just by tapping the S button. 
When you do finally tap S, you’ll find that the iPad has taken a very wide, 
amazingly seamless photograph at very high resolution. If a panorama is 
too wide, you can crop it, as described later in this chapter. 
If you snap a real winner, you can print it out at a local graphics shop, 
frame it, and hang it above the entire length of your living-room couch.

Chapter 8
216
Video Mode
You can record video as well as still photos. It’s smooth (30 frames per 
second), sharp, colorful video that does surprisingly well in low light. It’s 
probably the best-looking video a tablet can take.
The video is the best flavor of high definition (1080p)—and it’s even sta-
bilized to prevent hand jerkiness, just like a real camcorder is. You can 
also use a gorgeous, 120-frames-per-second slow-motion mode that turns 
even frenzied action into graceful, liquidy visual ballet.
Using video is almost exactly like taking stills. Open the Camera app. 
Swipe up until you’ve selected Video mode. You can hold the iPad either 
vertically or horizontally, although most people on the Internet will spit on 
you for capturing tall-and-thin videos (because they don’t fit horizontal 
screens well, including YouTube, laptops, and TVs).
Tip: When you switch from still-photo mode to video, you may notice 
that the video image on the screen suddenly jumps bigger, as 
though it’s zooming in. And it’s true: The iPad is oddly more 
“zoomed in” in camcorder mode than in camera mode.
Tap to compute focus, exposure, and white balance, as described on the 
previous pages. (You can even hold your finger down to trigger the expo-
sure and focus locks, or drag the tiny yellow sun to adjust exposure man-
ually, as described earlier.)
Then tap Record (®)—or press a volume key on the edge of the iPad—and 
you’re rolling! As you film, a time counter ticks away at the top.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
217
Things to Do While You’re Rolling
Once you’ve begun capturing video, don’t think your work is done. You 
can have all kinds of fun during the recording. For example:
• Change focus. You can change focus while you’re filming, which is 
great when you’re panning from a nearby object to a distant one. 
Refocusing is automatic, just as it is on regular camcorders. But you 
can also force a refocusing (for example, when the iPad is focusing 
on the wrong thing) by tapping in your “viewfinder” to specify a new 
focus point. The iPad recalculates the focus, white balance, and expo-
sure at that point, just as it does when you’re taking stills.
• Zoom in. You can zoom in while you’re filming, up to 3x actual size. 
Just spread two fingers on the screen, like you would to magnify a 
photo. Pinch two fingers to zoom out again. 
Tip: Once you start to zoom, a zoom slider appears on the screen. It’s 
much easier to zoom smoothly by dragging its handle than it is to 
use a two-finger pinch or spread.
So here’s a smart idea: Zoom in slightly before you start recording, 
so that the zoom slider appears on the screen. Then, during the 
shot, drag its handle to zoom in, as smoothly as you like.
When you’re finished recording, tap S. The iPad stops recording and plays 
a chime; it’s ready to record another shot.
There’s no easier-to-use camcorder on earth. And, man, what a lot of 
capacity! Each individual shot can be an hour long—and on the 128-giga-
byte iPad, you can record 68 hours of video. Which ought to be just about 
long enough to capture the entire elementary-school talent show.
The Front Camera
You can film yourself, too. Just tap z before you film to make the iPad use 
its front-mounted camera. The resolution is lower than the back camera’s, 
but it’s still high definition. 
Slo-Mo Mode
If you have an iPad Air 2, you’re a lucky duck: Your Camera app has an 
additional mode called Slo-Mo. (Swipe down until Slo-Mo is selected.)
Capturing video in this mode is exactly like capturing video the regular 
way—but behind the scenes, the iPad is recording 120 frames a second 
instead of the usual 30. 

Chapter 8
218
When you open the captured movie to watch it, you’ll see something star-
tling and beautiful: The clip plays at full speed for 1 second, slows down 
to one-quarter or one-eighth speed, and, for the final second, accelerates 
back to full speed. It’s a great way to study sports action, cannonball dives, 
and shades of expression in a growing smile.
What you may not realize, however, is that you can adjust where the 
slow-motion effect begins and ends in the clip. When you open the video 
for playback, a strange kind of ruler track appears above it. Drag the verti-
cal handles inward or outward to change the spot where the slow motion 
begins and ends. (Use the thick white vertical bar in the “filmstrip” at top 
to scrub through the clip to see where you are.)
Time-Lapse Mode
Whereas Slo-Mo mode is great for slowing down fast scenes, the new 
Time-Lapse mode speeds up slow scenes: flowers growing, ice melting, 
candles burning, and so on.
Actually, this mode might better be called hyperlapse. Time-lapse implies 
that the camera is locked down while recording. But in a hyperlapse video, 
the camera is moving. This mode works great for bike rides, hikes, drives, 
plane trips, and so on; it compresses even multihour events down to under 
a minute of playback, with impressive smoothness.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
219
So how much does the Time-Lapse mode speed up the playback? Answer: 
It varies. The longer you shoot, the greater the speed-up. The app accel-
erates every recording enough to play back in 20 to 40 seconds, whether 
you film for 1 minute, 100 minutes, or 1,000 minutes.
If you film for less than 20 seconds, your video plays back at 15 times orig-
inal speed. But you can film for much, much longer, like 30 hours or more. 
Time-Lapse mode speeds up the result from 15x, 240x, 960x—whatever it 
takes to produce a 20- to 40-second playback.
Trimming a Video
To review whatever video you’ve just shot, tap the thumbnail icon at the 
lower-right corner of the screen. You’ve just opened up the video playback 
screen. Tap ÷ to play back the video.
What’s really cool, though, is that you can edit this video right on the iPad. 
You can trim off the dead air at the beginning and the end.
To do that, tap the screen to make the scroll bar appear at the top (if you 
don’t already see it). Then drag the q and Q markers (currently at the outer 
ends of the little filmstrip) inward so that they turn yellow. Adjust them, 
hitting ÷ to see the effect as you go. 

Chapter 8
220
Tip: You can drag the playback cursor—the vertical white bar that 
indicates your position in the clip—with your finger. That’s the 
closest thing you get to Rewind and Fast-Forward buttons. (In fact, 
you may have to move it out of the way before you can move the 
end handles for trimming.)
When you’ve positioned the handles so that they isolate the good stuff, 
tap Trim.
Finally, tap either Trim Original (meaning “shorten the original clip perma-
nently”) or Save as New Clip (meaning “leave the original untouched, and 
spin out the shortened version as a separate video”).
iMovie for iPad
Of course, there’s more to editing than just snipping dead air from the 
ends of a clip. That’s why Apple made iMovie for iPad. It’s free on a new 
iPad or $5 if it didn’t come with your iPad. 
The Photos App
Once you’ve taken some photos, or copied them to your iPad from your 
computer (see Chapter 14), you’ll have some pictures ready to view. 
Presenting them, sharing them, editing them, and slideshowing them is 
the job of the Photos app. 
TIP: The Photos app is fully rotational. That is, you can turn the iPad 90 
degrees. Whether you’re viewing a list, a screen full of thumbnails, or 
an individual photo, the image on the screen rotates, too, for easier 
admiring. (Unless, of course, you’ve turned on Lock Rotation.)
At the bottom of the Photos app screen, three tabs lie in wait: Photos, 
Shared, and Albums. The next few sections explain what they do.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
221
The Photos Tab
In the olden days, the Photos app displayed all your photos—thousands of 
them—in one endless, scrolling mass. If you were hunting for a particular 
shot, you had to study the thumbnails with an electron microscope.
Now, though, iOS groups them intelligently into sets that are easy to nav-
igate. Here they are, from smallest to largest:
• Moments. A moment is a group of photos you took in one place at 
one time—for example, all the shots at the picnic by the lake. The iPad 
even uses its own GPS to give each moment a name: “San Francisco, 
California (Union Square),” for example.
Tip: If you tap a Moment’s name, a map opens up; little photo thumbnails 
show exactly where these pictures were taken. Slick!

Chapter 8
222
• Collections. Put a bunch of moments together, and what do you get? 
A collection. Here again, the iPad tries to study the times and places 
of your photo taking—but this time, it puts them into groups that 
might span a few days and several locations. You might discover that 
your entire spring vacation is a single collection, for example.
• Years. If you “zoom out” of your photos far enough, you wind up 
viewing them by year: 2014, 2015, and so on.
To “zoom in” from larger groupings to smaller ones (YearsÆCollectionsÆ​
Moments), just tap each pile of thumbnails. If you tap a thumbnail on the 
Moments screen, you open that photo for viewing. 
Tip: When you first open a photo, it appears on a white background. Tap 
the photo to change the background to black, which often makes 
your photos’ colors look better.
To “zoom out” again, tap the grouping name at top left (Years, for example).
Tip: If you’ve opened a single photo for examination, you can retreat to 
the moment it came from by pinching with two fingers.
The last technique worth knowing is the Finger Browse. Whenever you’re 
looking at a tiny grid of tiny thumbnail images (in a Year or Collection), 
hold your finger down within the batch. A larger thumbnail sprouts from 
your finger, as on this sunset shot here— 
—and you can slide your finger around within the mosaic to find a partic-
ular photo, or a batch of them.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
223
The Albums Tab
(The second tab is actually the Shared tab, but we’re skipping over it for 
now; see page 250.)
The Albums tab, completely redefined in iOS 8, is a scrolling list of special-
ized photo “folders” like these:
• Camera Roll means “pictures you’ve taken with the iPad” (as opposed 
to “pictures you’ve imported from your computer”). If you see All 
Photos instead, it’s because you’ve turned on iCloud Photo Library 
(page 255).
• My Photo Stream holds the last 1,000 pictures you’ve taken or 
imported on any of your Apple gadgets; see page 246.
• Favorites. This folder gives you quick access to your favorite photos. 
And how does the iPad know? Easy: You’ve told it which photos are 
your favorites. You’ve tapped the 6 icon above a photo, anywhere 
within the Photos app. (Favorites must be photos you’ve taken with 
the iPad, not transferred from your computer.)
• Panoramas, Videos, Slo-Mo, Time-Lapse, Bursts. As a convenience 
to you, these categories give you one-tap shopping for everything 
you’ve captured using the Camera app’s specialized picture and video 

Chapter 8
224
modes. Super handy when you’re trying to show someone your latest 
time-lapse masterpiece, for example; you know where to look for it.
• Events means all the photos you’ve selected to copy from your Mac 
or PC. (You don’t see Events if you haven’t copied any over.)
• Faces. Both iPhoto and Aperture, Apple’s Mac photography pro-
grams, have features that let you identify, by name, the people whose 
faces are in your photos. Once you’ve given the software a running 
start, it can find those people in the rest of your photo collection 
automatically. That’s handy every now and then—when you need pho-
tos of your kid for a school project, for example.
Here you’ll find a list of everyone whose faces you identified on your 
Mac—and every picture of that person. (Again, Faces doesn’t appear 
if you don’t use that feature.)
• Albums. Here you get a list of albums—whatever you’ve copied to the 
iPad from your Mac or PC (if any).
• Recently Deleted. iOS 8 offers you a new safety net. Even after you 
think you’ve deleted a photo or video from your iPad, you have 30 
days to change your mind. Deleted pictures and videos sit in this 
folder, quietly counting down to their own doomsdays.
If you wind up changing your mind, you can open Recently Deleted, 
tap the photo you’d condemned, and tap Recover. It pops back into 
its rightful place in the Photos app, saved from termination.
On the other hand, you can also zap a photo into oblivion before its 
30-day countdown is up. Tap to open it, tap Delete, and then confirm 
with Delete Photo. If you tap Select, you can also hit Delete All or 
Recover All.
As you’d guess, you can drill down from any of these groupings to a screen 
full of thumbnails, and from there to an individual photo.
Tip: If you hold your finger down on the photo or even its thumbnail, a 
Copy button appears. That’s one way to prepare for pasting a single 
photo into an email message, an MMS (picture or video) message to 
a phone, and so on.

Hide a Photo
Here’s a quirky new iOS 8 feature: It’s now possible to hide a photo from 
the Photos tab (Moments, Collections, and Years), so that it appears only 
on the Albums tab (in your albums and in a special Hidden folder). 
Apple noticed that lots of people use their iPads to take screenshots of 
apps, pictures of whiteboards or diagrams, shots of package labels or 
parking-garage signs, and so on. These images aren’t scenic or lovely; 
they’re not really memories; they don’t look good (or serve much purpose) 
when they appear nestled in with your shots-to-remember in Moments, 
Collections, and Years. (Hidden photos don’t appear in slideshows, either.)
To hide a picture, hold your finger down (either on its thumbnail or its 
opened image). On the button bar, tap Hide. To confirm, tap Hide Photo.
Whatever photos you hide go to a new folder on the Albums tab—called, 
of course, Hidden, so that you can find them easily. From here, you can 
un-hide a shot by holding your finger down on it and tapping Unhide.
Flicking, Rotating, Zooming, Panning
Once a photo is open at full size, you have your chance to perform the four 
most famous and most dazzling tricks of the iPad: flicking, rotating, zoom-
ing, and panning a photo.
• Flicking right to left is how you advance to the next picture or movie 
in the batch. (Flick from left to right to view the previous photo.)
• Rotating is what you do when a horizontal photo or video appears on 
the upright iPad, which fills most of the screen with blackness.
Just turn the iPad 90 degrees in either direction. Like magic, the 
photo itself rotates and enlarges to fill its new, wider canvas. No taps 
required. (This doesn’t work when the iPad is flat on its back—on a ta-
ble, for example. It has to be more or less upright. It also doesn’t work 
when Portrait Orientation is locked.)
This trick also works the other way: You can make a vertical photo fit 
better by turning the iPad upright.
• Zooming a photo means magnifying it, and it’s a blast. One quick 
way is to double-tap the photo; the iPad zooms in on the portion you 
tapped, doubling its size.
Another technique is to use the two-finger spread, which gives you 
more control over what gets magnified and by how much. 

Chapter 8
226
Once you’ve spread a photo bigger, you can then pinch to scale it 
down again. Or just double-tap to restore the original size. (You don’t 
have to restore a photo to original size before advancing to the next 
one, though; if you flick enough times, you’ll pull the next photo onto 
the screen.)
• Panning means moving a photo around on the screen after you’ve 
zoomed in. Just drag your finger to do that; no scroll bars are 
necessary.
Tip: When the iPad is rotated, all the controls and gestures reorient 
themselves. For example, flicking right to left still brings on the next 
photo, even if you’re now holding the iPad the wide way.
Finding Photos
Yep, there’s now a search feature in the iOS 8 Photos app.
Which might seem odd. How can you search for a blob of pixels? How 
does the iPad know what’s in a picture?
It doesn’t. All you can search for is the data associated with a photo: time, 
place, album name. 
To try it out, tap the ¢ at the top of the Photos or Albums screens. Right 
off the bat, the iPad offers some one-tap canned searches based on loca-
tion (like Nearby and Home) and dates (like February 2015). Tap to see the 
photos that match.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
227
Or you can type in a place, date, name, or album. Try typing september, or 
tucson, or bay area, or 2014, for example. As you type, iOS 8 displays all 
the photo groupings that match what you’ve typed so far.
Tap that grouping to see the photo thumbnails within.
Deleting Photos
If some photo no longer meets your exacting standards, you can delete it. 
But this action is trickier than you may think.
• If you took the picture using the iPad, no sweat. Open the photo; 
tap T. When you tap Delete Photo, that picture is gone. Or, rather, it’s 
moved to the Recently Deleted folder described on page 224; you 
have 30 days to change your mind.
• If the photo was synced to the iPad from your computer, you can’t 
delete it right on the iPad. Instead, delete it from the original album on 
your computer (which does not mean deleting it from the computer 
altogether). The next time you sync the iPad, the photo disappears 
from it, too. 
Photo Controls
Once you’ve opened a photo, some useful controls appear. (Tap anywhere 
to hide them and summon a black background, for more impressive photo 
presentation.)

Chapter 8
228
• Album name. The name in the upper-left corner specifies which 
group this photo came from. Tap there to return to that batch.
• Date and time. The top of the screen says “September 13, 12:52 pm,” 
for example, letting you know when this photo was taken.
• Edit. This button is the gateway to the iPad’s photo-editing features, 
described in the following pages.
• Share icon. Tap P in the lower left if you want to do something more 
with this photo than just stare at it. You can use it as your iPad’s wall-
paper, print it, copy it, text it, send it by email, use it as some­body’s 
headshot in your Contacts list, post it on Twitter or Facebook, and so 
on. These options are all described later in this chapter. 
• Favorite icon. When you find a picture you really love—enough that 
you might want to call it up later to show people—tap the new 6 
button above it. This photo or video now appears in the Favorites 
folder (in the Albums tab of the Photos app, described earlier), so 
that it’s easy to find with your other prize-winners. (The 6 appears 
only on photos you’ve taken with the iPad—not pictures you’ve 
imported from computers or other cameras.)
Editing Photos
Yes, kids, it’s true: You can crop and edit your pictures right on the iPad. 
The tools Apple gives you aren’t exactly Photoshop, but they’ve been sub-
stantially beefed up in iOS 8.
To edit a photo, tap its thumbnail (anywhere in the Photos app) to open it. 
Tap Edit in the upper right.
Now you get four buttons, plus Cancel and Done. Their names aren’t 
shown, but their functions (from top) are Auto-Enhance, Crop/Straighten, 
Filters, Adjust Color, and (sometimes) More. Read on.
Note: All the changes described on these pages are nondestructive. 
That is, the Photos app never forgets the original photo. At any 
time, hours or years later, you can return to the Edit screen and 
undo the changes you’ve made (tap Revert). You can recrop the 
photo back to its original size, for example, or turn off the Auto-
Enhance button. In other words, your changes are never really 
permanent.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
229
Auto-Enhance (°)
When you tap this magical button, the iPad analyzes the relative bright-
ness of all the pixels in your photo and attempts to “balance” it. After a 
moment, the app adjusts the brightness and contrast and intensifies dull 
or grayish-looking areas. Usually, the pictures look richer and more vivid 
as a result.
You may find that Auto-Enhance has little effect on some photos, only 
minimally improves others, and totally rescues a few. In any case, if you 
don’t care for the result, you can tap the ° button again to turn Auto-
Enhance off.
Crop/Straighten (·)
In iOS 8, this button opens a crazy new editing screen. Here you adjust the 
size, shape, and angle of the photo.
When you tap ·, something magical happens: iOS 8 analyzes whatever 
horizontal lines it finds in the photo—the horizon, for example, or the roof 
line of a building—and uses it as a guide to straighten the photo automat-
ically. It’s very smart, as you can see in the example on the next page at 
top.
See how the photo has been tilted slightly—and enlarged slightly to fill the 
frame without leaving triangular gaps?

Chapter 8
230
You can reject the iPad’s proposal (tap RESET). Or you can tilt the photo 
more or less (drag your finger vertically to the right of the photo), up to 
90 degrees.
If you want to rotate the photo more than 90 degrees— for example, if the 
camera took it sideways—tap 5 as many times as necessary to turn the 
picture upright. 
The other work you can do in this mode is cropping. 
Cropping means shaving off unnecessary portions of a photo. Usually, you 
crop a photo to improve its composition—adjusting where the subject 
appears within the frame of the picture. Often, a photo has more impact 
if it’s cropped tightly around the subject, especially in portraits. Or maybe 
you want to crop out wasted space, like big expanses of background sky. 
If necessary, you can even chop a former romantic interest out of an oth-
erwise perfect family portrait. 
Cropping is also very useful if your photo needs to have a certain aspect 
ratio (length-to-width proportion), like 8 × 10 or 5 × 7. 
To crop a photo you’ve opened, tap ·, if it’s not already selected. A white 
border appears around your photo. Drag inward on any edge or corner. 
The part of the photo that the iPad will eventually trim away is darkened. 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
231
You can re-center the photo within your cropping frame by dragging any 
part of the photo, inside or outside the white box. Adjust the frame and 
drag the photo until everything looks just right.
Ordinarily, you can create a cropping rectangle of any size and propor-
tions, freehand. But if you tap 4, you get a choice of eight canned pro-
portions: Square, 3 × 2, 3 × 5, 4 × 3, and so on. They make the app limit the 
cropping frame to preset proportions. 
This aspect-ratio feature is especially important if you plan to order prints 
of your photos. Prints come only in standard photo sizes: 4 × 6, 5 × 7, 
8 × 10, and so on. But unless you crop them, the iPad’s photos are all 3 × 2, 
which doesn’t divide evenly into most standard print photograph sizes. 
Limiting your cropping to one of these standard sizes guarantees that 
your cropped photos will fit perfectly into Kodak prints. (If you don’t con-
strain your cropping this way, then Kodak—not you—will decide how to 
crop them to fit.)
Tip: The Original option here maintains the proportions of the original 
photo even as you make the grid smaller.
When you tap one of the preset sizes, the cropping frame stays in those 
proportions as you drag its edges. It’s locked in those proportions unless 
you tap 4 and choose a different setting.

Chapter 8
232
Adjust Color (2)
The people have spoken: They want control over color, white balance, tint, 
and so on. In iOS 8, you get it—in spades.
When you tap 2, you’re offered three adjustment categories: Light, Color, 
and B&W.
When you tap one of these categories, you see a “filmstrip” beside your 
photo. You can drag your finger across it, watching the effect on your 
photo. 
Tip: Actually, when you’re making any of the adjustments described on 
these pages, you don’t have to drag across the filmstrip. You can 
drag your finger left or right across the photo itself—a bigger target.
As it turns out, each of these sliders controls a handful of variables, all of 
which it’s changing simultaneously. For example, adjusting the Light slider 
affects the exposure, contrast, brights, and darks all at once (below).

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
233
Intriguingly, you can tap Ç to see how the master slider has affected 
these qualities—or even adjust these sub-sliders yourself. For example:
• Light. When you drag your finger along the Light filmstrip, you’re 
adjusting the exposure and contrast of the photo. Often, a slight 
tweak is all it takes to bring a lot more detail out of the shot.
For much finer control, tap Ç. You open your “drawer” of additional 
controls: Exposure (adjusts the brightness of all pixels), Highlights 
(pulls lost details out of very bright areas), Shadows (pulls lost de-
tails out of very dark areas), Brightness (like Exposure, but doesn’t 
brighten parts that are already bright), Contrast (heightens the dif-
ference between the brightest and darkest areas), Black Point (de-
termines what is “black”; shifts the entire dark/light range upward or 
downward). Once again, you drag your finger along the “film strip” (or 
the photo itself) to watch the effect on your photo above.
• Color. The Color filmstrip adjusts the tint and intensity of the photos’ 
colors. Here again, just a nudge can sometimes liven a dull photo or 
make blue skies “pop” just a little more.
Tap Ç to see the three sliders that make up the master Color con-
trol. They are Saturation (intensity of the colors—from vivid fake-look-
ing Disney all the way down to black and white), Contrast (deepens 

Chapter 8
234
the most saturated colors), and Cast (adjusts the color tint of the 
photo, making it warmer or darker overall).
• B&W stands for black and white. The instant you touch this filmstrip, 
your photo goes monochrome, like a black-and-white photo. It’s hard 
to describe exactly what happens when you drag your finger—you 
just have to try it—except to note that the app plays with the relative 
tones of blacks, grays, and whites, creating variations on the black-
and-white theme.
Tap Ç to see the component sliders: Intensity (the strength of the 
lightening/darkening effect), Neutrals (brightness of the middle 
grays), Tone (intensifies the brightest and darkest areas), and Grain 
(simulates the “grain”—the texture—of film prints; the farther you 
move the slider, the higher the “speed of the film” and the more visi-
ble the grain).
Tip: You can perform all of these adjustments with the iPad held either 
horizontally or vertically. The filmstrip jumps to the right side of the 
screen accordingly.
At any point, you can back out of what you’re doing by tapping an adjust-
ment heading. For example, if you’re fiddling with one of the Color sub-​slid-
ers (Contrast or Saturation, for example), tap Light, Color, or B&W to exit 
the sub-slider. 
And, of course, you can tap Cancel (and then Discard Changes) to aban-
don your editing altogether, or Done to save the edited photo and close 
the editing controls.
It might seem odd trying to perform these Photoshop-like tweaks on a 
tablet, but the power is here if you need it.
Filters (A)
Square photos weren’t the only influence that Apple felt from the popu-
larity of Facebook’s Instagram app. It also became clear that the masses 
want filters, special effects that degrade the color of your photo in artsy 
ways. (They can affect either square or regular photos.) You, too, can make 
your pictures look old, washed-out, or oversaturated. 
To view your options, tap the A icon. You see a strip of eight color filters 
(and black-and-white filters); None is always at the top. 
Tap a filter thumbnail to try it on for size. In essence, each filter turns your 
photo into a variation of black-and-white or plays with its saturation (color 
intensity, dialing it up or down). Finish by tapping Done (if you like the 
change) or Cancel (if you don’t).

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
235
By the way, you can return to a photo even months later to remove the fil-
ter; tap A again and tap None.
(Don’t these filters more or less duplicate the effects of the Light, Color, 
and B&W sliders described already? Yes. But filters produce canned, one-
tap, instant changes that don’t require as much tweaking.)
Handing Off to Other Editing Apps
OK, Apple: Who are you, and what have you done with the company that 
used to believe in closed systems?
In iOS 8, for the first time, there’s an option to hand off a photo you’re edit-
ing to another company’s editing app! Maybe you’re a fan of Camera Plus, 

Chapter 8
236
Fragment, or some other photo app. Now its tools can seem as though 
they’re built right into the Photos app!
Here’s the drill: Open a photo in Photos. Tap Edit. Tap 3. Now you see the 
icons of all apps on your iPad that have been updated to work with this 
iOS 8 Exensibility feature. (If you don’t have any such apps, the 3 button 
doesn’t appear.)
When you tap the app you want, the photo opens immediately in that app, 
with all of its editing features available. You can freely bounce back and 
forth between Apple’s editor and its competitors’. 
Saving Your Changes
Once you’ve rotated, cropped, or auto-enhanced a photo, tap the Done 
button. You’ve just made your changes permanent. 
Actually, you’ve made them temporarily permanent. You can return to an 
edited photo at any time to undo the changes you’ve made (in Edit mode, 
tap Revert). When you send the photo off the iPad (by email, to your com-
puter, whatever), that copy freezes the edits in place—but the copy on 
your iPad is still revert-able.
Tip: If you sync your photos to iPhoto or Aperture on the Mac, they 
show up in their edited condition. Yet, amazingly, you can undo or 
modify the edits there! The original photo is still lurking behind the 
edited version. You can use your Mac’s Crop tool to adjust the crop, 
for example. Or you can use iPhoto’s Revert to Original command to 
throw away all the edits you made to the original photo while it was 
on the iPad.
753 Ways to Use Photos and Videos
Once you’ve taken a picture, you can do something with it right away. 
Mail it, text it, post it to Facebook or Twitter—all right from the iPad (if it’s 
online, of course).
That’s all useful when you’re out shopping and want to seek your spouse’s 
opinion on something you’re about to buy. It’s handy when you want to 
remember the parking-garage section where you parked (“4 South”). It’s 
great when you want to give your Twitter fans a glimpse of whatever hell 
or heaven you’re experiencing at the moment.
In iOS 8, the world of ways you can send pictures or videos has exploded; 
now you can hand one off either to an online entity (Facebook, Twitter, 
Flickr, and so on) or to another app on your iPad. Want to see? Read on.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos

Choose the Photos
Before you can send or post a photo or a video, you have to tell iOS which 
one (or ones) you want to work with. 
To send just one, well, there’s no big mystery; tap its thumbnail, and then 
tap P.
But you can also send a bunch of them in a group. How you do so, how-
ever, depends on where you start:
• A Moment. You can’t choose batches of photos when you’re looking 
at a Year or a Collection. But every Moment bears a Share button next 
to its name. Tap it.
If there aren’t many photos in the Moment, you get a choice: Share 
this moment (send the entire batch) or Share some photos (you’re 
offered a page of thumbnails, so you can choose only a lucky few). If 
there are too many photos in the Moment to send in one batch, you 
go directly to the thumbnail page; choose only the ones worth send-
ing, and then tap Share.
• Photos from the Albums tab. If you begin instead on a page of 
thumbnails from the Albums tab, you can tap Select and then individ-
ually select the photos you want to send. With each tap, a l appears, 
meaning, “OK, this one will be included.” (Tap again to remove the 
checkmark.) Then tap P.
Either way, the next thing you see is the Share sheet described below. 
Starting from the Albums tab gains you a couple of additional options, by 
the way:
• Delete a batch. The T button lets you delete a bunch of photos at 
once. (You can delete only photos or videos you’ve taken with the 
iPad—not ones you transferred from your computer.) 
• Create or delete albums. Add To lets you put the selected photos 
into one of your albums—a great way to organize a huge batch you’ve 
shot on vacation, for example. 
You’re now offered an Add to Album screen. Tap the album into 
which you want to move these pictures. (If albums are dimmed, that’s 
because they’ve been synced from your Mac or PC. You’re not al-
lowed to mess with them. The canned specialty-photo folders, like 
Panorama and Time-Lapse, are also dimmed, because only iOS can 
put things into those folders.)
This list also includes a New Album button; you’re asked to type out 
the name you want for the new album and then tap Save.

Chapter 8
238
Note: These buttons don’t actually move photos out of their original 
albums. You’re creating aliases of them—pointers to the original 
photos. If you edit or delete a photo from one album, it’s edited 
or deleted from all of them.
To delete an album you created on the iPad, start on the main Albums 
tab. Tap Edit, and then tap the – button next to the album you want 
to delete. 
Preparing to Send
Once you’ve opened a photo (or selected a few), tap P. 
Now you have a huge array of “send my photo here” options, displayed in 
three rows. Two of them scroll horizontally. 
All right then. Here’s an overview of the options available on the Share 
screen.
AirDrop
So very cool: You can shoot a photo, or several, to any nearby iPad, iPhone, 
iPod Touch, or Mac—wirelessly, securely, conveniently, and instantly. See 
page 455 for the step-by-steps.
Message
You can also send a photo or video to another Apple gadget as an iMes-
sage (or, if you also own an iPhone, to any cellphone number; see page 
122). 
Address your message, type a little note, tap Send, and off it goes. All of 
this is described in Chapter 5.
Note: If you’re sending a video, the iPad compresses it first so that it’s 
small enough to send as a text-message attachment (smaller 
dimensions, lower picture quality). Then it attaches the clip to an 
outgoing text message; it’s your job to address it.
Mail
The iPad automatically compresses, rotates, and attaches your photos or 
video clips to a new outgoing message. All you have to do is address it 
and hit Send. 
If it’s a really big file (from a pro SLR camera, for example), you may be 
asked how much you want the photo scaled down from its original size, 
since many email systems reject attachments larger than 5 megabytes. 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
239
Tap Small, Medium, Large, or Actual Size, using the megabyte indicator 
as a guide. 
(Any video clip you send by email gets compressed—smaller, lower qual-
ity—for the same reason.)
Tip: Using the steps on page 237, you can send up to five photos at 
once. The Mail icon doesn’t appear at all if you’ve selected more 
than that; it’s too big for one attachment.
iCloud Photo Sharing
You can share batches of photos or videos with other people, either 
directly to their Apple gadgets or to a private Web page. What’s more, 
they can (at your option) contribute their own pictures to the album. 
This is a big topic, though, so it gets its own write-up on page 250.
Twitter, Facebook, Flickr
If you’ve told your iPad what your name and password are (in SettingsÆ​​
Twitter or SettingsÆFacebook or SettingsÆFlickr), then posting a photo 
from your iPad to your Twitter feed, Facebook feed, or Flickr collection is 
ridiculously simple. 

Chapter 8
240
You’re offered the chance to type a message that accompanies your photo, 
as shown below. (As usual with Twitter, you have a maximum of 140 char-
acters for your message. Fewer, actually, because some of your characters 
are eaten up by the link to the photo.) You can also tap Add Location if 
you want Twitterites or Facebookers to know where the photo was taken.
Note: The Add Location option is available only if you’ve permitted 
Twitter or Facebook to use your location information, which you 
set up in SettingsÆPrivacyÆLocation Services.
If you’re posting to Facebook or Flickr, you can also indicate whom you’re 
sharing this item with—just your friends, everyone, and so on—by tap-
ping Audience beneath the photo thumbnail. Flickr also offers a chance to 
specify which of your Flickr photo sets you want to post to.
When you tap Send or Post, your photo, and your accompanying tweet or 
post, zoom off to Twitter, Facebook, or Flickr for all to enjoy. 
YouTube, Vimeo
And you were alive to see the day: Film a movie, edit out the boring parts, 
and then upload it to YouTube—right from the iPad.
Call up the video, if it’s not already on the screen before you. Tap P. The 
Share sheet offers these video-specific buttons: 
• YouTube. The iPad asks for your Google account name and password 
(Google owns YouTube). Next it wants a title, description, and tags 
(searchable keywords like “funny” or “babies”). 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
241
It also wants to know if the video will be in standard definition or high 
definition (and it gives the approximate size of the file). You should 
also pick a Category (Autos & Vehicles, Comedy, Education, or what-
ever). 
Finally, choose from Public (anyone online can search for and view 
your video), Unlisted (only people who have the link can view this 
video), or Private (only specific YouTubers can view). When every-
thing looks good, tap Publish.
After the upload is complete, you’re offered the chance to see the 
video as it now appears on YouTube, or to Tell a Friend (that is, to 
email the YouTube link to a pal). Both are excellent ways to admire 
your masterful cinematography.
• Vimeo. You’re supposed to have set up your name and password in 
Settings for Vimeo (a video site a lot like YouTube, but classier, with a 
greater emphasis on quality and artistry).
If you’ve done that, then all you have to do, when posting a video, is 
to specify a caption or a description, and then tap Details to choose 
a video size and who your audience is (public, private, and so on). 
Once you tap Post, your video gets sent on to the great cinema on 
the Web.
More
In the new, improved, extendable iOS, you can hand off a photo to other 
apps and services—beyond the set that Apple provides. If you tap More, 
you get this screen:

Chapter 8
242
This screen is basically a setup headquarters for the row of “where you can 
send photos” icons. Here you can rearrange them (put the ones you use 
most often at the top by dragging the H handle); add to the list (turn on 
the switches for new, non-Apple photo-sharing apps you’ve installed); or 
hide the services you don’t use (turn off the switches). (You can’t turn off 
the switches for Message, Mail, and iCloud Photo Sharing.)
Copy
The Copy button, on the bottom row of sharing options, puts the pho-
to(s) onto the Clipboard, ready for pasting into another app (an outgoing 
Mail message, for example). Once you’ve opened an app that can, in fact, 
accept pasted graphics, double-tap to make the Paste button appear.
Slideshow
A slideshow is a great way to show off your photos and videos. The catch: 
The Slideshow button appears only on an entire album of photos—no 
other grouping. If you want some arbitrary batch of pictures in your slide-
show, then put them into an album first.
You have a surprising amount of control over your slideshow, too. But 
beware: The controls are split up between two locations. Some of them 
appear when you first tap Slideshow:
• TV or iPad. Where do you want the slideshow? On your iPad or on 
your TV? (This option appears only if you have an Apple TV.)
• Transitions. What kind of crossfade or special effect do you want the 
iPad to create in the blend from one photo to the next? You’re offered 
five choices—Dissolve, Cube, Ripple, Wipe Across, Wipe Down. 
(Dissolve is the least tacky one.)
• Play Music. Would you like tunes with that? If you want background 
music, turn this switch on. 
• Music. Finally, tap the Music pop-up menu to choose a song from 
your music collection.
The other set of controls is buried in SettingsÆPhotos & Camera:
• Play Each Slide For. You can specify how many seconds each photo 
hangs around.
• Repeat. Makes the slideshow play over and over again until you stop 
it manually.
• Shuffle. Randomizes the sequence of photos within the chosen 
album. 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos

While the slideshow is going on, tapping the screen stops the show, freez-
ing it on the current photo. If you open the Share sheet and tap Slideshow 
again, you resume the slideshow. 
You must let each video play to its conclusion if you want the show to 
continue. (Or tap to interrupt a particularly boring video, swipe to the next 
photo or video, and start the slideshow again from there.)
You can feel free to turn the iPad 90 degrees to accommodate land-
scape-orientation photos as they come up; the slideshow keeps right on 
going.
AirPlay
This button offers a list of nearby AirPlay gadgets—the only one you’ve 
probably heard of is Apple TV—so that you can display the current photo 
on your TV or another screen.
Save Image
Suppose you’re looking at a photo that you didn’t take with the iPad. Maybe 
someone texted or emailed it to you, for example. This button saves it into 
your own photo collection, so you’ll be able to cherish it for years.

Assign to Contact
If you’re viewing a photo of somebody who’s listed in Contacts, then you 
can use it (or part of it) as her headshot. After that, her photo appears on 
your screen every time she calls. Just tap Assign to Contact. 
Your address book list pops up. Tap the name of the person who goes with 
this photo.
Now you see a preview of what the photo will look like when that person 
calls. This is the Move and Scale screen. You want to crop the photo and 
shift it in the frame so only that person is visible (if it’s a group shot)—in 
fact, just the face.
Start by enlarging the photo: Spread your thumb and forefinger against 
the glass. As you go, shift the photo’s placement in the round frame with 
a one-finger drag. When you’ve got the person correctly centered, tap 
Choose.
Use as Wallpaper
Wallpaper, in the world of iOS, refers to the background photo that 
appears in either of two places: the Home screen (plastered behind your 
app icons) or the Lock screen (which appears every time you wake the 
iPad). 
You can replace Apple’s standard photos with one of your photos or with 
a different one of Apple’s. You go at this task in either of two ways:
• Start in Settings. Tap SettingsÆWallpaper. 
Now you see miniatures of the two places you can install wallpaper—
the Lock screen and the Home screen (facing page, top). Each shows 
what you’ve got installed there as wallpaper at the moment. 
Tip: You can tap either screen miniature to open a Set screen, where you 
can adjust the current photo’s size and positioning.
When you tap Choose a New Wallpaper, you’re shown a list of photo 
sources you can use as backgrounds. Under Apple Wallpaper, you get 
two categories worth noticing.
The Dynamic wallpapers all look like soft-focus bubbles against solid-
color backgrounds. Once you’ve installed the wallpaper, these bubbles 
actually move, rising and falling on your Lock screen or on your Home 
screen behind your icons. Yes, animated wallpaper has come to the 
iPad.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
245
The Stills category is a bunch of lovely nature photography. It doesn’t 
move.
Scroll down a little, and you’ll find your own photos, in the form of the 
Camera Roll, Photo Stream, Panoramas, and Albums categories, as 
described earlier in this chapter.
All these pictures show up as thumbnail miniatures; tap one to see 
what it looks like at full size. If it looks good, tap Set. 
TIP: Complicated, “busy” photos may make it harder to read icons and 
icon names on the Home screen.

Chapter 8
246
Now the iPad wants to know which of the two places you want to use 
this wallpaper; tap Set Lock Screen, Set Home Screen, or Set Both (if 
you want the same picture in both places).
• Start in the Photos app. The task of applying one of your own photos 
to your Home or Lock screen can also begin in the Photos app. Open 
one of your photos, as described in the previous pages. Tap P, and 
then tap Use as Wallpaper.
You’re now offered the Move and Scale screen so you can fit your 
photo within the wallpaper “frame.” Pinch or spread to enlarge the 
shot; drag your finger on the screen to scroll and center it. 
Finally, tap Set. Here again, you specify where you want to use this 
wallpaper; tap Set Lock Screen, Set Home Screen, or Set Both (if you 
want the same picture in both places).
Print
You can print a photo easily enough, provided that you’ve hooked up your 
iPad to a compatible printer. Once you’ve opened the photo, tap the P 
button and then tap Print. The rest goes down as described on page 210.
More
Once again, iOS 8 now offers a way to rearrange the Share buttons (this 
time, the second row)—or to add new buttons. They appear automatically 
when you install certain apps that have photo-sharing capabilities.
My Photo Stream
iCloud is Apple’s free suite of online services. It’s described in Chapter 15—
but for an iPad shutterbug, its most interesting feature by far is My Photo 
Stream.
The concept is simple: Every time a new photo enters your life—when you 
take a picture with your iPad or import one onto your computer—it gets 
added to your Photo Stream. From there, it appears automatically on all 
your other Apple machines. 
Note: Even if you have a cellular iPad, Photo Stream syncs only when 
you’re in a WiFi hotspot.
Using Photo Stream means all kinds of good things:
• 	Your photos are always backed up. Lose your iPad? No biggie—
when you buy a new one, your latest 1,000 photos appear on it 
automatically.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
247
• 	Any pictures you take with your iPad appear automatically on your 
computer. You don’t have to connect any cables or sync anything 
yourself. 
Tip: Actually, there’s one exception. Suppose you take a photo and then 
delete it while you’re still in the Camera app; that photo will never 
become part of your Photo Stream.
A similar rule holds true with edits: If you edit a photo you’ve just 
taken, those edits become part of the Photo Stream copy. But if you 
take a photo, leave the Camera app, and later edit it, then the Photo 
Stream gets the original copy only.
Here’s a sneaky one: You can drag favorite photos into your Photo Stream 
from your computer’s photo stash—a quick, easy way to get pictures from 
your computer onto your iPad. 
To get started with Photo Stream on your iPad, you have to turn on My 
Photo Stream, which you do in SettingsÆiCloud. (You should also turn 
it on using the iCloud control panel on your computer. That’s in System 
Preferences on your Mac, or in the Control Panel of Windows.) Give your 
iPad some time in a WiFi hotspot to form its initial slurping-in of all your 
most recent photos.
Once Photo Stream is up and running, here’s how to use it.

Chapter 8
248
On the iPad
Open your Photos app. Tap the tab at the bottom called Albums; in the 
list of albums, tap My Photo Stream. Inside are the 1,000 photos that have 
entered your life most recently.
Now, your i-gadget doesn’t have nearly as much storage available as your 
Mac or PC; you can’t yet buy an iPad with 750 gigabytes of storage. That’s 
why, on your iPad/iPhone/iPod, your My Photo Stream consists of just the 
last 1,000 photos. (There’s another limitation, too: The iCloud servers store 
your photos for 30 days. As long as your gadgets go online at least once 
a month, they’ll remain current with the Photo Stream.)
Ordinarily, the oldest of the 1,000 photos in your Photo Stream scroll away 
forever as new photos come in. But you can rescue the best ones from 
that fate—by saving them onto your iPad, where they’re free from the risk 
of automatic deletion.
To rescue a bunch at a time, open My Photo Stream so you’re looking over 
the thumbnails. Tap Select, and then tap the thumbnails of the photos you 
want to preserve. Once they’re selected, tap Add To (and then choose one 
of your iPad’s albums); or tap the P button and tap Save Images.
Or, if you’re viewing one open picture in My Photo Stream, tap the P but-
ton; on the Share sheet, tap Save to Camera Roll. 
That’s it. Now the photos you rescued appear in both your Photo Stream, 
where they will eventually disappear, and in your albums, where they’re 
safe until you delete them manually.
On the Mac or PC
In iPhoto or Aperture (Mac), your Photo Stream photos appear in a new 
monthly album called, of course, Photo Stream. On a Windows PC, you get 
a Photo Stream folder in your Pictures folder.
On the computer, you don’t have to worry about that 30-day, 1,000-photo 
business. Once pictures appear here, they’re here until you delete them.
This, in its way, is one of the best features in all of iCloudland, because it 
means you don’t have to sync your iPad over a USB cable to get your pho-
tos onto your computer. It all happens automatically, wirelessly over WiFi.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
249
Tip: You can also drag photos into your Photo Stream from your 
computer. That’s a quick, easy way to get them onto your iPad 
wirelessly. On the Mac, drag the photos into the Photo Stream 
album (within iPhoto or Aperture), and choose whether you want 
them dropped into your main Photo Stream or one of your shared 
ones. In Windows, drag them into the Photo Stream Uploads folder, 
which you designate in the iCloud Control Panel.
On the Apple TV
When you’re viewing your photos on an Apple TV, an album appears there 
called Photo Stream. There they are, ready for showing on the big plasma. 
You can use your Photo Stream in an Apple TV screen saver, too.
Deleting Photos from the Photo Stream
You can’t choose what photos go into the Photo Stream. Every picture 
you take with the iPad goes into it. Every photo you bring in from your 
computer goes into it. Every photo you save on your iPad from an app like 
Twitter goes into it. Every screenshot you make goes into it. 
And, remember, the same 1,000 photos appear on all your Apple gadgets 
(assuming you’ve turned on Photo Stream on each one). You might think 
you’re taking a private picture with your iPad, forgetting that your spouse 
or parent will see it seconds later on that person’s iPhone. It’s only a matter 
of time before Photo Stream gets some politician in big trouble.
Even if you delete a photo from your iPad’s Camera Roll, it’s too late. 
The Photo Stream version is already out there, replicated across all your 
i-gadgets and computers.
Fortunately, you can delete photos from your Photo Stream. Just select 
the thumbnail of the photo you want to delete, and then tap the Trash icon 
(T). The confirmation box warns you that you’re about to delete the photo 
from all your Apple machines (and, for shared streams, the machines of 
everyone who’s subscribed to your photographic output).
If you haven’t saved it to a different album or roll, it’s gone for good when 
you tap Delete Photo.
Tip: If you use iPhoto or Aperture, don’t forget that these programs 
offer an Auto-Import feature in their Preferences. That is, any 
photo that appears in the Photo Stream album automatically gets 
imported into the program’s permanent collection. In the event of 
an Embarrassing Photo Stream Mistake, don’t forget to delete that 
auto-imported copy of the incriminating photos, too.

iCloud Photo Sharing
The term “iCloud Photo Sharing,” new in iOS 8, is what used to be called a 
shared Photo Stream. It lets you send photos or videos to other people’s 
gadgets. After a party or some other get-together, you could send your 
best shots to everyone who attended; after a trip, you could post your 
photographic memories for anyone who might care. 
The lucky recipients can post comments about your pix, click a “like” but-
ton to indicate their enthusiasm, or even submit pictures and videos of 
their own. It’s like having a tiny Instagram network of your very own, con-
sisting solely of people you invite.
In designing this feature, Apple had quite a challenge. There’s a lot of 
back-and-forth among multiple people, sharing multiple photos, so iCloud 
Photo Sharing can get a little complicated. Stay calm and keep your hands 
and feet inside the tram at all times. Here’s how it works.
Tip: Well, here’s how it works if your equipment meets the requirements. 
Photo Albums can show up on an i-gadget with iOS 7 or later; on a 
Mac with OS X Mavericks (10.9) or later and iPhoto 9.5 or Aperture 
3.5 or later; on a PC with Windows 7 or later and the iCloud Control 
Panel 3.0; or on an Apple TV (2nd Generation) with Software 
Update 6.0 or later.
You also have to turn on the Photo Album feature. On an iOS 
gadget, the switch is in SettingsÆiCloudÆPhotos; turn on iCloud 
Photo Sharing. On the Mac, open System PreferencesÆiCloud. Make 
sure Photos is turned on; click Options and confirm that Photo 
Sharing is on, too. On a Windows PC, it’s in the iCloud Control Panel 
for Windows (a free download from Apple’s Web site).
Create a Shared Photo Album
To share some of your masterpieces with your adoring fans, proceed like 
this:
1.	 Create the empty album. Open the Photos app. On the Shared tab, 
scroll to the bottom of the list (if necessary) and tap New Shared 
Album. 
2.	 Name the new album. In the Shared Album box, name the Photo 
Album (“Bday Fun” or whatever). Tap Next.
3.	 Specify the audience. You’re now asked for the email addresses of 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
251
your lucky audience members; enter their addresses in the “To:” box 
just as you would address an outgoing email. For your convenience, a 
list of recent sharees appears below the “To:” box.
When that’s done, tap Create. You return to the list of shared albums, 
where your newly named album appears at the top. It is, however, 
completely empty. 
4.	 Pour some photos or movies into the album. Tap your new, empty 
album’s name. Then, on the empty next screen, tap the + button to 
burrow through your photos and videos—you can use any of the 
three tabs (Photos, Shared, Albums)—to select the material you want 
to share. Tap their thumbnails so that they sprout checkmarks, and 
then tap Done.
A little box appears so that you can type up a description. 
5.	 Type a description of the new batch. In theory, you and other people 
can add to this album later. That’s why you’re offered the chance to 
caption each new batch.
Once that’s done, tap Post. 
The thumbnails of the shared photos and videos appear before you—and 
the + button is there, too, in case you want to add more pictures later.
Tip: You can easily remove photos from the album, too. On this screen of 
thumbnails, tap Select; tap the thumbnails you want to nuke; tap T; 
confirm by tapping Delete Photo.
Adjusting an Album’s Settings
Before you set your album free, tap People at the top of the screen. Here 
are a few important options to establish for this album:
• Invite People. This list identifies everyone with whom you’ve shared 
the album. To add a new subscriber, tap Invite People. To delete a 
subscriber, tap the name and then (at the bottom of the contact 
card) tap Remove Subscriber.
• Subscribers Can Post. Your subscribers can contribute photos and 
videos to your album. That’s a fantastic feature when it contains pic-
tures of an event where there was a crowd: a wedding, show, concert, 
picnic, badminton tournament. Now all the people who were there 
can enhance the gallery with shots taken from their own points of 
view with their own iPads or cameras.
• Public Website. If you turn on Public Website, then even people who 
aren’t members of the Apple cult will be able to see these photos. The 

Chapter 8
252
invitees will get an email containing a Web address. It links to a hid-
den page on the iCloud Web site that contains your published photos.
When you turn this switch on, the Web address of your new gallery 
appears in light-gray type. Tap Share Link for a selection of methods 
for sending the link to people: by Message, Mail, Twitter, Facebook, 
AirDrop, and so on.
What they’ll see is a mosaic of pictures, laid out in a grid on a single 
sort of Web poster. Your fans can download their favorites by clicking 
the U button. (You can’t add comments or “like” photos on the Web, 
however.)
TIP: If you click one of these medium-sized photos, you enter slideshow 
mode, in which one photo at a time fills your Web browser window. 
Click the arrow buttons to move through them.
• Notifications. If this switch is on, then your iPad will show a banner 
each time someone adds photos or videos to your album, clicks the 
“Like” button for a photo, or leaves a comment. 
• Delete Shared Album. That’s right: If the whole thing gets out of 
hand, you can slam the door in your subscribers’ faces by making the 
entire album disappear.

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
253
Read on to see what it’s like to be the person whose email address you 
entered.
Receiving a Photo Album on Your Gadget
When other people share Photo Albums with you, your iPad makes a little 
warble, and a notification banner appears: “[Your buddy’s name] invited 
you to join ‘[name of shared photo batch]’.” 
Simultaneously, a badge like (@) appears on the Photos app icon and on 
the Shared tab within Photos, letting you know how many albums have 
come your way. 
As you’d guess, you can tap the new album’s name to see what’s inside it; 
tap Accept if you want to join.
Once you’re subscribed, you view the photos and movies as you would 
any album—with a couple of differences. First, you can tap Add a com-
ment to make worshipful or snarky remarks, or tap the Like smiley to offer 
your silent support.

Chapter 8
254
Tip: Either you or the photo’s owner can delete one of your comments. 
To do that, hold your finger down on the comment itself and then 
tap the Delete button that appears.
You can also snag a copy of somebody’s published photo or video for 
yourself. With the photo before you, tap the P button to see the usual 
sharing options—and tap Save Image. Now the picture or video isn’t some 
virtual online wisp—it’s a solid, tangible electronic copy in your own photo 
pool.
If your buddy has turned on Subscribers Can Post for this album, you can 
send your own photos and clips into the album; everybody who’s sub-
scribed to it (and, of course, its owner) will see them.
To do that, tap the + button on the album’s page of thumbnails; choose 
your photos and movies; tap Done; add a little comment about them; and 
tap Post.
Fun with Shared Photo Albums
Once you’ve created a shared Photo Album, you can update it or modify 
it in all kinds of ways:
• Add new photos or movies to it. In Photos, open the shared Photo 
Album, whether it’s one you created or one you’ve subscribed to. Tap 
the + button. Now you can browse your whole world of photos, tap-
ping to add them to the Photo Album already in progress.
• Remove things from it. In Photos, open the shared Photo Album. Tap 
Select, tap the item(s) you want to delete, and then tap the Trash icon 
(T)—and confirm with a tap on Delete Photo(s).
• Delete an entire shared Photo Album. Tap the People tab below an 
open Photo Album, scroll down, tap Delete Shared Album, and con-
firm by tapping Delete.
• Change who’s invited, change the name. The People tab is also 
where you can add to the list of email addresses (tap Invite People), 
remove someone (tap the name, and then tap Remove Subscriber), 
rename the album, or turn off Public Website to dismantle the Web 
version of this gallery.
At any time, you can tap the Activity “folder” at the top of the Shared tab 
in the Photos app. Here, for your amusement, is a visual record of every-
thing that’s gone on in Shared Photo Album Land: photos you’ve posted, 
photos other people have posted, comments back and forth, “likes,” and 
so on. It’s your personal photographic Facebook.

iCloud Photo Library
If learning the difference between My Photo Stream, iCloud Photo Sharing, 
and Shared Photo Streams isn’t hard enough, then hold onto your lens 
cap. With iOS 8, Apple introduces yet another online photo feature: the 
iCloud Photo Library.
The idea this time is that all your Apple gadgets will keep all your photos 
and videos backed up online and synced. The advantages:
• 	All your photos and videos are always backed up.
• 	All your photos and videos are always accessible from any of your 
gadgets.
• 	You can reclaim a lot of space on your iPad. There’s an option that 
offloads the original photos and videos to iCloud but leaves small, 
iPad-sized copies on your iPad. 
There are a couple of sizable downsides to iCloud Photo Library, too:
• 	Photos and videos eat up a lot of storage space. Remember, your 
entire iCloud account comes with only 5 gigabytes of free storage. If 
you start backing up your photo library to it, too, you’ll almost cer-
tainly have to pay to expand your iCloud storage.
• 	Things get a little complicated. The structure of the Photos app 
described in this chapter changes, for example; the albums usually 
called Camera Roll and My Photo Stream go away. They’re replaced 
by a new album called All Photos. (Camera Roll and My Photo Stream 
were just subsets of your whole photographic life anyway.)
If you decide to dive in, then open SettingsÆiCloudÆPhotosÆiCloud 
Photo Library. (It may be labeled “Beta,” meaning that this service is still 
in testing.) 
Once iCloud Photo Library is on, you won’t be able to copy pictures from 
your computer to your iPad using iTunes anymore; iTunes will be com-
pletely removed from the photo-management loop. That’s why, at this 
point, you may be warned that your iPad is about to delete any pho-
tos and videos that you’ve synced to it from iTunes (page 426). (Don’t 
worry—they’ll be safe on iCloud.) 
And, of course, you might be warned that you need to buy more iCloud 
storage space.

Chapter 8
256
Now the Settings panel expands and offers this important choice:
• Optimize iPad Storage. If your iPad’s storage ever begins to fill up, 
iCloud will quietly and automatically replace the iPad’s full-resolution 
copies of your photos with smaller versions. They’re still big enough 
to view on the iPad’s screen and even zoom in a little, but they’re 
nothing like the full, printable originals. 
If space gets tighter yet, your iPad gets even lower-resolution copies. 
Of course, your originals are always safe on iCloud; whenever you try 
to do something with one of these photos, like sending it or editing it, 
your iPad quickly downloads the full-quality original and works with 
that. Meanwhile, this arrangement saves you a ton of space on your 
iPad.
• Download and Keep Originals leaves the big original files on your 
iPad.
Finally, the uploading process begins. If you have a lot of photos and vid-
eos, it can take a very long time. 
But when it’s all over, you’ll have instant access to all your photos and vid-
eos in any of these places:
• On the iPad (or other iOS gadgets). In the Photos app, on the Photos 
tab, the new “album” called All Photos represents your new, online 
photo library. Add to, delete from, or edit pictures in this set, and 
you’ll find the same changes made on all your other Apple gear.
• On the Web. You can sign into iCloud.com and click Photos to view 
your photos and videos, no matter what machine you’re using. The 
Moments and Albums tabs here correspond to the tabs in the iPad’s 

Taking Photos, Shooting Videos
257
Photos app. Click a photo to open it full-size, whereupon the icons at 
the top of the screen let you delete, download, or “favorite” it.
• On the Mac, eventually. Apple intends to kill off iPhoto and Aperture, 
its photo-management programs, and replace them with a new Mac 
program called Photos. Until this new program hatches in “early 2015,” 
you have no way to work with your photo library using a Mac. You’ve 
been warned.
Capturing the Screen
Let’s say you want to write a book about the iPad. (Hey, it could happen.) 
How are you supposed to illustrate that book? How can you take pictures 
of what’s on the screen?
The trick is very simple: Get the screen just the way you want it, even if 
that means holding your finger down on an onscreen button or a keyboard 
key. Now hold down the Home button, and while it’s down, press the Sleep 
switch at the top of the iPad. (Yes, you may need to invite some friends 
over to help you execute this multiple-finger move.)
The screen flashes white. Now, if you go to the Photos program and open 
up the Camera Roll, you see a crisp, colorful image, in PNG format, of 
whatever was on the screen. (Its resolution matches the screen’s.)
At this point, you can send it by email (to illustrate a request for help, for 
example, or to send a screen from Maps to a friend who’s driving your 
way); sync it with your computer (to add it to your Mac or Windows photo 
collection); or designate it as the iPad’s wallpaper (to confuse the heck out 
of its owner).

A
pp is short for application, meaning software program, and 
the App Store is a single, centralized catalog of every author­
ized iPad add-on program in the world. In fact, it’s the only 
place where you can get new programs. 
You hear people talking about downsides to this approach: Apple’s sti-
fling the competition; Apple’s taking a 30 percent cut of every app sold; 
Apple’s maintaining veto power over apps it doesn’t like. 
But there are some enormous benefits, too. First, there’s one central place 
to look for apps. Second, Apple checks out every program to make sure 
it’s decent and runs decently. Third, the store is beautifully integrated with 
the iPad itself. 
There’s an incredible wealth of software in the App Store. These pro-
grams can turn the iPad into an instant-messaging tool, an Internet radio, 
a medical reference, a musical keyboard, a time and expense tracker, a 
TV remote control, a photo editor, a recipe box, a tip calculator, a restau-
rant finder, a teleprompter, and so on. And games—thousands of dazzling 
handheld games, some with smooth 3-D graphics and tilt control. 
About 500,000 apps have been designed for the iPad’s screen. But there 
are also 1.4 million apps that have been designed for the iPhone—and you 
can use them on the iPad, too. (They appear either double size or with a 
big black margin.)
It’s so much stuff that the challenge now is just finding your way through 
it. Thank goodness for those Most Popular lists.
Two Ways to the App Store
You can get to the App Store in two ways: from the iPad itself, or from your 
computer’s copy of the iTunes software.
All About Apps

Chapter 9
260
Using iTunes offers a much easier browsing and shopping experience, of 
course, because you’ve got a mouse, a keyboard, and that big screen. But 
downloading straight to the iPad, without ever involving the computer, is 
wicked convenient when you’re out and about.
Shopping from the iPad
To check out the App Store from your iPad, tap the App Store icon. You 
arrive at the colorful, scrolling wonder of the store itself.
It has five tabs (the icons at the bottom). Here they are, in order:
• Featured is pretty clear: You can scroll vertically to see different cate-
gories, like Best New Apps or Previews, and horizontally to see more 
apps within each category.
The top row might say “Best New Apps.” Scroll sideways to see the 
apps that Apple is recommending (See All shows all the new apps).
At the top left, the Categories button presents the entire catalog, 
organized by category: Books, Business, Education, Entertainment, 
Finance, Games, and so on. Tap a category to see what’s in it.

All About Apps
261
• Top Charts is a list of the 100 most popular programs at the moment, 
ranked by how many people have downloaded them. There are actu-
ally three lists here: the most popular free programs, the most popular 
ones that cost money (“Paid”), and which apps have made the most 
money (“Top Grossing”), even if they haven’t sold the most copies.
• Explore lists apps that are popular near you. It uses your location to 
check for geographically relevant apps. Usually, this concept is most 
useful when you’re at a public institution: a museum, baseball sta-
dium, train station, and so on. You may also see the newspaper apps 
for whatever town you’re in, or local bus and subway apps.
• Purchased. Here are all the apps you’ve ever bought. On the Not on 
This iPad tab, of course, are the ones you’ve bought on other iPads or 
iPhones, available to download to this one right now, no charge. 
• Updates. Unlike its buddies, this button isn’t intended to help you 
navigate the catalog. Instead, it lets you know when one of the pro-
grams you’ve already installed is available in a newer version. Details 
in a moment.
About a third of the App Store’s programs are free; the rest are usually 
under $5. A few, intended for professionals (pilots, for example), can cost 
a lot more.
Search
As the number of iPad apps grows into the millions, viewing by scrolling 
through lists begins to get awfully unwieldy.
Fortunately, you can also search the catalog, which is efficient if you know 
what you’re looking for (either the name of a program, the kind of pro-
gram, or the software company that made it). 
Before you even begin to type, this panel shows you a list of Trending 
Searches—that is, the most popular searches right now. Odds are pretty 
good that if you want to download the latest hot app you keep hearing 
about, you’ll see its name here (because, after all, it’s hot).
Or tap in the search box to make the keyboard appear. As you type, the list 
shrinks so that it’s showing you only the matches. You might type tetris, or 
piano, or Disney, or whatever. 
Tap anything in the results list (next page, bottom) to see a series of 
“cards,” one for each matching app. You can swipe horizontally to scroll 
through them. Tap one to view its details screen, as described below.

The App Details Page
No matter which button was your starting point, eventually you wind up 
at an app’s details screen. There’s a description, a scrolling set of screen-
shots, info about the author, the date posted, the version number, a page 
of related and similar apps, and so on. 
You can also tap Reviews to dig beyond the average star rating into the 
actual written reviews from people who’ve already tried the thing.
Why are the ratings so important? Because the App Store’s goodies aren’t 
equally good. Remember, these programs come from a huge variety of 
people—teenagers in Hungary, professional firms in Silicon Valley, col-
lege kids goofing around on weekends—and just because they made it 
into the store doesn’t mean they’re worth the money (or even the time to 
download).

Sometimes a program has a low score because it’s just not designed well 
or it doesn’t do what it’s advertised to do. And sometimes, of course, it’s 
a little buggy.
If you decide something is worth getting, scroll back to the top of the page 
and tap its price button. It may say, for example, FREE or $0.99. 
Tip: If you see a little + sign on the price button, it means that the same 
app works well on both the iPad and the iPhone.
If you’ve previously bought it, either on this iPad or on another Apple 
touchscreen gadget, then the button turns into a U; you don’t have to 
buy it again. Just tap to re-download. If, in fact, this app is already on your 
iPad, then the button says OPEN (handy!).
Once you tap the price and then INSTALL APP, you’ve committed to 
downloading the program. There are only a few things that may stand in 
your way:

Chapter 9
264
• A request for your iTunes account info. You can’t use the App Store 
without an iTunes account—even if you’re just downloading free stuff. 
If you’ve ever bought anything from the iTunes Store, signed up for 
an iCloud account, or bought anything from Apple online, then you 
already have an iTunes account (an Apple ID, meaning your email 
address and password). 
The iPad asks you to enter your iTunes account name and password 
the first time you access the App Store and periodically thereafter, 
just to make sure some marauding child in your household can’t run 
up your bill without your knowledge. Mercifully, you don’t have to en-
ter your Apple ID information just to download an update to an app 
you already own.
Tip: If you have an iPad Air 2 or mini 3 model, and you’ve taught it 
to recognize your fingerprint, here’s the payoff: When you try to 
download an app, instead of having to enter your Apple password, 
you can just touch the Home button with your finger.
• A file size over 100 megabytes. If a program is bigger than 100 MB, 
you can’t download it over the cellular airwaves to a cellular iPad, a 
policy no doubt intended to soothe nerves at AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, 
and Verizon. Instead, over-100-meg files are available only when 
you’re on a WiFi connection.
Once you begin downloading a file, a tiny progress circle next to the app’s 
name fills in to indicate the download’s progress. (Tap the square Stop 
button inside the circle to cancel the download.) When the downloading 
is done, tap the OPEN button to open it and try it out.
Tip: You don’t have to sit there and stare at the progress bar. You can go 
on working on the iPad. In fact, you can even go back to the App 
Store and start downloading something else simultaneously. You 
can easily spot your fresh downloads on the Home screens: Their 
icons fill in with color as the download proceeds, and after that their 
names are preceded by a blue dot.
Two Welcome Notes about Backups
Especially when you’ve paid good money for your iPad apps, you might 
worry about what would happen if your iPad got lost or stolen, or if some-
one (maybe you) accidentally deletes one of your precious downloads.
You don’t have to worry. Here’s a handy little fact about the App Store: It 
remembers what you’ve already bought. You can re-download a purchased 
program at any time, on any of your iPads, iPhones, or iPod Touches, with-
out having to pay for it again. 

All About Apps
265
Tip: If some program doesn’t download properly on the iPad, don’t 
sweat it. Go into iTunes on your computer and choose StoreÆCheck 
for Available Downloads. And if a program does download to the 
iPad but doesn’t transfer to iTunes, then choose FileÆTransfer 
Purchases from “iPad”. These two commands straighten things out, 
clear up the accounting, and make all well with your two copies of 
each app (iPad + computer).
Shopping in iTunes
You can also download new programs to your computer using iTunes and 
then sync them over to the iPad. By all means, use this method whenever 
you can. It’s much more efficient to use a mouse, a keyboard, and a full 
screen.
In iTunes, click the . (apps) icon at top left; at top center, click App Store. 
The screen fills with starting points for your quest, matching what you’d 
see on the iPad: Best New Apps, Best New Games, and so on.
Or use the search box at top right.
From here, the experience is the same as it is on the iPad. Drill down to 
the Details page for a program, read its description and reviews, look at 
its photos, and so on. Click the price button to download and, at the next 
sync, install it.

iPhone Apps on the iPad
Apple wrote iOS 8 to run on both iPhones and iPads. As a side effect, 
you gain one fantastically useful perk: You can run all of those 1.4 million 
iPhone apps on the iPad.
Of course, those apps are designed to run on a smaller screen. So what 
happens on the much larger iPad?
In the olden days, iPhone apps started out floating in the middle of the 
iPad screen at phone size, surrounded by a sea of black. They ran per-
fectly fine that way. But you also could tap a little 2x button in the lower-
right corner of the iPad screen to make the app fill the entire screen. The 
graphics were much coarser, since iOS 8 was basically just magnifying 
everything.
Today, the 2x button is gone. All iPhone apps automatically fill the screen. 
For the most part, the graphics aren’t as blurry as they once were; Apple 
has found ways to sharpen them up on the iPad screen.
Tip: Ordinarily, the App Store app shows you only apps designed for the 
iPad’s big screen. Which is a shame, because there are hundreds of 
thousands more apps available for the iPhone, which you can run 
on the iPad.
To find them, do a search—and on the search-results page, use the 
top-left pop-up menu to choose iPhone Only.
Organizing Your Apps
As you add new apps to your iPad, it sprouts new Home screens as nec-
essary to accommodate them all, up to a grand total of 11 screens. That’s 
224 icons—and yet you can actually go all the way up to many thousands 
of apps, thanks to the miracle of folders. 
That multiple–Home screen business can get a little unwieldy, but a cou-
ple of tools can help you manage. First, you can just use Siri to open an 
app, without even knowing where it is. Just say, “Open Angry Birds” (or 
whatever). 
Second, the Spotlight search feature can pluck the program you want out 
of your haystack, as described on page 81.
Third, you can organize your apps into folders, which greatly alleviates the 
agony of TMHSS (Too Many Home Screens Syndrome).

All About Apps
267
It’s worth taking the time to arrange the icons on your Home screens into 
logical categories, tidy folders, or at least a sensible sequence.
You can do that either on the iPad itself or in iTunes on your computer. 
That’s far quicker and easier, but it works only when your iPad is actually 
connected to the Mac or PC. Read on.
Rearranging/Deleting Apps Using iTunes
To fiddle with the layout of your Home screens with the least amount of 
hassle, connect the iPad to your computer using the white charging cable 
or over WiFi. Open iTunes.
Click your iPad’s icon (∏) at top left, and then click Apps in the left-side 
list. You see the display on the next page.
From here, it’s all mouse power:
• For each listed app, click the button so that it says either Install (if the 
app is on your computer but not currently on your iPad) or Remove 
(if it is; at that point, the button changes to say Will Remove). In other 
words, it’s possible to store hundreds of apps in iTunes but load only 
some of them onto your iPad.
• Click one of the Home screen miniatures on the right list to indicate 
which screen you want to edit. It gets big. Now you can drag the app 
icons to rearrange them on that page. (Click the background to close 
the life-size image.)
• Beneath the Home screen miniatures, iTunes displays similar mockups 
of each folder on your iPad. Because they’re visible here, all of them, 
all the time, it’s very easy to put icons into them—and to work with 
the multiple “pages” within each folder (read on).
• It’s fine to drag an app onto a different page mockup. You can orga-
nize your icons on these Home screens by category, frequency of use, 
color, or whatever tickles your fancy. (The + button above each pile of 
mockups means “Click to install an additional Home screen.”)
Tip: You can select several app icons simultaneously by c-clicking them 
(or Ctrl-clicking in Windows); that way, you can move a bunch of 
them at once.
• You can drag the page mockups around to rearrange them, too.
• To delete an app from the iPad, point to its icon and click the X. (You 
can’t delete Apple’s starter apps like Safari and Mail.)

Chapter 9
268
• Create a folder by dragging one app’s icon on top of another (see 
page 270 for more on folders).
When your design spurt is complete, click Apply in the lower-right corner 
of the screen.
Rearranging/Deleting Apps Right on the iPad
You can also redesign your Home screens right on the iPad, which is handy 
when you don’t happen to be wired up to a computer.
To enter this Home screen editing mode, hold your finger down on any 
icon until, after about a second, the icons begin to—what’s the correct 
term?—wiggle. 
Tip: You can even move an icon onto the Dock. Just make room for it by 
first dragging an existing Dock icon to another spot on the screen.
At this point, you can rearrange your icons by dragging them around the 
glass into a new order; other icons scoot aside to make room.
Tip: You can drag a single icon across multiple Home screens without 
ever having to lift your finger. Just drag the icon against the right or 
left margin of the screen to “turn the page.”

All About Apps
269
To create an additional Home screen, drag a wiggling icon to the right 
edge of the screen; keep your finger down. The first Home screen slides 
off to the left, leaving you on a new, blank one, where you can deposit the 
icon. You can create up to 11 Home screens in this way. 
You may have noticed that, while your icons are wiggling, most of them 
also sprout little —’s. That’s how you delete a program you don’t need 
anymore: Tap that —. You’ll be asked if you’re sure; if so, it says bye-bye.
(You can’t delete one of Apple’s preinstalled apps, so no — appears on 
those icons. If they really bug you, you can drag the little-used Apple apps 
into a folder somewhere.)
When everything looks good, press the Home button to exit Edit mode 
and stop the wiggling.
Restoring the Home Screen
If you ever need to undo all the damage you’ve done, tap SettingsÆGeneralÆ​ 
ResetÆReset Home Screen Layout. That function preserves any new pro-
grams you’ve installed, but it consolidates them. If you’d put 10 programs 
on each of four Home screens, you wind up with only two screens, each 
packed with 20 icons. Any leftover blank pages are eliminated. This func-
tion also places all your downloaded apps in alphabetical order.

Chapter 9

Folders
Folders are so useful on your Mac or PC—so why not use them on your 
iPad? Folders let you organize your apps, de-emphasize the ones you 
don’t use often, and restore order to that dizzying display of icons.
These days, each folder can have many pages of its own, each displaying 
nine icons. A single folder, in other words, can contain as many apps as 
you want—and therefore, only memory limits how many apps you can fit 
onto your iPad.
Setting Up Folders on the iPad
To create and edit folders, begin by entering Home screen editing mode. 
That is, hold your finger down on any icon until all the icons begin to wiggle.
Now, to create a folder, drag one app’s icon on top of another. The soft-
ware puts both of them into a new folder and proposes a name, which you 
can change at this point. If they’re the same kind of app, iOS even tries to 
figure out what category they both belong to—and names the new folder 
accordingly (“Music,” “Photos,” “Kid Games,” or whatever).
Drag one app onto another…
…and a new folder is born. Rename it here.

All About Apps
271
You’re welcome to add more apps to this folder. Tap the Home screen 
background to close the folder, and then (while the icons are still wiggling) 
drag another app onto the folder’s icon. Lather, rinse, repeat.
If one of your folders has more than nine apps in it, then iOS creates a sec-
ond “page” for the folder—and a third, a fourth, and so on. You can move 
apps around within the pages and otherwise master your new multipage 
folder domain.
You can scroll the folder “pages” by swiping sideways, just as you scroll the 
full-size Home pages. The only limit to how many icons a folder can hold is 
your tolerance for absurdity.
Once you’ve created a folder or two, they’re easy to rename, move, delete, 
and so on. (Again, you can do all of the following only in icon-wiggling 
editing mode.) Like this:
• Take an app out of a folder by dragging its icon anywhere else on the 
Home screen. The other icons scoot aside to make room, just as they 
do when you move them from one Home screen to another.
• Move a folder around by dragging, as you would any other icon.
Tip: You can drag a folder icon onto the Dock, too, just as you would any 
app. Now you’ve got a pop-up subfolder full of your favorite apps—
on the Dock, which is present on every Home screen. That’s a very 
useful feature; it multiplies the handiness of the Dock itself.
• Rename a folder by opening it (tapping it). At this point, the folder’s 
name box is ready for editing.
• Move an icon from one folder “page” to another by dragging it to 
the edge of the folder, waiting with your finger down until the page 
“changes,” and then releasing your finger in the right spot.
• Delete a folder by removing all of its contents. The folder disappears 
automatically.
When you’re finished manipulating your folders, press the Home button to 
exit Home screen editing mode—and stop all the wiggling madness.
Setting Up Folders in iTunes
It’s faster and easier to set up your folders within iTunes, on your Mac or 
PC, where you have a mouse and a big screen to help you. Connect your 
iPad to your computer (by cable or WiFi), open iTunes, click the iPad’s icon 
at top left, and then click the Apps tab in the left-side column. You see 
something like the illustration on page 268.

Chapter 9
272
To create a folder, click a Home page miniature to expand it; now drag one 
app’s icon on top of another, exactly as you’d do on the iPad. The software 
puts both of them into a single new folder. As on the iPad, the computer 
proposes a folder name; an editing bar also appears so that you can type 
a custom name you prefer.
Once you’ve got a folder, you can open it just by double-clicking. It expands 
to life size, revealing its contents. Now you can edit the folder’s name, drag 
the icons around inside it, or drag an app right out of the folder window 
and onto another Home page (or another folder on it). Just keep your fin-
ger down on the mouse button or trackpad, no matter how long it takes, 
until the new Home page or folder page opens.
Below the Home pages, you’ll discover that each of your app folders now 
has an app-management screen mockup of its own, complete with a hori-
zontally scrolling set of pages. That’s so you can move the “pages” around, 
organize the apps within them, and so on.
If you remove all the apps from a folder, the folder disappears.
App Preferences
If you’re wondering where you can change an iPad app’s settings, consider 
backing out to the Home screen and then tapping Settings. Apple encour-
ages programmers to add their programs’ settings here, way down below 
the bottom of the iPad’s own Settings screen.
Some programmers ignore the advice and build the settings right into 
their apps, where they’re a little easier to find. But if you don’t see them 
there, now you know where else to look.
App Updates
When a circled number (like @) appears on the App Store’s icon on the 
Home screen, or on the Updates icon within the App Store program, that’s 
Apple’s way of letting you know that a program you already own has been 
updated. Apple knows which programs you’ve bought—and notifies you 
when new, improved versions are released. Which is remarkably often; 
software companies constantly fix bugs and add new features.
Manual Updates
When you tap Updates, you’re shown a list of the programs with waiting 
updates. A tiny What’s New arrow lets you know what the changes are—
new features, perhaps, or some bug fixes. And when you tap a program’s 

All About Apps
273
name, you go to its details screen, where you can remind yourself of what 
the app does and where you can read other people’s reviews of this new 
version.
You can download one app’s update, or, with a tap on the Update All but-
ton, all of them…no charge.
Note: You can also download your updates from iTunes. Click Apps in 
the Source list (under the Library heading); the lower edge of 
the window lets you know if there are updated versions of your 
programs waiting and offers buttons that let you download the 
updates individually or all at once.
Automatic Updates
If you have a lot of apps, you may come to feel as though you’re spend-
ing your whole life downloading updates. They descend like locusts, every 
single day, demanding your attention.
That’s why Apple offers an automatic update-downloading option. Your 
iPad can download and install updated versions of your apps quietly and 
automatically in the background. 
To turn on this feature, open SettingsÆiTunes & App Store. Under 
Automatic Downloads, turn on Updates. (If you’d prefer that your cellu-
lar iPad wait to do this downloading until it’s in a WiFi hotspot—to avoid 
eating up your monthly cellular data-plan allotment—then turn off Use 
Cellular Data.)
From now on, the task of manually approving each app’s update is off 
your to-do list forever. Only a blue dot next to an app’s name on the Home 
screen lets you know that it’s been updated.
Tip: Fortunately, the iPad also keeps a tidy record of every app it’s 
updated and what that update gives you. Open the App Store app; 
tap the Updates tab. There’s your list, sorted chronologically. Tap 
an app’s row to read what was new in the update you’ve already 
received. 
How to Find Good Apps
If the Featured, What’s Hot, and Charts lists in the App Store app aren’t 
getting you inspired, there are all kinds of Web sites dedicated to reviewing 
and recommending iPad apps. (Do a Google search for best iPad apps.)

Chapter 9
274
But if you’ve never dug into iPad apps before, then you should at least try 
out some of the superstars, the big dogs that almost everybody has.
Many of the most popular apps are designed to deliver certain Web sites 
in the best-looking way possible. That’s why there are apps for Facebook, 
Twitter, LinkedIn, Spotify, Pandora, Flickr, Yelp, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, 
Wikipedia, and so on.
Here are a very few more examples—a drop in the bucket at the tip of the 
iceberg—of the infinite app variety beyond those basics:
• Google Maps (free). Google Maps is a replacement for the built-in 
Maps app. It’s much, much better than the built-in Maps program—
even Apple has admitted that. Among other things, it offers Street 
View (you can actually see a photo of almost any address and “look 
around” you), it incorporates the Zagat guides for restaurants, and it’s 
unbelievably smart about knowing what you’re trying to type into the 
search box. Usually, about three letters is all you need to type before 
the app guesses what you mean.
• Google Mobile (free). Speak to search Google’s maps. Includes 
Google Goggles: Point the iPad’s camera at a book, DVD, wine bottle, 
logo, painting, landmark, or bit of text, and the hyper-intelligent app 
recognizes it and displays information about it from the Web.

• Echofon (free). Most free Twitter apps are a bit on the baffling side. 
This one is simple and clean. 
• Instagram (free) has a bunch of filter effects, as iOS’s Camera app 
does. But the real magic is in the way it’s designed to share your pho-
tos. You sign up to receive Instagrams from Facebook or Twitter folk. 
They (the photos, not the folk) show up right in the app, scrolling up 
like a photographic Twitter feed. Seeing what other people are doing 
every day with their cameras and creative urges is really inspirational. 
Other essentials: Angry Birds and its sequel, Bad Piggies. Skype. Hipmunk 
(finds flights). The New York Times. The Amazon Kindle book reader, B&N 
eReader. Dictionary. TED. Mint.com. Scrabble. Keynote Remote (controls 
your Keynote presentations from the iPad). Remote (yes, another one, also 
from Apple—turns the iPad into a WiFi, whole-house remote control for 
your Mac or PC’s music playback—and for Apple TV). Instant-messaging 
(AIM, Yahoo Messenger, IM+, or Beejive IM). Yahoo Weather (gorgeous).
Happy apping!
The App Switcher
Often, it’s handy to switch among open apps. Maybe you want to copy 
something from Safari (on the Web) into Mail (a message you’re writing).
 Maybe you want to refer to your frequent flyer number (in Notes) as 
you’re using an airline’s check-in app. Maybe you want to adjust something 
in Settings and then get back to whatever you were doing.
The key to switching apps is this: Double-press the Home button. Whatever 
is on the screen gets replaced by the app switcher.
You see a horizontally scrolling row of icons, representing the open apps. 
Above them, you see shrunken-down images of their screens (next page). 
You can actually see what’s going on in each open app. In fact, sometimes, 
that’s all you need; you can refer to another app’s screen in this view, with-
out actually having to switch into that app.
When you scroll horizontally to look through your recently opened apps 
(they’re in chronological order), you may notice that the icons and their 
screens seem to scroll at different speeds. They’re moving so that the icon 
is always centered under its much larger screen.

Chapter 9
276
TIP: Thoughtfully enough, the app switcher always puts the previous 
app front and center when you first double-press the Home button. 
For example, if you’re in Safari but you were using Mail a minute ago, 
Mail appears centered in the app switcher. That makes life easier if 
you’re doing a lot of jumping back and forth between two apps; one 
tap takes you into the previous app.
When you tap an app’s icon or screen in the app switcher, you open that 
app.
Force Quitting an App
The app switcher lets you manually exit an app, closing it down. To do that, 
flick the unwanted app’s mini-screen upward, so that it flies up off the top 
of the screen.
(The app is not really gone; it will return to the lineup the next time you 
open it from the Home screen.)
You’ll need this gesture only rarely. You’re not supposed to quit every app 
when you’re finished. Force-quit an app only if it’s frozen or acting glitchy 
and needs to be restarted.

All About Apps
277
Your Favorite People
In iOS 8, the app switcher gained a new feature: a row of people icons at 
the top. These are the people you’ve contacted most recently. It’s sort of 
a master speed-dial list that’s always available, no matter what app you’re 
using—ready for quick messaging or FaceTiming.
The idea is to let you reach these people quickly and efficiently, without 
having to burrow through your Contacts, or without having to fire up an 
app (like FaceTime or Messages) and interrupt what you’re doing.
Here’s the procedure:
1.	 Double-press the Home button.
The app switcher screen appears. The icons you see at top are the 
Recents: people you’ve most recently texted or FaceTimed.
2.	 Tap the icon of the person you want to contact.
It expands to show icons for the different ways you’ve set up to con-
tact that person: I message, ‹ FaceTime (video), or C FaceTime 
(audio). (You can scroll these icons horizontally, too.)
3.	 Tap the communication method you prefer.
If you tap I, Messages opens, ready to send a note to that person. 
If you tap ‹, FaceTime opens and initiates a video call. C opens 
FaceTime and initiates an audio call.
The hardest part about this whole feature is just remembering to use it. 
You may be used to opening the app first and then choosing a person; 
using this VIP feature, you tap the person first and then choose the app.

Chapter 9
278
Tip: There may be one more element on the task-switcher screen, too: a 
faint app icon at the far left. That’s a document, email, or Web page 
being sent to your iPad by your Mac, using Handoff (see page 453).
A Word About Background Apps
Switching out of a program doesn’t actually close it. All apps can run in 
the background. 
Of course, if every app ran full-tilt simultaneously, your iPad would guzzle 
down battery power like crazy. To solve that problem, Apple has put two 
kinds of limits in place:
• iOS’s limits. Not all apps run full speed in the background. Apps that 
really need constant updating, like Facebook or Twitter, get refreshed 
every few seconds; apps that don’t rely on constant Internet updates 
get to nap for a while in the background.
In deciding which apps get background attention, iOS studies things 
like how good your iPad’s Internet connection is and what time of day 
you traditionally use a certain app (so that your newspaper’s app is 
ready with the latest articles when you open it).
• Your own limits. You can’t control which apps run in the background, 
but you can control which ones download new data in the back-
ground. In SettingsÆGeneralÆBackground App Refresh, you’ll find 
a list of every app that may want to update itself in the background. 
In an effort to make your battery last longer, you can turn off back-
ground updating for the apps you don’t really care about; you can 
even turn off all background updating using the master switch at the 
top.
The bottom line: There’s no need to quit apps you’re not using, ever. 
Contrary to certain Internet rumors, they generally don’t use enough mem-
ory or battery power to matter. You may see dozens of apps in the app 
switcher, but you’ll never sense that your iPad is bogging down as a result.
AirPrint: Printing from the iPad
The very phrase “printing from the iPad” might seem a little peculiar. How 
do you print from a gadget without any jacks for connecting a printer?
Wirelessly, of course. 

All About Apps
279
You can send printouts from your iPad to any printer that’s connected to 
your Mac or PC on the same WiFi network if you have a piece of software 
like Printopia ($20). 
Or you can use the iPad’s 
built-in 
AirPrint 
technol-
ogy, which can send print-
outs directly to a WiFi printer 
without requiring a Mac or a 
PC.
Not just any WiFi printer, 
though—only those that rec-
ognize AirPrint. Many recent 
Canon, 
Epson, 
HP, 
and 
Lexmark printers work with 
AirPrint; you can see a list of 
them on Apple’s Web site, 
here: 
http://support.apple.
com/kb/HT4356. 
Not all apps can print. Of the 
built-in Apple programs, only 
iBooks, Mail, Photos, Notes, 
and Safari offer Print com-
mands. Those apps contain what most people want to print most of the 
time: PDF documents (iBooks), email messages, driving directions from 
the Web, and so on. Plenty of non-Apple apps work with AirPrint, too.
To use AirPrint, start by tapping the P button; tap Print. You’re offered a 
Select Printer option. Tap it to introduce the iPad to your printer, whose 
name should appear automatically. Now you can adjust the printing 
options (number of copies, page range)—and when you finally tap Print, 
your printout shoots wirelessly to the printer, exactly as though your iPad 
and printer were wired together.
The Share Sheet 
Every app is different, of course. But all of them have certain things in 
common; otherwise, you’d go out of your mind.
One of them is the Share sheet. It’s your headquarters for sending stuff off 
your iPad: to other apps, to phones, to the Internet, to a printer. It’s made 
up of several icon rows, each of which scrolls horizontally. (From top to 

Chapter 9
280
bottom, you could title these rows “What to Share,” “Send by AirDrop,” 
“Send to an App,” and “Act on This Data Directly.”)
The Share sheet pops up whenever you tap the Share button (P) that 
appears in many, many apps: Maps, Photos, Safari, Notes, Voice Memos, 
Contacts, and so on. 
The buttons you see depend on the app; you may see only two options 
here, or you may see a dozen. Starting on page 238, for example, you 
can read descriptions of the icons that appear when you’re sending a 
photo: AirDrop, Message, Mail, Twitter, Facebook, Copy, AirPlay, Print, and 
so on. The options here vary by app.
In iOS 8, moreover, there’s a More button at the end of each row. That’s an 
invitation for other, non-Apple apps to install their own “send to” options 
into the Share sheet. When you tap More, you can see the full list of apps 
that have inserted themselves here. 
Now you can perform these tasks:
•  Hide a sharing option. Flip the switch to make one of the sharing 
options disappear from the Share sheet. (You can’t hide the sharing 
options that Apple considers essential, like Message or Mail.)
• Rearrange the sharing options. Use the handle to move these items 
up or down the list, which affects their left-to-right order on the Share 
sheet.

AirDrop
It’s a headline feature: AirDrop, a way to shoot things from one Apple 
iPad, iPhone, or Mac to another—wirelessly, instantly, easily, encryptedly, 
without requiring names, passwords, or settings-up. It’s much faster than 
emailing or text messaging, since you don’t have to know (or type) the 
other person’s address. It’s available on the iPad 4th Generation and later.
Note: If your Mac is running OS X Yosemite, you can shoot files 
between it and your iPad, too! 
You can transmit pictures and videos from the Photos app, people’s info 
cards from Contacts, directions (or your current location) from Maps, 
pages from Notes, Web addresses from Safari, electronic tickets from 
Passbook, apps you like in the App Store, song and video listings from 
the iTunes app), radio stations (iTunes Radio), and so on. As time goes on, 
more and more non-Apple apps will offer AirDrop, too.
Behind the scenes, AirDrop uses Bluetooth (to find nearby gadgets within 
about 30 feet) and a private, temporary WiFi mini-network (to transfer the 
file). Both sender and receiver must have Bluetooth and WiFi turned on.
The process goes like this:
1.	 Find a willing recipient. You can’t send anything with AirDrop unless 
the receiving iPad or tablet is running iOS 7 or later—and is awake. 
And only recent models work with AirDrop: iPad 5 or later, 4th 
Generation iPad or later, any iPad mini, and 5th Generation iPod Touch 
or later. 
In other words, most AirDrop exchanges begin with your saying, “Hey, 
do you have iOS 7 or 8?”
2.	 Open the item you want to share. Tap the Share button (P). If your 
app doesn’t have a P button, then you can’t use AirDrop.
When the Share sheet appears, within a few seconds, you see some-
thing that would have awed the masses in 1975: small circular photos 
of everyone nearby. (Or at least everyone with iOS 7 or 8, or OS X 
Yosemite. Or at least everyone among them who’s open to receiving 
AirDrop transmissions, as described below.)
TIP: When you send a photo, the top row of the Share sheet shows your 
other photos and videos so that you can select additional items to 
go along for the ride. A blue checkmark identifies each item you’ve 
selected to send.

Chapter 9
282
3.	 Tap the icon of the person you want to share with. In about a sec-
ond, a message appears on the recipient’s screen, conveying your 
offer to transmit something good—and, when it makes sense, show-
ing a picture of it (below, bottom).
TIP: Actually, you can select more than one person’s icon. In that case, 
you’ll send this item to everyone at once. 
At this point, it’s up to your recipients. If they tap Accept, then the 
transfer begins (and ends); whatever you sent them opens up auto-
matically in the relevant app. You’ll know that AirDrop was successful 
because the word “Sent” appears on your screen.

All About Apps
283
If they tap Decline, then you must have misunderstood their willing-
ness to accept your item (or they tapped the wrong button). In that 
case, you’ll see the word “Declined” on your screen.
The One AirDrop Setting
Your existence probably won’t become a living hell of AirDrop invitations. 
Realistically, you won’t be bombarded by strangers around you who want 
to show you family pictures or Web links. Even so, Apple has given you 
some control over who’s allowed to try to send you things by AirDrop.
To see the settings, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the 
Control Center. There, in the middle, is the AirDrop button. Tap it to see 
these three choices:
• Off. Nobody can send anything to you by AirDrop. You’ll never be 
disturbed by an incoming “Accept?” message.
• Contacts Only. Only people in your Contacts app—your own address 
book—can send you things by AirDrop. Your iPad is invisible to 
strangers. (Of course, even when someone you know tries to send 
something, you still have to approve the transfer.)
Note: The Contacts Only option requires that both you and your 
recipient have iCloud accounts and are logged in. Your Contacts 
card for the other person has to include that iCloud address (or 
.me or .mac). 
• Everyone. Anyone, even strangers, can try to send you things. You 
can still accept or decline each transfer.
Tip: OK, there’s one other AirDrop setting to fiddle with: In SettingsÆ​
Sounds, you can specify the sound effect that means, “AirDrop file 
received.”
(OK, OK, there’s one more setting. Deep in GeneralÆRestrictions, 
you can turn off AirDrop altogether. Now your youngster—or 
whomever you’re trying to restrict with restrictions—can’t get into 
trouble in a debauched frenzy of sending and receiving files.)
iCloud Drive
iCloud Drive, new in iOS 8, is Apple’s version of Dropbox. It’s a folder 
whose contents appear identically on every Mac, iPhone, iPad, and even 
Windows PC you own, through the magic of instant online syncing. It’s an 
online “disk” that holds 5 gigabytes (more, if you’re willing to pay for it).

Chapter 9
284
The iCloud Drive is a perfect place to put stuff you want to be able to 
access from any computer, iPad, or iPhone, wherever you go. It’s a great 
backup, too, because anything you put into it is automatically duplicated 
on multiple machines.
Your first chance to turn on iCloud Drive was when you first installed iOS 8 
(or bought your iOS 8 iPad). If you declined, maybe because you had no 
idea what it was about, then you can visit SettingsÆiCloudÆiCloud Drive 
and turn iCloud Drive on now.
Note: iCloud Drive replaces a previous syncing feature that Apple called 
“Documents in the Cloud.” If you turn on iCloud Drive, the old 
system goes away; all the files you kept there are brought onto 
your new iCloud Drive. That’s fine, as long as you understand that 
non–iOS 8 (or OS X Yosemite) gadgets will no longer be able to 
see them.
Once you turn on iCloud Drive, you can’t go back to the 
“Documents in the Cloud” system. Sure, you can turn off iCloud 
Drive (in Settings), but all that does is stop syncing the drive’s 
contents with your other machines.
Now, it’s easy to understand iCloud Drive on a Mac or PC. It looks like any 
other disk, full of files and folders. You can even access them at iCloud.
com (click the Drive icon), which is handy when you have to use someone 
else’s computer. Any change you make to the iCloud Drive or its contents 
is instantly synchronized across all your other gadgets.
But on the iPad, there is no traditional desktop. There are no disk icons. So 
where’s the iCloud Drive?
On the iPad, you can see what’s on your iCloud Drive only within apps 
that can open and save documents. That includes Apple’s apps—Keynote, 
Pages, Numbers, iMovie—and other apps that create and open docu-
ments, like, say, Scanner Pro and PDF Expert. Over time, more companies 
will make their apps compatible with iCloud Drive.
In all these apps, there’s an Open button or icon that presents the iCloud 
Drive’s contents. In Pages, for example, when you’re viewing your list of 
documents, tap n, and then tap iCloud. There’s the list of folders on your 
iCloud Drive, corresponding perfectly to what you would have seen on a 
Mac or a PC. Tap a folder to open it and see what’s in it. 
Note that iOS shows you everything on your iCloud Drive, even things you 
can’t open at the moment. For example, if you’re using the iMovie app, you 
can’t open a Pages file, so Pages documents appear dimmed and gray.

All About Apps
285
On the other hand, this arrangement offers some really useful perks:
• You can open some kinds of files in different apps. A PDF file, for 
example, can open into Pages, or Photos, or iBooks. So PDF files 
show up as openable in all those apps. 
• When you delete an app, you no longer lose all the documents you 
created with it.
You can view your iCloud Drive folders either as icons or in a list view. 
Tap to open one; tap ” at top left to back out of whatever folder you’ve 
opened.
On an iPad, the iCloud Drive folder list is not quite the same thing as hav-
ing a real desktop—you can’t rename, copy, or delete files or folders on the 
iPad, for example. 

Chapter 9
286
But it’s comforting to know that everything on your iCloud Drive that you 
can open is available wherever you go—and that you can now load up 
everyday documents (pictures, music, PDF files, Microsoft Office files, 
iWork documents) onto your iPad by dragging them into the iCloud Drive 
folder on your computer.
Note: Your free iCloud account includes only 5 gigabytes of storage—
and that’s for everything on your iCloud Drive. If you’re willing to 
pay $1 to $20 a month, you can expand that storage to anywhere 
from 20 gigabytes to 1 terabyte. To do that, open SettingsÆ​
iCloudÆ​StorageÆChange Storage Plan.

our Home screen comes already loaded with the icons of about 
25 programs. These are the essentials; eventually, of course, 
you’ll fill that Home screen with apps you install yourself. The 
starter apps include gateways to the Internet (Safari), communications 
tools (Messages, Mail, Contacts), visual records of your life (Photos, 
Camera), shopping centers (iTunes Store, App Store), and entertainment 
(Music, Videos, Podcasts). 
Those core apps get special treatment in the other chapters. This chap-
ter covers the secondary programs, in alphabetical order: Calendar, 
Clock, Compass, Game Center, Health, iBooks, Maps, Newsstand, Notes, 
Passbook, Podcasts, Reminders, Stocks, Tips, Voice Memos, and Weather.
Note: No, the iPad does not come with a Calculator app, even though 
the iPhone does. Weird. Of course, there are thousands of free 
calculator apps waiting for you in the App Store.
Calendar
What kind of digital companion would the iPad be if it didn’t have a cal-
endar program? And not only does it have a calendar—it syncs. If you 
maintain your life’s schedule on a Mac (in Calendar or Entourage) or a PC 
(in Outlook), then you already have your calendar on your iPad. Make a 
change in one place, and it changes in the other, every time you sync over 
the USB cable.
Better yet, if you have an iCloud account or work for a company with an 
Exchange server (Chapters 15 and 16), then your calendar can be synchro-
nized with your computer automatically, wirelessly, over the air. 
Or you can use Calendar all by itself.

Chapter 10

Tip: The Calendar icon on the Home screen shows what looks like one of 
those paper Page-a-Day calendar pads. But if you look closely, you’ll 
see a sweet touch: It actually shows today’s day and date.
The Four Views
When you open Calendar, you’re shown today’s schedule on the left half of 
the screen, broken down by time slot. 
Across the top, you see buttons for the Calendar’s four views: Day, Week, 
Month, and Year. They work pretty much alike, even if you rotate the iPad.

The Built-In Apps
289
• Day view. Swipe horizontally across the Day column to see the pre-
vious or next day. Tap a date at the top to see another day this week. 
Swipe across the dates at the top to jump to another week.
• Week view is the multicolumn layout shown on the facing page. You 
can swipe sideways to move to earlier or later dates. Swipe up or 
down to move through the hours of the day.
• Month view, of course, shows the entire month at a glance. You can 
scroll the month vertically, thereby scanning the entire year in a few 
seconds.
• Year view is a simple, vertically scrolling map of the year’s months. 
Tap a month block to open it back into Month view.
TIP: In all three views—Day, Month, Year—you can tap Today (bottom 
left) to return to today’s date.
Making an Appointment
The basic calendar is easy to figure out. After all, with the exception of one 
unfortunate Gregorian incident, we’ve been using calendars successfully 
for centuries. 
Even so, recording an event on this calendar is quite a bit more flexible than 
entering one on, say, one of those “Hunks of the Midwest Police Stations” 
paper calendars. 
To begin, summon the New Event panel like this:
• Day View, Week View. In these views, hold your finger down on a 
time slot to add a new, 1-hour appointment right there.
• Month View. Hold your finger down on the appropriate Month view 
square.
• Year View. Tap n in the top-right corner of the screen. (This button 
actually works in all views, but it requires more steps because you 
have to specify the date and time manually.)
In each case, the New Event panel pops up, filled with tappable lines of 
information. Tap one (like Starts/Ends or Repeat) to open a configuration 
screen for that element. 

Chapter 10
290
For example:
• Title/Location. Name your appointment here. For example, you might 
type Fly to Phoenix. 
The second line, called Location, makes a lot of sense. If you think 
about it, almost everyone needs to record where a meeting is to take 
place. You might type a reminder for yourself like My place, a specific 
address like 212 East 23rd, a contact phone number, or a flight num-
ber.
Use the keyboard as usual. 
• Starts/Ends. On this screen, 
tap Starts, and then indicate 
the starting time for this 
appointment, using the four 
spinning dials at the bottom of 
the screen. The first sets the 
date; the second, the hour; the 
third, the minute; the fourth, 
AM or PM. If only real alarm 
clocks were so much fun!

The Built-In Apps
291
Then tap Ends and repeat the process to schedule the ending time. 
(The iPad helpfully presets the Ends time to one hour later.) 
An All-day event, of course, has no specific time of day: a holiday, a 
birthday, a book deadline. When you turn this option on, the Starts 
and Ends times disappear. The event appears at the top of the list for 
that day.
Tip: Calendar can handle multiday appointments, too, like trips away. 
Turn on All-day—and then use the Starts and Ends controls to 
specify beginning and ending dates. On the iPad, you’ll see it as a 
list item that repeats on every day’s square. Back on your computer, 
you’ll see it as a banner stretching across the Month view.
• Repeat. (Scroll the New Event pane upward if you don’t see Repeat 
and the other options.)
Here you get common options for recurring events: every day, every 
week, and so on. It starts out saying Never.
Once you’ve tapped a selection, you return to the New Event screen. 
Now you can tap End Repeat to specify when this event should stop 
repeating. If you leave the setting at Never, then you’re stuck seeing 
this event repeating on your calendar until the end of time (a good 
choice for recording, say, your anniversary, especially if your spouse 
might be consulting the same calendar). 
In other situations, you may prefer to tap On Date and spin the three 
dials (month, day, year) to specify an ending date, which is useful for 
car and mortgage payments. 
Tap New Event to return to the editing screen.
• Travel Time. If you turn on this switch, you can indicate how long it’ll 
take you to get to this appointment.
You get six canned choices, from 5 minutes to 2 hours. If you choose 
one, two things happen. First, the travel time is blocked off on your 
calendar, so you don’t accidentally schedule things during your 
driving time. (The travel time is depicted as a dotted extension of the 
appointment.)
Second, if you’ve set up an alarm reminder, it will go off that much 
earlier, so you have time to get where you’re going.
• Calendar. Tap here to specify which color-coded calendar (A cate-
gory, like Home, Kids, or Work) this appointment belongs to. Turn to 
page 294 for details on the calendar concept. 

Chapter 10
292
• Invitees. If you have an iCloud, Exchange, or CalDAV account, you 
can invite people to an event—a meeting, a party, whatever—and 
track their responses, right there on your iPad (or any iCloud gadget). 
When you tap Invitees, you get an Add Invitees screen, where you 
can type in the email addresses of your lucky guests. (Or tap ≠ to 
choose them from your Contacts list.)
Later, when you tap Done, the iPad fires off email invitations to those 
guests. It contains buttons for them to click: Accept, Decline, and 
Maybe. You get to see their responses right here in the details of your 
calendar event. 
As icing on the cake, your guests will see pop-up reminders on their 
phones when the time comes for the party to get started.
• Alert. This screen tells Calendar how to notify you when a certain 
appointment is about to begin. Calendar can send any of four kinds 
of flags to get your attention. Tap how much notice you want: 5, 15, or 
30 minutes before the big moment (or before the travel time you’ve 
specified); an hour or two before; a day or two before; a week before; 
or on the day of the event. 
Note: For all-day events like birthdays, you get a smaller but very useful 
list of choices: “On day of event (9 AM),” “1 day before (9 AM),” 
“2 days before (9 AM),” and “1 week before.”
When you return to the New Event panel, you see that a new line, 
called Second Alert, has sprouted up beneath the first Alert line. This 
line lets you schedule a second warning for your appointment, which 
can occur either before or after the first one. Think of it as a backup 
alarm for events of extra urgency.
Once you’ve scheduled these alerts, you’ll see a message appear on 
the screen at the appointed time(s). (Even if the iPad was asleep, it 
appears briefly.) You’ll also hear a chirpy alarm sound. 
Tip: The iPad doesn’t play the sound if you turned off Calendar Alerts in 
SettingsÆSounds. It also doesn’t play if your iPad has a mute switch 
and you’ve turned it on.
• URL. Here you can record the Web address of some online site that 
provides more information about this event.
• Notes. Here’s your chance to customize your calendar event. You can 
type any text you want in the Notes area—driving directions, contact 
phone numbers, a call history, or whatever.

The Built-In Apps
293
When you’ve completed filling in all these blanks, tap Add. Your newly 
scheduled event now shows up on the calendar. 
Editing, Rescheduling, Deleting Events (Long Way)
To examine the details of an appointment in the calendar, tap it once. An 
Info bubble appears, filled with the essentials of the details you previously 
established. (In Day view, the right half of the screen shows all of that 
information.)
If you tap Edit, you return to what looks like a clone of the Add Event 
screen. Here you can change the name, time, alarm, or any other detail of 
the event, just the way you set them up to begin with.
This time, there’s a red Delete Event button at the very bottom. That’s the 
only way to erase an appointment from your calendar. (You can’t edit or 
erase events created by other people—Facebook birthdays, meetings on 
shared calendars, and so on—only appointments you created.)
Editing and Rescheduling Events (Fun Way)
In Day or Week views, you can drag an appointment’s block to another 
time slot or even another day. Just hold your finger down on the appoint-
ment’s bubble for about a second—until it darkens—before you start to 
drag. It’s a lot quicker and more fluid than having to edit in a dialog box.

Chapter 10
294
You can also change the duration of an appointment in Day and Week 
views. Hold your finger down on its colored block for about a second; 
when you let go, small, round handles appear.
You can drag those tiny handles up or down to make the block taller or 
shorter, in effect making it start or end at a different time. 
Whether you drag the whole block, the top edge, or the bottom edge, the 
iPad thoughtfully displays “:15,” “:30,” or “:45” on the left-side time ruler to 
let you know where you’ll be when you let go.
The Calendar (Category) Concept
A calendar, in Apple’s somewhat confusing terminology, is a color-coded 
subset—a category—into which you can place various appointments. They 
can be anything you like. One person might have calendars called Home, 
Work, and TV Reminders. Another might have Me, Spouse ’n’ Me, and The 
Kidz. A small business could have categories called Deductible Travel, 
R&D, and R&R. 
You can create and edit calendar categories right on the iPad, in your 
desktop calendar program, or (if you’re an iCloud member) at www.icloud.
com when you’re at your computer; all your categories and color-codings 
show up on the iPad automatically. 
At any time, on the iPad, you can choose which subset of categories you 
want to see. Just tap Calendars at the bottom of any view. You open up 
the color-coded list of your categories (facing page, left). As you can 
see, it’s subdivided according to your accounts: your Gmail categories, 
your Yahoo categories, your iCloud categories, and so on. There’s even 
a Facebook option, if you’ve set up your Facebook account, so that you 
can see your Facebook calendar entries and friends’ birthdays right on the 
main calendar.

The Built-In Apps
295
This screen exists partly as a reference, a cheat sheet to help you remem-
ber what color goes with which category, and partly as a tappable sub-
set chooser. That is, you can tap a category’s name to hide or show all of 
its appointments on the calendar. A checkmark means you’re seeing its 
appointments. (The All [Account Name] button turns on or off all of that 
account’s categories at once.)
If you tap Edit, then a little > appears next to each calendar’s name. When 
you tap it, you’re offered a screen where you can change the calendar’s 
name, color, and list of people who can see it—or scroll all the way down 
to see the Delete Calendar button.
The Edit Calendars panel also offers an Add Calendar button. It’s the key 
to creating, naming, and colorizing a new calendar on the iPad. (Whatever 
changes you make to your calendar categories on the iPad will be synced 
back to your Mac or PC.)
Tip: You can set up real-time, wireless connections to calendars 
published on the Web in the CalDAV format—notably your Yahoo 
or Google calendar. Just tap your way to SettingsÆMail, Contacts, 
CalendarsÆAdd Account. Here you can tap iCloud, Exchange, 
Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, or Outlook.com to set up your account. (You 
can also tap OtherÆAdd CalDAV Account to fill in the details of a 
less well-known calendar server.)

Chapter 10
296
Now you have a two-way synced calendar between your iPad and (in 
this case) your online calendar. To read about other ways of syncing the 
iPad with online calendars, including read-only .ics files (like sports-team 
schedules), download the PDF appendix called “Syncing Calendar with 
.ics Files” from this book’s “Missing CD” page (which you’ll find at www.
missingmanuals.com).
Tip: You can share an iCloud calendar with other iCloud members 
(previous page, right), which is fantastic for families and small 
businesses who need to coordinate. Tap Calendars, tap Edit, and 
then tap the calendar to share. Tap Add Person and enter the 
person’s name. Your invitees get invitations by email; with one click, 
they’ve added your appointments to their calendars. They can make 
changes, too.
You can also share a calendar with anyone (not just iCloud 
members) in a “Look, don’t touch” condition. Tap Calendars, tap 
Edit, and then tap the calendar to share. Turn on Public Calendar; 
tap Share Link to open the Share sheet for sending the link. Most 
calendar apps understand the calendar link that your iPad sends.
Search
If you tap Â and type into the search box, you pare down a list of all events 
from all time; only events whose names match what you’ve typed show 
up. Tap one to jump to its block on the main calendar.
Next time you’re sure you made an appointment with Harvey but you can’t 
remember the date, keep this search feature in mind.
Tip: The iOS calendar is basic. For more features and power, consider 
calendar apps like Fantastical or Tempo.
Clock
It’s not just a clock—it’s more like a time factory. Hiding behind this single 
icon on the Home screen are four programs: a world clock, an alarm clock, 
a stopwatch, and a countdown timer. 
Tip: The app icon itself is an accurate clock. It shows the time! Isn’t that 
cute?
World Clock
When you tap World Clock on the Clock screen, you see the current time 
in several world cities—including Apple’s own Cupertino, California. The 

The Built-In Apps
297
color of the clock indicates whether it’s daytime (white) or night (black). 
A handsome world map below shows the geographic locations of these 
cities within their time zones.
The result looks like the row of clocks in a hotel lobby, making you seem 
Swiss and precise.
By checking these clocks, you can avoid calling somebody up at what 
turns out to be 3 a.m.
To specify which city’s time appears on the clock, tap Add. Scroll to the 
city you want, or tap its first letter in the index at the right side to save 
scrolling, or tap in the search box at the top and type the name of a major 
city. As you type, matching city names appear; tap the one whose time 
you want to track. 
As soon as you tap a city name, you return to the World Clock display, 
where that city’s clock joins the others.
Tip: Tap a clock to make it larger, filling the screen, so you can see it from 
across the street.
You can scroll the list of clocks. You’re not limited to six, although only that 
many fit on the screen at once.

Chapter 10
298
Tip: Only the world’s major cities are in the iPad’s database. If you’re 
trying to track the time in Squirrel Cheeks, New Mexico, add a major 
city in the same time zone instead—like Albuquerque.
To edit the list of clocks, tap Edit. Delete a city clock by tapping – and 
then Delete, or drag clocks up or down using the H as a handle. Then tap 
elsewhere on the screen to close the panel.
Alarm
If you travel much, this feature could turn out to be one of your iPad’s most 
useful functions. It’s reliable, it’s programmable, it lets you set up multiple 
re-usable alarms (say, a 6:30 a.m. alarm for weekdays and an 11:30 a.m. 
alarm for weekends), and it even wakes the iPad first, if necessary, to wake 
you.
To set an alarm, tap Alarm at the bottom of the Clock screen. On a map of 
the week, you see the alarms you’ve already created, even if none are cur-
rently set to go off (below). At the top of the screen, in huge numbers, you 
see the next scheduled alarm—again, even if it’s currently turned off. (Use 
the switch to the right to turn it on and off.)
To create a new alarm, tap n to open the Add Alarm panel.

The Built-In Apps
299
Tip: But really, you should not bother setting alarms using this manual 
technique. Instead, you’ll save a lot of time and steps by using Siri. 
Just say, “Set my alarm for 7:30 a.m.” (or whatever time you want).
You have several options here:
• Time dials. Spin these three vertical wheels—hour, minute, AM/PM—to 
specify the time you want the alarm to go off.
• Repeat. Tap to specify what days this alarm rings. You can specify, for 
example, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays by tapping those three 
buttons. (Tap a day-of-the-week button again to turn off its check-
mark.) Tap Back when you’re done. (If you choose Saturdays and 
Sundays, iOS is smart enough to call that “Weekends.”)
• Label. Tap to give this alarm a description, like “Get dressed for wed-
ding.” That message appears on the screen when the alarm goes off.
• Sound. Choose what sound you want to ring. You can choose from 
any of the iPad’s ringtone sounds, any you’ve added yourself—or, best 
of all, Pick a Song. That’s right—you can wake to the music of your 
choice.
• Snooze. If this option is on, then at the appointed time the alarm 
message on the screen offers you a tap to snooze button. Tap it for 10 
more minutes of sleep, at which point the iPad tries again to get your 
attention. (It gives you a countdown in the meantime.)
When you finally tap Save, you return to the Alarm screen, which lists your 
new alarm. Just tap the on/off switch to cancel an alarm. It stays in the list, 
though, so you can quickly reactivate it another day. You can tap n to set 
another alarm, if you like. 
Now the Å icon appears in the status bar at the top of the iPad screen. 
That’s your indicator that the alarm is set.
To delete or edit an alarm, tap Edit. Tap – and then Delete to get rid of an 
alarm completely, or tap the alarm’s name to return to the setup screen, 
where you can make changes to the time, name, sound, and so on.
So what happens when the alarm goes off? The iPad wakes itself up, if it 
was asleep. A message appears, identifying the alarm and the time. 
And, of course, the sound rings. This alarm is one of the only iPad sounds 
that you’ll hear even if the mute switch is turned on (if your model has 
one). Apple figures that if you’ve gone to the trouble of setting an alarm, 
you probably really want to know about it, even if you forget to turn the 
ringer back on.

Chapter 10
300
In that case, the screen says slide to stop alarm.
To cut the ringing short, tap OK or Snooze, or press the Sleep switch, or 
tap a volume button. After the alarm plays (or you cut it short), its on/off 
switch goes to Off (on the Alarm screen)—unless, of course, you’ve set it 
up to be an auto-repeating alarm.
Stopwatch
You’ve never met a more beautiful stopwatch than this one. Tap Start to 
begin timing something: a runner, a train, a person who’s arguing with you. 
While the digits are flying by, you can tap Lap as often as you like. Each 
time, the list at the bottom identifies how much time elapsed since the 
last time you tapped Lap. It’s a way for you to compare, for example, how 
much time a runner is spending on each lap around a track. 
(The tiny digits at the very top measure the current lap.)
You can work in other apps while the stopwatch is counting. In fact, the 
timer keeps ticking away even when the iPad is asleep! As a result, you 
can time long-term events, like how long it takes an ice sculpture to melt, 
the time it takes for a bean seed to sprout, or the length of a Michael Bay 
movie.
Tap Stop to freeze the counter; tap Start to resume the timing. If you tap 
Reset, you reset the counter to zero and erase all the lap times. 
Timer
The fourth Clock mini-app is a countdown timer. You input a starting time, 
and it counts down to zero.
Countdown timers are everywhere in life. They measure the periods in 
sports and games, cooking times in the kitchen, penalties on The Amazing 
Race. But on the iPad, the timer has an especially handy function: It can 
turn off the music or video after a specified amount of time. In short, it’s a 
sleep timer that plays you to sleep and then shuts off to save power.
To set the timer, open the Clock app and then tap Timer. Spin the two dials 
to specify the number of hours and minutes you want to count down. 
Then tap ! Radar (or whatever it says directly beneath the dials) to choose 
the sound you want the iPad to play when the timer reaches 0:00. The last 
one listed, Stop Playing, is the aforementioned sleep timer. It stops audio 
and video playback at the appointed time, so that you (and the iPad) can 
go to sleep. Tap Set.

The Built-In Apps
301
Finally, tap Start. Big clock digits count down toward zero. While it’s in 
progress, you can do other things on the iPad, change the When Timer 
Ends settings, or just hit Cancel to forget the whole thing.
Tip: It’s much faster and simpler to use Siri to start, pause, and resume 
the Timer. See page 40.
Game Center
The iPad is an accomplished gaming device, the equal of Sony’s PlayStation 
Portable or Nintendo’s DS. iPad features like the accelerometer and touch-
screen are perfect for a multitude of games, from first-person shoot-’em-
ups to casual games that require nothing more complicated than dragging 
a tile across the screen. Game makers have responded to the iPad—on the 
App Store, the Games category is one of the most active sections, with 
thousands of games available.
To help fan the flames of iPad gaming, Apple created Game Center as a 
way for iPadders to compare scores with their friends and to challenge 
buddies to games. 

Chapter 10
302
Getting Started
You have to sign up for Game Center before you can use it, but the pro-
cess is simple: Just enter your Apple ID and password. 
You’ll be asked to create a nickname—“AngriestBird” or “BobSmith2000,” 
for example. On the next screen, you can make this nickname public, so 
that it can appear on the leaderboards (scoreboards that show the high-
est point winners) for iOS games; you can also use this nickname when 
you play multiplayer apps like Super Stickman Golf against other people.
That public profile includes a photo of you; you can grab one from your 
photo library or shoot it from within Game Center itself using the iPad’s 
front-facing camera. You also have space to write a little description of 
yourself, like the bio line in Twitter.
Once all that’s in place, the Me tab in Game Center displays your nickname, 
that clever little phrase you wrote, and your picture (above). Beneath that, 
multicolored spheres display the number of Game Center-compatible 
games you own, the number of Game Center friends you have, and—per-
haps most significantly—the number of points you’ve accrued from your 
gaming activities.

The Built-In Apps
303
Points and Achievements
Points play a leading role in Game Center. They’re what you earn from rack-
ing up achievements in Game Center–compatible apps. Smash enough 
blocks in Angry Birds Seasons, or build a certain number of floors in Tiny 
Tower, and you unlock achievements in those games; those achievements 
translate to points, which show up in your Game Center profile.
Those points also provide a way to measure yourself against your friends. 
On Game Center’s Friends tab, you can tap the name of one of your 
friends. You get a choice of three bubbles: the games your friends play, 
the names of their friends, and the number of points they’ve tallied. That 
points view features a side-by-side comparison showing your respective 
accomplishments in commonly played games, so you can settle once and 
for all who’s tops at Tiny Wings. (Game Center also shows the points your 
friends have racked up in games you don’t own, which is Apple’s way of 
suggesting that maybe you should download more games.)
Making Friends
Of course, before you can compare your scores with your friends, you 
have to have some friends. Tap the n button in the upper-right corner of 
the Friends panel to open the Friend Request page, where you can invite 
someone to be your Game Center buddy using his nickname, Facebook 
account, or email address. (In fact, Game Center thoughtfully offers you a 
list of Facebook contacts who are already on Game Center.) 
But what if you don’t have any existing friends, or at least none that you 
know are on Game Center? Tap Upload My Contacts. The app sends your 
address book to Apple’s master computers, so it can match you up with 
strangers who have the same games you do. Tapping one of those names 
takes you to a page that shows common friends, if any, and a Send Friend 
Request button.
You can also find gaming companions through your other Game Center 
friends. Just tap names in the list of your current friends, and then select 
the Friends view on their pages to see who they hang out with in Game 
Center when they’re not matching scores with you. 
Finding Games
Game Center can also help you find games to play—specifically, games 
that are designed to tie in with Game Center. The Recommended sec-
tion of the Games tab lists suggested games. Game Center bases these 
recommendations on what you already own, what your friends play, and 
popular App Store downloads. Selecting a game in the Recommendations 
list shows you leaderboards, achievements you can unlock, and which of 
your friends are playing the game. You can download the app right from 
this screen.

Chapter 10
304
You can also buy games directly from the list of games your friends play 
within the Friends tab. Tap a game name to see your friends’ rankings, or 
tap the price tag to download the game directly.
Playing Games
All right. Suppose, then, that you’ve downloaded some games (easy) and 
you have some friends (it could happen). You’re ready to play!
Tap the Games tab, tap the game you want, and then tap the player you 
want to challenge.
Or start on the Friends tab. Tap the friend, tap his Games bubble, and then 
tap the game you want. 
Game Center hands you off to the game itself—a different app—so that 
your online adventure can begin. (Usually you’ll see an option for Network 
play or Internet play; that’s the one you want.)
iBooks
iBooks is Apple’s ebook reading program, and one of the iPad’s most nat-
ural and useful apps. With iBooks, you can carry around dozens or hun-
dreds of books on your tablet, without adding an ounce of weight to it.

The Built-In Apps
305
Most people think of iBooks as a reader for books that Apple sells on 
its iTunes bookstore—bestsellers and current fiction, for example—and it 
does that very well. But you can also load it up with your own PDF docu-
ments, as well as thousands of free, older, out-of-copyright books.
Tip: iBooks is very cool and all. But in the interest of fairness, it’s worth 
noting that Amazon’s free Kindle app, and Barnes & Noble’s free 
B&N eReader app, are much the same thing—but offer much bigger 
book libraries at lower prices than Apple’s.
Downloading Books
To shop the iBooks bookstore, open the iBooks app. If this is your first 
time diving in, you might be offered a selection of free starter books to 
download right now. Go for it; they’re real, brand-name books by famous 
authors.

Chapter 10
306
If, at any time, you want to buy another book—it could happen—well, the 
icons across the bottom are the literary equivalent of the App Store. Tap 
Featured to see what Apple is plugging this week; NYTimes to see what’s 
on The New York Times Best Seller list; Top Charts to see what books 
Apple is selling the most of; Top Authors; and Purchased to see what 
you’ve bought.
Tip: Once you’ve bought a book from Apple, you can download it again 
on other iPads, iPod Touches, iPhones, and Macs. Buy once, read 
many times. That’s the purpose of the Not on This iPad tab, which 
appears when you tap Purchased.
Once you find a book that looks good, you can tap Sample to download 
a free chapter, read ratings and reviews, or tap the price itself to buy the 
book and download it straight to the iPad.
PDFs and ePub Files
You can also load up your ebook reader from your computer, feeding it 
with PDF documents and ePub files.
Note: ePub is the normal iBooks format. It’s a very popular standard 
for ebook readers, Apple’s and otherwise. The only difference 
between ePub documents you create and the ones Apple sells is 
that Apple’s are copy protected.

The Built-In Apps
307
As usual, your Mac or PC is the most convenient loading dock for files 
bound for your iPad. If you have a Mac, open the iBooks program. If not, 
open iTunes, click your iPad’s icon at the top (when it’s connected), and 
then click Books. 
Either way, you now see all the books, PDF documents, and ePub files that 
you’ve slated for transfer. To add to this set, just drag files off your desktop 
and directly into this window.
And where are you supposed to get all these files? Well, PDF documents 
are everywhere—people send them as attachments, and you can turn 
any document into a PDF file. (For example, on the Mac, in any program, 
choose FileÆPrint; in the resulting dialog box, click PDFÆSave as PDF.)
Tip: If you get a PDF document as an email attachment, then adding 
it to iBooks is even easier. Tap the attachment to open it; now tap 
Open in iBooks in the corner of the page. (The iPad may not be able 
to open really huge PDFs, though.)
But free ebooks in ePub format are everywhere, too. There are 33,000 
free downloadable books at gutenberg.org, for example, and over a million 
at books.google.com—oldies, but classic oldies, with lots of Mark Twain, 
Agatha Christie, Herman Melville, H.G. Wells, and so on. (Lots of these are 
available in the Free pages of Apple’s own iBook store, too.)
Tip: These freebie books usually come with generic-looking covers. But 
once you’ve dragged them into iTunes, it’s easy to add a good-
looking cover. Use images.google.com to search for the book’s title. 
Right-click (or Control-click) the cover image in your Web browser; 
from the shortcut menu, choose Copy Image. In iTunes, in Library 
mode, choose Books from the top-left pop-up menu. Right-click (or 
Control-click) the generic book; choose Get Info; click Artwork; and 
paste the cover you copied. Now that cover will sync over to the 
iPad along with the book.
Once you’ve got books in iTunes, connect the iPad, choose its name at top 
right, click the Books tab at top, and turn on the checkboxes of the books 
you want to transfer. 
Your Library
Once you’ve supplied your iBooks app with some reading material, the fun 
begins. When you open the app, its My Books tab shows a sleek bookshelf 

Chapter 10
308
with your library represented as little book covers. Mostly what you’ll do 
here is tap a book to open it. But there are other activities waiting for you:
• 	Tap Ç, which switches the book-cover view to a more boring (but 
more compact) list view. Buttons at the top let you sort the list by 
author, title, category, and so on.
• 	Tap Select if you want to delete a book, or a bunch of them. To do 
that, tap each book thumbnail that you want to target for termination; 
observe how they sprout C marks. Then tap Delete. Of course, delet-
ing a book from the iPad doesn’t delete your copy in iTunes or online.
• 	You can reorganize your bookshelf. Hold down your finger on a book 
until it swells with pride, and then drag it into a new spot. (This trick 
doesn’t work in the All Books Collection; read on.)
• 	Once you’ve tapped Select and then selected a book (or several), 
the Move button becomes available. It opens the Collections screen 
shown below. The idea is that you can create subfolders for your 
books, called collections. You might have one for school, one for 
work, and a third for somebody who shares your iPad, for example. 
Tap an existing collection to move the selected titles, or tap New 
Collection to create and name a new collection.
Tip: To switch your bookshelf view among collections, tap the 
collection’s name. It’s the top-center button, which starts out saying, 
for example, All Books or PDFs.

The Built-In Apps
309
• If you’ve loaded some PDF documents, then you can switch between 
the Books and PDFs bookshelves by tapping the top-center button to 
open the Collections panel.
• The Search bar above the book covers lets you search by author or 
title—not just your books, but the entire iBooks store.
• When you first start using a new iPad, iPhone, or Mac, your book 
covers bear the U symbol. It means: “Our records show that you’ve 
bought this book, but it’s still online, in your great Apple locker in the 
sky. Tap to download it to your iPad so you can start reading.”
Reading
But come on—you’re a reader, not a librarian. Here’s how you read an 
ebook.
Open the book or PDF by tapping the book cover. Now the book opens, 
ready for you to read. Looks great, doesn’t it? (If you’re returning to a book 
you’ve been reading, iBooks remembers your place.)
In iOS 8, if the iPad detects that it’s nighttime (or just dark where you are), 
the screen appears with white text against a black background. That’s to 
prevent the bright white light of your iPad from disturbing other people in, 
for example, the movie theater. (This is the Night theme described below, 
and you can turn it off.)
Tip: Try turning the iPad 90 degrees. In landscape orientation, you see 
a two-page spread. In portrait orientation, you get a single, bigger 
page.
Reading is simple. Turn the page by tapping the margin of the page—or 
swiping your finger across the page. (If you swipe slowly, you can actually 
see the “paper” bending over—in fact, you can see through to the “ink” on 
the other side of the page! Amaze your friends.) You can tap or swipe the 
left edge (to go back a page) or the right edge (to go forward).
Tip: This is Lock Rotation’s big moment. When you want to read lying 
down, you can prevent the text from rotating 90 degrees using Lock 
Rotation (page 23).
But if you tap a page, a row of additional controls appears:
• Library takes you back to the bookshelf view.
• Ç opens the Table of Contents. The chapter or page names are 
“live”— you can tap one to jump there.

Chapter 10
310
• ¡ lets you change the look of the page. For example, this panel 
offers a screen-brightness slider. That’s a nice touch, because the 
brightness of the screen makes a big difference in the comfort of your 
reading. (This is the same control you’d find in the Control Center or 
in Settings.) 
A pair of A buttons controls the type size—a huge feature for people 
with tired or over-40 eyes. And it’s something paper books definitely 
can’t do. Tap the larger one repeatedly to enlarge the text; tap the 
smaller one to shrink it.
The same panel offers a Fonts button, where you can choose from 
seven different typefaces for your book, as well as a Themes but-
ton, which lets you specify whether the page itself is White, Night 
(black page, white text, for nighttime reading), or Sepia (off-white). 
As promised, there’s an Auto-Night Theme button; if you don’t care 
for the white-on-black theme in dark environments, then turn off this 
switch.
Tip: New in iOS 8: a Scrolling View switch. In Scrolling View, you don’t 
turn book “pages” (and in landscape orientation, you see one page 
instead of two). Instead, the entire book scrolls vertically, as though 
printed on an infinite roll of Charmin.
• ¢ opens the search box. It lets you search for text within the book 
you’re reading, which can be extremely useful. As a bonus, there are 
also Search Web and Search Wikipedia buttons so you can hop online 
to learn more about something you’ve just read. 

The Built-In Apps
311
• ﬂ adds a bookmark to the current page. This isn’t like a physical 
bookmark, where there’s usually only one in the whole book; you can 
use it to flag as many pages, for as many reasons, as you like.
• Chapter slider. At the bottom of the screen, a slider represents the 
chapters of your book. Tap or drag it to jump around in the book; as 
you drag, a pop-up indicator shows you what chapter and page num-
ber you’re scrolling to. (If you’ve magnified the font size, of course, 
your book consumes more pages.)
Tip: An iBook can include pictures and even videos. Double-tap a picture 
in a book to zoom in on it.
When you’re reading a PDF document, by the way, you can do something 
you can’t do when reading regular iBooks: zoom in and out using the usual 
two-finger pinch-and-spread gestures. Very handy indeed.
Tip: On the other hand, here are some features that don’t work in 
PDF files (only ebooks): font and type-size changes, page-turn 
animations, sepia or black backgrounds, highlighting, and notes.
Notes, Bookmarks, Highlighting, Dictionary
Here are some more stunts that you’d have trouble pulling off in a printed 
book. If you double-tap a word, or hold your finger down on a word, you 
get a bar that offers these options:
• Copy, of course, copies the selected text so you can paste it 
somewhere.
• Define. Opens up a page from iBooks’ built-in dictionary. You know—
in the unlikely event that you encounter a word you don’t know. 
• Highlight. Adds tinted, transparent highlighting, or underlining, to 
the word you tapped. For best results, don’t tap the Highlight button 
until you’ve first grabbed the blue dot handles and dragged them to 
enclose the entire passage you want highlighted. 
Once you tap Highlight, the buttons change into a special Highlight 
bar (next page, middle). The first button opens a third row of buttons 
(bottom), so that you can specify which highlight color you want. 
(The final button designates underlining.)
The second button (T) removes highlighting. The third lets you add 
a note, as described next. The P button opens the Share sheet, also 
described momentarily.

Chapter 10
312
• Note. This feature creates highlighting on the selected passage and 
opens an empty colored sticky note, complete with keyboard, so you 
can type in your own annotations. When you tap outside the note to 
close it, your note collapses down to a tiny yellow Post-it peeking out 
from the right edge of the margin. Tap to reopen it. 
To delete a note, tap the highlighted text. Tap T.
• Search opens the same search box that you’d get by tapping the ¢ 
icon—except this time, the highlighted word is already filled in, saving 
you a bit of typing.
• Share opens the Share sheet (page 279) so you can send the 
highlighted material to somebody else by message or email, post it 
to Facebook or Twitter, or copy it to your Clipboard for pasting into 
another app. 

The Built-In Apps
313
• Speak reads the highlighted passage aloud. (This button appears 
only if you’ve turned on Speak Selection in SettingsÆ​GeneralÆ​
AccessibilityÆ​Speech.) Thank you, Siri!
There are a couple of cool things going on with your bookmarks, notes, 
and highlighting, by the way. Once you’ve added them to your book, 
they’re magically and wirelessly synced to any other copies of that book—
on other gadgets, like the iPhone or iPod Touch, other iPads, or even Macs 
running OS X Mavericks or later. Very handy indeed.
Furthermore, if you tap the Ç button to open the Table of Contents, 
you’ll see the Bookmarks and Notes tabs. Each presents a tidy list of all 
your bookmarked pages, notes, and highlighted passages. You can tap P 
(and then Share Notes) to print or email your notes, or tap one of the list-
ings to jump to the relevant page. 
Books That Read to You
iBooks can actually read to you! It’s a great feature when you’re driving 
or jogging, when someone’s just learning to read, or when you’re having 
trouble falling asleep. In iOS 8, there’s even a special control panel just for 
managing your free audiobook reader.
To get started, open SettingsÆGeneralÆAccessibilityÆSpeech. Turn on 
Speak Screen.
Then open a book in iBooks. Swipe down the page with two fingers to 
make the iPad start reading the book to you, out loud, with a synthesized 
voice. At the same time, a palette appears, offering these speech controls:
After a few seconds, the palette shrinks into a > button at the edge of the 
screen—and, after that, it becomes transparent, as though trying to make 
itself as invisible as possible. You can, of course, tap it to reopen it.

Chapter 10
314
Yes, this is exactly the feature that debuted in the Amazon Kindle and was 
then removed when publishers screamed bloody murder—but, somehow, 
so far, Apple has gotten away with it.
iBooks Settings
If you’ve embraced the simple joy of reading electronic books on your iPad, 
then you need to know where to make settings changes: in SettingsÆ​
iBooks. Here are the options waiting there:
• Full Justification. Ordinarily, iBooks presents text with fully justified 
margins (left). Turn this off if you prefer ragged right margins (right).
• Auto-hyphenation. Sometimes, typesetting looks better if hyphens 
allow partial words to appear at the right edge of each line. Especially 
if you’ve also turned on Full Justification.
• Both Margins Advance. Usually, tapping the right edge of the screen 
turns to the next page, and tapping the left edge turns back a page. If 
you turn on this option, then tapping either edge of the screen opens 
the next page. That can be handy if you’re a lefty, for example.
• Sync Bookmarks and Notes, Sync Collections. Turn these on if you’d 
like your bookmarks, notes, and book collections to be synced with 
your other Apple gadgets.
• Online Content. A few books contain links to video or audio clips 
online. This option comes set to Off, because video and audio can eat 
up your monthly cellular data allotment like a hungry teenager.

Maps
Here it is, folks, the feature that made international headlines: the Maps 
app.
From its birth in 2007, the iPad always came with Google Maps—an excel-
lent mapping and navigation app. (Apple wrote it, but Google provided 
the maps and navigation data.) But in iOS 6, Apple replaced it with a new 
mapping system of its own.
Why? Apple says Google was withholding features like spoken turn-
by-turn directions and smoothly drawn (vector-based) map images. 
Furthermore, as the rivalry intensified, Apple no longer wanted to share 
the super-valuable data generated by all those millions of moving iPads 
with Google.
Unfortunately, in its initial version, the databases underlying the Maps app 
had a lot of problems. They didn’t include nearly as many points of inter-
est (buildings, stores, landmarks) as Google. Addresses were sometimes 
wrong. 
Apple promised to keep working on Maps until it was all fixed, but in the 
meantime, in a remarkable apology letter, CEO Tim Cook recommended 
using one of its rivals. By far the best one is Google Maps. It’s free; it’s 
amazingly smart (it knows what address you mean after you type only a 
few letters); it has public transportation details, live traffic reports, Street 
View (you can see photos of most addresses, and even “look around” you), 
and, of course, Google’s far superior maps and data.
All right—you’ve been warned. It may still take some time before Apple 
Maps is complete and reliable. 
But while Apple’s cartographical elves keep working on cleaning up the 
underlying maps, some of its features are pretty great. And if you have a 
Mac (running OS X Mavericks or later), you can look up a destination on 
the Mac and then send the directions wirelessly to your iPad.
Here’s what you have to look forward to.
Meet Maps 
The underlying geographical database may need work, but Maps, the app 
itself, is a thing of beauty. 
It lets you type in any address or point of interest in the U.S. or many other 
countries and see it plotted on a map, with turn-by-turn driving direc-
tions, just like a $300 windshield GPS unit. It also gives you a live national 

Chapter 10
316
Yellow Pages business directory and real-time traffic-jam alerts. You have 
a choice of a street-map diagram or actual aerial photos, taken by satellite.
And Maps offers Flyover, an amazing aerial, 360-degree 3-D view of major 
cities. 
Maps Basics
When you open Maps, a blue dot represents your current location. Double-
tap to zoom in, over and over again, until you’re seeing actual city blocks. 
You can also pinch or spread two fingers to shrink or magnify the view. 
Drag or flick to scroll around the map.
To zoom out again, you can use the rare two-finger double-tap. 
At any time, you can tap the * button in the corner of the screen to open 
a panel of options. Here you can tap your choice of amazing map views: 
Standard (street-map illustration), Satellite (stunning aerial photos), or 
Hybrid (photos superimposed with street names).
There’s no guarantee that the Satellite view provides a very recent photo—
different parts of the Maps database use photography taken at different 
times—but it’s still very cool.

The Built-In Apps
317
Note: You’ll know when you’ve zoomed in to the resolution limits of 
Apple’s satellite imagery; it will just stop zooming. Do some two-
finger double-taps to back out.
You can twist two fingers to rotate the map. (A compass icon at top right 
helps you keep your bearings; you can tap it to restore the map’s usual 
north-is-up orientation.) And if you drag two fingers up the screen, you tilt 
the map into 3-D view, which makes it look more like you’re surveying the 
map at an angle instead of straight down. 
Finding Yourself
If any tablet can tell you where you are, it’s the iPad. It has not one, not two, 
but three ways to determine your location.
• GPS. First, the cellular iPads (not the WiFi-only models) contain a 
traditional GPS chip, of the sort that’s found in automotive naviga-
tion units from Garmin, TomTom, and others. If the iPad has a good 
view of the sky and isn’t confounded by skyscrapers, then it can do 
a decent job of consulting the 24 satellites that make up the Global 
Positioning System and determining its own location.
• Google’s cellular triangulation system. A cellular iPad can also check 
its proximity to the cellphone towers around you. Software from 
Google relies upon its knowledge of cellular towers’ locations. The 
accuracy isn’t as good as GPS—you’re lucky if it puts you within a 
block or two of your actual location—but it’s something.
• Wi-Fi Positioning System. Metropolitan areas today are blanketed 
by overlapping WiFi signals. At a typical Manhattan intersection, you 
might be in range of 20 base stations. Each one broadcasts its own 
name and unique network address (its MAC address—nothing to do 
with Mac computers) once every second. Although you’d need to be 
within 150 feet or so to actually get onto the Internet, a laptop or iPad 
can detect this beacon signal from up to 1,500 feet away.
Imagine if you could correlate all those beacon signals with their 
physical locations. Why, you’d be able to simulate GPS—without the 
GPS!
So for years, millions of iPhones have been quietly logging all those 
WiFi signals, noting their network addresses and locations. (An 
iPhone never had to connect to these base stations. It was just read-
ing the one-way beacon signals.)
At this point, Apple’s database knows about millions of hotspots—and 
the precise longitude and latitude of each. 

Chapter 10
318
So now you know how the WiFi-only iPad can find out its location, 
sort of: It sniffs for WiFi base stations. 
That accuracy is good to within only 100 feet, and of course the sys-
tem fails completely when you’re not in any WiFi hotspots. In gen-
eral, therefore, using Maps as a navigational tool is useful only for the 
cellular iPad models.
Tip: The iPad’s location circuits eat into battery power. To shut them 
down when you’re not using them, open SettingsÆPrivacy and turn 
off Location Services. 
All right—now that you know how the iPad gets its location information, 
here’s how you can use it. Its first trick is to show you where you are. 
Tap the ˜ at the bottom of the Maps screen. The button turns white, indi-
cating that the iPad is consulting its various references to figure out where 
you are. You show up as a blue pushpin that moves with you. That’s the 
iPad saying, “OK, pal, I’ve got you. You’re here.” It keeps tracking until you 
tap the ˜ enough times to turn it off. 
Orienting Maps 
It’s great to see a blue pin on the map, and all—but the iPad can also show 
you which way you’re facing.
Just tap the ˜ button twice. The map spins so that the direction you’re 
facing is upward, and the ˜ icon points straight up. A “flashlight beam” 
emanates from your blue dot; its width indicates the iPad’s degree of con-
fidence. (The narrower the beam, the surer it is.)
Searching Maps
You’re not always interested in finding out where you are; often, you know 
that much perfectly well. Instead, you want to see where something else is. 
Now, the following paragraphs guide you through using the search box at 
the top of Maps. But, frankly, if you use it, you’re a sucker. It’s much quicker 
to use Siri to specify what you want to find. 
You can say, for example, “Show me the map of Detroit” or “Show me the 
closest Starbucks” or “Give me directions to 200 West 79th Street in New 
York.” Siri shows you that spot on a map; tap to jump into the Maps app.
If you must use the search box, though, here’s how it works: Tap in the 
search box to summon the iPad keyboard. (If there’s already something in 
the box, tap ˛ to clear it out.) Here’s what Maps can find for you:

The Built-In Apps
319
• An address. You can skip the periods (and usually the commas, too). 
And you can use abbreviations. Typing 710 w end ave ny ny will 
find 710 West End Avenue, New York, New York. (In this and any of 
the other examples, you can type a Zip code instead of a city and a 
state.)
• An intersection. Type 57th and lexington, ny ny. Maps will find the 
spot where East 57th Street crosses Lexington Avenue in New York 
City.
• A city. Type chicago il to see that city. You can zoom in from there.
• A Zip code or a neighborhood. Type 10024 or greenwich village. 
• Latitude and longitude coordinates. Type 40.7484° N, 73.9857° W. 
• A point of interest. Type washington monument or niagara falls.
• A business type. Type drugstores in albany ny or hospitals in 
roanoke va.
When Maps finds a specific address, an animated, red-topped pushpin 
comes flying down onto its precise spot on the map. A bubble identifies 
the location by name. 
Tap outside the bubble to hide it. Tap the map pin to bring the bubble 
back. Tap the d icon for instant driving directions.
TIP: Or walking directions. You choose whether you mostly walk or drive 
(and therefore which Maps suggests) in SettingsÆMaps.
Tap the ’ to open the Location page; read on.

Chapter 10
320
The Location Page
Once you’ve found something on the map—your current position, say, or 
something you’ve searched for—you can drop a pin there for future ref-
erence. Tap the * button; when the page slides up, tap Drop a Pin. A 
blue pushpin appears. (You can drag the pin to move it, if your aim wasn’t 
exact.)
TIP: You can also drop a pin by holding your finger down on the right 
spot.
There are also the red pushpins that represent addresses you’ve looked 
up. And there are the tiny icons that represent restaurants, stores, and 
other establishments in Apple’s (actually Yelp’s) database.
All these pushpins and nano-icons are tappable. You get a little label that 
identifies each one. And if you tap the ’ on that label, you open a details 
screen called the Location page. 
Here links let you bookmark the spot, get directions, add it to Contacts, or 
share it with other people (via AirDrop, email, text message, Facebook, or 

The Built-In Apps
321
Twitter). Often, what you’re after are the Directions To Here and Directions 
From Here links (“here” meaning your current location). 
If this is the location for a restaurant or a business, you might strike gold: 
The Location page might offer several screens full of useful information, 
courtesy of Yelp.com. You’ll see customer reviews, photos, hours of opera-
tion, delivery and reservation information, and so on.
The Location screen may also offer the Popular Apps Nearby link. It lists 
apps that other people have downloaded in the vicinity. Sometimes there’s 
no rhyme or reason to them, but sometimes you’ll discover a gem that 
pertains to the place you’re scoping out: a guide app, for example.
Finding Friends and Businesses
Maps is also plugged into your Contacts list, which makes it especially 
easy to find a friend’s house (or just to see how ritzy his neighborhood is).
Instead of typing an address into the empty search bar, tap inside it; a list 
of recent searches appears (it’s designed to save you time if you need 
those directions again). Tap Favorites. You arrive at the Favorites/Recents/
Contacts panel, containing three lists that can save you a lot of typing.
Two of them are described in the next section. But if you tap Contacts, you 
see your master address book (Chapter 4). Tap a name. In a flash, Maps 
drops a red, animated pushpin onto the map to identify that address.
Tip: As you type, the iPad displays a list of matching names. Tap the one 
you want to find on the map.
That pushpin business also comes into play when you use Maps as a glori­
fied national Yellow Pages. If you type, for example, pharmacy 60609, 
then those red pushpins show you all the drugstores in that Chicago Zip 
code. It’s a great way to find a gas station, a cash machine, or a hospital 
in a pinch. Tap a pushpin to see the name of the corresponding business.
As usual, you can tap the ’ button in the map pin’s label bubble to open 
a details screen. If you’ve searched for a friend, then you see the corre-
sponding Contacts card. If you’ve searched for a business, then you get a 
screen containing its phone number, address, Web site, and so on; often, 
you get a beautiful page of Yelp information (photos, reviews, ratings). 
Remember that you can tap a Web address to open it.
In both cases, you get two useful buttons, labeled Directions To Here and 
Directions From Here. You also get a P button; on the resulting Share 
sheet, you have the option to send the address to someone by AirDrop, 
Message, or Mail (for a restaurant where you’re supposed to meet, for 

Chapter 10
322
example)—or to bookmark this address for use later (Add to Favorites), as 
described next.
Favorites and Recents
One nice thing about Maps is the way it tries to eliminate typing at every 
step. The Favorites/Recents/Contacts screen is a great example. 
In iOS 8, you have to tap in the search bar and then tap Favorites to find 
it. But here they are: three lists that spare you from having to type stuff.
• Favorites are addresses you’ve flagged for later use by tapping Add 
to Favorites, an option that appears whenever you tap the P on a 
place’s details screen. For sure you should bookmark your home and 
workplace. That will make it much easier to request driving directions.
• Recents are searches you’ve conducted. You’d be surprised at how 
often you want to call up the same spot again later—and now you 
can, just by tapping its name in this list. You can also tap Clear to 
empty the list—if, for example, you intend to elope and don’t want 
your parents to find out. (This is actually the same list that appears 
when you tap the empty search box, right there on the screen.)
• Contacts is your iPad address book. One tap maps out where some-
one lives.

The Built-In Apps
323
Tap a destination to see it on the map, or tap anywhere on the map to 
back out without choosing a destination. 
Directions
Suppose you’ve just searched for a place (below, top) and then tapped its 
name. The place’s bubble is open on the screen.
Now you can tap Directions (or the blue car icon next to the place name) 
for instant directions (below, bottom). 
If there’s no identified address yet, tapping Directions produces two search 
bars, labeled Start and End. Plug in two addresses—the Start address may 
already say “Current Location”—and let Maps guide you from the first to 
the second. You can use any of the address shortcuts on page 319, or 
you can tap one of the recent searches listed here. (Or, after performing 
any search that produces a pushpin, you can tap the ’ in its label bubble 
and then tap Directions To Here or Directions From Here on the details 
screen.)

Chapter 10
324
Tip: If you tap …, you swap the Start and End points. That’s a great way 
to find your way back after a trip.
In any case, once you’ve told Maps where you’re going, you can tell it 
how you’re going. Three buttons say Drive, Walk (yes, walking directions), 
and Apps. This last button is supposed to make up for Maps’ lack of pub-
lic-transportation guidance. It presents a page from the App Store that 
offers train- and bus-schedule apps, relevant to the city of your search, for 
downloading.
Maps also displays an overview of the route you’re about to drive. In fact, 
it usually proposes several different routes. They’re labeled with little tags 
that identify how long each will take you: 3 hrs 37 min, 4 hrs 11 min, and 4 
hrs 33 min, for example. 
If you tap one of these tags, the bottom of the screen lets you know the 
distance and estimated time for that option and identifies the main roads 
you’ll be on. 
Tap the Route label you want and then tap Start to see the first driving 
instruction. 
The map zooms into the actual road you’ll be traveling, which looks like it’s 
been drawn in with blue highlighter, and Navigation mode begins.
Navigation Mode
When the iPad is guiding you to a location, Maps behaves exactly like a 
windshield GPS unit, but better looking and with less clutter to distract 
you. You see a simplified map of the world around you, complete with the 
outlines of buildings, with huge white directional banners that tell you how 
to turn next, and onto what street. Siri’s familiar voice speaks the same 
information at the right times, so you don’t even have to look at the screen.
Even if you hit the Sleep switch to lock the iPad, the voice guidance con-
tinues. (It also continues even if you switch to another app; return to Maps 
by tapping the banner at the top of the screen.)
If you do tap the Maps screen, however, a few extra controls appear. The 
top bar shows your projected arrival time, plus the remaining distance and 
time. It also offers the End button, which makes the navigation stop. Tap 
End when you suddenly recognize where you are, for example, and don’t 
need Siri’s opinion anymore.
The Navigation mode is meant to be a hands-free, distraction-free guid-
ance system only. While Maps is guiding you, you can’t zoom in and out, 
nor can you pan the map to look ahead at upcoming turns or to inspect 
alternate routes. (You can twist two fingers to turn the map, but it snaps 
back as soon as you let go.) 

The Built-In Apps
325
But if you tap Overview in the upper-right corner, your entire planned 
route shrinks down to fit on a single screen. Now you see your entire route, 
and you can zoom, turn, and pan. To return to the navigation screen, tap 
Resume.
At the bottom, these buttons await:
• 3D. Tap to view the map at an angle. In major cities, you even see 3-D 
shapes of the buildings.
• List Steps. Tap to get a written list of turn-by-turn instructions.
• ß. You can adjust the volume of Siri’s speaking voice as she gives you 
driving directions by tapping here. Choose Low, Medium, or Loud 
Volume, or turn off her voice prompts altogether with No Voice. 
Tap the screen to hide these additional controls once again.
Night Mode
If the iPad’s ambient light sensor decides that it’s dark in your car, it 
switches to a dimmer, grayer version of the map. It wouldn’t want to dis-
tract you, after all. When there’s light, it brightens back up again.

Traffic
How’s this for a cool feature? Free, real-time traffic reporting. Just tap the 
* button (it’s visible whenever you’re not in Navigation mode), and then 
tap Show Traffic. Now traffic jams appear as dashed red lines on the rele-
vant roads, for your stressing pleasure; less severe slowdowns show up as 
dashed yellow lines.
Better yet, tiny icons appear, representing accidents and construction 
sites. Tap the icon to make a quick description tag appear (like “Accident, 
Park Ave at State St”); tap that tag to read a full-screen account of what’s 
going on.
If you don’t see any dotted lines, it’s either because traffic is moving fine or 
because Apple doesn’t have any information for those roads. Usually, you 
get traffic info only for highways, and only in metropolitan areas.
Flyover
You don’t need a car to use Flyover, the Maps app’s most dazzling feature; 
it has nothing to do with navigation, really. You can operate it even while 
you’re lying on your couch like a slug.
Flyover is a dynamic, interactive, photographic 3-D model of certain major 
cities. It looks something like an aerial video, except that you control the 
virtual camera. You can pan around these scenes, looking over and around 
buildings to see what’s behind them. To create this feature, Apple says, it 
spent two years filming cities in helicopters.

The Built-In Apps
327
To try it, you must be in Satellite or Hybrid view (tap * to get there). Enter 
3-D mode by dragging down the screen with two fingers (or tap *, then 
Show 3D Map). 
Wait for a moment as the iPad downloads the photographic models. Now 
you can go nuts, conducting your own virtual chopper tour of the city 
using the usual techniques:
• Drag with one finger to move around the map.
• 	Pinch or spread two fingers to zoom in or out.
• 	Drag two fingers up or down to change your camera angle relative to 
the ground.
• 	Twist two fingers to turn the world before you.
It’s immersing, completely amazing, and very unlikely to make you airsick.
Flyover Tours
In iOS 8, Apple wasn’t satisfied with letting you pan around virtual 3-D city 
models using your finger. Now it’s prepared to give you city tours in 3-D.
Use the search box to enter the name of a big city or major landmark. 
(Some examples: San Francisco, New York, Tokyo, London, Paris, Rome, 
Madrid, Vancouver, San Jose, Cape Town, Stockholm. Or places like 

Chapter 10
328
Yosemite National Park, Sydney Opera House, Stonehenge, St. Peter’s 
Basilica, or the Brooklyn Bridge.)
When you hit Search, a new control appears just beneath the Start box; 
“3D Flyover Tour.” When you tap Start, you’re in for a crazy treat: a fully 
automated video tour of that city or place. The San Francisco tour shows 
you the baseball park, the famous Transamerica Pyramid, the Alcatraz 
prison island, and so on. It’s slow, soothing, cool, and definitely something 
that paper maps never did.
Newsstand
Just about every major magazine and newspaper now offers a download-
able electronic version; your iPad can download and “deliver” them in the 
background automatically. They show up right here, in Newsstand. In fact, 
you can’t move their icons anywhere else. 
Newsstand is the mutant love child of an app and a folder. Like an app, it 
shows up in the app switcher when you double-press the Home button. 
Like a folder, when you tap it, you don’t leave the Home screen. Instead, a 

The Built-In Apps
329
bookshelf version of a folder opens, showing the icons of your subscrip-
tions. You can’t find Newsstand by searching, either.
Tip
You can drag Newsstand into another folder to hide it—a great 
option if you never use it.
Tap one of these magazine or newspaper icons to open it. 
Why is Newsstand a pseudo-folder? Because each magazine or newspa-
per is different. Some are self-contained apps. Others are just glorified 
PDF files. Some are nothing more than links to other apps elsewhere on 
your iPad (like The New York Times, for example).
At least you know where to find them all.
To subscribe to something, tap Store in the corner. You arrive at what 
should look familiar by now: the usual App Store screen, composed of 
horizontally scrolling categories. You’re looking at a special corner of the 
store that’s dedicated to e-publications. Tap the name of one to see sam-

Chapter 10
330
ple pages, read a description, peruse reviews from other readers—and, if 
you like what you see, download it. 
Most big-name magazines, by the way, appear to be free. You can down-
load them, view their covers in your Newsstand “folder,” and so on. But 
you’re really downloading only a shell—a mini-store just for that magazine. 
When you actually open it, you’re asked to pay $4 or $5 to buy issues 
within that app.
In the same vein, you don’t see individual issues on your Newsstand book-
shelf. You see one cover for each magazine; other issues are inside it. A 
blue dot appears beneath the cover to let you know that a new issue has 
arrived.
Notes
The Notes app is the closest thing the iPad has to a word processor. It’s 
nice to be able to jot down—or dictate—lists, reminders, and brainstorms. 
You can email them to yourself when you’re finished—or sync them right 
to your Mac or PC. In iOS 8, you can now format your text with bold, italic, 
or underlining, and you can insert a photo.
The first time you open Notes, you see what looks like a blank white page. 
Tap to make the keyboard appear so you can begin typing. When you’re 
finished with a note for now, tap the ¶ key to put away the keyboard (or 
just tap somewhere else). 

The Built-In Apps
331
At all times, a handy row of icons appears at the top of your Notes page. 
The rundown:
• T. Tap to delete the current note. After you confirm your decision, the 
note vanishes. 
• P. Tap to print your note, copy it, or send it to someone by email, 
text message, AirDrop, and so on. (See page 279 for more on the 
sharing options.)
• √ starts a new blank note. 
The Table of Contents
Notes keeps a handy list of your notes’ first lines—a little table of contents, 
most recent at the top. When the iPad is in landscape mode, this list is 
always open at the left side of the screen. In portrait mode, tap Notes at 
top left to see it.
In any case, this list is the only way to jump from one note to another. To 
open a note, tap its name. To delete a note, you can swipe across its name 
in the list, right to left, and then confirm by tapping Delete.
There’s a search box here, too. Tap in it to open the keyboard. You can now 
search all your notes instantly—not just their titles, but also the text inside 
them.
Syncing Notes
The real beauty of this app is that it can synchronize your collection of Notes 
with all kinds of other Apple gear—other iPads, iPhones, iPod Touches, 
and Mountain Lion or later Macs—so the same notes are waiting for you 
everywhere you look. Just make sure Notes is turned on in SettingsÆiCloud 
on each iPad or tablet, and in System PreferencesÆiCloud on your Mac. 
The rest is automatic.
Notes Accounts
Your notes can also sync wirelessly with the Notes modules on Google, 
Yahoo, AOL, Exchange, or another IMAP email account. To set this up, 
open SettingsÆMail, Contacts, Calendars. Tap the account you want 
(iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, or whatever); finally, turn the Notes switch On.
That should do it. Now your notes are synced nearly instantly, wirelessly, 
both directions. 

Chapter 10
332
Note: One catch: Notes that you create at gmail.com, aol.com, or yahoo.
com don’t wind up on the iPad. Those accounts sync wirelessly 
in one direction only: from the iPad to the Web site, where the 
notes arrive in a Notes folder. (There’s no problem, however, if 
you get your AOL or Gmail mail in an email program like Outlook, 
Entourage, or Apple Mail. Then it’s two-way syncing as usual.)
At this point, a Folders or Accounts button appears at the top-left corner 
of the Notes list. Tap it to see your note sets from Google, Yahoo, AOL, 
Exchange, iCloud, or an IMAP email account.
If you’ve created Notes folders in OS X on your Mac (Mountain Lion or 
later), then you see those folders here, too.
All of this makes life a little more complex, of course. For example, when 
you create a note, you have to worry about which account it’s about to go 
into. To do that, be sure to specify an account name (and a folder within it, 
if necessary) before you create the new note. 
Note: In SettingsÆNotes, you can also specify which of your different 
Notes accounts you want to be the main one—the one that new 
notes fall into if you haven’t specified otherwise.
Photo Booth
It may be goofy, it may be pointless, but the Photo Booth app is a bigger 
time drain than Solitaire, the Web, and Dancing with the Stars put together.
Photo Booth takes your front-facing camera into a world of special visual 
effects. Some make you look like a pinhead, or bulbous, or like a Siamese 
twin; others simulate Andy Warhol paintings, fisheye lenses, and charcoal 
sketches. 
When you find an effect that looks appealing (or unappealing, depending 
on your goals here), tap it. Have fun posing and goofing around.
At any time, you can tap ®. Snap!—your screen flashes white to add illu-
mination to your face, and the resulting photo’s thumbnail joins the hori-
zontally scrolling collection at the bottom.
Tap one to see it full-screen. At point, you’ll discover that these master-
pieces of goofiness and distortion aren’t locked in Photo Booth forever. 
Tap P to share.
Or T to delete. Or A to start over.

The Built-In Apps
333
As you set off on your Photo Booth adventures, a note of caution: Keep 
it away from children. They won’t move from Photo Booth for the next 12 
years.
Podcasts
A podcast is a “TV” or “radio” show that’s distributed online. 
Lots of podcasts begin life as actual radio and TV shows; most of NPR’s 
shows are available as podcasts, for example, so you can listen to them 
whenever and wherever you like.
But thousands more are recorded just for downloading. They range from 
recordings made by professionals in high-end studios to amateurs talking 
into their phones. Some have thousands of regular listeners; some have 
only a handful. 
One thing’s for sure: There’s a podcast out there that precisely matches 
whatever weird, narrow interests you have.
The Podcasts app is designed to help you find, subscribe to, organize, and 
listen to podcasts. It’s designed just like Apple’s online stores for apps, 
music, movies, and so on. For example, tap Featured to see scrolling rows 

Chapter 10
334
of recommended podcasts, or Top Charts to see what the rest of the world 
seems to be listening to these days. Or use Search to look for something 
specific. 
Don’t miss the Video tab (on the Featured and Top Charts screens), by the 
way. The most popular videocasts are usually clips from network or cable 
TV shows, but there are plenty of quirky, offbeat, funny video podcasts 
that will never be seen except on tablet and phone screens.

The Built-In Apps
335
In any case, once you find a podcast episode that seems interesting (fac-
ing page, bottom), you can listen to it in either of two ways: 
• Stream it. Tap a podcast’s name to play it directly from the Internet. 
It’s never stored on your iPad and doesn’t take up any space, but it 
does require an Internet connection. Generally no good for plane 
rides.
• Download it. If you tap the U next to a podcast’s name, you down-
load it to your iPad. It takes up space there (and podcasts can be 
big)—but you can play it back anytime, anywhere. And, of course, you 
can delete it when you’re done.
Subscribing
Most podcasts are series. Their creators crank them out every week or 
whatever. If you find one you love, subscribe to it, so that your iPad down-
loads each new episode automatically. Just tap SUBSCRIBE on its details 
page. 
The episodes wind up on the My Podcasts screen. Tap an icon to open 
the Episodes screen, where you can tap Unplayed (episodes you haven’t 
heard) or Feed (all episodes). Other buttons include Edit (delete episodes 
en masse); Settings (for this podcast only, as described next); and P (pass 
along links to this podcast by Messages, Mail, Twitter, Facebook, and so 
on).
Settings
There’s a lot to control when it comes to podcasts. Do you want new epi-
sodes downloaded automatically? Do you want them auto-deleted when 
you’re finished? Do you want to limit how many episodes of each show 
are stored on your iPad? What playback order—oldest first or newest first?
You make all of these choices in SettingsÆPodcasts. That’s the global set-
ting for podcasts—but you can also override them for individual podcast 
shows, using the Settings button described above.
Playback
To play a podcast, tap its icon on My Podcasts (facing page), and then tap 
the episode name. At this point, all the usual audio-playback controls are 
available (page 39)—with the handy addition of buttons that speed up 
or slow down the talking (.5x, 1x, 1.5x, or 2x regular speed). There’s a Sleep 
Timer, too, so that you can drift off to the sound of a droning podcaster.

Chapter 10
336
You can press the Sleep switch to turn off the screen; the podcast con-
tinues playing. And even if the iPad is locked, you can open the Control 
Center (page 37) to access the playback controls.
Tip: Don’t forget to use Siri! You can say things like “Play ‘Fresh Air’ 
podcast,” “Play my latest podcasts,” “Play my podcast” (to resume 
what you listened to last), “Play latest TED podcast,” and so on.
Stations
A station is a playlist of podcasts. A smart playlist, actually, because it can 
update itself according to your specs.
To create one, tap My Stations and then New Station. Name it (“Jogging,” 
“The drive to work,” whatever) and tap Save. 
Now you’re shown a list of your subscriptions. Tap the ones that you want 
to be part of your station, and then tap Done. That’s it: You’re ready to 
play! (Any podcast playlists you’ve created on your computer, in iTunes, 
appear on the My Stations list, too.)
When you tap a station’s name, its page offers a Settings button. Here’s 
where you can tweak its settings: playback order, grouping (so that epi-
sodes of the same show play back together), how many episodes, audio 
or video podcasts, and so on.
Reminders
The Reminders app not only records your life’s little tasks, but it also 
reminds you about them, either when the right time comes or when you 
come to the right place. For example, it can remind you to water the plants 
as soon as you get home. 
If you have an iCloud account, your reminders sync across all your gad-
gets. Create or check off a task on your iPad, and you’ll also find it created 
or checked off on your iPhone, iPod Touch, Mac (thanks to Calendar), PC 
(thanks to Outlook or Exchange), and so on.
Tip: Reminders sync wirelessly with anything your iCloud account knows 
about: the iCal, Calendar, or BusyCal programs on your Mac, Outlook 
on the PC, and so on.
Siri and Reminders are a match made in heaven. “Remind me to file 
the Jenkins report when I get to work.” “Remind me to set the TiVo for 
tonight at 8.” “Remind me about Timmy’s soccer game a week from 
Saturday.” “Add waffles to my Groceries list.”

The Built-In Apps
337
The List of Lists
When you open Reminders, one thing becomes instantly apparent: You 
can create more than one to-do list, each with its own name: a groceries 
list, kids’ chores, a running tally of expenses, and so on. It’s a great way 
to log what you eat if you’re on a diet, or to keep a list of movies people 
recommend.
They show up as colorful tabs; tap one to see the to-do list within.
If you share an iCloud account with another family member, you might cre-
ate a different Reminders list for each person. (Of course, now you run the 
risk that your spouse might sneakily add items to your to-do list!)
If you have an Exchange account, one of your lists can be synced to your 
corporate Tasks list. It doesn’t offer all the features of the other lists in 
Reminders, but at least it’s kept tidy and separate.
To delete a list, tap Edit (lower left) and then tap Delete List.
Tip: You can use Siri to add things to individual lists by name. You can 
say, for example, “Add low-fat cottage cheese to the Groceries list.”
Siri can also find these reminders, saving you a lot of navigation 
later. You can say, “Find my reminder about dosage instructions,” for 
example.

Chapter 10
338
Once you’ve created some lists, you can easily switch among them. Just 
tap the title of a different list to open it.
To create a new list, tap Add List. If you have multiple accounts that offer 
reminders, you’re asked to specify which one will receive this new list 
(lower right). Now your jobs begin:
1.	 Enter a name for the list. When you tap the light-gray letters New 
List, the keyboard appears to help you out.
2.	 Tap a colored dot. This will be the color of the list’s title font and also 
of the “checked-off” circles once the list is under way (top right). 
3.	 Tap Done. Now you can tap the first blank line and enter the first item 
in the list.
Note: After that first line, you can’t create new items in the list by 
tapping the blank line below the existing items. As you type, 
tapping the Return key is the only way to move to the next line.
Later, you can assign a task to a different list by tapping List on its Details 
screen.
The Scheduled List
If you really do wind up using Reminders as a to-do list, you might be grati-
fied to discover that the app also offers a Scheduled list: a consolidated list 
of every item, from all your lists, to which you’ve given a deadline. 
Recording a Reminder
Once you’ve opened a list, here’s how you record a new task the man-
ual way: Tap the blank line beneath your existing reminders. Type your 
reminder (or dictate it). Tap the * to set up the details, described below; 
tap Done when you’re finished.

The Built-In Apps

As you go through life completing tasks, tap the circle next to each one. A 
checked-off to-do remains in place until the next time you visit its list. At 
that point, it disappears. It’s moved into a separate list called Completed.
But when you want to take pride in how much you’ve accomplished, you 
can tap Show Completed to bring your checked-off tasks back into view.
Other stuff you can do:
• Delete a to-do item altogether, as though it never existed. Swipe 
leftward across its name, and then tap Delete to confirm. 
• Delete a bunch of items in a row. Tap Edit. Tap each – icon, and then 
tap Delete to confirm.
• Rearrange a list so the items appear in a different order. Tap Edit, 
and then drag the H handle up or down. 
The Details Screen
If you tap * next to an item’s name, you arrive at the Details panel. Here 
you can set up a reminder that will pop up at a certain time or place, create 
an auto-repeating schedule, file this item into a different to-do list with its 
own name, add notes to this item, or delete it. Here are your options, one 
by one (next page, left):
• Remind me on a day. Here you can set up the iPad to chime at a 
certain date and time (tap whatever it says now to bring up the “time 
wheel”). 
Using the Repeat control, you can ask to be reminded about things 
that recur in your life, like quarterly tax payments, haircuts, and anni-
versaries.
• Remind me at a location. If you turn on this amazing feature, then 
the iPad will use its location circuits to remind you of this item when 
you arrive at a certain place or leave a certain place. When you tap 
Location, iPad proposes “Current Location”—wherever you are at the 
moment. That’s handy if, for example, you’re dropping off your dry 
cleaning and want to remember to pick it up the next time you’re 
driving by.
But you can also choose Home or Work (your home or work ad-
dresses, as you’ve set them up in Contacts). Or you can use the 
search box at the top, either to type (or dictate) a street address or to 
search your own Contacts list.

Chapter 10
340
Once you’ve specified an address, the Location screen shows a map. 
The diameter of the blue circle shows the area where your presence 
will trigger the appearance of the reminder on your screen (above, 
right).
Tip: You can adjust the size of this “geofence” by dragging the black 
handle to adjust the size of the circle. In effect, you’re telling the iPad 
how close you have to be to the specified address for the reminder 
to pop up. You can adjust the circle’s radius anywhere from 328 feet 
(“Remind me when I’m in that store”) to 1,500 miles (“Remind me 
when I’m in that country”).
The final step here is to tap either When I leave or When I arrive. 
Later, the iPad will remind you at the appointed time or as you ap-
proach (or leave) the appointed address, which is fairly mind-blowing 
the first few times it happens. 
Note: If you set up both a time reminder and a location reminder, then 
your iPad uses whichever event happens first. That is, if you ask 
to be reminded at 3 p.m. today and “When I arrive at the office,” 
then you’ll get the reminder when you get to the office—or at 3 
p.m., if that time rolls around before you make it to work.

• Priority. Tap one of these buttons to specify whether this item has 
low, medium, or high priority—or None. In some of the calendar 
programs that sync with Reminders, you can sort your task list by 
priority.
• List. Tap here to assign this to-do to a different reminder list.
• Notes. Here’s a handy box where you can record freehand notes 
about this item: an address, a phone number, details of any kind.
To exit the Details screen, tap Done.
Tips
Hey, check it out—Apple’s getting into the how-to game!
This new iOS 8 app is designed to show you tips and tricks for getting the 
most from your iPad. Each screen offers an animated illustration and a 
paragraph of text explaining one of iOS 8’s marvels. Swipe leftward to see 
the next tip, and the next, and the next. Or tap Ç to see a list of all the 
tips in one place.
Tap Like if it’s one of your favorites. Tap P to share a tip by text message,

T
he iPad’s concept as an all-screen machine is a curse and a bless-
ing. You may curse it when you’re trying to type text, wishing 
you had real keys. But when you’re online—oh, baby. That’s when 
the Web comes to life, looming larger and clearer than you’d think pos-
sible. That’s when you see real email, full-blown YouTube videos, hyper-
clear Google maps, and all kinds of Internet goodness, right in your hand. 
So many of its miracles, however, depend on its ability to get online. And 
how likely it is to succeed depends on which model you bought: the WiFi-
only model, or the WiFi+Celluar model. 
Either way, it might help to explore your options.
WiFi Hotspots
WiFi, known to geeks as 802.11, is wireless networking, the same technol-
ogy that gets computers and phones online at high speed in any WiFi 
hotspot. All iPad models can get online through WiFi hotspots.
Hotspots are everywhere these days: in homes, offices, coffee shops, 
hotels, airports, and thousands of other places. Unfortunately, a hotspot is 
a bubble about 300 feet across; once you wander out of it, you’re off the 
Internet. So, in general, WiFi is for people who are sitting still.
When you’re in a WiFi hotspot, your iPad usually gets a fast connection 
to the Internet, as though it’s connected to a cable modem or DSL. Even 
if you bought the cellular keyboard model, it looks for a WiFi connection 
first and considers connecting to a cellular network only if there’s no WiFi.

Chapter 11
344
Sequence of Connections
The iPad isn’t online all the time. To save battery power, it opens the con-
nection only on demand: when you check email, request a Web page, and 
so on. At that point, the iPad tries to get online following this sequence:
• First, it sniffs around for a WiFi network that you’ve used before. If it 
finds one, it connects quietly and automatically. You’re not asked for 
permission, a password, or anything else. 
• If the iPad can’t find a previous hotspot, but it detects a new 
hotspot, a message appears (below, inset). It displays any new 
hotspots’ names; tap the one you want. (If you see a l icon, then that 
hotspot is password protected.) 
Silencing the “Want to Join?” Messages
Sometimes, you might be bombarded by those “Do you want to join?” 
messages at a time when you have no need to be online. You might want 
the iPad to stop bugging you—to stop offering WiFi hotspots. In that situ-
ation, from the Home screen, tap SettingsÆWi-Fi (or tell Siri, “Open WiFi 
settings”), and then turn off Ask to Join Networks. When this option is off, 

Getting Online
345
the iPad never interrupts you by bounding in, wagging its tail, and drop-
ping the name of a new network at your feet. In this case, to get onto a 
new network, you have to visit the aforementioned Settings screen and 
select it, as described next.
The List of Hotspots
At some street corners in big cities, WiFi signals bleeding out of apartment 
buildings give you a choice of 20 or 30 hotspots to join. But whenever the 
iPad invites you to join a hotspot, it suggests only a couple of them: the 
ones with the strongest signal and, if possible, no password requirement. 
NOTE: Sometimes, the overlords of a hotspot choose not to broadcast 
its name. If you know its name, though, you can still get onto it; 
tap Other and type it in. 
But you might sometimes want to see the complete list of available 
hotspots—maybe because the iPad-suggested hotspot is flaky. To see the 
full list, from the Home screen, open SettingsÆWi-Fi. Tap the one you 
want to join, as shown on the facing page.
Tip: Tap * next to your current hotspot’s name to view an info sheet for 
techies. It shows your IP address, subnet mask, router address, and 
other delicious stats. Even mere mortals, however, will sometimes 
enjoy the Forget this Network button. It removes this hotspot from 
the list, which is handy if you’ve moved away and don’t need to be 
reminded of the high speed that was once yours.
Commercial Hotspots
Tapping the name of the hotspot you want to join is generally all you have 
to do—if it’s a home WiFi network. Unfortunately, joining a commercial 
WiFi hotspot—one that requires a credit card number—requires more than 
just connecting to it. You also have to sign into it.
In general, the iPad prompts you to do that automatically. A big login screen 
pops up on its own, interrupting whatever you’re doing; that’s where you 
supply your credit card information or (if you have a membership to this 
WiFi chain, like Boingo or T-Mobile) your name and password. Tap Submit 
or Proceed, try not to contemplate the cost, and enjoy your surfing. 
(If that login screen doesn’t appear, or if you canceled out of it accidentally, 
open Safari. You’ll see the “Enter your payment information” screen, either 
immediately or as soon as you try to open a Web page of your choice.)
Mercifully, the iPad memorizes your password. The next time you use this 
hotspot, you won’t have to enter it again.

Airplane Mode and WiFi Off Mode
In Airplane mode, you turn off all wireless circuitry: Bluetooth, WiFi, and 
(if you have it) cellular. Now you can’t get onto the Internet. You’re saving 
power, however, and complying with airline regulations.
The short way to turn it on: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen; on 
the Control Center, tap | so it turns white. (The long way: Open Settings, 
turn on Airplane Mode.)
In Airplane mode, anything that requires Internet access—text messages, 
Web, email, apps—triggers a message: “Turn off Airplane Mode or use WiFi 
to access data.” Tap either OK (to back out of your decision) or Settings 
(to turn off Airplane mode and get online). 
You can, however, enjoy all the other iPad features: Music, Camera, and so 
on. You can also work with stuff you’ve already downloaded to the phone, 
like email and Web pages you’ve saved in the Reading List.
On the same Control Center, you can also turn WiFi and Bluetooth on and 
off independently. An iPad is perfectly OK to use on flights—even during 
takeoff and landing in the U.S.—with WiFi and Bluetooth turned on. (It’s 
the cellular circuitry, on the cellular iPad, that must be turned off in flight.)
Personal Hotspot (Tethering)
Tethering means using a cellphone as an Internet antenna for gadgets that 
don’t have cellular built in, like laptops, iPod Touches, game consoles, and 
WiFi iPads. The phone gets online using the cellular network and shares 
its connection over a personal WiFi hotspot. (Which is why Apple calls its 
tethering feature Personal Hotspot.)
Basically, your cellphone connects to the Internet with its cellular con-
nection—and converts that signal into WiFi, as this diagram more or less 
makes clear.

Getting Online
347
In fact, several gadgets can share the phone’s connection simultaneously. 
Your phone becomes a personal cellular router, like a MiFi.
But here’s what’s wild: A cellular iPad can be a hotspot, too. You could 
replace the iPhone in the diagram above with a cellular iPad.
In short, tethering might make your life on the road easier in two ways:
• If you have a WiFi-only iPad, you can get online if an iPhone or 
another phone has Personal Hotspot (tethering) turned on. 
• If you have a cellular iPad, it can serve as the conduit to the Internet 
for your laptop—or other people’s laptops or WiFi iPads. 
Apple’s execution of this feature is especially nice. For example, the hotspot 
shuts itself off 90 seconds after the last laptop disconnects. That’s hugely 
important, because a personal hotspot is a merciless battery drain.
The hotspot feature may cost, say, $20 a month extra on your cellphone 
plan, or it may be included in your plan. Either way, beware of the monthly 
data limit. You’re sharing it among more devices now. It can go quickly, and 
the overage charges can be steep.
To get this feature, you have to sign up for it by calling your cell company 
or visiting its Web site (if you didn’t already do that when you signed up 
for service).

Turning On the Hotspot
On the phone or cellular iPad, open SettingsÆCellularÆPersonal Hotspot 
(or tell Siri, “Open cellular settings”). Turn Personal Hotspot On.
Tip: Once you’ve used Personal Hotspot for the first time, you won’t 
have to drill down as far to get to it. A new Personal Hotspot item 
appears right there on the main Settings screen from now on.
You have to use a password for your personal hotspot; it’s to ensure that 
people sitting nearby can’t surf using your connection and run up your cell 
bill. The software proposes a password, but you can edit it and make up 
one of your own. (It has to be at least eight characters long and contain 
letters, numbers, and punctuation. Don’t worry—your laptop or other WiFi 
gadget can memorize it for you.)
Connecting via WiFi
After about 15 seconds, the name of the cellular device (iPhone or cellular 
iPad) shows up as though it’s any other WiFi network. 
On your computer or WiFi iPad, choose that name from the ∑ menu. 
Enter the password, and bam—you’re now online. On the Mac or a WiFi-
only iPad, the ∑ changes to look like this: Ó.
You can leave the iPhone or iPad put away while connected. You’ll surf 
away on your laptop, baffling every Internet-less soul around you. Your 
laptop can now use email, the Web, chat programs—anything it could do 
in a real WiFi hotspot (just a little slower).
A blue bar appears at the top of the iPhone or cellular iPad’s screen to 
make you aware that other gadgets are connected; in fact, it shows how 
many are connected at the moment. (You can tap that bar to open the 
Personal Hotspot screen in Settings.) 

Getting Online
349
Most carriers won’t let more than five people connect through a single cel-
lular device, though.
Instant Hotspot
If all your gadgets are made by Apple, you get extra perks. Now, when you 
want your laptop to get online, you don’t have to wake your iPhone or cel-
lular iPad, unlock it, open Settings, and turn on Personal Hotspot.
Instead, its name appears in 
your laptop’s ∑ menu all the 
time, ready for choosing—even 
if the phone or iPad is asleep 
and locked, and even if Personal 
Hotspot is turned off! Handily 
enough, the ∑ menu also shows 
the battery and signal status of 
your iPhone or cellular iPad.
When your Mac or WiFi iPad is online through your cellular connection, it 
tries to save you money by suspending data-intensive jobs like full back-
ups and software updates. And it closes down the connection when you 
no longer need it, to save your cellular gadget’s battery.
All of this works only if the gadgets both have Bluetooth turned on and 
are signed into the same iCloud account. The Mac has to be running OS X 
Yosemite; the touchscreen gadgets need iOS 8.1.
The Cellular iPad
A cellular iPad costs $130 more than a WiFi-only iPad. And you have to pay 
for cellular service, which costs from $10 to $400 a month, depending on 
how many gigabytes of data you want to burn through. 
But the beauty of a cellular iPad is, of course, that you can use it outside 
WiFi hotspots. On the road. At the beach, in the car, on the mountain.
Tip: There’s one exception to that “you have to pay to use cellular” bit. 
If you bought your iPad from T-Mobile, you get 200 megabytes 
a month of free cellular service, forever. That’s not tons, but it’s 
enough for email checks and a few Web visits each month, and of 
course you can always buy more if you need it.
It may be a strange concept at first: Even though it may have cellular ser-
vice, the iPad is not a phone. It doesn’t get onto the cellular voice net-
work—only onto the cellular data network. 

Chapter 11
350
Cellphone carriers (Verizon, AT&T, and so on) maintain separate networks 
for voice and Internet data—and every year, they spend billions of dol-
lars trying to make those Internet networks faster. Over the years, they’ve 
come up with data networks like these: 
• Old, slow cellular network. The earliest, slowest cellular Internet con-
nections were called things like EDGE (AT&T) or 1xRTT (Verizon and 
Sprint). The good part is that these networks are almost everywhere, 
so a cellular iPad can get online almost anywhere you can make a 
phone call. You’ll know when you’re on one of these slow networks 
because your status bar bears a symbol like G or ˝.
The bad news is that it’s slow. Dog slow—dial-up slow. 
• 3G cellular networks. The world wasn’t happy with those slow net-
works, so the carriers spent several years building faster systems 
called 3G networks. (3G stands for “third generation.” The ancient 
analog cellphones were the first generation; EDGE-type networks 
were the second.) Geeks refer to the 3G network standard by its offi-
cial name: HSDPA, for High-Speed Downlink Packet Access. 
Web pages that take 2 minutes to appear using EDGE or 1xRTT show 
up in about 20 seconds on 3G. Email downloads much faster, espe-
cially when there are attachments.
• 4G networks. AT&T enhanced HSDPA, made it faster using a tech-
nology called HSPA+ (High-Speed Packet Access), and calls it 
4G. (You’ll know when you’re on one; your status bar says 4.) But 
nobody else recognizes HSPA+ as real 4G, which is why AT&T feels 
fine advertising “the nation’s largest 4G network.” The other carriers 
aren’t even measuring that network type.
• 4G LTE networks. Now this is 4G. 
An LTE network (Long-Term Evolution), offered in major cities by all 
four carriers, gives you amazing speeds—in some cases, faster than 
your broadband Internet at home. When your status bar says 9, it’s 
fantastic.
But LTE is not all sunshine and bunnies; it has two huge downsides.
First: coverage. LTE coverage is available in hundreds of U.S. cities, 
which is a good start. But that still leaves most of the country, includ-
ing huge chunks of several entire states, without any 4G coverage at 
all.
Verizon covers the most cities; AT&T has about half as many; Sprint 
and T-Mobile have only a handful. Whenever you’re outside the high-
speed areas, your iPad falls back to the slower speeds.

Getting Online
351
The second big problem with LTE is that, to receive its signal, a 
phone’s circuitry uses a lot of power.
You’ll always know which kind of network you’re on, thanks to the icons 
on the status bar: You’ll see either ∑ for WiFi, or one of the cellular icons 
(G, ˝, 3, 4, or 9). 
Or “No service” if there’s nothing available at all.
Note: The iPad connects to the cellular network only if it can’t find a 
WiFi hotspot to join.
And how much faster is one than the next? Well, network speeds are mea-
sured in kilobits and megabits per second (which isn’t the same as the 
more familiar kilobytes and megabytes per second; divide by 8 to get 
those).
The EDGE/1xRTT network is supposed to deliver data from 70 to 200 
kbps, depending on your distance from the cell towers. 3G gets 300 to 
700 kbps. A WiFi hotspot can spit out 650 to 2,100 kbps. And 4G LTE 
can deliver speeds as fast as 100 Mbps on the iPad Air 2. You’ll rarely get 
speeds near the high ends—but even so, you can see that there’s quite a 
difference. 
The bottom line: LTE and WiFi are awesome. EDGE/1xRTT—not so much.
Tip: You sometimes might want to turn off WiFi, but leave cellular on. 
Why? Because sometimes, the iPad bizarrely won’t get online at all. 
It’s struggling to use a WiFi network that, for one reason or another, 
isn’t connecting to the Internet. By turning WiFi off, you force the 
iPad to use its cell connection—which may be slower, but at least it 
works!
Signing Up for Service
You can thank Steve Jobs for this one: He negotiated with the cellular car-
riers to offer à la carte cell service for the cellular iPad. You don’t have to 
sign up for a two-year contract, as you would with a cellphone. You can 
buy a month here, a month there. 
When you want to order some, open SettingsÆCellularÆSet Up Cellular 
Data; choose the plan you want. Depending on how you bought your iPad, 
you may even be able to switch plans and carriers from time to time (page 
25).

Chapter 11
352
Twitter and Facebook
Twitter, of course, is a free service (sign up at twitter.com) that lets you 
send out short messages, like text messages, to anyone who wants to get 
them from you. On Twitter, people spread news, links, thoughts, and obser-
vations directly to the people who care—incredibly quickly. And Facebook 
is—well, Facebook. 1.3 billion people sharing their personal details and 
thoughts can’t be wrong, right?
These services are woven into the built-in iPad apps.
In SettingsÆTwitter or SettingsÆFacebook, enter your account name and 
password or sign up for an account. Here, too, you’re offered the chance 
to download the Twitter or Facebook apps. You can also tap Update 
Contacts, which adds the Twitter or Facebook addresses of everybody in 
your Contacts app to their information cards. .
Once you’ve set up Twitter and Facebook this way, you’ll find some nifty 
buttons built into your other apps, for one-tap tweeting or Facebook post-
ing. For example, the Share button (P) appears in Photos, Maps, Safari, 
and other apps, making it easy to post a photo, location, or Web page. Siri 
understands commands like “Tweet” and “Post to Facebook,” too, so you 
can broadcast when the spirit moves you.
In each case, you wind up at a small tweet sheet or Facebook sheet. Here 
you can add a comment to the link or photo, or attach your current loca-
tion, or (for Facebook) specify who’s allowed to see this post. 
For Twitter posts, the keyboard at that point offers dedicated @ and # 
keys. (The # is for creating hashtags—searchable keywords on a tweet like 
#iPad4bugs—that Twitter fans can use when searching for tweets about 
certain topics. And the @ precedes every Twitter person’s address—@
pogue, for example.)

The Web
353
12
T
he iPad’s Web browser is Safari, a version of the same one that 
comes on every iPhone and every Mac. It’s fast, simple to use, 
and very pretty indeed. In iOS 8, Safari gains a handful of slick 
new features (take a picture of your credit card, anyone?). Safari on the 
iPad is still not quite as good as surfing the Web on, you know, a laptop. 
But it’s getting closer.
Safari Tour
Safari has most of the features of a desktop Web browser: bookmarks, 
autocomplete (for Web addresses, account names, passwords, and credit 
cards), scrolling shortcuts, cookies, a pop-up ad blocker, password memo-
rization, and so on. (It’s missing niceties like streaming music, Java, Flash, 
and other plug-ins.)
Tip: You don’t have to wait for a Web page to load entirely. You can 
zoom in, scroll, and begin reading the text even when only part of 
the page has appeared.
Now, don’t be freaked out: The main screen elements disappear shortly 
after you start reading a page. That’s supposed to give you more screen 
space to do your surfing. To bring them back, tap the Web site name at the 
top of the screen. Or scroll to the top, scroll to the bottom, or just scroll up 
a little. At that point, here are the controls, as they appear from the top left:
• ”, ’ (Back, Forward). Tap ” to revisit the page you were just on. 
Once you’ve tapped ”, you can then tap ’ to return to the page you 
were on before you tapped the ” button.
The Web

Chapter 12
354
Tip: Since these buttons disappear as soon as you scroll down a page, 
how are you supposed to move back and forward among pages?
By swiping in from outside the screen. Start your swipe on the edge 
of the iPad’s front glass and whisk inward. Swiping rightward like 
this means “back”; leftward means “forward again.” Do it slowly, and 
you can actually see the page sliding in.
•  ‡ (Bookmarks). This button brings up your list of saved book-
marks—and much more. Here, too, are your History list, your Favorites, 
your Reading List, and links recommended by the people you follow 
on Twitter. You can read about these elements later in this chapter.
• Search/address bar. In iOS, a single, unified box serves as both the 
address bar and the search bar at the top of the screen. (That’s the 
trend these days. Desktop-computer browsers like Chrome and Safari 
on the Mac work that way, too.)
This box is where you enter the URL (Web address) for a page you 
want to visit. (“URL” is short for the even-less-self-explanatory Uni-
form Resource Locator.) For example, if you type amazon.com, tap-
ping Go takes you to that Web site.

The Web
355
But this is also where you search the Web. If you type anything else, 
like cashmere sweaters or just amazon, tapping Go gives you the 
Google search results for that phrase.
In general, it’s handy to have a combined address bar/search bar. Un-
fortunately, it means that you can no longer leave off the .com when 
you’re typing an address—a longtime advantage of Safari’s smart 
address bar.
Tip: If you hold your finger down briefly on the standard keyboard’s 
period key, you get a pop-up palette of Web-address suffixes (.org, 
.edu, and so on). Luckily, .com starts out selected—so just release 
your finger to type it in. In other words, the entire process for typing 
in .com goes like this: Hold finger on period key; release.
• g (Reader view). In this delightful view, all the ads, boxes, banners, 
and other junk disappear. Only text and pictures remain, for your 
sanity-in-reading pleasure. See page 374.
• X, ƒ (Stop, Reload). Tap x to interrupt the downloading of a Web 
page you’ve just requested (if you’ve made a mistake, for instance, or 
if it’s taking too long). 
Once a page has finished loading, the x button turns into a ƒ (re-
load) button. Click it if a page doesn’t look or work quite right. Safari 
re‑downloads the Web page and reinterprets its text and graphics. 
• n (New tab). In iOS 8, Safari can open multiple Web pages in the 
form of tabs, just as on a Mac or PC. (You can see them in the picture 
on the facing page.) The n button opens a new one.
• P (Share/Bookmark). When you’re on an especially useful page, tap 
this button. It offers every conceivable choice for commemorating the 
page: AirDrop, Mail, Message, Twitter, Facebook, Add Bookmark, Add 
to Reading List, Add to Home Screen, Copy, Print, and AirDrop. See 
page 279 for details.
• « (Page Juggler). Safari can keep multiple Web pages open, just like 
any other browser. Page 371 has the details.
Zooming and Scrolling
When you first open a Web page, you get to see the entire thing, so you 
can get the lay of the land.
At this point, of course, the type may be too small to read. So the next step 
is to magnify the part of the page you want to read. 

Chapter 12
356
The iPad offers three ways to do that:
• Rotate the iPad. Turn the device 90 degrees in either direction. The 
iPad rotates and magnifies the image to fill the wider view. Often, this 
simple act is enough to make tiny type big enough to read.
• Do the two-finger spread. Put two fingers on the glass and slide 
them apart. The Web page stretches before your very eyes, growing 
larger. Then you can pinch to shrink the page back down again. (Most 
people do several spreads or several pinches in a row to achieve the 
degree of zoom they want.)
• Double-tap. When you double-tap a block of text, Safari magnifies 
it, usually just enough to read easily. Double-tap again to zoom back 
out.
Once you’ve zoomed out to the proper degree, you can then scroll around 
the page by dragging or flicking with a finger. You don’t have to worry 
about “clicking a link” by accident; if your finger’s in motion, Safari ignores 
the tapping action, even if you happen to land on a link.
Tip: Once you’ve double-tapped to zoom in on a page, you can use this 
little-known trick: Double-tap anywhere on the upper half of the 
screen to scroll up or the lower half to scroll down. The closer you 
are to the top or bottom of the screen, the more you scroll.
Full-Screen Mode
On an iPad, the screen is pretty small to begin with; most people would 
rather dedicate that space to showing more Web.
So in iOS, Safari enters full-screen mode the instant you start to scroll 
down a page. In full-screen mode, all the controls and toolbars vanish. 
Now the entire iPad screen is filled with Web goodness, as shown on these 
pages. 
You can bring the controls back in any of these ways:
• Scroll up a little bit.
• Return to the top or bottom of a Web page.
• Tap the top strip.
• Navigate to a different page.
And enjoy Safari’s dedication to trying to get out of your way.

The Web
357
Typing a Web Address
As on a computer, this Web browser offers several tools for navigat-
ing the Web: the address bar, bookmarks, the History list, and good old 
link-tapping. These pages cover each of these methods in turn, along with 
the Reading List and Web Clips.
The address/search bar is the strip at the top of the screen where you type 
in a Web page’s address. And it so happens that five of the iPad’s great-
est tips and shortcuts all have to do with this important navigational tool:
• Your favorites await. When you tap in the address bar or open a new 
tab, the icons of your bookmarked sites appear, to save you time.
• Insta-scroll to the top. You can jump directly to the address bar, no 
matter how far down a page you’ve scrolled, just by tapping the very 
top edge of the screen (the status bar).
• Don’t delete. There is a ˛ button at the right end of the address 
bar whose purpose is to erase the current address so you can type 
another one. (Tap inside the address bar to make it, and the keyboard, 
appear.) But the ˛ button is for suckers.

Chapter 12
358
Instead, whenever the address bar is open for typing, just type. 
Forget that there’s already a URL there. The iPad is smart enough to 
figure out that you want to replace that Web address with a new one.
• Don’t type http://www. You can leave that stuff out; Safari will supply 
it automatically. Instead of http://www.cnn.com, for example, just type 
cnn.com (or tap its name in the suggestions list) and hit Go. 
• Type .com, .net, .org, or .edu the easy way. Safari’s canned URL 
choices can save you four keyboard taps apiece. To see their secret 
menu, hold your finger down on the period key on the standard key-
board (previous page). Then tap the common suffix you want. (Or, if 
you want .com, just release your finger without moving it.)
Otherwise, this address bar works just like the one in any other Web 
browser. Tap inside it to make the keyboard appear. 
Tap the blue Go key when you’re finished typing the address. That’s your 
Enter key. (Or tap Cancel to hide the keyboard without “pressing Enter.”)
Searching in Safari
The address bar is also the search box. Just tap into it and type your search 
phrase (or speak it, using Siri).
To save you time and fiddling, Safari instantly produces a drop-down 
menu filled with suggestions that could spare you some typing—things it 
guesses you might be looking for. If you see the address you’re trying to 
type, then by all means tap it instead of typing out the rest of the URL. The 
time you save could be your own:
• Top Hits. The Top Hits are Safari’s best guesses at what you’re looking 
for. They’re the sites on your bookmarks and History lists that you’ve 
visited most often (and that match what you’ve typed so far).
Try tapping one of the Top Hits sometime. You’ll discover, to your 
amazement, that that site appears almost instantly. It doesn’t seem to 
have to load. That’s because, as a favor to you, Safari quietly down-
loads the Top Hits in the background, while you’re still entering your 
search term, all to save you time.
NOTE: If you’re concerned that this feature is sucking down some of 
your monthly cellular data allowance unnecessarily, you can turn 
it off in SettingsÆSafariÆPreload Top Hit.
• Google Search. The next category of suggestions: a list of search 
terms you might be typing, based on how popular those searches are 

The Web
359
on Google (or whatever search service you’re using). For example, 
if you type chick, this section proposes things like chicken recipes, 
chick fil a, and chicken pox. It’s just trying to save you a little typing; if 
none of these tappable choices is the one you want, then ignore them 
and continue typing.
NOTE: You can turn this feature off, too, if it makes you feel spied upon. 
(Behind the scenes, it’s transmitting your search term to Apple.) 
You do that in SettingsÆSafariÆSearch Engine Suggestions.
• Bookmarks and History. Here Safari offers matching selections from 
Web sites you’ve bookmarked or recently visited. Again, it’s trying to 
save you typing if it can.
• On This Page. Here’s how you search for certain text on the page 
you’re reading. 
Once you’ve started typing, under the On This Page heading, you see 
a listing called Find “chick” (or whatever you’ve typed so far), shown 
on the facing page at left. Tap that line to jump to the first appear-
ance of that text on the page; then use the ” and ’ buttons at the 
bottom to jump from one match to the next. Tap Done to return to 
your regularly scheduled browsing.

Chapter 12
360
Tip: Suppose you’ve started typing a search term. Safari pipes up with 
its usual list of suggestions. At this point, if you drag up or down the 
screen, you hide the keyboard—so you can see the suggestions that 
were hidden behind it.
Now then. If, among all of these Safari labor-saving suggestions, you don’t 
see what you’re looking for, then maybe you really do have to search the 
Web. Tap the big blue Go button in the corner. 
You can tell the iPad to use a Yahoo, Bing, or DuckDuckGo search instead 
of Google, if you like. From the Home screen, tap SettingsÆSafariÆSearch 
Engine. (DuckDuckGo, a new option in iOS 8, is a search service dedicated 
to your privacy. It doesn’t store your searches or tailor the results to you. 
On the other hand, it’s capable of searching only about 50 Web sources—
Wikipedia, Wolfram Alpha, and so on.)

The Web
361
Tip: If you’ve set your search options to use Google, there are all kinds 
of cool things you can type here—special terms that tell Google, “I 
want information, not Web page matches.”
You can type a movie name and Zip code or city/state (Titanic 
Returns 10024) to get a list of today’s showtimes in theaters near 
you. Get the forecast by typing weather chicago or weather 60609. 
Stock quotes: Type the symbol (AMZN). Dictionary definitions: 
define schadenfreude. Unit conversions: liters in 5 gallons. Currency 
conversions: 25 usd in euros. Then tap Go to get instant results.
Quick Website Search
This crazy, not fully baked feature, new in iOS 8, lets you search within a 
certain site (like Amazon or Reddit or Wikipedia) using only Safari’s reg-
ular search bar. For example, typing wiki mollusk can search Wikipedia 
for its entry on mollusks. Typing amazon ipad can offer links to buy an 
iPad from Amazon. Typing reddit sitcoms opens reddit.com to its search 
results for sitcoms.
None of this will work, however, until (a) you’ve turned the feature on 
(SettingsÆ​SafariÆQuick Website Search), and (b) you’ve manually taught 
Safari how to search those sites one time each.
To do that, pull up the site you want to search (let’s say it’s reddit.com) and 
use its regular search bar. Search for anything. 
That site’s name now appears in the list at SettingsÆSafariÆQuick Website 
Search. (Sometimes. Many sites don’t work with Quick Website Search.) 
From now on, you can search that site by typing, for example, reddit sit-
coms. You’ll jump directly to that site’s search results.
Bookmarks
Bookmarks, of course, are Web sites you might want to visit again without 
having to remember and type their URLs. 
To see the list of bookmarks on your iPad, tap ‡ at the top of the screen. 
You see the master list of bookmarks (next page, left). They’re organized 
in folders, or even folders within folders. 
Tapping a folder shows you what’s inside (next page, right), and tapping a 
bookmark begins opening the corresponding Web site.
NOTE: Actually, what you see when you tap ‡ are three tabs at the 
top: ‡ (Bookmarks), © (Reading List), and @ Twitter links 
and RSS feeds). The latter two are described later in this chapter.

Chapter 12
362
You might be surprised to discover that Safari already seems to be pre­
stocked with bookmarks—that, amazingly, are interesting and useful to 
you in particular! How did it know?
Easy—it copied your existing desktop computer’s browser bookmarks 
from Internet Explorer (Windows) or Safari (Mac) when you synced the 
iPad (Chapter 14), or when you turned on Safari syncing through iCloud. 
Sneaky, eh?
Creating New Bookmarks
You can add new bookmarks right on the iPad. Any work you do here is 
copied back to your computer the next time you sync the two machines—
or instantaneously, if you’ve turned on iCloud bookmark syncing.

The Web
363
When you find a Web page you might like to visit again, tap P to reveal 
the options shown at left (facing page); then tap Add Bookmark. The Add 
Bookmark screen appears (right). 
You have two tasks here:
• Type a better name. In the top box, you can type a shorter or clearer 
name for the page. Instead of “Bass, Trout & Tackle—the Web’s 
Premier Resource for the Avid Outdoorsman,” you can just call it 
“Fish.”
The box below this one identifies the underlying URL, which is inde-
pendent of what you’ve named your bookmark. You can’t edit this 
one.
• Specify where to file this bookmark. If you tap Favorites >, you open 
Safari’s hierarchical list of bookmark folders, which organize your 
bookmarked sites. Tap the folder where you want to file the new 
bookmark so you’ll know where to find it later.
TIP: You can specify which folder you want Safari to propose when you 
save a new bookmark—handy if you have a lot of those folders. You 
set that up in SettingsÆSafariÆFavorites.
Editing Bookmarks and Folders
It’s easy enough to massage your Bookmarks list within Safari—to delete 
favorites that aren’t so favorite anymore, to make new folders, to rearrange 
the list, to rename a folder or a bookmark, and so on. 
The techniques are the same for editing bookmark folders as editing the 
bookmarks themselves—after the first step. To edit the folder list, start by 
opening the Bookmarks (tap ‡), and then tap Edit. 
To edit the bookmarks themselves, tap ‡, tap a folder, and then tap Edit. 
Now you can get organized:
• Delete something. Tap – next to a folder or a bookmark, and then 
tap Delete to confirm.
• Rearrange the list. Drag the grip strip (˝) up or down in the list to 
move the folders or bookmarks around. (You can’t move or delete the 
top two folders—Favorites and History.)
• Edit a name and location. Tap a folder or a bookmark name. If you 
tap a folder, you arrive at the Edit Folder screen; you can edit the 
folder’s name and which folder it’s inside of. If you tap a bookmark, 
Edit Bookmark lets you edit the name and the URL it points to. 

Chapter 12
364
Tap Done when you’re finished.
• Create a folder. Tap New Folder in the lower-left corner of the Edit 
Folders screen. You’re offered the chance to type a name for it and to 
specify where you want to file it (that is, in which other folder).
Tap Done when you’re finished. 
The Reading List
The Reading List is a handy list of Web pages you want to read later. Unlike 
a bookmark, it stores entire pages, so you can read them later even when 
you don’t have an Internet connection (on the subway or on a plane, for 
example).
The Reading List also keeps track of what you’ve read. You can use the 
Show All/Show Unread button at the bottom of the panel to view every-
thing—or just what you haven’t yet read. 
Tip: To make matters even sweeter, iCloud synchronizes your Reading 
List with your Mac, iPhone, and so on—as long as you’ve turned on 
bookmark syncing. It’s as though the Web always keeps your place.
To add a page to the Reading List, tap P and then tap Add to Reading 
List. 

The Web
365
Once you’ve added a page to the Reading List, you can get to it by tap-
ping ‡ and then tapping the Reading List tab at the top (©). Tap an 
item on your list to open and read it.
Tip: When you get to the bottom of a Reading List item, keep scrolling 
down. The iPad is nice enough to offer up the next article in your 
Reading List, as though they were all vertically connected.
Shared Links ()
There’s a third tab button on the Bookmarks screen, too: €. It’s the Shared 
Links button. It lists every tweet from Twitter that contains a link. The idea 
is to make it easier for you to explore sites that your Twitter friends are rec-
ommending; all their Web finds are collected in one place.
Tip: In Safari, “shared links” has another meaning, too: The P makes it 
easy to share the URL of a particularly juicy Web page. On the Share 
sheet, you get the usual set of links: Copy, Mail, Message (to send 
by text message), Twitter, Facebook, and so on. But remember that 
iOS 8 is extensible. Depending on the apps you’ve installed, you may 
see all kinds of other share-this-link options on this screen.

Chapter 12
366
RSS Subscriptions
At the bottom of the Shared Links (€) tab, iOS 8 offers a new button 
called Subscriptions. It’s a reference to RSS feeds, which are something 
like subscriptions to Web sites. You don’t have to remember to go visit 
your favorite blogs or news sites; notification blurbs about their newly 
posted articles come to you.
Here’s the procedure:
1.	 In Safari, open a site that offers an RSS feed. News sites of all kinds 
offer RSS feeds (nytimes.com, usatoday.com, engadget.com, yahoo-
tech.com, and so on). 
2.	 Subscribe to it. To do that, tap ‡, then €, then Subscriptions, and 
then Add Current Site (previous page, left).
3.	 Read. When you want to see what’s new, tap ‡, then €. That’s right: 
Blurbs representing newly posted stories appear on the € tab (pre-
vious page, right), mixed in with all your Twitter links. That’s not ideal, 
especially if there are hundreds of Twitter links—but at least you’ll 
never be without a place to check for interesting stuff to read.
To delete a subscription, tap ‡, then €, then Subscriptions; tap – next 
to the subscription’s name, and confirm by tapping Delete.
Web Clips
If there’s a certain Web site you visit all the time, like every day, then 
even the four taps necessary to open it in the usual way (Home, Safari, 
Bookmarks, your site’s name) can seem like a lot of red tape. That’s why 
Apple made it simple to add the icon of a certain Web page right to your 
Home screen. It’s a shortcut that Apple calls a Web clip.
Start by opening the page in question. Tap P at the top of the screen. In 
the button list, tap Add to Home Screen. Now you’re offered the chance to 
edit the icon’s name; finally, tap Add.
When you return to your Home screen, you see the new icon. You’ve just 
added a bookmark to your Home screen. (You move or delete this icon 
exactly as you would any app.)

The Web
367
Tip: You can turn part of a Web page into one of these Web clips, 
too. You might want quick access to The New York Times’ “Most 
emailed” list, or the bestselling children’s books on Amazon, or the 
most-viewed video on YouTube, or the box scores for a certain 
sports league. 
All you have to do is zoom and scroll the page in Safari before you 
tap P, isolating the section you want. Later, when you open the 
Web clip, you’ll see exactly the part of the Web page you wanted.
The History List
Behind the scenes, Safari keeps track of the Web sites you’ve visited in 
the past week or so, neatly organized into subfolders like This Evening 
and Yesterday. It’s a great feature when you can’t recall the address for 
a Web site you visited recently—or when you remember it had a long, 
complicated address and you get the psychiatric condition known as iPad 
Keyboard Dread.
To see the list of recent sites, tap ‡; then, on the ‡ tab, tap History, whose 
icon bears a h to make sure you know it’s special. Once the History list 
appears, just tap a bookmark to revisit that Web page.
Erasing the History List
Some people find it creepy that Safari maintains a complete list of every 
Web site they’ve seen recently, right there in plain view of any family mem-
ber or coworker who wanders by. They’d just as soon their wife/hus-
band/boss/parent/kid not know what Web sites they’ve been visiting. 
You can delete just one particularly incriminating History listing easily 
enough; swipe leftward across its name and then tap Delete. Or you can 
delete the entire History menu, thus erasing all your tracks. To do that, tap 
Clear; confirm by tapping Clear History. You can also clear only the names 
of the sites you’ve seen in the past hour, today, or today and yesterday.
You’ve just rewritten History.
Tapping Links
On the iPad, not all links take you to other Web pages. If you tap an email 
address, it opens up the Mail app (Chapter 13) and creates a preaddressed 
outgoing message. There’s even such a thing as a map link, which opens 
the Maps app.

Chapter 12
368
Each of these links, in other words, takes you out of Safari. If you want to 
return to your Web browsing, then you have to return to the Home screen, 
or the app switcher, and tap Safari. The page you had open is still there, 
waiting.
Tip: If you hold your finger on a link for a moment—touching rather than 
tapping—a handy panel appears (above). At the top, you see the full 
Web address that link will open. And there are some useful buttons: 
Open, Open in New Tab, Add to Reading List, and Copy (meaning 
“copy the link address”). 
Saving Graphics
If you find a picture online that you wish you could keep forever, you have 
two choices. You could stare at it until you’ve memorized it, or you could 
save it.
To do that, touch the image for about a second. A sheet appears, just like 
the one that appears when you hold your finger down on a regular link.
If you tap Save Image, then the iPad thoughtfully deposits a copy of the 
image in your Camera Roll, so it will get backed up and copied to your Mac 
or PC. If you tap Copy, then you nab a link to that graphic, which you can 
now paste into another program. 

The Web
369
Saved Passwords and Credit Cards
On desktop Web browsers, a feature called AutoFill saves you an awful 
lot of typing. It fills out your name and address automatically when you’re 
ordering something online. It stores your passwords so you don’t have to 
re-enter them every time you visit passworded sites.
But on the iPad, where you’re typing on glass, the convenience of AutoFill 
goes to a whole new level.
And in iOS, there’s a whole new level above that level. The iPad can mem-
orize your credit card information, too, making it much easier to buy stuff 
online; in fact, it can even store this information by taking a picture of your 
credit card.
And thanks to iCloud syncing, all those passwords and credit cards can 
auto-store themselves on all your other Apple gadgetry. 
To turn on AutoFill, visit SettingsÆSafariÆPasswords & AutoFill. Here’s 
what you find (previous page, top):
• Use Contact Info. Turn this On. Then tap My Info. From the address 
book, find your own listing. You’ve just told Safari which name, 
address, city, state, Zip code, and phone number belong to you.

Chapter 12
370
From now on, whenever you’re asked to input your address, phone 
number, and so on, you’ll see an AutoFill button at the top of the key-
board. Tap it to make Safari auto-enter all those details, saving you no 
end of typing. (It works on most sites.) If there are extra blanks that 
AutoFill doesn’t fill, then you can tap the Previous and Next buttons 
to move your cursor from one to the next instead of tapping and 
scrolling manually.
• Names & Passwords lets Safari fill in your user name and passwords 
when you visit sites that require you to log in (Google, Amazon, and 
so on). On each Web site, you’ll be able to choose Yes (a good idea 
for your PTA or library account), Never for this Website (a good idea 
for your bank), or Not Now (you’ll be asked again next time).
You can also tap Saved Passwords to view a list of the memorized 
names and passwords—after entering your iPad password.
Tip: On this screen, you can delete saved passwords. Swipe leftward 
across the login that no longer pleases you, and then tap Delete.
• Credit Cards. Turn on Credit Cards, of course, if you’d like Safari to 
memorize your charge card info. To enter your card details, tap Saved 
Credit Cards (where you see a list of them) and then Add Credit 
Card. You can type in your name, card number, expiration date, and a 
description—or you can save yourself a little tedium by tapping Use 
Camera. Aim the camera at your credit card until you see its long 
number magically recognized, as you can see here. (You still have to 
enter your name and the card expiration manually.)
When you buy something online, iOS offers an Autofill Credit Card 
button. When you tap it, Safari asks you first which credit card you 
want to use, if you’ve stored more than one (it displays the last four 

The Web
371
digits for your reference). Tap it, and boom: Safari cheerfully fills in the 
credit card information, saving you time and hassle.
Unfortunately, there’s nowhere to store the little three- or four-digit 
security code, sometimes called the CSC, CVV, or CV2 code. Safari 
makes no attempt to fill that in; you always have to enter it manually. 
That’s one last safeguard against a kid, a spouse, a parent, or a thief 
using your iPad for an online shopping spree when you’re not around.
Tip: Once you’ve stored all of these passwords and credit cards, it sure 
would be nice if you didn’t have to enter them into other Apple 
gadgets, wouldn’t it? Your Mac, your iPhone, and so on?
Fortunately, the iCloud service can synchronize this information to 
Safari running on other Apple machines. Page 437 has the details.
Manipulating Multiple Pages
Like any other self-respecting browser, Safari can keep multiple pages 
open at once, making it easy for you to switch among them. You can think 
of it as a miniature version of tabbed browsing, a feature of browsers like 
Safari Senior, Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. Tabbed browsing 
keeps a bunch of Web pages open simultaneously. 
One advantage of this arrangement is that you can start reading one Web 
page while the others load into their own tabs in the background.
To Open a New Window
Tap the n button at top right. 
You now arrive at the Favorites page (below). Here are icons for all the 
sites you’ve designated as Favorites. Tap to open one. Or, in the address 
bar, enter an address. Or use a bookmark. (More on Favorites in a moment.) 

Chapter 12
372
Tip: Alternatively, hold your finger down on a link instead of tapping it. 
You get a choice of three commands, one of which is Open in New 
Page. 
Sometimes Safari sprouts a new window automatically when you 
click a link. That’s because the link you tapped is programmed to 
open in a new window. To return to the original window, read on.
To Switch among Windows
Tap « at top right. Now you see something like the thumbnail pages 
shown here. These, of course, are all your open windows. You work with 
them like this:
• Close a window by tapping the x in the corner—or by swiping a 
page away to the left. It slides away into the void; the only thing miss-
ing is a falling sound effect like, “Oh noooooooooooooo!”
• Rearrange these windows by dragging them up or down with your 
finger. (Pause briefly with your finger down before moving it.)
• Open a window to full screen by tapping it.

The Web
373
You can open a third window, and a fourth, and so on, and jump among 
them, using these two techniques.
iCloud Tabs
The iPad can auto-open whatever browser windows and tabs you had 
open on another Apple gadget, like a Mac or an iPhone. Thanks to the mir-
acle of iCloud syncing, the last windows and tabs you had open on that 
other gadget (even if the gadget is turned off) show up here. 
The concept is to unify your Macs and i-gadgets into one glorious, seam-
less Web-browsing experience. You’re reading three browser windows and 
tabs on your iPad—why not resume on a bigger screen when you get 
home and sit down in front of your Mac?
You won’t see these tabs unless the Macs have OS X Mountain Lion or later. 
And, of course, Safari has to be turned on in System PreferencesÆiCloud 
on the Mac, or SettingsÆiCloud on the iPad or tablet.
To see these tabs, tap « to open your view of open Safari window thumb-
nails. Scroll to the bottom (facing page). There they are: your iCloud tabs, 
sorted into headings that correspond to your other Apple gadgets. Tap to 
open.
The Favorites Page
You can never close all your Safari windows. The app will never let you get 
past the final page: the Favorites page (facing page).
This is the new starting point. It’s what you first see when you tap the n 
button. It’s like a page of visual bookmarks.
In fact, if you see a bunch of icons here already, it’s because your iPad 
has synced them over from Safari on a Mac; whatever sites are on your 
Bookmarks bar become icons on this bookmark page.
You can edit this Favorites page, of course:
• Rearrange them as you would Home screen icons. That is, hold your 
finger down on an icon momentarily and then drag it to a new spot.
• Remove or rename a Favorites icon. Favorites are just bookmarks. So 
you can edit, move, or delete them just as you would any bookmark. 
(Tap ‡ to open your Bookmarks screen. Make sure that you’re on the 
‡ tab, so that your list of folders is showing. Tap Favorites, then Edit. 
Tap – for a site you want to delete, and then tap Delete.)

Chapter 12
374
TIP: You can create folders inside the Favorites folder, too. Whenever the 
Favorites screen appears, you’ll see these subfolders listed as further 
sources of speed-dial Web sites.
• Add a Favorites icon. When you find a page you’d like to add to the 
Favorites screen, tap P. On the Share sheet, tap Add Bookmark. The 
iPad usually proposes putting the new bookmark into the Favorites 
folder, which means that it will show up on the Favorites screen. (If it 
proposes some other folder on the Location line, then tap the folder’s 
name and then tap Favorites.) Tap Save.
TIP: It’s worth noting, by the way, that you don’t have to use the 
Favorites folder of bookmarks as the one whose contents appear 
on the Favorites screen. In SettingsÆSafariÆFavorites, a list of all 
your Bookmarks folders appears. Whichever one you select there 
becomes your new Favorites folder, even if its name isn’t “Favorites.”
Reader View
How can people read Web articles when there’s Times Square blinking all 
around them? Fortunately, you’ll never have to put up with that again. 
The Reader button in the address bar (g) is amazing. With one tap, it 
eliminates everything from the page you’re reading except the text and 
photos. No ads, toolbars, blinking, links, banners, promos, or anything else. 
The text is also changed to a clean, clear font and size, and the back-
ground is made plain white. Basically, it makes any Web page look like 
a printed book page, and it’s glorious. Shown here: the before and after. 
Which looks easier to read? 

The Web
375
To exit Reader, tap g again. Best. Feature. Ever.
The fine print: Reader doesn’t appear until the page has fully loaded. It 
doesn’t appear on “front page” pages, like the nytimes.com home page—
only when you’ve opened an article within. It may not appear on sites that 
are already specially designed for access by mobile gadgets, as described 
next. 
Open the Full Site
In an effort to conserve time and bandwidth (yours and theirs), many Web 
sites supply mobile versions to tablets and phones—smaller, stripped-
down sites that transfer faster than (but lack some features of) the full-
blown sites. You generally have no control over which version you’re sent.
Until now. Suppose you’re in Safari, and some site has dished up its mobile 
version, and you’re gnashing your teeth. Tap in the address box, and then 
swipe downward anywhere on the page. Tap Request Desktop Site. As 
you’ve requested, the full-blown desktop version of that site now appears.
Web Security 
Safari on the iPad isn’t meant to be a full-blown Web browser like the 
one on your desktop computer, but it comes surprisingly close—especially 
when it comes to privacy and security. Cookies, pop-up blockers, parental 
controls—they’re all here, for your paranoid pleasure.
Pop-Up Blocker
The world’s smarmiest advertisers like to inundate us with pop-up and 
pop-under ads—nasty little windows that appear in front of the browser 
window, or, worse, behind it, waiting to jump out the moment you close 
your window. Fortunately, Safari comes set to block those pop-ups so 
you don’t see them. It’s a war out there—but at least you now have some 
ammunition.

Chapter 12
376
The thing is, though, pop-ups are sometimes useful (and not ads)—notices 
of new banking features, seating charts on ticket-sales sites, warnings that 
the instructions for using a site have changed, and so on. Safari can’t tell 
these from ads—and it stifles them, too. So if a site you trust says “Please 
turn off pop-up blockers and reload this page,” then you know you’re 
probably missing out on a useful pop-up message.
In those situations, you can turn off the pop-up blocker. The on/off switch 
is in SettingsÆSafari.
Password Suggestions
When you’re signing up for a new account on some Web site, and you 
tap inside the box where you’re supposed to make up a password, Safari 
offers to make up a password for you. It’s a doozy, too, along the lines of 
23k2k4-29cs8-58384-ckk3322.
Now, don’t freak out. You’re not expected to remember that. Safari will, of 
course, memorize it for you (and sync it to your other Apple computers, 
if they’re on the same iCloud account). Meanwhile, you’ve got yourself a 
unique, nearly uncrackable password.
Cookies
Cookies are something like Web page preference files. Certain Web sites—
particularly commercial ones like Amazon.com—deposit them on your 
hard drive like little bookmarks so they’ll remember you the next time you 
visit. Ever notice how Amazon greets you with, “Welcome, Chris” (or what-
ever your name is)? It’s reading its own cookie, left behind on your hard 
drive (or in this case, on your iPad).
Most cookies are perfectly innocuous—and, in fact, are extremely useful, 
because they help Web sites remember your tastes. Cookies also spare 
you the effort of having to type in your name, address, and so on every 
time you visit these Web sites.
But fear is widespread, and the media fan the flames with tales of sinister 
cookies that track your movement on the Web. If you’re worried about 
invasions of privacy, Safari is ready to protect you. 
From the Home screen, tap SettingsÆSafariÆBlock Cookies. The options 
here are like a paranoia gauge. If you click Always Block, you create an 
acrylic shield around your iPad. No cookies can come in, and no cookie 
information can go out. You’ll probably find the Web a very inconvenient 
place; you’ll have to re-enter your information upon every visit, and some 
Web sites may not work properly at all. The Always Allow option means 
“Oh, what the heck—just gimme all of them.”

The Web
377
A good compromise is Allow from Websites I visit, which accepts cookies 
from sites you want to visit, but blocks cookies deposited on your iPad by 
sites you’re not actually visiting—cookies an especially evil banner ad gives 
you, for example.
The SettingsÆSafari screen also offers a Clear History and Website Data 
button. It deletes all the cookies you’ve accumulated so far, your browsing 
history, and your iPad’s cache. 
The cache is a patch of the iPad’s storage area where pieces of Web pages 
you visit—graphics, for example—are retained. The idea is that the next 
time you visit the same page, the iPad won’t have to download those bits 
again. It already has them on board, so the page appears much faster.
If you worry that your cache eats up space, poses a security risk, or is con-
fusing some page (and preventing the most recent version of the page 
from appearing), then tap Clear History and Website Data to erase it and 
start over.
Private Browsing
Private browsing lets you surf without adding any pages to your History 
list, searches to your Google search suggestions, passwords to Safari’s 
saved password list, or autofill entries to Safari’s memory. You might want 
to turn on private browsing before you start visiting Web sites that would 
raise interesting questions with your spouse, parents, or boss. 
When you want to start leaving no tracks, tap « to open the page-juggler 
screen; tap Private at the top-right corner.
Safari now points out that you’re in Private mode. Tap n to open a new 
page, and proceed as usual. From now on, Safari records nothing while 
you surf; the status bar at the top of the screen stays dark to remind you.
When you’re ready to browse “publicly” again, turn private browsing off 
once more (tap «, then tap Private to turn it off). Safari resumes taking 
note of the pages you visit—but it never remembers the ones you opened 
while in Private mode.
In other words, what happens in private browsing stays in private browsing.
Parental Controls
If your child (or employee) is old enough to have an iPad but not old 
enough for the seedier side of the Web, then don’t miss the Restrictions 
feature in Settings. The iPad makes no attempt to separate the good Web 
sites from the bad—but it can remove the Safari icon from the iPad alto-
gether so that no Web browsing is possible at all. See page 507 for 
instructions.


Email
379
13
E
mail on your iPad offers full formatting, fonts, graphics, 
and choice of type size; file attachments like Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, PDF, Pages, Numbers, photos, and even .zip com-
pressed files; and compatibility with Yahoo Mail, Gmail, AOL Mail, iCloud 
mail, corporate Exchange mail, and any standard email account. 
In iOS 8, the Mail app might well be called “Mail: The Anti-Annoyance 
App.” For example, new finger-swipes let you delete or flag messages; 
you can now flip between an email you’re writing and one you’re referring 
to; and with one tap on an outgoing message, you can request to be noti-
fied if anyone replies. 
Dude, if you want a more satisfying portable email machine than this one, 
buy a laptop.
This chapter covers the basic email experience. If you’ve gotten yourself 
hooked up with iCloud or Exchange ActiveSync, see Chapters 15 and 16 
for details.
Setting Up Your Account
In the olden days, setting up an email account on a new computer was a 
harrowing experience, requiring much typing of obscure codes and many 
calls to tech support.
These days, just typing in your email address and password might be all 
you have to do; it depends on what kind of email account you have.
Email

Chapter 13

Free Email Accounts
If you have a free email account from Google, AOL, Outlook, or Yahoo; an 
iCloud account (Chapter 15); or a Microsoft Exchange account run by your 
employer (Chapter 16), then setup on the iPad is easy.
From the Home screen, tap SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆAdd 
Account. Tap the colorful logo that corresponds to the kind of account 
you have (Google, Yahoo, or whatever).
Now you land on the account-information screen. Tap into each of the 
blanks and, when the keyboard appears, type the requested info: for 
example, your name, email address, account password, and a description 
(that one’s optional). Tap Next.
Now you may be shown the list of non-email data that the iPad can show 
you (from iCloud, Google, Yahoo, Exchange, and so on): Mail, Contacts, 
calendars, Reminders, and Notes. Turn off the ones you don’t want synced 
to your iPad, and then tap Save.
Your email account is ready to go!

Email
381
Tip: If you don’t have one of these free accounts, they’re worth having, 
if only as a backup to your regular account. They can help with 
spam filtering, too, since the iPad doesn’t offer any. To sign up, go to 
Google.com, Yahoo.com, AOL.com, or iCloud.com.
POP3 and IMAP Accounts
Those freebie, brand-name, Web-based accounts are super-easy to set up. 
But they’re not the whole ball of wax. Millions of people have more generic 
email accounts, perhaps supplied by their employers or Internet providers. 
They’re generally one of two types:
• POP accounts are the oldest and most compatible type on the 
Internet. (POP stands for Post Office Protocol, but this won’t be on 
the test.) A POP account can make life complicated if you check your 
mail on more than one machine (say, a PC and an iPad), as you’ll dis-
cover shortly.
A POP server transfers incoming mail to your computer or iPad 
before you read it, which works fine as long as you’re using only that 
machine to access your email. 
• IMAP accounts (Internet Message Access Protocol) are newer and 
have more features than POP servers, and they’re quickly putting POP 
out to pasture. IMAP servers keep all your mail online, rather than 
making you store it on your computer; as a result, you can access 
the same mail from any computer or iPad. IMAP servers remember 
which messages you’ve read and sent, and they even keep track of 
how you’ve filed messages into mail folders. (Those free Yahoo email 
accounts are IMAP accounts, and so are Apple’s iCloud accounts and 
corporate Exchange accounts. Gmail accounts can be IMAP, too.)
Tip: The iPad copies your IMAP messages onto the iPad itself, so you 
can work with your email even when you’re not online. You can, in 
fact, control where these messages are stored (in which mail folder). 
To see this, open SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆ[your IMAP 
account name]Æ[your IMAP account name again]ÆAdvanced. See? 
You can specify where your drafts, sent messages, and deleted 
messages wind up on the iPad.
The iPad can communicate with both kinds of accounts, with varying 
degrees of completeness.
If you haven’t opted to have your account-setup information transferred 
automatically to the iPad from your Mac or PC, then you can set it up man-
ually on the iPad. 

Chapter 13
382
Tap your way to SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆAdd Account. Tap 
Other, tap Add Mail Account, and then enter your name, email address, 
password, and an optional description. Tap Next.
Apple’s software attempts to figure out which kind of account you have 
(POP or IMAP) by the email address. If it can’t make that determination, 
then you arrive at a second screen, where you’re asked for such juicy 
details as the host name for incoming and outgoing mail servers. (This 
is also where you tap either IMAP or POP, to tell the iPad what sort of 
account it’s dealing with.)
If you don’t know this stuff offhand, you’ll have to ask your Internet pro-
vider, corporate tech-support person, or next-door teenager to help you. 
When you’re finished, tap Save.
To delete an account, open SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆ[account 
name]. At the bottom of the screen, you’ll find the Delete Account button.
Tip: You can make, rename, or delete IMAP or Exchange mailboxes (mail 
folders) right on the iPad, in the Mail app itself.
On the top-level Mailboxes list, under Accounts, tap your account’s 
name (iCloud, Gmail, or whatever). Tap Edit. Tap New Mailbox to 
create a new folder. To edit an existing mailbox, tap its name; you 
can then rename it, tap the Mailbox Location folder to move it, or 
tap Delete Mailbox. Tap Save to finish up.
Downloading Mail
If you have “push” email (Yahoo, iCloud, or Exchange), then your iPad 
doesn’t check for messages; new messages show up on your iPad as they 
arrive, around the clock. 
If you have any other kind of account, then the iPad checks for new mes-
sages automatically on a schedule—every 15, 30, or 60 minutes. It also 
checks for new messages each time you open the Mail program, or when-
ever you drag downward on the Inbox list. 
You can adjust the frequency of these automatic checks or turn off the 
“push” feature (because it uses up your battery faster) in Settings; see 
page 486.
When new mail arrives, you’ll know it at a glance; all the Notification Center 
options work well in Mail. For example, if your iPad is off, you can tap the 
Sleep or Home button to view the sender, subject, and the first line of the 
messages right on the Lock screen. (Swipe across one, right there on the 
Lock screen, to jump to it in Mail.)

Email
383
You’ll also hear the iPad’s little “You’ve got mail” sound, unless you’ve 
turned that off in Settings. 
If your iPad is on, then a new message can alert you by appearing briefly 
at the top of the screen, without disturbing your work. 
In iOS 8, in fact, you can actually process a message right from that ban-
ner. If you see at a glance that it’s junk, or if no response is necessary, drag 
your finger down on it to reveal two new buttons: Mark as Read (leave it in 
your inbox, no longer appearing as a new message) and Trash.
At the Home screen, Mail’s icon sprouts a circled number that tells you how 
many new messages are waiting. If you have more than one email account, 
it shows you the total number of new messages, from all accounts.
If you routinely leave a lot of unread messages in your inbox, and you don’t 
really care about this “badge,” you can turn it off. In fact, you can turn it off 
on a per-account basis, which is great if one of your accounts is sort of a 
junk account that you keep as a spare. Tap SettingsÆ​NotificationsÆ​MailÆ​
[account name]ÆBadge App Icon.)
In any case, once you know you have mail, tap Mail on the Home screen 
to start reading it.
The Mailboxes Pane
The pane down the left side of the Mail app is your starting point. It lists all 
your mail folders.

Chapter 13
384
When you’re holding the iPad horizontally (landscape mode), the Mailboxes 
pane is always at the left side of the screen. When you’re holding it verti-
cally (portrait), the Mailboxes pane is hidden until you swipe inward from 
the left edge of the screen (or tap the ” button at top left).
Either way, this panel is designed to be a series of nested lists. You start 
out seeing a list of accounts; tap one to see a list of folders; tap one for a 
list of messages; tap one to read the actual message on the main part of 
the screen.
To backtrack through these lists, tap the ” in the upper-left corner over 
and over again.

Email
385
The Unified Inbox
If you have more than one email address, you’re in luck. The iPad offers a 
unified inbox—an option that displays all the incoming messages from all 
your accounts in a single place. (If you don’t see it—if Mail opened up to 
some other screen—keep tapping ” , backing up a screen at a time, until 
you do.)
This Mailboxes page has two sections:
• Unified inboxes (and other unified folders). To see all the incoming 
messages in one unified box, tap All Inboxes. Below that, you see the 
Inboxes for each of the individual accounts.
This part of the main Mail list also offers unified folders for VIPs and 
Flagged messages, which are described below.
But what you may not realize is that you can add other unified folders 
to this section. You can, for example, add a folder called Unread, 
which contains only new messages from all accounts. (That’s not the 
same thing as All Inboxes, because your inbox can contain messages 
you have read but haven’t deleted or filed.)
You can also add a unified folder showing all messages where you 
were either the To or CC addressee; this folder won’t include any mail 
where your name appeared on the BCC (blind carbon-copy) line, like 
mailing lists and, often, spam.

Chapter 13
386
You can also add an Attachments folder here (messages with files 
attached), a Today folder, or unified folders that contain All Drafts, All 
Sent, or All Trash. (“All” means “from all accounts.”)
To hide or show these special uni-folders, tap Edit, and then tap the 
selection circles beside the names of the folders you want to appear. 
(You can also take this opportunity to drag them up or down into a 
pleasing sequence.) Tap Done.
• Accounts. Farther down the Mailboxes screen, you see your accounts 
listed again. Tap one to view the traditional mail folders: Inbox, Drafts 
(emails written but not sent), Sent, Trash, and any folders you’ve cre-
ated yourself (Family, Little League, Old Stuff, whatever), as shown on 
the previous page. If you have a Yahoo, iCloud, Exchange, or another 
IMAP account, then the iPad automatically creates these folders to 
match what you’ve set up online.
Note: Not all kinds of email accounts permit the creation of your own 
filing folders, so you might not see anything but Inbox, Sent, and 
Trash.
The Message List—and Threading
If you tap an inbox’s name, you wind up face to face with the list of incom-
ing messages. At first, you see only the subject lines of your messages, 
plus, in light-gray type, the first lines of their contents; that way, you can 
scan through new messages to see if there’s anything important. You can 
flick upward to scroll this list. Blue dots indicate messages you haven’t yet 
opened. 
Tap a message’s row to read it in all its formatted glory.
Here and there, you may spot a double arrow at the right side of the mes-
sage list, like this: ’’ That means you’re looking at some threaded mes-
sages. That’s where several related messages—back-and-forths on the 
same subject—appear only once, in a single, consolidated entry. The idea 
is to reduce inbox clutter and to help you remember what people were 
talking about.
When you tap a threaded message, the left-side pane lists the messages 
in the thread and tells you how many there are. Tap one of those to read, 
at last, the message itself.
Of course, this also means that to return to the inbox, you have more back-
tracking to do (tap ” twice). 
In general, threading is a nice feature, even if, from time to time, it acciden-
tally clumps in a message that has nothing to do with the others. 

Email
387
But if it bugs you, you can turn it off. Open SettingsÆMail, Contacts, 
Calendars, scroll down, and turn off Organize By Thread.
VIPs and Flagged Messages
You might notice, in your master Inbox, two “email accounts” that you 
didn’t set up: VIP and Flagged. They’re both intended to help you round 
up important messages from the thousands that flood you every day.
Each one magically rounds up messages from all your account inboxes, 
so you don’t have to go wading through lots of accounts to find the really 
important mail. (Note: That’s inboxes. Messages in other mail folders don’t 
wind up in these special inboxes, even if they’re flagged or are from VIPs.)
VIPs
In the real world, VIPs are people who get backstage passes to concerts or 
special treatment at business functions (it stands for “very important per-
son”). In iOS, it means “somebody whose mail is important enough that I 
want it brought to my attention immediately when it arrives.” 

Chapter 13
388
So who should your VIPs be? That’s up to you. Your spouse, your boss, and 
your doctor come to mind.
To designate someone as a VIP, proceed in either of these two ways:
• On the accounts screen, carefully tap the * next to the VIP item. 
Your master list of all VIPs appears (below). Tap Add VIP to choose a 
lucky new member from Contacts. 
This is also where you delete people from your VIP list when they’ve 
annoyed you. Swipe leftward across a name, and then tap Delete. Or 
tap Edit and then tap each – button; tap Delete to confirm.
Tip: You can set things up so that when a new message from a VIP 
comes in, the iPad lets you know with a sound, a banner, an alert 
bubble, and so on. Tap VIP Alerts to set them up. (That’s a shortcut 
to the SettingsÆ​NotificationsÆMailÆVIP screen.)
• In a message from the lucky individual, tap his name in the From, To, 
or Cc/Bcc box. His Contact screen appears, complete with an Add to 
VIP button.
Once you’ve established who’s important, lots of interesting things happen:
• The VIP inbox automatically collects messages from your VIPs. 
• VIP names in every mail list sprout a gray star.
• If you use iCloud, the same person is now a VIP on all your other 
iPads and iPads (running iOS 6 or later) and Macs (running OS X 
Mountain Lion or later).

Email
389
Tip: You can hide the VIP inbox on the main Mailboxes screen—handy if 
you don’t really use this feature. Tap Edit, and then tap l next to 
the VIP heading. Tap Done.
Flag It
Sometimes you receive email that prompts you to some sort of action, 
but you may not have the time (or the fortitude) to face the task at the 
moment. (“Hi there, it’s me, your accountant. Would you mind rounding 
up your expenses for 2002 through 2014 and sending me a list by email?”)
That’s why Mail lets you flag a message, summoning a little flag icon or a 
little orange dot in a new column next to the message’s name. (You can 
see the actual dot in the message below.) It can mean anything you like—it 
simply calls attention to certain messages. 
Tip: The flag marker can be either a f icon or an orange dot. You make 
your choice in SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆFlag Style.
To flag an open message, tap f above the message. When the confirma-
tion sheet opens (below), tap Flag.
Thanks to a new trick in iOS 8, you can also rapidly flag messages directly 
in a list (the Inbox, for example). Just swipe leftward across the message—
half an inch of finger-sliding does the trick—to reveal the set of buttons 
shown here:
Tap Flag. (If you tap More there, you get the option to Unflag.)
The dot or f icon appears in the body of the message, next to the mes-
sage’s name in your message list. (In this picture, the top dot looks more 
like a bull’s-eye; that’s because it’s flagged and unread.) The flag appears 

Chapter 13
390
even on the corresponding message in your Mac or PC email program, 
thanks to the miracle of wireless syncing. 
Finally, the Flagged mailbox appears in your list of accounts, making it 
easy to work with all flagged messages, from all accounts, in one place. 
Tip: If you don’t really use this feature, you can hide the Flagged 
folder. On the Inboxes panel, tap Edit, and then tap the l next to 
“Flagged” to turn it off. Tap Done.
What to Do with a Message
Once you’ve opened a message, you can respond to it, delete it, file it, and 
so on. Here’s the drill.
List View: Flag, Trash, Mark as Unread
In iOS 8, Apple has made it much faster and easier to plow through a seeth-
ing inbox, processing messages as you go, without ever having to open 
them. All you have to do is swipe across a message in the list horizontally.
• Full left-swipe delete. Swipe your finger leftward all the way across 
the message to delete it. That’s it: No confirmation tap required. 
• Partial left-swipe options. If you don’t swipe leftward all the way, 
you reveal a set of three buttons on the right: Trash (same as above, 
but now you have to tap again to confirm); Flag (described in the 
previous section); and More (opens up a raft of options like Reply, 
Forward, Flag, Move to Junk, and so on).
• Full right-swipe. Swipe your finger to the right all the way across the 
message to mark it as new (unread). Great for reminding yourself to 
look at this message again later. Or, if it’s already unread, that swipe 
marks it as read.

Email
391
To a certain extent, you can customize these gestures. You can turn off the 
right-swipe gesture. Or swap the positions of the Flag and Mark as Read 
options, for example, so that you flag a message when you swipe fully to 
the right and Mark as Read appears as a button when you swipe to the 
left. Or you can put the Archive button into the place of Flag when you 
swipe to the left.
To check out your options, open SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆSwipe 
Options (shown below).
Tap Swipe Left to specify which button appears in the center of the three 
when you swipe partway leftward None, Mark as Read, or Flag). Tap Swipe 
Right to choose which function you want to trigger with a full rightward 
swipe (None, Mark as Read, Flag, or Archive).
Read It
The type size in email messages can be pretty small. Fortunately, you have 
some great iPaddy enlargement tricks at your disposal. For example:
• Spread two fingers to enlarge the entire email message.
• Rotate the iPad 90 degrees. The text gets bigger.

Chapter 13
392
• Double-tap a narrow block of text to make it fill the screen, if it 
doesn’t already.
• Drag or flick your finger to scroll through or around the message.
• Choose a larger type size for all messages. See page 163.
Links are “live” in email messages. Tap a Web address to open it, a YouTube 
link to watch the video, an email address to write to it, a time and date to 
add it to your calendar, and so on.
Reply to It
To answer a message, tap the Reply/Forward icon (F) above the mes-
sage; tap Reply. If the message was originally addressed to multiple recip-
ients, then Reply All sends your reply to everyone simultaneously.
A new message window opens, already addressed. As a courtesy to your 
correspondents, Mail pastes the original message at the bottom of the 
window.
Tip: If you select some text before you tap, then the iPad pastes only 
that selected bit into the new, outgoing message. In other words, 
you’re quoting back only a portion—just the way it works on a full-
sized computer.
At this point, you can add or delete recipients, edit the subject line or the 
original message, and so on. When you’re finished, tap Send.
Use the Return key to create blank lines in the original message. (Use the 
loupe—page 57—to position the insertion point at the proper spot.)
Using this method, you can splice your own comments into the para-
graphs of the original message, replying point by point. The brackets by 
each line of the original message help your correspondent keep straight 
what’s yours and what’s hers.

Email
393
Forward It
Instead of replying to the sender, you may sometimes want to pass the 
note on to a third person. To do so, tap F. This time, tap Forward.
Tip: If there’s a file attached to the inbound message, the iPad says, 
“Include attachments from original message?” and offers Include 
and Don’t Include buttons. Rather thoughtful, actually—the iPad can 
forward files it can’t even open.
A new message opens, looking like the one that appears when you reply. 
You can precede the original message with a comment of your own, like, 
“Frank: I thought you’d be interested in this joke about your mom.” Finally, 
address and send it as usual.
Follow It
In iOS 8, your iPad can notify you when anyone responds to a certain email 
conversation. 
• If you’re composing or replying to a message, tap in the subject line 
to make the > appear; tap it. 
• If you’re reading a message, tap f above the screen; tap Notify Me; 
and confirm by tapping Notify Me again. 
• In a list, swipe leftward, partly across a message; tap More; tap Notify 
Me. 
In each case, a bell icon appears beside the message (or thread) in the list.
When anybody replies, a notification banner appears, ready for swiping 
and reading.

Chapter 13
394
Filing or Deleting One Message
Once you’ve opened a message that’s worth keeping, you can file it into 
one of your account’s folders (“mailboxes”) by tapping the a above the 
message. Up pops the list of your folders; tap the one you want.
It’s a snap to delete a message you no longer want, too. If it’s open in front 
of you, tap the T or ( button above the message. The message rapidly 
shrinks into the icon and disappears.
NOTE: If that one-touch Delete method makes you a little nervous, 
by the way, you can ask the iPad to display a confirmation box 
before trashing the message. Visit SettingsÆMail, Contacts, 
CalendarsÆ​Ask Before Deleting.
You can also delete a message from the message list—the inbox, for exam-
ple; see page 390.
Tip: Gmail doesn’t want you to throw anything away. That’s why swiping 
like this produces a button that says Archive, not Delete, and why 
the usual T button in a message looks like a filing box (. If you 
prefer to delete a message for good, hold down the ( until the 
Trash Message and Archive Message buttons appear. 
There’s a long way to delete messages from the list, too, as described next. 
But for single messages, the finger-swipe method is much more fun.
TIP: There’s a handy Undo shortcut, too: Shake the iPad lightly. Tap Undo 
Trash. The deleted message jumps back to the folder it just came 
from. (You can then shake again to undo the Undo!)

Email
395
Filing or Deleting Batches of Messages
You can also file or delete a bunch of messages at once. In the message 
list, tap Edit. A circle appears beside each message title. You can tap as 
many of these circles as you like, scrolling as necessary, adding a l with 
each touch. 
Finally, when you’ve selected all the messages in question, tap either Trash 
(Archive) or Move. 
If you tap Move, you’re shown the folder list so you can say where you 
want them moved. If you tap Trash, the messages disappear.
If you decide you’ve made a mistake, just shake the iPad lightly—the 
“Undo” gesture. Tap Undo Move to put the filed messages back where 
they just came from.
Note: When you delete a message, it goes into the Deleted folder. In 
other words, it works like the Macintosh Trash or the Windows 
Recycle Bin. You have a safety net.
Email doesn’t have to stay in the Deleted folder forever, though. 
You can ask the iPad to empty that folder every day, week, or 
month. From the Home screen, tap SettingsÆMail, Contacts, 
Calendars. Tap your account name and then AdvancedÆRemove. 
Now you can change the setting from “Never” to “After one day” 
(or week, or month).

Add the Sender to Contacts
When you get a message from someone new who’s worth adding to your 
iPad’s Contacts address book, tap that person’s name (in blue, on the 
From line). You’re offered buttons for Create New Contact and Add to 
Existing Contact. Use the second button to add an email address to an 
existing person’s “card.”
Open an Attachment
The Mail program downloads and displays the icons for any kind of attach-
ment—but it can open only documents from Microsoft Office (Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint), those from Apple iWork (Pages, Keynote, Numbers), 
PDFs, text, RTFs, VCFs, graphics, .zip files, and un-copy-protected audio 
and video files. 

Email
397
Just scroll down, tap the attachment’s icon, wait a moment for download-
ing, and then marvel as the document opens up, full screen. You can zoom 
in and out, flick, rotate the iPad 90 degrees, and scroll just as though it 
were a Web page or a photo.
Tip: If you hold your finger down on the attachment’s name, the Share 
sheet appears. It offers a list of ways you can send this attachment 
directly from your iPad to someone else (by AirDrop or Mail)—or to 
open it in other apps. 
If you tap a Word document, for example, you may be offered 
buttons for Mail, Dropbox, Evernote, and other apps that can open 
Word docs. If you tap a PDF document, you’ll see a button for Open 
in iBooks. (Quick Look means the same non-editable preview as 
you’d get with a quick tap.)
When you’re finished admiring the attachment, swipe rightward to return 
to the original email message.
Tip: iOS can handle the compressed folders known as ZIP files, just as 
Mac and Windows can. When you tap a .zip attachment’s icon, the 
first file in it opens up. At that point, though, if you tap a, you get 
a list of every document in that zipped folder. You can tap each to 
view or share it.
Snagging (or Sending) a Graphic
If you get sent a particularly good picture, just hold your finger still on 
it. You’re offered the Save sheet, filled with options like Save (into your 
Photo app’s Camera Roll), Copy, Print, and Assign to Contact (as a per-
son’s face photo). All the usual sending methods are represented here, too, 
so that you can fire off this photo via AirDrop, Messages, Mail, Twitter, and 
Facebook.
Snagging a Contact or a Date
iOS 8 can recognize contact information or calendar information from 
an incoming email message—and can dump it directly into Contacts or 
Calendar for you.
You’ll know when it’s found something—the block of contact information 
below somebody’s signature, for example—because you see a special gray 
banner at the top of the screen (facing page).
You can click Ignore if you don’t particularly need this person bulking 
up your address book. But if it’s somebody worth tracking, tap Add to 
Contacts. A new Contacts screen appears, ready to save.

Chapter 13
398
Similarly, if the message contains a reference to a date and time, the same 
sort of banner appears, offering to pop the appointment onto your calen-
dar. (This banner appears only when it’s really sure you’re being offered a 
date and time: e-invitations and airline-ticket confirmations, for example.)
iOS 8: Saving you time since 2014. 
View the To/From Details
When your computer’s screen is only seven or nine inches diagonal, there’s 
not a lot of extra space. So Apple designed Mail to conceal header details 
(To, From, and so on) that you might need only occasionally. For exam-
ple, you usually don’t actually see the word “From:”—you usually see only 
the sender’s name, in blue. The To and Cc lines may show only first names, 
to save space. (The on/off switch for that feature is in SettingsÆMail, 
Contacts, CalendarsÆ​Short Names.) And if there’s a long list of addresses, 
you may see only “Michael (& 15 more)”—not the actual list of names.
You get last names, full lists, and full sender labels when you tap More fol-
lowing the header information. 
Tap Hide to collapse these details.
Tip: When you tap a sender’s name in blue, you open the corresponding 
info card in Contacts. It contains one-touch buttons for calling 
someone back, sending a text message, or placing a FaceTime 
audio or video call—which can be very handy if the email message 
you just received is urgent.
Mark as Unread
In the inbox, any message you haven’t yet read is marked by a blue dot 
(∆). Once you’ve opened the message, the blue dot goes away.

Email
399
In iOS 8, if you slide your finger to the right across a message in the list, 
you trigger the Mark as Unread command—you make that blue dot reap-
pear. It’s a great way to flag a message for later, to call it to your own 
attention. The blue dot can mean “un–dealt with” instead of “unread.”
Move On
Once you’ve had a good look at a message and processed it to your sat-
isfaction, you can move on to the next (or previous) message in the list 
by tapping “ or ‘ in the upper-left corner. (Those controls appear only 
when you’re holding the iPad upright, in portrait orientation.)
Or you can swipe rightward to return to the inbox (or whatever mailbox 
you’re in).
Searching
Praise be—there’s a search box in Mail, above the message list. Tap inside 
the search box to make the keyboard appear. As you type, Mail hides all 
but the matching messages; tap any one of the results to open it.
You don’t have to specify which fields to search (From, To, Subject, Body), 
or which folder. You’re searching everywhere. 
TIP: If you want to restrict the search just to the folder you’re in, you 
can. After the search results begin to appear, tug downward on the 
screen. Two new buttons appear: All Mailboxes and Current Mailbox.
Wait long enough, and the search continues with messages that are still 
out there on the Internet but are so old that they’ve scrolled off your iPad.

Chapter 13
400
Tip: If, after typing a few letters, you tap Search, the keyboard goes away 
and an Edit button appears. Tapping it lets you select a whole bunch 
of the search results—and then delete or file them simultaneously.
Writing Messages
To compose a new piece of outgoing mail, tap √ at top right. A blank new 
outgoing message appears, and the iPad keyboard pops up. 
Here’s how you go about writing a message:
1.	 In the To field, type the recipient’s email address—or grab it from 
Contacts. Often, you won’t have to type much more than the first 
couple of letters of the name or email address. As you type, Mail dis-
plays all matching names and addresses so you can tap one instead 
of typing. (It thoughtfully derives these suggestions by analyzing both 
your Contacts and the people you’ve recently exchanged email with.)
Tip: As you type into the To box, the iPad displays a list of everyone 
whose name matches what you’re typing. The ones bearing * 
buttons are the people you’ve recently corresponded with but who 
are not in your Contacts. Tap the * to open a screen where you 
can add them to Contacts—or remove them from the list of recent 
correspondents, so Mail’s autocomplete suggestions will no longer 
include those lowlifes.
If you hold your finger down on the period (.) key, you get a pop-up 
palette of common email-address suffixes, like .com, .edu, .org, and so 
on.

Email
401
Alternatively, tap the å to open your Contacts list. Tap the name of 
the person you want. 
You can add as many addressees as you like; just repeat the proce-
dure. 
Tip: There’s no Group mail feature on the iPad, which would let you send 
one message to a predefined set of friends. But at http://groups.
yahoo.com, you can create free email groups. You can send a single 
email message to the group’s address, and everyone in the group 
will get a copy. (You have to set up one of these groups in a Web 
browser—but lo and behold, your iPad has one!)
Incidentally, if you’ve set up your iPad to connect to a corporate Ex-
change server (Chapter 16), then you can look up anybody in the en-
tire company directory at this point. Page 460 has the instructions.
2.	 To send a copy to other recipients, enter the address(es) in the Cc 
or Bcc fields. If you tap Cc/Bcc, From, the screen expands to reveal 
two new lines beneath the To line: Cc and Bcc.
Cc stands for carbon copy. Getting an email message where your 
name is in the Cc line implies: “I sent you a copy because I thought 
you’d want to know about this correspondence, but I’m not expecting 
you to reply.”
Bcc stands for blind carbon copy. It’s a copy that goes to a third party 
secretly—the primary addressee never knows who else you sent it to. 
For example, if you send your coworker a message that says, “Chris, it 
bothers me that you’ve been cheating the customers,” you could Bcc 
your supervisor to clue her in without getting into trouble with Chris. 
Each of these lines behaves exactly like the To line. You fill each one 
up with email addresses in the same way. 
Tip: You can drag people’s names around—from the To line to the Cc 
line, for example. Just hold your finger down briefly on the name 
before dragging it. (It puffs and darkens once it’s ready for transit.)
3.	 Change the email account you’re using, if you like. If you have more 
than one email account set up on your iPad, you can tap Cc/Bcc, 
From to expand the form and then tap From to open up a list of your 
accounts. Tap the one you want to use for sending this message.

Chapter 13
402
4.	 Type the topic of the message in the subject line. Leaving it blank 
only annoys your recipient. On the other hand, don’t put the entire 
message into the subject line, either.
5.	 Type your message in the message box. All the usual keyboard and 
dictation tricks apply (Chapters 2 and 4). Don’t forget that you can 
use Copy and Paste, within Mail or from other programs. Both text 
and graphics can appear in your message.
6.	 Attach a photo or a video, if you like. Hold down your finger any-
where in the body of the message until the black buttons appear. Tap 
the Insert Photo or Video button (facing page, top).
When you tap it, you’re shown your iPad’s usual photo browser so 
that you can choose the photos and videos you want to attach (fac-
ing page, middle). Tap the collection you want; you’re shown all the 
thumbnails inside. Tap the photo or video, and then tap Choose. 
You return to your message in progress, with the photo or video 
neatly inserted (facing, bottom). You can repeat this step to add 
additional photo or video attachments. When you tap Send, you’re of-
fered the opportunity to scale down the photo to a more reasonable 
(emailable) size.
Tip: You can also email a photo or a video from within the Photos 
program; you can forward a file attached to an incoming piece of 
mail; and you can paste a copied photo or video (or several) into an 
open email message.

Email
403
7.	 Format the text, if you like. You can apply bold, italic, or underlining 
to mail text you’ve typed.
The trick is to select the text first (page 77). When the button bar 
appears, tap the B I U button. Tap that to make the Bold, Italics, and 
Underline buttons appear on the button bar; tap away. Not terribly 
efficient, but it works.

Chapter 13
404
Tip: You can use the same trick to summon the Quote Level controls. 
Select text; tap the ’ (twice, if you‘re holding the iPad upright) to 
bring the Quote Level button into view; tap it to reveal the Increase 
and Decrease buttons. These buttons indent or un-indent those 
cluttery blocks of quoted and re-quoted text that often appear 
when you’re replying to a message. (One tap affects the entire 
paragraph, not just the selected bit of it.)
If you really can’t stand those quote indentations, you can stop the 
iPad from adding them in the first place when you forward or reply 
to a message. The on/off switch for that feature is in SettingsÆMail, 
Contacts, CalendarsÆIncrease Quote Level.
8.	 Tap Send (to send the message) or Cancel (to back out of it). If you 
tap Cancel, the iPad asks if you want to save the message. If you tap 
Save Draft, then the message lands in your Drafts folder. 
Later you can open the Drafts folder, tap the aborted message, finish 
it up, and send it.
Tip: If you hold down the √ button for a moment, the iPad presents a 
list of your saved drafts. Clever stuff—if you remember it!
Oh, and by the way: You can begin composing a message on your iPad, 
and then continue writing it on your Mac, without ever having to save it as 
a draft. Or go the other way. See page 453 for details on Handoff, new 
in iOS 8.

Email
405
Signatures
A signature is a bit of text that gets stamped at the bottom of your out-
going email messages. It can be your name, a postal address, or a pithy 
quote. 
Unless you intervene, the iPad stamps “Sent from my iPad” at the bottom 
of every message. You may be just fine with that, or you may consider it 
the equivalent of gloating (or free advertising for Apple). In any case, you 
can change the signature if you want to.
Tap SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆ​Sig­nature. You can make up one 
signature for All Accounts, or a different one for each account (tap Per 
Account). A Signature text area appears, complete with a keyboard, so 
you can compose the signature you want.
Tip: You can use bold, italic, or underline formatting in your signature, 
too. Just follow the steps on the previous page for formatting a 
message: Select the text, tap the ’ to bring the B I U button into 
view, and so on.
Surviving Email Overload
If you don’t get much mail, you probably aren’t lying awake at night trying 
to think of ways to manage the information overload on your iPad.
If you do get a lot of mail, here are some tips.
Avoiding Spam
The key to keeping spam (junk mail) out of your inbox is to keep your 
email address out of spammers’ hands in the first place. Use one address 
for actual communication. Use a different address in the public areas of 
the Internet, like chat room posting, online shopping, Web site and soft-
ware registration, and newsgroup posting. Spammers use automated soft-
ware robots that scour these pages, recording email addresses they find. 
Create a separate email account for person-to-person email—and never 
post that address on a Web page.
If it’s too late, and you’re getting a lot of spam on your iPad, you have 
a couple of options. You could accept your fate and set up a new email 
account (like a free Gmail or Yahoo account), sacrificing your old one to 
the spammers.

Chapter 13
406
You could install a spam blocker app on your iPad, like SpamDrain ($15 a 
year) or SpamBlocker (free). 
Or, if you’re technically inclined, you could create a shadow Gmail account 
that downloads your mail, cleans it of spam, and then passes it on to your 
iPad. You can find tutorials for this trick by searching in, of course, Google.
Condensing the Message List
Messages in your inbox are listed with the subject line in bold type and a 
couple of lines, in light-gray text, that preview the message itself.
You can control how many lines of the preview show up here, from None 
(you see more message titles on each screen without scrolling) to 5 Lines. 
Tap SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆPreview.
Spotting Worthwhile Messages
The iPad can display a little j or k logo on each message in your inbox. 
At a glance, it helps you identify which messages are actually intended for 
you. Messages without those logos are probably spam, newsletters, mail-
ing lists, or other messages that weren’t specifically addressed to you.
To turn on these little badges, visit SettingsÆMail, Contacts, Calendars 
and turn on Show To/Cc Label.
Managing Accounts
If you have more than one email account, you can delete one or just tempo-
rarily deactivate one—for example, to accommodate your travel schedule.
Visit SettingsÆMail, Contacts, Calendars. In the list of accounts, tap the 
one you want. At the top of the screen, you see the on/off switch (at least 
for POP accounts); Off makes an account dormant. And at the bottom, 
you see the Delete Account button. 
Tip: If you have several accounts, which one does the iPad use when 
you send mail from other apps—like when you email a photo from 
Photos or a link from Safari?
It uses the default account, of course. You determine which one is 
the default account in SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆDefault 
Account.

J
ust in case you’re one of the six people who’ve never heard of it, 
iTunes is Apple’s multifunction, multimedia jukebox software. It’s 
been loading music onto iPods since the turn of the 21st century. 
Most people use iTunes to manipulate their digital movies, photos, and 
music, from converting songs off a CD into music files to buying songs, 
audiobooks, and movies online. 
But as an iPad owner, you need iTunes even more urgently, because it’s the 
most efficient way to get masses of music, videos, apps, email, addresses, 
appointments, ringtones, and other stuff onto the iPad. It also backs up 
your iPad automatically. 
If you’ve never had a copy of iTunes on your computer, then fire up your 
Web browser and go to www.apple.com/itunes/download. Once the file 
lands on your computer, double-click the installer icon and follow the 
onscreen instructions to add iTunes to your life. 
This chapter gives you a crash course in iTunes and tells you how to sync 
it with your iPad.
Tip: Technically, iTunes is not required. It’s perfectly possible to use 
all of an iPad’s features without even owning a computer. You 
can download all that stuff—music, movies, apps—right from the 
Internet, and you can back up your iPad using iCloud (described in 
the next chapter). 
Using iTunes, however, is more efficient, and it’s nice to know your 
stuff is backed up on a machine that’s within your control.

The Three Faces of iTunes
The first thing to understand is that iTunes is three apps in one. It’s designed 
to be the viewer for all the music, videos, apps, and ebooks in three places: 
(1) on your computer, (2) on your iPad, and (3) in Apple’s online store.
Apple loves to play with the design of this program; every couple of years, 
it gets another overhaul. The following pages describe version 12, for OS X 
and Windows.
In this version, it’s not as clear when you’re looking at the stuff that’s 
already on your computer—or the stuff that’s on the iTunes Store. The 
icons at top left (!,  $,  &, and so on) affect what kind of file you’re view-
ing; the buttons at top center affect whether you’re looking on your com-
puter or online. 
Tip
You can install or remove file-type icons from this top-left “shelf.” 
For starters, you might want to add the Apps icon (.), so that you 
can manage your iPad’s apps in iTunes.
To edit this shelf, click the _ button; from the shortcut menu, 
choose Edit. Click to place checkmarks next to the file types you 
want to appear on the shelf, as shown on the facing page at right.

Syncing with iTunes
409
The playback and volume controls are at the top-left corner of iTunes. At 
the upper-right corner is a search box that lets you pluck one track out of 
a haystack. 
The following pages take you through the three worlds—computer, store, 
iPad—one by one.
Your Stuff
The key to understanding iTunes’ new layout is the “shelf” of file-type 
icons at top left. These represent the kinds of files that iTunes can man-
age: ! (Music), $ (Movies), & (TV Shows), . (Apps), + (Podcasts), , 
(iTunes U), - (Audiobooks), and > (Tones). (Some are probably hiding in 
the _ button.)
To view the music, videos, apps, and ebooks that you’ve downloaded to 
your Mac or PC, click the corresponding “shelf” icon, and then click one of 
the “My” buttons at top center (My TV Shows, My Music, and so on).
The button at top right can sort your files or show them as a list. For 
example, if you clicked !, you can see them displayed as Songs, Albums, 
Artists, Composers, or Genres. And that’s just how they’re displayed; an 
additional control in this menu governs how they’re sorted.
You may see wildly different things here, depending on which display 
you’ve chosen. For example, if you click Songs, you see a huge alphabeti-
cal list; if you click Albums, you see a square grid of album covers.

Three Ways to Fill Your Library 
iTunes gives you at least three ways to get music and video onto your 
computer—ready for transferring to your iPad:
• Let iTunes find your files. The first time you open iTunes, it offers to 
search your PC or Mac for music files and add them to its library.
• Visit the iTunes Store. Another way to feed your iPad is to shop at 
the iTunes Store, as described in the next section.
• Import music from a CD. iTunes can also convert tracks from audio 
CDs into iPad-ready digital music files. Just start up iTunes and then 
stick a CD into your computer’s CD drive. The program asks if you 
want to convert the songs to audio files for iTunes. (If it doesn’t ask, 
click the CD icon at the top of the window.) Click Yes to import all the 
songs or No to view a list of songs and turn off the duds. (Then click 
Import CD near the top of the window.)
The program downloads song titles and artist information from the 
CD and begins to add the songs to the iTunes library. (For more con-
trol over this process, choose iTunesÆPreferencesÆGeneral (Mac) or 
EditÆPreferencesÆGeneral (Windows). Use the When you insert a 
CD pop-up menu.)
In that same Preferences box, you can also click Import Settings to 
choose the format (file type) and bit rate (amount of audio data 
compressed into that format) for your imported tracks. The factory 
setting is the AAC format at 128 kilobits per second. 
Most people think these settings make for fine-sounding music files, 
but you can change your settings to, for example, MP3, another 
format that lets you cram big music into a small space. Upping the 
bit rate from 128 to 256 kbps makes for richer-sounding music files—
which also take up more room.
Once the importing is finished, each imported song bears a green 
checkmark, and you have some brand-new files in your iTunes library.
Playlists
A playlist is a list of songs you’ve decided should go together. For exam-
ple, if you’re having a party, you can make a playlist from the current Top 
40 and dance music in your music library. Some people may question your 
taste if you, say, alternate tracks from La Bohème with Queen’s A Night at 
the Opera, but hey—it’s your playlist. 

Syncing with iTunes
411
To create a playlist in iTunes, press c-N (Mac) or Ctrl+N (Windows). Or 
choose FileÆNewÆPlaylist. Type a name for it: “Cardio Workout,” “Shoe-
Shopping Tunes,” “Hits of the Highland Lute,” or whatever.
Tip: You can also create playlists on the iPad; see page 180.
Now click Add To. The screen is now divided into three sections: All your 
music at left; the selected music in the middle; and your playlist in the 
making at right. Use any of the buttons in the pop-up menu at top right—
Songs, Albums, Artists, whatever—to help you find the songs (or videos); 
then drag their names into your playlist at far right.
Tip: Instead of making an empty playlist and then dragging songs into 
it, you can work the other way. You can scroll through a big list of 
songs, selecting tracks as you go by c-clicking (on the Mac) or 
Ctrl-clicking (in Windows)—and then, when you’re finished, choose 
FileÆNewÆPlaylist From Selection. All the songs you selected 
immediately appear on a brand-new playlist.
When you drag a song title onto a playlist, you’re not actually moving or 
copying the song. In essence, you’re creating an alias or shortcut of the 
original, which means you can have the same song on several different 
playlists. 
iTunes even starts you out with some playlists of its own devising, like 
“Top 25 Most Played” and “Purchased” (a convenient place to find all your 
iTunes Store goodies listed in one place).
Click an artist or album…
Drag the songs you want…
Into the playlist.

Chapter 14
412
Editing and Deleting Playlists
A playlist is easy to change. Click the Music icon (on the top-left “shelf”), 
and then click Playlists:
• Change the order of songs. Drag song titles up or down.
• Add new songs to the playlist. Click Add To (upper right), and then 
tiptoe through your iTunes library and drag more songs into a playlist. 
• Delete songs from the playlist. Click the song in the playlist window 
and then hit Delete or Backspace to get rid of it. When iTunes asks 
you to confirm your decision, click Remove.
Deleting a song from a playlist doesn’t delete it from your music 
library—it just removes the title from your playlist. 
• Delete the whole playlist. To delete an entire playlist, click its name in 
the list of playlists (far left) and then press Delete (Backspace). Again, 
this zaps only the playlist itself; the songs in it are still in iTunes.
iTunes Store
The iTunes software’s second purpose is to be the face of Apple’s online 
iTunes Store. (Click a file type on the “shelf,” like ! or &, and then click 
iTunes Store at top center).
Once you land on the store’s main page and set up your iTunes account, 
you can buy and download songs, audiobooks, ebooks, apps, and videos. 
This material goes straight into your iTunes library, just a sync away from 
the iPad.
Your iPad, of course, can also get to the iTunes Store, wirelessly; just tap 
that purple iTunes Store icon on the Home screen. Any songs you buy on 
the iPad get copied back to iTunes the next time you sync.
Tip: iTunes doesn’t have a monopoly on music sales for your iPad. 
Amazon, Google, Rhapsody, and other services sell songs in MP3 
format, meaning no copy protection. eMusic.com has great MP3 
prices, but the music comes from lesser-known bands. Amazon’s 
MP3 Downloader software for Mac and PC can whip your purchases 
right into iTunes; Rhapsody has similar helper software for Windows.

Syncing with iTunes
413
To navigate the iTunes Store, click the buttons on the file-type “shelf”: ! 
(Music), $ (Movies), & (TV Shows), or whatever.
Music (!)
Here it is, the store that made Apple a powerhouse in the music industry: 
the Music store. Here are millions of songs, individually downloadable, all 
without copy protection, for 79 cents, $1, or $1.29, depending on popularity.
There are all kinds of ways to slice, dice, and search this catalog. On the 
right side of the screen, there’s a Genres pop-up menu that sorts the offer-
ings by music type. Use the search box (top right) to find a song by name, 
album name, band, composer, and so on.
The various buttons on the front page of the Music store represent music 
Apple thinks you might like: new releases, big hits, Genius recommenda-
tions (songs Apple thinks you’ll like based on an analysis of what’s already 
in your library), and so on. 
If you scroll down the right side of the window, you can find lists of the 
top-selling songs and albums. It’s a handy way to see what the rest of your 
fellow music lovers are buying, if you don’t mind being a sheep.
Learning these tools for finding songs is handy, because the same tools 
are available for finding TV shows, movies, podcasts, audiobooks, and so 
on.

Chapter 14
414
TV (&), Movies ($), and Movie Rentals
The iTunes store also offers an increasingly vast selection of downloadable 
TV episodes ($2 apiece, no ads) and movies (some you can buy for $10 to 
$20; others you buy or rent for $3 to $56). 
Once you rent a movie, you have 30 days to start watching—and once you 
start, you have 24 hours to finish before it turns back into a pumpkin (it 
deletes itself from your computer and iPad).
You can do your renting and buying in two ways. First, you can use iTunes 
on your Mac or PC and then sync it to the iPad by following the steps later 
in this chapter.
Second, you can download videos straight to the iPad when you’re in a 
WiFi hotspot. (The difference: If you download a rental movie to your iPad, 
you can’t move it to any other gadget. If you download it to iTunes, you 
can move it from computer to phone to iPad, or whatever, although it can 
exist on only one machine at a time.)
Podcasts (+)
Not everything in the iTunes Store costs money. In addition to free apps, 
there are plenty of free audio and video podcasts, suitable for your iPad, in 
the Podcasts area of the store. See page 333 for more on podcasts—and 
how to download them directly to, and listen directly on, your iPad.
iTunes U (,)
Here, for your personal-growth pleasure, are hundreds of thousands of 
downloadable college courses, all of them free and many of them amaz-
ing. Watch the videos of the professors, follow along with the reading 
materials. You won’t actually earn a college degree this way, but you will 
attain a degree of enlightenment.
Audiobooks (-)
Some people like to curl up with—or listen to—a good book, and iTunes 
has plenty to offer, both as ebooks (which you buy and read in the iBooks 
app) and as audiobooks (which you listen to as you work in the garden or 
drive). 
If iTunes doesn’t offer the audiobook you’re interested in, you can find a 
larger collection (over 50,000 of them) at Audible.com. This Web store 
sells all kinds of audiobooks, plus recorded periodicals like The New York 
Times and radio shows. To purchase Audible’s wares, though, you have to 
go to the Web site and create an Audible account.

If you use Windows, then you can download from Audible.com a little pro-
gram called Audible Download Manager, which catapults your Audible 
downloads into iTunes for you. On the Mac, Audible files land in iTunes 
automatically when you buy them.
Apps (.)
See Chapter 9 for details on grabbing iPad apps, using your computer as 
a loading dock.
Internet Radio (?)
iTunes offers two ways to use the Internet as the world’s biggest AM/ 
FM radio. First, there’s iTunes Radio—the custom radio stations, based on 
songs or singers you like, and delivered to you with full pause/skip capa-
bilities and the occasional ad. It’s exactly the same service that’s described 
on page 173—but in iTunes, you get to it by clicking the iTunes Radio link 
in the list at the right side. 
Before iTunes Radio, the iTunes program offered the option to listen to live 
Internet radio broadcasts—from radio stations and colleges all over the 
world. That feature is still around; click ? on the “shelf,” click the style of 
music or talk you want, and then double-click a station to start listening.
Authorizing Computers
All movies and TV shows, and some old music files, are still copy protected.
When you create an account in iTunes, you automatically authorize 
that computer to play copy-protected songs from the iTunes Store. 
Authorization is Apple’s way of making sure you don’t go playing those 

Chapter 14
416
music tracks on more than five computers, which would greatly displease 
the music studios.
But you can copy those songs and videos onto a maximum of four other 
computers. To authorize each one to play music from your account, choose 
StoreÆAuthorize Computer. (Don’t worry; you have to do this just once 
per machine.) 
When you’ve maxed out your limit and can’t authorize any more com-
puters, you may need to deauthorize one. On the computer you wish to 
demote, choose StoreÆDeauthorize Computer.
Syncing the iPad
The third and final function of iTunes is to load up, and back up, your iPad. 
You can connect it to your computer either wirelessly, over WiFi, or wire-
fully, with the white USB cable that came with it.
Once the iPad is connected, click the π (iPad) button at the top-left corner 
of the iTunes screen. Now you can look over the iPad’s contents or sync it 
(read on).

Syncing with iTunes
417
Note: If you have more than one iPad or iPhone, and they’re all 
connected, this button is a pop-up menu. Choose the name of 
the one you want to manipulate.
Connecting the iPad with a Cable
Pretty simple: Plug one end of the white cable (supplied with your iPad) to 
your computer’s USB jack. Connect the other end to the tablet. If the iPad 
is turned on and awake, it’s officially connected.
Connecting over WiFi
The familiar white USB cable is all well and good—but the iPad is a wire-
less device, for Pete’s sake. Why not sync it to your computer wirelessly? 
The iPad can be charging, happily and automatically syncing with your 
laptop somewhere else in the house. It transfers all the same stuff to and 
from your computer—apps, music, books, contacts, calendars, movies, 
photos, ringtones—but through the air instead of via your USB cable.
Your computer has to be turned on and running iTunes. The iPad and the 
computer have to be on the same WiFi network.
To set up wireless sync, connect the iPad using the white USB cable, one 
last time. Ironic, but true.
Now open iTunes and click ∏ at top left. On the Summary tab, scroll down; 
turn on Sync with this iPad over Wi-Fi. Click Apply. You can now detach 
the iPad. 
From now on, whenever the iPad is on the WiFi network, it’s automati-
cally connected to your computer, wirelessly. You don’t even have to think 
about it. (Well, OK—you have to think about leaving the computer turned 
on with iTunes open, which is something of a buzzkill.)

Chapter 14
418
Just connecting it doesn’t necessarily mean syncing it, though; that’s a 
more data-intensive, battery-drainy process. Syncing happens in either of 
two ways:
• Automatically. If the iPad is plugged into power (like a speaker dock, 
an alarm-clock dock, or a wall outlet), and it’s on the same WiFi net-
work, it syncs with the computer all by itself.
• Manually. You can also trigger a sync manually—and this time, 
the iPad doesn’t have to be plugged into power. To do that, open 
SettingsÆGeneralÆiTunes Wi-Fi Sync and tap Sync Now. (You can 
also trigger a WiFi sync from within iTunes—just click the Sync but-
ton. It says “Sync” only if, in fact, anything has changed since your last 
sync.)
All About Syncing
Transferring data between the iPad and the computer is called synchro-
nization. In general, syncing begins automatically when you connect the 
iPad. The G icon whirls in the top of the screen, but you’re welcome to 
keep using your iPad while it syncs.
Note: Your photo-editing program (like iPhoto or Photoshop Elements) 
probably springs open every time you connect the iPad, too. See 
page 428 if that bugs you.
Now, ordinarily, the iPad-iTunes relationship is automatic and complete, 
according to this scheme:
• Bidirectional copying (iPadDcomputer). Contacts, calendars, and 
Web bookmarks get copied in both directions. That is, after a sync, 
your computer and iPad contain exactly the same information. 
If you entered an appointment on the iPad, it gets copied to your 
computer—and vice versa. If you’ve edited the same contact or ap-
pointment on both machines, then your computer displays the two 
conflicting records and asks you which one “wins.” 
• One-way sync (computerÆiPad). Music, apps, TV, movies, ringtones, 
and ebooks you bought on your computer; photos from your com-
puter; and email account information. All of this gets copied in one 
direction: computerÆtablet.
• One-way sync (iPadÆcomputer). Photos and videos taken with the 
iPad’s camera; music, videos, apps, ringtones, and ebooks you bought 
right from the iPad—it all gets copied the other way, from the iPad to 
the computer.

Syncing with iTunes
419
• A complete backup. iTunes also takes it upon itself to back up every-
thing else on your iPad: settings, text messages, call history, and so 
on. Details on this backup business are covered at the end of this 
chapter.
Tip: If you’re in a hurry, you can skip the time-consuming backup portion 
of the sync. Just click ≈ at the top of the iTunes window whenever 
it says “Backing up.” iTunes gets the message and skips right ahead 
to the next phase of the sync—transferring contacts, calendars, 
music, and so on.
Manual Syncing
OK, but what if you don’t want iTunes to fire up and start syncing every 
time you connect your iPad? What if, for example, you want to change the 
assortment of music and video that’s about to get copied to it? Or what if 
you just want to connect the USB cable to charge the iPad, not to sync it?
In that case, you can stop the autosyncing in any of these ways: 
• Interrupt a sync in progress. Click ˛ in the iTunes status window until 
the syncing stops.
• Stop iTunes from syncing with the iPad just this time. As you plug 
in the iPad’s cable, hold down the Shift+Ctrl keys (Windows) or the 
c-Option keys (Mac) until the iPad pops up in the iTunes window. 
Now you can see what’s on the iPad and change what will be synced 
to it—but no syncing takes place until you command it.
• Stop iTunes from auto-syncing with this iPad. Connect the iPad. Click 
π in the upper-left corner of iTunes. On the Summary tab, turn off 
Automatically sync when this iPad is connected (shown in the previ-
ous illustration).
• Stop iTunes from autosyncing any iPad, ever. In iTunes, choose 
EditÆPreferences (Windows) or iTunesÆPreferences (Mac). Click the 
Devices tab and turn on Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from sync-
ing automatically. You can still trigger a sync on command when the 
iPad is wired up—by clicking the Sync button.
Once you’ve made iTunes stop syncing automatically, you’ve disabled 
what many people consider the greatest feature of the iPad: its magical 
self-updating with the stuff on your computer.

Chapter 14
420
Still, you must have turned off autosyncing for a reason. And that reason 
might be that you want to control what gets copied onto it. Maybe you’re 
in a hurry to leave for the airport, and you don’t have time to sit there for 
an hour while six downloaded movies get copied to the iPad. Maybe you 
have 50 gigabytes of music but only 16 gigs of iPad storage. 
In any case, here are the two ways you can sync manually: 
• Use the tabs in iTunes. With the iPad connected, you can specify 
exactly what you want copied to it—which songs, which TV shows, 
which apps, and so on—using the various tabs in iTunes, as described 
on the following pages. Once you’ve made your selections, click the 
Summary tab and then click Apply. (The Apply button says Sync 
instead if you haven’t actually changed any settings.)
• Drag files onto the iPad icon. Once your iPad is connected to your 
computer, you can click its icon and then turn on Manually manage 
music and videos (on the Summary screen). Click Apply. 
Now you can drag songs and videos directly onto the iPad’s icon to 
copy them there. Wilder yet, you can bypass iTunes entirely by drag-
ging music and video files from your computer’s desktop onto the 
iPad’s icon. That’s handy when you’ve just inherited or downloaded 
a bunch of song files, converted a DVD to the iPad’s video format, or 
whatever. 
Just two notes of warning here. First, unlike a true iPod, the iPad ac-
commodates dragged material from a single computer only. Second, 
if you ever turn off this option, all those manually dragged songs and 
videos will disappear from your iPad at the next sync opportunity.
Tip: Also on the Summary tab, you’ll find the baffling little option called 
Sync only checked songs and videos. This is a global override—a 
last-ditch “Keep the embarrassing songs off my iPad” option. 
When this option is turned on, iTunes consults the tiny checkboxes 
next to every single song and video in your iTunes library. If you turn 
off a song’s checkbox, it will not get synced to your iPad, no matter 
what—even if you use the Music tab to sync All songs or playlists, 
or explicitly turn on a playlist that contains this song. If the song’s or 
video’s checkbox isn’t checked in your Library list, then it will be left 
behind on your computer.
iTunes Tabs
Once your iPad is connected to the computer, and you’ve clicked its icon in 
the upper-left corner of iTunes, the left side of the iTunes window reveals 

Syncing with iTunes
421
a column of word buttons: Summary, Apps, Music, Movies, TV Shows, 
Podcasts, Books, Photos, and Info. Below that is a second, duplicate list-
ing, labeled On My Device. For the most part, these represent the catego-
ries of stuff you can sync to your iPad. 
The following pages cover each of these tabs, in sequence, and detail how 
to sync each kind of iPad-friendly material.
TIP: At the bottom of the screen, a colorful graph shows you the number 
and types of files: Audio, Video, Photos, Apps, Books, Documents 
& Data, and Other (for your personal data). More importantly, it 
also shows you how much room you have left, so you won’t get 
overzealous in trying to load the thing up.
Point to each color block without clicking to see how many of each 
item there are (“2031 photos”) and how much space they take.
Summary Tab
This screen gives basic stats on your iPad, like its serial number and 
capacity. 
Buttons in the middle control how and where the iPad gets backed up. 
Checkboxes at the bottom of the screen let you set up manual syncing, as 
described previously.
Tip: If you click your iPad’s serial number, it changes to reveal the 
unique device identifier (UDID). That’s Apple’s behind-the-scenes 
ID for your exact product, used primarily by software companies 
(developers). You may, during times of beta testing a new app or 
troubleshooting an existing one, be asked to supply your iPad’s 
UDID.
You can click the same label again to see your iPad’s Product Type 
and your various cellular identifiers like the MEID, IMEI, and ICCID. 
If it’s a cellular model, you can cycle through enough clicks until 
you see the iPad’s phone number. (Yes, it has its own phone 
number—for data, not for phone calls.) Or click the iOS version to 
see your iOS version’s build number. 
You can right-click (or, on the Mac, Control-click) any of these 
numbers to get the Copy command. It copies those long strings of 
letters and numbers onto your computer’s Clipboard, ready to paste 
into an email or a text.

Chapter 14
422
Apps Tab
On this tab, you get a convenient duplicate of your iPad’s Home screens. 
You can drag app icons around, create folders, and otherwise organize 
your Home screens much faster than you’d be able to on the iPad itself. 
See page 271 for details.
Music Tab
Turn on Sync Music. Now decide what music to put on your iPad:
• If you have a big iPad and a small music library, you can opt to sync 
the Entire music library.
• If you have a big music collection and a small iPad, you’ll have to take 
only some of it along for the iPad ride. In that case, click Selected 
play­lists, artists, albums, and genres. In the lists below, turn on the 
checkboxes for the playlists, artists, albums, and music genres you 
want to transfer. (These are cumulative. If there’s no Electric Light 
Orchestra in any of your selected playlists, but you turn on ELO in the 
Artists list, you’ll get all your ELO anyway.)
Tip: Playlists make it fast and easy to sync whole batches of tunes over 
to your iPad. But don’t forget that you can add individual songs, 
too, even if they’re not in any playlist. Just turn on Manually manage 
music and videos. Now you can drag individual songs and videos 
from your iTunes library onto the iPad icon to install them there.

Syncing with iTunes
423
If you’ve got music videos or voice memos (recorded by the iPad and now 
residing on your computer), you’ll see that they get their own checkboxes.
Making It All Fit
Sooner or later, everybody has to confront the fact that an iPad holds only 
16, 32, 64, or 128 gigabytes of music and video. (Actually less, because the 
operating system itself eats up over a gigabyte.) That’s enough for around 
4,000, 8,000, 16,000, or 32,000 average-length songs—if you don’t put 
any videos or photos on there.
Your multimedia stash may be bigger than that. If you just turn on Sync 
All checkboxes, an error message tells you that it won’t all fit on the iPad.
One solution: Tiptoe through the tabs, turning off checkboxes and trying 
to sync until the “too much” error message goes away.
If you don’t have quite so much time, turn on Automatically fill free space 
with songs. It makes iTunes use artificial Genius intelligence to load up 
your iPad automatically, using your most played and most recent music as 
a guide. (It does not, in fact, fill the iPad completely; it leaves a few hun-
dred megabytes for safety—so you can download more stuff on the road, 
for example.)
Another helpful approach is to use the smart playlist, a music playlist that 
assembles itself based on criteria you supply. For example:
1.	 In iTunes, click !. Choose FileÆNew Smart Playlist. The Smart 
Playlist dialog box appears.
2.	 Specify the category. Use the pop-up menus to choose, for example, 
a musical genre, or songs you’ve played recently, or haven’t played 
recently, or have rated highly.

Chapter 14
424
3.	 Turn on the “Limit to” checkbox, and set up the constraints. For 
example, you could limit the amount of music in this playlist to 2 giga-
bytes, chosen at random. That way, every time you sync, you’ll get a 
fresh, random supply of songs on your iPad, with enough room left 
for some videos.
4.	 Click OK. The new Smart Playlist appears in the list of playlists at left; 
you can rename it.
Click it to look it over, if you like. Then, on the Music tab, choose this playl-
ist for syncing to the iPad.
Movies and TV Shows Tabs
One of the things the iPad does best is play video on its gorgeous, glossy 
screen. TV shows and movies you’ve bought or rented from the iTunes 
Store look especially nice. (And if you start watching a rented movie on 
your computer, the iPad begins playing it right from where you left off.)
Syncing TV shows and movies works just like syncing music or podcasts. 
You can have iTunes copy all your stuff to the iPad, but video fills up your 
storage fast. That’s why you can turn on the checkboxes of just the indi-
vidual movies or shows (either seasons or episodes) you want—or, using 
the Automatically include pop-up menu, request only the most recent, or 
the most recent ones you haven’t seen yet.
Remember that if you’ve rented a movie from the iTunes Store and started 
watching it, you have only 24 hours left to finish before it vanishes from 
your iPad.

Syncing with iTunes
425
Podcasts Tab
iTunes gives you access, in the iTunes Store, to thousands of free amateur 
and professional podcasts (basically, downloadable radio or TV shows).
Here you can choose to sync all podcast episodes, selected shows, all 
unplayed episodes—or just a certain number of episodes per sync. 
Individual checkboxes let you choose which podcast series get to come 
along for the ride, so you can sync to suit your mood at the time.
Books Tab
Here are the thumbnails of your audiobooks and your ebooks—those 
you’ve bought from Apple, those you’ve downloaded from the Web, and 
those you’ve dragged right into iTunes from your desktop (PDF files, for 
example). You can ask iTunes to send them all to your iPad—or only the 
ones whose checkboxes you turn on.
Tones Tab
Any ringtones that you’ve bought from the iTunes Store or made yourself 
appear here; you can specify which ones you want synced to the iPad. 
(This tab was once called “Ringtones,” but the iPad can handle tones for 
all kinds of different events, like incoming text messages or mail, tweets, 
reminders, and so on.) You can choose either All tones or, if space on your 
iPad is an issue, Selected tones (and then turn on the ones you want).

Chapter 14
426
Be sure to sync over any ringtones you’ve assigned to your frequent call-
ers so the iPad can alert you with a personalized audio cue, like Pink’s ren-
dition of “Tell Me Something Good” when they call you up.
Photos Tab (ComputerÆiPad)
Why corner people with your wallet to show them your kid’s baby pic-
tures, when you can whip out your iPad and dazzle them with a slideshow? 
iTunes can sync the photos from your hard drive onto the iPad. You can 
even select individual albums of images that you’ve already assembled on 
your computer. 
Here are your iPad-filling options for photos:
• Windows: You can sync with Photoshop Elements, Photoshop Album, 
or any folder of photos, like My Pictures (in Windows), Pictures (on 
the Mac), or any folder you like.
• Mac: You can sync with iPhoto, Aperture, or OS X Yosemite’s new 
Photos app.
Note: You can sync photos from only one computer. If you later attempt 
to snag some snaps from a second machine, iTunes warns you 
that you must first erase all the images that came from the 
original computer. 

Syncing with iTunes
427
When you’re ready to sync your photos, click the Photos tab in iTunes. 
Turn on Sync photos from, and then indicate where you’d like to sync them 
from (Photoshop Elements, iPhoto, or whatever).
If you’ve chosen a photo-shoebox program’s name (and not a folder’s 
name), you can then click Selected albums, events, and faces. Turn on 
the checkboxes of the albums, events, and faces you want synced. (The 
“faces” option is available only if you’re syncing from iPhoto, Aperture, 
or Photos on the Mac, and only if you’ve used the Faces feature, which 
groups your photos according to who’s in them.) This option also offers 
to tack on recent Events (batches of photos taken the same day). Indicate 
whether or not you want videos included in the syncing (Include videos).
Once you make your selections and click Apply, the program computes 
for a time, “optimizing” copies of your photos to make them look great 
on the iPad (for example, downsizing them from 10-megapixel overkill to 
something more appropriate for the iPad’s screen), and then ports them 
over.
After the sync is complete, you’ll be able to wave your iPad around, and 
people will beg to see your photos.
Syncing Photos and Videos (iPadÆComputer)
The previous section described copying photos in only one direction: 
from the computer to the iPad. But you can go the opposite direction, 
too: You can send photos and videos you took with the iPad’s own cam-
era to the computer. You can rest easy, knowing that they’re backed up to 
your computer for safekeeping.
Now, it’s important to understand that iTunes is not involved in this pro-
cess. It doesn’t know anything about photos or videos coming from the 
iPad; its job is just to copy pictures to the iPad.
So what’s handling the iPad-to-computer transfer? Your operating system. 
It sees the iPad as though it’s a digital camera and suggests importing 
them just as it would from a camera’s memory card.
Here’s how it goes: Plug the iPad into the computer with the USB cable. 
What you’ll see is probably something like this:
• On the Mac. iPhoto opens. This free photo-organizing/editing soft-
ware comes on every Mac. Shortly after it notices that the iPad is on 
the premises, it goes into Import mode. Click Import All, or select 
some thumbnails from the iPad and then click Import Selected.

Chapter 14
428
After the transfer, click Delete Photos if you’d like the iPad’s pho-
tographic memory cleared out after the transfer. (Both photos and 
videos get imported together.)
Note: In 2015, Apple expects to replace the iPhoto program with new 
software called Photos. You can expect it to work similarly. 
• In Windows. When you attach a camera (or an iPad), a dialog 
box asks how you want its contents handled. It lists any photo-
management program you might have installed (Picasa, Photoshop 
Elements, Photoshop Album, and so on), as well as Windows’ 
own camera-management software. (That would be the Scanner 
and Camera Wizard in Windows XP; Using Windows in Vista or 
Windows 7 or 8).
Click the program you want to handle importing the iPad pictures and 
videos. 
You’ll probably also want to turn on Always do this for this device, so 
it’ll happen automatically the next time.
Shutting Down the Importing Process
Then again, some iPad owners would rather not see some lumbering 
photo-management program firing itself up every time they connect the 
iPad. You, too, might wish there were a way to stop iPhoto or Windows 
from bugging you every time you connect the iPad. That is easy enough 
to change—if you know where to look.
• Windows Vista, Windows 7 and 8. When the AutoPlay dialog box 
appears, click Set AutoPlay defaults in Control Panel. (Or, if the 
AutoPlay dialog box is no longer on the screen, choose StartÆControl 
PanelÆAutoPlay.)
Scroll all the way to the bottom until you see the iPad icon. From the 
pop-up menu, choose Take no action. Click Save.
• Macintosh. Open iPhoto. Choose iPhotoÆPreferences. Where it says 
Connecting camera opens, choose No application. Close the window. 
From now on, no photo-importing message will appear when you plug in 
the iPad. (You can always import its photos manually, of course.)

Syncing with iTunes
429
Info Tab
On this tab, you’re offered the chance to copy some distinctly non-
entertainment data over to your iPad: your computer’s calendar, address 
book, email settings, and Web bookmarks.
Now, none of this setup is necessary if you use iCloud (Chapter 15), and 
you’ve told your iPad to sync its calendar (in SettingsÆiCloud). That’s 
because iCloud, not iTunes, handles synchronization with the iPad. Instead, 
this tab shows only a message that, for example, “Your calendars are being 
synced with your iPad over the air from iCloud.”
Syncing Contacts and Calendars
If you’re not using iCloud syncing, then you can choose to sync your iPad’s 
address book with a Windows program like Outlook, Outlook Express, or 
Windows Live Mail; a Mac program like Contacts or Entourage/Outlook 
for Mac; or an online address book like Google Contacts or Yahoo Address 
Book.
Similarly, you can sync the iPad’s calendar with a program like Outlook (for 
Windows) or Calendar or Outlook (on the Mac). 
On My Device
Below those Settings tabs at the left side of the iTunes window, there’s a 
second, similar set labeled On My Device. It’s a tidy list of everything that 
is, in fact, on your iPad, organized by type (Music, Movies, and so on). 
There’s not really much you can do here—you can get more information 
about some items by pointing to them—but just seeing your multimedia 
empire arrayed before you can be very satisfying.
The Purchased category, in particular, can be handy; it shows everything 
on your iPad that you’ve bought with the iPad.
One iPad, Multiple Computers
In general, Apple likes to keep things simple. Everything it ever says about 
the iPad suggests that you can only sync one iPad with one computer.
That’s not really true, however. You can actually sync the same iPad with 
multiple Macs or PCs. 

Chapter 14
430
And why would you want to do that? So you can fill it up with material 
from different places: music and video from a Mac at home; contacts, cal-
endar, ebooks, and iPad applications from your Windows PC at work; and 
maybe even the photos from your laptop. 
iTunes derives these goodies from different sources to begin with—pic-
tures from your photo program, addresses and appointments from your 
contacts and calendar programs, music and video from iTunes. So all you 
have to do is set up the tabs of each computer’s copy of iTunes to sync 
only certain kinds of material.
On the Mac, for example, you’d turn on the Sync checkboxes for only the 
Music, Podcasts, and Video tabs. Sync away.
Next, take the iPad to the office; on your PC, turn on the Sync checkboxes 
on only the Info, Books, and Apps tabs. Sync away once more. Then, on 
the laptop, turn off Sync on all tabs except Photos. 
And off you go. Each time you connect the iPad to one of your computers, 
it syncs that data according to the preferences set in that copy of iTunes.
One Computer, Multiple iPads
It’s fine to sync multiple iPads with a single computer, too. iTunes cheer-
fully fills each one up, and can back each one up, as they come. In fact, if 
you open the Preferences box (in the iTunes menu on the Mac, the Edit 
menu on Windows), the Devices tab lists all the iPads that iTunes is track-
ing (and iPhones and iPod Touches).
Backing Up the iPad
You’ve spent all this time tweaking preferences, massaging settings, and 
getting everything just so on your expensive iPad. Wouldn’t it be great if 
you could back up all that work so that if something bad happens to the 
iPad, you wouldn’t have to start from scratch?
Fortunately, you can. Your iPad can back up everything your computer 
doesn’t already have a copy of: stuff you’ve downloaded to the iPad 
(music, ebooks, apps, and so on), plus less-visible things, like your iPad’s 
mail and network settings, your call history, contact favorites, notes, text 
messages, and other personal preferences that are hard or impossible to 
recreate. 

Syncing with iTunes
431
Tip: If you turn on the Encrypted iPad Backup option, then your backup 
will include all your passwords: for WiFi hotspots, Web sites, email 
accounts, and so on. That can save you tons of time when you have 
to restore the iPad from the backup. (The one downside: You’ll be 
asked to make up a password for the backup. Don’t forget it!)
You can create your backups in either of two places:
• On your computer. You get a backup every time the iPad syncs with 
iTunes. The backup also happens before you install a new iPad firm-
ware version from Apple. iTunes also offers to do a backup before you 
use the Restore option described below. 
• On iCloud. You can also back up your iPad wirelessly and automati-
cally—to iCloud, if you’ve signed up. That method has the advantage 
of being available even if your computer gets lost or burned to a 
crisp in a house fire. On the other hand, since your free iCloud stor-
age holds only 5 gigabytes, and your iPad holds 16 or more, the free 
iCloud account usually isn’t enough. See the next chapter for details.
You make this choice on the Summary tab described above. (You also 
have the option of encrypting the backup, so that no NSA snoop can steal 
your laptop and root around in your backup files.)
Using That Backup
So the day has come when you really need to use that backup of your 
iPad. Maybe it’s become unstable, and it’s crashing all over. Or maybe you 
just lost the dang thing, and you wish your replacement iPad could have 
all your old info and settings on it. Here’s how to save the day (and your 
data):
1.	 Connect the iPad to the computer you normally use to sync with.
2.	 Click the π (iPad) button; click the Summary tab.
3.	 Take a deep breath and click Restore iPad. A message may announce 
that you can’t erase the iPad without first turning off Find My iPad. 
This is a security measure to stop a thief from erasing a stolen iPad. 
He can’t restore the iPad without turning off Find My iPad, and he 
can’t turn off Find My iPad without your iCloud password. Go to the 
iPad and do that (in SettingsÆiCloud). 
4.	 Take iTunes up on its offer to restore all your settings and stuff from 
the backup. If you see multiple backup files listed from other iPads, be 
sure to pick the backup file for your iPad. Let the backup restore your 
iPad settings and info. Then resync all your music, videos, and pod-
casts. Exhale.

Tip: For the truly paranoid, there’s nothing like a backup of your 
backup. Yes, you can actually back up the iTunes backup file, 
maybe on a flash drive, for safekeeping. On a Mac, look in 
HomeÆLibraryÆApplication SupportÆMobileSyncÆBackup. For 
Windows Vista, 7, or 8, visit C: driveÆUserÆ​App Data (hidden 
folder)Æ​RoamingÆApple ComputerÆMobileSyncÆ​Backup.
If you get in a situation where you need to restore your iPad through 
iTunes on a different computer (say if your old machine croaked), 
install iTunes on it and then slip this backup file into the same folder 
on the new computer. Then follow the steps on these pages to 
restore your data to the iPad.
Deleting a Backup File
To save disk space, you can delete old backups (especially for i-gadgets 
you no longer own). Go to the iTunes preferences (EditÆPreferences in 
Windows or iTunesÆPreferences on the Mac) and click the Devices tab. 
Click the dated backup file you don’t want and hit Delete Backup, as 
shown here.

iCloud & Continuity
433

A
pple’s free iCloud service stems from Apple’s brainstorm that, 
since it controls both ends of the connection between a Mac 
and the Apple Web site, it should be able to create some pretty 
clever Internet-based features.
This chapter concerns what iCloud can do for you, the iPad owner.
Note: To get a free iCloud account if you don’t already have one, sign 
up in SettingsÆiCloud.
What iCloud Giveth
So what is iCloud? Mainly, it’s these things:
• A synchronizing service. It keeps your calendar, address book, and 
documents updated and identical on all your gadgets: Mac, PC, iPad, 
iPhone, iPod Touch. Also your Web passwords and credit card num-
bers. That’s a huge convenience—almost magical.
• Find My iPhone pinpoints the current location of your iPad on a map 
(and iPhones, and Macs). In other words, it’s great for helping you find 
your iPad if it’s been stolen or lost.
You can also make your lost gadget start making a loud pinging 
sound for a couple of minutes by remote control. That’s brilliantly ef-
fective when your iPad has slipped under the couch cushions. 
• An email account. Handy, really: An iCloud account gives you a new 
email address. If you already have an email address, great! This new 
one can be a backup account, one you never enter on Web sites so 
that it never gets overrun with spam. Or vice versa: Let this be your 
junk account, the address you use for online forms. Either way, it’s 
great to have a second account.
iCloud & 
Continuity

Chapter 15
434
• An online locker. Anything you buy from Apple—music, TV shows, 
ebooks, and apps—is stored online, for easy access at any time. For 
example, whenever you buy a song or a TV show from the online 
iTunes Store, it appears automatically on your iPad and computers. 
Your photos are stored online, too.
• Back to My Mac. This option lets you access the contents of one Mac 
from another one across the Internet.
• Automatic backup. iCloud can back up your iPad—automatically and 
wirelessly (over WiFi). It’s a quick backup, since iCloud backs up only 
the changed data.
If you ever want to set up a new i-gadget, or if you want to restore 
everything to an existing one, life is sweet. Once you’re in a WiFi 
hotspot, all you have to do is re-enter your Apple ID and password in 
the setup assistant that appears when you turn the thing on. Magi-
cally, your gadget is refilled with everything that used to be on it.
Well, almost everything. An iCloud backup stores everything you’ve 
bought from Apple (music, apps, books); photos and videos in your 
Camera Roll; settings, including the layout of your Home screen; text 
messages; and ringtones. Your mail, and anything that came from 
your computer (like music/ringtones/videos from iTunes and photos 
from iPhoto), have to be reloaded.
• Family Sharing is a broad category of features intended for families 
(up to six people). 
First, everyone can share stuff bought from Apple’s online stores: 
movies, TV shows, music, ebooks, and so on. It’s all on a single credit 
card, but you, the all-knowing parent, can approve each person’s 
purchases—without having to share your account password. That’s a 
great solution to a long-standing problem.
There’s also a shared family photo album and an auto-shared Family 
category on the calendar. Any family member can see the location of 
any other family member, and they can find each other’s lost iPads or 
iPhones using Find My iPhone. 
• iCloud Drive is Apple’s version of Dropbox. It’s a folder, present on 
every Mac, iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch, that lists whatever you’ve 
put into it—an online “disk” that holds 5 gigabytes (more, if you’re will-
ing to pay money). 
The iCloud Drive is a perfect place to put stuff you want to be able to 
access from any Apple gadget, wherever you go. It’s a great backup, 
too.

iCloud & Continuity
435
• Continuity. If you have an iPhone, you’re in for a treat. The set of 
features Apple calls Continuity turn the iPhone into a part of the iPad. 
They let you make calls from your iPad as though it were a speaker-
phone. They let you send and receive text messages from your iPad—
to any cellphone on earth. They let you AirDrop files between a Mac, 
iPhone, and iPad, wirelessly. And more.
So there’s the quick overview. The rest of the chapter covers each of these 
iCloud features in greater depth.
iCloud Sync
For many people, this may be the killer app for iCloud right here: The iCloud 
Web site, acting as the master control center, can keep multiple Macs, 
Windows PCs, and iPads/iPhones/iPod Touches synchronized. That offers 
both a huge convenience factor—all your stuff is always on all your gad-
gets—and a safety/backup factor, since you have duplicates everywhere.
It works by storing the master copies of your stuff—email, notes, con-
tacts, calendars, Web bookmarks, and documents—on the Web. (Or “in 
the cloud,” as the product managers would say.) 
Whenever your Macs, PCs, or i-gadgets are online—over WiFi or cel-
lular—they connect to the mother ship and update themselves. Edit an 
address on your iPad, and shortly thereafter you’ll find the same change 
in Contacts (on your Mac) and Outlook (on your PC). Send an email reply 
from your PC at the office, and you’ll find it in your Sent Mail folder on the 
Mac at home. Add a Web bookmark anywhere and find it everywhere else. 
Edit a spreadsheet in Numbers on your iPad and find the same numbers 
updated on your Mac.
Actually, there’s even another place where you can work with your data: 
on the Web. Using your computer, you can log into www.icloud.com to find 
Web-based clones of Calendar, Contacts, and Mail. 
To control the syncing, tap SettingsÆiCloud on your iPad. Turn on the 
checkboxes of the stuff you want to be synchronized all the way around:
• iCloud Drive. This is the on/off switch for the iCloud Drive (page 
283). Look Me Up by Email is a list of apps that permit other iCloud 
members to find you by looking up your address. And Use Cellular 
Data lets you prevent a cellular iPad from doing its iCloud Drive syn-
chronization over the cellular network, since you probably get only a 
limited data allotment each month.
• Photos. Tap the > button to see four on/off switches. 

Chapter 15
436
iCloud Photo Library is Apple’s new online photo storage feature. It 
stores all your photos and videos online, so you can access them from 
any Apple gadget; you can read more about it on page 255.
My Photo Stream and iCloud Photo Sharing are the master switches 
for Photo Streams, which are among iCloud’s marquee features 
(Chapter 15).
When you hold your finger down on the shutter button, recent iPad 
models can snap 10 frames a second. That’s burst mode—and all 
those photos can fill up your iCloud storage. So Apple gives you the 
Upload Burst Photos option to exclude them from the backup.
• Mail. “Mail” refers to your actual email messages, plus your account 
settings and preferences from OS X’s Mail program. 
• Contacts, Calendars. There’s nothing as exasperating as realizing that 
the address book you’re consulting on your iPad is missing some-
body you’re sure you entered—on your iPhone. This option keeps 
all your address books and calendars synchronized. Delete a phone 
number on your computer at home, and you’ll find it gone from your 
iPad. Enter an appointment on your iPad, and you’ll find the calendar 
updated everywhere else.

iCloud & Continuity
437
• Reminders. This option refers to the to-do items you create in the 
iPad’s Reminders app; very shortly, those reminders will show up on 
your Mac (in Reminders, Calendar, or BusyCal) or PC (in Outlook). 
How great to make a reminder for yourself in one place and have it 
reminding you later in another one!
• Safari. If a Web site is important enough to merit bookmarking 
while you’re using your iPad, why shouldn’t it also show up in the 
Bookmarks menu on your desktop PC at home, your Mac laptop, or 
your iPhone? This option syncs your Safari Reading List, too.
• Notes. This option syncs the notes from your iPad’s Notes app into 
the Notes app on the Mac, the email program on your PC, your other 
i-gadgets, and, of course, the iCloud Web site.
• Passbook. If you’ve bought tickets for a movie, show, game, or plane 
flight, you sure as heck don’t want to be stuck without them because 
you left the barcode on your other gadget.
• Backup. Your iPad can back itself up online, automatically, so that 
you’ll never worry about losing your files along with your tablet.
Of course, most of the important stuff is already backed up by iCloud, 
in the process of syncing it (calendar, contacts—all the stuff described 
on these pages). So this option just backs up everything else: all your 
settings, your Health data, your documents, your account settings, 
and your photo library.
There are some footnotes. The wireless backing-up happens only 
when your iPad is charging and in a WiFi hotspot. And remember that 
a free iCloud account includes only 5 gigabytes of storage; your iPad 
probably requires a lot more space than that. Using iCloud Backup 
may mean paying for more iCloud storage. Apple’s prices are $12 a 
year for 20 gigabytes, $48 a year for 200 gigs, and so on.)
• Keychain. The login information for your Web sites (names and pass-
words), and even your credit card information, can be stored right on 
your iPad—and synced to your other iPads, iPhones, and Macs (run-
ning OS X Mavericks or later).
Now, you could argue that Web-site passwords and credit card num-
bers are more important than, say, your Reminders. For this category, 
you don’t want to mess around with security.
Therefore, when you turn on the Keychain switch in Settings, you’re 
asked to enter your iCloud password. 

Chapter 15
438
Then you get a choice of ways to confirm your realness—either by 
entering a code that Apple texts to you or by using another Apple 
device to set up this one. Once that’s done, your passwords and 
credit cards are magically synced across your computers and mobile 
gadgets, saving you unending headaches. This is a truly great feature 
that’s worth enduring the setup.
• Find My iPad. This is the on/off switch for the lifesaving tablet-
location feature described on page 438. If you don’t turn this fea-
ture on here, you won’t be able to use it there.
To set up syncing, turn on the switches for the items you want synced. 
That’s it. There is no step 2.
Note: You may notice that there are no switches here for syncing stuff 
you buy from Apple, like books, movies, apps, and music. They’re 
not so much synced as they are stored for you online. You can 
download them at any time to any of your machines.
Photo Stream, Photo Sharing
These iCloud features are described in glorious detail in Chapter 8—the 
photos chapter.
Find My iPad
Did you leave your iPad somewhere? Did it get stolen? Has that mischie-
vous 5-year-old left it somewhere in the house again? 
Sounds like you’re ready to avail yourself of one of Apple’s finest creations: 
Find My iPad. 
The first step is to log into iCloud.com and click Find My iPhone. Imme­
diately, the Web site updates to show you, on a map, the current location 
of your iPad—and Macs, iPod Touches, and iPhones. (If they’re not online, 
or if they’re turned all the way off, you won’t see their current locations.)
If you own more than one, you may have to click All Devices and, from the 
list, choose the one you’re looking for.
If just knowing where the thing is isn’t enough to satisfy you, then click the 
dot representing your iPad, click the * next to its name, and marvel at the 
appearance of these three buttons:

iCloud & Continuity
439
• Play Sound. When you click this button, the iPad starts dinging and 
vibrating loudly for 2 minutes, wherever it is, so you can figure out 
which backpack you left it in. It beeps even if the ringer switch is off, 
and even if the iPad is asleep. Once you find the iPad, just wake it in 
the usual way to make the dinging stop.
• Lost Mode. When you lose your iPad for real, proceed immediately 
to Lost Mode. Its first step: Prompting you to password protect it, if 
you haven’t already. Without the password, the sleazy crook can’t get 
into your iPad without erasing it. (If your iPad is already password-
protected, you don’t see this step.)
The passcode you dream up here works just as though you’d created 
one yourself on the iPad. That is, it remains in place until you, with 
the iPad in hand, manually turn it off in SettingsÆGeneralÆ​Passcode 
Lock.
Next, the Web site asks for a phone number where you can be 
reached, and (when you click Next) for a message you want displayed 
on the iPad’s Lock screen. If you left the thing in a taxi or on some 
restaurant table, you can use this feature to plead for its return. 
When you click Done, your message appears on the iPad’s screen, 
wherever it is, no matter what app was running, and the iPad locks 
itself. 
Whoever finds it can’t miss the message, and can’t do anything with-
out dismissing the message first. 

Chapter 15
440
If the finder of your iPad really isn’t such a nice person, at least you’ll 
get an automatic email every time the iPad moves from place to 
place, so you can track the thief’s whereabouts. (Apple sends these 
messages to your @me.com or @icloud.com address.)
• Erase iPad. This is the last-ditch security option, for when your imme-
diate concern isn’t so much the iPad as all the private stuff that’s on it. 
Click this button, confirm the dire warning box, enter your iCloud ID, 
and click Erase. By remote control, you’ve just erased everything from 
your iPad, wherever it may be. (If it’s ever returned, you can restore it 
from your backup.)
Once you’ve wiped the iPad, you can no longer find it or send mes-
sages to it using Find My iPad.
Tip: There’s an app for that. Download the Find My iPad app from the 
App Store. It lets you do everything described above from another 
iPad, in a tidy, simple control panel.
Send Last Location
Find My iPad works great—as long as your lost iPad has power, is turned 
on, and is online. Often, though, it’s lying dead somewhere, or it’s been 
turned off, or there’s no Internet service. In those situations, Find My iPad 
can’t help you.

iCloud & Continuity
441
Or can it? 
Thanks to Send Last Location—a clever iOS 8 enhancement that you turn 
on in SettingsÆiCloudÆ​Find My iPad—you have a prayer of finding your 
iPad again. Before it dies, your iPad will send Apple its location. You have 
24 hours to log into iCloud.com and use the Find My iPad feature to see 
where it was at the time of death. (After that, Apple deletes the location 
information.) That’s a lot better than the old system, by which Find My 
iPad drew a blank if the iPad was dead or off.
You definitely want to turn this switch on.
Activation Lock
Thousands of people have found their lost or stolen iPads by using Find 
My iPad. Yay!
Unfortunately, thousands more will never see their tablets again. Until 
recently, Find My iPad had a back door the size of Montana: The thief 
could simply turn it off. Or, if your iPad was password-protected, the thief 
could just erase it and sell it on the black market, which was his goal all 
along. Suddenly, your iPad is lost in the wilderness, and you have no way 
to track or recover it.
That’s why Apple offers the ingenious Activation Lock feature. It’s very 
simple: Nobody can erase it, or even turn off Find My iPad, without enter-
ing your iCloud password (your Apple ID). This isn’t a switch you can turn 
on or off; it’s always on.
So even if the bad guy has your iPad and tries to sell it, the thing is useless. 
It’s still registered to you, you can still track it, and it still displays your mes-
sage and phone number on the Lock screen. Without your iCloud pass-
word, your iPad is just a worthless brick. Suddenly, stealing iPads is a much 
less attractive prospect.
Email
Apple offers an email address as part of each iCloud account. Of course, 
you already have an email account. So why bother? The first advantage is 
the simple address: YourName@me.com or YourName@icloud.com.
Second, you can read your me.com email from any computer anywhere 
in the world, via the iCloud Web site, or on your iPad/iPod Touch/iPhone.
To make things even sweeter, your me.com or icloud.com mail is com-
pletely synced. Delete a message on one gadget, and you’ll find it in the 
Deleted Mail folder on another. Send a message from your iPad, and you’ll 
find it in the Sent Mail folder on your Mac. And so on.

Video, Music, Apps: Locker in the Sky
Apple, as if you hadn’t noticed, has become a big seller of multimedia files. 
It has the biggest music store in the world. It has the biggest app store, for 
both i-gadgets and Macs. It sells an awful lot of TV shows and movies. Its 
ebook store, iBooks, is no Amazon.com, but it’s chugging along.
Once you buy a song, movie, app, or book, you can download it again as 
often as you like—no charge. In fact, you can download it to your other 
Apple equipment, too—no charge. iCloud automates, or at least formal-
izes, that process. Once you buy something, it’s added to a tidy list of 
items that you can download to all your other machines.
Here’s how to grab them:
• iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch. For apps: Open the App Store icon. Tap 
Purchased. Tap Not on This iPad. 
For music, movies, and TV shows: Open the iTunes Store app. Tap 
Purchased; tap the category you want. Tap Not on This iPad.
There they are: all the items you’ve ever bought, even on your other 
machines using the same Apple ID. To download anything listed here 

iCloud & Continuity
443
onto this machine, tap the U button. Or tap an album name to see 
the list of songs on it so you can download just some of those songs.
You can save yourself all that tapping by opening SettingsÆiTunes 
& App Store and turning on Automatic Downloads (for music, apps, 
and books). From now on, whenever you’re on WiFi, stuff you’ve 
bought on other Apple machines gets downloaded to this one auto-
matically, in the background.
• Mac or PC. Open the Mac App Store program (for Mac apps) and 
click Purchases. Or open the iTunes app (for songs, TV shows, books, 
and movies). Click Store and then, under Quick Links, click Purchased. 
There are all your purchases, ready to open or re-download if 
necessary.
Tip: To make this automatic, open iTunes. Choose iTunesÆ​PreferencesÆ​
Store. Under Automatic Downloads, turn on Music, Apps, and 
Books, as you see fit. Click OK. From now on, iTunes will auto-
import anything you buy on any of your other machines.
Any bookmark you set in an iBook book is synced to your other gadgets, 
too. The idea, of course, is that you can read a few pages on your iPad in 
the doctor’s waiting room and then continue from the same page on your 
iPad on the train ride home.
iTunes Match
Anything you’ve ever bought from the iTunes music store is now available 
for playing on any Apple gadget you own. You get it.
A lot of people, however, have music in their collections that didn’t come 
from the iTunes Store. Maybe they ripped some audio CDs into their com-
puters. Maybe they acquired some music from, ahem, a friend. 
What a sad situation! You’ve got some of your music available with you on 
your iPad and some that’s stranded at home on your computer.
Enter iTunes Match. It’s an Apple service that lets you store your entire 
collection, including songs that didn’t come from Apple, online, for $25 a 
year.
The iTunes software analyzes the songs in your collection. If it finds a song 
that’s also available in iTunes, then—bing!—that song becomes available 
for your playback pleasure, without your actually having to transfer your 
copy to Apple. Apple says, in effect: “Well, our copy of the song is just 
as good as yours, so you’re welcome to listen to our copy on any of your 
machines.” 

Chapter 15
444
Truth is, in fact, that Apple’s copy is probably better than your copy. You 
get to play back the song at iTunes’ 256 Kbps quality, no matter how 
grungy your copy.
If there’s a song or two in your collection not among Apple’s 20 million 
tracks, then you can upload them to Apple. 
The advantages of forking over the $25 a year are (a) you can listen to 
all your music from any computer/iPad/iPhone, (b) you get that audio-
quality upgrade, (c) you can listen to iTunes Radio without interrup-
tions from ads, and (d) using the song-matching system saves you huge 
amounts of uploading time. (The rival services from Google and Amazon 
require uploading your entire music collection, which can take days.)
The disadvantage: You’re paying $25 a year.
To get started on your iPad, go to SettingsÆiTunes & App Store. Tap 
Subscribe to iTunes Match—and follow the instructions.
Once the synchronization process is done, any songs on the iPad that are 
actually sitting online are marked by a U icon in the Music app. And any 
song you buy on any machine shows up as available to play on any of 
them.
These songs behave exactly like songs that are stored physically on your 
iPad. (In fact, they often are; if you tap a U song to play it, the iPad down-
loads and stores it so it won’t have to bother the next time.)
Tip: Listening to streaming iTunes Match music over a cellular 
connection eats up your monthly data limit fast! To protect yourself, 
turn off SettingsÆiTunes & App StoresÆUse Cellular Data; now you 
can listen only over a WiFi connection.
If you plan to be offline for a while (like on a flight to Tokyo), you can hide 
the online songs by turning off SettingsÆMusicÆShow All Music. 
The Price of Free
A free iCloud account gives you 5 gigabytes of online storage. That may 
not sound like much, especially when you consider how big some music, 
photo, and video files are. 
Fortunately, anything you buy from Apple—like music, apps, books, and 
TV shows—doesn’t count against that 5-gigabyte limit. Neither do the 
photos in your Photo Stream.

iCloud & Continuity
445
So what’s left? Some things that don’t take up much space, like set-
tings, documents, and pictures you take with your iPad, iPhone, or iPod 
Touch—and some things that take up a lot of it, like email, commercial 
movies, and home videos you transferred to the iPad from your computer. 
Anything you put on your iCloud Drive eats up your allotment, too. (Your 
iPad backup might hog space, but you can pare that down in SettingsÆ​
iCloudÆStorageÆManage Storage. Tap an app’s name and then tap Edit.)
You can, of course, expand your storage if you find 5 gigs constricting. 
You can expand it to 20, 50, 500, or 1,000 gigabytes—for $12, $48, $120, 
or $240 a year. You can upgrade your storage online, on your computer, 
or right on the iPad (in SettingsÆ​iCloudÆStorageÆBuy More Storage).
Apple Pay (iPad Air 2, Mini 3)
To most people who’ve even heard of it, “Apple Pay” means paying for 
things at the cash register by waving your iPhone and walking away. 
Unfortunately, that trick depends on a special chip in the latest iPhones: 
the NFC chip (near-field communication), and the iPad doesn’t have it.
There’s another, more obscure aspect to Apple Pay, though, that you can 
use on iPads (the latest models, anyway): paying for stuff you’re buying 
online from within shopping apps. A touch of your finger on the Home 
button (fingerprint reader) is all the identity checking the app needs to do.
The Setup
To set up Apple Pay, you have to teach your iPad about your credit card. 
To do that, open SettingsÆPassbook & Apple Pay. 
Tap Add Credit or Debit Card. (If you haven’t already registered your fin-
gerprint, you’re prodded to do that now. In SettingsÆTouch ID & Passcode, 
turn on Apple Pay. Then tap Add a Fingerprint and follow the instructions.)
Enter your iCloud password when asked.
If you have a credit card on file with Apple already—for buying stuff from 
the iTunes store—you save a few steps by tapping Use Card on File with 
iTunes (next page, top). To confirm that you’re not a bad guy, you then 
have to type in the three- or four-digit security code. Then you’re ready to 
go shopping.
Otherwise, tap Use a Different Credit Card or Debit Card. Now enter the 
card information manually (next page, middle)—or not so manually. If you 
tap s, you can aim the iPad’s camera at whatever Visa, MasterCard, or 
American Express card you use most often. Hold steady until the digits of 

Chapter 15
446
your card blink onto the screen, auto-recognized (bottom). Cool! (You still 
have to type in the security code.)
Next, your bank has to verify that all systems are go for Apple Pay. That 
may involve responding to an email or a text, or typing in a verification 
code. In any case, it’s generally instantaneous.
Note: At the outset, Apple Pay works only with MasterCard, Visa, or 
American Express, and only the ones issued by certain banks. The 
big ones are all on board—Citibank, Chase, Bank of America, and 
so on—and 500 more have agreed to sign on by early 2015.
The Shopping 
Once you’ve set up Apple Pay, you can use iPad or iPhone apps that have 
been upgraded to work with Apple Pay. The time savings: You’re spared 
all that typing of your name, address, and phone number every time you 
buy something.

iCloud & Continuity
447
Instead, when you’re staring at the checkout screen for some app, just tap 
Buy with Apple Pay.
That button appears in a small but growing number of shopping apps, 
including the apps for Amazon, Lowe’s, Panera Bread, Lululemon, 
Airbnb, Apple Store, Disney Store, Fancy, Groupon, Hotel Tonight, Houzz, 
Indiegogo, Lyft, MLB.com, OpenTable, Staples, Starbucks, StubHub, Target, 
Tickets.com, and Uber.
Family Sharing
It might have taken years, but Apple has finally acknowledged a funda-
mental fact of American life: Many of us have families. 
If you have kids, it’s always been a hassle to manage your Apple life. What 
if they want to buy a book, movie, or app? They have to use your credit 
card—and you have to reveal your iCloud password to them. 
Or what if they want to see a movie that you bought? Do they really have 
to buy it again?
Not anymore. Once you’ve turned on Family Sharing and invited your fam-
ily members, here’s how your life will be different:
• One credit card to rule them all. Up to six of you can buy books, 
movies, apps, and music on your master credit card. 

Chapter 15
448
• Ask before buying. When your kids try to buy stuff, your iPad or 
iPhone pops up a permission request. You have to approve each 
purchase.
• Younger Appleheads. Within Family Sharing, you can now create 
Apple accounts for tiny tots; 13 is no longer the age minimum.
• Shared everything. All of you get instant access to one another’s 
music, video, iBooks, and app purchases—again, without having to 
know each other’s Apple passwords.
• Find one another. You can use your iPad to see where your kids are, 
and vice versa (with permission, of course).
• Find one another’s phones and iPads. The miraculous Find My iPhone 
feature (page 438) now works for every iPad and iPhone in the 
family. If your daughter can’t find her iPad, you can find it for her with 
yours.
• Mutual photo album, mutual calendar, and mutual reminders. When 
you turn on Family Sharing, your Photos, Calendar, and Reminders 
apps each sprout a new category that’s preconfigured to permit 
access by everyone in your family.
Setting Up Family Sharing
The setup process means wading through a lot of screens, but at least you 
have to do it only once. You can turn on this feature either on the Mac (in 
System PreferencesÆSet Up Family) or on the iPad itself. Since this book 
is about the iPad, here are the steps to do it that way.
In SettingsÆiCloud, tap Set Up Family Sharing. Click Get Started. Now the 
iPad informs you that you, the sage adult, are going to be the Organizer—
the one with the power, the wisdom, and the credit card. Continue (unless 
it’s listing the wrong Apple ID account, in which case, you can fix it now).
On successive screens, you read about the idea of shared Apple Store 
purchases; you’re shown the credit card that Apple believes you want to 
use; you’re offered the chance to share your location with the others. Each 
time, read and tap Continue.
Finally, you’re ready to introduce the software to your family. 
• If the kid is under 13: Tap the tiny print that says Create an Apple ID 
for a Child. On the screens that follow, you’ll enter the kid’s birth date; 
agree to a Parent Privacy Disclosure screen; enter the security code 
for your credit card (to prove that you’re you, and not, for example, 
your naughty kid); type the kid’s name; set up an iCloud account 
(name, password, three security questions); decide whether or not to 
turn on Ask To Buy (each time your youngster tries to buy something 

iCloud & Continuity

online from Apple, you’ll be asked for permission in a notification); 
decide whether you want the family to be able to see where the kid is 
at all times; and accept a bunch of legalese.
When it’s all over, the lucky kid’s name appears on the Family screen.
• If the kid already has an iCloud account and is standing right there 
with you in person: Tap Add Family Member. Type in her name or 
email address. (Your child’s name must already be in your Contacts; if 
not, go add her first. By the way, you’re a terrible parent.)
She can now enter her iCloud password on your iPad to complete her 
setup. (That doesn’t mean you’ll learn what her password is; your iPad 
stores it but hides it.) On the subsequent screens, you get to confirm 
her email address and let her turn on location sharing. In other words: 
The rest of the family will be able to see where she is (or at least 
where her iPhone or iPad is).
• If the kid isn’t with you at the moment: Click Send an Invitation. 
Your little darling gets an email at that address. He must open it on his 
Apple gadget—the Mail app on the iPad or iPhone, or the Mail pro-
gram on his Mac, for example. 
When he hits View Invitation, he can either enter his iCloud name 
and password (if he has an iCloud account), or get an Apple ID (if he 
doesn’t). 
Once he accepts the invitation, he can choose a picture to represent 
himself; tap Confirm to agree to be in your family; enter his iCloud 
password to share the stuff he’s bought from Apple; agree to Apple’s 
lawyers’ demands; and, finally, opt in to sharing his location with the 
rest of the family.
You can, of course, repeat this cycle to add additional family members, up 
to a maximum of six. Their names and ages appear on the Family screen. 
From here, you can tap someone’s name to perform stunts like these:
• Delete a family member. Man, you guys really don’t get along, do 
you? Anyway, tap Remove.
• Turn Ask To Buy on or off. This option appears when you’ve tapped 
a child’s name on your iPad. If you decide your kid is responsible 
enough not to need your permission for each purchase, you can turn 
this option off. 
Note: If you turn off Ask To Buy for someone after she turns 18, you 
can’t turn it on again.

Chapter 15
450
• Turn Parent/Guardian on or off. This option appears when you’ve 
tapped an adult’s name. It gives Ask To Buy approval privileges to 
someone else besides you—your spouse, for example.
Once kids turn 13, by the way, Apple automatically gives them more con-
trol over their own lives. They can, for example, turn off Ask To Buy them-
selves, on their own phones. They can even express their disgust for you 
by leaving the Family Sharing group. (On her own iPad or iPhone, for 
example, your daughter can visit SettingsÆiCloudÆFamily, tap her name, 
and then tap Leave Family. Harsh!)
Life in Family Sharing
Once everything’s set up, here’s how you and your nutty kids will get along.
• Purchases. Whenever one of your kids (for whom you’ve turned on 
Ask To Buy) tries to buy music, videos, apps, or books from Apple—
even free items—he has to ask you (facing page, left). On your iPad, 
you’re notified about the purchase—and you can decline it or tap 
Review to read about it on its Store page (facing page, right). If it 
seems OK, you can tap Approve. You also have to enter your iCloud 
password, or supply your fingerprint, to prevent your kid from finding 
your iPad and approving his own request.
(If you don’t respond within 24 hours, the request expires. Your kid 
has to ask again.)
Furthermore, each of you can see and download everything that 
everyone else has bought. To do that, open the appropriate app: App 
Store, iTunes Store, or iBooks. Tap Purchased, and then tap the family 
member’s name, to see what she’s got; tap the U to download any 
of it yourself.

iCloud & Continuity
451
Tip: Anything you buy, your kids will see. Keep that in mind when you 
download a book like Tough Love: Sending the Unruly Child to 
Military School.
However, you have two lines of defense. First, you can hide your 
purchases so nobody sees them. On your computer, in iTunes 
(Chapter 14), click iTunes Store; then click the relevant category (!, 
$, whatever). Click Purchased (right side). Point to the thing you 
want to hide, click the —, and click Hide. (On the iPad, you can hide 
only one category: apps. In the App Store app, tap Updates, then 
Purchased, then My Purchases. Swipe to the left across an app’s 
name to reveal a Hide button.)
Second, remember that you can set up parental control on each 
kid’s iPad, shielding their impressionable eyes from rated-R movies 
and stuff. See page 507.
• Where are you? Open the Find My Friends app to see where in town 
(or in the world) your posse is right now. Or go to the Find My iPhone 
app (or Web page; see page 438) to see where their phones or 
iPads are right now, which may or may not be with their owners.
Note: If one of you needs secrecy for the afternoon (Apple sweetly 
gives, as an example, shopping for a gift for your spouse), open 
SettingsÆiCloudÆShare My Location, and turn off the switch. 
Now you’re untrackable until you turn the switch on again.

Chapter 15
452
• Photos, appointments, and reminders. In Calendar, Photos, and 
Reminders, each of you will find a new category, called Family, that’s 
auto-shared among you all. (In Photos, it’s on the Shared tab.) You’re 
all free to make and edit appointments in this calendar, to set up 
reminders in Reminders (“Flu shots after school!”), or to add photos 
or videos (or comments) to this album; everyone else will see the 
changes instantly.
Continuity
Apple products have always been designed to work together. Macs, 
phones, tablets, watches: Similar software, design, wording, philosophy. 
That’s nice for you, of course, because you have less to learn and to trouble-
shoot. But it’s also nice for Apple, because it keeps you in velvet handcuffs; 
pretty soon, you’ve got too much invested in its own product “ecosystem” 
to consider wandering over to a rival.
In iOS 8.1, Apple has taken this gadget symbiosis to an astonishing new 
extreme. If you have an iPhone, it can be an accessory to your iPad. 
Suddenly the iPad can be a speakerphone, using the phone as a wireless 
antenna. Suddenly the iPad can send and receive regular text messages. 
Suddenly AirDrop lets you drag files back and forth, wirelessly, from tab-
let to phone to computer. Suddenly a WiFi-only iPad can get onto the 
Internet with one click, even miles from home.
Apple’s name for this suite of symbiosis is “Continuity.” And once you’ve 
got it set up, the iPad game changes in a big way.
These are the primary rules:
• The iPad and iPhone must be running iOS 8.1 or later. iPads made in 
2012 (4th Generation) and later are eligible.
• The iPad and the phone have to be signed into the same iCloud 
account. (That’s a security thing—it proves that you’re the owner 
of both machines, and therefore unlikely to pose a risk to yourself.) 
You do that in SettingsÆiCloud. But you should also make sure that 
you’ve entered the same iCloud address in SettingsÆMessages and 
SettingsÆFaceTime. 
• For some of these features, Bluetooth must be turned on in 
SettingsÆ​Bluetooth. (The modern Bluetooth—called Bluetooth LE, 
or low energy—doesn’t drain your battery the way it once did, so it’s 
fine to leave it on. But older iPads don’t have Bluetooth LE, so most 
Continuity features work only on 2012 and later iPads.) 

iCloud & Continuity
453
All right. Setup ready? Time to experience some integration!
iPad as Speakerphone
Continuity is responsible for the ability for your iPad to make and take 
phone calls—if you also have an iPhone. See page 122 for details. 
Texting from the iPad
You can send and receive text messages (and picture, audio, and video 
messages) on your iPad, too. See the step-by-steps on page 135.
Instant Hotspot
If you have a cellular iPad, you’re lucky; it can get onto the Internet almost 
anywhere.
If you have a WiFi-only iPad, you can enjoy the same luxury—if you also 
have an iPhone. Thanks to a feature called Instant Hotspot, the phone can 
stay in your pocket. Its name always appears in your iPad’s SettingsÆWiFi 
list, ready for choosing at any time—even if the phone is asleep and locked, 
and even if Personal Hotspot is turned off! Handily enough, the WiFi list 
also shows the phone’s battery and signal status.
To set up this convenient arrangement, see page 349.
Handoff
Handoff is a new feature that passes half-finished documents between the 
phone, the iPad, and the Mac, wirelessly and automatically. 
For example, suppose you’ve been writing an email message on your iPad 
(next page, top). When you then sit at your Mac, a new icon appears on 
the Mac’s Dock (next page, middle). When you tap it, the Mac’s Mail pro-
gram opens, and the half-finished message is there for you to complete 
(bottom).
It doesn’t have to be an email message, either. If you were reading a Web 
page or a Map on your phone, then that icon on the Mac opens the same 
Web page or map. If you were working on a Reminder; a Calendar entry; a 
Contacts entry; a note in Notes; or a document in Keynote, Numbers, or 
Pages; you can open the same in-progress item on the Mac.

Chapter 15
454
And all of it works in the other direction, too. If you’re working on some-
thing on the Mac, but you’re called away, an icon appears on the lower-left 
corner of your iPad’s Lock screen that opens the same item (below). 

iCloud & Continuity
455
Here’s the setup: Once again, both gadgets must be signed into your 
iCloud account. Both must have Bluetooth turned on, and the iPad and 
phone have to be sitting within Bluetooth range of each other (about 30 
feet).
On the iPad and iPhone, the on/off switch is in SettingsÆGeneralÆHandoff 
& Suggested Apps.
On the Mac, open System PreferencesÆGeneral; turn on Allow Handoff 
between this Mac and your iCloud devices.
Now try it out. Start an email message on your phone. Have a look at the 
Dock on your iPad: There, on the Lock screen, is the little icon of whatever 
program can finish the job.
AirDrop Between iPad and Mac
AirDrop has always been pretty great. It lets you shoot photos, videos, 
maps, Contacts cards, PDF files, Word documents, and all kinds of other 
stuff—from one iPad/iPhone to another iPad/iPhone. Wirelessly. Without 
having to set up names, passwords, or permissions. Without even having 
an Internet connection. See page 281 for more on this i-device feature.
There was a similar feature on the Mac, designed to let you shoot files 
wirelessly from one Mac to another.
But until iOS 8 and Yosemite, you couldn’t use AirDrop between a Mac and 
an iPad. And now you can. 
Open whatever it is you want to send to the iPad: a photo, map, Web site, 
contact…anything with a P button.
When you tap P, you see the AirDrop panel—and, after a moment, the 
icons of any nearby Yosemite Macs show up, too. Including yours.
If the Mac’s icon doesn’t show up, it’s probably because its owner hasn’t 
made the Mac discoverable by AirDrop.
Instruct him to open the AirDrop window on his Mac. (Click AirDrop in the 
sidebar of any Finder window.) See the small blue controls at the bottom? 
It governs who can “see” this Mac for AirDrop purposes: No One, Contacts 
Only (that is, people in the iPad’s address book), or Everyone.

Chapter 15
456
Once that’s set up right, that Mac shows up in the iPad’s AirDrop panel 
(“David” in this illustration). Tap the Mac’s round icon. (Unlike the AirDrop 
of Macs gone by, in Yosemite, you don’t have to start by opening the 
AirDrop window.)
The receiving Mac displays a note like this (right):
Click Accept (to download the incoming item to your Mac’s Downloads 
folder) or Decline (to reject it).
Tip: If the iPad and the Mac are both signed into the same iCloud 
account, then you don’t encounter that Accept/Decline thing. The 
file goes directly into your Downloads folder without asking. You 
do get a notification on the Mac that lets you know how many files 
arrived, and it offers an Open button.
Apple figures that, since you own both the iPad and the Mac, the 
usual permission routine isn’t necessary. You’re probably not trying 
to send yourself some evil virus of death.

The Corporate iPhone
457

I
n its younger days, people thought of the iPad as a personal device, 
meant for consumers and not for corporations. But somebody at 
Apple must have gotten sick of hearing, “Well, the iPad is cool, but 
it’s got no place in the workplace.” The iPad now has the security and 
compatibility features your corporate technical overlords require.
Even better, the iPad can talk to Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync servers, 
staples of corporate computer departments that, among other things, 
can keep your tablet wirelessly updated with the calendar, contacts, and 
email back at the office. (Yes, it sounds a lot like MobileMe or iCloud. 
Which is probably why Apple’s MobileMe slogan was “Exchange for the 
rest of us.”)
The Perks
This chapter is intended for you, the iPad owner—not for the highly paid, 
well-trained, exceedingly friendly IT (information technology) managers 
at your company. 
Your first task is to convince them that your iPad is now secure and com-
patible enough to welcome into the company’s network. Here’s some 
information you can use:
• Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. Exchange ActiveSync is the technol-
ogy that keeps smartphones wirelessly synced with the data on the 
mother ship’s computers. The iPad works with Exchange ActiveSync, 
so it can remain in wireless contact with your company’s Exchange 
servers exactly like BlackBerry and Windows Mobile devices do.
Your email, address book, and calendar appointments are now sent 
wirelessly to your iPad so it’s always kept current—and they’re sent in 
a way that those evil rival firms can’t intercept. (It uses 128-bit en-
crypted SSL, if you must know.) 
The Corporate 
iPad

Chapter 16
458
NOTE: That’s the same encryption used by Outlook Web Access (OWA), 
which lets employees check their email, calendar, and contacts 
from any Web browser. In other words, if your IT administrators 
are willing to let you access your data using OWA, then they 
should also be willing to let you access it with the iPad.
• Mass setup. These days, iPads may wind up in corporations in two 
ways: They’re either handed out by the company, or you bring your 
own. (When employees use their own tablets for work, they call it 
BYOD: “Bring your own device.”) 
Most companies set up employee iPads using mobile device manage-
ment (MDM) software. That’s a program (for sale by lots of different 
security companies) that gives your administrators control over a 
huge range of corporate apps, settings, and restrictions: all WiFi, 
network, password, email, and VPN settings; policies about what 
features and apps you can use, and so on; and the ability to remotely 
erase or lock your iPad if it gets lost. Yet MDM programs don’t touch 
the stuff that you install on your own. If you leave the company, your 
old employer can delete all of its own stuff, while preserving your own 
personal stuff.
• Security. The iPad can connect to wireless networks using the latest, 
super-secure connections (WPA Enterprise and WPA2 Enterprise), 
which are highly resistant to hacker attacks. And when you’re using 
virtual private networking, as described at the end of this chapter, you 
can use a very secure VPN protocol called IPSec. That’s what most 
companies use for secure, encrypted remote access to the corporate 
network. Juniper and Cisco VPN apps are available, too.
Speaking of security: Whenever your iPad is locked, iOS 8 automati-
cally encrypts all email, email attachments, Calendar, Contacts, Notes, 
Reminders, and the data of any other apps that are written to take 
advantage of this feature. 
• iOS 8 improvements. Apple beefed up the corporate-iPad thing 
even more in iOS 8. Now you can encrypt individual email messages 
to people in your company (and, with some effort, to people out-
side your company; see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4979). When 
you’re setting up a meeting, you can see your coworkers’ schedules 
in the Calendar app. You can set up an automatic “Out of office” reply 
that’s in force until a certain date. (It’s in SettingsÆMail, Contacts, 
Calendars. Tap your Exchange account’s name and scroll down to 
Automatic Reply.) Lots more control for your IT overlords, too.

The Corporate iPhone
459
And what’s in it for you? Complete synchronization of your email, address 
book, and calendar with what’s on your PC at work. Send an email from 
your iPad; find it in the Sent folder of Outlook at the office. And so on.
You can also accept invitations to meetings on your iPad that are sent 
your way by coworkers; if you accept, these meetings appear on your 
calendar automatically, just as on your PC. You can also search the com-
pany’s master address book, right from your iPad.
The biggest perk for you, though, is just getting permission to use an iPad 
as your company-issued tablet.
Setup 
Your company’s IT squad can set up things on their end by consulting 
Apple’s copious instructions for corporate administrators at www.apple.
com/ipad/business/it/. 
This guide is filled with handy tips, like: “On the Front-End Server, ver-
ify that a server certificate is installed and enable SSL for the Exchange 
ActiveSync virtual directory (require basic SSL authentication).” 
Your IT pros might send you a link that downloads a profile—a preconfig-
ured file that auto–sets up all your company’s security and login informa-
tion. It will create the Exchange account for you (and might turn off a few 
iPad features, like the ability to switch off the passcode requirement).
If, on the other hand, you’re supposed to set up your Exchange account 
yourself, then tap SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarsÆAdd AccountÆ​
Exchange. Fill in your work email address and password as they were pro-
vided to you by your company’s IT person.
And that’s it. Your iPad will shortly bloom with the familiar sight of your 
office email stash, calendar appointments, and contacts. 
Life on the Corporate Network
Once your iPad is set up, you should be in wireless corporate heaven: 
• Email. Your corporate email account shows up among whatever other 
email accounts you’ve set up (Chapter 13). In fact, you can have multi-
ple Exchange accounts on the same iPad. 
Not only is your email “pushed” to the iPad (it arrives as it’s sent, with-
out your having to explicitly check for messages), but it’s also synced 
with what you see on your computer at work. If you send, receive, 
delete, flag, or file any messages on your iPad, you’ll find them sent, 
received, deleted, flagged, or filed on your computer at the office. 
And vice versa. 

Chapter 16
460
All the iPad email niceties described in Chapter 13 are available to 
your corporate mail: opening attachments, rotating and zooming into 
them, and so on. 
Oh—and when you’re addressing an outgoing message, the iPad’s 
autocomplete feature consults both your built-in iPad address book 
and the corporate directory (on the Exchange server) simultaneously. 
Tip: New in iOS 8: Your iPad can warn you when you’re addressing an 
email to somebody outside your company (a security risk, and 
something that sometimes arises from autocomplete accidents). 
To turn on this feature, open SettingsÆMail, Contacts, Calendars. 
Scroll down; tap Mark Addresses. Type in your company’s email 
suffix (like yourcompany.com). From now on, whenever you address 
an outgoing message to someone outside yourcompany.com, it 
appears in red in the “To:” line to catch your eye.
• Contacts. In the address book, you gain a new superpower: You can 
search your company’s master name directory right from the iPad. 
That’s great when you need to track down, say, the art director in your 
Singapore branch.
To perform this search, tap Contacts on the Home screen. Tap the 
Groups button in the upper-left corner. On the Groups screen, your 
company’s name appears; it may contain some group names of its 
own. But below these, a new entry appears that mere mortal iPad 
owners never see. It might say something like Directory or Global 
Address Book. Tap it.

The Corporate iPhone
461
On the following screen, start typing the name of the person you’re 
looking up; the resulting matches appear as you type. (Or type the 
whole name and then tap Search.) 
In the list of results, tap the name you want. That person’s Info screen 
appears so you can tap to compose a preaddressed email message. 
• Calendar. Your iPad’s calendar is wirelessly kept in sync with the mas-
ter calendar back at the office. If you’re on the road and your minions 
make changes to your schedule in Outlook, you’ll know about it; you’ll 
see the change on your iPad’s calendar.
There are some other changes to your calendar, too, as you’ll find out 
in a moment.
Tip: Don’t forget that you can save battery power, syncing time, and 
mental clutter by limiting how much old calendar stuff gets synced 
to your iPad. (How often do you really look back on your calendar to 
see what happened more than a month ago?) Page 490 has the 
details.
• Notes. If your company uses Exchange 2010 or later, your notes are 
synced with Outlook on your Mac or PC, too.
Exchange + Your Stuff 
The iPad can display calendar and contact information from multiple 
sources at once—your Exchange calendar/address book and your own 
personal data, for example. 
Here’s how it works: Open your iPad calendar. Tap Calendars. Now you’re 
looking at all the accounts your iPad knows about; you might find separate 
headings for iCloud, Yahoo, Gmail, and so on, each with calendar catego-
ries listed under it. And one of them is your Exchange account.
You can pull off a similar stunt in Contacts, Notes, and Reminders. 
Whenever you’re looking at your list of contacts, for example, you can tap 
the Groups button (top left of the screen). Here, once again, you can tap 
All Contacts to see a combined address book—or you can look over only 
your iCloud contacts, your Exchange contacts, your personal contacts, 
and so on. Or tap [group name] to view only the people in your tennis cir-
cle, book club, or whatever (if you’ve created groups); or [your Exchange 
account name] to search only the company listings.

Chapter 16
462
Invitations
If you’ve spent much time in the world of Microsoft Outlook (that is, cor-
porate America), then you already know about invitations. These are elec-
tronic invitations that coworkers send you directly from Outlook. When 
you get one of these invitations by email, you can click Accept, Decline, 
or Maybe. 
If you click Accept, then the meeting gets dropped onto the proper date 
in your Outlook calendar, and your name gets added to the list of attend-
ees maintained by the person who invited you. If you click Maybe, then 
the meeting is flagged that way, on both your calendar and the sender’s.
Exchange meeting invitations on the iPad show up in four places, just to 
make sure you don’t miss them. You get a standard iPad notification, a 
numbered “badge” on the Calendar app’s icon on the Home screen, as 
an attachment to a message in your corporate email account, and in the 
Calendar app—tap Inbox at the lower-right corner. Tapping Inbox shows 
the Invitations list, which summarizes all invitations you’ve accepted, 
maybe’d, or not responded to yet. Tap one to see the details (facing page, 
left).

The Corporate iPhone
463
Tip: Invitations you haven’t dealt with also show up on the Calendar’s 
List view or Day view with dotted shading (below, right). That’s the 
iPad’s clever way of showing you just how severely your workday 
will be ruined if you accept this meeting.
You can also generate invitations. When you’re filling out the Info form for 
a new appointment, you get a field called Invitees. Tap there to enter the 
email addresses of the people you’d like to invite. 
Your invitation will show up in whatever calendar programs your invitees 
use, and they’ll never know you didn’t send it from some corporate copy 
of Microsoft Outlook.
A Word on Troubleshooting
If you’re having trouble with your Exchange syncing and can’t find any 
steps that work, then ask your Exchange administrators to make sure that 
ActiveSync’s settings are correct on their end. You’ve heard the old saying 
that in 99 percent of computer troubleshooting, the problem lies between 
the keyboard and the chair? The other 1 percent of the time, it’s between 
the administrator’s keyboard and chair.
Tip: You can access your company’s SharePoint sites, too. That’s a 
Microsoft document-collaboration feature that’s also a common part 
of corporate online life.
The iPad’s browser can access these sites; it can also open Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF documents you find there. Handy 
indeed!

Chapter 16
464
Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
The typical corporate network is guarded by a team of steely-eyed admin-
istrators for whom Job One is preventing access by unauthorized visitors. 
They perform this job primarily with the aid of a super-secure firewall that 
seals off the company’s network from the Internet.
So how can you tap into the network from the road? Only one solution 
is both secure and cheap: the virtual private network, or VPN. Running 
a VPN lets you create a super-secure “tunnel” from your iPad, across 
the Internet, and straight into your corporate network. All data passing 
through this tunnel is heavily encrypted. To the Internet eavesdropper, it 
looks like so much undecipherable gobbledygook.
VPN is, however, a corporate tool, run by corporate nerds. Your company’s 
tech staff can tell you whether or not there’s a VPN server set up for you 
to use.
If there is one, then you’ll need to know what type of server it is. The iPad 
can connect to VPN servers that speak PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling 
Protocol) and L2TP/IPSec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol over the IP Security 
Protocol), both relatives of the PPP language spoken by modems. Most 
corporate VPN servers work with at least one of these protocols. 
The iPad can also connect to Cisco servers, which are among the most 
popular systems in corporate America, and, with a special app, Juniper’s 
Junos Pulse servers, too.
To set up your VPN connection, visit SettingsÆGeneralÆVPN. 
Here you may see that your overlords have already set up some VPN con-
nections; tap the one you want to use. You can also set one up yourself, by 
tapping Add VPN Configuration at the bottom.
Tap L2TP, PPTP, or IPSec (that’s the Cisco one), depending on which kind 
of server your company uses (ask the network administrator). Fill in the 
Server address, the account name and password, and the Shared Secret 
password; your system administrators can tell you what these are.
Once everything is in place, the iPad can connect to the corporate net-
work and fetch your corporate mail. You don’t have to do anything special 
on your end; everything works just as described in this chapter.

The Corporate iPhone
465
Note: Some networks require that you type the currently displayed 
password on an RSA SecurID token, which your administrator 
will provide. This James Bondish thing looks like either a credit 
card or a USB drive. It displays a password that changes every 
few seconds, making it rather difficult for hackers to learn “the” 
password.
VPN on Demand
If you like to access your corporate email or internal Web site a few times 
a day, having to enter your name-and-password credentials over and over 
again can get old fast. Fortunately, iOS offers a huge time-saving assist 
with VPN on Demand. 
That is, you just open up Safari and tap the corporate bookmark; the iPad 
creates the VPN channel automatically, behind the scenes, and connects.
There’s nothing you have to do, or even anything you can do, to make this 
feature work; your company’s network nerds have to turn this feature on 
at their end.
They’ll create a configuration profile that you’ll install on your iPad. It 
includes the VPN server settings, an electronic security certificate, and 
a list of domains and URLs that will automatically turn on the iPad’s VPN 
feature.

Chapter 16
466
When your iPad goes to sleep, it terminates the VPN connection, both for 
security purposes and to save battery power.
Note: Clearly, eliminating the VPN sign-in process also weakens the 
security the VPN was invented for in the first place. Therefore, 
you’d be well advised—and probably required by your IT team—
to use the iPad’s password or fingerprint feature, so some evil 
corporate spy (or teenage thug) can’t just steal your iPad and 
start snooping through the corporate servers.

T
he Settings app is like the Control Panel in Windows or System 
Preferences on the Mac. It’s a tweaking center that affects every 
aspect of the iPad: the screen, ringtones, email, Web connection, 
and so on. 
In this book, you can read about the iPad’s preference settings in the 
appropriate spots—wherever they’re relevant. And the Control Center, of 
course, is designed to eliminate trips into Settings.
But so you’ll have it all in one place, here’s an item-by-item walkthrough 
of the Settings app and its structure in iOS 8.

Two Settings Tricks
The Settings app starts as a master list of panels—left side; tap the Settings 
category (Notifications or General, let’s say) to view the corresponding 
options on the right portion of the screen.
Even then, you may find that you’re not done “drilling down.” You may 
have to tap, for example, General, then Keyboard, then Shortcuts, burrow-
ing deeper into that right-side pane each time. It’s a lot of navigation.
Fortunately, you have two kinds of shortcuts.
First, you can “back out” to an earlier Settings screen by tapping the ” 
button in the upper-left corner.
Second, you can jump directly to a particular Settings screen—from within 
any app—using Siri (Chapter 3). You can say, for example, “Open Sound 
settings,” “Open Brightness settings,” “Open Notification settings,” “Open 
WiFi settings,” and so on. Siri promptly takes you to the corresponding 
screen—no tapping required.
Airplane Mode
As you’re probably aware, you’re not allowed to make cellular connec-
tions on U.S. airplanes. The WiFi-only iPad is fine at any time in flight—but 
according to legend (if not science), a cellular iPad’s radio can interfere 
with a plane’s navigation equipment.
But a cellular iPad does a lot more than get online. Are you supposed to 
deprive yourself of all the music, videos, movies, and email that you could 
be using in flight, just because cell signals are forbidden?
Swipe to 
go back

Settings
469
Nope. Just turn on Airplane mode by tapping the switch at the top of the 
Settings list (so the switch background turns green). The word Cellular 
dims there in Settings (you’ve turned off your cellular circuitry). The WiFi 
and Bluetooth switches turn off, too—but you’re now welcome to switch 
them back on even while in Airplane mode.
Now it’s safe (and permitted) to use the iPad in flight, because its cellular 
features are turned off completely. You can’t get online on the cellular net-
work, but you can do anything else in the iPad’s bag of tricks (including 
getting online with WiFi, if the plane has it).
Tip: Turning Airplane mode on and off is faster if you use the Control 
Center (page 37). Same for WiFi, described next.
WiFi
This item in Settings opens the WiFi Networks screen, where you’ll find 
three useful controls:
• WiFi On/Off. If you don’t plan to use WiFi, then turning it off gets you 
more life out of each battery charge. Tap anywhere on this On/Off 
slider to change its status.
Tip: Turning on Airplane mode automatically turns off the WiFi 
antenna—but you can turn WiFi back on. That’s handy when you’re 
on a flight with WiFi on board.
• Choose a Network. Here’s a list of all nearby WiFi networks that the 
iPad can “see,” complete with a signal-strength indicator and a pad-
lock icon if a password is required. An Other item lets you access WiFi 
networks that are invisible and secret unless you know their names. 
See Chapter 11 for details on using WiFi with the iPad.
• Ask to Join Networks. If this option is On, then the iPad is continu-
ously sniffing around to find a WiFi network. If it finds one you haven’t 
used before, a small dialog box invites you to hop onto it. 
So why would you ever want to turn this feature off? To avoid getting 
bombarded with invitations to join WiFi networks, which can happen 
in heavily populated areas, and to save battery power. (The iPad will 
still hop automatically onto hotspots it’s joined in the past, and you 
can still view a list of available hotspots by opening SettingsÆWiFi.)

Carrier
If you see this panel at all, then you’re triply lucky. First, you have a cellu-
lar iPad. Second, you’re enjoying a trip overseas. Third, you have a choice 
of cellphone carriers who have roaming agreements with AT&T, Verizon, 
T-Mobile, or Sprint. Tap your favorite and prepare to pay some serious 
roaming fees.
Bluetooth
Here’s the on/off switch for the iPad’s Bluetooth transmitter, which is 
required to communicate with a Bluetooth speaker, earpiece, keyboard, 
laptop (for tethering), or hands-free system in a car. When you turn the 
switch on, you’re offered the chance to pair the iPad with other Bluetooth 
equipment; the paired gadgets are listed here for ease of connecting and 
disconnecting.
Tip: The Control Center (page 37) has a Bluetooth button. It’s faster 
to use that than to visit Settings.
Cellular Data (Cellular iPads)
These days, not many cellular plans let you use the Internet as much as you 
want; most have monthly limits. For example, $20 a month might include 4 
gigabytes of Internet data use.
Most of the settings on this screen are meant to help you control how 
much Internet data your cellular iPad uses:
• Cellular Data. This is the on/off switch for Internet data. If you’re 
traveling overseas, you might want to turn this off to avoid racking up 
insanely high roaming charges. Your cellular iPad becomes a WiFi-
only iPad.
• Enable LTE. Every now and then, you’ll be in some area where you 
can’t connect to the Internet even though you seem to have an LTE 
signal; forcing your iPad to the 4G or 3G network often gives you at 
least some connection. Turning LTE off does just that. (Not available 
on iPad 2.)
• Data Roaming. This control can prevent staggering international 
roaming fees. On AT&T or T-Mobile, you can turn off Data Roaming 
(when you’re out of the country, you won’t get slapped with outra-
geous Internet fees).

Settings
471
• Personal Hotspot. Here’s where you go the very first time you turn 
on Personal Hotspot (page 346). Once that’s done, a new Personal 
Hotspot on/off switch appears on the main Settings screen, so you 
won’t have to dig this deep in the future. (Not available on iPad 2.)
• SIM PIN. Your SIM card (on cellular iPads) stores all your account 
information. SIM cards are especially desirable abroad, because in 
most countries, you can pop yours into any old cellular iPad and have 
working service. If you’re worried about yours getting stolen or lost, 
then turn this option on. You’ll be asked to enter a passcode.
Then, if some bad guy ever tries to put your SIM card into another 
iPad, he’ll be asked for the password. Without the password, the card 
(and the iPad) won’t get online over the cellular airwaves. 
Tip: And if the evildoer guesses wrong three times, the words “PIN 
LOCKED” appear on the screen, and the SIM card is locked forever. 
You’ll have to get another one from AT&T or whatever. So don’t 
forget the password.
• Cellular Data Usage. The iPad also helps you track how much Internet 
data you’ve used this month, expressed as megabytes of data, includ-
ing email messages and Web page material. These are extremely 
important statistics, because your iPad plan is probably capped at, for 
example, 2 gigabytes a month. If you exceed your monthly maximum, 

Chapter 17
472
you’re instantly charged $15 or $20 for another chunk of data. So 
keeping an eye on these statistics is a very good idea. 
(The Current Period means so far this month; Current Period Roaming 
means overseas or in places where your cell company doesn’t have 
service.)
Now, your cell company is supposed to alert you as you get closer 
and closer to your monthly limit—but in iOS 8, you can check your 
Internet spending at any time.
• Use cellular data for: This list offers individual on/off switches for 
every single Internet-using app on your iPad. Each one is an item 
that could consume Internet data without your awareness. Now, at 
last, you can shut up the data hogs you really don’t feel like spending 
megabytes on.
VPN 
VPN stands for virtual private networking, a secure way for you to connect 
to a corporate network from the road. You can read more about it on page 
464. On this screen, you see a list of whatever VPN connections you or 
some network administrator you love set up, ready to use.
Personal Hotspot
Once you’ve turned this feature on (page 346) in Cellular, this command 
appears here, too—on the main Settings screen for your convenience.
Notifications
This panel lists all the apps that think they have the right to nag for your 
attention. Flight-tracking programs alert you that there’s an hour before 
takeoff. Social-networking programs ping you when someone’s trying to 
reach you. Games let you know when it’s your move. Instant-messaging 
apps ding to let you know that you have a new message. It can add up to 
a lot of interruption.
On this panel, you can tailor, to an almost ridiculous degree, how you want 
to be nagged. See Chapter 1 for a complete description.

Settings
473
Control Center
The Control Center is written up on page 37. There are two settings 
to change here. If you turn off Access on Lock Screen, then the Control 
Center isn’t available on the iPad’s Lock screen. No passing prankster can 
change your iPad’s settings without your password.
And if you turn off Access Within Apps, then you won’t land in the Control 
Center by accident when you’re playing some game that involves a lot of 
swiping.
Do Not Disturb
Ah, yes, here it is: one of iOS’s most useful features. See page 482.
General
The General pages offer a huge, motley assortment of settings governing 
the behavior of the virtual keyboard, Siri, the password-protection feature, 
and about 6 trillion other things:
• About. Tapping this item opens a page for the statistics nut. Here you 
can find out how many songs, videos, and photos your iPad holds; 
how much storage your iPad has; techie details like the iPad’s soft-
ware and firmware versions, serial number, model, WiFi and Bluetooth 
addresses, and so on. (It’s kind of cool to see how many applications 
you’ve installed.)
At the very top, you can tap the iPad’s name to rename it. 
• Software Update. When 
Apple releases a new 
software update for your 
iPad, you can download 
it directly to the iPad. You 
no longer need to con-
nect to a Mac or a PC for 
that job.
You’ll know when an 
update is waiting for you, 
because you’ll see a little 
number badge on the 
Settings icon, as well as 
on the word General in 

Chapter 17
474
Settings. Tap it, and then tap Software Update, to see and install the 
update. (If no number badge is waiting, then tapping Software Up-
date just shows you your current iOS version.)
• Siri. Here’s the master on/off switch for Siri, the voice-commanded 
virtual-assistant feature, and the on/off switch for the hands-free “Hey, 
Siri” feature. Both are described in Chapter 3. (Unavailable on the 
iPad 2.)
Also on this panel: a choice of languages; a Voice Gender setting 
(male or female); an option to have Siri’s respon­ses read aloud only 
when you’re on headset (so you don’t disturb those around you); an 
option to choose your own Contacts card, so Siri knows, for example, 
where to go when you say, “Give me directions home.” 
• Spotlight Search. Here you can control which kinds of things 
Spotlight finds when it searches your iPad. Tap to turn off the kinds of 
data you don’t want it to search: Mail, Notes, Calendar, whatever. 
Tip: You can also drag these categories into a new order, using the 
little H as a handle. Why? Because that’s the order that things will 
appear in the results list when you actually perform a search. If you 
mainly search your text messages, for example, then by all means 
drag Messages to the top of the list, so they’ll appear first.
• Handoff & Suggested Apps. Handoff is the new iOS 8 feature for 
people who own both an iPhone and an iPad or Mac; it automatically 
passes half-finished documents between them when you come home, 
as described on page 453. This is the on/off switch. (Not available 
on iPad 2 or 3rd Generation.)
The Suggested Apps feature really has no business being on the same 
screen—it’s unrelated. It’s the new iOS 8 feature that displays the faint 
icon of an app that might be useful right now, based on where you 
are (an airline’s app when you’re in the airport, for example). Here you 
can turn that feature off, both for apps you already have on the iPad 
(My Apps) and apps that Apple thinks you might like to download 
(App Store).
• Use side switch to: Every iPad except the Air 2 has a tiny switch on 
the right top edge. It can be either a Mute switch (the iPad makes no 
sounds) or a Lock Rotation switch (the picture doesn’t turn when the 
tablet does). Here’s where you make your choice. (Whichever function 
you don’t choose here becomes a button in your Control Center.)
• Accessibility. These options are intended for people with visual, hear-
ing, and motor impairments, but they might come in handy now and 
then for almost anyone. All these features are described in Chapter 6.

Settings
475
• Usage. This screen is proof that the iPad is an obsessive-compulsive. 
You find out here that it knows everything about you, your apps, and 
your iPad activity.
For example, the new Battery Usage screen shows which apps are 
killing your battery life (see page 34). The Usage readout here 
shows, in hours and minutes, how much time you’ve spent using all 
iPad functions since the last time it was charged up (although it’s not 
broken down by activity, alas). Standby is how much time the iPad 
has spent in Sleep mode. 
Battery Percentage adds a digital readout to the battery gauge on 
your status bar (for example, 65%).
The Storage section shows how much of your iPad’s storage space 
is currently used and free. Tap Manage Storage to see a list of every 
single app on your iPad, along with how much space it’s eating up. 
(Biggest apps are at the top.) Better yet, you can tap an app to see 
how much it and its associated documents consume—and, for apps 
you’ve installed yourself, there’s a Delete App button staring you in 
the face. 
The idea, of course, is that if you’re running out of space on your iPad, 
this display makes it incredibly easy to see what the space hogs are—
and delete them.
The next section, iCloud, also reports on storage—but in this case, it 
shows you how much storage you’re using on your iCloud account. 
(Remember, you get 5 gigabytes free; after that, you have to pay.) If 
you tap Manage Storage, you get to see how much of that space is 
used up by which apps—Mail is usually one of the biggest offenders.
• Background App Refresh. The list that appears here identifies apps 
that try to access the Internet to update themselves, even when 
they’re in the background. Since such apps can drain your battery, 
you have the option here to block their background updating.
You can also turn off the master Background App Refresh switch 
here. Now the only apps that can get online in the background are a 
standard limited suite (music playback and GPS, for example). 
• Auto-Lock. As you may have noticed, the iPad locks itself after a few 
minutes of inactivity on your part. In locked mode, the iPad ignores 
screen taps. Without this mode, reaching into your bag for a wallet or 
a pen could, at least theoretically, fire up some iPad program or even 
dial a call. 
On the Auto-Lock screen, you can change the interval of inactivity 
before the auto-lock occurs (1 minute, 2 minutes, and so on), or you 

Chapter 17
476
can tap Never. In that case, the iPad locks only when you click it to 
sleep.
• Restrictions. This means “parental controls.” (Apple called it 
“Restrictions” instead so as not to turn off potential corporate cus-
tomers. Can’t you just hear it? “ ‘Parental controls?’  This thing is for 
consumers?!”) Complete details appear on page 507.
• Date & Time. Here you can turn on 24-hour time, also known as mili-
tary time, in which you see “1700” instead of “5:00 PM.” (You’ll see this 
change everywhere times appear, including at the top of the screen.)
Set Automatically refers to the iPad’s built-in clock. If this item is 
turned on, then the iPad finds out what time it is from an atomic clock 
out on the Internet. If not, then you have to set the clock yourself. 
(Turning this option off produces two more rows of controls: The 
Time Zone option becomes available, so you can specify your time 
zone, and a “number spinner” appears so you can set the clock.)
• Keyboard. Here you can turn off some of the very best features of 
the iPad’s virtual keyboard. (All these shortcuts are described in 
Chapter 2.)
It’s hard to imagine why you wouldn’t want any of these tools working 
for you and saving you time and keystrokes, but here you go: Auto-
Capitalization is where the iPad thoughtfully capitalizes the first letter 
of every new sentence for you. Auto-Correction is where the iPad 
suggests spelling corrections as you type. Check Spelling, of course, 
refers to the pop-up spelling suggestions. Enable Caps Lock is the on/
off switch for the Caps Lock feature, in which a fast double-tap on the 
Shift key turns on Caps Lock. 
Predictive refers to QuickType, the row of three word candidates 
that appears above the keyboard when you’re typing. Split Keyboard 
refers to the thumb-typing keyboard described on page 58; if you 
find yourself invoking that keyboard accidentally, turn it off here.
The “.” Shortcut switch turns on or off the “type two spaces to make 
a period” shortcut for the ends of sentences, and Enable Dictation is 
the on/off switch for the ability to dictate text. (If you never use dicta-
tion, turning this switch off hides the ß button on the keyboard, giving 
the space bar more room to breathe.)
• Language & Region. The iPad: It’s not just for Americans anymore. 
The iPad Language screen lets you choose a language for the iPad’s 
menus and messages. Region Formats controls how the iPad displays 
dates, times, and numbers. (For example, in the U.S., Christmas is on 
12/25; in Europe, it’s 25/12.)

Settings
477
Calendar lets you choose which kind of calendar system you want 
to use: Gregorian (that is, “normal”), Japanese, or Buddhist. Finally, 
the Advanced screen lets you turn off the automatic setting of date, 
time, and number languages to match your main iPad language. You 
know—for people who want their dates, times, and numbers in a dif-
ferent language.
• iTunes Wi-Fi Sync. You can sync your iPad with a computer wire-
lessly, as long as the iPad is plugged in and on WiFi. Details on page 
416.
• VPN. See Chapter 16 for details on virtual private networking.
• Reset. On the all-powerful Reset screen, you’ll find seven ways to 
erase your iPad. 
Reset All Settings takes all the iPad’s settings back to the way they 
were when it came from Apple. Your data, music, and videos remain 
in place, but the settings all go back to their factory settings.
Erase All Content and Settings is the one you want when you sell your 
iPad, or when you’re captured by the enemy and want to make sure 
they will learn nothing from you or your iPad.
NOTE: This feature takes awhile to complete—and that’s a good thing. 
The iPad doesn’t just delete your data; it also overwrites the 
newly erased memory with gibberish to make sure the bad guys 
can’t see any of your deleted info, even with special hacking tools.
Reset Network Settings makes the iPad forget all the memorized WiFi 
networks it currently autorecognizes. 
Subscriber Services does nothing on most modern iPads; it’s left over 
from older Verizon cellular iPad models.
Reset Keyboard Dictionary has to do with the iPad’s autocorrection 
feature, which kicks in whenever you’re trying to input text. Ordinar-
ily, every time you type something the iPad doesn’t recognize—some 
name or foreign word, for example—and you don’t accept the iPad’s 
suggestion, it adds the word you typed to its dictionary so it doesn’t 
bother you with a suggestion again the next time. If you think you’ve 
entered too many words that aren’t legitimate terms, you can delete 
from its little brain all the new “words” you’ve taught it.
Reset Home Screen Layout undoes any icon moving you’ve done on 
the Home screen. It also consolidates all your Home screen icons, 
fitting them onto as few screens as possible.

Chapter 17
478
Finally, Reset Location & Privacy refers to the “OK to use location ser-
vices?” warning that appears whenever an iPad program, like Maps or 
Camera, tries to figure out where you are. This button makes the iPad 
forget all your responses to those permission boxes. In other words, 
you’ll be asked permission all over again the first time you use each of 
those programs. 
Display & Brightness
In iOS 8, Apple moved these controls out of the swamp of the General set-
tings—and gave them a place of proper honor.
Ordinarily, the iPad controls its own screen brightness. An ambient-light 
sensor hidden behind the glass at the top of the iPad’s face samples the 
room brightness each time you wake the iPad and adjusts the screen: 
brighter in bright rooms, dimmer in darker ones.
When you prefer more manual control, here’s what you can do:
• Brightness slider. Drag the handle on this slider to control the screen 
brightness manually, keeping in mind that more brightness means 
shorter battery life. 
If Auto-Brightness is turned on, then the changes you make here are 
relative to the iPad’s self-chosen brightness. In other words, if you 
goose the brightness by 20 percent, then the screen will always be 20 
percent brighter than the iPad would have chosen for itself.
Tip: The Control Center (page 37) gives you a much quicker road to 
the Brightness slider. This version in Settings is just for old-timers.
• Auto-Brightness On/Off. Tap anywhere on this switch to disable the 
ambient-light sensor completely. Now the brightness of the screen is 
under complete manual control. 
• Text Size. Apple has finally realized what anyone over 40 already 
knows: As you age, small type becomes harder to read. This universal 
text-size slider can boost the size of text in every app on your iPad.
Technically, what you’re seeing is the front end for Apple’s Dynamic 
Type feature. And even more technically, not all apps work with Dy-
namic Type (yet). But most of the built-in Apple apps do—Contacts, 
Mail, Maps, Messages, Notes, Phone, Reminders, and Safari Reader—
and other software companies will follow suit.

Settings
479
Tip: If the largest type setting here still isn’t big enough, you’re not out 
of luck. Hiding in the Accessibility panel described on page 153, 
there’s an option called Larger Type. Tap it and then turn on Larger 
Dynamic Type to make the large end of the type-size scale twice as 
big. Now you can read the iPad from the moon.
• Bold Text. If the spindly fonts of iOS 8 are a little too light for your 
reading tastes, you can flip this switch on (see page 163). After 
restarting, the iPad makes everything a little bolder.
Wallpaper
Wallpaper can mean either the photo on the Unlock screen (what you see 
when you wake the iPad up), or the background picture on your Home 
screen. On this panel, you can change the image used for either one. Page 
244 has step-by-step instructions.
Sounds
Here’s where you choose a ringtone sound for incoming FaceTime or 
Continuity calls:
• Ringer and Alerts. The slider here controls the volume of the iPad’s 
ringing. 
Of course, it’s usually faster to adjust the ring volume by pressing 
the up/down buttons on the left edge whenever you’re not on a call 
or playing music or video. But if you find that your volume buttons 
are getting pressed accidentally, you can also turn off Change with 
Buttons. Now you can adjust the volume only with this slider, here in 
Settings.
• Sounds. The sound the iPad makes when it rings is up to you; by 
tapping Ringtone, you can view the iPad’s list of 27 built-in ringtones, 
plus 13 “alert tones,” plus any new ones you’ve added yourself. 
Tap a ring sound to hear it. After you’ve tapped one you like, confirm 
your choice by tapping Sounds to return to the Sounds screen. 
NOTE: You can choose a different ringtone for each person in your 
Contacts (page 129).

Chapter 17
480
But why stop with a ringtone? The iPad can make all kinds of other 
sounds to alert you: to the arrival of a new text message or email; to 
the successful sending of an outgoing email message, tweet, or Face-
book post; to Calendar or Reminders alarms; to the arrival of AirDrop 
files; and so on.
This is a big deal—not just because you can express your individuality 
through your choice of ringtones, text tones, reminder tones, and so 
on, but also because you can distinguish your iPad’s blips and bleeps 
from somebody else’s in the same family or workplace.
For each of these events, tap the light-gray text that identifies the 
current sound for that event (“Tri-tone” or “Ding,” for example). On 
the resulting screen, tap the different sound options to find one you 
like; then tap Sounds to return to the main Sounds screen.
On that Sounds screen, you can also turn on or off the Lock Sounds 
(the sounds you get when you tap the Sleep/Wake switch on the top 
of the iPad) and the Keyboard Clicks that play when you type on the 
virtual keyboard. 
Touch ID & Passcode
Here’s where you set up a password for your iPad, or (if you have an iPad 
Air 2 or mini 3) where you teach the iPad to recognize your fingerprints. 
Full details appear at the end of Chapter 1.

Settings
481
Privacy
By “privacy,” Apple means “apps and Apple accessing your data.” 
Many an app works better, or claims to, when it has access to your address 
book, calendar, photos, and so on. Generally, when you run such an app 
for the first time, it explicitly asks you for permission to access each kind 
of data. But here, on this panel, you have a central dashboard—and on/off 
switches—for each data type and the apps that want it.
Location Services
Suppose, for example, that you tap Location Services. At the top of the 
next screen, you’ll find the master on/off switch for all Location Services. 
If you turn it off, then the iPad can no longer determine where you are on 
a map, geotag your photos, find the closest ATM, tell your friends where 
you’re hanging out, and so on. Below this master switch, you’ll find these 
options:
• Share My Location. Every year, Apple comes up with new ways for 
you to broadcast your iPad’s location—and, by extension, your own. 
For example, Find My Friends, Messages, and Family Sharing all have 
features that let certain other people (with your permission) see 
where you are right now.
Here’s the on/off switch for the whole feature. If it’s off, nobody can 
find you right now. If Share My Location is on, then this screen also 
shows you the names of people to whom you’ve given permission to 
track you—a handy reminder.
• App Store, Camera, Maps…. This screen goes on to list every single 
app that uses your location information, and it lets you turn off this 
feature on a by-app basis. You might want to do that for privacy’s 
sake—or you might want to do that to save battery power, since the 
location searches sap away a little juice every time. 
Tap an app’s name to see when it wants access to your location. You 
might see Always, Never, or While Using the App (the app can’t use 
your location when it’s in the background). On the same screen, you 
can see a description of why the app thinks it needs your location. 
Why does the Calendar need it, for example? “To estimate travel times 
to events.”

Chapter 17
482
The little ˜ icon indicates which apps have actually used your loca-
tion data. If it’s gray, that app has checked your location in the past 24 
hours; if it’s purple, it’s locating you right now; if it’s hollow, that app 
is using a geofence—it’s waiting for you to enter or leave a certain 
location, like Home or Work. The Reminders app uses the geofencing 
feature, for example.
• System Services. Here are the on/off switches for the iPad features 
that use your location. 
A few examples: Cell Network Search (lets a cellular iPad tap into 
Apple’s database of cellular frequencies by location, which speeds up 
connections); Location-Based iAds (advertisements that Apple slaps 
at the bottom of certain apps—or, rather, their ability to self-customize 
based on your current location); Setting Time Zone (permits the iPad 
to set its own clock when you arrive in a new time zone.
In the Product Improvement list, the options include Diagnostics and 
Usage (sends location information back to Apple, along with diagnos-
tic information so that, for example, Apple can see where calls are be-
ing dropped); Popular Near Me (the section of the App Store that lists 
apps downloaded by people around your current spot); Routing & 
Traffic (sends anonymous speed/location data from your iPad, which 
is how Maps knows where there are traffic tie-ups); and so on.
Contacts, Calendars, Reminders…
This list (on the main Privacy screen) identifies the kinds of data that 
your apps might wish to access; we’re going way beyond location here. 
For example, your apps might want to access your address book or your 
calendar.

merrily tapping into its data. And to see the on/off switch, which you can

Similarly, new apps you download may sometimes want access to your 
Facebook and Twitter accounts. Lots of apps, for example, harness your 
existing Facebook account for the purpose of logging in or finding friends 
to play games with. Tap Twitter or Facebook to see which apps are using 
your account information.
Diagnostics & Usage
Do you give Apple permission to collect information about how you’re 
using your iPad and how well the iPad is behaving each day? On this 
screen, you can choose Don’t Send or Automatically Send. And if you tap 
Diagnostic & Usage Data at the bottom, you can see the actual data the 
iPad intends to send. (Hint: It’s programmery gibberish.)
Advertising
The final Privacy option gives you a Limit Ad Tracking switch. Turning it 
on won’t affect how many ads you see within your apps—but it will pre-
vent advertisers from delivering ads based on your interests. You’ll just 
get generic ads.
There’s a Reset Advertising Identifier button here, too. You may not real-
ize that, behind the scenes, you have an Ad Identifier number. It’s “a non-
permanent, non-personal device identifier” that advertisers can associate 
with you and your habits—the things you buy, the apps you use, and so on. 
That way, the advertisers can insert ads into your apps that pertain to your 
interests—without ever knowing your name. 
But suppose you’ve been getting a lot of ads that seem to mischaracterize 
your interests. Maybe you’re a rustic shepherd, and you keep seeing ads 
for hyperviolent games. Or maybe you’re a nun, and you keep getting ads 
for marital aids. 
In those cases, you might want to reset your Ad ID with this button, thus 
starting from scratch as a brand-new person about which the advertisers 
know nothing.
iCloud
Here’s where you enter your iCloud name and password—and where you 
find the on/off switches for the various kinds of data synchronization that 
iCloud can perform for you. Chapter 15 tells all.

iTunes & App Store
If you’ve indulged in a few downloads (or a few hundred) from the App 
Store or iTunes music store, then you may well find some settings of use 
here. For example, if you tap your Apple ID at the top of the panel, you get 
these buttons:
• View Apple ID. This takes you to the Web, where you can look over 
your Apple account information, including credit card details. 
• Sign Out. Tap when, for example, a friend wants to use her own 
iTunes account to buy something on your iPad. As a gift, maybe.
• iForgot. If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID password, tap here. You’ll 
be offered a couple of different ways of establishing your identity—
and you’ll be given the chance to make up a new password.
Show All
This option is handy if you own more than one Apple gadget. It means 
that, in your lists of Music and Videos, you’ll see the names of songs and 
movies you’ve bought using your other Apple phones, tablets, and com-

puters—even though they’re not on this iPad yet. Seeing them listed makes 
it easy to download them to your iPad, no extra charge.
In related news, the iTunes Match option gives your iPad access to your 
entire music collection online—if you’ve signed up for Apple’s iTunes Match 
service ($25 a year; see page 443). 
Automatic Downloads
If you have an iCloud account (and you probably should), then a very con-
venient option is available to you: automatic downloads of music, apps, 
and ebooks you’ve bought on other iOS gadgets. For example, if you 
buy a new album on your iPhone, turning on Music here means that your 
iPad will download the same album automatically next time it’s in a WiFi 
hotspot.
Updates means that if you accept an updated version of an app on one of 
your other Apple gadgets, it will be auto-updated on this iPad, too.
Those downloads are, however, big. On a cellular iPad, they can eat up 
your monthly data allotment right quick and send you deep into Surcharge 
Land. That’s why the cellular iPad does that automatic downloading only 
when you’re in a WiFi hotspot—unless you turn on Use Cellular Data. Hope 
you know what you’re doing.
Finally, the Suggested Apps section offers a duplicate set of on/off 
switches for the Suggested Apps feature described on page 474. 
Passbook and Apple Pay
Here’s everything the iPad needs to know in order to help you buy stuff 
online with your fingerprint (page 445): your credit or debit card details 
and your contact information. Appears on the iPad Air 2 and mini 3 only.
Mail, Contacts, Calendars
There’s a lotta stuff going on in one place here. Breathe deeply; take it 
slow.
Accounts
Your email accounts are listed here; this is also where you set up new ones. 
See page 379 for details.

Fetch New Data
More than ever, the iPad is a real-time window into the data stream of your 
life. Whatever changes are made to your calendar, address book, or email 
back on your computer at home (or at the office) can magically show up 
on your iPad, seconds later, even though you’re across the country.
That’s the beauty of “push” email, contacts, and calendars. You get push 
email if you have a free Yahoo Mail account. You get all three if you’ve 
signed up for an iCloud account (Chapter 15), or if your company uses 
Microsoft Exchange (Chapter 16).
Having an iPad that’s updated with these critical life details in real time 
is amazingly useful, but there are several reasons why you might want 
to turn off the Push feature. You’ll save battery power, save money when 
you’re traveling abroad (where every “roaming” Internet use can run up 
your cellular bill), and avoid the constant “new mail” jingle when you’re try-
ing to concentrate (or sleep).
And what if you don’t have a push email service, or if you turn it off? In 
that case, your iPad can still do a pretty decent job of keeping you up to 
date. It can check your email every 15 minutes, every half-hour, every hour, 
or only on command (Manually). That’s the decision you make in the Fetch 
New Data panel here. (Keep in mind that more frequent checking means 
shorter battery life.)
Tip: The iPad always checks email each time you open the Mail app, 
regardless of your setting here. If you have a push service like iCloud 
or Exchange, it also checks for changes to your schedule or address 
book each time you open Calendar or Contacts—again, no matter 
what your setting here.
Mail
Here you set up your email account information, specify how often you 
want the iPad to check for new messages, how you want your Mail app to 
look, and more.
• Preview. It’s cool that the iPad shows you the first few lines of text 
in every message. Here you can specify how many lines. More lines 
mean you can skim your inbound messages without having to open 
many of them; fewer lines mean more messages fit without scrolling.
• Show To/Cc Label. If you turn this option on, then a tiny, light-gray 
logo appears next to many of the messages in your inbox. The j 
logo indicates that this message was addressed directly to you; the 
k logo means you were merely “copied” on a message primarily 
intended for someone else.

Settings
487
If there’s no logo at all, then the message is in some other category. 
Maybe it came from a mailing list, or it’s an email blast (a Bcc), or the 
message is from you, or it’s a bounced message. 
• Swipe Options. Which colorful insta-tap buttons would you like to 
appear when you swipe across a message in a list? See page 391 
for details.
• Flag Style. You can flag messages to draw your own attention to 
them, either with the old-style flag icon—or, for visual spark, an 
orange dot. Here’s where you choose. 
• Ask Before Deleting. Ordinarily, you can delete an open message 
quickly and easily, just by tapping the T icon. But if you’d prefer to 
encounter an additional confirmation step before the message disap-
pears, then turn this option on. 
Note: The confirmation box appears only when you’re deleting an open 
message—not when you delete one from the list of messages.
• Load Remote Images. Spammers, the vile undercrust of lowlife soci-
ety, have a trick. When they send you email that includes a picture, 
they don’t actually paste the picture into the message. Instead, they 
include a “bug”—a piece of code that instructs your email program to 
fetch the missing graphic from the Internet. Why? Because that gives 
the spammer the ability to track who has actually opened the junk 
mail, making those email addresses much more valuable for reselling 
to other spammers.

Chapter 17
488
If you turn this option off, then the iPad does not fetch “bug” image 
files at all. You’re not flagged as a sucker by the spammers. You’ll see 
empty squares in the email where the images ought to be. (Graphics 
sent by normal people and legitimate companies are generally pasted 
right into the email, so they’ll still show up just fine.)
• Organize By Thread. This is the on/off switch for the feature that 
clumps related back-and-forths into individual items in your Mail 
inbox.
• Always Bcc Myself. If this option is on, then you’ll get a secret copy 
of any message you send. That’s handy if you want your computer to 
have a record of replies you sent from your iPad.
• Mark Addresses. The iPad can make an email address appear in red 
type if it’s somebody outside your company (page 460). That’s to 
help you avoid making costly security errors. 
• Increase Quote Level. Each time you reply to a reply, it gets indented 
more, so you and your correspondents can easily distinguish one 
reply from the next.
• Signature. A signature is a bit of text that gets stamped at the bot-
tom of your outgoing email messages. Here’s where you can change 
yours.
• Default Account. Your iPad can manage an unlimited number of 
email accounts. Here you can tap the account you want to be your 
default—the one that’s used when you create a new message from 
another program, like a Safari link, or when you’re on the All Inboxes 
screen of Mail.
Contacts
Contacts is a first-class citizen with an icon of its own on the Home screen, 
so it gets its own little set of options in Settings:
• Sort Order, Display Order. How do you want the names in your 
Contacts list sorted—by first name or by last name?
Note that you can have them sorted one way but displayed another 
way. Not all the combinations make sense.
• Show in App Switcher. The app switcher now displays icons for the 
people you contact most (or contacted most recently). You can turn 
that feature off here.

Settings
489
• Short Name. When this switch is on, the Mail app may fit more email 
addressees’ names into its narrow To box by shortening them. It may 
display “M. Mouse,” for example, or “Mickey,” or even “M.M.”—whatever 
you select here.
Prefer Nicknames is similar. It instructs Mail to display the nicknames 
for your friends (as determined in Contacts) instead of their real 
names.
• My Info. Tap here to tell the iPad which card in Contacts represents 
you. Knowing who you are is useful to the iPad in a number of 
places—for example, it’s how Siri knows what you mean when you say, 
“Give me directions home.”
• Default Account. Here again, the iPad can manage multiple address 
books—from iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo, and so on. Tap the account you 
want new contacts to fall into, if you haven’t specified one in advance. 
(This item doesn’t appear unless you have multiple accounts.)
Calendars
Your iPad’s calendar can be updated by remote control, wirelessly, through 
the air, either by your company (via Exchange, Chapter 16) or by some-
body at home using your computer (via iCloud, Chapter 15).
• Time Zone Override. Whenever you arrive in a new city, the iPad, if it 
can get online, learns what time zone it’s in and changes its own clock 
automatically.
So here’s a mind-teaser. Suppose there’s a big meeting in California at 
2 p.m. tomorrow—but you’re in New York right now. How should that 
event appear on your calendar? Should it appear as 2 p.m. (that is, its 
local time)? Or should it appear as 5 (your East Coast time)? 
It’s not an idle question, because it also affects reminders and alarms.
Out of the box, Time Zone Override is turned off. The iPad slides 
appointments around on your calendar as you travel to different time 
zones. If you’re in California, that 2 p.m. meeting appears at 2 p.m. 
When you return to New York, it says 5 p.m. Handy—but dangerous if 
you forget what you’ve done.
If you turn on the Override, though, the iPad leaves all your appoint-
ments at the hours you record them—in the time zone you specify 
with the pop-up menu here. This option is great if you like to record 
events at the times you’ll be experiencing them; they’ll never slosh 
around as you travel. If you, a New Yorker, will travel to San Francisco 
next week for a 2 p.m. meeting, write it down as 2 p.m.; it will still say 
2 p.m. when you land there.

• Alternate Calendars. If you prefer to use the Chinese, Hebrew, or 
Islamic calendar systems, go nuts here.
• Week numbers. This option makes Calendar display a little gray 
notation that identifies which week you’re in (out of the 52 this year). 
It might say, for example, “W42.” Because, you know, some people 
aren’t aware enough of time racing by.
• Show Invitee Declines. You can invite someone to a meeting, as 
described on page 292. If they click Decline (they can’t make it), 
maybe you don’t need your iPad to alert you. In that case, turn this 
switch off.
• Sync. If you’re like most people, you refer to your calendar more often 
to see what events are coming up than to see the ones you’ve already 
lived through. Ordinarily, therefore, the iPad saves you some syncing 
time and storage space by updating only relatively recent events on 
your iPad calendar. It doesn’t bother with events that are older than 
2 weeks, or 6 months, or whatever you choose here. (Or you can turn 
on All Events if you want your entire life, past and future, synced each 
time—storage and wait time be damned.)
• Default Alert Times. If you like to set reminder alarms for calendar 
appointments, then these options can save you some steps. Here you 
can set it up so that every new appointment has the reminder alarm 
turned on—and set how much in advance it rings. For Birthdays and 
All-Day Events, you can request an alarm at 9 a.m. on the day of the 
event, a day or two before, or a week ahead. For regular Events, your 
choices range from 1 week before to 5 minutes before—or even At 
time of event.
• Start Week On. This option specifies which day of the week appears 
at the left edge of the screen in the calendar’s Day and Month views. 
For most people, that’s Sunday, or maybe Monday—but for all iOS 
cares, your week could start on a Thursday.
• Default Calendar. This option lets you answer the question: “When I 
add a new appointment to my calendar on the iPad, which calendar 
(category) should it belong to?” You can choose Home, Work, Kids, or 
whatever category you use most often.
Notes
Notes can sync with various online services: iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo, and so 
on. Tap Default Account here to specify which one should receive new 
notes you create if you haven’t specifically chosen one.

Settings
491
Reminders
Here are the preference settings for the Reminders app:
• Sync. How far back do you want Reminders to go when it syncs its 
to-do lists with your computer, iCloud, and various other calendar 
programs?
• Default List. Suppose you’ve created multiple Reminder lists 
(Groceries, Movies to Rent, To Do, and so on). When you create a new 
item—for example, by telling Siri, “Remind me to fix the sink”—which 
list should it go on? Here’s where you specify. 
Messages
These options govern text messages (SMS) and iMessages, both of which 
are described in Chapter 5:
• iMessage. This is the on/off switch for iMessages. If it’s off, then your 
iPad never sends or receives these handy, free messages—only regular 
text messages.  
• Send Read Receipts. If this is on, then people who send you iMes-
sages will know when you’ve seen them. They’ll see a tiny gray text 
notification beneath the iMessage bubble that contains their mes-
sage. If you’re creeped out by people being able to know when you’re 
ignoring them, then turn this item off. 
• Send & Receive. Here you can enter additional email addresses that 
people can use to send your iPad iMessages. 
This screen also offers a Start new conversations from item that lets 
you indicate what you want to appear on the other guy’s iPad when 
you send a text: your cellphone number or email address.
• Show Subject Field. If email messages can have subject lines, why not 
text messages? Now they can; the message arrives with a little divid-
ing line between the subject and the body, offering your recipient a 
hint as to what it’s about.
• Blocked. Here’s a way to build up a list of people you don’t want to 
hear from.
• Keep Messages. In iOS 8, you can now specify how long you want 
Messages to retain a record of your exchanges: 30 days, a year, or 
forever.

Chapter 17
492
• Audio Messages. You can now shoot audio utterances to other 
people just as easily as you can type them. Here you can set them to 
auto-delete after 2 minutes. Why? First, because audio files take up 
space on your iPad. Second, because you may consider them spoken 
text messages—not recordings to preserve for future generations.
• Video Messages. Same deal here. You can set up video clips you send 
in Messages to auto-delete after a couple of minutes for the same 
reasons.
FaceTime
These options pertain to FaceTime, the video calling feature described in 
Chapter 4. Here, for example, is the on/off switch for the entire feature; 
the on/off switch for making FaceTime calls over a cellular connection, via 
an iPhone (which would eat up your monthly data plan); a place to enter 
your Apple ID, so people can make FaceTime calls to you; and a place to 
enter email addresses and a phone number, which can also be used to 
reach you.
The Caller ID section lets you specify how you want to be identified when 
you place a call to somebody else: either as a phone number or an email 
address.
Finally, here yet again is the Blocked option—another way to edit the list of 
people you don’t want to hear from (page 491).
Maps
The Maps app has a few settings of its own:
• Navigation Voice Volume. As Siri gives you spoken navigational 
instructions, how loud do you want her to be? Or would you like her 
to shut up entirely?
• Distances. Measured in miles or kilometers, sir/madam?
• Map Labels. Would you like place names to appear in English—or in 
their native spellings?
Safari
Here’s everything you ever wanted to adjust in the Web browser but didn’t 
know how to ask.

Settings
493
Search
• Search Engine. Your choice here determines who does your searching 
from the search bar: Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo (a limited 
search service famous for its refusal to collect your data or track your 
searches).
• Search Engine Suggestions. As you type into Safari’s search box, it 
tries to save you time in two ways. First, it sprouts a list of common 
search requests, based on what millions of other people have sought. 
This list changes with each letter you type. Second, Safari may auto-
complete the address based on what you’ve typed so far, using 
suggestions from your History and bookmarks list. This switch shuts 
off those suggestions. (It’s here primarily for the benefit of privacy 
hounds, who object to the fact that their search queries are processed 
by Apple in order to show the suggestions.)
• Spotlight Suggestions. In iOS 8, Spotlight searches (Chapter 2) can 
now find matches from the iTunes, iBooks, and App stores; from 
databases of local businesses, restaurants, and theaters; and from the 
Web. Unless you turn this off.
• Quick Website Search. You can search within a site (like Amazon 
or Reddit or Wikipedia) using only Safari’s regular search bar, as 
described on page 361. If, that is, this switch is on.
• Preload Top Hit. As you type into the search box, Safari lists Web 
sites that match. The first one is the Top Hit—and if this switch is on, 
then Safari secretly downloads that page while you’re still finish-
ing your search. That way, if the Top Hit is the page you wanted, it 
appears almost instantly when you tap.
But here’s the thing: Safari downloads the Top Hit with every search—
which uses up data. Which could cost you money if you’re using a 
cellular iPad.
General
• Passwords & AutoFill. Safari’s AutoFill feature saves you tedious typ-
ing by filling in your passwords, name, address, and phone numbers 
on Web forms automatically (just for the sites you want). It can even 
store your credit card information, which makes buying things online 
much easier and quicker.
This screen lists the different kinds of data that Safari can auto-fill for 
you: Your contact info. Web site account names and passwords. (Tap 
Saved Passwords to see the complete list of the passwords it’s mem-

orized; tap Edit to delete certain ones.) Your credit cards. (Again, tap 
Saved Credit Cards to see or delete the memorized cards.)
• Favorites. As described on page 361, your Favorites in Safari are 
just ordinary bookmarks in an extraordinary folder. Here you can 
choose a different folder as the home of your Favorites. 
• Open New Tabs in Background. When you tap a link with your finger, 
should the new page open in front of the current page—or behind it? 
Answer here.
• Show Favorites Bar. Turn on this switch if you’d like Safari to display 
a button bar of your bookmarks, just below the address bar. Eats up 
screen space but saves you some digging every time you want to visit 
one of your favorites.
• Show Tab Bar. Do you want to see a little strip of filing-folder tabs, 
representing all your open windows (as you would on a computer)?
• Block Pop-ups. In general, you want this turned on. You really don’t 
want pop-up ad windows ruining your surfing session. Now and again, 
though, pop-up windows are actually useful. When you’re buying con-
cert tickets, for example, a pop-up window might show the location 
of the seats. In that situation, you can turn this option off.
Privacy & Security
• Do Not Track. If you turn this on, then Web sites agree not to secretly 
track your activity on the Web. The problem is, of course, that this 
program is voluntary—and the sleazy operators just ignore it.

Settings
495
• Block Cookies. You can learn all about cookies—and these options to 
tame them—on page 376. 
• Fraudulent Website Warning. This option makes Safari warn you 
when you try to visit what it knows to be a phishing site. (Phishing is a 
common Internet scam. The bad guy builds a fake version of Amazon, 
PayPal, or a bank’s Web site—and tries to trick you into “logging in.” 
You therefore unwittingly give up your name and password.)
• Clear History and Website data. Like any Web browser, Safari keeps 
a list of Web sites you’ve visited recently to make it easier for you to 
revisit them: the History list. And like any browser, Safari therefore 
exposes your activities to any suspicious spouse or crackpot col-
league. If you’re nervous about that prospect, then tap Clear History 
and Website data to erase your tracks. This feature deletes all the 
cookies that Web sites have deposited on your “hard drive.”
• Use Cellular Data. The Reading List feature (page 364) is wonder-
ful. But because it requires downloading entire Web pages to your 
iPad—and then syncs them to all your other Apple gadgets—it uses 
a lot of data. If you have a cellular iPad, and you fear going over your 
cellphone plan’s monthly data allotment, then turn this off. You’ll 
be allowed to save sites to your Reading List only when in a WiFi 
hotspot.
• Advanced. Safari recognizes HTML5, a Web technology that lets 
Web sites store data on your iPad, for accessing even when you’re 
not online (like your Gmail stash). In Website Data, you can see which 
Web apps have created these databases on your iPad and delete 
them if necessary.
JavaScript is a programming language whose bits of code frequently 
liven up Web pages. If you suspect some bit of code is choking Safari, 
however, you can turn off its ability to decode JavaScript here.
The Web Inspector is for Web-site programmers. You connect your 
iPad to a Mac with a USB cable; then, in Safari on the computer, you 
choose DebugÆiPadÆ[the name of the Web site currently on the 
iPad’s screen]. You’ll be able to examine errors, warnings, tips, and 
logs for HTML, Java­Script, and CSS—great when you’re designing and 
debugging Web pages or Web apps for the iPad.
Music
On this panel, you can adjust a bunch of iPod playback features. Most of 
them—Sound Check, EQ, Volume Limit, and Group By Album Artist—are 
described starting on page 190. 

Chapter 17
496
Then comes Show All Music. It makes the Music app list all the music 
you’ve acquired from Apple, even the songs you haven’t actually down-
loaded to your iPad.
Genius, iTunes Match, and Home Sharing are described in Chapter 7.
Videos
Here’s what you can adjust for the Videos app:
• Start Playing. When you play a video you’ve seen before, you can 
have it begin either from Where Left Off or From Beginning. 
• Show All Videos. Do you want the Videos app to show all the TV 
shows and movies you’ve ever bought from Apple—even the ones 
you haven’t actually stored on the iPad?
• Home Sharing. You can also access your iTunes video collection, as 
described on page 195. 
Photos & Camera
Here’s a motley collection of photo-related settings:
• iCloud Photo Library, My Photo Stream, iCloud Photo Sharing, 
Upload Burst Photos. These options are described on page 436.
• Summarize Photos. In the Photos app, the Years and Collections 
screens generally display one tiny thumbnail for every single photo. 
This feature is designed to make those displays more manageable by 
displaying fewer, but representative, thumbnails. (You won’t see any 
difference unless you have a pretty huge collection of photos.) 
• Play Each Slide For. How long do you want each photo to remain 
on the screen? You can choose 2, 3, 5, 10, or 20 seconds. (Hint: 2 is 
plenty, 3 at most. Anything more than that will bore your audience 
silly.)
• Repeat, Shuffle. These options work just as they do for music. Repeat 
makes the slideshow loop endlessly; Shuffle plays the slides in random 
order.
• Grid turns the “Rule of Thirds” grid on or off on the camera’s view-
finder screen (page 208).
• Keep Normal Photo. See the tip on page 209. 

Settings
497
iBooks
Why, it’s every setting imaginable that pertains to the iBooks ebook read-
ing app. They’re described on page 304.
Podcasts
These settings affect the Podcasts app described on page 332. They 
govern how often the app auto-downloads new episodes, and how many; 
whether it can do so using cellular data (instead of WiFi) on a cellular iPad; 
and whether you want the app to auto-delete podcasts you’ve already lis-
tened to.
Game Center
You can read about the Game Center on page 301. This page of prefer-
ences offers options like these:
Game Invites
More security stuff. Do you want your iPad to permit invitations from other 
people to play games? How about people in the same room or building, 
inviting you to play over WiFi or Bluetooth? Here are the on/off switches 
for Allow Invites and Nearby Players.
Game Center Profile
Here’s your Game Center player name. Tap it to edit your nickname, make 
your Game Center listing invisible to strangers (Public Profile), or associ-
ate a new email address with your account. 
Friend Recommendations
Playing games isn’t much fun without friends to play against, so Game 
Center is happy to suggest fellow Game Center participants from your 
Contacts list or your Facebook account. Unless you turn off these switches.
Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Vimeo
These pages let you enter your name and password just once, in this one 
place, for each of these popular Web services—so that the iPad, and other 
apps, can freely access those accounts without having to bother you.

Chapter 17
498
Each of these panels also offers an Install button, making it quick and easy 
to download the official Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and Vimeo apps.
The Twitter and Facebook options offer some additional choices:
• Twitter. Update Contacts adds your friends’ Twitter account names to 
their cards in Contacts, saving you that tedious data entry. 
• Facebook. Tapping Settings lets you tell the iPad how to alert you 
when new Facebook posts arrive: with a sound, for example. You can 
also limit Facebook video recordings to standard definition, to avoid 
massive data charges. 
The Allow These Apps items let you control which built-in apps can 
access your Facebook account; for example, turn off Calendar if you 
don’t want to see your friends’ Facebook birthdays on your calendar.
Finally, Update All Contacts is the powerful button that adds photos 
and Facebook account names to the corresponding friends’ cards in 
your Contacts app, as described on page 128.
App Preferences
At the bottom of the Settings app screen, you see a list of apps that have 
installed setting screens of their own. For example, here’s where you can 
edit your screen name and password for the AIM chat program, change 
how many days’ worth of news you want the NY Times Reader to dis-
play, and so on. Each one offers an assortment of changeable preference 
options.
It can get to be a very long list.

ou gotta admit it: Opening up a new iPad brings a certain excite-
ment. There’s a prospect of possibility, of new beginnings. Even 
if you intend to protect your iPad with a case, there are those 
first few minutes when it’s shiny, spotless, free of fingerprints or nicks—a 
gorgeous thing.
This chapter is all about getting started, whether that means buying and 
setting up a new iPad, or upgrading an older model to the new iOS 8 soft-
ware that’s described in this book.
Buying a New iPad
Each year’s new iPad model is faster, has a better camera and screen, and 
comes packed with more features than the previous one. Still, “new iPad” 
doesn’t have to mean the iPad Air 2 ($500 and up) or mini 3 ($400 and 
up). You can buy an earlier model for much less, like an iPad Air ($400 and 
up) or mini 2 ($300 and up).
If you decide to get a cellular iPad, you’ll pay $130 extra, but you’ll be able 
to get online almost anywhere you go. In that case, you have to choose a 
cell carrier (Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, or T-Mobile). See page 349 for some 
guidance.
Setting Up a New iPad
In the olden days, you couldn’t use a new iPad at all without hooking it up 
to a computer. Now, though, the setup process takes place entirely on the 
tablet’s screen.
You don’t need a computer to back up your iPad, because iCloud backs 
it up. You don’t need a computer to store your music and video collec-
tions, because the App Store remembers what you’ve bought and lets

you re-download it at any time. You don’t need a computer to download 
and install app updates, because they come straight to the iPad now. You 
don’t even need a computer to edit photos or to create mail folders; that’s 
on the iPad, too.
The first time you turn on a brand-new iPad—or an older one that you’ve 
erased completely—the setup wizard appears. Swipe your finger where it 
says slide to set up. Now you’re asked about 16 important questions:
• Language; Country. You won’t get very far setting up your iPad if you 
can’t understand the instructions. So the very first step here is to tell 
it what language you speak. When you tap a language, you’re next 
asked to tell the iPad where in the world you live. (It proposes the 
country where you bought the iPad. Clever, eh?)
• Wi-Fi Networks. Tap the name of the WiFi network you want, enter 
the password if required, and tap Join.
Or, if there’s no WiFi you can (or want to) hop onto right now, and 
you have a cellular iPad, tap Choose Cellular Connection.

• Location Services. The iPad knows where you are. That’s how it can 
pinpoint you on a map, tag the photos you take with their geographic 
locations, find you a nearby Mexican restaurant, and so on. 
Some people are creeped out by the iPad’s knowing where they are, 
worrying that Apple, by extension, also knows where they are. So 
here’s your chance to turn off all the iPad’s location features. Tap ei-
ther Enable Location Services or Disable Location Services.
• Set Up Your iPad. If you’ve owned an iPad before, or if you backed up 
this iPad and then erased it, you don’t have to load it up with all your 
apps and settings by hand. This screen offers to reload all your stuff 
from your most recent backup. (See Chapter 14 for details on iPad 
backups.)
Tap Restore from iCloud Backup (if your backup was on iCloud) or 
Restore from iTunes Backup (if your backup was on your computer).
And if you’ve never owned an iPad before, you can choose Set Up as 
New iPad to start fresh.
• Apple ID. A million features require an Apple ID—just about any trans-
action you make with Apple online. Buying anything from Apple, from 
a song to a laptop. Using iCloud (Chapter 15). Playing games against 
other people online. Making an appointment at an Apple Store.
If you already have an Apple ID, tap Sign In with Your Apple ID and 
enter it here. If not, tap Create a Free Apple ID. You’ll be asked to 
provide your name, birthday, email address (or you can create a new 
iCloud email address), a password of your choice, and answers to a 
few security questions (you’ll have to get them right if you ever forget 
your password). You also get to decide if you’d like the honor of re-
ceiving junk email from Apple. 
On the screen full of legalese, tap Agree, and then Agree.
(You can tap Skip This Step if you don’t want an Apple ID, at least for 
now. You can get one later in Settings.)
• Use iCloud. You get this screen, and the next two, only if you did sign 
in with your Apple ID. 
Since you’ve had a glance at Chapter 15, you already know how useful 
Apple’s free iCloud service can be. Here’s where you indicate whether 
or not you want to use iCloud at all.

Appendix A
504
• Find My iPad. If you did opt into iCloud, you’re also asked if you’d like 
to Use Find My iPad. If you do, you’ll be able to locate your lost iPad 
on a map, using any Web browser. You’ll also be able to command it 
to start pinging loudly, so you can find where you left it in the house. 
It’s a pretty great feature. 
If you turn Find My iPad on, you’re also asked to make up a four-digit 
password so that the bad guys can’t get around you just by turning 
Find My iPad off.
• iCloud Drive. Here’s the new iOS 8 feature described on page 283. 
It’s a “folder in the sky,” whose files you can access from any Apple 
gadget at any time. By all means use choose Upgrade to iCloud 
Drive—unless you have non–iOS 8 devices, or pre–OS X Yosemite 
Macs, in which case you have a decision to make. Those older devices 
won’t be able to access the iCloud Drive.
• Touch ID. If you have an iPad Air 2 or mini 3, you’re now invited to 
teach it your fingerprint, for the purposes of unlocking it without 
having to type a password. See 50 for more on registering fin-
gerprints. (You can also tap Set Up Touch ID Later. When the time 
comes, you can revisit this process in SettingsÆTouch ID & Passcode.)
• Passcode. Whether you opted to store a fingerprint or not, you’re 
now asked to make up a four-digit passcode (password) for unlock-
ing your iPad. You’ll need it whenever the iPad won’t accept Touch 
ID—for example, after you’ve restarted the iPad. Passcode-protecting 
your iPad is a good idea but not required. If you don’t worry about 
its falling into bad guys’ hands, or you don’t want to have to enter 
a password every time you wake the iPad, you can tap Don’t Add 
Passcode.
• iCloud Keychain is a terrific feature. It stores all your Web user names 
and passwords—and even credit card numbers—so you don’t have to 
memorize them and type them in over and over. It’s all synchronized 
across all your Apple machines (iPad, iPhone, Mac, and so on).
If you take this opportunity to set it up, you’re asked what you want 
to use as your iCloud Security Code. That’s yet another four-digit 
passcode, which you may need someday to recover all your pass-
words if you have a really lousy day and lose all your Apple gadgets. 
Fortunately, you can use your iPad passcode (the one you’ve already 
set up) as your iCloud Security Code, so you don’t have another code 
to remember. 
On the next screen, you’re supposed to enter a phone number—of 
“someone you trust”—which Apple will use as a secondary way to 
verify your identity if you have to recover your iCloud Keychain with-
out having any of your Apple gadgets available.

• Use Siri. Here’s your chance to turn off Siri, the greatest feature in 15 
years. So why would you ever want to turn it off? Because it works by 
sending your voice utterances to Apple’s computers for processing, 
and that thought alarms the privacy-obsessed.
• Diagnostics. Behind the scenes, your iPad sends records back to 
Apple, including your location and what you’re doing on your iPad. 
By analyzing this data en masse, Apple can figure out where the 
dead spots in the cellular network are, how to fix bugs, and so on. 
The information is anonymous—it’s not associated with you. But if the 
very idea seems invasive, here’s your chance to prevent this data from 
being sent.
• App Analytics. A related question: Is it OK for Apple to send statistics 
about how you use your apps to the makers of those apps?
• Welcome to iPad. Your iPad is set up. Tap Get Started to jump to the 
Home screen.
Upgrading an iPad to iOS 8
If you bought an iPad Air 2 or mini 3, great! iOS 8 comes on it preinstalled.
But you can also upgrade many earlier iPad models to this new software: 
the iPad Air, iPad 3, iPad 3rd Generation, iPad 4th Generation, iPad mini 2, 
and original iPad mini.
You can upgrade in any of three ways:
• Upgrade it wirelessly. Upgrading means installing iOS 8 on top of 
whatever is already on your iPad. You don’t lose any data or settings.
This is the easiest way to upgrade. You’ve probably already seen the 
little red number on your Settings app icon, and on the word “Gener-
al” inside it; the iPad is trying to tell you that iOS 8 is ready to down-
load. Tap SettingsÆGeneralÆSoftware Update to see the iOS 8 logo; 
tap Download and Install. (You have to be on a WiFi network, and it’s 
wise to have your iPad plugged into power.)
• Upgrade it from iTunes. If you wish, you can also perform the 
upgrade using the iTunes program on your computer. This method 
takes less time, but, of course, it requires being at your computer.
To begin, connect your iPad and click its icon at top left (see Chap-
ter 14). On the Summary tab, click Check for Update, and then click 
Download and Update. 

Appendix A
506
• Restore it. This is a more dramatic step, which you should choose 
only if you’ve been having problems with your iPad or if, for some 
other reason, you would like to start completely fresh. This step backs 
up the iPad, erases it completely, installs iOS 8, and then copies your 
stuff back onto the iPad.
Connect the iPad to your computer, open iTunes, and then click Re-
store iPad.
The updating or restoring process takes awhile. You’ll see the iPad restart. 
When it’s all over, the PC-free setup process described on the previous 
pages begins automatically.
Note: Not all features work on all iPad models. For example, even with 
iOS 8, the iPad 3rd Generation, iPad 2, and original iPad mini don’t 
get the Continuity features described on page 452.
Older iPads may also be very slow with iOS 8—you’ve been 
warned—and there’s no way to go back to iOS 7.
If you find your iPad crawling, especially when you type, consider 
turning off Background App Refresh in SettingsÆ​General. And 
leave some space free; a full iPad is a slow iPad.
If your iPad is still crawling along like an anesthetized slug, there’s 
always the nuclear option: Erase it completely and load it up 
again. Many people report happier tidings after that extreme 
procedure.
Software Updates
As you’re probably aware, software like the iPad’s is a perpetual work in 
progress. Apple constantly fixes bugs, adds features, and makes tweaks to 
extend battery life and improve other services.
Updating Directly on the iPad
One day you’ll be minding your own business, and you’ll see a red num-
bered badge appear on the Settings app’s icon. Open SettingsÆ​GeneralÆ​
Software Update to read about the new update and install it. Note, though, 
that unless it’s plugged into a power source, your iPad won’t install an iOS 
update unless its battery is at least half full.
Install Updates from Your Computer
Maybe you’re not that adventurous and you’d prefer to install your soft-
ware update the old-fashioned way. No problem: Connect the iPad to 
iTunes, wirelessly or not (Chapter 14). Then click the iPad’s icon in iTunes; 
on the Summary pane, tap Check for Update.

Restrictions and Parental Controls
If you’re issuing an iPad to a child, or someone who acts like one, you’ll 
be gratified to discover that iOS offers a good deal of protection. That’s 
protection of your offspring’s delicate sensibilities (it can block pornogra-
phy and profanity) and protection of your bank account (it can block pur-
chases of music, movies, and apps without your permission).
To set this up, visit SettingsÆGeneralÆRestrictions. When you tap Enable 
Restrictions, you’re asked to make up a four-digit password (not necessar-
ily the same as the regular iPad passcode) that permits only you, the all-
knowing parent, to make changes to these settings. (Or you, the corporate 
IT administrator who’s doling out iPads to the white-collar drones.)
Once you’ve changed the settings described below, the only way to 
change them again (when your kid turns 18, for example) is to return to the 
Restrictions page and correctly enter the password. That’s also the only 
way to turn off the entire Restrictions feature (tap Disable Restrictions 
and correctly enter the password). To turn it back on, you have to make up 
a password all over again.
Once Restrictions is turned on, you can put up data blockades in a number 
of different categories. 

Appendix A
508
Allow
For starters, you can turn off access to iPad features that locked-down 
corporations might not want their employees—or parents might not want 
their children—to use, because they’re considered either security holes, 
time drains, or places to spend your money: Safari (can’t use the Web at 
all), the Camera, FaceTime, Siri & Dictation, and AirDrop.
A second list of options lets you block access to iTunes Store and the 
iBook Store, and turn off the option to download Podcasts. You can stop 
your kid from Installing Apps or Deleting Apps, too. And In-App Purchases 
permits you to buy new material (game levels, book chapters, and so on) 
from within an app that you‘ve already bought. In other words, even if 
you’ve shut down access to your offspring’s ability to install new apps, as 
described above, this loophole remains.
Many of these restrictions work by removing icons altogether from the 
iPad’s Home screen: Safari, iTunes, and Camera, for example. When the 
switch says Off, the corresponding icon has been taken off the Home 
screen and can’t be found even by Spotlight searches.
Allowed Content
Here you can spare your children’s sensitive eyes and ears by blocking 
inappropriate material. 
Ratings are a big deal; they determine the effectiveness of the parental 
controls described below. Since every country has its own rating schemes 
(for movies, TV shows, games, song lyrics, and so on), you use the Ratings 
For control to tell the iPad which country’s rating system you want to use.
Once that‘s done, you can use the Music & Podcasts, Movies, TV Shows, 
Books, and Apps controls to specify what your kid is allowed to watch, 
play, and listen to. For example, you can tap Movies and then tap PG-13; 
any movies rated “higher,” like R or NC-17, won’t play on the iPad now. (And 
if your sneaky offspring try to buy these naughty songs, movies, or TV 
shows wirelessly from the iTunes Store, they’ll discover that the Buy button 
is dimmed and unavailable.)
For some categories, like Music & Podcasts and Siri, you can turn off 
Explicit to prevent the iPad from playing iTunes Store songs that contain 
naughty language, or speaking them.
Websites lets you shield impressionable young eyes from pornography 
online. It offers four settings:
• 	All Websites. No protection at all.
• 	Limit Adult Content. Apple will apply its own judgment in blocking 
dirty Web sites, using a blocked-site list that it has compiled. 

Signup & Setup
509
That doesn’t mean you can’t override Apple’s wisdom, however. The 
Always Allow and Never Allow controls let you add the addresses of 
Web sites that you think should be OK (or should not be OK).
• 	Specific Websites Only. This is a “whitelist” feature. It means that the 
entire Web is blocked except for the few sites listed here: safe bets 
like Disney, PBS Kids, Smithsonian Institution, and so on. You can add 
your own sites to this list, but the point is clear: This is the Web with 
training wheels.
• Require Password. Ordinarily, once you’ve entered your Apple 
account password to download something from Apple’s online stores, 
the iPad doesn’t ask you for the password again for 15 minutes. 
During that time, you can buy more stuff without any further security 
blockades.
That’s great for you—but a huge opportunity for naughty youngsters, 
who might be tempted to go nuts buying stuff within that window. 
This option lets you require a password for every purchase, even ones 
you make 2 minutes apart (turn on Immediately).
Privacy
These switches can prohibit the unauthorized user from making changes 
to the iPad’s privacy settings, which are described on page 481.
Allow Changes 
These items (Accounts, Cellular Data Use, Background App Refresh, 
Volume Limit) are safeguards against your offspring fiddling with limits 
you’ve set. 
Game Center 
These controls let you stop your kid from playing multiplayer games 
(against strangers online) or adding game-playing friends to the center.
Cases and Accessories
The iPad has inspired a torrent of accessories. Stylish cases, speakers, 
docks, cables, keyboards, cases with keyboards—the list goes on.
Just be sure you’re buying something that fits your iPad. For example, the 
Lightning connector (where the charging cable connects) on the iPad Air 
and later doesn’t fit any of the charging accessories that came before it—
at least not without the help of Apple’s $30 adapter (or the $40 adapter 
that has an 8-inch cable “tail”). 

Appendix A
510
Slowly, accessory companies are introducing Lightning-compatible gear. 
But for now, buyer beware—or buyer stock up on $30 adapters.
So what might you add to your iPad?
• Cases. It’s the iPad Paradox: People buy the thinnest, sleekest tab-
let in existence—and then bury it in a bulky carrying case. There’s 
just something so wrong about that. On the other hand, the iPad is 
made of glass; the instinct to protect it is understandable. Hundreds 
of different iPad cases are available; most double as stands, which is 
supremely useful. Some have a Bluetooth keyboard built in, so your 
iPad can become a handy little laptop.
Apple, of course, would love to interest you in its own iPad Smart 
Cover. Its hinge snaps magnetically onto the iPad’s edge; the cover 
protects the screen; and the iPad wakes up and sleeps when you 
open and close the cover. Oh, and the scored panels of the cover fold 
up in creative ways to prop up the iPad when you’re using it.
• Everything else. Speaker docks. Bluetooth speakers. Headphones 
and earbuds, wired and cordless. Credit card readers. Car cigarette-
lighter adapters. Alarm clocks. Video-out cables. Stylish sty-
luses. Touchscreen-compatible gloves. Tripods. Panorama stands. 
Kickstands. Car mounts. Activity monitors. Lenses. You Google it, 
you’ll find it. The iPad is, without a doubt, the most accessorized tab-
let in the world.

he iPad is a computer, and you know what that means: Things 
can go wrong. This particular computer, though, is not quite like 
a Mac or a PC. It runs a spin-off of the OS X operating system, but 
that doesn’t mean you can apply the same troubleshooting techniques. 
Therefore, let this appendix be your guide when things go wrong.
First Rule: Install the Updates
There’s an old saying: “Never buy version 1.0 of anything.” In the iPad’s 
case, the saying could be: “Never buy version 8.0 of anything.”
The very first version (or major revision) of anything has bugs, glitches, 
and things the programmers didn’t have time to finish the way they would 
have liked. The iPad is no exception. 
The beauty of the iPad, though, is that Apple can send it fixes, patches, 
and even new features through software updates. One day you’ll glance at 
your Home screen’s Settings icon, and—bam!—there’ll be a badge indicat-
ing that new iPad software is available.
So the first rule of trouble-free iPadding is to accept these updates when 
they’re offered. With each new software blob, Apple removes another few 
dozen tiny glitches. 
And sure enough: Within the first few weeks of iOS 8’s existence, software 
updates 8.0.1 and 8.0.2 came down the pike. Then 8.1 came, a month later, 
offering Apple Pay, Continuity, and other features. And more will come.

Seven Ways to Reset the iPad
The iPad runs actual programs, and as actual programs do, they actually 
crash. Sometimes, the program you’re working in simply vanishes and you 
find yourself back at the Home screen. Just reopen the program and get 
on with your life.
If the program you’re in just doesn’t seem to be working right—it’s fro-
zen or acting weird, for example—then one of these seven resetting tech-
niques usually clears things right up. 
Note: Proceed down this list in order! Start with the easy ones.
• Exit the app. On an iPad, you’re never aware that you’re launching 
and exiting programs. They’re always just there, like TV channels, 
when you switch to them. There’s no Quit command. But if a program 
starts acting glitchy, you can make it quit.
To do that, double-press the Home button to bring up the app 
switcher. Find the “card” that represents your balky app, and then flick 
it upward to quit it. Try reopening it to see if the problem has gone 
away. 
• Force quit the app. If the iPad is so frozen that you can’t even bring 
up the app switcher, you’ll have to force quit the stuck app. Hold 
down the Sleep switch until the slide to power off message appears. 
Then hold down the Home button for 10 seconds, or until the frozen 
program quits. The next time you open the troublesome program 
from the Home screen, it should be back in business. 
• Turn the iPad off and on again. If it seems something more serious 
has gone wrong, then hold down the Sleep switch for a few seconds. 
When the screen says slide to power off, confirm by swiping. The iPad 
shuts off completely. 
Turn it back on by pressing the Sleep switch for a second or two. 
• Force restart the iPad. If you haven’t been able to force quit the pro-
gram, and you can’t shut the iPad off either, you might have to force a 
restart. To do that, hold down the Home button and the Sleep switch 
for 10 seconds. Keep holding, even if the screen goes black or you 
see the “power off” slider. Don’t release until you see the Apple logo 
appear, meaning that the iPad is restarting. 
• Reset the iPad’s settings. Relax. This procedure doesn’t erase any of 
your data—only the iPad’s settings. In Settings, tap GeneralÆResetÆ​
Reset All Settings.

Troubleshooting & Maintenance
513
• Erase the whole iPad. From the Home screen, tap SettingsÆ​
GeneralÆ​ResetÆErase All Content and Settings. Now, this option 
zaps your stuff—all of it. Music, videos, email, settings, apps, all gone, 
and all overwritten with random 1’s and 0’s to make sure it’s com-
pletely unrecoverable. Clearly, you’re getting into last resorts here. 
Of course, you can then sync with your backup (iTunes or iCloud) to 
copy all that stuff back onto your iPad.
• Restore the iPad. If none of these steps seem to solve the iPad’s 
glitchiness, it might be time for the nuclear option: erasing it com-
pletely, resetting both hardware and software back to a factory-fresh 
condition.
Tip: If you’re able to sync the iPad with iCloud or iTunes first, do it! That 
way, you’ll have a backup of all those intangible iPad data bits: text 
messages, Recents list, and so on. iTunes will put it all back onto the 
iPad the first time you sync after the restore.
If you backed up to iTunes: Connect the iPad to your computer, as 
described in Chapter 14. In iTunes, click the iPad icon and then, on the 
Summary tab, click Restore. 
The first order of business: iTunes offers to make a backup of your 
iPad (all of its iPad settings, text messages, and so on) before pro-
ceeding. Accepting this invitation is an excellent idea. Click Back Up.
If you backed up to iCloud: You can restore your iPad this way only if 
your iPad is completely wiped empty. If it’s not, then manually erase it 
using iTunes first.
During the setup screens described on page 503, tap Restore from 
iCloud Backup. You’re shown the three most recent backups; tap the 
one you want. The iPad goes right to work downloading your settings

and account information. Then it restarts and begins to download 
your apps; if you’re in a hurry for one particular app, tap its icon to 
make iCloud prioritize it. At any time, you can check the restore pro-
cess’s status in SettingsÆ​iCloudÆStorage and Backup.
When that’s all over, you can get to work downloading your music (if 
you’re an iTunes Match subscriber).
iPad Doesn’t Turn On
Usually, the problem is that the battery’s dead. Just plugging it into the 
USB cord or USB charger doesn’t bring it to life immediately, either; a 
completely dead iPad doesn’t wake up until it’s been charging for about 
10 minutes. It pops on automatically when it has enough juice to do so.
If you don’t think that’s the trouble, try the force-restarting trick described 
on page 512. And if that doesn’t work, read on.
The Force Restore
If your iPad gets stuck starting up at the Apple logo, or it just stays black, 
then something more serious may have happened. Tablets, like the best of 
us, sometimes get confused.
The solution is the drastic, but effective, force restore process (known to 
techies as the Default Firmware Update mode).
Open iTunes on your computer. Connect the iPad with its white USB cable.
Now hold down the Sleep switch and Home button simultaneously for 10 
seconds—then release only the Sleep switch.
Keep the Home button pressed until iTunes tells you that an iPad in 
Recovery mode has been detected; click OK. (If you see anything but 
blackness on your iPad’s screen—an Apple logo, for example—then the 
process didn’t work. If the problem has not, in fact, gone away, then you 
should start again.)
Now iTunes tells you again that you’re in Recovery mode and offers only 
one button: Restore iPad. Click that, and then confirm by clicking Restore 
& Update. The process of reinstalling the latest, fresh copy of iOS  begins.
Once everything’s running fine, you can restore all your apps and settings 
from the latest backup as described at the end of Chapter 14.

Troubleshooting & Maintenance
515
Battery Life Is Terrible
If your battery seems to drain faster after you’ve installed iOS 8, maybe it’s 
because you’re using the iPad more, checking out the cool new features. 
If that’s not the problem, or if you’re getting a “Not charging” message, 
consult the battery-saving tips on page 31.
Out of Space
It happens all the time. You couldn’t imagine filling up 32, 64, or 128 giga-
bytes of storage, so you saved some money by buying an iPad with less. 
And now you can’t even take a video or a photo, because your iPad reports 
that it’s full. You’re frozen out until you have the time and expertise to 
delete some less important stuff.
The biggest space hogs on your iPad are video files, photo files, apps, and 
music files. Heck, deleting just one downloaded movie or TV show could 
solve your storage crunch instantly.
Fortunately, iOS makes it very easy to see what’s eating up your space—
and to delete the fattest ones to make the most room with the least effort. 
The key is to visit SettingsÆGeneralÆUsageÆManage Storage.

Appendix B
516
The list here shows what’s using up your space, biggest first; by tapping 
the ’ button, you can see the details and, in most cases, make some dele-
tions on the spot. 
Delete Photos and Recorded Videos
Unfortunately, this display shows how much space your Camera videos 
and photos take up, but it doesn’t let you delete them. To purge your pho-
tos, the quickest method is to hook up to iTunes, import the photos, and 
take advantage of the option to delete the freshly imported photos from 
the iPad (page 416).
Turning off your Photo Stream can give you back an instant gigabyte, too 
(page 246).
Delete “Other” Items
You know the colored graph of what’s on your iPad that shows up in iTunes 
(page 416)? Often, the biggest item here is the mysterious Other cat-
egory. What is that stuff? It’s caches (Internet data stored on the iPad to 
make repeated visits faster), backups, partial downloads, and data from 
iOS’s built-in apps—all your text messages and email, for example. Here’s 
how you clean them out:
• Delete the Web browser cache. The iPad saves Web pages into its 
own memory, so that they’ll appear faster the next time you try to 
visit them. If you’ve had your iPad awhile, those cache files can really 
add up. Open SettingsÆ​Safari; tap Clear History and Website Data. 
You may get a speed boost as a side effect.
• Delete text messages. In the Messages app, you can delete individual 
texts or entire conversations; because they frequently include photo, 
audio, or video files, you can reclaim a lot of space. 
• Delete email attachments. Files downloaded with your email take 
up a lot of space, too. The solution is to delete the email account 
(SettingsÆMail, Contacts, CalendarÆ[account name]; scroll down 
and tap Delete Account)—and then add it again.
In the process, you’ll vaporize all the attachment files and message 
caches that you’ve ever downloaded and opened on your iPad. When 
you add the account back again, those files will still be online, ready 
to download—but only when you need them. (This trick works for 
most account types—just not for POP3 accounts.)
• Delete voice memos, music files, and ebooks. Audio files and iBooks 
eat up a lot of space, too. Consider purging the recordings, books, 
and songs you can do without (from within the Voice Memos, iBooks, 
and Music apps). You can re-download them later from the App, 
iTunes, or iBooks stores—no charge—whenever you like.

Warranty and Repair
The iPad comes with a one-year warranty and 90 days of iPad tech sup-
port. If you buy an AppleCare+ contract ($100), you’re covered for a sec-
ond year.
If, during the coverage period, anything goes wrong that’s not your fault, 
Apple will fix it free. In fact, AppleCare+ covers damage even if it is your 
fault, for $50 each time—even if you drop the iPad or get it wet. Maximum: 
twice.
You can either take the iPad to an Apple Store, which is often the fastest 
route, or call 800-APL-CARE (800-275-2273) to arrange shipping back to 
Apple. In general, you’ll get the fixed iPad back in 3 business days. 
Note: Sync the iPad before it goes in for repair. The repair process 
generally erases the iPad completely—Apple very often simply 
hands you a new (or refurbished) iPad instead of your original. 
In fact, if you’re worried that someone at Apple might snoop 
around, you might want to back up and then erase the iPad first. 
(Use the Restore option—page 506.) 
Out-of-Warranty Repairs
Once the year or two has gone by, or if you damage your iPad in a way 
that’s not covered by the warranty (backing your car over it comes to 
mind), Apple charges $200 to $380 to repair an iPad, depending on the 
model. (Apple usually just replaces it.)
The Battery Replacement Program
Why did Apple seal the battery inside the iPad, anyway? Everyone knows 
lithium-ion batteries don’t last forever. After 300 or 400 charges, the iPad 
battery begins to hold less charge (perhaps 80 percent of the original). 
After a certain point, the iPad will need a new battery. How come you can’t 
change it yourself?
Apple’s reply: A user-replaceable battery takes up a lot more space inside 
the iPad. It requires a plastic compartment that shields the guts of the 
iPad from you and your fingers; it requires a removable door; and it needs 
springs or clips to hold the battery in place. 
In any case, you can’t change the battery yourself. If the iPad is out of war-
ranty, you must send it to Apple (or take it to an Apple Store) for a $100 
battery-replacement job. (As an eco-bonus, Apple properly disposes of 
the old batteries, which consumers might not do on their own.)

What to Do about a Cracked Screen
Keeping your iPad in a case may lower the chances of your dropping it 
or scratching it—but it can’t prevent bad luck. An good number of iPad 
screens meet an untimely end, even with cases on.
Apple will happily replace your iPad’s screen for $200 to $380, depend-
ing on the model. It’ll do it the same day if you take the iPad into an Apple 
Store, or you can mail it in and get a replacement in 3 to 5 days. (If you’ve 
bought the AppleCare+ extended-warranty service, a replacement is $50, 
as described above.)
There are plenty of other companies that can repair a cracked screen, 
though. The reps from iCracked.com, for example, send a technician to you 
and perform the fix on the spot. 
And then there’s the do-it-yourself technique. You can buy a 
screen-replacement kit for about $80 online, complete with the special 
tools you need to open the iPad and do the job yourself. It’s a job that 
requires care, patience, and some dexterity (Google can help you find the 
step-by-steps), but it’s a good option if you’re technically savvy.
Where to Go from Here
At this point, the iPad is such a phenomenon that there’s no shortage of 
resources for getting more help, news, and tips. Here are a few examples:
• Apple’s official iPad User Guide. Yes, there is an actual downloadable 
PDF user’s manual. http://support.apple.com/manuals/
• Apple’s official iPad help Web site. Online tips, tricks, and tutori-
als; troubleshooting topics; downloadable PDF help documents; and, 
above all, an enormous, seething treasure trove of discussion boards. 
http://www.apple.com/support/ipad/
• Apple’s service site. All the dates, prices, and expectations for getting 
your iPad repaired. Includes details on getting a temporary replace-
ment unit. https://www.apple.com/support/ipad/repair/
• iMore blog. News, tips, tricks, all in a blog format. www.imore.com/
• iLounge. Another great blog-format site. www.iLounge.com/
