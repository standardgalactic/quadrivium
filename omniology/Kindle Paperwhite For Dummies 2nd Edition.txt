Introduction
F

or many, the Kindle family of e-readers has “rekindled” their 
love of reading. Whether it’s the convenience of having an 
entire library stored on a 7.3-ounce device or the capability to 
enlarge the font so you can read more comfortably, Kindle users 
seem to be unanimous in their praise for this handy gadget. Even 
people uncertain about the idea of an e-reader tend to get hooked 
after they lay their eyes on the crisp, clear e-ink display — one that 
truly mimics a printed reading experience.
If you’re new to the Kindle world, welcome to the club. If you’re 
a seasoned pro who’s owned every generation of the device, I’m 
pleased to count you among the readership. And if you fall some­
where in between, well, I’m glad you’re here, too. My motto is, 
“Kindle enthusiasts, unite!” I’m here because of my love of reading, 
and I’ve discovered that Kindle e-readers, particularly the Kindle 
Paperwhite, make reading better. How? That’s what I share with 
you in this book.
About This Book
The Kindle Paperwhite is so easy to use, you might wonder why 
you need a book describing how to use it. Good question! Let’s 
just say that in five years of Kindle ownership — and buying 
every new e-ink Kindle the minute it hits the market — I still dis­
cover some new quirk or trick with every device. I share those 
hard-to-discover secrets in the book, saving you time and effort. 
In addition, reviewing the basics is always helpful, so I cover 
those in the book as well.
The chapters are designed so that they can stand alone — if you 
don’t feel like you need a primer on tapping and swiping, skip 
ahead to something that interests you more. Looking for free 
books? See Chapter 5. Have you heard that you can rent text­
books? That process is explained in Chapter 9. Is your battery 
not lasting as long as you expect? Discover troubleshooting hints 
in Chapter 11.

I used certain conventions to make it easy for readers to under­
stand the techniques that are presented, whether they’re shortcuts 
or keywords for searching the Kindle Store:
	
✓	Bold: Indicates an action you take on the touchscreen. The 
bold, numbered text in a numbered list indicates the action 
you take to accomplish a task. Similarly, if you need to type 
something using the on screen keyboard, those instructions 
will be printed in bold.
	
✓	Italics: Indicates a term I define. I also use italics to indicate a 
term you search for on the web. Italics are also used to indi­
cate placeholder text, such as yourname@free.kindle.com and 
yourname@kindle.com.
	
✓	Monofont:Indicates a URL (a web address). Note that 
URLs are links; just tap the URL with your finger to go 
to that web page — if you’re reading this on your Kindle 
Paperwhite, of course!
	
	In addition to URLs, chapter and section references are links; 
just tap the chapter title or section listing to select it and the 
device instantly jumps to the place you chose.
Foolish Assumptions
This book was written about the newest e-ink Kindle, known as the 
Kindle Paperwhite (second generation), which was released on 
September 30, 2013. I assume that’s the Kindle version you own, or 
at least have access to, to try out the tips, tricks, and procedures 
that I discuss.
I assume that you have some sort of computer (Windows or Mac) 
that has a USB port so that you can connect your Kindle Paperwhite 
to the port with the USB cable that ships with the device.
I don’t expect you to be a computer genius. However, I assume that 
you know how to navigate on your computer, search the web, tell 
the difference between files and folders, and copy and paste items 
from one place to another.
I assume that you’re familiar with Amazon and have an active account 
there to which you can log in and purchase content.

Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies titles use icons to highlight information. Look for the 
following icons in this book:
	
Quick hints, helpful tips, and other tidbits of information are 
included in the paragraphs that are highlighted with the bull’s-eye 
and arrow.
	
Tie a string on your finger and keep these things in mind. 
Remember items are mostly gleaned from my experience.
	
Although it’s hard to break a Kindle Paperwhite, you can do things 
inadvertently that you might not be able to undo, such as perma­
nently delete a favorite e-book. These pitfalls are highlighted with 
the little bomb in the Warning icon.
	
Occasionally, I provide details of interest to the technically 
curious. This nitty-gritty information is flagged with the 
Technical Stuff icon.
Where to Go from Here
This book is clear, practical, down-to-earth, and full of helpful 
hints. I’ve written 12 chapters, but you don’t need to read them in 
order — each chapter stands on its own. So if you’re interested in a 
particular topic, jump ahead to that chapter.
Have fun exploring your Kindle Paperwhite. For most activities, it’s 
an intuitive and user-friendly device. This book helps you get started 
and guides you to some of the more advanced features that the 
Kindle Paperwhite offers. Tap the screen on your Kindle Paperwhite 
to advance to the next page and keep reading, or use the helpful 
links in the text and in the table of contents to jump to the section or 
chapter that covers a particular topic that interests you.
If you want to go deeper with your Kindle Paperwhite experience, 
consider joining an online Kindle forum. You’ll be able to share 
tips, e-book recommendations, and more with thousands of other 
Kindle owners.
Your Kindle Paperwhite opens a new world of reading, with vast 
libraries of e-books at your fingertips. Enjoy the trip!

Hello, Kindle Paperwhite
In This Chapter

W

elcome to the wonderful world of Kindle reading. Getting 
started with your Kindle Paperwhite is quick and easy. This 
chapter introduces the basic features of the Kindle Paperwhite 
and discusses the first steps in becoming a successful Kindler — a 
Kindle user and reader.
Choosing a Kindle Paperwhite
Before you purchase your Kindle Paperwhite, you need to consider 
the following:
	
✓	How you connect to the Internet: Decide whether you 
want to connect to the Internet using only Wi-Fi (the Kindle 
Paperwhite) or Wi-Fi plus 3G (the Kindle Paperwhite 3G).
	
	Throughout this book, I use Kindle Paperwhite when referring 
to both models. When I need to differentiate between the two 
models, I call them the Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite and the 
Kindle Paperwhite 3G.
	
✓	Whether you want offers and ads on your screensaver: You 
can purchase a Kindle Paperwhite that has special offers and 
sponsored screensavers, or you can buy one with traditional 
screensavers, which do not display advertising.
Mixing and matching among these choices gives you four versions 
of the Kindle Paperwhite:
	
✓	Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite with special offers and 
sponsored screensavers ($119)

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

✓	Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite with traditional screensavers — 
that is, no special offers and no advertising ($139)
	
✓	Kindle Paperwhite 3G with special offers and sponsored 
screensavers ($189)
	
✓	Kindle Paperwhite 3G with traditional screensavers ($209)
In this section, I help you choose your best Kindle Paperwhite.
A brief Kindle history
The first Amazon Kindle became available in November 2007 and sold out in less 
than six hours. Many users back-ordered their Kindles and waited months to 
receive them. The following year, when Oprah Winfrey announced on her television 
show that the Kindle was her “new favorite gadget,” sales skyrocketed, and again, 
the Kindle went out of stock. For two years in a row, the Kindle wasn’t available for 
Christmas shopping!
At a press conference in 2009, Jeff Bezos, accompanied by author Stephen King, 
announced the second-generation Kindle. Also in 2009, the Kindle DX — the larger 
Kindle — and Kindle applications for the PC, Mac, and iPhone became available. 
To the joy of readers around the globe, an international version of the Kindle also 
came out in the fall of that year.
The third-generation Kindle, known as the Kindle Keyboard, became available in 
2010; it was the first Kindle offered with Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi plus 3G. A few months 
after it was released, Amazon started offering a version of the device with special 
offers and sponsored screensavers.
The Kindle had a windfall year in 2011, with three new devices announced and 
released in a two-month span: a basic Wi-Fi –only model, the Kindle Touch, and an 
Android tablet called the Kindle Fire. One of the most exciting innovations at that 
time was the introduction of a touchscreen for the e-ink family of readers.
Kindle had another banner year in 2012, with the debut of a number of devices with 
more options, including the Kindle Paperwhite, which was the first e-ink Kindle 
with a built-in light.
The second-generation Paperwhite was released in October 2013. The latest 
device has better contrast, darker text, and page turns that are 25 percent faster 
than its predecessor.

 Chapter 1: Hello, Kindle Paperwhite

Wi-Fi only versus Wi-Fi plus 3G
How do you decide whether you want a Wi-Fi–only Kindle 
Paperwhite or the Kindle Paperwhite 3G? Good question!
The Wi-Fi –only Kindle Paperwhite requires a Wi-Fi wireless con­
nection to download content from Amazon and other sources. If 
you have Wi-Fi set up in your home, you can use it as your Wi-Fi 
hotspot. You can connect your Kindle Paperwhite also to 
Wi-Fi hotspots in public locations, such as Starbucks and 
McDonald’s.
The Kindle Paperwhite 3G operates not only on Wi-Fi but also on 
the same cellular network as cellphones. In essence, the device 
is available to you everywhere — in your home, office, and car as 
well as in public areas such as airports, train stations, and restau­
rants. Although 3G is widely available, some places in the United 
States don’t have coverage. Amazon provides a coverage map, 
which can be accessed at www.amazon.com/gp/help/
customer/display.html?nodeId=200375890&#whispintl.
	
Best of all, the Kindle Paperwhite 3G, unlike a cellphone, accrues 
no additional charges for 3G coverage. Amazon covers the 3G 
costs.
If you anticipate needing to use only wireless — at home or 
connected to another Wi-Fi network — the Wi-Fi–only Kindle 
Paperwhite is a good choice. On the other hand, if you don’t have 
access to Wi-Fi, you travel regularly, or you just love the magic of 
being able to download an e-book in less than a minute, anywhere, 
any time, you may prefer the Kindle Paperwhite 3G.
Special offers and sponsored 
screensavers
In 2011, Amazon came out with a new option: special offers and 
sponsored screensavers — in other words, advertising on Kindle 
e-readers. In exchange for this, Amazon discounted the price of 
the device — at present, a $20 discount on the price of the Kindle 
Paperwhite. On online forums, users’ reactions to this change have 
been mixed, but mostly positive. Those who are opposed don’t 
like having advertising on their Kindle Paperwhite, period. On the 
other hand, many appreciate the discounts and special offers on 
Kindle e-books and accessories as well as on other products, such 
as clothing and electronics sold through Amazon. The special 
offers appear as screensavers and on a small bar at the bottom of 
the Home screen. No advertising occurs in content on the Kindle 
Paperwhite.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

If you choose a Kindle Paperwhite with special offers and decide 
you don’t like them, you can unsubscribe for $20 — the difference 
in the price that you paid originally. Go to the Manage Your Kindle 
page for your Amazon account (www.amazon.com/myk), choose 
Manage Your Devices, and tap Edit in the Special Offers column to 
unsubscribe. You may resubscribe later at no additional cost if you 
want, but you will not receive a refund.
	 The $20 charge does not include sales tax (for those states that tax 
Amazon purchases).
If you choose a device that includes special offers, the screensaver 
changes regularly. Some people, even if they don’t take advantage 
of the discounts, like the variety of pictures. Traditional Kindle 
Paperwhite screensavers — that is, with no special offers — dis­
play a variety of graphics related to printing, publishing, and 
writing, such as pen nibs and blocks of type.
For international readers
The Kindle was released in November 
2007, but international customers had 
to wait two long years before they could 
buy a Kindle in their country. The latest 
generation Paperwhite, however, is 
sold in the United Kingdom, Europe, and 
Japan through the Amazon store spe­
cific to each country. For example, the 
figure shows the Japanese model, with 
Kanji letters.

(released October 9, 2013)
	✓	Japan: www.amazon.co.jp 
(released October 22, 2013)
Note that the Kindle Paperwhite sold in 
these countries is available as Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi plus 3G, but without special offers 
and sponsored screensavers.

The Paperwhite Screen
Weighing 7.3 or 7.6 ounces (the 3G model is a tiny bit heavier), 
with a 6-inch-high display, the Kindle Paperwhite provides 2GB 
(approximately 1.25 GB available for personal content) of e-book 
storage (and free Cloud storage for all Amazon content), enough 
to store approximately 1,100 e-books and other content. With wire­
less turned off, the light set at 10, and a half-hour of daily reading, 
the battery charge can last up to two months.
Touchscreen technology
The touchscreen technology introduced in the Kindle Touch has 
been further developed and refined in the latest generation of the 
Kindle Paperwhite.
	
The screen on the device uses capacitive technology, which means 
that very light touches with your finger — or a capacitive stylus — 
will cause changes on the screen.
Note that you must use a bare finger or a stylus to use the touch­
screen.
	
The Kindle screen is delicate. Placing heavy objects on top of your 
Kindle, especially those with sharp edges, can damage the screen. 
Dropping your Kindle can also break the screen. To protect their 
investment, many people use covers and screen protectors on 
their device. (See Chapter 10 for more about covers and other 
accessories.)
Let your light shine
The Kindle Paperwhite builds on the best of the past and adds a 
number of innovations. The improvement that is generating the 
most buzz is its built-in light.
Before the introduction of the first Kindle Paperwhite in 2012, 
readers had to use an external light source — the sun, a lamp, or a 
portable reading light. On a Kindle Paperwhite, however, the light 
is sandwiched between the layers of the screen and shines toward 
the surface of the e-ink display. As a result, the light does not shine 
in your eyes as it does with a backlit device, such as a tablet or a 
smartphone. The result? Less eyestrain for you and an overall even 
distribution of light on the screen. The screen and light make 
reading in any lighting condition a pleasure.
You can adjust the light for different lighting conditions by using 
the Light icon on the toolbar. For details, see Chapter 3.

Figure 1-1 illustrates the components that make up the light, touch­
screen, and display. When describing the screen, users note that 
it seems very white, almost like paper, and the letters look like 
they’re floating on the display. The contrast of the fonts against the 
display is darker, too, resulting in a superior reading experience.

The e-ink screen
The Kindle was one of the first widely available commercial 
e-readers to use e-ink in its screen display. E-ink is fundamentally 
different from an LCD screen, such as those found on a laptop, 
smartphone, and computer.
	
With e-ink, thousands of microcapsules of ink are held between 
two layers of polymer. Reversing the electronic charge changes the 
capsules from positive to negative, which changes the color from 
light to dark and, ultimately, results in the display on the screen.
E-ink requires little power, which is why the Kindle battery can 
hold a charge for up to two months with 30 minutes of reading per 
day and the light set at 10. In addition, e-ink isn’t backlit, which 
is less fatiguing for your eyes, and it more closely mimics a paper 
reading experience—that is, looking at ink on the printed page. 
Furthermore, unlike an LCD screen, a Kindle Paperwhite can be 
read in bright sunlight without glare or loss of display.

re you ready to get started with your Kindle Paperwhite? Of 
course you are. In this chapter, you turn on the device for the 
first time, register it, and connect it to Wi-Fi. You also find out how 
to register your Kindle Paperwhite and give it a fun name, the 
differences between off and sleep, and some basics about the 
firmware that runs the device.
Making Your Kindle Paperwhite 
Come Alive
Your Kindle Paperwhite arrives in a simple black box that belies 
the magic that lies inside. Pull off the tear strip, open the box — 
perhaps ooh and aah a bit — and then, let’s get started!
Over the next few pages, you will be doing the following:
	
✓	Turning on the device
	
✓	Selecting a language
	
✓	Turning on Wi-Fi
	
✓	Registering your Kindle Paperwhite

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

First things first: Turn on the Kindle Paperwhite by pressing and 
then releasing the power button.
Figure 2-1 illustrates the bottom of the device, where you’ll find the 
power button as well as the USB port. The power button is the only 
physical button on the entire device.

Figure 2-1: The bottom edge of the Kindle Paperwhite.
If this is the first time you’re using your Kindle Paperwhite, it will 
initiate a booting process, which will take a few minutes to 
complete.
The first option that you will see, after the logo is displayed, is a 
screen for choosing the language for your Kindle Paperwhite. On 
to the next section!
Selecting a Language
Following along from the preceding section, your next task is to 
select a language. After powering on your device, it displays the 
screen shown in Figure 2-2.

 Chapter 2: First Things First 13
Figure 2-2: Select a language here.
Tap the language you want to use for the device, and then tap Next.
	
If you want English but would prefer to see the time displayed 
using a 24-hour clock (for example, 3 p.m. will appear as 15:00), 
choose English (UK).
After you tap Next, the device finishes booting in the language 
you’ve chosen and the Kindle Paperwhite introduction screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 2-3. Tap Get Started to move to the 
next step.
	
Note that you can change your language choice at any time by 
tapping Menu➪Settings➪Device Options➪Language and 
Dictionaries➪Language.
Next up, connecting to a Wi-Fi network.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition
14
Figure 2-3: Hello, Kindle Paperwhite.
Setting Up Wi-Fi
All versions of the Kindle Paperwhite include Wi-Fi; 3G is an 
additional option. If you have a Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite, you 
need to set up Wi-Fi to receive e-books and content wirelessly.
If no Wi-Fi network is in range, you can add a network later by 
tapping the x in the upper-right corner of the Wi-Fi Networks dialog 
box and then tapping Complete Kindle Setup Later.
	
If you do not connect to a Wi-Fi network and you do not have a 3G 
Kindle Paperwhite (see Chapter 1 for a discussion of the different 
types of devices), you will not be able to complete the registration 
process, the step after setting up Wi-Fi. You can register your 
device manually, as detailed later in this chapter.

 Chapter 2: First Things First 15
If you have a Kindle Paperwhite 3G, you don’t have to set up 
Wi-Fi to receive content — 3G works automatically without any 
additional setup. Still, if you have a Wi-Fi hotspot in your home or 
office, you probably want to go ahead and get it working, just for 
convenience.
	
Do you want to send documents to your Kindle Paperwhite 3G 
through e-mail? If you do so using 3G, Amazon will charge you a 
small fee. (See Chapter 7 for details.) Documents transferred by 
e-mail using Wi-Fi are free. Another good reason to set up Wi-Fi!
To set up Wi-Fi, you need to know whether the network is 
password-protected. Home and office networks are usually 
password-protected. Wi-Fi hotspots in public locations, such as 
Starbucks and McDonald’s, are generally not secured with a 
password.
To add a Wi-Fi network to your Kindle Paperwhite, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	If necessary, turn on your Kindle Paperwhite.
	
	
2.	 Tap Menu➪Settings.
	
3.	From the Settings screen, tap Wi-Fi Networks.
	
	 If the Kindle Paperwhite is in Airplane mode (that is, Wi-Fi 
is not turned on), you’ll see a message asking if you want 
to turn off Airplane mode.
	
4.	If you see the message about turning off Airplane mode, 
tap OK.
	
5.	Select the network to which you want to connect, as 
shown in Figure 2-4.
	
	 If the network you want to connect to has a lock icon next 
to its name, you need to enter a password.
	
6.	If the network requires a password, enter it in the Wi-Fi 
Networks dialog box using the onscreen keyboard.
	
	 If you’re connecting to a network at work and don’t know 
the password, see the system administrator.
	
	 You can enter numbers and symbols by tapping the key­
board’s 123!? key. Tap ABC to go back to the regular 
keyboard, as shown in Figure 2-5.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Figure 2-4: My device found this network.
Figure 2-5: This Wi-Fi network requires a password.

 Chapter 2: First Things First 17
	
If you are unable to connect to Wi-Fi, see Chapter 11 for steps on 
adding a network manually.
When your Kindle Paperwhite is connected to Wi-Fi, a wireless 
indicator appears in the upper-right corner of the screen, next 
to the battery charge meter. You see this indicator on the Home 
screen and when you display the toolbar while reading an e-book.
The wireless indicator can be one of the following icons:
	
	
✓	Wi-Fi: The Kindle Paperwhite is connected to a Wi-Fi network. 
The arcs on the fan next to Wi-Fi indicate the strength of the 
Wi-Fi connection.
	
	
✓	3G: The Kindle Paperwhite 3G is connected to a 3G network. 
This icon pertains only to the Kindle Paperwhite that includes 
3G and Wi-Fi. The bars next to 3G indicate the strength of the 
3G connection.
	
✓	1X: The Kindle Paperwhite 3G is connected to a network 
through EDGE/GPRS (the predecessor to 3G in cellular 
network delivery). The 1X icon applies only to the Kindle 
Paperwhite 3G. As cellular networks become more wide­
spread, you will rarely — if ever — see this icon.
Your final step is to register your device. Read on.
Disabling Wi-Fi and 3G
In the Kindle family of devices, you use Airplane mode to disable both Wi-Fi and 3G. 
(Smartphones use the same method and terminology.)
To turn Airplane mode on and off, tap Menu➪Settings➪Airplane Mode. The button 
to the right is an on/off switch. When Airplane mode is enabled, a plane icon 
appears next to the battery charge indicator. When it is turned off, you see the 
wireless indicator (Wi-Fi or 3G).
When you’re on a plane, Airplane mode must be enabled for the entire flight. You’re 
allowed to use your Kindle Paperwhite for reading after the plane reaches an alti­
tude of 10,000 feet and the pilot gives the okay. The Paperwhite itself must be turned 
off for takeoff and landing and anytime the plane is flying at less than 10,000 feet.

Registering Your Kindle 
Paperwhite
If you bought your Kindle Paperwhite through Amazon, it’s deliv­
ered to you already registered. However, if you bought the Kindle 
Paperwhite from a store (such as Target, Staples, or Best Buy) or 
received it as a gift, you need to register it.
If you need to register your device, you’ll see the screen shown in 
Figure 2-6 after you’ve set up Wi-Fi (see the preceding section).
Figure 2-6: Register your Kindle Paperwhite at Amazon.
If you have an Amazon account, tap the Use an Existing Amazon 
Account option. Enter your Amazon account e-mail and password. 
(The Kindle Paperwhite inputs its own serial number, so you don’t 
need to enter it.) Tap Register.
If you don’t have an Amazon account:
	
1.	Tap Create a New Account.
	
2.	Choose Country or Region from the menu that appears 
and then tap Continue.

 Chapter 2: First Things First 19
	
3.	Enter your full name, your e-mail address, and a 
password. Confirm the password and then tap Create 
Account.
	
4.	Enter a payment method and billing address.
	
	 You need to set up a payment method for your account to 
purchase from the Kindle Store. The payment method can 
be a credit card or a gift card purchased from Amazon.
	
5.	Tap Continue Setup.
If you have social networks associated with your Amazon account, 
you’ll be asked to verify that you want to connect those to your 
Kindle. You’ll also have an opportunity to set parental controls. 
You can do both activities later.
That’s it! You can now buy books and other content from Amazon 
and have them delivered wirelessly to your Kindle Paperwhite. 
If you’ve purchased content while waiting for your Kindle 
Paperwhite to arrive, those e-books will appear on the Home 
screen after the wireless is turned on and the device registers 
itself.
After the registration process is complete, a short tutorial will 
begin, showing you the basics of navigating the touchscreen. Don’t 
worry if you forget some of the details they present — the same 
information and much more is covered in the following pages.
When the tutorial finishes, you see the Home screen, which lists a 
welcome letter, the Kindle User’s Guide, and two built-in dictionar­
ies: the New Oxford American Dictionary and the Oxford Dictionary 
of English. (For details on changing dictionaries, see Chapter 8.) 
Any content you have purchased will also be displayed.
If you ever need to deregister and then re-register your device, the 
following steps will guide you through the process.
	
1.	Make sure the wireless is turned on.
	
	
2.	 Tap Menu➪Settings➪Registration.
	
	 When you tap Registration, if your Kindle Paperwhite is 
already registered, you’ll see a warning that you are about 
to deregister your Kindle Paperwhite. Tap Cancel to stop 
this process.
	
3.	Choose to register using an existing Amazon account.
	
4.	Enter your Amazon login credentials (your account e-mail 
and password), and tap Register.

Changing Your Paperwhite’s Name
By default, your Kindle Paperwhite is named Your Name’s 1st Kindle, 
where Your Name is your first name. This name appears in the 
upper-left corner of the Home screen. You can change this name, 
if you want, to something more interesting or fun. For example, 
some people name their Kindles after famous literary characters or 
authors. Others choose meaningful words, such as Catalyst — the 
Paperwhite is a catalyst for reading. You can change the name from 
the device itself or from your computer.
To change your Kindle Paperwhite’s name from the device, follow 
these steps:
	
	
1.	 Tap Menu➪Settings➪Device Options.
	
2.	Tap Personalize Your Kindle➪Device Name.
	
3.	Using the onscreen keyboard, enter a new name for your 
Kindle Paperwhite.
	
	 Some Kindle Paperwhite owners use their name and phone 
number as their Kindle Paperwhite’s name. That way, if 
they misplace their Kindle Paperwhite, their contact infor­
mation is prominently displayed on the Home screen for 
some kindhearted soul who finds the device and wants to 
return it to its rightful owner.
	
4.	Tap the Save button to complete the process.
To change the device name through your Amazon account on your 
computer, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to www.amazon.com/myk.
	
2.	If prompted, enter your e-mail address and password.
	
3.	Click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
	
4.	Click Manage Your Devices, which appears on the left 
side of the screen.
	
	 Your Kindle Paperwhite appears in the list of registered 
devices.
	
5.	Click Edit next to the Kindle’s name.
	
6.	In the dialog box that appears, type a new name and then 
click the Save button.
You can also add personal information or a message to the 
Personal Info section of the Settings menu, as shown in Figure 2-7. 
www.allitebooks.com

 Chapter 2: First Things First 21
For example, you might add “This Kindle Paperwhite belongs to 
your name. If found, please call xxx-xxx-xxxx.”
Figure 2-7: Adding a message to identify your Kindle Paperwhite.
To add information or a message, follow these steps:
	
	
1.	 On the Kindle Paperwhite, tap the Menu icon.
	
2.	Tap Settings➪Personalize Your Kindle➪Personal Info.
	
3.	Use the onscreen keyboard to enter the desired information.
	
4.	Tap Save.
Note that this information appears only in the Personal Info sec­
tion — not on the Home screen — and won’t be readily apparent to 
anyone who happens to be looking at your Kindle Paperwhite.
Power Modes: On, Sleep, and Off
The Kindle Paperwhite has three modes for those times when you 
are not reading it:
	
✓	On: To turn on the Kindle Paperwhite, press and release the 
power button. On a device without special offers, you see the 
page that you last viewed before the device went into Sleep 

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition
22
mode or was turned off. On a Kindle Paperwhite with special 
offers, you see the swipe-screen version of the current special 
offer. Swipe the screen (or tap the bottom of the screen) to 
go to the page you were on when the device went into Sleep 
mode or was turned off.
	
✓	Sleep: To put the Kindle Paperwhite in Sleep mode, press 
and release the power button. A screensaver appears on the 
display.
	
✓	Off: To turn off the Kindle Paperwhite, press and hold down 
the power button for five to seven seconds, until the charge 
indicator light (located next to the power button) blinks. The 
screen shown in Figure 2-8 appears. Select Screen Off and the 
screen will go blank.
	
	Until November 2013, passengers were required to turn off 
their Kindles (all models, including the Kindle Paperwhite) 
when on a plane during takeoff and landing and anytime the 
plane was flying at less than 10,000 feet. However, the FAA 
has recently amended its rules to expand the use of personal 
electronic devices during all phases of a flight— they hope 
to provide passengers with a “gate-to-gate” reading, gaming, 
and video-watching experience. Each airline carrier will be 
able to decide individually how to implement these new rules 
on their planes. As a result, things will be “up in the air” for 
several months as airlines decide how to proceed. The take­
away for Kindle-reading passengers is to listen carefully to all 
announcements from the flight attendants and pilot and, if 
required, to turn off your Kindle during takeoff and landing.
Figure 2-8: Choices when powering off the Paperwhite.
You can easily tell the difference between Sleep and Off modes by 
the presence (or absence) of a screensaver. A Kindle Paperwhite 
that is asleep has something displayed on the screen. When turned 
off, the screen is blank.

 Chapter 2: First Things First 23
	
The Kindle Paperwhite uses its battery power only for page turns, 
so there’s no difference in battery usage between putting the 
device in Sleep mode and turning it off. In general, it’s best to 
simply put the device in Sleep mode instead of turning it off. 
(The device goes into Sleep mode automatically after ten minutes 
of inactivity.)
	
If you want to turn off your Kindle Paperwhite while reading a 
book, do so from the Home screen. Otherwise, the device may lose 
your place. This problem doesn’t occur when you use Sleep mode, 
which is another reason why this mode is preferred over 
completely turning off your Kindle Paperwhite.
Charging Your Device
On the bottom of the Kindle Paperwhite is a micro-USB port for 
the charging cable (refer to Figure 2-1). The cable has a micro-USB 
plug on one end and a standard USB plug on the other. Insert the 
micro-USB plug into the Kindle and the standard USB plug into 
your computer or into a plug adapter, which is then plugged into 
an electrical wall socket.
The Kindle Paperwhite doesn’t ship with a plug adapter. If you 
want to use a plug adapter, you must purchase one or use a 
compatible plug adapter, such as the one that comes with the 
Kindle 2, Kindle KBoard, or iPhone. In addition, the charger that 
comes with the Kindle Fire also works with the Kindle Paperwhite. 
See Chapter 10 for a picture of a plug adapter sold by Amazon.
The Amazon cover
With the introduction of the Kindle Paperwhite, Amazon announced a new cover 
with a special feature: Close the cover to put the device in Sleep mode; open the 
cover to wake up the device. The cover is made of leather and holds the Paperwhite 
securely in a molded frame.
If you have a Kindle Paperwhite with special offers, when you open the cover it will 
take you to a special offers screen. Simply swipe the page and your Home screen 
(or the page you last viewed) appears. (Don’t know how to swipe? See Chapter 3.) 
For other Paperwhites, open the cover and the device displays the Home screen 
or the page you last viewed.
After ten minutes or so of nonuse, the device goes to sleep and displays a screen­
saver. You can wake up the device by pressing the power button or closing and then 
opening the Amazon cover.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

When the Kindle Paperwhite is plugged into a power source and 
charging, the charge indicator light (located next to the power button) 
glows amber. When the device is fully charged, the light turns green.
The first time you charge your Kindle Paperwhite, the process will 
take about four hours. After that, charging through the USB cable 
and a computer takes about three hours and charging through the 
plug adapter takes one to two hours.
	
The battery charge meter is in the upper-right corner of the Home 
screen. I recommend recharging the battery when it has about a 
quarter of a charge remaining. You don’t need to top off the battery 
on a daily or weekly basis.
You can read and use your Kindle Paperwhite while it charges. 
When the Kindle Paperwhite is plugged into an electrical socket, 
the display doesn’t change and you can keep reading. However, 
when the device is plugged into the USB port on a computer, you 
see the following message:
If you want to read or shop on your Kindle while continuing to 
charge over USB, please keep the USB cable attached, but eject 
your Kindle from your computer.
If you want to read on your Kindle Paperwhite while it’s connected 
to your computer, leave it physically connected (or plugged in) to 
the USB port but “eject” the device through the operating system. 
To “eject” your Kindle Paperwhite:
	
✓	In Windows 8: Connect the Kindle Paperwhite to your 
computer, right-click the Paperwhite drive icon, and choose 
Eject from the menu that appears. A notification that it is 
safe to remove the Paperwhite from the computer appears 
on your computer screen; ignore this message. Your Kindle 
Paperwhite will blink and display the last screen viewed.
	
✓	In Windows 7, Vista, and XP: Either left- or right-click the 
Safely Remove Hardware icon in the lower-right corner of the 
taskbar and choose Eject Amazon Kindle. The screen blinks 
and returns to whatever was open previously.
	
✓	In Mac OS X: Press ⌘-E. You can also drag the Kindle icon 
from the desktop to the trash can, or choose File➪Eject.
Updating Firmware
At the core of your Kindle Paperwhite is a small computer, 
complete with hardware, software, and a built-in network platform. 
The software that runs the Kindle Paperwhite is its firmware. 
Firmware is the core that controls how the device works.

 Chapter 2: First Things First 25
Amazon periodically updates the firmware for the device. 
Generally, firmware updates fix minor bugs and glitches that may 
not be apparent to the casual user. However, occasionally a major 
upgrade or new feature is added. For example, with firmware 
update 2.5, Amazon added the capability to sort e-books into 
collections, a feature that had been repeatedly requested by users.
To find out which version of the firmware your Kindle is running, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Menu icon.
	
2.	Tap Settings➪Menu➪Device Info.
	
	 The firmware version is listed, along with the serial number 
and the space available (in megabytes). The newest Kindle 
Paperwhite is included in the fifth generation of the 
devices that have been produced, so the firmware version 
begins with 5. At the time of this writing, the firmware is 
version 5.4.0.
If an update is available, your Kindle Paperwhite will download it 
when you turn on the wireless and connect to a network. If you 
notice a screen that says Your Kindle Is Updating, this is what’s 
happening.
If you’re curious as to whether a more current update is available, 
you can check at Amazon:
	
1.	Go to your Amazon account at www.amazon.com/myk 
and log in.
	
2.	In the left column, choose Manage Your Devices.
	
	 If a software update is available for your Kindle Paperwhite, 
a blue i in a white circle will be displayed.
	
3.	If you see the i in a circle, click the picture of the Kindle 
and follow the onscreen instructions to learn more.
	
	 If updates are available, you’ll see instructions for 
determining whether you need to upgrade the firmware 
and, if so, how to download and manually update your 
Kindle Paperwhite, if you want.
	
You don’t have to manually update your Kindle Paperwhite. 
Necessary updates happen automatically through the wireless 
connection. Just be aware that if the screen looks different or if you 
find new features, the device probably went through an automatic 
update.

Getting to Know Your Kindle 
Paperwhite
In This Chapter
▶	Tapping, swiping, and pinching
▶	Becoming familiar with the icons
▶	Touring the Home screen
▶	Using Page Flip to navigate
Y

our Kindle Paperwhite has exactly one switch: the power 
switch on its lower edge. There are no buttons for turn­
ing pages or accessing menus, as found on earlier generations 
of Kindles. All navigation is done through the touchscreen, with 
finger gestures.
In this chapter, you begin by examining the different finger 
motions as well as where on the screen you use them. With just 
a few simple motions, you’ll be able to open books and other 
content and quickly navigate from place to place on your Kindle 
Paperwhite.
Interacting with the Touchscreen
In this section, you discover some techniques for navigation. If 
you’re a seasoned Kindle Touch or previous generation Kindle 
Paperwhite owner, the following information should be familiar. 
However, if you’re upgrading from a Kindle with buttons or are new 
to Kindle overall, the following primer will get you started.
Tapping, swiping, and pinching
All common uses of the Kindle Paperwhite — opening books, turn­
ing pages, placing bookmarks, and so on — involve a few simple 
touchscreen gestures, such as finger taps and swipes. For the most 

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
28
part, these gestures are consistent throughout your interaction 
with the Kindle Paperwhite. (I point out the few cases where the 
behavior is a bit different than you might expect.)
	
Unlike Amazon’s first generation touchscreen device, the Kindle 
Paperwhite has a capacitive touchscreen, which means that it 
responds only to an ungloved finger or a capacitive stylus that 
mimics a finger’s touch. See Chapter 10 for more information on 
styli.
Tapping
A simple tap is the most common gesture you use with the Kindle 
Paperwhite. See an onscreen button and want to activate it? Tap 
the button. Viewing the list of books on your device? Tap one to 
open it.
When you’re reading a book or other content, you tap to page for­
ward (display the next page), page backward (display the previous 
page), or display a menu of commands. What happens when you 
tap a book’s page depends on which part of the screen you tap; I 
discuss the three tap zones of a displayed page later in this section.
Swiping
Swiping — or sliding — your finger from right to left horizontally or 
diagonally on the screen causes it to page forward. The motion is 
akin to flipping a paper page in a printed book. To page backward, 
reverse the motion with a left-to-right swipe.
When reading a book or other content, you advance the page by 
swiping or tapping.
	
If you want to page forward or backward when viewing a list of 
books on the Home screen, you must swipe, not tap. A tap on the 
title of a book (or other content) on the Home screen opens the 
item for reading.
What happened to the Home button?
Every Kindle before the Paperwhite has a physical Home button that returns the 
device to the Home screen with just a press. On the Kindle Paperwhite, the Home 
button is now a Home icon (it looks like a house), which appears on a toolbar at the 
top of the screen.
If you’re reading a book or other content and don’t see the toolbar, simply tap the 
top of the screen to make the toolbar appear.

 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Kindle Paperwhite 29
	
When swiping, you need to move your finger only a short distance. 
You can probably swipe (or tap) without moving your hands from 
their reading position.
Long-tapping
For a long-tap, also called a tap and hold, you touch and hold down 
on the screen for a few seconds before releasing. In general, a long-
tap results in a special action, depending on what you’re viewing at 
the time.
For example, when viewing a book page, you can long-tap on a 
word to display its definition. When viewing a list of books on the 
Home screen, a long-tap on a particular book displays such options 
as adding the book to a collection and reading its description. If 
you tap and hold down on the title of an e-book sample listed on 
the Home screen, you can buy the book, read the description, or 
delete the sample from the device. (Sampling content is discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 5.)
Pinching and unpinching
When reading a book or other content, place two fingers (or a 
finger and a thumb) on the touchscreen and slide them closer 
together. This pinch motion decreases the font size. Move your 
fingers apart — called an unpinch — to increase the font size. You 
need to move your fingers only a small distance to change the 
font size.
	
You might see a lag between the pinching and unpinching motions 
and a change in the text size. Moving your fingers slowly helps.
Touchscreen zones
The Kindle Paperwhite screen is set up with tap zones, which 
are designed to let you turn pages effortlessly with one finger. To 
get an idea of the location of these zones, see Figure 3-1 (Portrait 
mode) and Figure 3-2 (Landscape mode).
The three zones shown in the figures work as follows:
	
✓	Top zone: This area covers the full width of the screen and is 
approximately 1.25” high. While reading a book, a tap in the 
top zone displays a black bar and two toolbars. The title of 
the book, the Wi-Fi or 3G icon, the battery status, and the time 
are displayed in the black bar. The top toolbar contains the 
Home, Back, Light, Store, Search, and Menu icons. The second 
toolbar contains the Font icon, Go To, X-Ray, Share, and the 
Bookmark icon. At the bottom of the screen, you see the title 
of the current section or chapter of the book along with your

progress, which can be displayed in locations or pages, as 
well as the time left in the chapter or book. Just tap in the 
lower-left corner to cycle through these options. For details, 
see the next section, “Navigating with Icons.”

	The top toolbar is always displayed on the Home screen.
	
✓	Central zone: This area, which is the largest of the three 
zones, covers the middle of the screen to the right of the 
left zone and below the top zone. A quick tap or swipe here 
advances to the next page.
	
✓	Left zone: This area is a long, narrow rectangle approximately 
.5” wide. A tap in the left column moves to the previous page. 
Because this zone is narrow, your tapping has to be precise. 
That said, if you can visualize the zone on the screen, remem­
bering where to tap will be easier.
	 To put your Kindle Paperwhite in Landscape mode, tap Menu➪ 
Landscape Mode. Note that Landscape mode is accessible only 
while in a book.
Navigating with Icons
The Kindle Paperwhite has one physical button on the device: the 
power button. Buttons that were on earlier versions of the Kindle, 
such as Home, Back, and Font, are incorporated as icons in tool­
bars on the screen. These virtual buttons are described in this 
section.
Toolbars when viewing a book
When you open a book and advance through its pages, you see 
the text on the page and progress information at the bottom of the 
screen. That’s it! But if you tap in the top zone on the screen, you 
see the toolbars shown in Figure 3-3. The icons displayed on these 
toolbars are described in the next section.
Home icon
	
	 The Home icon always brings you back to the Home screen, no 
matter where you are or what you’ve tapped. Consider this icon 
your virtual friend.
Back icon
	
	 The Back icon, like the Back icon in a web browser, lets you retrace 
your steps. In some instances, the Back icon acts like the Home 
icon. For example, if you open a book from the Home screen, read 
a few pages, and then tap the Back icon, you return to the Home 
screen — not the previous page you looked at.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
32
In a newspaper or magazine, however, the Back icon works dif­
ferently. See the “Toolbars when viewing periodicals” section for 
details.
Figure 3-3: The toolbars you see when reading a book.
Light icon
	
	 The Light icon controls the built-in light. Tap this icon to display 
the adjustment meter shown in Figure 3-4. The light gradient has 
24 levels, from very dim (1) to very bright (24). To adjust the light, 
tap the plus or minus sign on either end of the meter or tap on the 
meter itself. Play with the adjustment meter in different lighting 
conditions to see what works best for you.
Note that the screen says, “In brightly lit rooms, use a high set­
ting,” and “Use a low setting for dark rooms.” This advice might 
seem counterintuitive, but it is correct. When your eyes become 
accustomed to a dark room, your pupils are dilated and you need 
less light to see. Too bright a light can be painful. In bright light, 
your pupils are constricted and thus need more light to see.

 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Kindle Paperwhite 33
Figure 3-4: The light adjustment meter.
Store icon
	
	 Tapping the Store icon takes you to the Amazon Kindle Store. If 
wireless is turned off, you’ll be prompted to activate it. Note that 
the icon appears dimmed if you’ve turned off access to the Kindle 
Store under Parental Controls.
	
Parental controls allow you to disable access to the web browser, 
the Kindle Store, and the Cloud. In addition, when parental con­
trols are enabled, you cannot deregister or reset your Kindle 
Paperwhite. You might want to disable these features to prevent 
others who might be using your Kindle Paperwhite, such as your 
children, from making unauthorized purchases. You might also 
want to prevent others from seeing what you have purchased by 
viewing your content in the Cloud. To access this feature, tap 
Menu➪Settings➪Device Options➪Parental Controls. Parental con­
trols — and other kid-conscious features — are discussed in detail 
in Chapter 9.
	
If you have a Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite and are not in an area 
with a Wi-Fi hotspot, you can’t connect to the Kindle Store.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
34
Search icon
When you tap the Search icon, the screen displays a Search page. 
Use the onscreen keyboard to type a search term in the search 
field.
To the left of the search field is a drop-down menu. (By default, the 
menu says My Items if you’re on the Home page.) Tap the arrow 
to display your menu choices: My Items, All Text, Kindle Store, 
Dictionary, and Wikipedia. Within a book or a periodical, you can 
also restrict your search to just the book or periodical by selecting 
This Book or This Issue. To search the Kindle Store or Wikipedia, 
the device must be connected to Wi-Fi.
	 When you change the search parameter (for example, selecting All 
Text from the drop-down menu), that choice remains in force until 
you change it again.
Goodreads icon
	
	 When you tap the Goodreads icon, the screen displays the built-in 
Goodreads app. You can look at updates from your friends, view 
your own shelves, or see what your friends are reading. You can 
also add books from your Amazon account, and mark them as 
read, currently reading, or want to read. For books that you’ve fin­
ished, you can rate them from one to five stars.
The Goodreads app is discussed in more detail under social net­
works in Chapter 8.
If you don’t have a Goodreads account, you’ll be prompted to 
create one using your Amazon login credentials.
Menu icon
	
	 The Menu icon is probably what you tap most often when using 
your Kindle Paperwhite. I discuss specific uses of the Menu icon 
throughout this book — turning on and off the wireless, finding the 
settings on your device, or reading annotations and notes. If you’re 
wondering how to do something, no matter what it might be, tap 
the Menu icon first. To close a menu, tap the X in the upper-right 
corner.
Font icon
	
	 The first icon on the second toolbar is the Font icon. Tap the Font 
icon to access the following useful features:
	
✓	Fonts: Change the font size and the typeface by tapping the 
options in the first section shown in Figure 3-5.
	
✓	Line spacing: Tap the boxes to choose tight, average, or wide 
line spacing.

 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Kindle Paperwhite 35
	
✓	Margins: Tap the boxes to change the width of the page 
margin to wide, average, or narrow.
	
	Close the menu by tapping the X in the upper-right corner.
Figure 3-5: Tap the Font icon to change the appearance of text on the screen.
Go To
Tap Go To to display a two-tabbed menu that allows you to quickly 
navigate through a book and your notes. The Contents tab displays 
information such as Cover, Book Info, Beginning (the first page of 
the first chapter), Table of Contents (from here, you can tap and 
move to individual chapters), End (the last location in the book), 
and a specific page or location. The Notes tab displays your notes 
as public notes from other readers. Navigating through a book 
using the Go To feature is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
X-Ray
Tap X-Ray to display a list of words or characters that appear in 
the page, chapter, or book, along with a frequency graph. (For 
details on the X-ray feature, see Chapter 8.) X-Ray appears dimmed 
if the feature is not enabled in the book you’re reading.
Share
Tap Share to open a screen that allows you to type comments 
about the book you’re reading. Comments will be shared to 
Goodreads as well as to Twitter and Facebook, if they are selected. 
You must have your social networks enabled and connected to 
your Kindle Paperwhite to be able to use this feature. (See Chapter 
8 for details.)

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
36
Bookmark icon
	
	 Tapping the Bookmark icon allows you to quickly place a book­
mark at the location you’re reading, to save your place or for future 
reference. Setting a bookmark and using bookmarks to navigate are 
discussed in detail in Chapter 4.
Toolbars when viewing periodicals
Within a periodical, such as a newspaper or a magazine, the tool­
bars are a little different. The main toolbar still contains Home, 
Back, Light, Search, and Menu icons, but the Store icon is replaced 
by the following two icons:
	
	
✓	Cover view icon: Tap this icon to see the list of sections with 
photographs, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6: Cover view of the New York Times.

 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Kindle Paperwhite 37
	
	
✓	Section view icon: This icon displays a hierarchical, text-
based section and article listing, as shown in Figure 3-7. At the 
bottom of the screen are navigation arrows.
	
	 The Back icon returns you to the article listing or the front page. 
Newspaper and magazine content is sorted by lists of articles or 
sections that you scroll through to select what you want to read. 
For tips on reading periodicals, see Chapter 4.
The second toolbar that you see when reading an article in a peri­
odical (such as a magazine or newspaper) is different than the 
one you see when reading a book. Both toolbars sport the Font 
icon. But instead of Go To, X-Ray, and Share, which you see when 
reading a book, you see Clip This Article, as shown in Figure 3-8. 
Tapping Clip This Article to quickly add an article of interest to the 
My Clippings file. (For details, see Chapter 4.)

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
38
Figure 3-8: You see the second toolbar when reading a periodical.
Navigating with Page Flip
Page Flip on the Kindle Paperwhite enables you to move quickly 
through a book and return to your original location, without set­
ting a bookmark. To access Page Flip, swipe up from the bottom 
of the screen. You’ll see a screen within the screen, as shown in 
Figure 3-9.
In the middle of the page, note the left and right arrowheads. Tap 
these to move forward (right) or backward (left) one page at a 
time. You can move forward and backward through a book also by 
swiping across the screen.
At the bottom of the screen is a rectangular navigation pane that 
displays the current chapter and location. Tap the arrows to move 
forward and backward by chapter. (If the publisher hasn’t set 
chapter marks, you see only the progress bar.) You can slide the 
circle on the progress bar to move forward quickly by location — 
think of this as riffling through the book. Tap on the bar to move to 
the beginning of a chapter. When you’re finished, tap the X in the 
upper-right corner to close Page Flip and return to your reading 
location.

 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Kindle Paperwhite 39
Page Flip is a handy feature because it allows you to quickly move 
through a book without losing your place. Do you need to refresh 
your memory on a character’s name? Does the book contain maps 
or photographs? Use Page Flip to navigate to these types of features.
Figure 3-9: The Page Flip navigation screen.
You can use Page Flip to quickly jump to a different part of the 
book (if, for example, you’ve lost your place and didn’t set a book­
mark). After you’ve flipped to the correct location, tap the center 
of the page view screen to jump to that location.
	 The size of the font in the page view screen is smaller than the 
font on the page you’re reading. If the Page Flip view is too small 
to read, increase the size of the font on the page and then restart 
Page Flip. You can’t directly increase the font size within the 
inserted page that you’re viewing on the screen.

n this chapter, I show you the basics of reading on your Kindle 
Paperwhite — a process so simple and elegant that you’ll soon 
forget you’re even using an e-reader.
You also find out how to navigate through your collection of books 
both on your Kindle Paperwhite and in the Cloud. In addition, 
I include information on how to have a stellar experience when 
reading periodicals, such as newspapers and magazines. Along the 
way, I share tips and hints that can save you time and make the 
most of your reading experience.
It All Begins on the Home Screen
The Home screen displays a list of all the content loaded on your 
Kindle Paperwhite. Typically, that content is mostly books but can 
also include games, newspapers, magazines, blogs, and personal 
documents.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
42
	
	 When you turn on your Kindle Paperwhite (by pressing the power 
button on the bottom edge or opening the cover if the device is in 
an Amazon case), it displays your last viewed page or a sponsored 
screensaver, which you swipe to get to the last viewed screen 
(if you’re using a Kindle Paperwhite with special offers). You can 
always go directly to your Home screen by tapping the Home icon on 
the toolbar at the top of the screen. If the toolbar is not ­displayed, just 
tap in the top half-inch of the screen and it will appear.
	
If you’re using the Amazon cover, your Kindle Paperwhite will auto­
matically come out of Sleep mode when you open the cover. If you 
have a Kindle Paperwhite with traditional screensavers, you’ll see 
the last viewed screen. A Kindle Paperwhite with special offers and 
sponsored screensavers will display one of those screens. Give the 
screen a quick swipe to display the last viewed screen.
Figure 4-1 shows a typical Home screen on a Kindle Paperwhite.
Figure 4-1: The Home screen in List view.

 Chapter 4: Reading 43
	
The Home screen on the Kindle Paperwhite with special offers and 
sponsored screensavers displays seven items — one slot for 
­content is taken up by the small special offer banner at the bottom 
of the screen. If you don’t have special offers on your Kindle 
Paperwhite, eight items will be listed.
The Home screen in Figure 4-1 is shown in List view. If you prefer, 
you can view your Home screen in Cover view, which is shown in 
Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2: The Home screen in Cover view.
If you’ve selected By Author or By Title on the Home screen, the 
first page of Cover view displays three covers of your content 
and four covers of something Amazon thinks you might enjoy 
(­top-rated mysteries and thrillers in Figure 4-2). When you tap to 
move to the next page, the Home screen will display six covers 
generated from your content. If you’re viewing your Home screen 
By Collection, generic covers for the collections will be shown. 
The generic collection covers will be mixed in as appropriate in the 
other views.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

	 Perhaps you don’t like seeing Amazon’s recommendations and 
would prefer to see six covers of your content on every screen. 
No problem — you have the option to change the display. Tap 
Menu➪Settings➪Device Options➪Personalize Your Kindle. 
Recommended content is an on/off toggle switch, as shown in 
Figure 4-3.
When you turn off Recommended Content, the screen will display 
six covers, as shown in Figure 4-4.
To switch from List view to Cover view, simply tap Menu➪Cover 
View. To switch back, tap Menu➪List View.

Types of Content
I would hazard a guess that if I picked up a stranger’s Kindle 
Paperwhite, the most common type of content on the device 
I would see would be books. But that’s not the only type of mate­
rial that you can read, as you can see from the following list:
	
✓	Books: Every type of book, from traditional novels to short 
stories, serialized books, Kindle Singles, and more.
	
✓	Periodicals: Newspapers, magazines, and blogs.
	
✓	Docs: Personal documents that you create and send to your 
Kindle whether using Send to Kindle or e-mail (see Chapter 7 
for details on this process). In addition, if you capture ­content 
from the web and send it to your Kindle Paperwhite by using 
the Send to Kindle browser feature, this material will be 
­categorized as a Doc.
	
✓	Active Content: Games such as “Every Word.”

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
46
	
Throughout this book, when I refer to content, I mean any of the 
preceding categories.
Moving around the Home Screen
When you first get your Kindle Paperwhite, you may have only one 
page of content listed on your Home screen. You can easily open a 
book from the list by tapping anywhere on its name. As the amount 
of content on your device grows, however, you’ll want to be able to 
move around quickly and easily.
How do you know how many pages of content you have on your 
Home screen? Look at the bottom-right corner in Figures 4-1 and 
4-4. Note the two numbers separated by a slash. The first number 
is the page you’re on; the second number is the total number of 
pages of content. For convenience, I refer to these numbers as the 
page indicator.
As you add books and other content, your Home screen can 
quickly become many pages long. After all, your Kindle Paperwhite 
can hold about 1,100 e-books! You’ll probably accumulate books 
quickly, given the availability of free material and the ease with 
which you can download content.
What’s more, if you get in the habit of sampling books before you 
buy, your library of content can really start to mushroom! 
(I discuss sampling in Chapter 5.)
So how do you manage your fast-growing library? The following 
sections describe features available from your Home screen that 
help you browse through your library and find books efficiently.
Sorting and displaying content
The top-right corner of the Home screen provides four options for 
sorting content: Recent, Title, Author, and Collections. To change 
the current sort method, simply tap it and then tap your new 
choice. Presto! Your list appears, re-sorted.
	
The Recent option displays the most recent content either 
loaded or viewed on your Kindle Paperwhite. Title, Author, 
and Collections are displayed alphabetically. When sorted by 
Collections, the collections appear first and books not in collec­
tions appear next, sorted by most recent. If you haven’t set up any 
collections, the Collections choice appears dimmed on the menu. 
I discuss how to organize your content into collections in the 
“Creating Collections” section, later in this chapter.

 Chapter 4: Reading 47
You can also restrict the type of content shown on your Kindle 
Paperwhite by tapping the down arrow next to My Items. (By default, 
the device displays My Items, which displays every type of item on 
your device, with the total number of items listed in parentheses.) 
Tap Books, Periodicals, Docs, and Active Content (see the “Types of 
Content” section) to display content only in those categories. The 
number in parentheses will change depending on the number of items 
on your Kindle Paperwhite in that particular category.
Removing content
Although it’s great to keep adding books and other content to your 
Kindle Paperwhite, sometimes you’ll want to remove items — 
whether to save space or because you don’t like clutter. Some Kindle 
users don’t like to re-read books, so they have no reason to keep 
books they’ve read on their device. Whatever the case, realize 
that sometimes removing content is permanent.
If you long-tap a book’s title, you will see that Remove from Device 
is the last choice on the menu that appears. If you purchased the 
book from Amazon, it will be available in the Cloud, which is your 
archive of Kindle books at Amazon. If you remove the book from 
the device, it is still available to you to download via the Cloud.
However, if you have purchased a book from another source, it 
will not be backed up in the Cloud, unless you have sent it to your 
device by using one of the options described in Chapter 7. In this 
case, when you remove the book, it is permanently deleted unless 
you have backed it up on your computer.
	
Unfortunately, the menu doesn’t indicate whether the removal 
is permanent — you need to remember where you acquired the 
­material.
If you long-tap the title of a sample, you’ll see the Delete This 
Sample option at the bottom of the list. Deleting a sample is per­
manent, although you can always download the sample again from 
Amazon.
Paging through the Home screen
If your Home screen has multiple pages, you can flip forward and 
backward through those pages by swiping from right to left 
(to move forward) or left to right (to move backward). Note that 
this swipe can be horizontal or diagonal in List and Cover views, as 
well as vertical (up to move forward, down to go back) in List view.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
48
From the Home screen, you can navigate directly to a page in your 
list of books. Begin by tapping the page indicator at the bottom-
right corner of the screen. A pop-up window appears, allowing you 
to enter a page number to jump directly to the list of content. If 
your Home screen is sorted by Collections, Recent, or Title, you’ll 
also have the option of entering the first few letters of a book’s 
title. If your Home screen is sorted by Author, you can enter the 
first letters of an author’s name. Tap the Go button and you’re 
taken to the corresponding page in your list of content.
Searching from the Home screen
Another way to find a book is to use the device’s powerful Search 
feature, which can scan all your content to find items containing a 
word or string of characters.
	
	 To search from the Home screen, tap the Search icon on the ­toolbar. 
The Search screen and onscreen keyboard appear, as shown in 
Figure 4-5.
Figure 4-5: The Search screen.

 Chapter 4: Reading 49
	
When using the onscreen keyboard, you can access variations 
of certain letters by tapping and holding down on a letter. For 
example, tapping and holding down on the letter E displays accent 
marks and other diacriticals. Enter text by tapping the appropriate 
letters on the keyboard, and then tap the arrow to the right of the 
search box.
The search feature is powerful, and you need to set the parameters 
carefully to make sure you get the results you want. When you 
bring up the search bar, look to the left to see what is displayed. 
If it says My Items, your search will return titles and author names 
that match your search item in content that is on your Kindle 
Paperwhite as well as in the Cloud (your archive) at Amazon. 
Alternatively, if you select All Text, the search will be restricted to 
content on your Kindle Paperwhite, but it will search all the text on 
your Paperwhite, not just titles and author names.
Figure 4-6 shows the results of a search for bride with My Items 
selected. Figure 4-7 shows the same search with All Text as the 
selected parameter.
Figure 4-6: Search results for bride with My Items selected.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
50
Figure 4-7: Search results for bride with All Text selected.
The number in parentheses next to a title indicates the number of 
occurrences, or hits, of the search term. For content on your Kindle 
Paperwhite (All Text parameter), your search results are sorted by 
number of hits by default. Higher relevance is given to books with 
the search word in the title or with many occurrences of the word 
in the text.
You can change the order in which your search options are 
­displayed. At the top of the screen, tap the down arrow next to 
Number of Hits to see the other sort options: Recent (sorts by the 
most recent items loaded on the device or viewed), Title (sorts 
alphabetically), and Author (sorts alphabetically).
	 When you load new content on your Kindle Paperwhite, the device 
automatically indexes it — which is why the search function 
works. Occasionally, though, a file is indexed incorrectly. When 
this happens, you see Unindexed Items at the end of the search 
retrieval list. Unindexed items can quickly drain the battery. See 
Chapter 11 for troubleshooting hints to correct this problem.
Tap on the title of one of the retrieved (searched) items to display 
the results screen. A page highlights the search term in context, with 
the location number and, if applicable, the page number in the book. 

 Chapter 4: Reading 51
Tap the paragraph to go directly to the page in the book (or other 
content) that contains your search term. To go back to the search 
results, display the top menu and tap the Back icon twice.
Selecting a book to read
Any of the methods discussed in the previous sections can be used 
to quickly find books from your Home screen. When you find the 
book you want to read, simply tap the displayed title to open it. 
(If the book is in the Cloud, tap the title to download it and then 
tap it again to open it.)
Viewing content in the Cloud
If you purchase books, magazines, newspapers, or games from 
Amazon, those items are stored in the Cloud at your account. To 
view content in the Cloud as well as on your device, tap Cloud in 
the top left of the screen. When you do so, the number next to My 
Items changes to reflect the number of items stored in the Cloud. 
Items that are in the Cloud and on your device display a check 
mark, as shown in Figure 4-8.
	
Before the introduction of the Kindle Paperwhite, the Cloud was 
known as Archived Items.
You sort and view content in the Cloud the way you do on your 
device. Tap the arrow next to My Items to select All Items, Books, 
Periodicals, Docs, and Active Content. You can also sort items by 
Recent, Title, and Author.
To download content to your Kindle Paperwhite, tap its title. Your 
wireless connection (Wi-Fi or 3G) must be turned on. If wireless is 
not turned on — which means your device is in Airplane mode — 
you’ll be asked if you want to turn off Airplane mode.
You can view items in the Cloud without a wireless connection, but 
Wi-Fi or 3G must be on to download content.
	
Only content purchased from Amazon is automatically available 
for viewing in the Cloud. If you’ve bought or downloaded books 
from other sites and you want to have that material stored in the 
Cloud, you need to move it there. The easiest way to do so is to 
use Send to Kindle, which is discussed in Chapter 7.
	 If you want to use a computer to view your content in the Cloud, 
go directly to your Kindle Library at www.amazon.com/myk.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Moving through a Book
Reading a book on a Kindle Paperwhite is intuitive. To go to the 
next page, tap anywhere on the page, except near the top and 
along the left. (See Chapter 3 for illustrations of the tap zones 
in Portrait and Landscape modes.) Tap near the left edge of the 
­display to move back one page. To see the toolbar, tap near the top 
edge of the display.
As noted previously, you can also swipe left or right to page 
forward and backward, respectively. Page Flip (discussed in 
Chapter 3) is another way to move quickly through a book.
Going to a specific spot
You can also jump directly to various parts of a book. Tap near the 
top of the screen to display the toolbars, and then tap Go To. 
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 4-9.
Figure 4-8: The check marks indicate that content is in the Cloud and on the 
Kindle Paperwhite.

 Chapter 4: Reading 53
Figure 4-9: Use the Go To menu to move to different sections of a book.
Note the two tabs at the top of the menu that display Contents and 
Notes. You use the Contents tab to navigate through the book, and 
the Notes tab to navigate through personal annotations you’ve 
made, as well as popular and public annotations.
	 To see popular and public annotations on the Notes section of 
the Go To screen, you must have Popular Highlights and Public 
Notes enabled. To turn them on, tap Menu➪Settings➪Reading 
Options➪Notes & Highlights. Use the toggle switch to turn on 
Popular Highlights and Public Notes.
When the Contents tab is selected, the list of Go To options may 
differ depending on the book. Here are the options you may see:
	
✓	Beginning: The first words of text in the book.
	
✓	Page or Location: A particular page or location in the book. 
I discuss the concept of page and location as they pertain to 
e-books shortly.
	
✓	Cover: The book’s cover.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
54
	
✓	Book Info or Front Matter: Content that appears before the 
start of the book, such as a dedication and copyright page.
	
✓	Chapter listing: The list of chapters, similar to a traditional 
table of contents. Tap a chapter title or number to go directly 
to that chapter.
	
	If the chapter listing is more than one page long, swipe up 
the list with your finger to advance to additional chapters. A 
scroll bar indicator on the right provides an approximation of 
the length of the list (refer to Figure 4-9).
	
✓	About the Author: Biographical information about the author 
of the book.
	
✓	Recommended Reads: A list of additional books by the same 
publisher or author.
	
✓	End: The end of the book, which displays a page where you 
can rate and share the book on Amazon and Goodreads. If your 
Kindle Paperwhite is linked to Facebook through Goodreads, 
your rating will also be posted to this social networking site.
Setting a bookmark
You can use personal bookmarks to help you navigate through 
a book. To set a bookmark, tap in the upper-right corner of the screen. 
A flag appears, along with the location and chapter (or part) of the 
book, with a plus sign (+) in a circle. To set the bookmark, simply tap 
the plus sign. The flag darkens, indicating the marked location.
	
	 After you set a bookmark, tap the upper-right corner and a small 
menu appears, displaying all the bookmarks that have been set in 
the book. When you tap a bookmarked location, a window insert 
opens on the screen, as shown in Figure 4-10. You can read the 
page from the insert or go directly to it by tapping the page on the 
screen. To return to your former location, navigate by bookmark or 
use the Back icon from the toolbar.
To delete a bookmark, tap the X in the drop-down menu. To add 
the bookmark again, tap +. Note that the display toggles between + 
and X, depending on whether or not a bookmark is set.
Finding your place
The Kindle Paperwhite gives you several options for knowing your 
location in a book.

 Chapter 4: Reading 55
As you read, the area at the bottom of the screen displays 
a ­location number for the text currently in view and a percentage 
­indicating how much of the book you’ve read. Tap the location 
number to cycle through the minutes left in the chapter, the hours 
and minutes left in the book, the location, and when available, the 
page number. Your final choice becomes the default.
All e-books have location information, but not all have page numbers. 
(For example, if a book exists only in e-book form, page numbers are 
not available.) Time to dig into the difference in these terms and how 
you may use them to reference different parts of a book:
	
✓	Location: The concept of a fixed, printed page doesn’t apply 
to e-books because you can vary the font type, font size, line 
spacing, and words per line. These changes affect how much 
of the e-book is displayed on a given screen. Instead of page 
numbers, location is used as a marker to indicate how far you 
are in an e-book. The location remains constant even if the 
screen or font size changes.
	
	One unit of location is equivalent to 128 bytes of information 
in the e-book file.
Figure 4-10: The navigation screen from a bookmarked location.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
56
	
✓	Page number: Many e-books can also display a page number 
that reflects the page number in the printed edition of the 
book. This information is helpful, for example, if you’re in a 
reading group in which some members use Kindles and others 
use printed copies of the book.
	 For e-books that display page numbers, you may be curious as to 
which version of the printed book matches those page numbers. 
You can find this out by going to the e-book’s product details 
on Amazon and opening the drop-down menu next to the page 
number listing. The ISBN for the book that served as the source for 
the page numbers is displayed, as shown in Figure 4-11.
Figure 4-11: Determining the source for page numbers in a Kindle e-book.
Discovering your reading speed
The Kindle Paperwhite can learn your reading speed, so it can 
tell you how many minutes or hours of reading time remain in the 
­current chapter or book.
How does the Kindle Paperwhite determine how much reading 
time is left in a chapter or book? When you first open a book, 
Learning reading speed appears at the bottom of the screen. After 
the device calculates your reading speed, it uses this figure for the 
rest of your reading experience in that particular document.
	
	 The device can relearn your reading speed. This feature is helpful 
if you’ve paged quickly through a book, making the reading speed 
inaccurate. Simply tap the top of the screen to display the toolbar, 
touch the Search icon (see the margin), and type the following:
;ReadingTimeReset
	
	 Tap the search arrow and the device will display 0 search results. 
Tap the Back icon and Learning reading speed will again be 
­displayed at the bottom of the screen.

 Chapter 4: Reading 57
Menu options for books
	
	 When reading a book, you can access useful features by tapping 
the top of the screen to display the toolbar and then tapping the 
Menu icon. The following options appear:
	
✓	Shop Kindle Store: Go to the Kindle Store to browse and find 
e-books.
	
✓	Vocabulary Builder: Open the list of words you have looked 
up in the dictionary.
	
✓	Settings: Toggle Airplane mode on and off and access options 
for Wi-Fi networks, registration, reading, parental controls, 
time, language, and more.
	
✓	Book Description: Display the book’s Kindle Store descrip­
tion. Wireless must be on (that is, Airplane mode must be off) 
to view this information.
	
✓	About the Author: When available, see biographical informa­
tion about the author as well as a list of other Kindle books 
that the author has written.
	
✓	Landscape Mode: Change the orientation of the page from 
Portrait to Landscape mode.
	
	In Landscape mode, you need to tap the top of the page 
(which would normally be the left side of the screen) to 
­display the toolbar.
	
✓	Sync to Furthest Page Read: If you (or others on your 
Amazon account) have viewed the current book on another 
device, you can adjust your location to the furthest page 
read. To reset the furthest page read (for example, if you want 
to ­re-read the book, or if someone else on your account has 
already read the book), go to the book’s listing in Manage 
Your Kindle and select Clear Furthest Page Read in the drop-
down menu on the right.
	
	Select this option if you want to use Whispersync to syn­
chronize your Kindle Paperwhite book with an audiobook 
from Audible. Audiobooks and Whispersync are described in 
Chapter 8.
	
✓	Reading Progress: Select the default for the reading progress 
displayed at the bottom of the screen (location in book, time 
left in chapter, or time left in book).
	
	You can reset the default location also by simply toggling 
through the choices at the bottom of the screen.

Reading Newspapers and 
Magazines
Books are typically organized into chapters, which are read in 
a linear fashion, that is, from beginning to end. Periodicals such 
as newspapers and magazines, on the other hand, usually contain 
a number of articles grouped by section. Readers often choose to 
skip around among sections and articles. Fortunately, the Kindle 
Paperwhite has several special features to enhance the experience of 
reading periodicals.
Basic navigation
From the Home screen, tap the title of the periodical you want 
to read. By default, it opens in a view that displays different 
­sections, with the number of articles in each section. For ­example, 
Figure 4-12 shows the default display from a recent issue of 
Reader’s Digest.
Figure 4-12: The default Cover view of a periodical.

 Chapter 4: Reading 59
Tap the top of the screen to display the toolbar. The Store icon 
you see while reading a book has been replaced by two icons 
that enable you to switch between the default Cover view and the 
Section view. You can think of these views as similar to Cover view 
and List view on the Home screen (see the “Moving around the 
Home screen” section, earlier in this chapter).
Figure 4-13 illustrates the Section view of the Sports Friday section 
of the New York Times. The left side of the screen lists the various 
sections, and the right side lists the articles in the selected ­section. 
The bottom left shows the total number of sections (11) and the 
bottom right displays the total number of articles (20). Tap the 
­section or article you want to read.
You can navigate through the pages of sections and articles by 
using the arrows at the bottom of the screen or by simply swiping 
the screen.
	 You can move forward in a periodical in a linear fashion by tapping 
the title of the next article at the bottom of the screen. The ­percentage 
that appears to the left of this navigation bar shows how far in the 
article you’ve read.

Menu options for periodicals
	
	 When you tap the Menu icon while reading a periodical, you see 
fewer options than those for a book:
	
✓	Shop Kindle Store: Go to the Kindle Store to browse and find 
periodicals and e-books.
	
✓	Vocabulary Builder: Open the list of words you have looked 
up in the dictionary.
	
✓	Settings: Toggle Airplane mode on and off and access options 
for Wi-Fi networks, registration, reading, parental controls, 
time, language, and more.
	
✓	Keep This Issue: Store the periodical on your device until you 
choose to remove it. (When a periodical has already been 
stored, the option changes to Do Not Keep This Issue.)
	
✓	Sync to Furthest Page Read: If you (or others on your 
Amazon account) have viewed the periodical on another 
device, you can adjust your location to the furthest page read. 
If no one else has read this periodical, the choice will appear 
dimmed.
	
✓	View Notes & Marks: Display the highlighted sections, notes, 
and bookmarks for the current periodical.
	
✓	Share: Share articles of interest on Facebook and Twitter. See 
Chapter 8 for more information on using these social media 
sites to share favorite content with your friends.
In addition, the second toolbar sports a Clip This Article option. 
Tap that option to save an article to your My Clippings file. My 
Clippings is listed on your Home screen, just like a book or other 
content. If My Clippings isn’t at the top of the list, swipe through 
the pages — it’s probably at the end.
Reading Comic Books and Manga
Do you enjoy graphic novels, comics, and manga? You can read all 
these on your Kindle Paperwhite. A few special features improve 
the reading experience for these visual documents.
	
✓	Panel view: In a book with multiple panels on a page, 
you can double-tap the screen to enlarge each panel to 
­full-screen for an optimized reading experience. In this Panel 
view, simply tap the screen to advance through each panel 
­individually (see Figure 4-14). When you reach the last panel 

 Chapter 4: Reading 61
(the ­equivalent of reading one page in the print version), the 
screen displays the next page of panels, and then displays 
each panel separately as you tap. In this way, you can see the 
“big picture” but also read each panel easily. Double-tap to 
exit Panel view.
	
✓	Refresh every page: You can set the screen refresh to 
refresh every page in a comic, graphic novel, or manga — 
­independent of the setting you have for other books on your 
device. Tap Menu➪Page Refresh On. The menu will display 
Page Refresh On (as shown in Figure 4-15) or Page Refresh Off, 
depending on what you have selected.
	
If the Page Refresh On option doesn’t appear on the menu, the 
book has probably not been configured to take advantage of this 
feature.
Figure 4-14: This manga provides instructions on how to change to 
single-panel view.

Creating Collections
As you use your Kindle Paperwhite, you’ll likely deal with a long 
and growing list of e-books and other content on the device, and 
putting your fingers on specific content can become challenging.
You can organize this cornucopia of content with collections. 
For example, if you want to keep track of all books you’ve read 
in a given year, you could create a Finished in 2013 collection. 
You might want to put dictionaries and product manuals in a 
References collection. (Note that a Dictionaries collection is 
automatically created for you; it appears at the end of your list of 
content.) Perhaps you want to set up collections for your favorite 
genres: Paranormal, Romance, Horror, Biographies, and so on.
	 For some clever titles for collections, see the list in Chapter 12.
Note that periodical back issues are stored in their own collection, 
following the Dictionaries collection in your list of content. You 
can’t create a collection containing both periodicals and books.

 Chapter 4: Reading 63
To create a collection, follow these steps:
	
	
1.	 From the Home screen, tap the Menu icon.
	
2.	Tap Create New Collection.
	
	 A pop-up window appears.
	
3.	Using the onscreen keyboard, enter a name for the new 
collection.
	
	 A list of your content appears, both on your Kindle 
Paperwhite and in the Cloud.
	
4.	Tap the check box for each title you want to add to the 
collection.
	
5.	When you’re finished, tap Done.
	
	 The collection is created.
You can add books after you’ve created a collection, as follows:
	
1.	From the Home screen, tap and briefly hold down on the 
name of the e-book.
	
	 A set of options appears.
	
2.	Tap Add to Collection.
	
3.	Tap the check box for the collection to which you want to 
add the book.
	
4.	Tap Done.
	
You can assign a book to more than one collection. For example, 
you might put a book in a Finished collection as well as a 
Biographies collection.
After you move your book to a collection, you might be surprised 
to see it appear on your Home screen list. When you sort the Home 
screen by title, collections are listed alphabetically along with all 
the books on your Kindle Paperwhite. If you instead sort the Home 
screen by collections, your collections are displayed in alphabeti­
cal order, followed by any books and other content that aren’t 
assigned to a collection. (See the “Sorting and displaying content” 
section, earlier in this chapter, for details on sorting your content.)
When you view a collection, books on your Kindle Paperwhite are 
displayed in dark letters with a check mark in the right column. 
Items in the Cloud appear dimmed. If you tap a dimmed title, the 
book will be downloaded to your Kindle Paperwhite, assuming 
wireless is turned on and your Kindle Paperwhite is connected. 

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
64
If it is in Airplane mode, a message appears asking if you want to 
turn off Airplane mode. Tap OK and the item will automatically 
download from the Cloud to your Kindle.
	
You can change to Cover view from within a collection. Tap Menu 
Menu➪Cover View.
To remove items from a collection or to delete a collection, open 
the collection and tap the Menu icon. You see options to Add/
Remove Items, Rename Collection, and Delete Collection. Note that 
if you delete a collection, any books contained in the collection are 
not deleted from your Kindle Paperwhite. You can delete a collec­
tion also by long-tapping the collection name on the Home screen.
Reading on Other Devices
E-books purchased from the Kindle Store can be read not only on 
your Kindle Paperwhite but also on the following devices, when 
used with a free Kindle reading app:
	
✓	PC
	
✓	Mac
	
✓	iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch
	
✓	Kindle Cloud Reader
	
✓	Android tablet
	
✓	Android phone
	
✓	Windows phone
	
✓	Kindle for Windows 8
	
✓	BlackBerry 10
	
✓	WebOS
The list of supported devices is likely to grow over time. For a cur­
rent list of supported devices, go to the Kindle Support page (www.
amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html) and choose 
Kindle Help➪Kindle Reading Applications.
To read Kindle e-books on other devices, you need to install the 
free reading app and register those devices to your account. The 
registration process should happen automatically, but you can 
also register from your Manage Your Kindle page (www.amazon.
com/myk). You’re prompted to sign in if you haven’t already done 
so. Tap the Manage Your Devices link, and then scroll down to the 
Registered Kindle Reading App section for instructions for your 
particular device.

 Chapter 4: Reading 65
You can use Whispersync to keep your reading synchro­
nized across all devices registered to your Amazon account. 
Whispersync synchronizes the furthest page read as well as your 
bookmarks, notes, and highlights. Remember that for the synchro­
nization to take place, wireless must be turned on in each of the 
devices to be synced.
Whispersync for Voice allows you to sync between a Kindle edition 
of an e-book and an audio version from Audible.com. See Chapter 8 
for details.
	 If you want to turn off Whispersync, go to the Manage Your Kindle 
page on Amazon (www.amazon.com/myk) and then tap Manage 
Your Devices. The Device Synchronization area provides a link 
where you can turn synchronization on and off.

Y

ou’re holding your Kindle Paperwhite in your hand — it’s 
registered, charged, and ready to go. What do you want to do? 
Read, of course! But to make that happen, you need to have con­
tent on your Kindle Paperwhite. Although the way the wireless 
service downloads content to your Kindle Paperwhite seems 
almost magical, you need to initiate the process. This chapter 
discusses finding content — from books to blogs and everything in 
between — and how to get the treasures you find onto your Kindle 
Paperwhite in the easiest way possible.
Starting Your Search in the 
Kindle Store
The fastest, easiest, and most convenient place to find Kindle 
Paperwhite content is at the Amazon Kindle Store, which makes 
sense because Amazon invented the device.
One common misconception is that you have to buy all Kindle 
content from Amazon. This isn’t true. Although Amazon makes 
shopping for Kindle Paperwhite content simple, you can find 
plenty of other online stores that sell Kindle-compatible e-books, 
as discussed later in this chapter in the “Checking Out Other 
Online Stores” section.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Searching and browsing on 
your computer
Amazon has a specific Kindle Store that makes it easy to search 
for Kindle Paperwhite content. Using your computer, go to www.
amazon.com. From the Search drop-down list, choose Kindle Store to 
restrict your search to Kindle-specific content, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1: Restricting your search to the Kindle Store.
In the Search field, type the words for your search. Do you have 
a specific book in mind? Type a few words of the title. Are you 
looking for books by a particular author? Type the author’s name. 
Are you interested in deep-sea diving — or any other subject that 
tickles your fancy? Type a few words, click the Go button to the 
right of the Search field, and voilà! If anything on the topic is in 
the store, it appears in the search results. With millions of Kindle-
compatible e-books in the store and 180,000 exclusive Kindle titles 
(as of this writing), something will probably appear!

 Chapter 5: Finding Content 69
Just for fun, I entered archery and received an interesting assortment 
of results (416 in all): a variety of non-fiction e-books including a 
history of bows and arrows; how to make a crossbow; how to fletch 
(or put feathers on) arrows; the Zen of archery; Kyudo, the Japanese 
art of archery; a business plan for an archery store; and novels such 
as The Last Elf of Lanis by K. J. Hargan. Several other books were also 
available for loan through the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. (See 
Chapter 6 for more about borrowing books through this program.)
If you’re more of a browser and less of a searcher, Amazon makes that 
easy, too. After you choose the Kindle Store and tap Go, a bar appears 
below the search bar, listing the departments in the Kindle Store:
	
✓	Buy a Kindle
	
✓	Kindle eBooks
	
✓	Advanced Search
	
✓	Daily Deals
	
✓	Free Reading Apps
	
✓	Kindle Singles
	
✓	Newsstand
	
✓	Accessories
	
✓	Discussions
	
✓	Manage Your Kindle
	
✓	Kindle Support
	
One frequently asked question at KBoards.com is “How do I 
contact Kindle support?” Just click the Kindle Support link, as 
shown in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2: Click the Kindle Support link to find help.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Click the Kindle eBooks link, and you land on a page that should 
happily satisfy your browsing dreams. In the center of the page are 
lists such as Kindle Select 25, which features 25 noteworthy books 
for the week, New & Noteworthy Kindle Books, Picks for You, and 
other options (note that this page changes frequently) with the 
book covers prominently featured.
The left side of the page includes multiple categories to start your 
search, with Kindle Book Deals at the top of the list. Here you’ll 
find Kindle Daily Deals, Monthly Deals ($3.99 or less), and the Big 
Deal — up to 80 percent off more than 350 books. The next category, 
Popular Features, includes Kindle Best Sellers, The New York Times 
Best Sellers, and Editor’s Picks. Third on the list are categories for 
searching specific topic areas, so you can drill down a bit more 
while browsing. Gay & Lesbian? Travel? Click the link, and you’re 
presented with a plethora of choices to capture your fancy. The last 
four categories are More to Explore, Newsstand, Kindle Gifts, and a 
link to obtain help.
The right side of the page shows a number of lists that are updated 
hourly, including the Top 100 Paid and Top 100 Free. Kindle Daily 
Deals are featured prominently at the top of the screen, along with 
a button to allow you to subscribe so you never miss a single deal.
	
Even though over a million Kindle-compatible e-books are in the 
Kindle Store, millions upon millions of printed books are in the 
world. Unfortunately, they aren’t all available in a Kindle edition. 
If a particular book you want is for sale at Amazon (U.S.) in print 
form but not in a Kindle edition, click the Tell the Publisher! I’d 
Like to Read This Book on Kindle link on the book’s product page. 
Does clicking the link make a difference? I suspect that it does. For 
example, popular author J. K. Rowling was originally opposed to 
e-books, but the Harry Potter series became available as e-books 
in 2012. The Potter books are available also to borrow for free 
through the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. Consumer demand 
likely influenced these changes.
Searching and browsing on 
your Kindle Paperwhite
	
	 “Wait a minute!” I hear you saying, “I don’t want to use my 
computer to search for e-books. Can I search from my Kindle 
Paperwhite?” Of course you can! Simply tap the Store icon on the 
toolbar. If the wireless is not turned on, you will receive a message 
to take your Kindle Paperwhite out of Airplane mode, as shown in 
Figure 5-3.

 Chapter 5: Finding Content 71
Figure 5-3: Turn off Airplane mode to connect wirelessly.
	
If you have a Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite, you need to be some­
where with a Wi-Fi hotspot. If you have a Kindle Paperwhite 3G, 
you should be good to go anywhere that has 3G service.
	
	 When the wireless is on and has a good connection, tap the Shop 
in Kindle Store icon (see the margin) or tap the Menu icon (also in 
the margin) and select Shop in Kindle Store from the drop-down 
menu that appears. Either way, you see a page similar to the one 
shown in Figure 5-4 when you connect to the Kindle Store.
Figure 5-4: Browse for e-books and more from your Kindle Paperwhite.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
72
At the top of the screen, you have the option to browse Books, 
Newspapers, Kindles Singles, Kindle Serials, Kindle Worlds, and 
Magazines. As you move down the page, you can browse the 
Daily Deals, Monthly Deals, Best Sellers, Kindle Select 25, Best of 
the Month, Things to Try, and New & Noteworthy. At the 
time this screenshot was taken, the list also featured 2013 
Pulitzer Winners.
The bottom panel changes frequently. In Figure 5-4, it displays 
the Best of 2013. Other times, the bottom panel might feature 
Recommended for You, which are books that might be of interest 
to you based on your purchases. The more you buy from Amazon, 
the more tailored the recommendations are to your interests.
At the top of the screen is a Search field so that you can search the 
store, just as you do from your computer. Tapping in the Search 
field displays the onscreen keyboard. Type an author’s name, the 
title of a book, or a search term.
To exit the store and return to the Home screen, tap the Home icon 
or the Back icon.
Sampling content
When you find a book that intrigues you, you can send a sample 
to your Kindle Paperwhite to decide whether you really want 
to purchase it. Samples consist of the first 10 percent of the 
book, which is usually enough to give you a flavor of the writing. 
Sampling isn’t perfect, however; sometimes the first 10 percent of 
a book is mostly the front matter (the table of contents, foreword, 
acknowledgments, and so on), and you never get to the good stuff. 
However, based on my experience, this problem occurs less fre­
quently than it did in the early days of Kindle e-books. Publishers 
seem to be aware of the issue and are formatting their e-books so 
that relevant content is included in the sample, allowing a potential 
buyer to make an informed purchase decision.
If you enjoy the sample and want to buy the book, you can do 
so in a number of ways. The easiest method is to tap the top of 
the screen to display not only the top toolbar but also a special 
bottom toolbar that appears only in samples (see Figure 5-5), 
and then tap Buy for price. In the figure, the price of the book 
is $9.73.
A second method is to purchase the book when you reach the end 
of the sample, as shown in Figure 5-6. Just tap the Buy Now link to 
purchase the book.

 Chapter 5: Finding Content 73
Figure 5-5: The toolbars you see in a book sample.
Sampling books on multiple devices
You can have multiple Kindles as well as other devices running the Kindle appli­
cation (PCs, smartphones, and so on) registered to your Kindle account. You can 
register a new Kindle Paperwhite either from the device or from your computer 
via your Amazon account (see Chapter 2 to find out how to register your Kindle 
Paperwhite). For other devices, download the Kindle app and register using the 
device. More details on this process are in Chapter 4.
If you search or browse for Kindle content from your computer, you can send a 
sample to any of the devices registered to your Kindle account, including devices 
that run the Kindle app, such as the iPhone, an Android phone or tablet, or other PCs. 
If you search for content on your Kindle Paperwhite, you can send a sample only to 
the Kindle Paperwhite on which you’re doing the searching. Samples are not saved 
to the Cloud; they are sent only to the specified device.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
74
Figure 5-6: Buy the e-book when you finish the sample.
Note that for these options, you’ll see a prompt to turn on wireless 
if necessary.
When you choose a Buy option (as opposed to visiting the store) 
you’re taken to the book’s product page at Amazon. Even though 
you see this page, you can’t browse — the purchase is made 
immediately and your account is charged, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-7: The screen you see when you purchase a book.

 Chapter 5: Finding Content 75
Note, however, that you can cancel the purchase from the screen 
shown in Figure 5-7. If you cancel the purchase, a screen similar 
to the one shown in Figure 5-8 is displayed.
Figure 5-8: A cancelled purchase on the Kindle Paperwhite.
After you purchase the book, your Kindle Paperwhite automati­
cally takes you to the correct location in the book (where you left 
off in the sample) and deletes the sample from your device.
	
You can’t buy e-books or other content from your Kindle 
Paperwhite without a wireless connection, either Wi-Fi or 3G. On 
the other hand, if you buy an e-book while browsing on your PC 
and send it to your Kindle, that purchase is queued and sent to 
your Kindle the next time you turn on wireless, whether it be 
minutes, days, or weeks later.
Locating superior subscription 
content
Kindle Paperwhite content isn’t restricted to just e-books. In fact, 
one of the earliest selling points of the device was the capability to 
subscribe to Kindle versions of popular magazines, newspapers, 
and blogs. This type of content has been steadily increasing over 
the years. At present, several hundred magazines, newspapers, 
and blogs are available.
You have two options available for acquiring this type of content — 
an ongoing subscription or the purchase of a single issue. Per issue 
prices for a subscription will be less than the price to purchase a 
single issue, and both will usually be less than a traditional sub­
scription or a print purchase. I say usually because you may find a 
bargain or deeply discounted subscription price that would be less 
than a Kindle subscription. If price is the determining factor, do 
your homework and shop around. On the other hand, if decreasing 
the clutter in your home is important and you want the convenience 
of wireless delivery daily, weekly, or monthly, you may find that a 
Kindle subscription is a viable option.

Some subscription content is available for free online, such as 
certain newspapers. So why pay for a Kindle Paperwhite subscrip­
tion? If you commute on a train or a bus, the convenience of having 
the paper on your Kindle Paperwhite might be the deciding factor. 
On the other hand, if you like to read the paper on your computer, 
a subscription might not be a smart purchase. Keep in mind that 
Kindle subscriptions don’t include advertising, whereas online 
periodicals often do.
Further, some online periodicals restrict content and make it avail­
able only to subscribers. For example, The New York Times limits 
nonsubscribers to ten articles per month online. Subscribers have 
unlimited access to the online edition, the complete archives of The 
New York Times, plus the convenience of having the paper delivered 
directly to the Kindle Paperwhite every morning at 4 a.m. (EST).
All Kindle subscriptions come with a minimum 14-day (newspa­
pers) or 30-day (magazines) free trial. Special promotions may be 
offered with 90-day free trials for subscription content. You can 
cancel any time during the trial, whether it is 14, 30, or 90 days. 
If you don’t cancel, your subscription begins automatically at the 
end of the trial period. Of course, you can cancel a subscription at 
any time, even after subscribing; you’ll receive a pro-rated refund 
on the unused portion. Please note that the trial (14, 30, or 90 
days) is a one-time option — if you cancel and then decide later 
you want to subscribe, even if many months have passed, your 
new paid subscription starts immediately.
Kindle subscriptions can be confusing because they have lots of 
quirks that are generally not an issue with e-books. Recognize that 
many of these exist because of the way the publisher has decided 
to format and distribute the content, and thus these issues are not 
under the control of Amazon. Here are some things to be aware of:
	
✓	The Kindle Paperwhite is a grayscale device. Magazines 
and newspapers that rely heavily on color photographs don’t 
look the same on the Kindle Paperwhite. For this reason, your 
reading experience may not be pleasurable.
	
✓	Content in the print edition may not be included in the Kindle 
subscription version. For example, the New Yorker doesn’t 
include its full complement of cartoons, and National Geographic 
doesn’t include all the pictures found in the print edition. You 
should definitely take advantage of the free trial to determine 
whether you will find the content, as presented, satisfactory.
	
✓	Not all periodicals are available for all devices, such as 
smartphones and the Kindle for PC app. Which devices are 
supported is clearly identified on the subscription page. For 
example, if you hope to read your subscription to the New 
Yorker on your iPhone, you’re out of luck.

 Chapter 5: Finding Content 77
	
✓	Unlike e-books, subscription content can be read only on 
one Kindle. You can’t share subscriptions among devices, 
although you can change the device to which the subscription 
is delivered.
	
✓	Only recent issues of newspapers and magazines and recent 
blog entries remain available on your device. Older issues 
of e-newspapers and e-magazines and older blog entries are 
deleted automatically from your Kindle Paperwhite to make 
room for additional content.
	
Older issues of newspapers and magazines appear inside the 
Periodicals: Back Issues grouping, which usually appears at 
the end of the content listing. Select the grouping by tapping it. 
The screen displays the back issues you have on your Kindle 
Paperwhite. Older newspaper and magazine issues are automati­
cally deleted to free space for new content. The word Expiring 
next to a magazine or newspaper issue indicates that it’ll be 
deleted soon.
If you want to keep a copy of an issue on your Kindle Paperwhite, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the specific issue from the listing of periodicals.
	
2.	Tap the top of the screen to display the toolbar.
	
	
3.	 Tap Menu➪Keep This Issue.
When you choose to keep an issue, Keep will be displayed to the 
right of the title. Another way to keep an issue is to tap and hold 
down (long tap) on its title. When the pop-up menu appears, select 
Keep This Issue.
	
You can delete a saved issue by following the preceding steps but 
selecting Do Not Keep This Issue from the menu in Step 3.
Expanding on the traditional: 
Looking for games and apps
Games, such as Mahjong, Solitaire, and Blackjack, are also avail­
able for your Kindle Paperwhite. Some people are purists and 
believe that the Kindle Paperwhite should be used only for read­
ing; others like having the option of playing a game every now and 
then. Given that many games are offered for free or put on sale 
on a regular basis, go ahead and download one and see what you 
think. I’ve become enamored with “Every Word”, an anagram-type 
word game developed by Amazon. The touchscreen on the Kindle 
Paperwhite is ideal for playing this game.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
78
In general, games are played individually, so wireless doesn’t need 
to be on to play a game.
Games can’t be sampled — if you’re interested in playing 
Blackjack, you need to buy it. Therefore, it’s a good idea to read 
the reviews posted at Amazon to decide whether the format and 
method of playing will be acceptable to you.
	
Not all the Kindle games that are for sale at Amazon work on the 
Kindle Paperwhite. Make sure that you see the name of your Kindle 
Paperwhite in the Deliver To drop-down list (under the Buy Now 
button) before making a purchase.
	
Kindle content, including games, can be returned within seven 
days for a refund. You can return e-books through Manage Your 
Kindle at your Amazon account. To return games, however, you 
must contact customer service directly; you can’t process a return 
for a game from your Kindle Paperwhite or from your Kindle 
account at Amazon.
Checking Out Other Online Stores
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you don’t have to purchase 
e-books from Amazon. E-bookstores are popping up all over the 
Internet, and with the popularity of the Kindle family of e-readers, 
most of these stores sell Kindle-compatible content. Publishers 
may also sell content directly from their websites. Exploring differ­
ent options allows you to find some hidden gems. Similarly, if you 
have specific reading preferences — romance or science fiction, for 
example — specialized stores may have more in-depth selections 
and greater availability of titles in your genre of interest.
The following list is not exhaustive but is a sampling of what can 
be found at various online booksellers:
	
✓	General indie (independently published) e-books: 
Smashwords (www.smashwords.com)
	
✓	Romance: All Romance eBooks (www.allromanceebooks.com)
	
✓	Science fiction, speculative fiction, and paranormal 
romance: Baen (www.baen.com)
	
✓	Nonfiction: Omnilit (www.omnilit.com/)
	
✓	Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender fiction: LGBT 
e-Bookshop (www.lgbtbookshop.com/)
	
✓	Horror and dark fiction: Darkfuse (www.darkfuse.com)

 Chapter 5: Finding Content 79
Buying from an e-bookseller
In general, purchasing from an e-bookseller is a straightforward 
process that involves the following steps:
	
1.	Register for an account with the seller.
	
	 The seller usually requires your name, address, and e-mail 
address, as well as information about your preferred form 
of payment (credit card or PayPal are typical).
	
	 Some sites e-mail your Kindle purchases directly to your 
Kindle Paperwhite. If that’s the case with the seller, enter 
the information it needs when you register.
	
	 You can find your Kindle Paperwhite’s e-mail address in the 
Manage Your Kindle section of your Amazon account. You 
can also find it directly from your Kindle Paperwhite. Tap 
Menu➪Settings➪Device Options➪Personalize Your Kindle. 
The Send-to-Kindle Email is the fourth item in the list that 
appears. (See Chapter 7 for instructions on how to change 
your Kindle Paperwhite’s e-mail address.)
	
2.	Add the e-bookseller to the approved list of senders who 
can deliver content to your Kindle Paperwhite.
	
	 To do this, on your computer:
	
a.	Log in to your account at Amazon, choose the Manage 
Your Kindle option, and in the column on the left side 
of the page, click Personal Document Settings.
	
	Your Kindle Approved e-mail list is in the middle of the 
page.
	
b.	Add the partial e-mail address for the e-bookseller by 
clicking the Add a New Approved E-mail Address link.
	
	Adding a partial e-mail address, such as @ebook­
seller.com, authorizes multiple senders from that 
account to send content to your Kindle Paperwhite.
	
	 Make sure to add your own e-mail address(es) to your 
Kindle Approved e-mail list so that you can send 
documents to your Kindle Paperwhite.
	
	 When you e-mail content to your Kindle Paperwhite, 
Amazon charges 15 cents per megabyte with a 3G wire­
less connection but has no charge for content delivered 
via Wi-Fi. Note that this fee applies to users in the United 
States. 3G wireless transfers are 99 cents per megabyte 
outside the United States.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
80
	
	 If you set your maximum delivery charge to zero cents 
under Whispernet Delivery Options in your Personal 
Document Settings, Amazon will deliver e-mailed content 
only when you have a Wi-Fi connection.
	
3.	Browse and identify e-books you want to buy and then 
add them to your shopping cart.
	
4.	At the time of purchase, select the format for your 
e-book.
	
	 Ideally, you want to buy e-books with a PRC extension, the 
preferred format for the Kindle Paperwhite. If PRC isn’t 
available, look for MOBI. Other, less desirable choices are 
TXT or PDF.
	
	 Do not purchase e-books that are listed as secure 
Mobipocket or secure MOBI because they do not work on 
the Kindle Paperwhite!
	
5.	Complete your purchase by either having the file 
e-mailed to your Kindle Paperwhite (if that’s an option 
through the site) or downloading the file to your 
computer.
	
Files purchased outside Amazon are not stored in the Cloud. You 
need to back up the files on your computer. Some e-booksellers 
offer a digital archive of purchases you’ve made. Read the terms 
of service to see whether they offer this feature. You may want to 
check for restrictions on the number of files that can be stored 
and the length of time that your digital library will remain active.
	
An e-bookseller might go out of business, so it’s a good idea to 
back up content you purchase from sources other than Amazon.
Choosing a compatible file format 
for purchased e-books
The following formats are compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite:
	
✓	AZW is the proprietary format developed by Amazon for its 
Kindle-compatible e-books. Content purchased from Amazon 
has an AZW extension; note that AZW may be followed by a 
number, such as 1, 2, or 3.
	
✓	MOBI is a file format developed by Mobipocket; it’s widely 
used and compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite. Note, 
however, that secure Mobipocket or secure MOBI files 
do not work on a Kindle Paperwhite.

 Chapter 5: Finding Content 81
	
✓	PRC, which stands for Palm Resource Compiler, is equivalent 
to MOBI and is the standard file format for books purchased 
at sites other than Amazon for the Kindle family of e-readers.
	
✓	TXT is a simple text file.
	
✓	PDF is the Adobe Portable Document Format. The last 
few generations of Kindle e-readers, including the Kindle 
Paperwhite, have a built-in PDF reader. You can send or e-mail 
the file to your Kindle Paperwhite or copy it to the Kindle 
Paperwhite via USB. Details on sending files are discussed in 
Chapter 7.
DOC and DOCX are files created by Microsoft Word, a word-pro­
cessing program. A Word document can be converted to work on 
the Kindle Paperwhite. The easiest method for conversion is to 
send the file to your Kindle Paperwhite using the Send to Kindle 
app from Amazon. You can also e-mail the file to your Kindle e-mail 
address. I discuss these options in Chapter 7.
	
ePub is a common file format that you may encounter; note that 
ePub formatted books are not compatible with the Kindle 
Paperwhite.
Transferring files from your computer 
to the Kindle Paperwhite
Although e-mailing or sending a document to your Kindle 
Paperwhite is fast and easy (see Chapter 7), connecting your 
Kindle via USB cable and transferring books via drag-and-drop 
is a simple process too.
Both Macintosh and Windows users can download and transfer 
Kindle content and personal documents from their computers to 
their Kindles through the USB connection. When the Kindle 
is plugged into a computer, it appears as a removable 
mass-storage device.
To transfer files via USB cable, your computer must meet the 
following system requirements:
	
✓	PC: Windows 2000 or later
	
✓	Macintosh: Mac OS X 10.2 or later
	
✓	USB port: An available port or an attached USB hub with an 
available port

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
82
To connect your Kindle Paperwhite to your computer:
	
1.	Plug the larger end of the USB cable into an available USB 
port or a powered USB hub connected to your computer, 
and connect the other end of the USB cable to the micro-USB 
port on the bottom of the Kindle Paperwhite.
	
	 When connected to the PC, the Kindle Paperwhite goes into 
USB drive mode and its battery is recharged by the com­
puter. Wireless service is temporarily shut off. The Kindle 
isn’t usable as a reading device while in USB drive mode 
but returns to your reading location when you eject the 
device from your computer.
	
2.	When your Kindle Paperwhite is connected, simply 
drag and drop (or copy and paste) the file from your 
computer’s hard drive to the Kindle Paperwhite’s 
Documents folder.
	
	 If you put the file in the root drive instead of the Documents 
folder, it won’t appear on the Home screen of your Kindle 
Paperwhite.
Discovering Sources of 
Free Content
You can find many sources of free content. The quickest and easiest 
way to find free e-books, games, and other offers that are available 
at Amazon is to search the Top 100 Free category in the Kindle 
Store. Not all the free e-books are restricted to classics; various 
publishers run special promotions to entice readers to try new 
authors — often on the eve of a new e-book release. You need to be 
quick, though — many times the freebie is available only for a few 
days before it goes back to the regular price.
Another option is to visit KBoards at www.kboards.com/. 
Members there maintain a monthly thread that lists free e-books 
from a variety of sites. The list is updated regularly to show when 
the e-book is no longer free.
	
When you order an e-book from Amazon, even if it is free, it 
appears as a purchase with a purchase price of $0.00. You receive 
a confirmation e-mail, too, so don’t be surprised. Yes, you have 
“bought” the e-book, even if you didn’t have to pay anything for it. 
Free books from Amazon are stored in the Cloud and available to 
you, even if the free promotion ends.

 Chapter 5: Finding Content 83
	
Read the fine print carefully. Many free offers are restricted to cer­
tain countries or territories. Make sure the price is listed as $0.00 
before you opt to buy.
In addition to Amazon, a number of sites offer free e-books, all 
available to you legally:
	
✓	Project Gutenberg: One of the original free e-book sites, 
Project Gutenberg, at www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_
Page, includes 42,000 books that have been digitized with the 
help of thousands of dedicated volunteers. All e-books were 
originally published by bona fide publishers; the copyrights 
have since expired. You can search by author or title, or 
browse by category, by most recently updated, or by Top 100. 
Project Gutenberg includes e-books in languages other than 
English, ranging from Afrikaans to Yiddish.
	
✓	Internet Archive: This site features millions of rare, out-of-print 
works in multiple languages and formats. It’s especially useful for 
academic work. Visit www.archive.org/details/texts.
	
✓	Open Library: This site, at http://openlibrary.org, 
includes 20 million user-contributed items and over 1 million 
e-books in multiple editions and formats. Their goal is “One 
web page for every book ever published.”
DRM and piracy
Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a method for securing digital content so that 
an e-book (or music file or whatever else) can be read or used only on an autho­
rized device.
When Amazon first started selling Kindle e-books, they were encoded so that they 
were specific to the device. Authors who sold through their Desktop Publishing 
(DTP) platform were required to upload DRM-encrypted files. The DTP require­
ments have since been eased so that DRM is no longer required, although many 
books sold on Amazon still have DRM.
A discussion of the ethics of DRM is beyond the scope of this e-book. Just know 
that before you buy an e-book from a site other than Amazon, make sure that the 
format is compatible with your Kindle Paperwhite and isn’t encoded in such a way 
that would render the e-book unreadable.
Piracy is the other side of the DRM coin — or what DRM is trying to prevent. If a file 
isn’t encoded, it can be shared freely with any number of other readers. Piracy is steal­
ing e-books and taking money out of the pocket of the author and publisher. Please 
don’t engage in this illegal activity.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

✓	FreeTechBooks.com: This site lists free online computer 
science, engineering, and programming e-books, e-textbooks, 
and lecture notes, which are all legally and freely available 
over the Internet. Go to http://freetechbooks.com.
	
✓	manybooks.net: You can find classic texts at http://
manybooks.net that are copyright-free, ranging from Alice 
in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (CreateSpace) to Zambesi 
Expedition by David Livingstone (Kessinger Publishing). You 
can also find new fiction by emerging authors. All the texts 
offered on the site are free to U.S. users. Most titles are offered 
in a variety of formats, including AZW, which works on the 
Kindle Paperwhite.
	
✓	Feedbooks: This site is another source of free, public domain 
e-books. Visit www.feedbooks.com/publicdomain.
	
	The Feedbooks website includes a section with paid content. 
These e-books are not compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite, 
so don’t purchase one in error! Only the free public domain 
e-books at Feedbooks work on your Kindle Paperwhite.

Gifting
In This Chapter
▶	Letting friends borrow an e-book
▶	Borrowing books from the library
▶	Checking out the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library
▶	Giving a book as a gift
Y

our Kindle Paperwhite has several innovative features 
that give you new ways to lend e-books to others, borrow 
from libraries and Amazon (through the Kindle Owners’ Lending 
Library), and give e-books as gifts.
Loaning Books
You can loan an e-book to anyone — even if the person doesn’t 
have a Kindle! All you need is the person’s e-mail address and a 
book that has loaning enabled.
You can loan e-books from your computer. Follow these steps to 
lend an e-book to a friend:
	
1.	Open a web browser on your personal computer and go 
to the Manage Your Kindle page (www.amazon.com/myk).
	
2.	If necessary, log in.
	
3.	Scroll down to view the e-books in your Kindle Library.
	
4.	Hover the cursor over the Actions button for the e-book 
you’d like to loan, and click the Loan This Title option (if 
it appears).
	
	 You’ll see this option if loaning has been enabled for the 
e-book.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
86
	
5.	Enter the person’s e-mail address and name. You may 
also type a message if you want.
	
	 The borrower of the e-book receives an e-mail from 
Amazon, similar to the message shown in Figure 6-1. The 
borrower has seven days to accept the loan by clicking the 
Get Your Loaned Book Now button provided in the e-mail.
Click this button to accept the loan
Figure 6-1: When you loan an e-book, Amazon sends an e-mail to the borrower.
What if the person you’ve loaned the e-book to doesn’t have a 
Kindle? No problem! You can use many devices to read Kindle 
e-books, as you discover in Chapter 4.
The borrower can return the loaned e-book before the 14-day loan 
is over. If you’re reading a borrowed book and want to return it, go 
to the Your Kindle Library section of the Manage Your Kindle page 
on Amazon. Click the plus symbol (+) next to the loaned title and 
then click the Delete This Title link.
	
While an e-book from your Kindle is on loan, you can’t read it. Also, 
you can loan a book only one time. A letter will be sent to your 
personal documents to remind you that the book is on loan and 
the annotation On Loan will appear next to the book in Your Kindle 
Library.
Currently, only e-book customers residing in the United States can 
loan Kindle e-books. Loans can be made to people living outside 
the United States, but the borrower may not be able to accept the 
loan, depending on geographic differences in publishing rights.
	
You can join Kindle community forums to participate in exchanges 
in which Kindle owners lend and borrow e-books. A popular forum 
is the Lend and Borrow Exchange link at www.kboards.com.

 Chapter 6: Loaning, Borrowing, and Gifting 87
	
Want to know whether a book can be loaned before you purchase 
it? From a personal computer, view the book’s product page on 
Amazon. Scroll down to the Product Details section and look for 
Lending: Enabled.
Lending versus sharing
When you purchase Kindle e-books from Amazon, they’re associated with your 
Amazon account. If you have more than one Kindle device or app registered to your 
account, content can be shared among the devices, but it can’t be shared with a 
device or an app registered to another account. Sharing refers specifically to shar­
ing books among devices registered to a single Amazon account.
Although you might not mind having multiple devices on your account, keep in mind 
that those other devices — and their users — have access to your account to buy 
content using the credit card associated with the account. Even though devices 
on the same account can be shared, publishers may limit how many times you can 
download a copy simultaneously to different devices or apps. Books do not have 
unlimited sharing privileges.
Some Kindle e-books can be loaned to devices not registered to your account. In 
general, e-books that can be loaned to another Kindle owner on a different account 
can be lent only once, for a period of two weeks. While the e-book is on loan, it isn’t 
available to you.
Current subscription content, such as an e-magazine or an e-newspaper, is limited 
to one Kindle at a time. For example, two people can’t share a daily subscription to 
the New York Times and read the current day’s paper at the same time on two dif­
ferent devices. Past issues can be downloaded to compatible devices on the same 
account. Subscription content cannot be loaned across accounts.
If you give a used Kindle as a gift, the content you purchased can’t be given as 
a gift. The device must be deregistered and the previous content erased. You 
can deregister a Kindle Paperwhite on the device itself (in the Settings sec­
tion) or from the Manage Your Devices section of your Amazon account. Follow 
the same steps as you did to register your Kindle Paperwhite in Chapter 2. (The 
options will change to deregister instead.) You can delete content by tapping 
Menu➪Settings➪Menu➪Reset Device.
Read the License Agreement and Terms of Use at the Kindle Store. This document 
governs the use of e-books and digital content you download from Amazon. It can 
be found at www.amazon.com/kindlelicense.

Borrowing Books from the Library
Many public libraries allow Kindle e-books to be checked out. How 
does this work? The e-book is made available to you for a fixed 
amount of time — the loan period varies by library. When the loan 
expires, the e-book is no longer available to you, unless you check 
it out again or purchase it from Amazon’s Kindle Store.
You can make highlights, add notes, and include bookmarks in a 
borrowed library e-book. Those annotations are preserved even 
after the e-book loan expires, in case you later decide to purchase 
the e-book or borrow it again.
To borrow an e-book, go to your local public library’s website. If 
your library supports OverDrive digital e-book services, you can 
check out Kindle-compatible e-books. Note that you must use your 
library card and have online borrowing privileges. And, just as with 
paper books, all available copies of an e-book may be checked out. 
Most libraries will allow you to reserve an e-book or put it on hold.
Public library e-books for Kindle e-readers are presently available 
only in the United States.
	
From your library’s website, you can have the e-book delivered 
wirelessly to your Kindle or Kindle app through Wi-Fi. (They aren’t 
distributed over a 3G connection.) Note that some publishers allow 
books to be transferred to your Kindle Paperwhite only by using 
the USB cable. These books also cannot be read on other devices 
such as an iPhone or a PC (using the Kindle app).
Borrowing Books from the Kindle 
Owners’ Lending Library
If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you have access to the Kindle 
Owners’ Lending Library. Amazon Prime is a $79-a-year subscrip­
tion program that provides a number of benefits to subscribers, 
including free shipping on Prime-eligible products; access to the 
Prime video library; and for Kindle owners, the opportunity to 
borrow books from the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library.
At the time of this writing, close to 440,000 books were available, 
covering topics from fiction, to humor, to travel. For an overview, 
use your device to go to the Kindle Store and open the drop-down 
menu for All Categories. The Kindle Owners’ Lending Library is the 
last item on the list.

 Chapter 6: Loaning, Borrowing, and Gifting 89
After you select Kindle Owners’ Lending Library, a screen appears list­
ing all the books available in various categories, such as Nonfiction, 
Travel, and History. Tap on a topic of interest to see specific books, 
and then select a book that appeals to you. Figure 6-2 shows a book 
available for loan from the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library.
Figure 6-2: You can borrow books for free.
Read the book’s description and reviews. If you find a book that 
intrigues you, simply tap the Borrow for Free icon to download the 
book immediately to your Kindle Paperwhite. When you borrow a 
book, you’ll see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 6-3.
	
You can borrow one book per month. You can’t borrow a new book 
until you return the previously borrowed book. If you aren’t eligible 
to borrow a book (that is, you’ve reached your monthly quota), the 
option to Borrow for Free appears dimmed at the Kindle Store.
If you have a borrowed book on your Kindle Paperwhite, you’ll be 
asked to return the book before you can borrow another, as shown 
in Figure 6-4. Although you can borrow only one book per month, 
you can keep a book on your device for as long as you want — but 
you won’t be able to borrow a second book until you return the 
first one.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Figure 6-4: You must return a borrowed book before borrowing another.
	
Although you can use your computer to browse the Kindle Store 
and see books that are available for borrowing, you have to use your 
Kindle Paperwhite to borrow a book. You can’t send a borrowed 
book to your Kindle Paperwhite from your computer.
	
If you maintain a Wish List at Amazon, you can access it from your 
Kindle Paperwhite and see which books on your list are available 
for free borrowing. Tap Settings, and then swipe the list to see 
additional options. Your Wish List will be at the top of the list. Tap 
it, and then Tap Kindle Wish List. Books that are available in the 
Kindle Owners’ Lending Library will appear with the Prime logo.

You can also rent Kindle textbooks, which is a great option for 
students. See Chapter 9 for details.
Gifting Books
You can give anyone an e-book from the book’s product page on 
Amazon. A Give as a Gift button is available for most e-books in the 
Kindle Store.
You can e-mail the gift directly to someone or specify when the 
e-mail should be sent. Recipients receive a link in the e-mail that 
enables them to access the e-book.
Alternatively, you can have the e-mail sent to you. Perhaps you’d 
like to forward the e-mail later to the giftee or you want to print the 
e-mail and present the gift that way.
If the recipient already owns the book you have selected, he or she 
can use the gift certificate toward the purchase of a different book.
	
Many online e-booksellers also let you give an e-book as a gift. 
Details on how to do so are available at the seller’s website. I list 
some popular e-booksellers in Chapter 5.

fter you’ve had your Kindle Paperwhite for a while, you’re 
sure to have downloaded e-books from the Kindle Store or 
from other online sources. But what if you want to read some of 
your own content on your Kindle Paperwhite? Most people have 
a massive collection of materials from work or school on their 
computers: reference manuals, lists, maps, correspondence, 
creative writing, and other personal documents. Wouldn’t it 
be nice to have some of that content available on your Kindle 
Paperwhite as you travel or go about your daily life?
Or what if you’re surfing the web and you see an interesting article 
or blog post and think to yourself, “I’d like to put that on my Kindle 
Paperwhite to read later.” Guess what? You can! Amazon and the 
Kindle Paperwhite have some new tools to allow you to do this 
quickly and easily.
In this chapter, you explore how to put your own documents 
onto your Kindle Paperwhite. You also find out how to create 
documents that you might acquire from other sources. Then 
you discover some handy services and tools to send compatible 
files to your Kindle Paperwhite and to convert documents so that 
they’re readable on your device.

Transferring Kindle-Friendly 
File Formats
Your Kindle Paperwhite can’t read every file that’s on your 
computer. A file has to be in a Kindle-compatible format so 
that the device can display it. The following list describes the 
Kindle-friendly file types:
	
✓	AZW is the Kindle format, so most files you download from 
the Kindle Store will have an AZW extension. Note that some 
files might have a number, such as 1, 2, or 3, after the AZW.
	
✓	MOBI, a file format developed by Mobipocket, is widely used 
and compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite. Note, however, 
that secure Mobipocket or secure MOBI files do not work on a 
Kindle Paperwhite.
	
✓	PRC is equivalent to MOBI and is the standard file format for 
the Kindle family of e-readers for content that comes from 
sources other than Amazon.com.
	
✓	TXT is a simple text file, such as one you might create with 
Notepad.
	
✓	PDF: Your Kindle Paperwhite can display files in Adobe’s 
Portable Document Format (PDF).
Files in these formats are generally readable natively — that is, 
without needing to be converted — by your Kindle Paperwhite. So 
all you have to do is transfer the files onto your Kindle Paperwhite, 
as I describe in the next section.
	
If you use Windows Explorer or Finder on a Mac, you may see files 
with the POBI extension on your Kindle Paperwhite. Curious about 
these? Do you have any periodicals (newspapers or magazines) on 
your device? If so, they’ll have the POBI extension. POBI is a varia­
tion of MOBI and enables the display of articles and sections in 
periodical content. To learn more about navigating in a periodical, 
see Chapter 4.
Copying Files from Your Computer
If your file is in one of the Kindle-compatible formats listed in the 
preceding section, you can transfer it directly from your computer 
to your Kindle Paperwhite via USB.

 Chapter 7: Adding Documents 95
To transfer the files, follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Kindle Paperwhite to your computer using 
the USB cable.
	
	 Your computer recognizes your Kindle Paperwhite when 
it’s plugged in and displays the Kindle Paperwhite as a 
removable drive, as shown in Figure 7-1. If you go to My 
Computer (PC) or Finder (Mac), your Kindle Paperwhite 
appears as a drive.

Figure 7-1: Your Kindle Paperwhite appears as a removable hard drive when 
connected to your computer.
	
2.	Double-click the drive to open it and view the folders on 
your Kindle Paperwhite.
	
3.	Open another window and navigate to the file(s) you 
want to transfer to your Kindle Paperwhite.
	
4.	Drag the file(s) to the Documents folder on your Kindle 
Paperwhite.
	
	 You can also use the Copy and Paste commands to move 
documents to the Documents folder.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
96
	
5.	Eject your Kindle Paperwhite from your computer:
 
• On a Windows 8 PC: Right-click the Kindle drive icon 
and choose Eject. A notification that it is safe to remove 
the device from the computer appears.
 
• On a Windows Vista or Windows 7 PC: Choose 
Start➪Computer, and then right-click the Kindle drive 
icon and choose Eject. You can also left- or right-click 
the Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media icon in the 
lower-right corner of the taskbar.
 
• On a Mac: Control-click the Kindle device icon and 
choose Eject.
	
	 The files you transferred are displayed on your Home 
screen and are available for you to view on your Kindle 
Paperwhite.
	
If files are protected with DRM, your Kindle Paperwhite cannot 
read them and you’ll see an error message when you try to 
open the e-book. Before buying books from sources other than 
Amazon, make sure that the file is compatible with your Kindle 
Paperwhite.
	
Sideloading describes the transfer of files directly from one device 
to another. Uploading and downloading are terms that are com­
monly used to describe transferring files to or from an Internet 
server. What I describe here is sideloading.
Transferring Files Using 
Send to Kindle
If you have a document in a format that is not native to the Kindle 
Paperwhite (as described in the preceding section), you can send 
it to your device using the Send to Kindle application. The docu­
ment will be converted to a compatible format and displayed on 
the Home screen of your Kindle Paperwhite.
To begin, go to the Send to Kindle home page at www.amazon.
com/gp/sendtokindle. You’ll see options for sending docu­
ments to your Kindle Paperwhite from your desktop, browser, 
Android device, and e-mail.
Sending from the desktop
In the From Your Desktop section of the Send to Kindle home page, 
click the appropriate link for your computer: PC or Mac. You see 

 Chapter 7: Adding Documents 97
instructions on how the Send to Kindle program works and the 
system requirements for your computer.
Agree to the terms of service, and click Download Now to begin 
the download and installation process. Figure 7-2 shows the screen 
that appears when the program has been successfully installed.
Figure 7-2: Successful installation of Send to Kindle for PC.
After the program is installed, you can access it in a variety of 
ways. Here are a few examples:
	
1.	Do one of the following:
 
• Word processing, spreadsheets, and other productivity 
applications: Choose Print.
 
• Windows Explorer (PC): Right-click to select a document. 
To select multiple documents, use Control-Click or 
Shift-Click.
 
• Finder (Mac): Control-click to select one or more 
documents.
	
2.	Choose Send to Kindle as your printer, and then choose 
Print.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
98
	
3. In the dialog box that appears:
	
a.	Insert a title and an author.
	
b.	Choose the devices to which you want to send the 
document.
	
	You can also choose to have the document archived 
in your Kindle Library, which means you’ll be able 
to download it from the Cloud later to any of your 
Kindles.
	
c.	Decide whether to use Wi-Fi delivery, which is free, 
or Whispernet, which may incur a charge.
	
	See the last section, “Paying Fees for Transferring 
Documents,” for details.
	
4.	Choose Send.
	
	 The document will be converted to PDF format and 
delivered to your Kindle Paperwhite.
	
Wireless must be turned on for your Kindle Paperwhite to receive 
documents.
	
If you do not see Send to Kindle on the pop-up menu that appears, 
you are probably trying to send a file in a format that is not com­
patible with your Kindle Paperwhite and cannot be converted to a 
PDF through the Send to Kindle process.
Sending from a browser
If you use Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as your browser, you 
can download a nifty little app that lets you send news articles, 
blog posts, or any other content that grabs your eye to your Kindle 
Paperwhite. On the Send to Kindle page, click the link for either 
Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox in the From Your Browser area.
Follow the instructions for downloading the app. When the app 
is installed, you see a small K at the top right of the screen. When 
you click the K button in the browser, the dialog box shown in 
Figure 7-3 appears.
You can send directly to your Kindle Paperwhite, preview before 
sending, or send selected text. After you make your choice, the 
content will be formatted and will appear on the Home screen of 
your Kindle Paperwhite in a few minutes — as long as wireless is 
turned on.

 Chapter 7: Adding Documents 99
Figure 7-3: Send to Kindle in Google Chrome.
Sending from an Android device
If you have an Android device, you can send documents to your 
Kindle Paperwhite using the Send to Kindle for Android app. On the 
Send to Kindle page, click the link in the From Your Android device 
area to download the application and follow the instructions.
Then you can use the Share feature found in many apps to send 
documents to your Kindle Paperwhite. Supported file types include 
Microsoft Word (DOC, DOCX); PDF; images (JPG, JPEG, GIF, PNG, 
BMP); and Kindle format (MOBI, AZW).
Sending from E-Mail
The Send to Kindle application certainly makes converting and 
transferring documents quick and easy. However, e-mail is a 
reliable standby to use for file transfer.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
100
	
You can use e-mail also when you don’t want to sideload content 
onto your Kindle Paperwhite with the USB cable.
File types that can be transferred 
through e-mail
You can send the following types of files to your Kindle Paperwhite 
using the unique e-mail address for your device. Note that these 
files must be unprotected (that is, not protected by DRM) to be 
readable on your Kindle Paperwhite:
	
✓	Microsoft Word (DOC or DOCX)
	
✓	PDF (PDF)
	
✓	HyperText Markup Language (HTML, HTM)
	
✓	Plain text (TXT)
	
✓	Rich text (RTF)
	
✓	Kindle format (MOBI, AZW)
	
✓	Graphics (JPG, GIF, PNG, or BMP)
Utilizing the Kindle Paperwhite 
e-mail address
To convert your personal documents so you can read them on 
your Kindle Paperwhite, send them to the e-mail address asso­
ciated with your Kindle Paperwhite: yourname@kindle.com, 
where yourname is the unique name identified with your Kindle 
Paperwhite. This e-mail address was created automatically when 
you registered your Kindle Paperwhite. You can change the e-mail 
address, if you want; the steps to do so are described shortly.
Discovering your Paperwhite’s e-mail address
To find out what your Kindle Paperwhite’s e-mail address is, follow 
these steps:
	
	
1.	 Tap Menu➪Settings.
	
2.	Tap Device Options➪Personalize Your Kindle.
	
	 The Personalize Your Kindle screen appears. Send-to-Kindle 
E-Mail, the fourth item in the list, displays the e-mail 
associated with your Kindle Paperwhite.

 Chapter 7: Adding Documents 101
Changing your Paperwhite’s e-mail address
To change your Kindle Paperwhite’s e-mail address, you must do 
so from your Amazon account on your computer. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Go to www.amazon.com/myk.
	
2.	If prompted, enter your e-mail address and password.
	
3.	Click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
	
4.	From the left menu, under Your Kindle Account, choose 
Personal Document Settings.
	
	 Your Kindle Paperwhite and its associated e-mail address 
appear.
	
5.	Click Edit and input a new address.
	
	 If you create an e-mail address that is already in use, you’ll 
be prompted to modify it or create another.
	
6.	Click the Update button to save.
To send an e-mail to your Kindle Paperwhite, you need to approve 
your own e-mail address and any others that might send content to 
your device. This can be accomplished only through your Amazon 
account, not from the Kindle Paperwhite.
Approving an e-mail address
Amazon adds a level of security to the e-mail transfer process by 
limiting which e-mail addresses can be used to send documents 
to your @kindle.com e-mail address. This prevents unauthorized 
users from sending documents to your Kindle Paperwhite and 
potentially running up document transfer charges.
You manage this approved e-mail list from the Manage Your Kindle 
page. To approve an e-mail address so it can send content to your 
Kindle Paperwhite, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to www.amazon.com/myk.
	
2.	If prompted, enter your e-mail address and password.
	
3.	Click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
	
4.	From the left menu, under Your Kindle Account, choose 
Personal Document Settings.
	
	 The list of approved e-mail addresses is in the center of the 
screen under the heading, Approved Personal Document 
E-Mail List. If you have not previously approved any e-mail 
addresses, the list will be blank.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
102
	
5.	Click Add a New Approved E-Mail Address.
	
6.	Enter the e-mail address you want to approve, and then 
click Add Address.
	
7. To add and approve additional e-mail addresses, repeat 
Step 6.
	
	 The approved addresses are listed in the table in the center 
of the screen, with the option to delete them on the right 
(if you later choose to do so).
Make sure to include your own e-mail address (or addresses, if 
you have multiple e-mail accounts from which you might be 
sending documents to your Kindle Paperwhite) so that you can 
send documents to your device.
	
Many e-book retailers allow you to set up your account so that 
purchases you make are e-mailed automatically to your Kindle 
Paperwhite. In essence, this mimics the wireless delivery service 
that Amazon offers. If you want to take advantage of this, make 
sure to add the e-mail address of the e-bookseller to your approved 
list of e-mail addresses.
	
If you want to allow documents to be sent from anyone from a 
particular domain, don’t include a username. For example, adding 
@mycompany.com authorizes anyone with an e-mail address 
matching that domain name to send documents to your Kindle 
Paperwhite. However, you are responsible for any charges for 
documents sent from those e-mail addresses via Whispernet to 
your Kindle Paperwhite. Transferring files via Wi-Fi is free. If you 
set the maximum charge for Whispernet Delivery over 3G to $0, 
personal documents will be sent only via Wi-Fi even if you have 3G. 
You can make this change in the Personal Documents Settings.
More options for converting documents
If you want to read a file on your Kindle Paperwhite that’s in an unsupported file 
type, you can install software on your computer that can read different file types 
and then convert those files to Kindle-compatible formats. One such option is cali­
bre (www.calibre-ebook.com), which is available for PC or Mac. The calibre 
program can convert e-books in a host of formats — including CBZ, CBR, CBC, 
CHM, EPUB, FB2, HTML, LIT, LRF, MOBI, ODT, PDF, PRC, PDB, PML, RB, RTF, SNB, 
TCR, and TXT — to various other formats, including the Kindle-compatible MOBI 
format.

 Chapter 7: Adding Documents 103
Sending the files
When you know your Kindle Paperwhite’s e-mail address and 
you’ve added your personal e-mail address to the Approved 
Personal Document E-Mail List (see the preceding section), 
transferring files is simple:
	
1.	Open your e-mail program or your e-mail web page. Log 
on to your account, if necessary.
	
2. Create a new message. In the To text box, enter the e-mail 
address of your Kindle Paperwhite.
	
3.	Attach the document you want to transfer to your Kindle 
Paperwhite.
	
	 There’s no need to specify a subject or to provide text in 
the body of the message. Amazon recommends that each 
personal document be no larger than 50MB.
	
4.	Click Send.
	
	 If you’re connected in a Wi-Fi area (or with 3G for Kindle 
Paperwhites so enabled), you receive the converted file on 
your Kindle Paperwhite in about five minutes. Very large 
files can take longer to convert and receive.
	 When you send personal documents to your Kindle Paperwhite, 
they’re stored automatically in your Kindle Library at Amazon. You 
can store up to 5 gigabytes of personal documents in the archive.
If you’re sending a PDF file and would like to take advantage of 
features on the Kindle Paperwhite, such as changing font size and 
making notes, convert the file to Kindle format (AZW) by typing 
CONVERT in the subject line of your message.
Reading PDF Documents
Some of the personal documents that you load on your Kindle 
Paperwhite may be PDF documents. The Kindle Paperwhite can 
read PDF documents natively — in other words, without converting 
them.
The Kindle Paperwhite handles PDF documents differently from 
how it handles text in the usual Kindle format:
	
✓	PDF documents are displayed with the text and graphics 
laid out exactly as in the original PDF document. You can’t 
change the layout, font size, typeface, line spacing, and words 
per line.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
104
	
✓	You can zoom in on a PDF document by unpinching (placing 
two fingers on the screen and moving your fingers apart). 
Note that this is different than increasing the font size. The 
text doesn’t reflow; instead, you see an enlarged view of a 
section of the screen. You can then pan around the screen 
by sliding your finger on the display. To zoom out, pinch the 
screen (move two fingers together). You can’t turn the page 
while zooming in.
	
	
	You can adjust the contrast of the displayed document by 
tapping the Menu icon.
	
✓	At the bottom of the screen, your Kindle Paperwhite displays 
the original PDF document’s page numbers.
Why would you want to read a document in PDF format? Many PDF 
documents are highly formatted with columns, tables, and figures 
that do not convert well to Kindle Paperwhite format. Although 
you lose the ability to make notes and marks in a PDF, you are able 
to read the document as originally presented.
	
The Kindle Paperwhite does not support reading PDFs in 
Landscape mode.
Do you want to use Kindle Paperwhite features such as changing 
font size and making notes? When e-mailing the PDF file, simply 
convert the file to Kindle format (AZW) by typing CONVERT in the 
subject line of your message. If you do this, look carefully at the 
formatting of the PDF to make sure that a converted file is going to 
be acceptable to you for reading.
Paying Fees for Transferring 
Documents
If you have a Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite, all your documents 
will be delivered by Wi-Fi without charge. If you’re in an area where 
Wi-Fi is not available, your documents will be queued and 
delivered when Wi-Fi is available.
If you have a 3G device and Wi-FI is not available, the document 
can be delivered using Whispernet — that is, over a 3G network. 
Amazon does not charge a monthly fee for 3G, but you do incur 
a charge for receiving documents this way. At present, the fee is 
$.15 per megabyte for customers in the United States and $.99 per 
megabyte when traveling outside the United States and for Kindle 
users living outside the United States.

 Chapter 7: Adding Documents 105
Wireless file transfer isn’t available in all countries. For the latest 
availability information, go to www.amazon.com/myk, log in if 
necessary, and click the Kindle Support link. Scroll down to the 
Wireless Delivery section. Even if wireless file transfer isn’t 
available, you can still use the Kindle e-mail conversion service 
and then transfer the converted files to your Kindle Paperwhite 
via USB.
	
You can set a limit on the charges allowed for personal docu­
ments to be transferred. Go to the Manage Your Kindle page (www.
amazon.com/myk), and click the Personal Document Settings link 
in the left column. Scroll down to the middle of the page to the 
section headed Whispernet Delivery Option. Choose Edit (on the 
right) to change the maximum amount that you will be charged 
(from $0 to $49.50 with a default of $2.50). If you try to convert 
a document that exceeds that charge, it won’t be delivered and 
you’ll be notified by e-mail. Some Kindle Paperwhite users set the 
limit at $0 to ensure that all personal documents are transferred 
via Wi-Fi and thus incur no charges.

and X-ray

▶	Listening and reading with Whispersync for Voice
▶	Browsing the web with your Kindle Paperwhite
A

lthough the Kindle Paperwhite is first and foremost a reading 
device, it does offer several features that go beyond reading. 
You can look up words with the dictionary and memorize their 
definitions with Vocabulary Builder, make notes, highlight text, 
translate words from English to other languages and vice versa, dig 
deeper with the X-ray feature, browse the web, and post comments 
and interesting quotes on Goodreads, Facebook, and Twitter.
In this chapter, I look at these features — and go beyond reading 
with your Kindle Paperwhite!
Easy Dictionary Look-Up
One of the most useful Kindle Paperwhite features is the built-in 
dictionary. The dictionary is easy to access and makes it swift and 
painless to find the definition of an unknown word.
To display a dictionary definition of a word, long-tap (that is, tap 
and hold down on) a word. The selected word is highlighted as 
white text on a black background. When you release your finger, 
a dictionary definition for the word appears onscreen in a pop-up 
box, as shown in Figure 8-1. To clear the definition, tap anywhere 
outside the pop-up box.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
108
Figure 8-1: Displaying the definition of the word counterfeiter.
	
	 In the definition box, note two additional tabs: X-Ray and 
Wikipedia. Tap X-Ray to display additional information about the 
selected word. Likewise, if your device is not in Airplane mode, you 
can tap Wikipedia to open a Wikipedia page with information about 
your selected word. Note that the information provided by the 
three resources may be similar. I dig a little deeper into the X-ray 
feature later in the chapter.
	
X-Ray is not active in all books nor is it active for all words. When 
this is the case, the option will appear dimmed.
At the bottom of the definition box are two additional choices: 
Search and More. Tap Search to display the menu shown in 
Figure 8-2. You have three choices: This Book searches for the 
word in the current book, All Text searches for the word on your 
Kindle Paperwhite, and Kindle Store finds all titles that have the 
word — it doesn’t search for every instance of the word in the 
Kindle Store! Results of the search for Bombay returned 315 hits 
for the book; 3 hits on my Kindle (which includes the present book 
with 315 instances of the word); and 176 titles in the Kindle Store.

The definition box also includes a More button. Tap that button to 
display the screen as shown in Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-3: Options when you tap More in a dictionary definition.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
110
You have the following options:
	
✓	Highlight: Highlight the word on the screen. Note that once 
the word is highlighted, the choice on the More Options menu 
changes to Delete. This option deletes the highlighting, not 
the word.
	
✓	Add Note: Add a note regarding the word. When you return 
to the book, word is highlighted with a superscripted number. 
Tap the number to read your note. To close the note, tap the X 
in the upper-right corner.
	
✓	Share: Share the word (and any commentary) on Goodreads 
and, if you want, Facebook and Twitter. Let your friends know 
how smart you are! (Social sharing is discussed in more detail 
in an upcoming section.)
	
✓	Translation: Translate the word from English to one of 16 
other languages, including Chinese, Hindi, and Norwegian. 
You can also translate from other languages to English. The 
Kindle Paperwhite will even determine the source language 
for you. Figure 8-4 shows the translation of the word paix from 
French to English.
	
✓	Open Dictionary: Open the default dictionary at the definition 
of the word. In this way, you can read a more detailed defini­
tion or navigate quickly to linked entries. To return to your 
book, tap the Back icon. You may need to tap it several times, 
depending on how much exploring you did in the dictionary.
	
✓	Report Content Error: Report errors, such as typos, format­
ting, or other problems, directly to Amazon. Is a word mis­
spelled or is incorrect punctuation used? Here’s your chance 
to report it. Amazon has made a concerted effort to have pub­
lishers correct errors in their Kindle editions so that readers 
receive the highest quality books available.
	
The Kindle Paperwhite has two dictionaries: the default New 
Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (both 
from Oxford University Press). You can change the default 
dictionary as follows:
	
	
1.	 Tap Menu➪Settings.
	
2.	Tap Device Options➪Language and 
Dictionaries➪Dictionaries.
	
	 The active dictionary appears.
	
3.	Tap the active dictionary to change to a different dictionary.
	
	 A list of available dictionaries stored on the device appears.

 Chapter 8: Expanding the Reading Experience 111
	
4.	Change the default dictionary by tapping the radio 
button on the right.
The radio button that is darkened (filled in) indicates 
which dictionary is selected as the default.
Figure 8-4: Translation of a word from French to English.
	
Stored in your Kindle Library at your Amazon account are sev­
eral foreign language dictionaries, including Spanish, French, and 
Portuguese. Go to www.amazon.com/myk to access your library. 
Any (or all) of these dictionaries can be delivered to your Kindle 
Paperwhite. If you change the language on your device, the corre­
sponding language dictionary becomes the default. Note that you 
won’t see the dictionaries if you look in the Cloud on your 
Kindle Paperwhite; you have to go to your Kindle Library using 
your computer.
Vocabulary Builder
By default, every word you look up in the dictionary is added to 
a list that you can access using Vocabulary Builder. From any 
book, tap Menu — Vocabulary Builder. The screen shown in 

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
112
Figure 8-5 appears, listing the words you’ve looked up. Tap a word 
to see its definition. On the menu that appears, you can tap the 
Usage tab to see how the word was used in the book.
Figure 8-5: Word list in Vocabulary Builder.
To change the view from a list of words to the list of books in 
which you’ve searched for words, tap Books at the top of the 
screen. The screen shown in Figure 8-6 appears. Tap the arrow 
to the right of a book’s title to see all the words you researched 
in that book. You can then tap a word to see its definition and its 
usage in the book.
Your Kindle Paperwhite includes a Flashcards feature to help 
you learn the words on your vocabulary list. At the bottom of 
Figure 8-6, tap Flashcards to display a screen like the one shown in 
Figure 8-7. Use the arrows or swipe to page forward and backward 
through the list. Each flashcard shows the word in context in the 
book you were reading — if you can’t remember the definition, tap 
See Definition to refresh your memory. When you’ve learned the 
word, tap Mark as Mastered to remove it from the active list. Tap 
Exit Flashcards in the upper left to return to the active word list.

You can also mark a word as Mastered from the Dictionary 
definition screen.
Vocabulary Builder appears on your Home screen in your list of 
books. Tap Vocabulary Builder to open it, just as you would a 
book. You can access Vocabulary Builder (after you’ve activated it 
the first time) also from the menu. If your list on the Home screen 
is sorted by Recent and Vocabulary Builder is the most recent item 
you’ve viewed, it will be at the top of the list. If your Home screen 
is sorted by Collections, Vocabulary Builder will be the first item in 
the list after the listing of collections.
	
Kindle Free Time, which is discussed in Chapter 9, works the same 
way after it has been activated, as does the My Clippings folder.
As noted, Vocabulary Builder is turned on by default. To turn it off, 
tap Menu➪Settings➪Reading Options. Switch the toggle to Off. Now 
Vocabulary Builder will not appear on your Home screen and the 
menu option for Vocabulary Builder will appear dimmed. Any words 
you look up in the dictionary will not be added to your vocabulary 
list, but any words you’ve looked up previously will be retained.
Utilizing Highlights and Notes
As you’re reading, you may want to highlight text to refer to later 
or to add your own notes to a particular passage. You may even 
want to make a Facebook post or Twitter tweet that includes an 
excerpt from the e-book. The touchscreen makes it particularly 
convenient for you to make these marks, or annotations:
	
✓	Highlights shade a section of text to draw attention to it.
	
✓	Notes are text you type, much like when you jot notes in the 
margins of a printed book.
These annotations are stored on your Kindle Paperwhite and 
are backed up at Amazon — as long as the annotations backup 
feature is turned on. To check whether this is the case, tap 
Menu➪Settings➪Reading Options➪Notes & Highlights. Make sure the 
toggle switch next to Annotations Backup is set to On. This setting 
enables you to recover your notes if you lose your Kindle Paperwhite 
or upgrade to another model. If you borrow a book from the Kindle 
Owners’ Lending Library or rent a textbook, your annotations are 
preserved, even when you return the book. See Chapter 6 to find out 
more about the library and Chapter 9 for information on renting texts.
To make an annotation, select text in your book by touching your 
finger to a word and dragging your finger across the screen. As you 
do so, the selected text turns white on a black background.

 Chapter 8: Expanding the Reading Experience 115
When you release your finger, a pop-up window provides these 
options: Add Note, Highlight, Share, and More. In the following 
sections, I look at each option.
	
Annotating is disabled in book samples. You can’t add notes, high­
lights, or bookmarks or share excerpts when viewing a book sample.
Highlighting text
With the desired text selected (see the preceding section), tap the 
Highlight button. The text is highlighted in the book — appearing 
as black text on a gray background.
To delete a highlight, select any of the highlighted words by touch­
ing and dragging across them or by long-tapping. A Delete button 
appears in a pop-up window; tap Delete to remove the highlight.
	
What if the text you want to highlight spans more than one page? 
Just tap at the beginning and keep dragging to the next page. The 
text will continue to be highlighted. If you want to see everything 
on one page, adjust the font size to get all your desired text on the 
screen. Or you can adjust the starting point of the displayed text 
by changing the location. Touch the top of the screen to display the 
toolbar, and then tap Menu➪Go To➪Page or Location. Enter a loca­
tion slightly different than the current location to shift the starting 
point of the displayed text, until all your desired text is displayed.
An interesting thing about highlights is that you can view highlights 
that other readers have made. Amazon collects this information 
and highlights passages in your book that have been highlighted 
frequently by other readers. Your Kindle Paperwhite displays how 
many people have highlighted that particular passage.
Although this can be intriguing, some readers find the display of 
popular highlights distracting. To turn off these popular highlights, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap Menu➪Settings➪Reading Options➪Notes & 
Highlights.
	
	 Popular Highlights is one of the Reading Options listed.
	
2.	Tap the On/Off toggle to deactivate the Popular 
Highlights option.
	
If you don’t want to share your highlighted passages with Amazon, 
turn off the Annotations Backup option in the Reading Options 
page under Settings. If you do this, your annotations aren’t backed 
up by Amazon, and they won’t appear on other devices registered 
to your Amazon account.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
116
Taking notes
Want to make margin notes in your books? You can with your 
Kindle Paperwhite. Adding notes is similar to highlighting text.
With the desired text selected, as I describe in the “Utilizing 
Highlights and Notes” section, earlier in this chapter, tap the Add 
Note button. A pop-up window appears with a text entry block and 
the onscreen keyboard. Type your notes using the keyboard and 
then tap Save.
Note that the text associated with your note is now highlighted in 
your book and is followed by a superscripted number. Tapping that 
number displays your note’s text block — where you can edit or 
delete it.
You can view notes that other readers have made by turning on the 
Public Notes feature. Tap Menu➪Settings➪Reading Options➪Notes 
& Highlights, and then turn on the toggle for Public Notes. See 
https://kindle.amazon.com/faq for more on public notes.
Viewing annotations
You can view all your notes, highlights, and bookmarks for a partic­
ular book. Tap Go To, and select the Notes tab from the menu that 
appears. Your notes, your highlights, and the popular and public 
highlights for that e-book are displayed.
You can also access your notes from a book by tapping the super­
scripted number, which opens that particular note. At the bottom 
of the note block, tap View Notes to display the same screen you 
accessed by using Go To. (The other options enable you to edit 
your note and, by tapping More, to delete or share the note.) To 
exit this screen, tap the X in the upper-right corner.
	
You can also view all your annotations across all your books, maga­
zines, newspapers, and personal documents. Kindle Paperwhite 
places these in a My Clippings file that’s available as a document 
from your Home screen. You can read your My Clippings file just as 
you would any other document on your Kindle Paperwhite.
You can view your annotations from a personal computer by going 
to http://kindle.amazon.com (United States and other 
countries) or http://kindle.amazon.co.uk (United Kingdom). 
Sign in and click the Your Highlights link.

 Chapter 8: Expanding the Reading Experience 117
Sharing notes and passages 
of interest
You probably noticed that when creating or viewing highlights 
and notes in your book, a Share button is available. This button 
lets you share a note and a link to the selected passage through 
Goodreads. If you’ve linked your Goodreads account to Facebook 
and Twitter, your notes will be shared on those sites, too. You 
can do all this directly from your Kindle Paperwhite — no com­
puter required! The Share button is an easy way to let others 
know about books you’re enjoying or passages you found 
interesting.
When you use your Kindle Paperwhite to share on Twitter, your 
tweet consists of your short note plus a Goodreads link to a list 
of quotes for the book you’re reading. Figure 8-8 shows a sample 
tweet created on a Kindle Paperwhite.
Figure 8-8: Tweet a quote of interest from your Kindle Paperwhite.
From your Kindle Paperwhite, you can also update your Facebook 
status. An image of the book cover or a picture of the author 
(whatever is embedded in the book), an excerpt of highlighted text 
that you’ve selected, a note that you’ve written, and a link to the 
quote on Goodreads will be posted. Figure 8-9 shows a Facebook 
status update created from a Kindle Paperwhite.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Figure 8-9: A Facebook status update with a link to the book.
To take advantage of these features, you need to link your Kindle 
Paperwhite to Goodreads. Then you add Facebook and Twitter.
	
	 To begin tap the G (for Goodreads) icon on the toolbar. The screen 
shown in Figure 8-10 appears.
Figure 8-10: The screen you see when you select Goodreads for the first time.
If you already have a Goodreads account, tap Connect Existing 
Account. You can use your Facebook account, if you have one con­
nected to Goodreads, or simply use your Goodreads credentials, as 
shown in Figure 8-11.

 Chapter 8: Expanding the Reading Experience 119
Figure 8-11: Connect using your Facebook account or Goodreads credentials.
If you don’t have an existing account, tap Create New Account (refer 
to Figure 8-10). The screen shown in Figure 8-12 appears, asking you 
to create a Goodreads account with your Amazon credentials.
When you create your Goodreads account, you see screens that 
enable you to link to Facebook and Twitter. You can also make 
these connections later. To link or make changes to your Facebook 
account, you must go to Goodreads.com on your computer. To link 
to Twitter, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap Menu➪Settings➪Reading Options.
	
2.	Tap Social Networks. (If wireless is off, you’re prompted 
to turn it on.)
	
3.	Tap the Link Account button for Twitter.
	
4.	Enter your Twitter e-mail address and your Twitter 
password on the authorization screen that appears.
After your Kindle Paperwhite is linked, you can share a note about 
what you’re reading by following these steps:
	
1.	From within a book, select text by tapping and holding 
down on a word, and then slide your finger across the page.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
120
	
2.	Tap the Share button.
	
3.	Enter your message in the text box that appears.
	
4.	Tap Share.
Your note and a link to the selected book passage posts to the 
accounts you’ve linked to your Kindle Paperwhite (Goodreads, 
Twitter, Facebook). All comments will be shared to Goodreads. You 
have the option of sharing to Twitter and Facebook by tapping to 
select (or deselect) the box in front of the Twitter and Facebook 
logos, as shown in Figure 8-13.
You can share Twitter and Facebook updates for periodicals and 
personal documents. Shared items appear on your Facebook wall 
(as a status update) and will be tweeted from your Twitter account. 
These comments will be linked to your page at https://kindle.
amazon.com/. Comments that you share from periodicals and 
personal documents are not posted to Goodreads — Goodreads is 
exclusively for books.
	
When you finish a book, you can rate it and share it on Amazon 
and Goodreads. The Share page is shown in Figure 8-14.
Figure 8-12: Create a Goodreads account with your Amazon credentials.

Playing with pictures
If the book you’re reading has photographs and illustrations, you 
can see more information as well as make notes and marks. To begin, 
press and hold down (long-tap) on the photograph or illustration. 
A magnifying glass appears in the middle of the picture, and a box 
appears with Share, Add Note, Highlight, and More. These choices 
operate in the same way as discussed for words, notes, and highlights.
Tap the magnifying glass to enlarge the picture to full-screen size. If 
appropriate, the photo will rotate to landscape mode for best 
viewing. Tap the picture again to return to your book.
	
Would you like to make a screenshot from your Kindle Paperwhite? 
It’s easy! On the desired page, place your thumbs lightly in the 
upper-right and lower-left corners, and press simultaneously. The 
screen will blink. Use the USB cable to attach your Kindle 
Paperwhite to your computer. The screenshot is listed in the root 
directory. From there you can copy or move the picture to your 
hard drive, rename it, save it, and use it however you want.
Note that the double-thumbpress maneuver takes a bit of practice. If 
your desired screenshot doesn’t appear the first time, just try again.
Viewing with X-Ray
Some books have the X-ray feature enabled. This feature provides a 
view into recurring items: characters, settings, topics, and phrases 
that occur throughout the book. You can view this information for 
the current page, the current chapter, or the entire book.
Tap the top of the screen to display the toolbar, and then tap X-Ray 
to see a screen like the one shown in Figure 8-15. (Note that if the 
X-ray feature is not enabled for the book you’re reading, the option 
will appear dimmed.) Tap any term to view additional information 
from Wikipedia (if enabled) and to see the other locations in the 
book where that term appears.
Going a Little Further with 
Goodreads
As discussed, you can share quotes and short comments from 
Paperwhite to Goodreads, Facebook, and Twitter. But Goodreads offers 
much more for voracious readers. You can use shelves to organize 
your books by those you have read, are currently reading, and want to 
read. You can connect with friends who have similar reading interests 

 Chapter 8: Expanding the Reading Experience 123
to discover new books. And the Updates feature enables you to see 
what your friends are reading and view their comments and ratings.
One particularly useful feature is the capability to add books from 
your Amazon Cloud account to Goodreads. With the Goodreads 
app open, select Add Amazon Books (in the upper right). The 
screen shown in Figure 8-16 appears. From here, you can add books 
to Goodreads, either by rating or by adding the book to a shelf.
If you’re familiar with Goodreads, you will find that the Goodreads 
app has much of the functionality that has been available on 
mobile apps and PCs. If you’re new to Goodreads, take time to play 
with it and discover what you can do. It can be a great tool for 
organizing your library and keeping track of what you’ve read, as 
well as connecting with other readers and friends.
Using Whispersync with Kindle 
Editions and Audible Books
Prior versions of the Kindle e-reader included audio capabilities 
which allowed you to listen to a book on your device or use Text-
to-Speech to have a book read to you. The Kindle Paperwhite does 
Figure 8-15: An example of an X-ray display from a book about Atlantic City.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
124
not include these features, but don’t despair — you can still listen 
to a book and have it sync with the Kindle edition on your Kindle 
Paperwhite by using Whispersync for Voice.
To begin, you will need the following:
	
✓	A Kindle Paperwhite: Make sure that Whispersync is turned 
on at your Amazon account. Go to www.amazon.com/myk 
and select Manage Your Devices. Device Synchronization is 
near the bottom of the page.
	
✓	A device that plays audio files and supports the Audible 
application: The Audible application is designed to play 
books purchased from Audible.com or Audible books 
purchased from Amazon.
	
✓	The Kindle Edition of a book and the Audible audiobook 
version: You need to search on Amazon to find Kindle books 
with Audible counterparts. If a book supports Whispersync 
for Voice, that fact will be noted on the product page, as 
shown in Figure 8-17.
	
	Amazon offers special promotions on Kindle Edition/Audible 
book combos. When you buy a Kindle book, check to see 
whether the Audible book is available at a discounted price.
Figure 8-16: Adding books from your Amazon collection to Goodreads.

 Chapter 8: Expanding the Reading Experience 125
Figure 8-17: A Whispersync for Voice edition is also available, as shown in the 
middle of the page.
Now all you need to do is begin reading (or listening). When you 
switch devices, the synchronization should be automatic. See 
Figure 8-18 for an illustration of the sync screen on your Kindle 
Paperwhite and Figure 8-19 for the screen on the audio device, in 
this case, an iPhone. If the sync does not happen automatically, tap 
Menu➪Sync to Furthest Page Read.
Figure 8-18: Synchronization screen on a Kindle Paperwhite.
	 You do not need to purchase the two books at the same time to 
have them synchronize between the Kindle edition and audiobook. 
Books bought at different times will still sync.
	
At the time of this writing, the synchronization feature was 
available only between Amazon Kindle Editions and audiobooks 
purchased from Audible.com, which is an Amazon company.

Accessing the Experimental 
Browser
Yes indeed, your Kindle Paperwhite sports a built-in browser that 
you can use to access the Internet. The browser isn’t full-featured 
like the one you surf with on your computer, but it is a usable, 
albeit stripped-down, browser that you can take advantage of 
when you’re out somewhere with your Kindle Paperwhite and need 
to get online in a hurry.
	
If you have a Kindle Paperwhite 3G, free web browsing in 3G mode 
is limited. You can access only the Amazon website (including the 
Kindle Store, of course!) and Wikipedia via 3G wireless. For 
accessing other websites, you need to use a Wi-Fi connection.
Although the Kindle Paperwhite’s web browser is simple, it does 
offer some compelling features. Here are some of my favorite 
things about the Kindle Paperwhite web browser:
	
✓	Even though web access is limited under 3G wireless, this 
access is free. (Most devices other than Kindles that use 3G 
require an access fee or monthly charges.) You can access 
Amazon or Wikipedia anytime and anywhere with your Kindle 
Paperwhite 3G — as long as you’re in an area covered by the 
AT&T cellular data network used by the Kindle Paperwhite.
Figure 8-19: Synchronization screen on an audio device.

 Chapter 8: Expanding the Reading Experience 127
	
✓	The web browser provides a convenient way to connect to the 
web any time you’re in a Wi-Fi hotspot. This hotspot could be 
your own home wireless network or the Wi-Fi available in a 
coffee shop or an airport, for example. (Note: Some hotspots 
charge a fee for Internet connectivity.)
	
✓	The Kindle Paperwhite’s web browser enables you to immedi­
ately jump to websites from links provided in e-books, blogs, 
or other content.
	
✓	For simple, text-oriented sites, such as mobile versions of 
most websites, the convenience of having web access avail­
able from your Kindle Paperwhite can be a timesaver.
Conversely, the rudimentary nature of the Kindle Paperwhite web 
browser has some drawbacks, including these:
	
✓	The Kindle Paperwhite’s grayscale display is less than ideal for 
most web browsing. If you’re accessing sites that are rich in 
graphics and colors, you’ll have a less appealing experience.
	
✓	The web browser doesn’t support websites that use Flash or 
Shockwave multimedia effects.
	
✓	Java applets aren’t supported. Some websites use Java 
applets for animations or to provide complex functionality.
	
✓	Videos are not playable through the web browser.
	
✓	The web browser may be unavailable in some countries 
outside the United States.
Getting online
	
	 To access the web browser, tap the Menu icon from the Home 
screen and then tap the Experimental Browser option, as shown in 
Figure 8-20.
The first time you launch the browser, the default Yahoo! screen 
appears. Tap Menu➪Bookmarks to display the default list of 
website bookmarks. Amazon is at the top, followed by Wikipedia, 
Google, and the New York Times. Tap one of the bookmarks to open 
the bookmarked page in the browser. If you leave the browser and 
later return, the last page you viewed will open by default.
	 You can open the browser also by tapping any web address link 
from content that you read on your Kindle Paperwhite, such as a 
book or a blog.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
128
Figure 8-20: Access Amazon’s Experimental browser from the Menu icon.
Browsing basics
Your Kindle Paperwhite web browser displays the web address, 
or URL, in its address bar for the last web page you accessed. To 
change that URL or enter a new one, tap the address bar and use 
the onscreen keyboard to enter your desired URL. Tap the arrow to 
the right to navigate to the site.
	
When entering the URL, you can leave out the http:// prefix and 
the www part of the address. For example, you can type cnn.com 
rather than http://www.cnn.com.
	
On web pages that have more content than can fit on one dis­
played page, a scroll bar appears on the right side of the browser. 
You can drag your finger around the page to scroll up and down to 
view more of the page.
You can use bookmarks to save frequently used web pages and to 
avoid reentering long URLs from the Kindle Paperwhite’s onscreen 
keyboard. Here are the essentials for working with web browser 
bookmarks: 

 Chapter 8: Expanding the Reading Experience 129
	
✓	Adding a bookmark: Tap Menu➪Bookmark This Page.
	
✓	Accessing your saved bookmarks: From the web browser, 
tap Menu➪Bookmarks. Use this method to access the sample 
bookmarks that Amazon has preloaded on your Kindle 
Paperwhite as well.
	
✓	Deleting a bookmark: Tap Remove at the bottom of the 
bookmarks screen. A check box appears for each displayed 
bookmark. Tap the check box for one or more bookmarks, and 
then tap Remove.
	
✓	Editing a bookmark: Tap Edit at the bottom of the bookmarks 
screen. Tap a bookmark to edit its name.
Given the nature of the Kindle Paperwhite’s display size, you’ll 
probably want to zoom in on areas of a web page. Unpinch on the 
display to zoom in, and pinch to zoom out. (See Chapter 3 for more 
on how to navigate the Kindle Paperwhite’s touchscreen.) When 
the page is zoomed in, you can pan around the web page by 
swiping your finger across the display.
Special settings
You usually don’t have to be concerned about the default settings 
of your Kindle Paperwhite’s web browser. However, situations may 
arise in which tinkering with the settings can resolve problems and 
improve the speed of browsing from one page to another.
You can see the available options from any web page by tapping 
Menu➪Browser Settings. The following options are available:
	
✓	Clear History: Your Kindle Paperwhite saves the URLs and 
content from web pages you’ve visited previously, to speed 
up load times when you visit those pages again. Use the Clear 
History option to delete this saved information.
	
✓	Clear Cookies: Some web pages save small strings of infor­
mation, or cookies, on your Kindle Paperwhite’s hard drive. 
Cookies can be used, for example, to save your login informa­
tion so you don’t have to reenter it on each page of a site. 
Use the Clear Cookies option to delete this information. You 
may want to do this if your web browser doesn’t respond or 
responds very slowly.
	
✓	Disable JavaScript: Many websites use JavaScript to pro­
vide enhanced functionality, such as submenus that appear 
dynamically when a main menu option is selected. If you find 
that the web browser responds slowly, try using this option to 
disable JavaScript.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
130
	
✓	Disable Images: Depending on the speed of your Internet con­
nection, web page graphics and pictures can be slow to load. 
You can choose to eliminate the images and view only the text 
content of web pages by selecting the Disable Images option.
	
Some web pages have articles, which are defined areas that can 
make reading a web page easier. For example, news sites often 
organize their content into articles to define sections of text and 
graphics that belong together. You can view articles more conve­
niently by tapping Menu➪Article Mode. Your Kindle Paperwhite’s 
web browser will now filter the content it displays to the desired 
article’s text and images.
Article Mode works well with many news sites. When viewing the 
article, swipe the display to scroll up or down. To turn off Article 
Mode, tap Menu➪Web Mode.

Kindles for Kids and Students
In This Chapter
▶	Assessing a child’s readiness for a Kindle
▶	Nurturing a love of reading in children
▶	Kindling for students at all education levels
W

hen the Kindle was first released in 2007, it was expensive 
and available books were limited primarily to novels — 
thus it was considered by many to be a device for adult readers, 
not children and students. Since then, much has changed and 
the Kindle is widely adopted in schools and colleges. Young read­
ers own their own Kindles and tote them to camp, school, and 
sleepovers. For many children who have resisted reading, owning 
a Kindle has changed their outlook and truly “Kindled” a new love 
for books.
This chapter introduces you to the world of Kindles and kids. 
If you are a parent wondering about whether to buy a Kindle for 
your child, read on. In addition, school innovations are briefly 
­discussed. If you are a teacher, maybe some of the information 
here will fire your imagination and encourage you to learn more.
This book is specifically about the Kindle Paperwhite, but many 
schools and colleges use other Kindle devices, including the Kindle 
Fire, which is the Android tablet device of the Kindle family. 
A full discussion of all alternatives and opportunities is beyond 
the scope of this chapter, but it does provide a good starting point 
for all who are interested in Kindle usage with their children and 
students.

Is Kindle Right for Your Child?
You’ve bought a Kindle Paperwhite and love the e-ink screen and 
built-in light. You want to buy one for your child. Before you do so, 
consider the following factors:
	
✓	Age: The Kindle Paperwhite is a grayscale device, so it is 
not ideal for young children reading pictures books. In 
addition, young children won’t understand that the Kindle 
Paperwhite is breakable and needs to be handled with care. 
As a general rule, if a child is reading chapter books, he or 
she is probably old enough to handle a Kindle Paperwhite 
safely.
	
	If you have a Kindle Fire, you might investigate using that to 
read picture books to a young child. Also, the Paperwhite’s 
built-in light makes it the perfect device to use when read­
ing chapter books and beloved favorites aloud at bedtime. 
Don’t be afraid to experiment and see what your child 
enjoys.
	
	Many reading experts suggest reading books to your children 
slightly above their current reading level. You can discuss new 
words and concepts and use the dictionary to look up 
­definitions.
	
✓	Track record with electronic devices: Following on the pre­
ceding bullet point, how has your child fared with electronic 
devices in the past? Has he or she dropped, broken, or lost 
them? The front of the Kindle Paperwhite is about 95 percent 
screen and can be easily broken. Keep this in mind as you 
consider a purchase for your child.
	
✓	Interest in reading: The case studies about the success rate 
of Kindles in schools would lead you to believe that all chil­
dren magically become avid readers once the device is placed 
in their hands. I am sure that the novelty of the device does 
intrigue many children and encourage them to read. At the 
same time, parental involvement is also part of successfully 
using a Kindle to encourage a reluctant reader to become 
more engaged with books. Note that many educators consider 
children aged 7 to 11 to be at the ideal age to develop a life­
long love of reading. A marker for readiness is the transition 
from picture books to chapter books.

 Chapter 9: Kindles for Kids and Students 133
	
Remember that our children are digital natives and have grown up 
with technology. They take to it more easily than those of us who 
are (ahem!) a bit older.
If you decide to go ahead and purchase a Kindle for your child, 
remember the following points:
	
✓	Protective covers: Buy a protective cover and encourage your 
child to use it. As noted, Kindles are fragile and need to be 
treated with care. If your child prefers to read the device out 
of a cover, make sure he or she has some sort of protective 
envelope or sleeve for storage during nonreading times. A 
wide variety of covers and other paraphernalia are discussed 
in Chapter 10.
	
✓	Backpack packing: Even with a cover, a Kindle Paperwhite 
could be crushed or damaged if tossed carelessly in a 
­backpack with a load of heavy books. Look through your 
child’s backpack with him or her and designate a specific 
pocket as its “home” to be used when the backpack is 
­carried.
	
✓	Kindle at school or camp: If your child hopes to take her 
Kindle to school or camp (or somewhere else), take a few 
minutes to contact the administrator and make sure this is 
okay. Policies vary widely and change frequently. The use 
of personal electronic devices, such as Kindles, may be 
discouraged or prohibited due to issues of theft or competi­
tion among ­children. On the other hand, a school may have 
a Kindle ­program in place but not enough devices for all 
students — and the teachers would be thrilled to have your 
child bring his or her own device. You’ll never know unless 
you ask.
	
	You can also be an advocate for Kindle use in your child’s 
school. If the administrators or teachers are not familiar with 
the device and how it can be used, take advantage of this 
teachable moment! Let them know how much you enjoy your 
Kindle Paperwhite and why you think it would enhance the 
learning environment in their classrooms. The National PTA 
has a variety of resources for encouraging the use of Kindles 
at home and at school — this is discussed a bit later in this 
chapter.

Using Parental Controls
When you buy a Kindle for your child, it will be registered to your 
Amazon account. Your child will have access to the Kindle Store 
to make purchases as well as being able to view and ­download 
books in the Cloud. The Kindle’s experimental web browser and 
the Goodreads app (see Chapter 8) are also ­accessible. You 
can restrict your child’s access to all four by using parental 
­controls.
To access parental controls, tap Menu➪Settings➪Device 
Options➪Parental Controls➪Restrictions. The screen shown in 
Figure 9-1 appears. Tap the toggle switch for Web Browser, Kindle 
Store, Cloud, or Goodreads to restrict access. You’ll be asked to 
enter a password, as shown in Figure 9-2. Input a hint to help you 
remember your password.

Figure 9-2: Set a password for parental controls.
Note that when access to the web, store, or Cloud is restricted 
with parental controls, you will not be able to deregister your 
Kindle Paperwhite, nor will you be able to update the software run­
ning the device unless you use the password to unlock the device. 
The Shopping Cart and Goodreads icons are also dimmed, as 
shown in Figure 9-3.
	
Parental controls affect only the local Kindle on which they are 
enabled. Other Kindles on your account can still access the Cloud, 
Goodreads, the Kindle Store, and the Kindle web browser.
Only you can decide if you need to use parental controls for your 
child’s Kindle. When these controls are on, your child cannot 
sample content, download free books, or borrow books from the 
Kindle Owners’ Library (if you have Amazon Prime). On the other 
hand, without parental controls, your child has free rein to buy 
things from the store — on your credit card — and can see and 
download books in the Cloud. You need to weigh these alternatives 
to make the best decision.

Igniting a Love of Reading
As noted earlier, just putting a Kindle in a child’s hands is prob­
ably not going to turn him or her into an avid reader overnight. 
However, you can take advantage of certain Kindle features to help 
nurture a reading interest and make it flourish into an enjoyable 
hobby and lifelong habit.
Make reading fun
Encourage your children to take advantage of the various features 
of the Kindle Paperwhite to personalize their device and make 
reading fun. Show them how to change the font, font size, line 
spacing, and margins to customize the screen for the best read­
ing experience. Show them how to adjust the light for different 
Figure 9-3: Note that shopping, the experimental browser, and Goodreads appear 
dimmed when parental controls are turned on.

 Chapter 9: Kindles for Kids and Students 137
lighting conditions. Take advantage of the teachable moment to 
explain why you want a brighter light in a brightly lit area versus a 
dimmer light in low light conditions. (If you don’t remember why, 
see Chapter 3).
	
	 Remember, you change the font, font size, line spacing, and mar­
gins from the same menu. Tap at the top of the screen, and then 
tap the icon shown in the margin to display the Fonts menu, shown 
in Figure 9-4.
Dictionary and X-ray are powerful features that can also spur an 
interest in reading. Children are often discouraged by ­reading 
because they don’t understand the words or are confused by 
­locations and ­characters. Teach them how easy it is to look up 
a word by simply long-tapping — the dictionary will open and 
­display the definition. X-ray is helpful as a refresher of characters 
and places, as shown in Figure 9-5.
Translation is another feature that children find intriguing. 
From the dictionary page, tap More, and then tap Translation. 
Remember that the Kindle Paperwhite can provide translations of 
a word into 16 languages, from Chinese to Spanish. Give your child 
a challenge: Choose a common word, such as Thanks, and translate 
it into several languages. Which ones are ­similar? Which ones are 
different? Which ones don’t even look like English?
Figure 9-4: Adjust the font, font size, line spacing, and margins all from the 
same menu.

Vocabulary Builder
Remember that every time a word is accessed in the dictionary, 
it is added to a running list of words in Vocabulary Builder. Within 
a book, this list is accessed by tapping Menu➪Vocabulary Builder. 
Show your child how to sort the list by word or by book. Have your 
child tap Flashcards to practice a definition and see the word used in 
context, and then tap Mark as Mastered to remove the word from the 
Flashcard list. For more detail on Vocabulary Builder, see Chapter 8.
Kindle Free Time
The Kindle Free Time application, which is available for the Kindle 
Fire and Kindle Paperwhite, allows you to create individual profiles 
for your children and customize a reading goal of minutes per day 
with badges and rewards. As a parent, you can access a ­progress 
report that lets you see the total time spent reading, badges 
earned, and books finished.
Kindle Free Time lets you designate books your child can access 
from your Cloud at Amazon. Kindle Free Time is activated when 
you set a password for parental controls. To access parental 
Figure 9-5: Use X-ray to remind yourself of who a character is in a novel.

­controls, tap Menu➪Settings➪Device Options➪Parental Controls. 
Tap Kindle Free Time and the screen shown in Figure 9-6 appears. 
Follow the on screen instructions to add a profile for your 
­children. You can add books from the Cloud to their individual 
­profiles.
When reading in Kindle Free Time, the Goodreads icon on the tool­
bar is replaced by a badge. Tap the badge to access a variety of 
goals, such as Book Worm (30 minutes of reading) or Super Book 
Worm (reading 30 minutes a day for 7 days).
Figure 9-6: Create customized reading profiles in Kindle Free Time.
While in Kindle Free Time, a number of features are blocked:
	
✓	Browsing and purchasing in the Kindle Store
	
✓	Access to the experimental web browser
	
✓	Access to Wikipedia
	
✓	Social sharing on Facebook, Goodreads, and Twitter

 Kindles Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

In some ways, Kindle Free Time mimics parental controls 
(­discussed previously). However, Kindle Free Time blocks these 
features only when Kindle Free Time is turned on and a child is 
reading within his or her profile. When Kindle Free Time is exited — 
which must be done by reentering the password you selected — 
these features are reactivated.
After Kindle Free Time has been activated on your Kindle, it 
appears as a menu choice on your Home screen, as shown in 
Figure 9-7. It also becomes a menu choice when you tap the Menu 
icon, as shown in Figure 9-8.
In-line footnotes
Older children may read books with footnotes. The Kindle 
Paperwhite makes it much easier to look up footnotes than earlier 
versions of the device. Simply tap the superscripted number or the 
footnote mark to open the page in Footnote, as shown in Figure 9-9. 
To exit the footnote, tap the X in the upper-right corner. To read all 
the footnotes in a book, tap Go to Footnotes.
Figure 9-7: Kindle Free Time appears as an option on the Home screen.

Be creative with content
Keep reading fun for your child by encouraging a variety of 
books — nothing kills a burgeoning love of reading faster than 
getting stuck with a stack of boring books! At that same time, you 
want to protect your wallet. Take advantage of the many free deals 
and bargain-priced books that Amazon offers. Hundreds of free 
out-of-copyright classics can be obtained from Amazon and other 
sources, such as Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org/).
More tips to encourage a love of reading
The National PTA has teamed up with Amazon to promote reading and has selected 
the Kindle as its official e-reader. They offer the following tips to encourage a love 
of reading in all children (adapted from National PTA, https://images-na.
ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/pta/pta-tips-
download.pdf):
	✓	Encourage reading in your home. Set an example by reading in front of your 
child both for pleasure and practicality. Create a special place in your home 
where you can read together.
	✓	Spend 30 minutes each day reading together. When reading with your child, ask 
him or her to describe what is going on in the scene or happening in the story.
	✓	Sign up your child for a library card. You can borrow books from the library for 
Kindle using OverDrive, but you must have a library card to do so. A library card 
also lets your child borrow books the old-fashioned way.
	✓	Attend a library event. Look for a schedule of story times and author readings 
— most libraries host these types of events weekly or monthly.
	✓	Become involved at your child’s school. Communicate with teachers to moni­
tor your child’s progress. Ask what you can do at home to support your child’s 
reading.
	✓	Applaud your child for reading. Reward your child for reading a certain number 
of books or finishing a challenging book. Kindle Free Time allows you to monitor 
progress and recognize achievements.
	✓	Give books as presents. Give books as a gift, especially on topics your child 
enjoys. It’s easy to gift books for the Kindle Paperwhite — see Chapter 6.
	✓	Help your child write his or her own stories. Encourage your child to write sto­
ries based on his or her experiences or favorite characters from other books, 
movies, or TV shows.
	✓	Make flashcards to learn new words. Vocabulary Builder is ideal for this task!
	✓	Take your child to the eye doctor. Schedule an eye exam to ensure that any 
vision problems are promptly addressed.

Amazon has a weekly e-mail list through its Amazon Delivers 
­program specifically for books for children at a variety of ages.

Don’t forget borrowing
Not all content has to be purchased. If you’re an Amazon Prime 
member, take advantage of the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library, 
which is discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Remember that only 
one book per month can be borrowed from the Kindle Owners’ 
Lending Library per account under this program. If you have 
­multiple Kindles on your account, you may want to devise a plan 
so that everyone has equal access to the library. Alternatively, you 
may decide that your child can take advantage of one free book 
every month. Keep in mind that thousands of books are available 
through this program.
Your local library is another reliable source of books to borrow. 
More than 11,000 libraries in the United States have Kindle books 
available to loan. To find a library in your area, go to http://
search.overdrive.com/ and select Library Search. After you 
identify a library for borrowing, you’ll need to contact it for 
a library card (if you don’t already have one) and a PIN.
To find a book of interest, search your selected library’s website. 
Available books will be displayed. If a book is currently checked 
out, you can place a hold to receive the book when it is available. 
Follow the online instructions to borrow and receive the book. 
Library books must be delivered via Wi-Fi, not 3G. Some library 
books must be downloaded by connecting your Kindle Paperwhite 
to your computer with the USB cable.

 Kindles Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
144
Library books are available for a fixed period of time, depending 
on the policy of your selected library. Amazon will send you a 
reminder e-mail three days before the book is due to be returned. 
If you want to return a book earlier than its due date, go to Manage 
Your Kindle (www.amazon.com/myk), find the book in your Cloud, 
and select the option to return it.
	
Borrowing books from public libraries is presently available only in 
the United States.
	
Amazon has a two-minute video on borrowing books from the 
library. You can watch it at www.amazon.com/gp/help/­
customer/display.html/?nodeId=200747550.
Kindle on Campus
Sending your child to school with his or her Kindle (if allowed) is a 
great way to encourage reading during quiet time and designated 
reading periods, but it doesn’t have to be an individual experience. 
Many teachers and librarians throughout the country are exploring 
innovative ways to incorporate Kindles and other reading devices 
into their classrooms and curricula.
Whispercast
Amazon has a number of case studies that demonstrate how the 
Kindle is being used to develop a passion for reading and increase 
student literacy. You can read more at www.amazon.com/gp/
feature.html?docId=1000412651.
Central to many of these programs is Whispercast, a free online 
program that allows schools (and businesses) to manage Kindles 
and distribute Kindle content to the devices registered to the 
master Whispercast account. An organization can sign up for 
Whispercast at https://whispercast.amazon.com/signup/.
Whispercast streamlines the process of sending Kindle 
content to readers registered to the account. Books, apps, 
and other materials can be managed from a central account 
and sent to all users on the account or selected groups. For 
­example, Clearwater High School in Pinellas County, Florida, 
provided 3,628 Kindles to students in the 9th through 12th 
grades, and Whispercast is being used to manage the content 
­requirements for these students. Teachers are finding new ways 
to use the Kindles by downloading handouts, study guides, and 
documents such as the U.S. Constitution. Administrators note 

 Chapter 9: Kindles for Kids and Students 145
that students are reading more, and students appreciate the 
lightened load in their backpacks, with many books on a single 
device.
The video at www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQOv1c7sQ20 pro­
vides a nice overview of Whispercast in action at two schools.
National PTA
In 2013, the National PTA teamed up with Amazon and adopted 
the Kindle as its national e-reader. They’ve developed a variety of 
learning programs and pedagogical materials that can be used at 
the local level to encourage and support reading in school and at 
home. “The PTA Family Reading Experience, Powered by Kindle” 
focuses on improving the reading skills of children between kinder­
garten and fifth grade. Activities are designed to be fun and engag­
ing, while addressing the five domains of reading: phonological 
awareness, phonics, fluency, comprehension, and vocabulary. To 
learn more and download activity guides in English and Spanish, 
visit www.pta.org/familyreading.
For college students
Amazon has a number of features and promotions for college 
students, although not all of them are Kindle-based. For example, 
Amazon Student allows college students to sign up for a free six-
month trial of Amazon Prime, which provides free two-day ship­
ping on all purchases, including textbooks. After six months, the 
cost is $39/year (50 percent off the regular price) — after this kicks 
in, the program includes access to instant streaming videos and TV 
episodes, as well as access to the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library.
Textbooks are available for the Kindle in several disciplines, such 
as accounting, art history, economics, mathematics, nursing, 
philosophy, and science. Texts are being added daily — check 
­frequently to see if there are textbooks that apply to your studies.
In many textbooks, enhanced features such as X-Ray for Textbooks 
and Notebook are best viewed and used on a full-color device such 
as the Kindle Fire HD. In fact, you may not even be able to down­
load a sample or purchase a textbook for the Kindle Paperwhite. 
Check at the product page for the book you are interested in to see 
what devices are available for delivery. Note that many textbooks 
can be viewed on various devices, such as the iPad, Android tablet, 
laptop, or Mac using the Kindle for Reading App. This app is free — 
see Chapter 4 for more details.

 Kindles Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Textbooks can be sampled, purchased, or rented. Renting offers a 
cheaper alternative to purchasing a book, as noted in the “Renting 
Kindle books” sidebar. All textbooks, no matter how acquired, can 
be returned within seven days for a full refund.
Renting Kindle books
Amazon now enables you to rent a textbook in Kindle format. Books can be rented 
for a specific time period, usually between 30 and 360 days. Books that are avail­
able for rental have the Rent This Book designation on the product page.
If you decide you want to buy a rented book, your rental fee will be applied to the 
purchase price. However, you must purchase the book during the rental period; 
after the rental has expired, you lose the rental credit and need to pay full price to 
purchase the book.
When the rental expires, the book will no longer be available on your Kindle 
Paperwhite (or another device on which you may be reading the book). However, if 
you’ve made notes and highlights in the book, these will be saved in your account 
at Amazon.
Rental books can be returned for a full refund within 7 days of rental, the same 
as with any Kindle book purchase. This policy is helpful for students who decide 
to drop a class and no longer need the book. What if a student chooses a 90-day 
rental and then needs the book for only 30 days? Unfortunately, Amazon does not 
provide partial refunds.
To learn more, go to Kindle Support at www.amazon.com/gp/help/
customer/display.html/ and search for Renting Kindle Books.

K

indle Paperwhite accessories come in hundreds of varieties 
and colors. You can use a skin, screen protector, or cover to 
protect your Kindle Paperwhite, but these accessories can also be 
fashion statements. Accessorize your Kindle Paperwhite and give it 
your own personal pizzazz.
In this chapter, I discuss an assortment of accessories, including 
vinyl skins, covers, and bags, plus lights, styli, plugs, adapters, and 
stands. I wrap up the chapter with a brief discussion of damage 
protection policies from Amazon and third-party sources.
Adding the First Layer
When you buy a Kindle Paperwhite, it ships in a simple box with 
a USB cable and a card of instructions. That’s it! Many people 
like to read the Kindle Paperwhite as is, right out of the box. 
But if you want to hide smudges and dirt while dressing up your 
device, a skin serves well as the first layer. To protect your Kindle 
Paperwhite from scratches, check out screen protectors. Is either 
essential? No, but that doesn’t detract from their popularity!
Vinyl skins
One of the major complaints of the first-generation Kindle was that 
it looked old-fashioned and bulky. Many people didn’t care for the 
off-white case. The solution? Vinyl skins, which are like a second 
skin and have been produced for all versions of Kindle e-readers. 

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
148
Because they’re vinyl, skins adhere to the device without glue or 
adhesive. Skin makers have responded to the demand with an 
astonishing array of designs.
	
Some Kindle Paperwhite owners have reported that the black bezel 
shows fingerprints and smudges much more readily than earlier 
models. A skin is the ideal solution for this issue.
The skin comes in two pieces for the front (with a cutout for the 
screen) and the back. To apply the skin, peel the vinyl from the 
backing sheet, place it on the Kindle Paperwhite in the correct 
place, and smooth out any air bubbles. That’s it!
Keep in mind the following hints to make skin application as 
effortless as possible:
	
✓	Take your time. Give yourself a few minutes to apply a skin. 
Don’t try to do it when you’re in a hurry.
	
✓	Use a clean and well lit work surface.
	
✓	Wash your hands. You don’t want to leave smudges or fin­
gerprints on the skin. Also, oil from your skin could make the 
vinyl not adhere as well.
	
✓	Clean the Kindle Paperwhite surface before applying the 
skin. Don’t use solvents or cleaners on the device. Just rub 
the front bezel and back clean with a soft cloth.
	
✓	Adhere the back piece first. The large back piece is easier to 
work with than the front. After you get the knack of placing 
a skin, adhere the front piece on the bezel surrounding the 
screen.
	
	People with small, delicate hands usually have an easier time 
applying a skin. If that’s not you, consider asking someone 
with smaller hands for help.
	 If you buy a skin from DecalGirl, the piece for the back of the 
Kindle Paperwhite is a perfect fit for the inside of the Amazon 
cover. This might be a colorful option to dress up the inside front 
cover if you don’t plan on taking your Kindle Paperwhite out of its 
Amazon case.
The skin can be removed easily for repositioning while you’re 
applying it but becomes semi-permanent after it’s on for a few 
hours. If you decide to change the skin, you can pull it off easily 
after you work an edge free, but it’s likely to stretch out of shape. 
Although some people have been able to reuse a skin after an 
initial application, plan on using it only once.

 Chapter 10: Accessorizing 149
	
Some people have had success reshaping a skin that has been 
removed from a Kindle Paperwhite by using a hair dryer on the 
warm setting.
The following are some advantages of a vinyl skin:
	
✓	Decoration: For a small investment of approximately $9–$30, 
you can change the look of your Kindle Paperwhite as the 
spirit moves you.
	
✓	Free of dirt and finger smudges: If the skin gets dirty, you can 
easily take it off and replace it. Cleaning the Kindle Paperwhite 
case is a little trickier because you don’t want cleaning solu­
tion to accidentally seep into the screen around the bezel.
A number of skin manufacturers exist, and many sell their 
products on Amazon. The following are three of the most popular 
retailers of vinyl skins with designs for the Kindle Paperwhite:
	
✓	DecalGirl (www.decalgirlcom): One of the first out of the 
gate with skins for the original Kindle, DecalGirl sells its skins 
on Amazon and on its website. Choose from hundreds of 
designs in a matte or shiny finish or design your own for a 
reasonable price.
	
✓	GelaSkins (www.gelaskins.com): Another popular 
manufacturer with skins sold through its website, GelaSkins 
features one-of-a-kind designs from up-and-coming as well as 
established artists. The company also allows you to use your 
own photos or art to create custom skins.
	
✓	iStyles (www.istyles.com): Based in Singapore, this 
company creates vinyl skins for many devices. You can pay 
in U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds, or Singapore dollars 
and have your skin shipped worldwide. Skin prices are 
comparable to those of U.S. manufacturers and shipping 
costs are reasonable.
Skins aren’t just for the Kindle family of e-readers. All the 
manufacturers listed here make skins for a variety of devices, 
including laptops, smartphones, and gaming consoles.
Screen protectors
Screen protectors are just what the name implies — a plastic 
covering for the screen to keep it safe from scratches and 
smudges. Users have mixed opinions regarding whether they’re 
necessary. On one hand, the screen is the most delicate part of 

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
150
the Kindle Paperwhite, and although you can wipe off a smudge, 
a scratch is permanent. A screen protector can be an inexpensive 
way to provide a layer of security for your device. On the other 
hand, screen protectors can be tough to apply and can obscure 
the screen, making reading more difficult. Because the Kindle 
Paperwhite is all about reading, having something that may 
interfere with that pastime isn’t a bonus.
Keep in mind that the Kindle Paperwhite is a touchscreen device. 
You do need to put your fingers on the screen to turn the page, 
look up words in the dictionary, or buy e-books from the Kindle 
Store. The screen will get dirty. Plus, you may splash milk on it 
while eating a bowl of cereal or sneeze on it. I leave the 
decision of whether the screen protector is necessary up to you.
The following companies offer screen protectors:
	
✓	BoxWave (www.boxwave.com): This company offers two 
screen protectors, one with an anti-glare feature and a second 
with crystal-clear viewing. It also offers the Screen Puff, an 
ultrapuffy screen wiper, available in seven colors — you can 
coordinate with your cover and skin!
	
✓	M-Edge (www.medgestore.com): Visit this company for a 
two-pack of screen protectors, plus a cleaning cloth.
	
✓	Great Shield: Get a three-pack of screen protectors from this 
company by going to www.amazon.com/GreatShield-
Anti-Glare-Protector-Paperwhite-Keyboard/dp/
B004JWA70I.
	
When searching for screen protectors, make sure to specify the 
Kindle Paperwhite or a 6-inch screen device. Screen protectors for 
the Kindle Touch will fit the Kindle Paperwhite because they both 
have 6-inch screens. Protectors for earlier versions of the Kindle, 
however, will not fit the Kindle Paperwhite screen.
Covering Your Device
If you want to buy only one add-on for your Kindle Paperwhite, 
­I suggest a cover, a sleeve, an envelope, or a jacket because it will 
protect your Kindle Paperwhite, particularly the screen, from 
damage. Although nothing is foolproof, having the screen covered 
when the Kindle Paperwhite isn’t in use is a good idea.

 Chapter 10: Accessorizing 151
Following is a description of these essential add-ons:
	
✓	Cover: In general, a Kindle Paperwhite cover is kept on the 
device at all times, even while reading. Most covers fold back 
for reading and close with a snap, a buckle, a magnet, or an 
elastic cord.
	
✓	Sleeve: Neoprene sleeves are usually close fitting and may 
have a zipper closure. Some users who opt not to use a cover 
protect their Kindle Paperwhite in a sleeve.
	
✓	Envelope: Similar to a sleeve but not quite as form-fitting, an 
envelope is another option for readers who prefer to use their 
Kindle Paperwhite without a cover.
	
✓	Jacket: A jacket is like a bag or suit for your Kindle Paperwhite. 
The device goes inside, and the jacket is secured with a zipper. 
Some jackets are clear vinyl to provide protection while 
reading near water or in dusty areas.
Covers, sleeves, envelopes, and jackets are among the most 
popular Kindle Paperwhite accessories, so you can choose 
from plenty of options.
Covers galore!
Kindle Paperwhite covers are available in a variety of materials, 
from fabric to leather to neoprene, at prices ranging from less than 
$20 to more than $200. To get a sense of the variety out there, go to 
Amazon (www.amazon.com) and choose Kindle➪Accessories from 
the navigation menu at the left. On the page that appears, you’ll 
see covers featured prominently.
Securing the device
Most covers are secured to the Kindle Paperwhite by using one of 
the following options:
	
✓	Tabs: Simply slip the Kindle Paperwhite under the tab in each 
corner to hold it in place. Covers from Belkin, M-Edge, and 
Oberon are popular examples of covers that use tabs.
	
	Oberon Design, a small family-owned business based in Santa 
Rosa, California, makes hand-tooled leather covers, such as red 
Gingko, orchid Iris, and navy Hokusai Wave (see Figure 10-1). 
Visit www.oberondesign.com to find out more.
	
✓	Drop-in/snap-in: Drop the Kindle Paperwhite into a snap-in 
frame. The Amazon cover uses this design. Pad & Quill (www.
padandquill.com) makes a wood and leather snap-in case 
that looks like a book when closed, as shown in Figure 10-2.

 Chapter 10: Accessorizing 153
The Amazon cover
The cover from Amazon deserves special mention due to its 
unique feature: Open the cover and the Kindle Paperwhite turns 
on; close the cover and it puts the device to sleep. This “magic” is 
accomplished by a small magnet built into the corner of the case.
The cover is made of leather with a felt lining on the inside front 
cover and is available in seven colors. Figure 10-3 shows a Kindle 
Paperwhite inserted in the snap-in case — and sporting a vinyl 
skin from DecalGirl. (See the previous “Vinyl skins” section for 
details about this accessory.)
Figure 10-3: A Kindle Paperwhite secured in the Amazon cover.
Amazon recently introduced a cover that you can customize by 
adding a favorite photo. As of this writing, reviews on the appear­
ance and attractiveness of the cover are mixed. Choosing a 
high-resolution photograph and realizing that the texture of the 
cover will show through seem to be key for customer satisfac­
tion. You can learn more at this link: www.amazon.com/Kindle-
Paperwhite-Black-Leather–Create/dp/B00DUQURNG/.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
154
	
If you put a small magnet in the corner of any cover with a front 
pocket (such as the one from Oberon), the cover will wake up your 
Kindle Paperwhite automatically when you open it and put it in 
Sleep mode when closed.
Sleeves and envelopes for 
naked reading
Do you prefer to read your Kindle Paperwhite without the encum­
brance of a cover? If so, consider a sleeve or an envelope rather 
than a cover for protection.
	
If you’re crafty, consider making your own sleeve! You can buy a 
pattern to make a Kindle sleeve from Birdiful Stitches. You can find 
details at www.etsy.com/listing/55622726/padded-
e-reader-sleeve-sewing-pattern.
Sleeves are usually tight-fitting and may not have a zipper, snap, 
or other sort of closure device. They protect the Kindle when 
you aren’t reading it — period. They don’t have a place to attach 
a reading light or store the charger. On the plus side, sleeves 
are small and don’t add a lot of bulk to your device. A Kindle 
Paperwhite in a sleeve can easily slip into a purse, messenger bag, 
or briefcase.
A variation on a sleeve is the less form-fitting envelope. As shown 
in Figure 10-4, BoxWave (www.boxwave.com) has taken the word 
envelope literally with its manila leather envelope, which looks like 
an envelope you’d receive in interoffice mail, right down to the red 
string closure.
Protect your device from the elements
The Kindle Paperwhite is a delicate electronic device that can be damaged by 
moisture, dust, sand, or soot. If you regularly read at the beach or next to the pool, 
consider a plastic jacket or case to protect your device.
If you want to buy a protective cover, consider the Medium Whanganui case from 
Aquapac (http://usstore.aquapac.net). This case floats and is sub­
mersible up to 15 feet. The company offers free shipping on orders over $20. For an 
inexpensive alternative, put your Kindle Paperwhite in a plastic one-quart reclosable 
storage bag. You can still read the screen and navigate with the touchscreen.

 Chapter 10: Accessorizing 155

Zip into a jacket!
Many Kindle Paperwhite users choose a jacket for protection and 
convenience. Jackets are typically made of fabric, such as canvas 
or microfiber, and secure the device inside, usually by corner tabs. 
In addition, jackets have a zipper closure, which provides more 
security than a cover. Some jackets have extra features, such as a 
front pocket or a place to store the USB cable.
Jackets provide all-in-one security in a convenient, lightweight 
package. You can find a wide variety of jackets in the Kindle Store 
on Amazon. While on your computer, from the Search drop-down 
list, choose Kindle Store, type accessories jackets on the search 
bar, and click Go.
	
For $50, you can design your own jacket at M-Edge using your own 
artwork or photographs (www.medgestore.com).

Adding a Final Protective Layer
Many people don’t consider their accessorizing complete until 
they add a bag or case to their Kindle Paperwhite’s wardrobe. Bags 
range in size from petite — essentially a sleeve — to larger models 
that allow you to easily tote your Kindle, cover, charging cable, 
portable light, and whatever else you might have on hand. Unlike 
sleeves and jackets, bags and cases usually have a strap, such as a 
wristlet or a shoulder strap. You can also find fanny packs for your 
Kindle Paperwhite. Bags and cases are usually padded, adding one 
more layer of protection for the Kindle Paperwhite screen.
The popular Borsa Bella bags (www.borsabella.com) come in 
a variety of fabrics and sizes. The owner, Melissa Wisen, can even 
monogram your bag!
Adding the Finishing Touch
So far, I’ve described accessories that you put your Kindle 
Paperwhite in or accessories that go on your Kindle Paperwhite. In 
this section, I talk about external accessories: reading lights, styli, 
chargers, and more. Once again, you have plenty of options to 
choose from!
Portable reading lights
Unlike previous models of Kindles, the e-ink screen on the Kindle 
Paperwhite has a built-in integrated light, so an external light 
source is not required for reading. However, a portable reading 
light continues to be a popular accessory even for the Paperwhite. 
The variety of portable reading lights has boomed in recent years. 
If you opt to buy a light, the following suggestions will help you 
select the best one for your reading needs.
A reading light needs a power source. Rechargeable lights tend to 
be lighter and more expensive than lights that use batteries.
	
You can use rechargeable batteries in a battery-operated light, but 
you still have to contend with the added weight.
When checking out battery-operated lights, determine what type of 
battery is required. AA or AAA batteries cost less but weigh more 
than more specialized disk batteries.

 Chapter 10: Accessorizing 157
	
No matter what sort of battery your light uses, always keep a spare 
set on hand.
A stylus for the touchscreen
Another accessory option for Kindle Paperwhite owners is a stylus 
for the touchscreen. Figure 10-5 shows a stylus alongside two other 
useful accessories, an adapter plug and a USB cable (described in 
the next section).
Figure 10-5: A stylus, an adapter plug, and a USB cable.
Why use a stylus? Some people prefer the more precise tip to tap 
the screen and menu options. A stylus can also keep the screen 
cleaner — no need to worry about dirt and oils on your fingers 
getting on the screen. If you’re searching for a stylus, look for one 
that is designed to be used with a capacitive screen.
BoxWave (www.boxwave.com) makes a small bullet-style stylus 
with an attachment to hang on a keychain as well as a combo 
stylus with a ballpoint pen on one end and capacitive foam at the 
other. Amazon also sells a number of styli at a variety of price 
points. Just search for Kindle stylus in the Kindle Store.
	
Styli that work on the Kindle Fire (or other tablets) will work just 
fine on the Kindle Paperwhite.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
158
	
Unlike the Kindle Touch, which used an infrared screen, the Kindle 
Paperwhite uses a capacitive screen. With an infrared screen, 
paired light beams and receptors sense when a finger, a stylus, or 
another object touches the screen and interrupts the light beam. 
The touch triggers an action, such as turning the page. Capacitive 
screens work with only a bare finger or a capacitive stylus. A 
capacitive screen uses a conductive layer on the underside of 
the screen through which a small amount of electricity flows. 
A touch on the screen causes a change in capacitance, which 
causes the desired action — usually turning the page on the Kindle 
Paperwhite. (In addition, the Kindle Paperwhite has a multitouch 
capacitive screen, which is why you can use two fingers to enlarge 
the font.) Although a stylus will work on a capacitive screen, a 
gloved finger will not.
Chargers and cables
Although the Kindle Paperwhite is advertised as having a very 
long battery life — up to two months if you only read 30 minutes 
per day with minimal wireless use and the light set at 10 — it still 
needs to be charged periodically.
The device ships with a USB cable that can be used for charging 
via a laptop or a computer. Simply connect the USB cable to the 
Paperwhite with the micro-USB adapter and then connect the other 
end of the cable to the computer. If you want to read the device 
while it is charging, eject it from the computer (but leave it physi­
cally attached). Instructions for how to do this are presented 
in Chapter 2.
The device doesn’t ship with a plug adapter, but you can purchase 
one from Amazon for $9.99 (5 watts) or $19.99 (9 watts) or use one 
from an earlier model Kindle (Kindle 2 or Kindle Keyboard). You 
can also use a micro-USB plug adapter from another device, such 
as a BlackBerry.
	
The 9-watt charger is designed for the Kindle Fire but is approved 
for use in the Kindle Paperwhite. If you use this charger, the Kindle 
Paperwhite will charge completely in four hours or less.
Although the cable alone is sufficient, having a backup is a good 
idea, especially if you’re prone to misplacing things. The complete 
unit — cable and plug — costs $25. The cable alone is $10.

 Chapter 10: Accessorizing 159
	
Amazon sells plug adapters that work in the United Kingdom (Type 
G, UK), the European Union (EU Universal), and Australia (Type 
I, AU). If you regularly travel to any of these countries, buying an 
adapter specific for that region might be a worthwhile investment.
If you spend a lot of time in your car, consider a charger that plugs 
into the vehicle’s power source/cigarette lighter. A variety of adapt­
ers that work with the Kindle Paperwhite are sold on Amazon.
Stands
Although the Kindle Paperwhite is light and easy to hold, some­
times you want to have your hands free while reading. In that case, 
you might find a stand to be a useful accessory. Amazon makes a 
basic minitravel stand that folds up and snaps shut when not in 
use. It’s made of black plastic with rubber coated ends for stability. 
Learn more at www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064EL2DK/.
BoxWave (www.boxwave.com) has two versions of easel-type 
bamboo devices: the stand and the panel. The stand is small, 
lightweight, and portable, whereas the panel separates into 
two pieces for storage. Note that BoxWave ships worldwide.
The Peeramid Pillow was designed by two sisters who wanted to 
bring comfortable reading to the world. Place the pyramid-shaped 
pillow on your lap, and fit the Kindle Paperwhite in the lip at the 
bottom of the pillow. When not in use, the pillow can be disguised 
as a traditional throw cushion on a couch or chair. Peeramid 
Pillows are sold in a variety of colors and fabric designs at Amazon 
(search for Peeramid Pillow).
Insuring Your Kindle Paperwhite
The Kindle Paperwhite comes with a one-year manufacturer’s 
warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship. 
Amazon also sells an extended warranty that covers the device 
for two full years, including damage caused from dropping it. The 
warranty, which is administered by SquareTrade, stays with the 
device even if you sell it or give it to someone, must be purchased 
within 30 days of purchasing your Kindle Paperwhite, and is 
available only to customers in the United States.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
160
For details on the two-year warranty plan, tap the link on the right 
side of the main product page for the Kindle Paperwhite.
	
If your Kindle Paperwhite breaks and needs to be exchanged, 
return only the Kindle Paperwhite — don’t send the USB cable. 
You’ll receive another cable with your replacement.

M

ost people find that their Kindle Paperwhite is a reliable, 
problem-free device. For the infrequent occasions when 
glitches occur, they’re usually resolved easily. In this chapter, I 
show you some troubleshooting tips that solve the most common 
difficulties encountered by Kindle Paperwhite owners.
For other, more complex, problems, I provide some steps you can 
take to solve them. First, though, I point you to ways you can get 
help from online resources, from other Kindle Paperwhite owners, 
and from Amazon’s Kindle customer service.
Getting Help Online
Many Kindle owners join user forums, where a wide variety of 
problems can be addressed by helpful forum members. Amazon 
has a Kindle product forum that covers Kindle Paperwhite and all 
its e-reader devices. You can access the forum in several ways. The 
easiest is to go to the main Kindle Store on Amazon and choose 
Discussions, at the top of the page, as shown in Figure 11-1.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
162
Figure 11-1: Accessing the Kindle Discussion forum at Amazon.
To find independent Kindle user forums, use your favorite search 
engine to search for Kindle user forum. Posting your Kindle 
Paperwhite problem in the troubleshooting area of an active forum 
can be an efficient way of resolving perplexing issues. Most forums 
have resident experts who have seen it all and can provide quick 
answers to common questions.
Amazon also provides a Kindle Support page with links to trouble­
shooting tips. Go to the Manage Your Kindle page at www.amazon.
com/myk. (Note that you’ll be prompted to log in to Amazon if 
you aren’t already signed in.) From the Manage Your Kindle page, 
you can access Kindle Support through the Kindle Help link or the 
Kindle Support option, as shown in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2: You can access both Kindle Help and Kindle Support from this page.
	
The Kindle Support page includes a selection of how-to videos. 
From your computer, click the link for Helpful Kindle Support 
Videos and then click the Kindle Paperwhite (second generation) 
image to see the videos available for your device. These short 
videos cover 24 topics, including charging; toolbars and naviga­
tion; troubleshooting Wi-Fi; and syncing. The longest video is just 
over two minutes.

 Chapter 11: Troubleshooting 163
	
Your Kindle Paperwhite comes with the user guide already 
downloaded on the device. You can also download it from the 
Kindle Support page. To download a user guide in German, French, 
Italian, Spanish, Japanese, or Portuguese, go to your library 
through the Manage Your Kindle link (www.amazon.com/myk).
Contacting Amazon Kindle 
Customer Service
Kindle forums are full of appreciative reports about positive 
­experiences with Amazon’s Kindle customer service. These cus­
tomer service representatives have a reputation for quickly resolv­
ing issues and for treating Kindle owners fairly and respectfully.
If your Kindle Paperwhite problem isn’t readily resolved by basic 
troubleshooting steps, your best bet may be contacting customer 
service. More than likely, a ready resolution to your issue is waiting 
on the other end of the telephone line. The direct toll-free number 
for Kindle customer service is 1-866-321-8851. Customers outside 
the United States should call 1-206-266-0927.
From the Kindle Support page, you can choose to have a customer 
service representative call you. In this way, the representative can 
access your account before making the call, which might speed 
up the support process. You can also e-mail customer service or 
­initiate a chat session from the Kindle Support page. Click the 
Contact Us button on the Kindle Support page to initiate help from 
Amazon by telephone, e-mail, or chat.
Common Problems and Solutions
In the following sections, I provide some of the more common 
problems reported by Kindle Paperwhite owners in community 
forums. For many of these problems, I provide steps for a quick 
resolution.
You see ghost images on the screen
Ghosting is the faint display of text or graphics that remains from 
a previous page even after you page forward.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
164
This phenomenon may seem similar to the burn-in that can occur 
on older computer monitors — in which images of screensavers, for 
example, are permanently branded on the display. Fortunately, the 
e-ink screen doesn’t burn in, and you can safely have your Kindle 
Paperwhite display a page or a screensaver for long periods of time.
If you encounter ghosting of a prior display on your Kindle 
Paperwhite, refresh the screen. To refresh the screen while read­
ing an e-book or other content, tap near the top of the screen 
to display the toolbar, and then tap anywhere on the page. The 
display briefly flashes black as the screen refreshes and the tool­
bar disappears. From the Home screen, opening a book or other 
content causes the page to refresh — you’ll know this is happening 
because the display briefly flashes black.
	
By default, your Kindle Paperwhite does a page refresh of its e-ink 
display every six pages. If you’re experiencing ghosting issues, change 
the setting to have the display refresh with every page turn. Tap 
Menu➪Settings➪Reading Options. Set the Page Refresh option to On.
	
Having the page refresh on every page turn uses more battery power.
The device freezes or is very slow
If your Kindle Paperwhite stops behaving in its usual speedy 
­fashion or freezes, you can typically resolve the problem by doing 
a menu restart or a hard restart.
Begin by performing a menu restart on your Kindle Paperwhite:	
	
1.	Tap Menu➪Settings.
	
2.	Tap Menu➪Restart.
	
	 ( Restart is the third item on the drop-down menu that 
appears.) Your Kindle Paperwhite displays the start-up 
screen and a progress bar. After a minute or so, the device 
restarts and displays the Home screen.
If the menu restart doesn’t resolve the problem, try a hard restart:
	
1.	Press and hold down the power button for 7 to 15 seconds.
	
	 A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
	
2.	Tap Restart.
	
	 The start-up screen appears with a silhouetted child read­
ing under a tree. In a few seconds, the device begins the 
restart process and displays a progress bar. When that 
restart is complete, you see the Home screen.

 Chapter 11: Troubleshooting 165
Figure 11-3: The hard restart menu.
	
Sometimes a low battery can be the cause of unexpected Kindle 
Paperwhite behavior. If you continue to have problems, plug in 
your device to let it charge for at least an hour and then try a menu 
restart again, followed by a hard restart if necessary.
The device is behaving erratically
If your Kindle Paperwhite is exhibiting erratic behavior, such as 
difficulty downloading content or jumping from section to section 
in a book instead of moving smoothly from page to page, try a hard 
restart. Simply follow the directions in the preceding section. A hard 
restart is easy and resolves many glitches.
You can’t connect to Wi-Fi 
automatically
The Kindle Paperwhite automatically scans for Wi-Fi networks that 
are in range of your device. If one (or more) networks are found, 
the device will connect automatically. If a password is required, 
a screen appears asking you to input that information. Generally, 
the process is quick and easy.
Occasionally, however, you may need to connect to the Wi-Fi 
network manually. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap Menu➪Settings.
	
2.	If the network to which you want to connect appears in 
the list, tap that network.
	
	 You’re finished!

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
166
	
3.	If the network to which you want to connect doesn’t 
appear in the list:
	
 a.	 Tap Other (at the bottom of the Wi-Fi Networks box).
	
		
A dialog box named Enter Wi-Fi Network appears, 
along with the on-screen keyboard.
	
 b.	Using the onscreen keyboard, enter the network 
name and, if applicable, the password.
	
 c.	 Tap the Advanced button.
	
 d.	Work through the series of screens, entering 
information related to the network, including 
connection type, IP address, and security type.
	
		
Advance through the screens by using the up and
	
		
down arrows.
	
		
If necessary, contact the person who set up the 
­network for assistance with filling in this information.
	
 e.	 When all the necessary information has been 
entered, tap the Connect button to join the 
­network.
	
If your Kindle Paperwhite is connected to your home network but 
can’t connect to Amazon, you may need to reestablish the connec­
tion. Tap Menu➪Settings➪Wi-Fi Networks, and then tap the net­
work that has a check mark to its left. When the Forget Network? 
dialog box appears, tap Forget. You’ll have to reselect the network 
and enter the password (if one is required).
	
If you’re having trouble connecting to your home network, unplug 
the Wi-Fi router, wait at least 60 seconds, and then plug it in and 
wait for the network to restart.
The battery discharges quickly
Amazon advertises that a single charge of the battery in the 
Kindle Paperwhite should last eight weeks, based on a half-hour 
of ­reading each day with minimal use of the wireless and the light 
set at 10. For voracious readers (like me), that usage is slight. Still, 
the battery should last at least a week or two even with daily usage 
with the wireless turned on.
If you notice that the battery is running down in a short period of 
time (48 to 72 hours), the problem may be due to unindexed ­content. 
Typically, whenever you add content to the Kindle Paperwhite, it 
indexes the material. This allows you to search for words or terms 
both within a specific book as well as across all ­content on the device. 

 Chapter 11: Troubleshooting 167
Occasionally, a book fails to index properly, so the device tries end­
lessly (and unsuccessfully) to index it, causing the battery to run down. 
To determine whether this is the problem, take the following steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, tap the Search icon.
	
2.	Make sure that All Text is displayed to the right of the 
search box.
	
	 If it isn’t, tap the phrase that does appear to open a 
drop-down menu and select All Text — the second 
choice in the list.
	
3.	Type an unusual word or just a string of letters.
	
	 Don’t choose a common word such as man or the.
	
4.	Tap the arrow next to the box to begin the search.
	
5.	Check for unindexed items.
	
	 Look below the list of search results (if any) for Items Not 
Yet Indexed. ( To see what a successful search screen looks 
like, see Chapter 4.) Tap the Items Not Yet Indexed line to 
see the items that haven’t been indexed.
	
6.	If you have an unindexed item, remove it by pressing 
and holding down on it and then selecting Delete from 
the menu that appears.
	
	 If you’ve acquired this content from Amazon, it will be 
available to you for redownloading from the Cloud. For 
other content, make sure you have a backup. Samples from 
Amazon must be redownloaded from the book’s Amazon 
page, so make a note of those before deleting, if you want 
to resample that content.
	
7.	Charge your battery completely.
Make a note of the date and keep track of how long it takes the 
battery to discharge. You may have to wait a few days to see 
whether the battery problem has resolved. When you’ve deter­
mined that the battery is functioning normally, you can put the 
offending (unindexed) items back on your Kindle Paperwhite by 
redownloading from the Cloud, sideloading from your computer, 
or resampling the content from Amazon.
	
If more than one item appeared on the unindexed content list and 
you want to put these items back on your Kindle Paperwhite, add 
them one at a time and wait for each to finish indexing before 
adding the next. In this way, if a problem exists with specific 
content, you can more easily identify which book is the offender.

If you continue to have problems, contact customer service using 
the steps described in the previous section, “Contacting Amazon 
Kindle Customer Service.”
Your Paperwhite doesn’t sync 
among devices
Normally, you can start reading an e-book on one device, such as 
your Kindle Paperwhite, and continue reading from where you left 
off on another device.
Amazon’s Whispersync feature enables you to move seamlessly 
from reading on your Kindle Paperwhite to reading on a smart­
phone or your computer, as shown in Figure 11-4. In addition, 
Whispersync for Voice allows you to sync between your Kindle 
Paperwhite and an Audible version of a book that you listen to on 
your preferred audio device with the Audible app.
Figure 11-4: The Sync screen between a Paperwhite and an iPhone.
When opening the e-book on the other device, you’re typically 
prompted with the option to move to the furthest location read 
(refer to Figure 11-4). If this doesn’t happen, check the following:
	
✓	Connection to Amazon’s servers: For Whispersync to work, 
the devices must be connected to Amazon’s servers. Ensure 
that your Kindle Paperwhite or other device has Wi-Fi or 3G 
connectivity when syncing.
	
✓	Synchronization setting: If your devices are connected to 
Amazon’s servers and synchronization still isn’t working, 
check your synchronization settings. Log in to Amazon and 
go to the Manage Your Kindle page (www.amazon.com/myk). 

 Chapter 11: Troubleshooting 169
Look at the left column and scroll down to the Whispersync 
Device Synchronization link. Choose that link, and verify that 
the Synchronization option is set to On.
	
	The Synchronization setting affects all devices and all con­
tent associated with your account; you can’t selectively turn 
Device Synchronization on or off for a particular device or 
for a particular e-book. If you have multiple Kindles on your 
account (for example, Kindles that belong to you, your spouse, 
and your children) and everyone is reading the same e-book, 
the Kindle synchronizes to the last page read for everyone. In 
this case, you may want to turn off synchronization.
You can reset the last page read from Your Kindle Library at Manage 
Your Kindle. Next to the appropriate title, click the Actions box. From 
the drop-down menu that appears, select Clear Furthest Page Read.
	
If your device is still having synchronization problems, try exiting 
the book to the Home screen — rather than leaving the book open 
when the Kindle Paperwhite goes into Sleep mode.
An e-book won’t open or 
stops responding
If your Kindle Paperwhite freezes or starts behaving strangely when 
you’re reading a particular e-book or other content, try a menu 
restart and then, if necessary, a hard restart. For directions, see 
“The device freezes or is very slow” section, earlier in this chapter.
If those solutions don’t work, the file might be corrupted and 
removing the item might solve the problem. However, if the book 
came from a source other than Amazon, you should have a backup 
before deleting it from your Kindle Paperwhite. If you bought the 
book from Amazon, it will be stored in the Cloud and you can 
redownload it to your device.
Remove the item and then restart your Kindle Paperwhite by fol­
lowing these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, tap and hold down on the item.
	
	 A pop-up menu appears, with several options.
	
2.	Tap the Remove from Device option or, for samples, the 
Delete This Sample option.
	
	 The e-book or sample is removed from your Kindle 
Paperwhite.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
170
	
3.	Restart your Kindle Paperwhite by pressing and holding 
the power button for 7–15 seconds and tapping Restart 
on the pop-up menu that appears.
Try reading other content to see whether the symptoms have 
cleared up. If so, you can try downloading the e-book again from 
Amazon by selecting it from the Cloud on your Home screen or 
sideloading it to your device from your computer. If none of these 
steps work, contact customer service using the steps described 
in the previous section, “Contacting Amazon Kindle Customer 
Service.”
A downloaded item doesn’t appear 
on the Home screen
At times, an item you’ve downloaded wirelessly or transferred 
by USB to your Kindle Paperwhite doesn’t appear on your Home 
screen. Usually the Kindle Paperwhite refreshes its content list­
ing immediately when new content is added. But if that doesn’t 
happen, tap Menu from the Home screen and then tap Sync 
and Check for Items. If that doesn’t work, try a menu restart, as 
described in “The device freezes or is very slow” section, earlier 
in this chapter. This action forces your Kindle to refresh its 
content listing.
	
If you’ve transferred content to your Kindle via USB, make sure 
the content is in the Documents folder on your device. If you’ve 
inadvertently placed an e-book in the root directory, it won’t 
appear on your Home screen.
The Home screen displays items 
out of order
You can display items on your Home screen by Recent, Title, 
Author, or Collections. Occasionally, items aren’t displayed in 
the correct order.
To resolve this problem, do a quick resync:
	
1.	From the Home screen, tap the Menu icon.
	
2.	Tap Sync and Check for Items.
	
	 Sync and Check for Items is the fourth option on the 
drop-down menu. Your Home screen displays items 
in proper order.

 Chapter 11: Troubleshooting 171
	
Make sure the clock on your Kindle Paperwhite is set to the 
correct time. If the clock is not accurate, the device will not 
sync properly, resulting in a Home page with books not listed 
in the proper order. To set the time, tap Menu➪Settings➪Device 
Options➪Device Time.
You can set the Kindle Paperwhite 3G to update the clock automat­
ically. On a Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite, you must set the clock 
manually. Keep this fact in mind when traveling or if you live in an 
area with daylight saving time.
The device doesn’t recognize 
your password
You can use a password to protect access to your Kindle 
Paperwhite. If the password that you set for your device isn’t 
working, you have some troubleshooting options:
	
✓	Be sure you enter the password correctly.
	
✓	Try some variations of the password. Maybe you mistyped it 
(twice) when you originally set it up.
	
✓	If you have more than one Kindle in your household, make 
sure you enter the password on the right device. Sorry, 
I have to include this one!
I hope one of these troubleshooting steps helps because the next 
remedy — resetting your password — is drastic. This solution 
wipes all content from your Kindle Paperwhite and deregisters it 
from Amazon. Reinstalling all your books, personal documents, 
and collection can be done, but it takes time.
To reset your password, type 111222777 in the Password field and 
then tap OK. Your Kindle is wiped clean. You now have to register 
the device again with Amazon (as detailed in Chapter 2) and down­
load content again as desired from your Amazon archive, either by 
using the Cloud or pushing content to your Kindle Paperwhite 
(see Chapter 5).
An e-book you purchased hasn’t 
downloaded from the Kindle Store
You’ve purchased an e-book — or some other content — from 
the Kindle Store, and it hasn’t appeared on your Home screen. 
Or perhaps your subscription content doesn’t load automatically.

Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
172
If you don’t see content that should be downloaded, try these tips:
	
✓	If you have a Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite, make sure it’s 
connected to a Wi-Fi network. If it is, you’ll see the Wi-Fi 
indicator in the top-right corner of the Home screen. The 
device must be connected to Wi-Fi to download e-books 
and other content from the Kindle Store.
	
✓	If you have a Kindle Paperwhite 3G, ensure that it’s either 
connected to a Wi-Fi network or in a 3G coverage area. The 
bars at the top of the Home screen indicate the strength of the 
3G signal. If the 3G signal is weak (two bars or less), Kindle 
Store connectivity may be slow or disrupted.
	
	
	If your Kindle Paperwhite is adequately connected via Wi-Fi 
or 3G but you’re still having trouble downloading content, 
try this: From the Home screen, tap the Menu icon and select 
Sync and Check for Items.
	
✓	Ensure that the battery is charged sufficiently. When the 
battery level is low, connectivity may be affected. If the 
battery charge meter, which is displayed in the top-right 
corner of the Home screen, is less than 25 percent, plug in 
your Kindle Paperwhite and let it charge for a few hours.
	
✓	Make sure the e-book is in your library at Amazon. When 
you make a purchase, you receive a confirmation e-mail from 
Amazon. If you don’t receive the e-mail and the book doesn’t 
appear in your library, you may not have successfully com­
pleted the purchase. In that case, buy the book again. If the 
problem persists, contact customer service (see “Contacting 
Amazon Kindle Customer Service,” earlier in the chapter).
	
If you can’t find a book, make sure it isn’t somewhere unexpected 
on your Kindle. Change the sort order to By Author or Recent. If 
you are redownloading a book that was previously placed in a 
collection on your Kindle Paperwhite, it will redownload to that 
collection.
	
Another reason why an e-book might not download to your Kindle 
is a problem or delay with Amazon’s servers. Try waiting for a few 
hours and see whether the e-book downloads eventually.

 Chapter 11: Troubleshooting 173
What to Do as a Last Resort
If all else fails, you can reset your Kindle Paperwhite back to 
factory specifications.
	
A factory reset is also a way to wipe your Kindle Paperwhite clean 
if you ever decide to give it as a gift or sell it.
	 Resetting your Kindle Paperwhite is a last-resort step. Before you 
carry out a factory reset, try the more common and less drastic 
fixes described in the “Common Problems and Solutions” section, 
earlier in this chapter. Also, consider calling Amazon Kindle 
customer service before undertaking a factory reset on your 
own. (See “Contacting Amazon Kindle Customer Service,” earlier 
in the chapter.)
To reset your Kindle Paperwhite to its original out-of-the-box state, 
follow these steps:	
	
1.	Tap Menu➪Settings.
	
2.	Tap Menu➪>Reset Device.
	
3.	When you see the warning, tap Yes. (To back out without 
resetting, you’d tap No.)
	
	 Your Kindle Paperwhite resets. You have to re-register the 
device with Amazon and download your Kindle e-books 
and other content from the Cloud at your Amazon account. 
You also need to retransfer any personal documents that 
you’ve loaded on your Kindle Paperwhite from your 
computer.
	
Personal documents that you have sent to your Kindle Paperwhite 
via e-mail are stored in the Cloud at your Amazon account. You can 
transfer these documents to your Kindle Paperwhite just like any 
other content stored in the Cloud.
	
If you have a Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite, be sure to have the Wi-Fi 
password for your router. You’ll need that password to connect the 
device to the wireless service. Without a Wi-Fi or 3G connection, 
you won’t be able to transfer content.

n trademark For Dummies style, this chapter contains ten 
tips to make your Kindle Paperwhite more useful. These 
concise and easy-to-digest tips can benefit power users and 
casual readers alike.
Be a Bargain Hunter
Many people ask if you can buy an e-book version of a previously 
purchased printed book for free or for a reduced price. Until 
November 2013, the answer to that question was no — but then 
Amazon introduced Kindle Matchbook. This program allows you 
to buy e-books of print books you’ve previously purchased on 
Amazon. (Not all books are in the program.) If you’ve been a loyal 
Amazon customer, you probably have many books on your shelf 
that will qualify for this program.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
176
You can search for other bargains in addition to Matchbook. 
Amazon has a Daily Deal, where you can buy current popular 
books at deeply discounted prices, often $1.99 or less. These 
deals last only a day, so make sure to take advantage of them 
when you see ones you want.
To find out about free books, peruse the Top 100 Free Books at the 
main page of the Kindle Store. This list is updated hourly and new free 
books appear on a regular basis, so be sure to check the list often.
Kindle First is another program that allows you to get one new 
release per month for $1.99 or free for Amazon Prime customers. 
You may choose from four books selected from Amazon Editions. 
To find out more, go to www.amazon.com/gp/digital/kindle/
botm/?tag=viglink126429-20. Sign up for the monthly 
newsletter to be alerted to the choices on the first of the month.
Whispersync for Voice allows you to read a Kindle Paperwhite 
book and listen to an Audible book at the same time. When you 
switch between devices, you can pick up where you left off in 
the other version. Many Audible books are offered at discounted 
prices if you own the Kindle version, often $3.95 or less (the usual 
price is generally over $20). If the Audible version is available at a 
reduced price, it will say so on the Kindle version’s product page.
Personalize Your Device
Make your Kindle Paperwhite unique. Here are two tips to personalize 
your Kindle Paperwhite so that everyone knows it’s yours:
	
✓	Name your device. Give your Kindle Paperwhite a special 
name that reflects your — and its — personality. Perhaps you 
want to give your Kindle Paperwhite a character’s name from 
a favorite book, a name you love (or even wish you had), or 
a meaningful phrase. I know of a Kindle Paperwhite named 
Catalyst because it’s a catalyst for reading. To change the 
device name, tap Menu➪Settings to display Device Options, 
and make your change. You can name your device also on 
Amazon’s Manage Your Kindle area (www.amazon.com/myk).
	
✓	Change the font and font size. The Kindle Paperwhite has 
six fonts. Play around with them to find the one that’s most 
comfortable for your eyes. Note: You have to be in an e-book 
(or other content) to choose the font options. While reading 
a book, tap the top region of the screen to display the toolbar. 
Tap the Text (Aa) icon, on the left of the toolbar, and then tap 
through the eight font sizes, six fonts (Baskerville, Caecilia, 
Caecilia Condensed, Futura, Helvetica, and Palatino), line 
spacing, and margins. (See Chapter 2 for details.)

 Chapter 12: Ten Helpful Kindle Paperwhite Tips 177
Be Clever with Collections
Many readers organize their Kindle Paperwhite e-books into 
collections so that they can quickly find their favorites among 
the dozens — or even hundreds — of books stored on the device. 
Although names such as Bestsellers and Finished are serviceable, 
why not have some fun? Here are a few suggestions culled from 
Kindle users:
	
✓	Once Upon a Time (young adult/children)
	
✓	Books that Make Me Look Smart (classics)
	
✓	Small Servings (samples)
	
✓	On the Nightstand (currently reading)
	
✓	On the Docket (coming up next)
	
✓	What Was I Thinking? DNF (did not finish)
	
✓	Maybe Someday (all unread books)
	
✓	Can’t Resist a Bargain (cheap or freebies)
	
✓	Tell Me about Your Life (autobiographies and biographies)
	
✓	A Blast from the Past (historical fiction)
	
✓	Magic and Mayhem (fantasy and paranormal)
	
✓	Future Bestsellers (books from indie authors)
	
✓	Extra! Extra! (subscription content, such as newspapers 
and magazines)
	
✓	Let’s Eat! (cookbooks)
	
✓	Technical Manuals (guilty pleasures and erotica)
Have Fun with Words
Here are a few tips for having fun with words on your Kindle 
Paperwhite:
	
✓	Use the dictionary to look up unfamiliar words. Simply press 
and hold down on a word. The dictionary definition appears 
automatically.
	
✓	Share new words on Facebook or Twitter. From the dictionary 
definition, tap More, tap Share, add a note, and tap Share. The 
information will be posted to your Facebook page and Twitter 
feed. A notation (superscripted number) will also be linked to 
the passage on your Kindle Paperwhite.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
178
	
✓	Translate words into another language. The Kindle 
Paperwhite allows you to translate words (and phrases) into 
sixteen languages, including Chinese (simplified and tradi­
tional), Hindi, and Russian. Press and hold down on the word. 
From the dictionary definition page, tap More, and then tap 
Translation. On the screen that appears, tap To: English to see 
the list of languages and choose one. (To see the entire list, 
drag it up and down with your finger.)
	
✓	Translate words into English. Are you reading a book that 
contains words or phrases in another language? You can 
translate them to English. The Kindle Paperwhite will even 
detect the source language!
	
✓	Use Vocabulary Builder to learn new words. Every word 
you look up in the dictionary is added to a list in Vocabulary 
Builder. Tap Vocabulary Builder from the Home screen to 
access the list. For each word, its dictionary definition and 
usage will be displayed. After you’ve committed a word to 
memory, tap Mastered to remove it from the list.
	
✓	Play Every Word. Every Word is a fun word-building game 
designed for the Kindle and available for free from Amazon.
Keep Your Device Safe
The following list provides tips for keeping your Kindle Paperwhite 
safe and in working order:
	
✓	Don’t drop the device. A drop from just a few feet can be 
enough to destroy the screen. Treat the device carefully and 
try to prevent drops.
	
✓	Keep the device away from water. The Kindle Paperwhite 
and water don’t mix. A spill into the tub or pool is a sure way 
to turn your Kindle Paperwhite into a paperweight. If you 
want to use your Kindle Paperwhite in watery environments, 
protect it. Many users report that heavy duty Ziploc bags 
work well. Others opt for custom waterproof jackets, such 
as those sold by M-Edge. (See Chapter 10 for details.) Even 
with protection, however, the device can be damaged if an 
accident occurs.
	
✓	Keep the device clean. Sand or dust can damage the internal 
circuitry and make your Kindle Paperwhite unusable. If you 
opt to read at the beach or the Mojave, protect your Kindle 
Paperwhite with a bag or a plastic jacket. A can of compressed 
air is great for getting dust out of the corners of your Kindle 
Paperwhite, too.

 Chapter 12: Ten Helpful Kindle Paperwhite Tips 179
	
✓	Don’t use, store, or charge the device in extreme tempera­
tures. By extreme, I mean below 32°F or above 95°F (0°C to 
35°C). Outside these temperatures, the e-ink display might 
become damaged. If you’re waiting on an elevated platform on 
a frigidly cold day in Chicago, keep your Kindle Paperwhite in 
your briefcase, warm and protected.
	
✓	Keep the device in a cover, sleeve, or jacket. Even if you 
prefer to hold the Kindle Paperwhite without a cover for 
reading, keep it covered when you’re not using it to protect 
the screen. You can find many attractive covers, sleeves, 
and jackets from simple to fashion-forward, from inex­
pensive to pricey. To keep your Kindle Paperwhite safe, 
consider this important investment. See Chapter 10 for 
accessories.
	
✓	Don’t let young children handle the device. Many people 
ask, “How old does a child need to be to use a Kindle 
Paperwhite?” If children are old enough to read books with 
chapters, they’re probably old enough to handle a Kindle 
Paperwhite with minimal supervision. Children younger 
than 5 might not understand that the Kindle Paperwhite 
is delicate and needs to be treated gently. To be on the 
safe side, keep your Kindle Paperwhite out of their hands 
completely.
	
✓	Protect your Kindle Paperwhite from your pets. Keep your 
device safe from canine and feline friends. I’ve heard of dogs 
chewing a Kindle Paperwhite to pieces and cats walking 
across — and cracking — the screen.
	
✓	Don’t leave your Kindle Paperwhite on a chair or bed. It’s 
easy to sit on your Kindle Paperwhite, roll over on it, or put 
your elbow through the display.
Fly with Your Kindle Paperwhite
The Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect traveling companion, helping 
you get through hours of waiting in airports. And for those people 
who catch up on overdue reading during their vacation, the Kindle 
Paperwhite is ideal.
The following tips will help make your trips smooth and trouble-free:
	
✓	Use common sense for airport security and screening. Take 
the Kindle Paperwhite out of your bag or carry-on and put it 
in the screening bin, along with your cellphone and any other 

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
180
electronic devices. The Kindle Paperwhite needs to be turned 
off, the wireless needs to be turned off, and the device must be 
in Airplane mode (see Chapter 2). Many ask if x-ray screening 
can damage a Kindle; I’ve traveled with my Paperwhite through­
out the United States and abroad without any problems.
	
✓	Don’t leave your Kindle Paperwhite in the seat pocket of the 
plane. In every sad story I’ve heard of a Kindle left on a plane, 
it was left in the seat pocket. Don’t tempt fate. Keep your 
Kindle Paperwhite in your purse, briefcase, backpack, 
or carry-on when you aren’t reading it.
	
✓	If you are requested to do so, turn off the Kindle 
Paperwhite during takeoff and landing. In the eyes of the 
FAA, the Kindle Paperwhite is a portable electronic device 
and must be turned off (not just in Sleep mode) for takeoff 
and landing. To turn off the device, press down on the power 
button for 7–15 seconds and choose the Screen Off option 
in the menu that appears. Then, when the announcement is 
made that it’s safe to use portable electronic devices, you 
can take out your Kindle Paperwhite, tap Menu➪Settings, and 
then toggle Airplane mode to On.
	
	Until November 2013, airline passengers were required 
to turn off their Kindles (all models, including the Kindle 
Paperwhite) during takeoff and landing and any time the 
plane was flying at less than 10,000 feet. However, the FAA 
has recently amended its rules to expand the use of personal 
electronic devices during all phases of a flight — they hope to 
provide passengers with a “gate-to-gate” reading, gaming, and 
video-watching experience. Each airline carrier will be able to 
decide individually how to implement these new rules. As a 
result, things will be “up in the air” for several months as air­
lines decide how to proceed. Listen carefully to all announce­
ments from the flight attendants and pilot and, if required, 
turn off your Kindle during takeoff and landing.
	
✓	Never turn on 3G on airplane. Even though you can read a 
Kindle Paperwhite while flying, 3G (if your Kindle Paperwhite 
is so equipped) must be turned off, as with a cellphone. If the 
airline provides in-flight Wi-Fi, you can turn on the wireless on 
a Wi-Fi–only Kindle Paperwhite when the flight attendant or 
pilot allows it.
	
✓	Make sure you have the proper charging equipment when 
traveling. The Kindle Paperwhite ships with only a USB cord. 
You can use this to charge your device from your computer, 
but it’s a good idea to have a plug adapter, too, so you don’t 
rely on only one charging option. If you’re traveling outside 
the United States, you’ll need a plug adapter if you want to 
charge your Kindle Paperwhite from an electrical socket. 

 Chapter 12: Ten Helpful Kindle Paperwhite Tips 181
The Kindle Paperwhite is a dual-voltage device, so you do not 
need a converter.
	
	If you regularly travel to the same country, consider buying a 
plug specific to that area. See Chapter 10 for details.
	
✓	Load your Kindle Paperwhite with reading content before 
you leave. The Kindle Paperwhite works internationally, 
so Wi-Fi and 3G should work everywhere. Even so, take some 
time before your trip to dig out e-books from the archive or buy 
some e-books from your wish list. Then while you’re traveling, 
you’ll have dozens of e-books available at your fingertips — 
without worrying about buying or downloading them.
	
	If you’re planning a cruise, realize that Wi-Fi access can 
be expensive, amounting to a surcharge on every Kindle 
Paperwhite e-book you download. Now you have an even more 
compelling reason to load up your device before you leave!
Drive with Your Kindle 
Paperwhite
If you travel a lot by car, consider getting a car charger. Then you 
won’t need to charge your Kindle Paperwhite in a hotel room, 
which means you’ll have less chance of leaving the power cord, 
plug, and even Kindle Paperwhite behind. You can find a variety 
of Kindle Paperwhite–compatible car chargers at different price 
points on Amazon.
If you frequently travel by car, consider getting a Kindle/Audible 
audiobook bundle to use with your preferred audio device. 
Whispersync for Voice makes it easy to listen to a book while 
you’re driving. When the day’s driving is done, you can pick up 
your Kindle Paperwhite and sync to the last place you listened to 
on the audio device.
Troubleshoot Your Device
Having trouble with your Kindle Paperwhite? Following are some of 
the most common resolutions to Kindle Paperwhite issues:
	
✓	Turn your Kindle Paperwhite off and then on again. Many 
Kindle Paperwhite issues will resolve themselves by simply 
cycling your Kindle Paperwhite off and then on. Turn off the 
device by holding down the power button for 7 to 15 seconds 

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
182
and choosing Screen Off from the menu that appears. Then 
turn on your Kindle Paperwhite by pressing and releasing the 
power button.
	
✓	Restart your Kindle Paperwhite using the menu. Try 
restarting your Kindle Paperwhite through the menu 
system. Tap Menu➪Settings➪Menu➪Restart.
	
✓	Perform a hard restart of your Kindle Paperwhite. Hold 
down the power button for 7 to 15 seconds and then choose 
Restart from the menu that appears. You’ll see the Kindle 
logo with a progress bar. When the restart is completed, your 
Home page is displayed on the screen.
	
✓	Make sure your Kindle Paperwhite is fully charged. Many 
users have reported a variety of issues ranging from books 
not downloading to problems with syncing when the battery 
charge drops below 25 percent. If you’re having problems and 
the battery indicator is low, plug in your Kindle Paperwhite 
and let it recharge to full strength.
	
✓	Contact customer service. Amazon provides fantastic cus­
tomer service for its entire family of Kindle devices. If the 
preceding tips haven’t solved your problem, call customer 
service at their direct toll-free number: 1-866-321-8851 (in the 
United States). U.S. Amazon customers traveling outside the 
United States should call 1-206-266-0927. You can also e-mail 
customer service or chat online with a customer service rep­
resentative. Go to the Kindle support page at www.amazon.
com/gp/help/contact-us/kindle-help.html? for the 
necessary links, including information for non-U.S. customers.
Give Great Gifts
You love your Kindle Paperwhite and so does your best friend. So 
what do you get your friend for a gift? An Amazon gift card or e-book!
You can send an electronic Amazon gift card in any amount up 
to $2,000. You can select a design that’s specific to the Kindle 
Paperwhite or a design that reflects the season or occasion. Log 
in to your Amazon account and click Purchase a Gift Card to get 
started. To give a Kindle Paperwhite e-book as a gift, search the 
Kindle Store for one; then select the Give as a Gift option on the 
purchase page and go from there. You need to know the recipient’s 
e-mail address to complete either transaction.
Another great gift is a 3-, 6-, or 12-month membership at 
Audible.com. A membership allows your recipient to buy audio­
books and synchronize them between an audio device and the 

 Chapter 12: Ten Helpful Kindle Paperwhite Tips 183
Kindle Paperwhite for a combined reading and listening experi­
ence. To find out more, visit the Gift Center at www.audible.com.
Following are some other great gifts for fellow Kindle Paperwhite 
owners.
	
✓	A plug adapter (the device ships with only a USB cord)
	
✓	An extra USB cord
	
✓	A cover, sleeve, jacket, or skin
	
✓	A capacitive stylus to use on the touchscreen
For more information on all these, see Chapter 10.
Convert a Friend
Most people who experience a Kindle Paperwhite become quite 
enamored with it and, as a result, want to convert their friends and 
relatives. Consider the following when trying to help a non-Kindle 
Paperwhite user see the light:
	
✓	The Kindle app can be used on a computer, an iPad, or a 
smartphone. The Kindle application is free, and versions are 
available for a computer as well as BlackBerry, Android, iPad, 
and iPhone devices. Reading Kindle e-books on a device with 
the Kindle app is a good first step to understanding the Kindle 
Paperwhite experience. With the app, a user can buy e-books 
from Amazon and create an archive of titles. (Realize that with 
the app, you’ll be reading on a device with an LCD screen. You 
need to have a Kindle Paperwhite or other Kindle e-reader if you 
want the e-ink experience.) If the user gets a Kindle Paperwhite, 
the e-books in the archive are available for downloading to the 
device. In addition, the app synchronizes among devices, so if 
you read a few pages on, say, your iPhone and then switch to 
the Kindle Paperwhite, it synchronizes to the last page read.
	
✓	The Kindle Paperwhite is environmentally friendly. Printed 
books require paper for printing, packaging for shipping, 
and trucks for hauling, which are all valuable resources that 
cost money and are potentially harmful to the environment. 
E-books, which consume a few electrons and are delivered via 
wireless, are an ecologically wise choice for reading.
	
✓	The Kindle Paperwhite is hypoallergenic. Some people are 
allergic to the ink used in printed books. Over time, printed 
books can become dirty or infested with dust mites, which 
are also potent allergens. E-books have no such irritants, so 
they’re a good choice for readers with allergies.

 Kindle Paperwhite For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
184
	
✓	A Kindle Paperwhite can help decrease clutter and save 
space. Face it, books take up a lot of room in your home. You 
can store an entire library (1,100 e-books) in a device that you 
can hold in your hand. Plus, you can store thousands more 
books in the Cloud.
	
✓	A Kindle Paperwhite library can never be destroyed in a 
fire or flood. Although a Kindle Paperwhite might break or 
become damaged, your Kindle Paperwhite library, stored in 
the Cloud at your Amazon account, will always be available.
	
✓	You can save money on e-book purchases. A Kindle 
Paperwhite requires an initial investment, but e-books are 
generally less expensive than their printed counterparts. In 
addition, you can find many sources of free e-books as well as 
frequent free e-book promotions.
	
✓	You can change the font size, making reading easier. After 
you discover the convenience of enlarging or reducing the font 
to accommodate your eyes or the lighting conditions, you’ll 
realize the inconvenience of reading very small print. Many 
people with vision problems have been able to regain their joy 
of reading by using the Kindle Paperwhite with enlarged fonts.
	
✓	You can make annotations without harming the e-book. The 
Kindle Paperwhite allows you to make notes, highlight pas­
sages, and annotate important sections, all without leaving 
permanent marks in the book. This is good for the e-book and 
good for other readers, who may be interested in the content 
but not in your notes.
	
✓	Share your reading accomplishments. Use social media, such 
as Goodreads, Facebook, and Twitter, to share your reviews 
and ratings of the books you read, right from the book.
	
✓	Improve your vocabulary by using the dictionary to look up 
unfamiliar words. When you were learning to read, you might 
have looked up words you didn’t know in the dictionary. But 
as you got older, you might have left that habit behind. The 
Kindle Paperwhite makes looking up unfamiliar words easy. 
Instead of trying to puzzle out what unctuous means, look it 
up! (By the way, unctuous means smooth and greasy in texture 
or appearance.)
	
✓	Keep your reading list private. You might not want others 
to know that you’re reading The Bald Duke’s Secret Mistress. 
Everyone has guilty pleasures — is it really anyone else’s 
business that you like to read bodice rippers or trashy 
celebrity biographies?

Leslie H. Nicoll, Ph.D., is a wife, mother, and nurse, as well as a life­
long voracious reader. She purchased her first Kindle in April 2008 
at the urging of her daughter, Hannah. The plan was that they would 
share the device, but within a week, Leslie realized the futility of 
that idea and was quickly placing an order for a second Kindle. 
Leslie has never been one to do things halfway and quickly threw 
herself into learning everything she could about the Kindle — and 
helping others do the same. For many months, she informally main­
tained “The Amazon Kindle FAQ” at the Amazon Kindle forum. In 
September 2008, she pulled the questions and answers together 
and published the information as a Kindle book. In November 2008, 
it became the number-one-selling how-to guide on Amazon.
This book is the fourth For Dummies book that Leslie has authored; 
in addition, she has written extensively for professional nursing 
literature with a resume that boasts books, book chapters, and 
more than 120 peer-reviewed articles. She is the Editor-in-Chief of 
CIN: Computers, Informatics, Nursing, the leading nursing informatics 
journal in the world. She provides leadership to the International 
Academy of Nursing Editors and is currently planning the 2014 con­
ference, which will be held in Portland, ME. When she has time to 
do so, Leslie writes fiction under the pen name E.N. Holland.
Dedication
I dedicate this book to my former coauthor, Harvey Chute, who 
introduced me to the world of writing For Dummies. Harvey 
has moved on to other projects and is no longer writing with me, 
but I am grateful for his mentorship and support, both past 
and present.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I want to thank the community of people I have met through online 
Kindle forums, in particular, KBoards. To be able to interact with a 
community of thousands of folks who share my love of reading is 
truly a wonderful experience. I also want to thank my husband, 
Tony, my children, Lance and Hannah, and my daughter-in-law, 
Jocelyn, for their ongoing love and support.
