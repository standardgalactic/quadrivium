Dubai & Abu Dhabi‚Äôs Highlights
! Dubai Museum
Set in a well-preserved fort, the 
Dubai museum, with its whimsical 
dioramas (below) and fascinating 
displays, provides a comprehensive 
introduction to the city (see pp8‚Äì9). 
@ Dubai Creek
Criss-crossed 
by abras (water 
taxis) and dhows 
(old wooden  
boats) each day, 
this waterway  
(below) is Dubai‚Äôs 
lifeblood        
(see 
pp10‚Äì11). 
¬£ Bastakiya
The gypsum 
and coral courtyard 
houses (left) in this 
quarter were 
constructed by 
Persian merchants 
who settled here 
in the last century 
(see pp12‚Äì13). 
$ Jumeirah 
Mosque
Not only is this 
mosque (right) 
Dubai‚Äôs most 
beautiful, it‚Äôs the 
only mosque open 
to non-Muslims. A 
guided visit to learn 
about Islam and 
culture is a must 
(see pp14‚Äì15). 
% Burj Al Arab
This iconic, attention-
grabbing hotel (above) is 
certainly a sight you cannot 
miss. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs 
tallest, all-suite hotel 
building (see pp16‚Äì17).
The Arabian emirates of Dubai and Abu 
Dhabi, the richest and most powerful of 
the seven city-states that make up the 
United Arab Emirates, offer the best of 
East and West ‚Äì Arab culture, Bedouin 
heritage and Islamic architecture, along-
side excellent shopping, sophisticated 
dining and luxurious hotels. Dubai is 
divided by its bustling Creek and skirted 
with white sand beaches, while Abu 
Dhabi is situated on a splendid Corniche.

To enjoy the highlights at a more relaxed pace, spend a few days 
in Dubai, a day or two in Abu Dhabi and a day in the desert.

^ Madinat Jumeirah (Dubai)
Shop for handicrafts, dine at a waterfront 
restaurant, see theatre or sip a cocktail as you enjoy 
the sunset at this Arabian-themed souq, enter-
tainment and hotel complex (see pp18‚Äì19). 
& Dubai Souqs
Bargain for gold, perfume,  
spices and textiles, or simply 
take in the heady atmosphere of 
Dubai‚Äôs souqs (see pp20‚Äì21). 
) Desert Escapes
A visit to the UAE is incomplete without 
a desert experience. Stay at enchanting 
desert resorts Al Maha or Bab Al Shams  
or take a fun desert safari (see pp26‚Äì7). 
(  Abu Dhabi Authority for 
Culture and Heritage
Enjoy the tranquil palm-shaded 
gardens of Abu Dhabi‚Äôs elegant 
white fort palace (above) before 
taking in the handicraft displays 
and art shows on Emirati culture 
at the Authority for Culture and 
Heritage (see pp24‚Äì5). 
Emirates 
Palace
The jaw-dropping 
display of gold lining 
the walls (right) and 
Swarovski crystals 
dripping from the 
chandeliers at Abu 
Dhabi‚Äôs Emirates 
Palace hotel make 
for an impressive 
sight (see pp22‚Äì3).

Bedouin wax Ô¨Ågures
Dubai Museum
A visit to Dubai would be incomplete without a 
tour of this cleverly-planned museum. It offers a 
vivid picture of how Dubai has crammed into a 
third of a century what most cities achieve in 
several. Located near the creekside historic 
Bastakiya district, the museum is housed within 
and beneath one of the city‚Äôs oldest buildings,  
Al Fahidi Fort. It traces the city‚Äôs meteoric 
development from small desert settlement to 
centre of the Arabian world for commerce, 
finance and tourism. Visit here to gain a sensory 
insight into traditions past and present.

¬£ Bedouin Traditions 
Display
A gallery displays the 
costumes, jewellery, 
weapons and tools of the 
Bedouin people. A holo-
graphic video presentation 
of a tribe performing the 
ceremonial sword dance, 
the Ardah, is hypnotic. 
! Al Fahidi Fort
Originally built in 1787, 
this fort, with its magni-
Ô¨Åcent watch tower, was 
constructed to defend the 
Emiratis against invasion. 
Renovated in 1971, it now 
serves as a city museum. 
$ Multimedia 
Presentation
A 10-minute Ô¨Ålm 
presentation, with 
archive footage, explains 
the development of 
modern Dubai from 1960 
onward. The Ô¨Ålm takes 
you through a pictorial 
tour of Dubai‚Äôs trans-
formation over 40 years, 
decade-by-decade.
A souvenir area sells 
traditional Bedouin 
artefacts, but it‚Äôs 
more fun, and 
cheaper, to bargain in 
the souqs.
After your visit, 
retain the Ô¨Çavour of 
historic Dubai with 
lunch or coffee in  
the shady courtyard 
of nearby Basta  
Art Caf√© (see p71).

Bedouin Culture
Bedu, the Arabic word 
from which the name 
Bedouin is derived, 
means ‚Äúinhabitant of 
the desert‚Äù. Bedouins 
would move from oasis 
to oasis by camel and 
would engage in small-
scale agriculture. The 
hardships of the desert 
have imbued Bedouin 
culture with a strong 
honour code and a 
famous hospitality.
^ Islamic School 
Dioramas
Young Emiratis recite 
the lines of the Koran 
(right) under the eye 
of their tutor in this 
reconstruction of a 
1950‚Äôs school. 
& Desert at Night 
Exhibitions
Learn how animals that 
live in the Arabian desert 
have adapted to cope 
with lack of water, 
extreme temperatures 
and shortage of food.
* Underwater Pearl 
Diving Exhibition
This gallery explains the 
techniques used by pearl 
divers (above) who wore 
nose clips to descend to 
impossible depths. 
( Archaeological  
Finds
Interesting artefacts from 
excavations of graves that 
date back to 
3,000 BC, 
such as Ô¨Åne 
copper and 
alabaster 
objects and 
pottery (left), 
are on display. 
% Old Dubai Souq 
Dioramas
Holographic technology 
combined with waxwork 
Ô¨Ågures (left), smells, 
sounds and archive 
footage transport you 
into the creekside souq 
of half a century ago.
) Wooden Dhow
A traditional Arab 
vessel, the dhow 
(above), is on show at 
the museum‚Äôs exit. 
For celestial navi-
gation, sailors used 
the kamal, a device 
that determines 
latitude using the 
angle of the Pole Star 
above the horizon.

A creek cruise
Dubai Creek
Dubai Creek, fed by the waters of the Arabian Gulf, is the lifeblood of old and 
new Dubai ‚Äì a vibrant mix of the past and the present. The contrast of 
traditional wooden dhows being unloaded at the wharfage against stunning 
modern architecture, such as the glass dome-fronted Bank of Dubai (see 
p61) and the giant ball-topped Etisalat building, is fascinating. The two sides 
of the Creek are Deira (north) and Bur Dubai (south) and a walk along either 
is an enjoyable way to discover this multi-faceted city. Getting across the 
Creek is easy: the nearest bridge for cars is Maktoum Bridge but the cheapest 
and most authentic crossing has to be by abra.

! Abra Trips
Abras are Ô¨Çat-

water taxis (right) and are a 
breezy way to travel. Cram 
in with other passengers ‚Äì 
the abras carry 40,000 
people per day ‚Äì and enjoy 
the great views.
@ Dhows
The dhow is the 
traditional sailing vessel  
of the Emirates. These 
beautiful wooden boats 
(left) are used for tourist 
rides as well as for trade.
¬£ Waterfront Heritage
In the Shindagha area near the Creek mouth you will 
Ô¨Ånd the restored house and museum of the late ruler 
Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum and the Heritage and Diving 
Village (below), which showcases Arabian culture.
By night illuminated 
dhows glide along 
the Creek. 
Stop for a fresh juice 
at the stall at the 
entrance to the 
textile souq.

$ Wharf Walk
It‚Äôs worth 
taking an amble 
alongside the 
colourful painted 
dhows moored on 
the Creek on 
Baniyas Road. 
They arrive each 
day from India, 
Iran and Oman. 
You can wander  
by and watch their 
interesting wares 
being unloaded. 
% Bur Dubai Waterfront
The ruler‚Äôs Diwan and 
historic architecture of ‚ÄúOld 
Dubai‚Äù can be enjoyed from the 
Deira side of the Creek 	BCPWF
: 
windtowers, minarets and the 
domes of the Grand Mosque. 
^ Bait Al Wakeel
Built in 1934, this 
was the Dubai ofÔ¨Åce of 
the British East India 
Company (below). It 
has been completely 
restored and now  
houses a restaurant. 
( Creek Cruises
Several tour 
operators offer creek 
cruises with buffet lunch 
or dinner and enter-
tainment on traditional 
wooden sailing dhows. 
A sunset trip is a treat, 
especially if accompanied 
by live belly-dancing and 
Arabian music. 
) Bateaux Dubai
An evening on the 
Creek aboard the sleek, 
glass-encased Bateaux 
Dubai is a luxurious way 
to enjoy the views. Four-
course dinners, white 
table linen and live piano 
music make this a 
romantic indulgence. 
* Creekside Park
A wonderful expanse 
of parkland, Creekside 
Park (below) stretches 
along the water‚Äôs edge. 
Walk its length and enjoy 
the watery vistas or take 
a fun cable car ride from 
one side of 
the Creek to 
the other.  
& The Diwan
With its modern 
white windtowers 
and imposing 
wrought-iron 
gates, the Diwan, 
or Ruler‚Äôs OfÔ¨Åce, 
is impressive 
(below). 
History of Dubai 
Creek
Once a tiny Ô¨Åshing 
settlement sprawled 
around the palm-fringed 
mouth of the Creek, 
Dibei, as it was known 
in the 16th Century, 
owes its existence to 
the 14-km (9-mile)  
Dubai Creek which led 
into a natural harbour 
and established itself as 
a Ô¨Çourishing hub for 
entrep√¥t trade.

A Bastakiya window
Bastakiya
The old and atmospheric Bastakiya quarter  
has benefited from extensive renovation work  
by Dubai Municipality. It gives a picturesque 
glimpse into the city‚Äôs past in sharp contrast  
to the futuristic architecture and audacious 
construction projects elsewhere. Traditional  
sand, stone, coral and gypsum windtower 
houses, with elegant courtyards, can be  
explored as you wander the maze of shady 
narrow streets and alleys. The buildings have 
been restored to their original state, with 
Arabesque windows, decorative gypsum panels 
and screens. This area is now home to art 
galleries, museums and atmospheric caf√©s.

! Bastakiya History
Bastak, in southern 
Iran, is the origin of the 
name Bastakiya. It was 
traders from Bastak who 
founded this area by the 
Creek in the early 1900s. 
Drawn by Dubai‚Äôs liberal 
tax policies, they settled 
here permanently. 
@ Traditional 
Architecture
The need to remain cool 
prompted the distinctive 
vernacular style of the 
windtower courtyard 
houses (right). Thick walls 
and narrow windows with 
intricate Arabesque 
designs are characteristic.
¬£ Al Fahidi Fort
Now Dubai Museum 
(see pp8‚Äì9), this Fort 
(above) dates back to 1787. 
A sighting recorded in 1822 
calls this ‚Äúa square castel-
lated building, with a tower 
at one angle... with three 
or four guns mounted‚Äù.
$ Old City Wall
Restoration work  
of the original 200-year-old 
city wall (below) has 
reinforced the importance 
of this section of the 
original city as a crucial 
defensive zone. 
Set aside a couple of 
hours to fully see the 
Bastakiya quarter: 
late in the day, the 
golden light and long 
shadows add to the 
atmosphere.
For a light lunch, 
Basta Art Caf√© offers 
healthy options such 
as fresh soups, salad 
and sandwiches.

Established in 1999 to promote understanding of 
traditional Emirati culture and Islam, this centre offers 
walking tours, Arabic courses and cultural awareness 
programmes. The building is a stunning architectural 
example of a courtyard house.

Windtowers
Windtowers were the 
most distinctive 
architectural element of 
Arabic houses in the 
early 20th century. With 
four open sides, each of 
which was hollowed 
into a concave v-shape, 
wind-towers deÔ¨Çected 
the air down, cooling 
the rooms below. Water 
was thrown on the Ô¨Çoor 
beneath the tower to 
cool the house further.

The mosque‚Äôs interiors
Jumeirah Mosque
Dubai‚Äôs culture is rooted in Islam, a fact that touches all aspects of everyday 
life. Virtually every neighbourhood has its own mosque, but the jewel in the 
crown is undoubtedly Jumeirah Mosque. This fine example of modern Islamic 
architecture was built in 1998. It is a dramatic sight set against blue skies 
and especially breathtaking at night, when it is lit up and its artistry is thrown 
into relief. Built of smooth white stone, the mosque, with its elaborately 
decorated twin minarets and majestic dome, is a city landmark and an 
important place of worship.

Architecture
With its vast central dome 
(right), this mosque is 
inspired by the Anatolian 
style. The exterior is 
decorated in geometric 
relief over the stonework. 
¬£ Mihrab
The attractive mihrab ‚Äì 
the niche in the wall of this 
and every mosque that 
indicates the qibla, the 
direction one should face 
when praying ‚Äì gives the 
impression of a door or a 
passage to Mecca (below). 
@ Minarets
Two minarets (above) 
crown this mosque. The 
height of the tallest one ‚Äì 
the highest point of the 
‚ÄúHouse of Allah‚Äù ‚Äì is deter-
mined by how far the call 
to prayer should be heard. 
Opposite the mosque 
is Japengo Caf√©: it‚Äôs 
a pleasant spot for a 
drink or light lunch 
on the terrace. 
The mosque tours 
are intended to help 
visitors gain a real 
understanding of the 
Islamic faith, so make 
the most of the 
question time to Ô¨Ånd

^ Five Pillars of 
Islam
The ‚ÄúFive Pillars of 
Islam‚Äù are: Shahadah, 
the belief in the oneness 
of God; Salat, the Ô¨Åve 
daily prayers; Zakat, 
alms-giving; Siyam, self-
puriÔ¨Åcation and Haj, the 
pilgrimage to Mecca. 
& Prayers
The adhan (call to 
prayer) rings out Ô¨Åve 
times a day ‚Äì all able 
Muslims must supplicate 
themselves (below) to 
Allah by praying on a 
musalla (traditional mat). 
* Ramadan
During the holy 
month of Ramadan, 
Muslims abstain from 
food, drink and other 
physical needs. This is a 
time for puriÔ¨Åcation and 
to focus on Allah. 
( The Haj
Every able-bodied 
Muslim is expected to 
make the annual 
pilgrimage to Mecca, in 
Saudi Arabia, once. Each 
year millions of Muslims 
from all over the globe 
do so to be forgiven of 
sins, to pray and to cele-
brate the glory of Allah. 
) Mosque Etiquette
Dubai may be cosmo-
politan, but in keeping 
with mosque etiquette, 
you must dress conser‚Äì
vatively to enter (right). 
No shorts or sleeveless 
tops for either gender; 
women must wear a 
headscarf. Remove your 
shoes before entering. 
Call to Prayer
Wherever you are in 
Dubai, you are likely to 
be within earshot of a 
mosque and to hear the 
daily calls to prayer 
‚ÄúAllahu akbar‚Äù (God is 
great). Today, the 
modern-day call is 
transmitted through 
loudspeakers; in the 
past the muezzin made 
the call himself.

The shore-facing fa√ßade 
of the Burj is covered by a

woven glass Ô¨Åbre. It is the

has been used in this way 
in any building worldwide.

The interior oozes with 
exotic opulence, from the 
shell-shaped reception 
desk (below) to the gold-
leafed surfaces. The uphol-
stery is a riot of patterns 
and geometric designs.
Burj Al Arab
So recognisable that it instantly became an international symbol for modern 
Dubai, the Burj Al Arab (meaning ‚ÄúArabian tower‚Äù), completed in 1999, is an 
exclusive all-suite hotel. With its helipad on the 28th floor and a restaurant 
seemingly suspended in mid-air, at a soaring 321 m (1,053 ft), it takes the 
trophy for being the world‚Äôs tallest all-suite hotel. Set on its own artificial 
island against the backdrop of the turquoise waters of the Gulf, it is dazzling 
white by day and rainbow-coloured by night when its fa√ßade is used as a 
canvas for spectacular light displays.

The spirit of old Arabia is the inspiration for Madinat Jumeirah, an 
extravagant complex located on the beachfront comprising two luxury hotels,  
Al Qasr and Mina A‚ÄôSalam, and the exclusive Dar Al Masyaf, 29 traditional

Dubai Souqs
Shopping in Dubai is a shopaholic‚Äôs dream ‚Äì 
there‚Äôs almost nothing you can‚Äôt buy here ‚Äì but 
away from the air-conditioned marble-floored 
shopping malls is another experience: the souqs. 
Many of these, such as the gold, textile and spice 
souqs clustered beside the Creek, date back to 
Dubai‚Äôs beginnings as a palm-fringed trading 
port. Exploring these through their warren-like 
alleyways is a delight and a visit to the UAE 
would be incomplete without spending time  
in at least some of these fascinating bazaars. 
Generally, each type of stall, be it spices, crafts, 
perfumes or clothing, are located close together, 
making it easy to spot a good deal. Bring cash 
and keep in mind that bargaining is expected.

operated by Kempinski hotels, Emirates Palace was built over three years by 
the architects responsible for Claridge‚Äôs in London. While the Burj Al Arab is 
touted as a ‚Äúseven-star‚Äù hotel, a rating that doesn‚Äôt exist, Emirates Palace

If offered a buggy 
ride while wandering 
the grounds, it would 
be advisable to take 
it, as Emirates Palace

Abu Dhabi Authority for  
Culture and Heritage
Emiratis proudly refer to Abu Dhabi as the New York of the 
UAE and Dubai as its LA. They see the city as an intellectual 
and cultural centre (whereas Dubai is all about the glitz 
and glam). No two buildings exemplify this more than the 
Authority for Culture and Heritage and Qasr Al Hosn. The 
Authority aims to make the UAE heritage and culture 
accessible to the city‚Äôs residents and visitors; the historic 
Qasr Al Hosn has been converted into a museum.

Desert Escapes
The Emirates‚Äô desert is sublime in parts and a trip here is 
incomplete without experiencing its myriad textures and 
colours. Not far out of the cities, camels graze on desert 
grass. If you don‚Äôt have a 4WD and off-road driving skills, 
the best way to experience the desert is at the magical 
desert resorts Al Maha or Bab Al Shams, or on a popular 
desert safari. While desert safaris are touristy, they‚Äôre lots 
of fun and allow you to tick off a range of experiences you 
otherwise wouldn‚Äôt get a chance to do. If you have time, 
stay overnight, sleep under the stars and enjoy the silence.

The UAE is all desert, 
apart from Al Ain‚Äôs lush 
date palm oases, the Hajar 
mountains and rocky east 
coast. There are stunning 
dunes 	CFMPX
dotted with 
camels on the roads to 
Hatta and Al Ain, but the 
most spectacular dunes 
are in the Liwa Oasis.  
@ Desert Safaris
Tour agencies like

organize exciting desert 
safaris. These may include 
an exhilarating desert drive 
in a 4WD 	BCPWF
, falconry 
displays, sandboarding, a 
sunset camel ride, Arabic 
buffet and belly dancing. 
¬£ Bedouin Tents
Traditional chocolate-
coloured goat- and camel-

The semi-nomadic lifestyle 
of the Bedu tribes ‚Äì most of 
whom spent the harsh summers 
inland at the cool date-palm 
oases and their winters Ô¨Åshing 
by the sea ‚Äì is a source of pride 
for Emiratis. d Visit the Heritage 
Villages in Dubai (see p67) and Abu  
Dhabi (see p89) for a glimpse into the  
Bedouin culture. 
@ 
The Camel
Mainstay of the Bedouin‚Äôs 
nomadic life, the camel enabled 
tribes to move their possessions 
from coastal villages to inland 
oases. Camel‚Äôs milk quenched 
their herders‚Äô thirst when water 
wasn‚Äôt found, while the fur was 
used to make tents, textiles, 
rugs, bags and cloaks. d Ride a

Dates were essential for 
desert survival. They were used 
to create tamr, a preserve, which 
helped sustain the Bedu over 
long journeys. There are over 50 
date varieties in the UAE.  
d Bateel (see p37) sells good dates.

Around Dubai ‚Äì Deira
T
HE TERM DEIRA IS USED TO DESCRIBE the bustling commercial area 
north of the Creek. Deira is the source of Dubai‚Äôs trading roots and it  
is around the Creek that you really get a sense of this. There is a telling 
contrast between the sight of the old wooden dhows moored at the 
wharfside reflected in the glass fa√ßades of the spectacularly sleek 
skyscrapers. Much of the dhow cargo is destined for the souqs and 
shopping districts of buzzy Deira. As a result, this area boasts some of  
Dubai‚Äôs most atmospheric souq-life, especially at the Gold Souq, Spice  
Souq and Deira Souq. A major preservation effort by Dubai Municipality 
means that this area offers some architectural 
gems like the Al-Ahmadiya School and the 
Heritage House. The narrow streets and the 
general traffic congestion in the area mean that 
to enjoy it all, it‚Äôs really best to explore on foot.

Al-Ahmadiya School
Dubai‚Äôs Ô¨Årst school, opened 
in 1912, was founded by a 
philanthropist pearl merchant. 
Maths, the Holy Koran and 
Arabic calligraphy were taught. 
The boys sat on palm mats. 
Many such schools were located 
in Emirati coastal cities with the 
support of leading merchants 
and Sheikhs, who subsidised the 
education. This school closed in 
1963. Now a museum and worth 
visiting for its sheer architectural 
grace, it offers an educational 
insight into the past. d Map K1

Tucked away in the busy

beautifully restored mud-brick 
watchtower that stands in its 
own gardens. This round tower is 
Burj Nahar. It dates back to 1870 
when it was one of three towers 
that served as part of Dubai‚Äôs 
network of defences. Guards 
would scale the tower and keep 
watch for invaders during tribal 
disputes. The short masonry

You are unlikely to have ever

in Dubai‚Äôs historic Gold Souq. 
The souq is still dominated by 
Indian and Iranian craftsmen

close on a century. It has been 
restored with a traditional

Spice Souq
Moody and atmospheric,  
the Spice Souq is a sensory trip 
into the past, where you can 
wander through a maze of narrow 
alleyways lined with shops piled 
high with aromatic spices. You‚Äôll 
Ô¨Ånd sacks of cinammon sticks, 
frankincense, cumin, coriander 
seed and oud. Some great 
souvenir buys include 
frankincense (sold with charcoal 
burner), henna kits (for hand and 
body decoration), saffron and 
fragrant rose water (see p20). 
^ 
Deira Souq
This is where you get a real 
taste of the melting pot of 
cultures that is Dubai. This souq 
is frequented by Emiratis and 
expats. The shops sell everything 
from bright Indian clothing to 
colourful kitchenware to electric 
household appliances to pirated 
CDs. It‚Äôs a fascinating area to 
wander in. If you do plan to 
shop, remember, nothing is sold 
without haggling (see p20).

Baniyas Square
This busy commercial square 
and trafÔ¨Åc junction is the heart of 
Deira‚Äôs business district and is 
home to airlines, hotels, 
restaurants, shwarma stands and 
businesses. By night, it glows 
with Tokyo-esque neon lights and 
signs. The Dubai Department of 
Tourism and Commerce 
Marketing has a useful Visitors 
Information Bureau here. The 
square is named after the 
inÔ¨Çuential Bani Yas tribe of Abu 
Dhabi, from which the ruling 
Maktoum family of Dubai is 
branched. d Map L2

Dhow Wharfs
A walk along the wharfside 
besides Baniyas Road allows you 
to get up close to the painted 
wooden dhows, the traditional 
Arabian sailing vessels, moored 
here. These ships still trade 
around the Gulf. Their cargo 
these days is tyres, refrigerators, 
air conditioners, electronics ‚Äì 
just about any modern item! 
Moored Ô¨Åve or six abreast, these 
dhows have sailed to trade with 
Dubai from places such as Iran, 
Pakistan and Sudan since the 
1830s. d Map K3 ‚Ä¢ Baniyas Rd

Deira History
Liberal trade policies are the roots 
of Deira which, by the early 20th 
century, had developed the 
largest souq on the Arabian coast. 
It became a natural haven for 
merchants who left Lingah, on 
the Persian coast, after the 
introduction of high customs 
there in 1902. They continued to 
trade with Lingah, as do many of 
the dhows in the Creek.

city‚Äôs Ô¨Årst iconic buildings. Built 
in the mid-1990s by Carlos Ott, 
architect of the Op√©ra de la 
Bastille in Paris, it is inspired 
by the dhow. Its curved curtain 
glass wall symbolizes the 
billowing sail. The base of the

 A Souk Stroll
Aim to start this walk 
around 4:30pm, when the 
souq shops re-open after 
prayers and temperatures 
are cooler. Start with an 
BCSB crossing from the Bur 
Dubai Abra Station. You 
can disembark at Deira 
Old Souq Abra Station 
(see pp10‚Äì11). Take the 
underpass beneath 
Baniyas Road to emerge 
at the spice souq 
entrance. Enjoy a browse 
among the fragrant 
alleyways here. Leave the 
spice souq at Al-Abra St, 
turn right along Al-Ras St 
which leads into Sikkat 
Al-Khail St. Ahead you 
will see the latticed 
entrance to the Gold 
Souq with its colonnaded 
interior (see p59). There 
are more than 300 
jewellery shops to explore 
(most take credit cards). 
Wander into the alleyways 
off the main thoroughfare 
and enjoy a cup of tea at 
one of the small caf√©s. 
Exit at the gold souq and 
continue along Sikkat Al-
Khail St to the tiny Per-
fume Souq. The shop 
windows here are a 
treasure trove of bottles 
Ô¨Ålled with heady Arabian 
scents, incense and oud. 
Enjoy an evening snack by 
continuing along Sikkat Al-
Khail St to Ashwaq 
Cafeteria (see p64), a 
down-to-earth caf√© with 
outdoor tables, serving 
shwarmas. Next, return to 
the Creek to admire the 
Dhow Wharfage (see 
p84). For a relaxed end-of-
day, drop in at Radisson 
Blu Hotel‚Äôs Up on the 
Tenth (see p65) and chill 
with a cocktail and sensa-
tional sunset Creek views.

HIS BUSTLING PART OF THE CITY IS now packed with hotels, office block 
and residential developments, yet over a century ago it was an area of 
sand and barasti (palm frond houses) and windtower houses around the 
Creek. The best spot to get a real sense of old Bur Dubai is the historic 
Bastakiya quarter where the charming courtyard houses have been restored 
beside the Creek. This lovely atmospheric district is a quiet oasis amidst the 
city‚Äôs hustle and bustle. Here too is the imposing Al Fahidi Fort, now Dubai 
Museum, the original defence outpost for Dubai. The Shindagha heritage 
area, right at the Creek mouth, is the spot where 
Dubai‚Äôs role as an enterprising and cosmopolitan 
trading city really began. Bur Dubai‚Äôs souqs, 
beginning with the textile- and curio-filled old Bur 
Dubai creekside souq are evidence of this. If you 
explore the streets further back, into the heart of 
the dizzyingly-colourful Textile Souq, you‚Äôll find a 
real community feel.

Dubai Museum 
& Al Fahidi Fort
Once Dubai‚Äôs main defence 
outpost, the imposing sand-
coloured Al Fahidi Fort was built 
in 1788 and has also served as a 
gaol and the ruler‚Äôs residence. 
Renovated in 1970, it is now the 
city museum and worth a visit 
for an informative overview of 
the emirate‚Äôs history. It makes  
an entertaining visit for all ages: 
you can walk through a souq 
from the 1950s, visit an oasis 
with a falaj (irrigation channel), 
learn about the desert at night 
and visit a traditional barasti 
(palm frond) house (see pp8‚Äì9). 
@ 
Bastakiya
This is one of the oldest  
and most atmospheric heritage 
areas in Dubai. Here you can 
wander the alleyways between 
original, restored courtyard 
houses, many crowned by 
barjeel (windtowers) which were 
the earliest forms of air 
conditioning. Late afternoon is 
the best time to spend a couple 
of hours here, when the light 
throws the architecture into 
golden relief. The area has 
become a cultural hub for the 
city with many buildings 
converted to art galleries and 
courtyard caf√©s (see pp12‚Äì13).

Heritage Village

A microcosm of Dubai‚Äôs cultural 
and historic past, located near

area, this traditional complex is a 
living museum staffed by potters 
and weavers practising crafts  
as they have for centuries. 
There‚Äôs a tented Bedouin village, 
armoury displays, handicraft 
shops, camel rides and an 
exhibition of Emirati cooking 
techniques. The Diving Village 
focuses on Dubai‚Äôs sea-faring 
and pearl diving history, with 
displays of traditional dhows and 
black and white photographs.

Sheikh Saeed 
Al-Maktoum House
Built in 1896 from coral stone

this was the home of Dubai‚Äôs 
former ruler until his death in 
1958. The house was opened as 
a museum in 1986 and contains 
collections of photographs, 
coins, stamps and documents. 
It‚Äôs worth visiting for the building 
itself, with its four windtowers 
and verandahs. Photographs 
from the 1950s‚Äì80s show 
seaplanes landing in the Creek 
and reveal the extraordinary pace 
of development. Copies of early

This early ofÔ¨Åce building, the Ô¨Årst 
building in Dubai built speciÔ¨Åcally

had to contend with. To the rear

The Maktoum family‚Äôs reign as 
rulers of Dubai began in 1833, 
when Sheikh Maktoum bin Buti 
and around 800 tribesmen broke 
away from the Bani Yas tribe of 
Abu Dhabi. They settled in 
Shindagha, an ideal location for 
trade and for the development of 
Dubai‚Äôs pearling and  
Ô¨Åshing industries.

HE KEY ARTERY OF DUBAI, SHEIKH ZAYED RD is the outset of the highway 
direct to Abu Dhabi. It‚Äôs becoming known as ‚ÄúThe Strip‚Äù because, just as 
in Las Vegas, this symbol of Dubai‚Äôs meteoric development is flanked with the 
most innovative and contemporary of global architecture. Gleaming skyscrapers 
tower above the lines of traffic beneath. Symbolically too, the road is the path 
to the city‚Äôs future visionary expansion programme. Coming up at Interchange 
One are the Burj Khalifa, the world‚Äôs tallest 
building and The Dubai Mall, Dubai‚Äôs greatest 
tribute to consumerism. Further out, industrial Al

the tallest building in the city,

Sheikh Rashid and Queen 
Elizabeth II of England. It has 
played an important role in the 
city‚Äôs development, a fact 
reÔ¨Çected by the continued 
use of its image on the

also comprises eight 
huge exhibition halls.

The Burj Dubai, as it was

was renamed the Burj Khalifa 
in 2010 in honour of the 
President of the UAE. At 
818 m (2,700 ft) tall, the 
tower became the tallest 
structure in the world 
long before building work 
Ô¨Ånished. On the 124th 
Ô¨Çoor is an impressive 
observation deck from 
where visitors can see 
just about everything  
for several miles around. 
In front of the Burj sits

Arabian-styled One&Only Royal Mirage and the vast Madinat Jumeirah, plus 
a string of others stretching out along this all-important coastal strip of the 
Arabian Gulf. Out at sea is the famous Palm Jumeirah Island, whose villa-

Beach is the 9-km (6 miles) 
stretch of golden coastline 
running parallel to the Jumeirah 
Beach Rd, lined by some of the 
city‚Äôs most desirable villa accom-
modation and hotels. There‚Äôs a 
good choice of public beaches at 
Umm Suqueim, Kite Beach and 
Russian Beach, while the plea-
sant Jumeirah Beach Park is a 
delightful spot to while away a 
day in the sun. d .BQ"t+VNFJSBI

needed to visit the interior of 
this opulent hotel. For a great

Atlantis, The Palm
Opened in 2008 and sitting 
at the top end of the Palm 
Jumeirah is the unmistakable 
Atlantis hotel. This sprawling, 
aquatic-themed resort boasts a 
vast beach, an enormous marine 
park where visitors can swim 
with dolphins and an impressive 
adventure waterpark. An 
extensive range of restaurants 
and other facilities are also on 
site to keep the entire family 
entertained (see p44).

Safa Park
You can‚Äôt miss the giant 
Ferris wheel here, offering the 
best views of this huge land-
scaped green park stretching 
from Al Wasl Rd to Sheikh Zayed 
Rd. It is hugely popular with local 
residents, many of whom make 
the most of its specially-sprung 
perimeter jogging track. It‚Äôs great 
for kids to run free and there‚Äôs 
lots of entertainment too with 
tennis courts, trampolining, mini 
train, a merry-go-round, obstacle 
course and lake where rowing 
boats can be hired. d Map A5
& 
Jumeirah Beach Park
This lovely green park, full of 
mature trees, backs onto a 
beautiful stretch of white sand 
beach. It is a real gem and an 
ideal place to spend a day in the 
sun, although weekends are best 
avoided when it gets crowded. 
You can access the beach from 
the park along wooden walkways 
and there is plenty of shade on 
the sand under the many palm 
trees. It‚Äôs great for children and 
is equipped with lifeguards, a 
shallow beach, showers, toilets, 
barbecues, picnic tables and 
small caf√©s. d Map A4

All of the hotels in Jumeirah are 
fronted by their own private 
stretches of golden beach onto 
the Arabian Gulf, but there are 
plenty of public beaches too, 
which Ô¨Åll up at weekends. There 
are also family-friendly beach

Dubai Marina is a stunning

luxury apartment towers and 
ofÔ¨Åces. Unsurprisingly, alfresco 
waterside life has really taken off 
alongside the main pedestrian 
area, Marina Walk, where there 
are dozens of outdoor caf√©s. 
Friday sees the setting up of 
Marina Markets around the 
stunning central fountain and 
dancing water features and the 
arrival of dozens of colourful 
stalls selling art and handicrafts. 
It‚Äôs a great chance to combine 
shopping with some sunshine.  
d Map B2 
Start your day with 
breakfast on the outdoor 
terrace of Lime Tree Caf√© 
(see p84). Enjoy the gentle 
morning sun as you sip on 
some coffee or a juice.
Drive or hire a taxi to 
Jumeirah Beach Park 
where you can take a safe 
swim. Follow it up with a 
picnic snack on the 
manicured lawns. If you 
want to simply laze about, 
you can hire a sunbed 
under the palmtrees and 
spend the morning 
relaxing in the sunshine. 
Leave at lunchtime and 
head to Madinat 
Jumeirah (see pp18‚Äì19) 
where you have a huge 
choice of restaurants at 
which to enjoy a leisurely 
late lunch, many 
overlooking the 
waterways. Afterwards 
spend an hour or two 
shopping for souvenirs or 
browsing the lovely 
Arabian-style Madinat 
Jumeirah Souq here. 
Now head to one of 
Dubai‚Äôs most atmospheric 
resort venues, the 
One&Only Royal Mirage‚Äôs 
Arabian Court, to the 
Rooftop Bar (see p85). 
From this alfresco spot, 
you can sip a cocktail over 
superb views of Palm 
Jumeirah Island (see p32) 
and watch the sun set 
over the Gulf. For dinner 
head to the hotel‚Äôs Beach 
Bar & Grill, a delightful 
Arabian-themed seafood 
restaurant located on 
decking right on the beach 
where you can enjoy the 
sound of the waves. It‚Äôs 
worth booking a table here

STUNNING CITY OF SHINY SKYSCRAPERS LINING a splendid Corniche, 
 oil-rich Abu Dhabi is the capital of Abu Dhabi emirate as well as of the 
UAE. Home to the excellent arts centre, the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and 
Heritage, it is also the country‚Äôs cultural and intellectual capital. It is often 
compared to New York, with its more glamorous sister Dubai likened to LA. An 
island-city with plenty of narrow white sand beaches and crystal clear turquoise 
waters lapping at its shores, Abu Dhabi is popular with beachcombers and 
lovers of the outdoors. Local residents ritually power-walk along the city‚Äôs 
waterfront. The median strips of its wide streets are planted with towering date 
palms, while its green parks are packed with playground equipment for kids.

Heritage Village
The delightful Heritage Village 
provides a fascinating insight into 
what everyday life was like in 
Abu Dhabi before oil was 
discovered. A recreation of a 
traditional mosque, barasti 
house, Bedouin camp and souq 
are all worth a look, but the star 
sight is an intriguing museum 
set in a fort with fabulous 
exhibits featuring costumes, 
jewellery, everyday utensils, 
pearling tools and weapons. 
There‚Äôs an arcade of artisan‚Äôs 
workshops where you can watch 
basket weaving, glass blowing, 
weaving and brass-beating.

Completed in 2007, the building 
can accommodate 40,000

available to non-Muslims. Visitors 
should dress conservatively, 
wearing loose-Ô¨Åtting clothing that 
covers the arms and legs. This

The Discovery of Oil
The Japanese invention of the 
cultured pearl and the subsequent 
collapse of the Gulf‚Äôs pearl 
industry led to the granting of 
petroleum concessions by Sheikh 
Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahayan in 
1939. It turned out to be a very 
wise move. The discovery of oil in 
1958 and its export from 1962 
made Abu Dhabi a very rich city.

Planning Your Trip
! Passports & Visa
Complimentary 60-
day visit visas are 
available on arrival at 
UAE airport immigration 
desks. Passports must 
be valid for 6 months 
from the date of entry to 
the UAE. Visas can be 
extended at the Depart-
ment of Naturalisation 
and Residency (Tel: 02 
398 1010). d Visa free; 
visa extension Dh500 for 30 
days ‚Ä¢ dxbimmig@emirates.
net.ae ‚Ä¢ www.dnrd.gov.ae 
@ Insurance
While petty crime is 
extremely rare in the 
UAE, insurance covering 
loss of luggage and theft 
is always good to have, 
along with comprehen-
sive health and dental 
insurance. Hospitals are 
very efÔ¨Åcient, but the 
services are expensive. 
¬£ When to Go
Winter is usually 
when Dubai is at its best. 
This is when the Dubai 
Shopping Festival, Global 
Village and most major 
international sporting 
events take place. In 
recent years though, the 
UAE has had cool, grey, 
wet winters. So those 
wanting guaranteed 
sunshine should visit 
during Oct‚ÄìNov or Mar‚Äì
Apr instead. Summer is 
best avoided. 
$ What to Take
Bring swimwear, a 
hat and sun block 
(expensive in the UAE) 
for the beach. Loose 
linen and cotton clothes 
are best for sightseeing. 
Make sure they‚Äôre not 
transparent ‚Äì remember, 
it‚Äôs a conservative 
country, so you need to 
dress modestly. Pack a 
cardigan or sweater as 
most indoor places are 
air-conditioned. 
% How Long to Stay
While Dubai makes a 
great 2‚Äì3 day stopover 
on your way somewhere, 
5 days to a week is 
wonderful if you want to 
relax at a beach resort, 
do some serious 
shopping in the souqs 
and malls, as well as take 
in the sights of Dubai 
Creek, Bastakiya and 
Shindagha. Add 1‚Äì2 days 
to visit Abu Dhabi. 
^ Electricity
UAE power sockets 
generally accept the UK 
three prong plug 
operating on 220/240 
volts, although you may 
also see the European 
two round prong plug. 
It‚Äôs not a bad idea to 
bring an adaptor that 
works for both. Most 
good hotels will have 
adaptors you can borrow, 
or you can buy them in 
local supermarkets. 
& Customs & Duty 
Free
The duty free allowance 
is 400 cigarettes or 2 kg 
of tobacco, cigars to the 
value of AED 3000 and 5 
litres of wine or spirits. 
It‚Äôs illegal to purchase 
alcohol in the UAE 
without a liquor license 
(only available to UAE 
Residents), so buy duty 
free at the airport if you 
want to have sunset 
drinks on the balcony but 
want to avoid expensive 
mini-bar costs. 
* Prohibited Items
In addition to the 
items on most countries‚Äô 
blacklists, such as 
Ô¨Årearms, illegal drugs and 
pornography, it is for-
bidden to bring in any 
banned movies, tv 
programs and offensive 
publications, especially 
Ô¨Ålms and programs that 
may include scenes with 
passionate kissing, sex, 
nudity or semi-nudity, 
drug-use or any content 
relating to Israel.
( Time Zone
The UAE time zone is 
GMT+4. It is 6 hours 
behind Australian Eastern 
Standard Time. There is 
no daylight saving. 
) Opening Hours  
& Weekends
The UAE weekend is 
Friday and Saturday. 
Business hours aren‚Äôt 
Ô¨Åxed, but generally, 
shopping malls open 
10am‚Äì10pm Sat‚ÄìThu, 
opening in the late 
afternoon and evening on 
Fridays. Shops in the 
streets open approxi-
mately the same times 
but close for lunch from 
1pm‚Äì4/5pm. Government 
departments open 
around 7am and close to 
the public around 3pm. 
Dubai has several good local English-language TV stations. Most 
hotel rooms feature global satellite channels like CNN and BBC.

Walking is better in the 
cooler winter months. 
However, in the scor-
ching heat of summer, 
it‚Äôs not advisable as there 
is little shelter.

Things to be Aware of
! Languages
Arabic is the ofÔ¨Åcial 
language, although 
English is widely spoken. 
As 80% of the population 
are foreign, you‚Äôll hear 
scores of languages on 
the street. Signage is 
generally in both Arabic 
and English. 
@ Islam
The UAE is an Islamic 
state following a tolerant 
version of Sharia Law, 
with both Sharia and civil 
law courts. UAE Muslims 
adhere to the conduct of 
Islam, praying Ô¨Åve times 
a day, donating to 
charity, fasting and doing 
the pilgrimage to Mecca. 
¬£ Call-to-prayer
If you stay in Deira, 
Bur Dubai or the 
Bastakiya area in 
particular, you‚Äôll hear the 
beautiful sound of the 
call-to-prayer echoing 
through the streets Ô¨Åve 
times a day. Broadcast 
from the minarets of 
mosques, the call-to-
prayer beckons Muslims 
to come and worship. 
$ Respectful 
Conduct
Never shake hands with 
an Emirati woman unless 
offered her hand Ô¨Årst. If 
visiting someone‚Äôs home, 
remove your shoes, don‚Äôt 
show the soles of your 
feet and don‚Äôt eat with 
your left hand. Displays 
of affection among 
couples in public are 
frowned upon. While 
holding hands is 
acceptable, passionate 
kissing and embracing is 
not. Rude gestures and 
swearing are offensive. 
% Photographing 
Women
Photographing Emirati 
and other Muslim 
women is not acceptable 
without asking their 
permission Ô¨Årst. Even at 
places where covered 
ladies prepare local food 
for sale as part of the 
displays, ask Ô¨Årst before 
taking their photo. 
Photography of Sheikhs‚Äô 
palaces, police and 
military buildings, ports 
and airports is forbidden. 
^ Dress Code
Visitors should dress 
modestly. Loose long 
linen or cotton clothing is 
respectful and is also 
suited to the scorching 
heat. Women should not 
wear tight or transparent 
clothing, skirts above the 
knee, sleeveless tops, 
halter-necks or shoestring 
straps in public, while 
men should refrain from 
wearing shorts and 
sleeveless tops. In 
Sharjah, wearing these 
clothes in public can 
incur a severe penalty. 
& Pork
Muslims do not eat 
pork, however, pork 
products are for sale to 
non-Muslims in ‚ÄúPork 
Rooms‚Äù in supermarkets 
such as Spinneys. Most 
restaurants at Ô¨Åve star 
hotels include pork on 
their menus. 
* Alcohol
It‚Äôs illegal to purchase 
alcohol without a liquor 
license (only available to 
UAE Residents) so buy 
alcohol at the airport duty 
free shop. You can drink 
alcohol in hotels and 
licensed venues. 
Penalties for drunken 
behaviour in public are 
heavy. Sharjah is a dry 
emirate ‚Äì alcohol is not 
sold or allowed there. 
( Sheikh 
Mohammed 
Centre for Cultural 
Understanding
This organization runs a 
number of activities 
under the ‚ÄúOpen Doors, 
Open Minds‚Äù program, 
which is aimed at 
promoting tolerance of 
culture and religion. Stop 
at the Bastakiya court-
yard house to book a tour 
(see pp12‚Äì13). 
) Ramadan & 
Islamic holidays
Religious festivals rely on 
the sighting of the moon. 
Alcohol is not served the 
night before a religious 
holiday. During the holy 
month of Ramadan, 
government ofÔ¨Åces 
operate on shorter hours, 
most shops close during 
the day, and eating, 
drinking and smoking in 
public is forbidden. There 
is no music or dancing 
either. After Iftar 
(breaking of the fast), the 
mood is festive ‚Äì malls 
stay open until midnight 
and the celebratory spirit 
is infectious.

Things to Avoid
! Dehydration
Whether lying by the 
pool or walking around 
town, you‚Äôre equally at 
risk of dehydrating in the 
UAE‚Äôs ferocious heat. To 
avoid dehydration, wear 
light clothes, avoid the 
sun in the hottest part of 
the day and drink much 
more water than you 
normally would at home. 
@ Traffic Accidents
Dubai‚Äôs trafÔ¨Åc is 
horriÔ¨Åc. Be vigilant as a 
pedestrian and as a 
passenger don‚Äôt be 
embarrassed to ask your 
driver to ‚Äúshway shway!‚Äù 
(slow down!). 
¬£ Rush Hour
Don‚Äôt think about 
going anywhere in Dubai 
from 8am‚Äì10am (when 
commuters head to 
work), noon‚Äì2pm (when 
they go home or out for 
lunch) and from 4pm‚Äì
6:30pm. Also avoid the 
roads around 8pm‚Äì9pm 
on Thursday and Friday 
nights, when everyone 
seems to be going out. 
$ Parking & 
Speeding Tickets
UAE parking and trafÔ¨Åc 
cops take their jobs very 
seriously. Look out for 
speed signs, particularly 
in areas where there are 
road works. Always look 
for parking signs and 
orange parking metres 
wherever you park, 
especially at night. 
Otherwise, expect to 
return to a parking ticket 
on your windscreen. 
% Road Surprises!
While you might Ô¨Ånd 
those ‚ÄúRoad Surprises!‚Äù 
signs amusing the Ô¨Årst 
time you see them (and 
everyone loves to stop to 
take a photo of the camel 
sign), they‚Äôre there for a 
reason. Slow down and 
look out for dips, speed 
bumps and sand on the 
road. And while they‚Äôre 
very cute, camels can be 
troublesome ‚Äì they just 
love to take a stroll on 
the freeway. 
^ Driving in Rain 
& Sand Storms
Rainy weather makes 
driving hazardous simply 
because UAE residents 
aren‚Äôt used to driving in 
the rain, so they won‚Äôt 
necessarily slow down. 
The rate of accidents is 
considerably higher in 
wet weather. Decelerate 
or pull over in sand 
storms when visibility is 
poor. When you see 
oncoming drivers with 
their hazard lights on, it 
means conditions are 
even worse up ahead. 
& Swimming 
Dangers
When you see signs 
warning bathers about 
dangerous rips and 
strong undertows,  
these should be taken 
seriously. Avoid 
swimming if you‚Äôre not a 
strong swimmer, or take 
extra care. Despite the 
calm appearance of the 
water, Dubai‚Äôs beaches 
have very powerful 
undercurrents. 
* Souq Spruikers
The most annoying 
thing about shopping in 
the souqs is the 
spruiking. Touts aggres-
sively attempt to lure 
customers into shops to 
buy ‚Äúcopy watches, copy 
bags, Madam!‚Äù Unless 
you want to buy these 
counterfeit goods (great 
value but illegal), the 
best strategy is to ignore 
them completely. Show 
even the slightest bit of 
interest or politeness, 
and they‚Äôll never leave 
you alone. 
( Drugs
Do not attempt to 
bring drugs into the 
country. Keep in mind that 
even some prescription 
drugs, such as codeine, 
and anti-depressant and 
HRT medications are 
banned (see p102). The 
UAE has a zero tolerance 
policy on drugs. Penalties 
and sentences are harsh. 
While the death penalty 
is an option, it‚Äôs rarely 
applied. However, you‚Äôre 
more likely to serve a 
long sentence and get 
deported. 
) Prostitutes
If you stay in Bur 
Dubai neighbourhoods 
such as Mankhool, you‚Äôll 
see prostitutes on the 
streets at night, often 
from China and former 
Soviet countries. They 
also frequent many bars 
and nightclubs in Deira 
and Bur Dubai. Prostitution 
is illegal and prostitutes 
are best avoided.

Useful Information
! Business & 
Shopping Hours
The ofÔ¨Åcial weekend is 
Friday and Saturday. 
Everyone has a day off 
on the main Friday prayer 
day, while some work 
half or full days on 
Saturday. Government 
departments open 
7:30am‚Äì3pm while 
private companies work 
9am‚Äì5pm. Supermarkets 
open 8am‚Äì10pm while 
major malls open 10am‚Äì
10pm. Smaller malls and 
independent shops do 
not open until the 
afternoon on Fridays. 
@ Climate
The UAE has an arid 
sub-tropical climate with 
infrequent rainfall. The 
country was synonymous 
with year-round sunshine 
until the 2006 winter, 
one of the wettest on 
record. Temperatures 
average 20 degrees 
Celsius in winter to 45 
degrees Celsius in 
summer. 
¬£ Weights & 
Measures
The UAE uses the metric 
system, except for petrol, 
when it uses gallons. A 
wide range of measure-
ment systems are used 
for clothes and shoes 
which are manufactured 
in Europe, Asia, the 
Middle East and North 
America. 
$ Taxes
Residents of the UAE 
don‚Äôt pay income tax. 
This is a big incentive for 
expats to build a life 
here. The only taxes here 
are on alcohol and the 
municipality and service 
taxes on hotel rooms. 
% Photography  
& Video
Emiratis are obsessed 
with technology so if 
you‚Äôre after something 
new you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd a wide 
range of well-priced 
digital cameras. If you 
need additional memory 
cards, tapes or batteries 
try the myriad electronics 
stores in City Centre and 
Baniyas Square, Deira. 
^ Smoking
UAE legislation 
introduced in 2004 
provided for a ban on 
smoking in public places, 
including shopping malls, 
restaurants and 
entertainment venues. 
Unfortunately this has 
not been enforced. By 
law, restaurants are 
required to have non-
smoking sections but 
most don‚Äôt. At the time 
of research the UAE was 
set to enforce laws and 
give ofÔ¨Åcials power to 
issue on-the-spot Ô¨Ånes to 
lawbreakers. 
& Homosexuality
Homosexuality is 
illegal and homosexual 
practices are punishable 
with harsh penalties. 
You‚Äôll see men from 
Central Asia and the 
Indian Subcontinent 
holding hands ‚Äì this does 
not mean they are gay; 
they are just good 
friends. Likewise, you‚Äôll 
see Emirati men rub 
noses when they meet, 
in the same way that 
close male friends kiss 
cheeks in Europe‚Äôs 
Mediterranean countries. 
* Women Travellers
Women travelling 
solo in the UAE shouldn‚Äôt 
experience any harass-
ment if they follow local 
norms. They should sit in 
the back seat of taxis, in 
the ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs section‚Äù of 
buses and eat in ‚Äúfamily 
rooms‚Äù in cheap hotels. 
Dedicated women‚Äôs 
queues at banks and 
government departments 
mean women get 
preferential service. 
( Contraceptives
Contraceptives can 
be purchased in 
pharmacies in the UAE 
without a prescription. 
They‚Äôll generally be kept 
on the shelves alongside 
women‚Äôs hygiene 
products. The price is 
comparable to Europe 
and Australasia. 
) Toilets
All shopping centres, 
Ô¨Åve star hotels and good 
restaurants and bars 
have clean toilets ‚Äì it‚Äôs 
okay to walk off the 
street to use these. In 
shopping centres and 
cheaper street eateries 
you may come across 
‚Äúhole in the ground‚Äù 
Oriental toilets alongside 
Western toilets. You will 
also Ô¨Ånd bidets or a hose 
for ablutions. 
All restaurants charge municipality tax and service tax, which  
totals to 17.5 per cent.

Security & Health
! Precautions
The biggest danger to 
your health and wellbeing 
in the UAE is the heat. 
Take precautions to avoid 
dehydration, sunburn and 
sunstroke. From June to 
August in particular, avoid 
walking as much as 
possible and take 
advantage of the cheap 
air-conditioned taxis. 
@ Personal Safety
While petty crime is 
unheard of, be sensible ‚Äì 
don‚Äôt dress like a tourist 
and don‚Äôt Ô¨Çash cash 
around. The most 
dangerous place is on 
the road. The UAE has 
one of the highest rates 
of road deaths on the 
planet. As a pedestrian 
be vigilant; drivers will 
not stop for you on a 
crossing, so cross only at 
lights where possible. If 
your taxi driver is driving 
too fast or recklessly, tell 
him to slow down. 
¬£ Drinking Water  
& Food Safety
The tap water is safe to 
drink. At most, you may 
experience an upset 
tummy for a couple of 
days as your body 
adjusts to new bacteria. 
When eating street food, 
only try eateries popular 
with locals. 
$ Consulates
Generally, embassies 
are in Abu Dhabi and 
consulates in Dubai, 
although there are a few 
exceptions. Check your 
consulate‚Äôs UAE website 
for travel warnings and 
security information. 
Consulate phone 
numbers are listed in the 
Etisalat phone directory 
that is available in most 
hotel rooms. 
% Emergency Info
In case of 
emergency, phone the 
following numbers: Police 
999; Ambulance 998/999; 
Fire Department 997; 
Operator 181. 
^ If You Get Arrested
The UAE is an Islamic 
state and you can land in 
trouble for not res-
pecting religious customs 
and decency laws. Under 
absolutely no condition 
drink alcohol and drive. In 
Sharjah, it‚Äôs illegal for 
women to travel in a 
vehicle with men other 
than their husband. 
Women must dress 
modestly and not show 
their d√©colletage, upper 
arms or back. In Dubai 
and Abu Dhabi, arrests 
have resulted from 
foreigners being too 
affectionate in public, 
particularly during 
Ramadan. If you get 
arrested, do not sign 
anything in Arabic 
immediately. Your 
consulate should be your 
Ô¨Årst call ‚Äì they can help 
facilitate contact with a 
local bilingual lawyer. 
& Road Traffic 
Accidents
If you‚Äôre in an accident, 
Ô¨Årst get out of harm‚Äôs 
way, then call the police 
(999) for instructions. Do 
not move the car unless 
instructed to do so by 
the police. If another 
party is involved and you 
have your camera handy, 
take photos for insurance 
purposes. 
* Hospitals
Hospital standards 
are outstanding in the 
UAE at both private and 
public hospitals. You will 
Ô¨Ånd that the service is 
faster at emergency 
departments at private 
hospitals. d Dubai:

24 hours. The daily 
newspapers list them. 
However, in Dubai, you 
can phone 04 223 2323

Budget Tips
! When Not to Go
Avoid Dubai and Abu 
Dhabi during major 
events and conferences 
(unless it‚Äôs something 
you actually want to go 
to!) when hotel room 
prices go through the 
roof. While December 
and January are the 
coolest months, winter is 
the peak season and 
hotels charge rack rates. 
Ramadan is another 
period to avoid. 
@ Summer Savings
While summer is 
best avoided due to the 
ferocious heat, this is the 
ideal time for budget 
travellers. Most hotels 
drop their rates by 50% 
and offer excellent 
holiday packages. The 
Summer Surprises 
shopping festival means 
there are great bargains 
to be found.
 
¬£ Internet Deals
Travellers averse to 
package deals can Ô¨Ånd 
great deals on the 
Internet if they can be 
Ô¨Çexible. Accommodation 
websites such as 
Expedia offer great hotels 
at bargain prices, 
particularly in the quiet 
periods between big 
events and conferences. 
Hotel websites, such as 
the Accor site, are also  
a great source for 
discounted rooms.  
$ Transport
Budget travellers can 
save money by catching 
the abra across Dubai 
Creek. These open-sided 
wooden boats cost just 
AED 1 per trip and 
connect Dubai‚Äôs main 
sights in Deira and Bur 
Dubai. The buses are a 
cheap alternative to taxis 
(see p103). 
% Supermarkets
The supermarkets are 
excellent in the UAE. It‚Äôs 
possible to Ô¨Ånd products 
from all over the world. 
Carrefour has a 
reputation for having the 
lowest prices. It also has 
the best bakery with 
delicious Middle Eastern 
pastries and an excellent 
deli counter where you 
buy olives, cheeses and 
cold meats for picnics 
and balcony snacks while 
you enjoy the sunset.  
^ Brunches  
& Buffets
The Friday Brunch is a 
ritual for many expats. 
Five star hotels offer 
great value all-you-can-
eat-and-drink brunches, 
including alcohol, from 
AED 70‚Äì200 per person. 
Similar mid-week buffet 
lunches and dinners are 
also great value, starting 
from as low as AED 47.  
Check local magazines 
for the latest offers. 
& Cheap Eats
A couple of 
shwarmas and a fresh 
mango juice make a 
great cheap eat. 
Shwarmas cost around 
AED 3 and juices from 
AED 6. If you‚Äôre after 
something more Ô¨Ålling, 
head to one of Dubai and 
Abu Dhabi‚Äôs many cheap 
ethnic eateries (see p64) 
where you can spend as 
little as AED 30 per 
person for a curry or 
biryani or a few mezze 
dishes and a mixed 
Arabic grill. 
* Happy Hours
While alcohol is 
expensive in the UAE  
(it‚Äôs the only thing that  
is taxed), you can drink 
cheaply if you take 
advantage of happy 
hours (generally from 
6pm‚Äì8pm) and drink 
promotions. Many bars 
and clubs offer half-price 
drinks, two-for-one deals, 
two free drinks or ‚Äúfree 
bubbly for the ladies‚Äù, on 
particular nights.  
( Free Stuff to Do
In Dubai, a walk 
through the Bastakiya or 
on Shindagha waterfront 
is free, while it costs 
nothing to stroll along 
Abu Dhabi‚Äôs beautiful 
Corniche.  
) Discounts & 
Bargaining
Bargaining is expected in 
the souqs and carpet 
shops. Make an offer at 
half the price and work 
up from there. In 
electronics and jewellery 
stores, it‚Äôs acceptable to 
ask if that‚Äôs the best 
price or for a discount if 
you pay cash or buy two. 
Let them know if you 
found something cheaper 
elsewhere and they‚Äôll 
probably drop their price. 
Always keep small notes in your wallet when shopping.

Accommodation & Dining Tips
! Hotel Taxes
The UAE is a tax-free 
country. However, 
visitors to the UAE can 
expect to pay a 10 per 
cent government tax and 
a 10 per cent service 
charge on hotel rooms. 
@ Rooms
Hotel rooms in the 
UAE are spacious and 
also extremely secure. 
Most rooms are air-
conditioned and come 
well equipped with 
television, telephones, 
minibar, tea and coffee 
facilities, toiletries and  
in-room safe. The best 
hotels also provide 
complimentary news-
papers and bottled water. 
¬£ Rack Rates  
& Discounts
While rack rates are 
quoted throughout this 
guide, they are rarely 
paid in the UAE. 
Travellers can book online 
through accommodation 
booking sites with 
considerably reduced 
discounts or book hotels 
as part of a package deal, 
while UAE residents can 
call hotels and request  
a residents discount. 
$ Concierges
UAE concierges are 
generally excellent. They 
are a good source of 
local information and can 
recommend and book 
restaurants and organize 
transport and tours. They 
can also arrange to store 
your luggage if you have 
a late Ô¨Çight. 
% Extra costs
Extras that can add 
signiÔ¨Åcantly to hotel 
room bills include phone 
calls and minibar costs.  
If you need to make lots 
of local phone calls, buy 
a local SIM card and 
phone card. While 
minibar prices are 
comparable to bar prices, 
you‚Äôre better off buying 
duty free liquor. 
^ Valet Parking
Almost all UAE hotels 
provide valet parking 
free-of-charge. Rarely will 
guests pay for valet 
parking if they‚Äôre staying 
at a hotel, although there 
are exceptions. If you‚Äôre 
staying in a mid-range or 
budget Deira hotel, you 
may have to park your 
car at a nearby parking 
station. The average cost 
is AED 20 per night. If 
you‚Äôre hiring a car, 
contact your hotel ahead 
of time to enquire about 
parking facilities. 
& Tipping
In the UAE, it‚Äôs 
customary to tip, 
although not obligatory. 
While most restaurants 
include a service charge, 
this doesn‚Äôt always go to 
waiting staff. If the 
service was good, leave 
a tip, anything from 5‚Äì10 
per cent. If it didn‚Äôt meet 
your expectations, don‚Äôt 
tip. Give porters a couple 
of dirhams per piece of 
luggage and if the taxi 
driver was friendly and 
helped with luggage, 
leave him a few coins. 
* Restaurant 
Reservations
Most hotels have 
‚ÄúRestaurant 
Reservations‚Äù services. 
Take advantage of these 
to make your bookings, 
as there‚Äôs nothing as 
tedious as having to visit 
half a dozen eateries 
before you Ô¨Ånd a table. 
Restaurants Ô¨Åll quickly in 
Dubai and Abu Dhabi  
and it can be hard to get 
a table on weekends. 
Make bookings as far in 
advance as possible.
( Meal Times
UAE residents and 
locals eat late compared 
to North American, 
British and Australasian 
diners. Arab expats and 
Emiratis tend to book 
restaurant tables from 
10pm onwards, while 
European expats eat 
around 8:30pm‚Äì9pm. Eat 
any earlier and you‚Äôll 
miss out on the fun ‚Äì 
you‚Äôll only be dining with 
other tourists. 
) Dress Codes
Good restaurants 
require smart-casual to 
formal dress in the UAE. 
Emiratis wear their best 
dishdashas and abayas, 
while expats dress up 
too ‚Äì even in casual 
restaurants, women will 
look glam while men will 
wear trousers (never 
jeans) and a long sleeved 
shirt. In Ô¨Åne dining 
restaurants, a smart suit 
jacket is expected 
(although a tie is 
sometimes optional).
