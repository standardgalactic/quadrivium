About the Authors
Lorraine Young is a founding member of the DotNetNuke Core Team and a
member of the DNN Help Project team. Lorraine began her IT career in 1999
when she cofounded a Web development company with her coauthor and
husband, Philip Beadle. When the company decided to use DNN exclusively
for Web site development, Lorraine undertook the task of writing a user
manual for her clients and then decided to share it with the DNN community
in a bid to expose DNN to a wider audience. Lorraine continues to provide
free user help by writing the DNN online help as well as through her personal
Web site, www.dnnangel.com. She holds a bachelor of arts in professional
writing and literature and a post-graduate degree in orientation and mobility
for visually impaired adults and children. Lorraine lives in Melbourne,
Australia and works as an independent consultant.
Philip Beadle is a founding member of the DotNetNuke Core Team, a member
of the DNN Help Project team, and a Microsoft Certified Application Developer
(MCAD). He began his IT career in 1997 developing risk analysis software for
the Australian oil and gas industry. In 1999, he founded a Web development
company that focused on solutions using the application of the DNN frame-
work. He is currently employed by Readify (www.readify.net) as a consul-
tant. Philip runs a personal Web site for .NET developers at www.philip
beadle.net and blogs regularly on an environmentally focused Web site
(www.hitechandgreen.com), which he initiated in 2006.
Scott Willhite is the COO of DotNetNuke Corporation. Scott’s technology
pedigree is distinguished, including a bachelor of science in computer sci-
ence and MBA in information systems management from Baylor University.
Scott has 20 years of technology experience as senior manager and technical
architect for Andersen Consulting (now Accenture), CTO and VP of Tech-
nology for 10x Labs, and program director for Safeco’s Office of the CIO. He’s
architected, developed, and managed systems built on technologies ranging
from COBOL to Java and .NET, solving all kinds of real-world business prob-
lems in industries from banking, insurance, utilities, and healthcare to faith-
based applications. Among other things, he oversees the Projects initiatives
at DotNetNuke, cultivating BSD licensed (unencumbered) practical applica-
tions of Microsoft technology and programming for the world. Scott currently
resides in Seattle, Washington with his lovely wife Allison and son Kyle (the
first and best loves of his life) and a host of crazy pets, neighbors, and friends
that he wouldn’t trade for gold.
Chris Paterra is a founding member of the DotNetNuke Core Team who
works for a .NET development shop in Atlanta, Georgia as lead architect. He
is the project leader of the popular Forum and Gallery modules for

DotNetNuke and also aids in the agile development of the DotNetNuke Core
project itself. He has written magazine articles on managing the projects,
coauthored the DotNetNuke Professional Portals 4.x, and is currently writing
a book titled Professional DotNetNuke Modules. His community involvement
has earned him the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET for 2007.

Dedication
To our loving parents and everyone who has generously given a moment of
their time to support and grow the DNN community. Nice work, team!

Introduction
W
elcome to the world of DotNetNuke!
DotNetNuke is not just a great piece of free (yes, free!) software: It’s your key
to a vibrant and ever-changing community of software users, designers, and
developers. How deeply you choose to get involved with the DotNetNuke
world is up to you. If you opt for little involvement, you can simply download
the code or find a hosting provider who can set you up with a domain and
hosting where you can build your DotNetNuke Web site. In fact, you may
never visit the official DotNetNuke Web site! Alternatively, if you do catch the
DotNetNuke bug, you may find yourself taking the red pill along with many
other excited and dedicated community members and seeing just how deep
the rabbit hole goes.
DotNetNuke (DNN) is a Content Management System (CMS) that enables 
you to build and maintain dynamic Web sites by using a Web browser. It’s a
powerful tool that can meet most business or personal Web site needs, as
well as being customizable to suit specific requirements. DNN is supported
by a dedicated and ever-growing community of computer users who are 
constantly improving the product, creating complementary add-ons and ser-
vices, as well as offering their time and support to you and other DNN users.
Because it’s an open-source project, there is always a lot going on in the
DotNetNuke world. Companies and individuals offer help and advice, free
resources are available on the DotNetNuke Web site, and helpful blogs, Web
sites, and movies are everywhere!
So with so much help everywhere, why are we writing this book? 
First, this book has been written to provide you with a simple entry path 
into using DNN. This book helps you to get familiar with the fundamental 
concepts of DNN, guides you through the basics of building a Web site, and
points you to other Web sites where you can find more information.
Second, this book aims to plug you in to the wider world of DNN where 
an ever-growing range of free and commercial resources including content,
content management, Web site design, and hosting services are available to
enhance your DNN experience.

Foolish Assumptions
On the whole, we wrote this book for beginners who may have never built a
Web site before. In this book, we do assume readers know how to find files on
their own computers and have used a Web site browser to surf the Internet at
least a few times.
The book does, however, include a couple of chapters in which we do assume
readers know a lot more about technology. These chapters are included to
give the children in your household some light reading material, but they 
can be a bit more challenging for adults. The information contained in these
chapters is not required to build a Web site. Chapter 2 and Chapter 11 assume
readers have an understanding of computer system administration such as
Internet Information Server (IIS) and Internet protocols such as File Transfer
Protocol (FTP). These chapters are for readers who have existing technical
knowledge in these areas and want to find out how to apply it to DNN.
How To Use This Book
This book is developed to assist with the building and maintaining of Web
sites by using DNN. If you read the book from start to finish, it walks you
through the full DNN journey beginning with downloading the free software,
installing it on your Web service, configuring the basic settings, adding pages
and content to your Web site, tweaking settings, and exploring the wider
DotNetNuke community. However, we realize that your own personal DNN
journey may be quite different from this depending upon whether you set up
your own DNN, buy it installed from a hosting company, or are provided with
a DNN Web site by your company’s IT department. As such, you don’t need to
read the book from start to finish, but begin wherever you pick up the baton.
We recommend that readers who are being introduced to DNN for the first
time read Chapter 1, which outlines the fundamentals, introduces common
terminology, and provides an understanding of the way the DNN community
operates. From there, you are free to pick and mix your chapters as you need!
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you get the most out of this book, we follow a few simple typographi-
cal conventions. Text that you have to type appears in boldface. Programming
code or URLs appear in a monospaced font. Clickable links are underlined.

DotNetNuke For Dummies 

A Note on the Different Versions of DNN
This book will be useful for readers with any DNN 3 or DNN 4 version.
Versions of DotNetNuke change rapidly. Typically, three new versions of DNN
are released each year. Each new version typically contains new features,
improvements to security and speed as well as takes advantage of new fea-
tures in the Microsoft .NET platform.
The numbering of versions works like this: The first version of DNN was
called Version 1 and is written as DNN (01.00.00). Each time a major change 
is made to a version, the number changes like this: DNN (1.01.00), DNN
(1.02.00), DNN (1.03.00), and so on. Each time a minor change is made to a
version, the number changes like this: DNN (1.00.01), DNN (1.00.02), DNN
(1.00.03), and so on. Sometimes minor versioning skips a few numbers, say,
from DNN (1.00.01) to DNN (1.00.03). This happens when minor version
changes are made but not released for download to the public.
This book uses the fourth major release of DNN Version 4, which is DNN
(04.04.00). This is the latest version available at the time of writing. Readers
with an earlier or a later version of DNN will find small variations on how
tasks are performed as well as different features.
How This Book Is Organized
Whether you are planning to use DNN to build a personal Web site, a single
business Web site, or to manage multiple Web sites, this book guides you
through all the steps required to set up and create one or more dynamic 
Web sites by using DNN.
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke
Power Source
This section is about getting started with DNN and is written for a mixed
audience.
Chapter 1 covers all the definitions and the basic foundational concepts to
understand DotNetNuke. It also explains a little bit about open source and
why that aspect of DNN is important to a user right now. We recommend that
everyone read this chapter.
3
Introduction

Chapter 2 covers installing DNN on a Web server for more advanced readers
who intend to download the DNN software and install it themselves.
Chapter 3 covers how to configure the general settings of DNN before you
begin building your Web site. If you have purchased a single Web site from 
a hosting company, you don’t need to read this chapter.
Part II: Putting the Power 
of DotNetNuke to Work
This section covers the building of the Web site. It covers the main activities
of the portal Administrator, including how to create pages and add content to
the Web site as well as how to create registered Web site users and control
which users can see which information. The section is written sequentially,
with each chapter covering a slightly more complex task or tool. Mastering
this Part means that you are a skilled DNN Administrator.
Part III: Jumping to Light 
Speed with DotNetNuke
This section kicks Web site administration up a notch. It covers the more
advanced content modules that enable your Web site users to interact with
the Web site by submitting their feedback, participating in forums, subscrib-
ing to newsletters and more.
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood
This section is for readers who want to delve deeper into customizing, 
personalizing, and improving the experience of users. It explains how to 
customize the wording of automated e-mail messages sent out by DNN, how
to enable users to change the language of certain information, and ways to
customize the registration and login experience.
This section also demonstrates how to undertake routine maintenance and
support activities for your Web site.

DotNetNuke For Dummies 

Part V: The Part of Tens
This section has three lists of ten. The first two lists are a sampler platter of
the numerous content modules that you can add to your Web site. One lists
really cheap or free modules and the other lists modules that cost a bit more
money. The third list is a supplement to the Forum module and lists ten fun
things for forum users.
Icons Used in This Book
This icon means that we’re mentioning some really nifty point or idea that
you may want to keep in mind as you use DNN.
This icon lets you know something you’ll want to keep in mind. If you forget it
later, that’s fine, but if you remember it, it will make your DotNetNuke life a
little easier.
If you skip all the other icons, pay attention to this one. Why? Because ignor-
ing it could cause something really, really bad or embarrassing to happen,
like when you were sitting in your second-grade classroom waiting for the
teacher to call on you to answer a question, and you noticed that you still
had your pajama shirt on. We don’t want that to happen to you!
This icon shows up when thing get a bit technical. You may need to seek the
assistance of a .NET developer or someone with knowledge of Web site hosting.

D
otNetNuke revolutionizes common notions of consumer-oriented Web
publishing by putting enormous power, affordably, into the hands of 
regular people. Whereas most tools for creating Web sites just let you type a
little text and change a few colors and graphics, DotNetNuke makes it possi-
ble for anyone to secure private information, host interactive content, and
transact real business.
One of the great things about the Internet is that it levels the playing field
when it comes to competing with the big boys. Whether you are a private
individual, a sole proprietor, or a small business owner, an interactive Web
site that engages your audience can project an image of professionalism pre-
viously achievable only by a much larger company. However, the inverse of
that statement is also true: Many Web sites of large companies, even interna-
tional conglomerates, are so woefully sleep-inducing that nobody will remem-
ber where they are, much less care to return to them.
If the Internet is teaching us one thing, it’s that value is vastly increased
through interaction. That means that your Web site should not only share
your own information, but make it possible for others who share interest in
that information to expand upon it, comment on it, rate it, add to it, subscribe
to it, e-mail it, and so on.
The good news is DotNetNuke.
Don’t worry; despite its name, DotNetNuke won’t blow up! Most computer
geeks can glean a bit of understanding from the name DotNetNuke. However,
for those of us with jobs that involve actually interacting with customers,
selling goods and services, or otherwise getting out of a cubicle once in a
while, don’t worry, there is some rhyme and reason to it!

In its earliest incarnation, now many generations past, DotNetNuke had many
features in common with some open-source applications that ran on the
Linux platform. The most popular of those had names that included the term
“Nuke” prefaced by some acronym or word describing aspects of the technol-
ogy the solution was based on (for example, phpNuke, PostNuke, and so on).
Internet applications that run on a Microsoft platform utilize a technology
called .NET (pronounced “dot net”). Hence, the name DotNetNuke was born.
DotNetNuke Is More than 
Web Publishing
DNN offers online editing rather than push-publishing, which means it allows
you to create and manage Web pages and their content by using a Web site
browser. Instead of building a Web site by creating Web site pages on your
computer and then uploading these pages to a Web site server, DNN allows
you to build and maintain your Web site live on the Internet — simply by 
logging in to the Web site and adding your changes.
Throughout this book, we refer to Web sites as portals, and when you are
logged in as the host user, you’ll see that DNN refers to Web sites as portals
too. The terms portal and Web site are interchangeable.
DotNetNuke is a Content Management System (CMS). The online encyclope-
dia Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.com) defines a CMS as “a computer software
system used to assist its users in the process of content management. A CMS
facilitates the organization, control, and publication of a large body of docu-
ments and other content, such as images and multimedia resources.” Sounds
right to us!
The main benefits of a CMS are that it helps you organize your content and
gives you ideas of what you should add to your Web site. It’s kind of like the
difference between having built-in cupboards versus a stack of cardboard
boxes. If you have a pile of boxes, everything is just crammed in together and
that’s that — you need time, intuition, and luck to find those red socks again.
But if you have custom-built cupboards, you’re likely to remember to store
them in the sock drawer. With the assistance of a good CMS, you quickly find
how to organize your content effectively and, more important, your Web site
visitors can easily find information.
The tag line for DotNetNuke is “It’s community, It’s content, It’s collaboration,
it’s the vibe of the thing,” which defines the key concepts of DNN.
10
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

DNN Is Community
Historically, Web sites were viewed by many people as an easy way to access
company information such as contact details or product information. A visi-
tor would come to a Web site, look around and then leave again — a bit like
an armchair tourist. However, as Web sites evolve, it has become clear that
their power and popularity lie not in the “look, but don’t touch” sphere of
brochure Web sites, but with Web sites that connect people who have
common interests and that enable people to share their thoughts and wares
with each other.
At the time of writing, the latest community Web site to take the world by
storm was http://youtube.com. YouTube members can upload and share
their videos worldwide, view thousands of videos, join interest groups, vote
for favorite videos, and more. YouTube enables everyone to be a movie star,
and the Web site offers free content and a devoted community. The good
news is that DNN enables you to build a Web site just like this — with lots of
members who can communicate, join groups, upload movies or photos or
documents, write content, and much more.
Of course, YouTube is just one example of a large and popular community —
it doesn’t necessarily reflect the kind of community you want to have access-
ing your DNN Web site. Perhaps you want to build a community that is
restricted to the staff of your company, customers of your business, or just
your family. All of this is possible with DNN because you control who can join
your community, what information they can access, and how they interact
with the Web site. When you manage a DNN Web site, you really are the king
of your domain. You can even choose to be the only member of your Web site
if you like: Be a lone ranger!
Registered users: Members and 
non-members of your Web site
Access to different areas of a DNN Web site can be controlled through mem-
bership and roles. This is one of the key concepts behind DNN. Two basic
categories of people can access your DNN Web site:
 Non-members (also referred to as visitors or unauthenticated users)
who can only look around the publicly accessible areas of your Web site.
 Members (also referred to as registered users, or authenticated users, or
users) who have logged in to the Web site and can access member-only
areas and tools. Members can manage their own details such as pass-
word, name, and contact details.
11
Chapter 1: Maximize Your Web Potential

Authentication refers to whether a person is logged in to the Web site or not.
If a person is logged in, they are called an authenticated user; if they are not
logged in, they are called an unauthenticated user. An unauthenticated user
may actually be a member, but, until they log in, DNN doesn’t know who they
are and just treats them like a stranger.
Security roles: Sorting your 
members into groups
After a person has become a registered user (member) of your DNN Web site,
they can then access a wide range of member-only pages and content. They
can join chat groups, post to members forums, subscribe to services, manage
a photo gallery, share files, or any number of other things that you choose to
let them do. You have full control over which members can do which things
on your Web site through the creation of security roles (also referred to as
roles), which permit or restrict access to view, add, edit, and delete content
on your Web site.
A role is a member’s group that you create on your Web site. You can create
as many roles as you like. After you have created these roles, you add mem-
bers to one or more of these roles, or you can set up your Web site to allow
members to add themselves. For example, you might create two roles on
your Web site, one called Friends and one called Travel Buddies. Because
Sam and Grace are your friends, you add them to the Friends role. Sam is 
also a Travel Buddy, so you can add him to that role as well. This means 
that when Grace logs in to your Web, site she can not only see the publicly
available pages of your Web site, but also any special pages and content that
is restricted to the security role called Friends, such as your Events diary.
However, when Sam logs in to your Web site, he not only can see your Events
diary for the Friends role, but he can also browse through your holiday photo
gallery, which is available to members of the Travel Buddies role.
Roles are not only used to control access to different areas of your Web site,
but they also control what members can do in each area. Using the preceding
example, say you change your mind and decide you want to allow members
of both the Friends and Travel Buddies roles to view your holiday photo
gallery. You have also decided that you want to let your Travel Buddies add
their own holiday snapshots to the gallery. Not a problem! You just need to
check and uncheck a couple of check boxes, and then your Travel Buddies
will be able to add their own snapshots, as shown in Figure 1-1. Yes, it’s really
that easy!
To find out more on how to register members and add members to roles, see
Chapter 4.

Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

DNN Is Content
After you create your DNN Web site, you need to add something for visitors 
to look at or do. Web sites consist of one of more pages with either static or
interactive content on each page. In DNN, Web pages are called pages and the
content on those pages is maintained through building blocks called modules.
DNN Web pages
A DNN Web site consists of as many pages as you like. A page in DNN consists
of a skin that controls the look and feel of the page and modules that display
the content of the page. Skins and modules are covered in the next two sec-
tions, “DNN modules,” and “A designer’s delight.” To add a new page, simply
click the Add button on the left side of the Control Panel shown in Figure 1-2
and fill out the form. Your new page is now added to your Web site and you
can now add modules to it to complete the page.
One of the best features of a DNN Web site is that when you add a new page,
it is automatically added to the navigation menu of the Web site. If you have
ever built a Web site before, you may have had the experience of the wasted
time that occurs when you add a new page to a Web site and then need to
also change the navigation menu on each Web page to include the new page.
This manual system can cause people to avoid changing their Web site,
which leads to a stagnant and boring Web site. Not so with DNN. You can add,
edit, hide, and delete pages at any time and the dynamic navigation menu is
always up-to-date.

Roles page,

site roles.

Chapter 1: Maximize Your Web Potential

DNN modules
The content of a DNN Web site is displayed on each page by using modules. A
module is a discrete piece of functionality that you can add to a page to show
content. For example, if you want to show a list of documents on your Web
site, you simply select the Documents module from the drop-down list in the
center of the Control Panel (refer to Figure 1-2) and click the Add button next
to it. This adds the module to your page in the pane you have selected and
you can now add documents to your Web site.
After a module has been added to your page, it can then be configured by
Administrators and, where they have been given the necessary role 
access, by members. DNN ships with 27 ready-to-use modules (some of 
which work together to achieve a single goal). Many more are available from
the DotNetNuke Marketplace (http://marketplace.dotnetnuke.com/)
and from independent third-party vendors. Many of these modules are for
sale, and most vendors also have some free modules or free versions of their
commercial modules. Each module is designed to manage a particular type of
content or address a particular business need. There is a module for display-
ing movies or images (the Media module), a module for displaying a list of
hyperlinks (the Links module), and a module that enables people to e-mail
comments (the Feedback form).
The layout of your Web site is designed by adding one or more modules to a
page. By combining different modules, you can create an endless number of
unique pages. Modules are great because they are not tied down to a page.
You can move a module to a new position on the page, move it to a new page,
display it on all pages, copy it onto another page, or delete it from a page
altogether and then add it back to another page later by retrieving it from the
Recycle Bin.

Panel is

istrators as

any role

14
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

Another benefit of modules is that they display information attractively 
and consistently on your Web site pages. For example, DNN comes with a
Documents module that displays a list of documents. Say you want to allow
all of your staff members to add new documents to your Web site. If you give
your staff access to add documents to the Documents module, they can com-
plete a simple form, click Update, and then the document is displayed on the
Web site in a uniform manner. Your staff doesn’t need to worry about how it
will look and they don’t need to know anything about how to build Web
pages. The task is simple and the result is consistent and professional.
Not only is it very easy to discover how to add new documents or announce-
ments to a module, but it’s also very simple to edit existing items in the module.
If the module is one that has many items in it, such as the Documents module,
you can edit an existing document record by clicking the edit icon next to the
record, as shown in Figure 1-3.
If the module is one that only has one record, such as the Text/HTML module,
all you have to do is mouse over the Module menu and click Edit Text, as
shown in Figure 1-3 on the right.

Chapter 1: Maximize Your Web Potential

A designer’s delight
One of the central purposes of a good Content Management System is to keep
the design of the Web site separate from the content that is added to the Web
site. Achieving this separation enables the content to be changed at any time
without modifying the design; likewise, you can modify the design without
affecting the content. DNN is an absolute winner on this front.
If you have ever collaborated on a document, you know how difficult it can
be to keep a standard look and feel. One person makes a heading large,
another uses Styles to control the headings, and yet another person makes
the headings bold. By the end of the process, the document can look like a
dog’s breakfast and any sense of professionalism or corporate branding has
left the building. For this reason, separating the design from the content is
the right way to go. If people cannot fiddle with the design, they will simply
add their information and get back to their work. There are many examples of
Web sites on the Internet that look cheap and tacky because they don’t have
a consistent design across the Web site.
Design in DNN is called skinning. When you want to add a design to your DNN
Web site, you simply slip a new skin onto it, and voilà! A skin sets the layout of
the page, controls the colors of the page, and controls the standard colors and
sizes of text and headings on the page, as shown in Figure 1-4. A skin is made
up of an HTML file, a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), some images, and maybe a
configuration file. When these files are packaged up into a skin, which comes as
a compressed .ZIP file, you can install these skins onto your Web site with a few
clicks. A skin package has two main elements: One or more page skins and one
or more module containers. A page skin is the design for the whole page, and
the module container is the design for a single module.
Figure 1-4:
This image
shows a
DNN Web
site page
with
different
module
containers
set on each
module.
16
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

DNN skinning is completely mix and match. You can have the same page and
module container design across all pages and modules on the Web site, you
can have the same page design with different module container designs for
each module, or you can have a different skin for every page of your Web site.
It’s all up to you! Because design is separate from content, you can change
your design at any time. For example, if your Web site is celebrating its
anniversary, you can change the module container design on the Home page
to a special anniversary design, or you might like to change the design for the
whole Web site. All of this is possible with only a few clicks. Here are some
other features of skins:
 Skins have one or more panes that modules can be added to.
 When you are logged in as the administrator, you can view the layout of
the skin, which is displayed as a gray dotted line table with the name of
each pane displayed at the top of each pane, as shown in Figure 1-5.
 The names of the panes show up in the drop-down list of Panes in the
Control Panel, as shown in the center of Figure 1-2.
DNN Is Collaboration
In the “DNN Is Community” section earlier in this chapter, we discuss the con-
cept of allowing members to join your Web site to create a community and
how, by adding those members to one or more roles, you can control access
to pages and modules.
Figure 1-5:

panes

modules to;

only two
panes have
modules

them.

Chapter 1: Maximize Your Web Potential

Here’s how to set permissions to a page:
1. Log in to your Web site.
See “Logging in to your DNN Web site” later in this chapter.
2. Click the Settings button or link in the Page Functions area of the
Control Panel.
This opens the settings page for this page, which is called Page
Management.
3. Select or deselect any role in either the View Page or Edit Page
columns of the Permissions section, as shown in Figure 1-6.
This is how easy it is to change access to pages of your Web site. Note
that you cannot remove the Administrator permission; otherwise, you
won’t be able to manage your whole Web site.
4. Click the Update link.
These new permissions are now set. See Chapter 3 for more details on
working with pages and modules.
Special roles: Administrator and host roles
Roles not only control what visitors and members can see and do on your
Web site, roles also provide members with access to do more powerful things
on your Web site such as add new pages, manage communities, change the
design of a page, or even manage the whole Web site. Roles can either pro-
vide members with just a little bit of access or a whole lot of power— and it’s
all up to you!
Figure 1-6:

and module
has a
Settings
page that
enables you
to maintain

view or edit
the page or

Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

One of the special roles on your Web site is the Administrator (also known 
as the Portal Administrator, Site Administrator, or Admin). Most of this book
is written from the perspective of the Administrator, so chances are that if
you are reading this book, you may well have administration rights to a DNN
Web site. Administrators have full access and absolute power to build and
modify all pages of a DNN Web site. DNN Web sites are created with only one
Administrator, who is then able to assign more members to the Administrator
role if they choose.
As you can see in Figure 1-7, DNN offers lots of tools to help you manage all
aspects of your Web site. These tools are explained in detail throughout this
book, but here’s a quick explanation of what each of the tools allows you to do:
 Site Settings: Here you can do things like change the title of your site,
enter keywords and a description for search engines, change your skins,
and set your default time zone.
 Pages: Pages lets you manage your navigation menu by moving pages
around. You can also access any of your pages directly from here.
 Security Roles: Add, edit, and delete your user groups here. You can set
whether your users can subscribe to a role and you can set the cost for
a subscription.
 User Accounts: Here you can add, edit, and delete users on your site.
You can also access the profiles of your users, manage their passwords,
and look after which security roles they are members of.
 Vendors: DNN has a cool system for allowing you to manage advertising
on your site. You do this by managing your vendors, banners, and affili-
ates here.
 Site Log: DNN records heaps of information about who is using your
Web site, when they are using it, what pages they got to, and what sort
of browser they are using. You can access 12 reports about the use of
your site here.
 Newsletters: Part of managing a Web site is keeping in contact with your
members. Newsletters allows you to easily send e-mails to your mem-
bers with a few clicks.
 File Manager: Content is what your site’s about! The File Manager gives
you a familiar way to manage files and folders on your Web site.
 Recycle Bin: Whoops, didn’t mean to delete that? The Recycle Bin will
save the day and allow you to restore modules and pages.
 Log Viewer: Want to know what’s going on behind the scenes on your
site? The Log Viewer records 47 different events that occur on your site.
 Skins: Upload new designs to your site and easily apply them on the
Skins page.

 Languages: You can change the words that describe anything on a DNN
site here. If you want to change the word Cell on the registration form to
Mobile Phone, this is where you do it.
 Authentication: If you are using DNN in an intranet, this is where you
can set up Windows Authentication.
If an Administrator is the queen of her Web site domain, the superuser or
host is the mistress of all domains. There is only one Host Account for the
whole of your DNN installation and, like the Admin, the host can add new
superusers. The host can build whole new Web sites within the one DNN
installation, manage files that can be shared across all Web sites, and can
control what types of content and files are available on a Web site.
Figure 1-8 shows the extra tools available to superusers. These tools are
explained in detail throughout this book, but here’s a quick explanation of
what each of the tools allows you to do:
 Host Settings: See Chapter 3 for a rundown on the host settings.
 Portal: Add new Web sites to your DNN installation and manage existing
sites here.
 Module Definitions: See what modules are currently installed and what
version they are here. You can also install new modules and get new ver-
sions of modules here.

Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

 File Manager: This is the very similar to the File Manager in the Admin
menu, except these files are for the superuser.
 Vendors: Here you can manage vendors just like under the Admin menu,
except these vendors are available to every portal in your installation.
 SQL: If you know how to write SQL, you can execute it here. Be careful
with SQL: It’s a very powerful tool and, used wrongly, can break DNN.
 Schedule: DNN has some tasks that run in the background that look
after the database for you. Here you can see how they are going by
checking the History of the item.
 Languages: This is a more powerful version of the Languages tool under
Admin.
 Search Admin: Manage how you want the DNN search to work and show
its results.
 Lists: Many parts of DNN use lists to give you options. Here you can look
after those lists of information.
 Superusers Accounts: This is a separate list of users who have access 
to every feature of DNN, including the host menu tools.
 Skins: Manage the skins that are available to all sites in your installa-
tion here.

Chapter 1: Maximize Your Web Potential

Logging in to your DNN Web site
If you have a DNN Web site already installed, you can log in now and see how
the look of the Web site changes based upon your role access.
1. Click the Login link.
This link is usually located at the top of every page, usually on the 
right side.
2. Enter your username into the User Name text box.
The out-of-the-box username for the Web site Administrator is Admin.
Unless you have been given a different username, this is what you will
enter here.
3. Enter your password into the Password text box.
The out-of-the-box password for the Web site Administrator is dnnadmin.
Unless you have been given a different username, this is what you will
enter here.
4. Click the Login button.
You are now logged in as the Administrator of your Web site. As the
Administrator, you can build and maintain all pages, all content, and 
all settings for this Web site.
After you are logged in, you will see that the page has changed significantly.
At the top of the page is now an Admin bar, which has frequently used tools
to add pages and content. Also on the page you find small upside down trian-
gles that display popup menus when you mouse over them. The popup menu
details the features of the module. You will also see dotted lines around the
panes of the skin and the names of those panes.
If you don’t see these things but you know that you are logged in because the
words Admin Account are visible, click the Preview button on the top left of
the page to turn off Preview mode. The Preview button hides these things so
you can see what the page would look like if you weren’t logged in. This fea-
ture is very helpful during construction of your site.
Changing your login credentials
The first time you log in to your DNN Web site by using the default logins, you
should change your password to prevent others from logging in to your Web
site and adding or deleting your work. Here’s how:
1. Log in to your Web site.
2. Click the Admin Account link.
22
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

This is located wherever the Login link was before you logged in. This
displays the user account for the Web site Administrator.
3. Enter your e-mail address into the E-mail Address field.
This enables you to receive any e-mail notifications from the DNN
system, such as when you request a password reminder.
4. Click the Update link.
5. Click the Manage Password link.
6. Enter your current password into the Current Password field.
7. Enter a new password into the New Password and the Confirm
Password fields.
Note that passwords are case-sensitive.
8. Click the Change Password link.
Your new password is now set.
If you get an error that says the e-mail couldn’t be sent, go to the site and
host settings pages and update the SMTP details and the e-mail addresses.
See Chapter 3 for more on for this.
If you also have access to the host role, you will need to change the e-mail
address and password for this account too. Follow the same steps as in the
preceding list. The default host login username is host and the default pass-
word is dnnhost.
DNN serves applications, 
not just online brochures
With all this power to have members on your Web site, to provide different
levels of access to the Web site based on roles, and to distribute the mainte-
nance of content and the building of the Web site among many people, it’s no
surprise that the power of DotNetNuke goes well beyond the ability to build a
five-page Web site that give basic information about your business. Depending
on your goals, you can use DNN for a multitude of purposes, ranging from
simple static text to robust Web-based business applications. DotNetNuke
Web sites don’t just sit there: They do stuff!
DNN out of the box delivers most of the functionality required to build and
maintain a dynamic Web site, but you are not limited by this initial offering.
As well as being able to purchase modules from third-party vendors and the
DNN market place, you can also enlist the services of a DotNetNuke devel-
oper to build you a module custom designed to suit your needs. This could
be a module that interacts with your existing business systems, provides an
online quotation system for your products, or anything else you want. If you
can dream it, DNN can deliver it!
23
Chapter 1: Maximize Your Web Potential

DNN is used for many large Web sites across the world for all sorts of busi-
nesses, including national sporting Web sites (www.bigpondsport.com),
transportation Web sites (http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au), 
corporate Web sites (www.readify.net), and small to medium businesses
(www.wafex.com.au). From these examples, you can see that DNN can
deliver all kinds of information to all kinds of businesses — no matter how
large or small.
DNN gives you N for the price of 1
DNN is not just a tool that enables you to build a fabulous Web site — it is 
a tool that enables you to build 1, 2, 3, 10, 20, 30, or even 100 completely 
different and unique Web sites!
For developers, this means you can manage multiple portals on a single code-
base, with a single IP address. For those of you with an interest in running an
online Web site design business, this means you install DNN just once and
build all of your customers their own Web site by using the same instance of
DNN. And for those of you who have more modest aspirations, it means you
can host your family Web site and your small business Web site from the
same installation. Any user can create new Web sites quickly and cheaply.
You can create templates from existing Web sites and use them to stamp out
new Web sites. You can even export the content from a module on one Web
site into a module on another Web site.
Members are unique for each portal. Joining one Web site doesn’t give you
access to log in to another Web site in the same installation. All settings are
unique from one Web site to the next.
Plug in to Open Source
Open source means that the code used to build an application is freely avail-
able to be distributed and modified as desired within the limitations of the
license. Anyone can go to the DNN Web site, download the code, and use it to
build their Web site without having to ever pay one cent back to the DNN
Corporation. Amazing, huh?
The philosophy behind open source is that when a large group of people
come together and develop and freely share their ideas, knowledge, skills,
and time with each other, the quality of the application as well as the rate at
which it develops and evolves is exponentially faster than any other method
of doing so. It’s like having thousands of free developers working on your
application day and night.
24
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

Unlike with a commercial application, which you buy or have developed for your
business, the culture of open source is one of sharing, helping, and community.
DNN is developed and tested all year-round; however, the code is generally
released to the public three times each year. That means that three times
every year, thousands and thousands of hours of development work are
neatly packaged up and available for you to download — all for free!
One common myth about open source is that it isn’t secure because anyone
can look at the code. People who are new to open source often have fears sur-
rounding the security of the code. How can a Web site be safe from hackers if
they can readily look through the code and find its weaknesses? Probably the
most honest answer is that nothing is ever 100% secure! However, open source
has many advantages over closed-source projects. Because the philosophy of
open source is one of sharing and caring, it isn’t typically a place where hack-
ers go to make mischief. Instead, the golden orbs of hacking are closed propri-
etary code, or perhaps unethical global businesses. Hackers are generally
supportive of open source and the philosophy that it represents. A hacker 
who is proud that she has found a security leak is more likely to use that infor-
mation to help secure DNN, rather than hack into millions of DNN Web sites.
Another advantage here is that the DNN community openly shares information,
including any limitations. Unlike buying software from a business that wants to
keep their limitations quiet for fear of losing profits, the DNN community is all
about improving its wares for the greater good.
To find out more about open source, the Berkley System Distribution (BSD)
license that DNN uses, some of the benefits for choosing open source, and 
a business case study of open source, see http://opensource.org/
index.php.
Yes, it’s free!
There are a number of different open-source licenses in existence, but 
DNN uses the BSD license, which is one of the most liberal licenses around.
Essentially, the BSD license enables you to modify and redistribute DNN at no
cost. How is it free? It is made possible by the generous license and a synergy
of contributors.
Making the switch to thinking in an open-source mindset can be confusing for
many businesses, especially Web development companies that ask themselves,
“If it’s free, how can we make money?” The answer is through building and
maintaining Web sites for your customers as per usual; however, by choosing
DNN, you are able to save an enormous amount of time by not having to
develop it all from scratch. Instead, you have a robust and well-tested platform
that you can use straight out of the box and that grows and improves at an
incredible rate. After you have used DNN and understand its full potential,
you’re more likely to ask, “How did we ever make money without it?”
25
Chapter 1: Maximize Your Web Potential

A second question businesses may ask is “Do I have to tell my customers?”
And the answer to this is “No, not unless you want to.” Using DNN to manage
your Web sites can be your own little secret if you like. The copyright is in
the code, not in any visible portion of your site. The truth is that most people
who run a business don’t care from where or how you get the answers they
need — so long as you get them!
Watch out for “resellers”! DNN is free, so you don’t need to buy it. You need
to buy hosting and you may need to buy designs or custom-built modules,
but you don’t need to buy a license to use the code.
Based on Microsoft muscle
When people talk about open-source software, they are usually thinking
about platforms like Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP, or Python. When you put all
these applications together, you get what is called the LAMP stack. This set
of applications has been used for a long time on the Internet to host millions
of Web sites around the world. These applications are popular and cover a
large percentage of the hosting market because they are “free” and stable.
(“Free” is not really free: One of the reasons these applications are so stable
is that they are quite lightweight, which inherently makes them difficult to
manage, which in turn means you need dedicated technical staff to manage
these applications.) One of the great things about Microsoft products is that
they build a lot of management tools into their applications, thus making
them easier to manage and requiring less staff to run a hosting center. To
combat the “free” argument, Microsoft has reduced the cost of their server
applications and also introduced a pay-as-you-go licensing system that has
allowed a lot more hosting companies to offer Microsoft platform hosting.
This is a great thing for DotNetNuke because DNN needs four Microsoft
Server products to function.
The base product is called Windows Server 2003. This operating system now
runs some of the largest Web sites and networks in the world and has proven
itself to be stable, reliable, and also easy to manage. Windows Server 2003 is
now used in many large-scale Web sites that serve millions of pages an hour
and has shown that it can scale out and up to massive size and still be easily
managed by a small team of staff.
The next product needed to host a DNN site is called Internet Information
Server (IIS). This is the Web server part of the stack and is the product that
receives the requests for Web pages and then creates the HTML to send back
out to the Web browsers. You can have a look at the IIS on your home com-
puter if you are running either Windows XP Professional or Windows Vista.
You can install it under Windows Update Components on the Add/Remove
Programs dialog box. IIS is quite simple to use and makes it easy for a hosting
company to provision new Web sites quickly and with a minimum of effort.
26
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

DotNetNuke is written in a programming language called ASP.NET, using the
Visual Basic language. For IIS to be able to understand these instructions, 
the .NET Framework needs to be installed on the server. DNN comes in two
flavors: DNN3.x.x for the .NET 1.1 Framework and DNN 4.x.x for the .NET 2.0
Framework. .NET 2.0 is a progression from .NET 1.1 as is DNN 4 from DNN 3.
DNN 3 has been “sunsetted” and no further development is occurring on that
code base.
Now that we have an operating system (Windows Server 2003), a Web server
(Internet Information Server), and an application framework (.NET 2.0), all we
need to finish off our stack to run DNN is Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or 2005.
This product is a database server: It stores the data for your sites and allows
users of DNN to easily add new pages, modules, and content to their Web
sites. SQL Server is an enterprise-level database and is capable of storing
huge amounts of data while still remaining responsive to the user. Microsoft
has spent a large amount of money improving the performance of SQL Server
because it forms an integral part of many applications. There is also a free
version called SQL Server Express edition that you can download from the
Microsoft site to try out if you like.
The pay-as-you-go licensing Microsoft has introduced is called SPLA (Service
Provider License Agreement). This method of licensing is designed to encour-
age hosting companies to provide Microsoft hosting solutions. The license
allows them to pay monthly on a per-user basis, which means there is no
upfront cost and they can be profitable from the beginning.
A thriving community
By choosing DNN, you are joining a thriving and rapidly expanding ecosystem
of users and suppliers. Each time a new user joins DNN, this adds to the
demand for newer and improved features — which in turn spurs more 
innovation that attracts additional users.
The DNN community is a friendly bunch of people from around the world
with a common interest in using and building DNN Web sites. DNN commu-
nity members have a range of different needs and skill levels. Members range
from individuals who just want to use DNN for their own personal Web site,
to IT professionals who are using DNN to manage Web sites as part of their
paid employment, to IT professionals who are using DNN as their Web devel-
opment or Web hosting businesses. And the good news is that everyone is
welcome, so don’t be shy!
It is often commented on in the DNN online help forums that the DNN 
community is one of the most friendly and helpful online communities in the
technology field. It is rare to find people being sarcastic, angry, or unkind. As
such, DNN is the perfect tool for beginners because you quickly find out that
no question is too small and no reasonable request is too large.
27
Chapter 1: Maximize Your Web Potential

Blink and the world isn’t likely to change too much, unless it’s the DNN world!
There are two main sections of DNN — the core framework and the add-ons that
are essentially content modules and design skins. The DNN framework comes
with 27 (and growing) high-quality free modules developed by the DotNetNuke
Corporation itself, as well as a small number of basic skin designs.
There are also many more to be had from other providers, both free and fully
commercial. This ability for development houses to build custom modules is
a popular business model in the DNN community and is one of the many
ways people choose to make money.
Every day someone out there in the DNN community has an idea for a new
module they want to build or a skin they want to design. These may or may
not be given away for free — depending on who the person is or why they
were created — but every day across the wide world of DNN, something new
is being developed. The good news is that these resources are always avail-
able at very affordable prices. See Chapters 12 and 13 for some examples.
Be careful when you are interacting with the DNN community: It can become
very addictive when you get started! Soon you may find yourself answering
questions rather than asking them and giving back just a tiny slice of your
own time to the community that makes life so easy. Please do!
Finding Help Only a Hyperlink Away
There are a number of ways that you can receive help for DNN. One great way
to get started with DNN is by taking the DNN Guided Tour, as shown in Figure
1-9. The Guided Tour is a very simple-to-understand 20-page Web site that
will assist even the freshest DNN beginner to understand the principles of
pages, modules, and the basics of using a DNN Web site (www.dotnetnuke.
com/guidedtour/).
DotNetNuke provides free online help service on their Web site, shown in
Figure 1-10, which is regularly updated. This is a great resource that includes
how-to tutorials on nearly every function in DNN. Furthermore, the Online
Help is also available in a downloadable PDF format for a small fee http://
dotnetnuke.com/About/DotNetNukeOnlineHelp/tabid/787/
Default.aspx.
The DotNetNuke Web site runs a wide number of forums where you can ask
questions about how to install DNN, how to use DNN and its modules, and
how to develop for DNN, as shown in Figure 1-11. A number of other forums
enable community members to find out about the future direction of DNN, to
share information about resources and cool DNN Web sites, and lots more
(http://dotnetnuke.com/Community/ForumsDotNetNuke/tabid/
795/Default.aspx).

Installing DotNetNuke
In This Chapter
 Selecting the proper DotNetNuke installation package
 Getting DotNetNuke to your server via FTP
 Configuring your database connection string
 Troubleshooting your DotNetNuke installation
B
efore you can install DotNetNuke, you are faced with many decisions,
such as determining where you want your Web site hosted, which
ASP.NET framework you will be working with, and how much time you want
to spend managing your Web site. This chapter helps answer some of the
questions you encounter when first getting started, as well as outlines the
various tasks you need to perform in order to get your DotNetNuke Web site
up and running.
Making Decisions about 
Your DNN Installation
Faced with so many decisions prior to installation of DotNetNuke, you might
find yourself in a quandary. This section of this chapter helps walk you
through the decision-making process that is necessary to tailor your
DotNetNuke installation to your preferences.
Which file do I download?
The first decision you need to make is which version of DotNetNuke you want
to use. Because you are just starting your Web site, you should start with the
newest version of DotNetNuke available at the time. This is normally your
best option for new Web sites because any bugs or errors found in previous
version are probably corrected in the latest version. Although the new ver-
sion itself may contain a bug because of new changes, you should have some

confidence in the fact that each release is tested by a private team of testers
for a period of two to four weeks. Real-world people who use DotNetNuke for
their business or personal Web sites conduct these tests, known as beta tests.
This group of testers has a stake in finding and correcting these bugs prior to
an official release and therefore helps identify problems before they are seen
in the mainstream.
ASP.NET framework and DotNetNuke version
DotNetNuke is dependent on Microsoft’s ASP.NET framework. The ASP.NET
framework is a set of common functionality and methods utilized by develop-
ers to increase the speed of application development. It is freely distributed
by Microsoft for the Windows operating system and is a solid foundation for
any application running on a Microsoft Windows computer.
Since DotNetNuke’s inception, Microsoft has released a new major version of
the framework. When originally developed, DotNetNuke was dependent on
version 1.0 of the ASP.NET framework. Not long after DotNetNuke’s first offi-
cial release on the ASP.NET 1.0 framework, an updated ASP.NET version 1.1
was released. This minor revision was a very slight change and far from a
complete overhaul of the ASP.NET framework. In October of 2005, however,
Microsoft released version 2.0 of their framework. With version 2.0, Microsoft
made changes to the framework that forced developers to alter how certain
things were accomplished via their programming.
Because of these changes and the fact that not all businesses or individuals
want to adapt new technology or a new framework version so shortly after its
release, DotNetNuke decided to release different major versions. This was
done to allow adapters of the new framework to work with it yet still maintain
the DotNetNuke versions running on the previous ASP.NET framework ver-
sion. The major versions of DotNetNuke are 3 and 4. All DotNetNuke versions
prior to 4 run on the ASP.NET framework version 1.1, whereas all DotNetNuke
versions starting with a 4 run on the ASP.NET framework version 2.0.
Distribution packages
In addition to the versions available of DotNetNuke for download, you also
need to understand what distribution packages are. Distribution packages are,
simply put, sets of files for DotNetNuke tailored to a specific situation. The
specific situations are one of three scenarios: New Installation, Upgrade of 
an Existing Installation, and Developer Setup.
The New Installation scenario is the one you are most likely to encounter
when first getting started. These distribution packages are labeled Install
and contain only the files necessary to run DotNetNuke on a Web server. 
The Upgrade scenario is very similar and contains almostall the same files 
as the Install distributions, with the exception of a special configuration file
named Web.Config. (We discuss the Web.Config file in the “Preinstallation
32
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

Configuration” section later in this chapter.) These distribution packages
have Upgrade in the name. The important difference to understand here is
that this Web.Config file is not included in the Upgrade distribution package
so that users won’t replace the existing Web.Config file. Replacing this file
when you don’t intend to can cause all kinds of problems: The current site
may break, users may not be able to log in, configuration changes to
DotNetNuke and how it operates can occur, and, finally, it can cause you 
to lose important information that connects DotNetNuke to its database.
The third scenario, Developer Setup, is the one tailored to developers. This is
actually broken out into two separate distribution packages: Source and Starter
Kit. These distribution packages are distributed so developers can download
and develop DotNetNuke. The reason for two separate packages is that each
one is tailored for a specific developer toolset. The Starter Kit was designed 
to allow developers who use Microsoft’s Visual Web Developer Express to 
program this tool, whereas the Source distribution was designed to work with
Visual Studio .NET. If you are working with the ASP.NET framework version 1.1,
and therefore DotNetNuke version 3, Visual Studio 2003 is required. If you are
using the ASP.NET 2.0 framework, you need to use Visual Studio 2005. You
should note that there is no Starter Kit distribution for the DotNetNuke 3 series
because Visual Web Developer Express utilizes the ASP.NET 2.0 framework and
has no ASP.NET 1.1 framework version counterpart.
Putting it all together
At this point, you should have a good idea of which distribution package and
version is right for you. If you are still in doubt, start with the install distribu-
tion package for the latest DotNetNuke version released. To get the distribu-
tion package, go to www.DotNetNuke.com and register. After receiving an
e-mail with your registration code, log in to the Web site and proceed to the
download section of the Web site. Click on the Download links to obtain the
distribution package you’ve chosen.
Choosing a Web host
When it comes to Web hosting, there is no shortage of companies offering
this service, so choosing the right Web host is an important step in getting
you closer to installing DotNetNuke. Your host should offer the following:
 Windows hosting
 ASP.NET hosting
 The ASP.NET framework version you plan on using
 Microsoft SQL Server 2000/2005 or 2005 Express database hosting
33
Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

The above bullet points are requirements; however, you should also consider
these other items before choosing a host. These services help you get the
most out of your Web host:
 E-mail services
 Managed backups
 FTP access
 E-commerce/SSL abilities
 A sizable drive space allotment
 A large database space size allotment
 Affordable cost
 Support
 Adequate bandwidth
 DotNetNuke experience
You probably want to have e-mail available at your registered domain. If the
registrar you bought the domain name from is not currently hosting your
e-mail, you should get this as an added service in your hosting package. You
also want to find out ahead of time the limitations on disk space size along
with how much database space you are allotted. The exact requirements 
vary depending on how busy your site will be and how you plan to use it.
If you plan to process payments on your Web site, you may need to obtain an
SSL certificate, which means you need to make sure that the host you choose
supports e-commerce capabilities. Also, when selecting a host, you should
educate yourself on the company’s support policies as well as their experi-
ence in hosting DotNetNuke. You can always go to the DotNetNuke Web site
and browse through some of the ads on the site to see a few of the hosts who
are experienced in hosting DotNetNuke.
Last but not least is the cost factor. This varies greatly depending on which
services you need, how busy your site is, as well as how much management
you are doing on your own. You can find DotNetNuke hosting for as little as
five dollars a month; on the other hand, some hosts charge over several hun-
dred per month. The average DotNetNuke install combined with the most
common services necessary to run any business online should probably run
from $10 to $50 per month.
Now that you know how to choose the proper distribution package and Web
host, the rest of this chapter is much more hands-on. We show you how to
move files and alter their content to get your DotNetNuke Web site up and
running. You should note that not all remaining sections pertain to your par-
ticular hosting situation. All commonly encountered aspects of the various
hosting situations are discussed in the remainder of this chapter, so feel free
to skip sections that don’t pertain to your situation.
34
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

Getting DotNetNuke to Your Server
If your host does not set up the DotNetNuke Web site for you, you need to
somehow get the DotNetNuke distribution package you downloaded to your
Web host. This section of the chapter discusses the most common way of
doing that.
When a Web hosting company sets you up as a new client, one of the first
things they typically provide you is a series of usernames and passwords to
access your space on the Web for administration purposes. The first combi-
nation of these usernames and passwords normally gives you the ability to
access your account on the Web. At this point, some Web hosts also provide
you FTP login information, whereas others require you to log in to your
account management Web site to retrieve this information.
FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a standard method for transferring large 
files across the Internet. It has also become the standard in the Web hosting
industry for Web hosting customers to transfer files to their Web server. 
All the files needed for a Web site to function properly must be transferred 
to the Web host so that they can be viewed by an Internet browser, such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer, for viewing Web pages, images, and so on. To
transfer files by using FTP, you need an FTP client program installed on your
computer. If you do not have an FTP client installed, there are many free or
trial versions available for you to get started with. Check out www.download.
com to explore some of these clients. This chapter focuses on using a freely
available open source FTP client named FileZilla, which can be found at
http://filezilla.sourceforge.net.
When using FTP, you need the FTP URL to connect to, a username, a pass-
word, and, in some cases, a port to configure your FTP client to use. All the
items you need to connect using an FTP client are usually provided by the
Web host. If your Web host does not specify a port for use in your FTP client,
it is fairly safe to assume the port is 21, which is the standard port used by
FTP clients and servers for transferring data.
After you have the FTP login information, the next item on the agenda is to
take the unzipped DotNetNuke install and transfer the extracted files to the
Web server. An unzipped DotNetNuke install is the set of files extracted from
the DotNetNuke .ZIP file you downloaded in the “Which file do I download?”
section of this chapter. You can extract the files from a .ZIP file by right-click-
ing the .ZIP file and selecting Extract.
To transfer the files, connect to the remote Web server by using an FTP client
along with the information provided by the hosting company for authentica-
tion. In most hosting scenarios, when you connect by using an FTP client, you
are placed in what is called the root level directory.
35
Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

Use the FTP authentication information given to you by your hosting com-
pany to populate the login screen within your FTP client. Figure 2-1 is an
example of what a typical FTP client login screen looks like when using an
FTP client application’s Site Manager. You should use the Site Manager
instead of the other option, Quick Connect, so you don’t have to keep search-
ing for that e-mail from the hosting company. Quick Connect allows you to
connect to the remote server but doesn’t save the information for later.
The root level directory is normally the root level for the Web site; in other
words, the root level for a Web site is the directory on the remote Web server
where calls via a Web browser look for the Web site. What this means to you
is that when you type in www.yourdomain.com in a Web browser, the Web
browser is directed to this root level directory and looks for pages to display.
In some Web hosting provider setups, you may have a folder level directly
below this root level directory. Typically, these directories are named similar to
your domain name given to the Web hosting company at the time of your origi-
nal purchase of the hosting service. Using the www.yourdomain.com example
again, this directory should be named something similar to yourdomain or
yourdomain_com. Just keep in mind that if this scenario of the extra level of
folders applies to you, your root Web site level is actually within that folder.
After identifying your root level Web site folder, the next task is to transfer
the contents of your downloaded DotNetNuke .ZIP file to the remote Web
server. How this is accomplished varies depending on the FTP client you are
using, but in the more popular FTP clients used today, this is as simple as
dragging the local files and dropping them into the root level Web site folder
on the remote server from within the FTP client.

The transferring of these files may take a long time depending on the speed
of your Internet connection. Users with a broadband Internet connection can
expect times of five to ten minutes or less. Most FTP clients allow you to save
the login information so that you can connect to your remote Web server in 
a manner very similar to the way you bookmark a Web page in your Web
browser. Although you mostly need FTP access to your remote Web server
during the initial setup and configuration phase, you should save this infor-
mation for later in case you need to make configuration changes or you want
to upgrade to a newer version of DotNetNuke in the future.
When you use some form of commercial Web hosting, the host usually does 
a good job of setting things up on their end. They also tend to have tips and
tricks to help you connect to your FTP server if you are having problems.
One common problem is a conflict with a firewall setup on your home or
local business network. Most networks have the common FTP port 21 open
for outgoing usage, meaning you can connect from your local computer to
your remote FTP server. Sometimes, however, you may need to change from
what is referred to as active mode to passive mode within your FTP client. If
you are using FileZilla, click the Advanced button. A dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 2-2. Click the Use Passive Mode radio button to switch to
passive mode.
If it seems you are starting to connect, but you can’t see any files or folders
on the remote Web server after a minute, or you cannot transfer files even
though it seems you are connected, try to connect again, using the opposite
mode from the one you previously tried. In some situations, but not all, you
receive a response in the FTP client about a directory listing error. This is
normally a sign that you need to change the mode to the opposite from the
one you first tried.

Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

Setting Up IIS for DotNetNuke
If you are developing DotNetNuke, or your hosting setup is one in which 
you control the Web server, you will need to set up Microsoft’s Internet
Information server in order for your DotNetNuke Web site to be accessible
via the Internet. In most situations, however, your hosting provider will
handle this for you. Please note that if your hosting provider handles this for
you, they will also probably handle database configuration; in that case, skip
to the section entitled “Preinstallation Configuration.”
Creating a Web site in IIS Manager
If you do take on the task of server administration, you are going to have to
also know how to set up Microsoft’s Internet Information Services, or IIS, to
allow your DotNetNuke site to be displayed properly. The initial step is to
open the IIS Manager. Click Start➪Administrative Tools➪Internet Information
Services (IIS) Manager. With the IIS Manager open, you can begin creating a
new Web site by right-clicking the Web Sites folder, as shown in Figure 2-3.
This starts the Web Site Creation Wizard, which guides you through the
process of creating a new Web site. This entails first filling in a short descrip-
tion of what site this will represent. It is often a good idea to name the Web
site something similar to your domain name, but that’s not a requirement.
The important thing here is that you name it something that instantly lets
you as the Web Administrator know what this site is.
The next step in the wizard asks for the IP address to assign, as well as which
port should be used and the host header value to assign. An IP address is a
number that, in part, uniquely identifies the Web server so other computers and
devices can communicate with it. IP, or Internet Protocol, works in combination
Figure 2-3:
Creating a
new Web
site in
Microsoft’s
IIS
Manager.
38
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

with TCP, which we touch on shortly. An IP address consists of a series of num-
bers and periods that make up a set of four octets, so named because they are
based on the binary system, and are in the format of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. If your
assigned IP address looks slightly different, realize that if a 0 is at the beginning
of any of these sets, the set will not be displayed. For example, the local IP
address of 127.0.0.1 is actually 127.000.000.001.
When setting the IP address, leaving it as the default of “All Assigned” is often
acceptable, but some situations require you to select an IP address that is
accessible via the Internet. In some situations, you will have a series of local
network and Internet network IP addresses available to choose from. Most
local IP addresses start with 192 or 10, and you have to make sure that you
are using one that is available to the Internet and not just the local network,
so be careful when choosing. If you are unclear about which IP address you
should be using, contact your hosting provider.
The second field available from this screen is the TCP port the Web server
will be using to serve up your Web pages. TCP stands for Transmission
Control Protocol, which is the method that actually allows two devices 
to communicate with one another.
To translate all this jargon and help make sense of it, think of the TCP/IP com-
bination as similar to how phones work in combination with phone numbers.
The IP part of TCP/IP gives us the two phone numbers that uniquely identify
each telephone device. However, without the TCP part, there is no way for
these two phones to communicate with each other because both phones
need some type of telephone service. In this situation, the TCP part repre-
sents the active telephone service and offers the channel of communication
between the two phone numbers.
By default, the TCP port you should use is port 80. Setting the TCP port to
anything other than port 80 requires visitors who want to reach your site 
to type additional parameters after your domain name, such as www.
yourdomainname.com:8080. It is possible to use a port other than 80 
and not require users to type it in the address bar, but that varies based 
on network configuration, which is beyond the scope of this book.
If you are building a site that requires a Secure Socket Layer, usually referred
to as simply SSL, other tasks outside the scope of this book must also be han-
dled. If you would like further information about obtaining and installing SSL
certificates, please see the VeriSign Web site at www.verisign.com, where
you can not only find out more about SSL, but purchase certificates as well.
You can identify when SSL is being used on any Web site by looking at the
address bar of the Web browser. If you see https instead of the usual http, 
the Web site you are visiting has implemented SSL. SSL is often a requirement
when processing payments online from your Web site or when security is an
extremely important factor.
39
Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

Please note that sites typically only use SSL on specific pages, not the entire
Web site; therefore, this is normally handled by the Web server and does not
require you to make any changes from the default setting. Because SSL uses
TCP port 443, you may think it is necessary to set this as your TCP port, but
that is not the case: Avoid doing so unless instructed to do so by your Web
host. If you require SSL, you should discuss this with your hosting provider
to make sure that they support it and that your server is properly configured
to handle such a situation.
The final field in this screen is the host header value. This item should be 
set to the domain name of your site, including the extension, such as .com, 
in addition to the www prefix, if necessary. You may require more than one
domain name, which is why we touch on the host headers again in the next
section. For now, use www.yourdomain.com for the host headers value,
unless the www part is not available to you, or you are using a subdomain,
which looks similar to my.yourdomain.com. An example of what your
wizard screen should look like just prior to completing this step is shown 
in Figure 2-4. Click Next to advance to the next step of the wizard.
The next information the wizard requires is the home directory of your 
site. You can click the Browse button and locate the directory where your
DotNetNuke install resides. Although this can be just about anywhere on 
the computer where there is adequate space, the normal root directory is
located at C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\. Inside this directory you should create a
folder to contain your DotNetNuke files. Name it something similar to your
domain so you can easily identify it in the future. (Please keep in mind that it
is good practice to avoid using periods in the names of your folders as well.)
Click Next to advance to the next step of the wizard.
The final step requiring input from you is the Web Site Access Permissions
screen. The items set here are a set of permissions used to control how your
Web site behaves. Because DotNetNuke is an ASP.NET application, it needs
Figure 2-4:

40
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

the ability to run scripts so your Web site can be seen by others across the
Internet and make use of its functionality. Check the Run Scripts (Such As
ASP) check box and click the Next button, as shown in Figure 2-5.
The final screen in the wizard requires you to simply click the Finish button,
and then your newly created Web site is added to the list in the IIS Manager
application.
Configuring your Web site in IIS Manager
After you have created your Web site in the IIS Manager and assigned some 
of the configuration values, there are still several settings you may need 
to change to make your site viewable by the general public. What needs to 
be changed may differ depending on the configuration of the Web server.
To access these configuration items, right-click your Web site in the IIS
Manager application and select Properties. This displays the Web Site
Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-6.
Most of the items in the Web Site Properties dialog box are set with default
values that don’t need to be changed; however, others require some changes.
When the Web Site tab is selected, you see an Advanced button. Clicking this
button allows you to add additional host header values for your Web site.
Host header values are simply the various domains people can type into their
Web browsers to reach your Web site. When setting up your Web site by
using the Web Site Creation Wizard, you assigned one host header value of
www.yourdomain.com. If you want people to be able to reach your Web site
by simply typing in yourdomain.com into their Web browsers, you need to
add this as an additional host header value. Also, if you want people to reach
your site by using completely different domain names that you have regis-
tered, you have to input those domains here as well.

Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

Another tab to check here is the Documents tab. This is where you tell IIS
what Web page it should first attempt to send to Web browsers when they
type your domain into their Web browser. The one you want listed here for
DotNetNuke is Default.aspx. If this is not in the list, you need to click the Add
button and manually type it in. After Default.aspx is in your list, select it and
click the Move Up button until it is at the top of the list, as shown in Figure 2-7.

Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

When Default.aspx is at the top of the list, click the Apply button. With that
completed, the only remaining tab that requires changes is the Directory
Security tab. Click the Edit button to access another property configuration
screen, where you need to make sure that the Anonymous Access check box
is checked, as outlined in Figure 2-8. This setting allows users to view your
Web site without them entering a username and password into a popup prior
to viewing your site. Leaving this unchecked requires all users to input a
valid Windows username and password combination to view any page of
your Web site, including the default one.
With all your changes complete, click the Apply button to apply them to your
Web site. Please note that which settings need to be configured here can vary
depending on how the Web server was originally configured, but this covers
the most common items you have to change.
Setting Up the Database
One of the requirements to run DotNetNuke is access to a database. Although
you can run DotNetNuke by using various database server systems, the rec-
ommended database server is Microsoft SQL Server. You can use either ver-
sion 2000 or version 2005, but any version prior to 2000 is not supported.
There are other options available such as Microsoft’s Database Engine, also
referred to as MSDE for short, which is part of the Microsoft Office suite, but
this is normally only used in a Web development environment. In addition to
the somewhat costly Microsoft SQL Server versions 2000 and 2005, the free
option of Microsoft SQL Server Express 2005 is also available to you.

Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

Creating a new database in 
Microsoft SQL Server 2000
The first step in creating the database is making sure that you have the data-
base server program installed. This chapter assumes this has been installed 
and is properly configured for you to create new databases and database users.
After the program is installed and running, you can access the administrative
interface by clicking Start➪All Programs➪Microsoft SQL Server➪Enterprise
Manager. With Enterprise Manager open, click the plus icons until you see folder
icons available for your database server name. When you can see the folders,
right-click the Database folder and select New Database, as shown in Figure 2-9.
(Note that if you are using SQL Server 2005, you will be using SQL Server
Management Studio rather than Enterprise Manager. Aside from that, setup for
both SQL Server 2000 and the 2005 version are very similar.)
Clicking the new database opens a new window that allows you to give your
new database a name. It is a good idea to name the database something that
allows you to easily identify it, such as the name of the site. A very important
note here is that you cannot use any periods in the name of the database.
Doing so causes all calls to the database to look for it in the wrong place.
Microsoft SQL Server users 
and access permissions
There are several ways to log in to a Microsoft SQL Server database. The 
way you do it depends on how your Microsoft SQL Server is configured, but
the most common and secure method is to create a new user in Microsoft
SQL Server for each database you want to access. To create a login for your
Figure 2-9:
Microsoft
SQL
Server’s
Enterprise
Manager.
44
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

database, you need to expand the Security folder of your database server
instance within Enterprise Manager. This displays the Login section. Right-
click it and select New Login, as shown in Figure 2-10.
In the SQL Server Login Properties screen that appears when you select New
Login, you need to assign an account name. This is the username to log in to
Microsoft SQL Server for DotNetNuke. Below that section is the Authentication
area, where you are presented with two possibilities: Windows Authentication
and SQL Server Authentication. Sticking with the more common and secure
method, select SQL Server Authentication and assign a password. This pass-
word is also required later on to install DotNetNuke. After assigning the user-
name and password, click the OK button. You see a new window that asks 
you to confirm the password you previously entered. Click OK in that window
as well.
With the new database user created, all that is left is to give that user proper
access and permissions to your DotNetNuke database. To do this, right-click
your database’s Users node in Enterprise Manager. Select New Database User
from the menu that appears. Within the new window that appears, you can
select your previously created login by using the Login Name drop-down list
box. After you select the login, the username is populated and you have to
assign the proper DBO (database owner) permissions by choosing the
db_owner check box in Figure 2-11. Please be aware that DBO permissions
are important because they allow various database calls such as insert and
delete to be executed by the DotNetNuke framework and its modules.
Figure 2-10:

45
Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

After you click the OK button, your Microsoft SQL Server is now ready for
your DotNetNuke installation. Remember that later on in the installation
process, you need the database name, username, and login, along with the
server name.
SQL Server 2005 Express
SQL Server 2005 Express is the free edition of SQL Server we refer to several
times throughout this chapter. This version functions almost identically to its
pricier counterparts, but some options are not available and it also has limi-
tations in terms of database size. In addition to the size limitations, it does
not offer administrative tools such as Enterprise Manager, found in SQL
Server 2000, or its SQL Server 2005 equivalent, Management Studio. You can
get a free add-on tool, however, that is not quite as detailed but still useful.
It’s called SQL Server Management Studio Express and can be found on the
Microsoft Web site (www.microsoft.com) in the download section.
You still need the same information to connect to this database, and the way
DotNetNuke operates by using SQL Server Express as its database server is
identical to the SQL Server 2000 and 2005 editions. One item worth mention-
ing is that when you are using SQL Server Express, you are actually connect-
ing to a database file that resides in the Database folder in your DotNetNuke
install. This file is included in all DotNetNuke 4 distributions.

Preinstallation Configuration
After you have uploaded your DotNetNuke install to the remote Web host, as
described in the “Getting DotNetNuke to Your Server” section, the next item
on the agenda is to configure it so that the automatic installation method
DotNetNuke uses functions correctly. To make sure that the installation goes
as smoothly as possible, you must configure several items properly prior to
calling up the Web site the first time.
The Web.Config file
DotNetNuke is often referred to as a database-driven application framework.
This means that much of what you see when viewing a DotNetNuke Web site is
actually pulled from the database. When it comes down to it, what is actually
stored in the database is content and a series of configuration settings. Besides
the content and configuration items stored in the database, there are addi-
tional configuration items that tell DotNetNuke how to function. These configu-
ration items are settings the DotNetNuke application needs to operate — they
normally need to be set only once and don’t need to be changed again. The file
that contains these important settings is named Web.Config and this file must
reside at the root level of the Web site you want to run.
Adjusting the connection string
One of the most important items stored within the Web.Config file is the 
connection string. The connection string is used so your DotNetNuke Web
site can communicate with your database server. A connection string consists
of the following: database server name, database name, database username,
and password. The values you need to properly configure your connection
string should be provided to you by your hosting company in an e-mail or via
your account management area.
After you have located this information, you are going to need to alter the
Web.Config file for your installation. To do this, use your favorite text editor
program or Notepad. When you open the file by using the text editing pro-
gram, you see code in a structured format, referred to as XML. Locate the
SiteSqlServer area, as shown in the following code:
<appSettings>
<add key=”SiteSqlServer” value=”Server=(local);
Database=DotNetNuke;uid=;pwd=;” />
47
Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

You need to replace the (local) placeholder with the database server name
supplied from the hosting company. Likewise, you need to replace DotNetNuke
with the database name assigned to you by the hosting company. The user-
name needs to be placed after uid= and ends with the semicolon. The same
applies for the password except it follows the pwd=. The end result looks very
similar to the following:
<appSettings>
<add key=”SiteSqlServer” value=”Server=ServerName;
Database=YourDbName;uid=DbUserName;pwd=
DbPassword;” />
After you have finished adjusting the connection string, save the file. At this
time, you can adjust other configuration settings stored in the Web.Config file
if desired. Other settings you may want to change are discussed in Chapter 11.
When you are finished making changes to the Web.Config file and have saved
it, it is time for you to send those changes to the remote Web server. To do
this, FTP the file as described in “Getting DotNetNuke to Your Server” section
earlier in this chapter. One difference here is that if you have already trans-
ferred the Web.Config file to the remote Web server, you may be prompted by
the FTP client to overwrite the original file. If you have yet to complete this
site’s DotNetNuke install process, simply click Yes and allow it to overwrite
the existing file. If you have already installed DotNetNuke for this Web site, or
you are upgrading an existing install, please make sure that you read the next
section.
Getting familiar with the machine key
The machine key is another configuration setting that is stored in the
Web.Config file. If you are installing DotNetNuke for the first time for a partic-
ular Web site, the existence of this configuration item is of little significance.
It isn’t important for a fresh install because it is changed at the time of the
installation by the DotNetNuke application. The machine key encrypts the
passwords for the user accounts that are stored in the database. If the
machine key value is changed after the database is populated, it prohibits
users from logging into your DotNetNuke Web site.
If you have already run your Web site, or you are upgrading an existing Web
site, you need to make sure that you retain the same machine key values that
were generated at the first time of installation and place them in the new
Web.Config file. Normally, it is good practice to make a backup copy of your
Web.Config after you have successfully installed DotNetNuke. This could pre-
vent potential disaster in the future, so it is highly recommended. Now that
you know how important the machine key is, you should probably look at an
example. Machine key is actually two configuration settings located directly
below the SiteSqlServer connection string, outlined in the following code.
The actual value of the keys is different for every install:
48

” />
<add key=”MachineDecryptionKey”
value=”107AA92438A9A4D948CED5D75749429E55EE4EE8
257C4BCE” />
DotNetNuke Automated Installation
So far in this chapter, we have covered the most important items needed to
get your DotNetNuke Web site set up prior to the actual install. After you
have completed all the sections outlined in this chapter, the only thing left to
complete is the actual installation of the Web site. To kick off the automated
installation, which DotNetNuke handles for you, all you have to do is simply
navigate to the URL of your Web site in a Web browser.
Monitoring your installation
When you call up the Web site for the very first time, you should see a screen
similar to Figure 2-12. This screen initially shows only the DotNetNuke logo
and a few lines of text. As the installation progresses, more lines of text are
displayed. Each line explains what is happening at each step of the auto-
mated installation.
Figure 2-12:
DotNet
Nuke’s
automated
Install
screen.
49
Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

If you are upgrading an existing DotNetNuke installation, you see a screen
very similar to Figure 2-12 with a few minor differences pertaining to version
number as well as modules being installed. In an upgrade, the previous instal-
lation’s version number and the version number of the new installation is dis-
played at the top of the screen.
You should carefully review each line that is written to the page to view the
status of that particular step of the installation process. This screen lets you
know if any errors were encountered at time of installation and at which part
those errors occurred. Usually, if you see the installation screen and do not
immediately receive an error, the installation completes. Just because the instal-
lation completed, however, doesn’t mean it was error free. If, by chance, you do
encounter an error and the installation did complete, copy the errors and look
for support using this book or the support forums on www.dotnetnuke.com.
In the shared hosting environment, you can often ask your hosting company for
support as well.
Completing your DotNetNuke installation
After installation has completed, at the bottom of the install page, you see a
link that says Click Here to Access Your Portal. Clicking this link loads your
newly created DotNetNuke site, which is now available to anyone who has
access to the Internet. After you have clicked this link, you see the Web page
shown in Figure 2-13.
If you have reached this point without errors in the install screen, you have
successfully set up your DotNetNuke Web site. The first thing you should do
at this time is to log in by using the default host account and change the
password for the host and the admin user accounts. This is very important: 
If you do not do this, the current username and password combinations 
are shown on the screen and anyone who has access to the Internet can
access your site. This means they can log in to your Web site and change 
Figure 2-13:
A newly
installed
DotNetNuke
Web site.
50
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

the passwords of these accounts, thus making the Web site no longer under
your control. If this situation were to occur, you would probably have to clear
out your database and install DotNetNuke again.
If you never saw the installation screen or you couldn’t successfully complete
your installation, read the “Troubleshooting Your Installation” section later in
this chapter to see if your error is one of the common errors listed.
If you were able to install but you did see an error throughout the automated
installation process, review the support Forums on www.DotNetNuke.com
to see if others have run into the same problem you did.
Installing DotNetNuke 
with Control Panels
This chapter has primarily focused on shared hosting environments that
involve some manual work on your end. The manual work involves things like
editing your connection string, downloading a DotNetNuke installation pack-
age, and finally sending the unzipped contents of that installation package to
your remote Web server. Another form of shared hosting, however, involves
software called control panels.
A control panel is simply software that automates the DotNetNuke installation
even more. Control panel software is normally developed by a third-party
company and then purchased by hosting companies to offer as a service to
their customers.
The control panel software makes it even easier for anyone to install
DotNetNuke, but it does have limitations of its own. These limitations 
vary depending on the control panel software being used to control the
DotNetNuke installation and the Web hosting company’s policies.
Common control panel benefits
One of the huge benefits of using a host that offers a control panel setup is
that it often allows you to avoid errors during the install process. Although
the DotNetNuke install process is rather intuitive, some users with little or 
no experience setting up a Web site sometimes find the installation the most
difficult part of starting with DotNetNuke. When you use a control panel, the
DotNetNuke installation is normally on the server in the correct location and
the control panel sets the connection string at the time of installation.
51
Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

The setups are often very inexpensive, offer plenty of flexibility for very little
money, and come with more than adequate support packages. They often
allow you to not worry about setting up e-mail for your domain, offer Web
e-mail access, and most already have DotNetNuke ready to be installed for
you when you are ready to start working on your site. (That saves you the
trouble of using an FTP client to transfer the files to the Web server.)
Common control panel drawbacks
One of the most common limitations when using a shared hosting environ-
ment that makes use of a control panel is that you are often limited to when
you can upgrade your version of DotNetNuke. Another major limitation is not
having superuser-level access. Not having superuser-level access is normally
not bad unless you intend on upgrading your modules. The lack of superuser-
level access means that if you want to add a new module to your Web site or
you want to upgrade an existing version of a module on your Web site, you
have to contact your hosting provider. Depending on the functionality you
need for your Web site, you should consider this when choosing your hosting
provider and verify which type of shared hosting environment they are using.
If you do not have superuser-level access but your host allows you full access
via FTP, you can upgrade your DotNetNuke modules anytime you want by
uploading the files via an FTP client to the proper install folder. Although this
is very much possible to do, there are other settings within DotNetNuke that
you may have to configure in order to enable the installation of modules from
the install folder. It is worth mentioning that even if you do have superuser-
level access, you may want to use this approach to install large sized mod-
ules. The FTP installation method is a great alternative for installing larger file
size modules if your Internet connection speed is slow.
When choosing a hosting company, one of your decisions should be whether
you want to use one that provides a control panel. If you do, you should care-
fully read the benefits section again and ask questions prior to committing
yourself to a hosting plan. This should help you avoid making a decision now
that you may want to change later.
On the other hand, if, after reading this chapter, you feel confident enough 
to try a hosting company that does not offer a control panel, you should 
still research what type of support they offer. Normally, there is plenty of 
free support available at the DotNetNuke forums, but you may not always 
get responses as quickly as you would with a paid support program.

Troubleshooting Your Installation
An installation can go wrong for many reasons: anything from configuration
settings not being set up properly, files missing, permissions not properly 
set up by the hosting company, and the list goes on. Covering every possible
problem is beyond the scope of this book, but, in this section, we cover some
of the most common installation problems.
Configuration errors
If you receive a configuration error, this is most likely a problem with your
Web.Config file. There are a number of reasons that this may happen. One of 
the more common problems is syntax in the Web.Config. While you were editing
your connection string or some other part of the Web.Config file, you may have
changed something into a format that the ASP.NET framework does not recog-
nize. More than likely, if you only edited the connection string, you probably
deleted something that needs to be there, like ; > / symbols, or you removed
a necessary space, thus making two items that should be separate run together.
Another possibility is you may have added a space inside the connection string
where one shouldn’t be, thus also causing the ASP.NET framework to not recog-
nize one of the values set within the connection string item. 
Figure 2-14 represents a typical ASP.NET error, although the wording may
vary slightly.
Object reference error
If you are seeing an “Object reference not set to an instance of an object”
error and this is the first time you are running the DotNetNuke install for this
Web site, you should double-check to make sure that your Web.Config file is
on the remote Web server and placed within the root level directory of your
Web site. If the Web.Config file is missing, the error that you are most likely to
see is shown in Figure 2-15.
There are other times you may see an object reference error; however, most
of the time, when this error is seen, it’s after the installation has completed.
Please note that in a future version of DotNetNuke, an installation wizard will
be provided as part of the download to ease the installation process. At the
time of this writing, it was not yet completed.
53
Chapter 2: Installing DotNetNuke

Database connection errors
Database connection errors are probably the most common set of errors
seen at the time of installation. The error appears as a “Cannot connect to
database” message. When this happens, you need to review your connection
string. Verify that you have properly filled in the database server name, data-
base name, and database username and database password. If any one of
Figure 2-15:

missing.
Figure 2-14:

54
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

these items is incorrect, you can’t connect to your database server. An exam-
ple of what this error looks like can be seen in Figure 2-16.
This error usually appears on the install page or a very empty white Web
page containing only black text.
Earlier in this chapter, we explained how to set up the connection string,
which is authenticated against Microsoft’s SQL Server 2000 by using the
SiteSqlServer configuration variable. If you are using SQL Server version
2005, the connection string setup is exactly the same. However, if you are
using the SQL Express version for your database server, you won’t alter the
connection string outlined in the “Adjusting the connection string” section
earlier in this chapter. Instead, you’ll alter this one:
<appSettings>
<add name=”SiteSqlServer” connectionString=”Data Source=.\
SQLExpress;Integrated Security=True;User
Instance=True;AttachDBFilename=|DataDirectory|
Database.mdf;” providerName=”System.Data.
SqlClient” />
As we mention throughout the chapter, your options for support are your
hosting company and the forums located on DotNetNuke.com. If you are in
need of support, you should include several things along with your request:
DotNetNuke version and number, the error message displayed, and what you
were trying to do. If your error seems to be specific to a particular module,
you should also include the version number of that module in question.

In This Chapter
 Adapting DNN to your environment
 Setting global preferences for new portals
 Installing modules and assigning them to portals
 Lighting up a new portal (or two, or three)
T
his chapter shows you how to configure the default settings that apply 
to all new portals (Web sites) you create in your DNN installation, how 
to install modules to DNN, and how to control which of your Web sites have
access to those modules. Finally, this chapter demonstrates how to create
one, two, or more Web sites.
In the first section of this chapter, we show you how to configure the default
settings that apply to all new portals (Web sites) you create with this DNN
installation. To make it simple to create new Web sites, DNN lets you set a
number of default settings in advance so that when you do create a new Web
site, you don’t need to redo each setting every time. These settings relate to
things like hosting space allocation, e-mail, design, the type of files that can
be uploaded, and more. These settings can later be changed on an individual
Web site, if, for instance, you want to give one Web site additional hosting
space. See Chapter 4 for more on this or Chapter 10 to discover more about
the Site Log setting.
Also in this chapter, we show you how to install modules. DNN comes with 
a number of available modules that must be installed. In addition, there are
many free and commercial modules out in the DNN community that you may
want to install on your Web site. This chapter shows you how to do these two
different types of module installation, as well as how to control which Web
sites can use which modules.
Last but not least, we cover how to create new portals within this DNN 
installation.

Changing Settings to Adapt 
to Your Needs
The Site Configuration section provides information on your DNN installation
and relates to every portal in this DNN application. Here you can find out the
version number of your DNN application, as well as set DNN to check for 
version upgrades and provide you with a link to download newer versions.
There is also a range of other fields that display the settings on your server.
These will be of interest to you if you are running your own server. Alternatively,
if you are seeking technical or development support, the support staff will need
to know this information to understand your setup.
Here’s how to view the Site Configuration details:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
The Host Settings page enables you to set the default details for all new
Web sites in this DNN installation.
3. Go to the Site Configuration section, as shown in Figure 3-1.
4. Your version number is displayed at DotNetNuke Version.
This is the version of DNN you are using. Typically, three new versions
are released each year. This version number can be displayed in your
Web browser. See “Setting the default appearance for new portals” for
more information.
5. Select Check For Upgrades? to be advised when a later version of DNN
is available.
If you are planning to upgrade to newer versions of DotNetNuke, select
this check box to find out when a new version is available.
6. If a green button is displayed at Upgrade Available?, click to down-
load the latest version.
Clicking on the button goes to the Downloads page of the DNN Web site,
where you can get the latest version.
7. Note the following information regarding your database:
• Data Provider: The name of the provider that is identified in the
Web.Config file is displayed here. SqlDataProvider is the default
setting for DNN; however, other database names such as
OracleDataProvider may be displayed.
• .NET Framework: The version of the .NET Framework that has
been selected in IIS as the application pool for DNN.
58
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

• ASP.NET Identity: The Windows user account under which the
application is running. This is the account that needs to be granted
folder permissions on the server.
• Host Name: Displays the host name of your Web site. The host
name is the name of the server that DNN is running on. If your 
site is running in a Web farm, this value changes depending on
which server in the Web farm is serving you. A Web farm consists
of multiple Web servers serving one Web site and is often used by
hosting companies for large Web sites with lots of traffic.
Setting the host details
In this section, we show you how to set the general contact details of the host
portal. These details are used in any e-mail notifications sent to Administrators
of child portals, as well as e-mail setting tests. These settings refer to the
parent portal. See Chapter 9 for a list of available notification e-mails.
Here’s how to set the host details:
1. Log in as the host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
This displays the Host Settings page, which enables you to set the
default details for all Web sites in this DNN installation.
3. Go to the Host Details section, as shown in Figure 3-2.
This displays details of the parent or host portal.
4. Select the parent or host Web site for this installation from the Host
Portal drop-down box.
The parent or host portal is typically the portal of the host. You can change
the parent Web site for this installation at any time. Wherever there are ref-
erences to parent and child Web sites (often called host and site), the one
Figure 3-1:
The Site
Configura-
tion section

to the host.
59
Chapter 3: Set It and Forget It: Default Portal Settings

selected here is the host. For example, if an invalid URL to one of the 
portals in this DNN installation is requested, this portal is shown.
5. Enter a title for the parent Web site into the Host Title text box.
This is the name of the parent Web site. This value is shown in the
[HOSTNAME] skin object in the skin.
6. Enter the URL of the parent Web site into the Host URL text box; for
example, www.dnnangel.com.
This URL is the link on the [HOSTNAME] skin object you set above.
7. Enter the contact e-mail address for the parent Web site into the Host
e-mail text box; for example, host@dnnangel.com.
This is the e-mail address of the host Web site and is used in e-mails sent to
and from the host. See Chapter 9 for a list of available notification e-mails.
8. Click the Update link to save these settings.
These setting are now saved and can be edited at any time in the future
if required.
Setting the SMTP server settings
This section enables you to set the SMTP server settings for all Web sites
within this DNN installation. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,
which refers to the mail settings of the server you are using. You need to set
all these fields to be able to send and receive e-mails from all Web sites within
this installation. Anytime an e-mail is sent, it is sent out through the SMTP
server that you specify. Some hosting companies allow you to use localhost
as the entry, and, if you are running DNN on your local machine, you will use
localhost. Most hosting companies give you a dedicated SMTP server to send
your e-mail through.

You should take care not to send large volumes of e-mail through your DNN
Web site: There are harsh penalties for spam, and many hosts will ban your
IP address, which means that none of your notification e-mails will work. If
you need to send thousands of e-mails, you should find an e-mail sending
company to do it for you as they have the right equipment and know the
rules on spam.
A new security role called Subscribers was added to DNN recently. Users
have the ability to unsubscribe themselves from the Subscribers role and
thereby opt out of newsletters sent from the site. This was required under
the new anti-spam laws. When you send mass e-mails (also known as news-
letters), use this role rather than the Registered Users role. See Chapter 7 for
more information on sending Newsletters.
Here’s how to set the SMTP settings for all Web sites:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
This displays the Host Settings page, which enables you to set the
default details for all Web sites in this DNN installation.
3. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings and then click
the Maximize button next to SMTP Server Settings.
This displays SMTP server settings, shown in Figure 3-3, which must be
set to enable Web sites to send e-mails. There is also a Test button here
to test these settings.
4. Enter the address of the SMTP server into the SMTP Server text box.
The SMTP server name is the URL of the server that all e-mail will be
sent from. This usually takes the form of mail.domain.com and is
sometimes an IP address like 213.164.164.43. If you are running on your
local machine, the address will be localhost.
5. Select the type of SMTP authentication.
This section has three radio buttons for the three types of authentica-
tion for your SMTP server that DNN supports:
• Anonymous authentication is used when the SMTP server does 
not need to validate which user account is trying to send an e-mail
through it. A lot of hosting companies use this system because they
have supplied you with a SMTP server URL that can only be discov-
ered inside their network; therefore, to send an e-mail, you must
already be on their network, so there is no need to authenticate you.
• Basic authentication is simple username and password authentica-
tion. When your DNN site tries to send an e-mail, it will pass the user-
name and password to the SMTP server, which will then attempt to
authenticate the request. If the username and password are correct,
the e-mail will be sent; if not, you will get an error message.
61
Chapter 3: Set It and Forget It: Default Portal Settings

• NTLM authentication uses Windows Authentication to validate the
account trying to send an e-mail. This is most often used when the
mail server is Microsoft Exchange.
6. Check the SMTP Enable SSL check box if your Web site requires a
secure connection.
This option is selected when your e-mail provider requires a secure con-
nection to the SMTP server. Some e-mail servers require a secure SSL
connection when sending e-mails to try to cut down on unauthorized use
of their SMTP gateway. This is not usually required for most Web sites.
7. Enter the username of your SMTP server into the SMTP Username 
text box.
Your hosting provider supplies the username to you.
8. Enter the password of your SMTP server into the SMTP Password 
text box.
Your hosting provider supplies the password to you.
9. Click the Update link to save these settings.
These setting are now saved and you can test them.
10. Click the Test link beside the SMTP Server field to test your settings.
A “Message Sent Successfully” message is displayed if the test mail was
successfully sent. If it failed to send, an error message that provides
information on why the message failed is displayed.
In a lot of hosting situations, the Web server your Web site runs on is also the
SMTP server. This can cause your e-mail to be flagged as spam by the receiv-
ing mail servers. Mail services such as Hotmail, Google, and Yahoo! get a lot
of spam, so they have strict limits on how many e-mails are sent to them.
Figure 3-3:
The SMTP
Server
Settings
section
enables the
Host to set
the e-mail
server
settings for
this DNN
installation.
62
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

One way to help make sure that your e-mail is not flagged as spam is to
ensure that the SMTP Server address you enter at SMTP Server above is the
same server name that is specified in the MX record of your domain. An MX
record (Mail exchanger record) is a type of resource record in the domain
name system (DNS) that sets how Internet e-mail is sent. MX records point to
the servers that should receive an e-mail and their priority over each other.
Ask your hosting provider about this if you have trouble sending e-mail.
In most cases, you don’t need to specify the proxy server settings for DNN.
However, some modules may need to use ports that may require a proxy
server to function properly. Modules that use things like File Transfer
Protocol (FTP), Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), or Really Simple
Syndication (RSS) may need this setting. Talk to your hosting provider about
this if you have trouble with these sorts of modules.
Enabling Friendly URLs
Enabling Friendly URLs automatically changes the format of the Web site URL
address to one that is easier for users to remember and type in, as shown in
Figure 3-4. See Chapter 11 for more details on why you may choose to use
Friendly URLs.
Here’s how to enable Friendly URLs:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
This displays the Host Settings page, which enables you to set the
default details for all Web sites in this DNN installation.
3. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings and then click
the Maximize button beside Friendly URL Settings.
This displays the Enable/Disable check box for this setting. If this box is
checked, a list of editable items is displayed below.
4. Check the check box beside Use Friendly URLs? to enable Friendly URLs.
A list of editable items is displayed. This list is a list of rules that are
used to transform the standard DNN URLs into friendly human-readable
and search engine–friendly URLs. These are called regular expression
rules and are beyond the scope of this book. However, if you want to find
out more about regular expressions, visit www.regexlib.com to see a
large library of regular expressions.

Chapter 3: Set It and Forget It: Default Portal Settings

Setting auto-unlock of accounts
DNN includes a security setting aimed at preventing people from trying to log
in to someone else’s accounts. If someone unsuccessfully attempts to log in
to a user’s account five times, DNN can be set to block that user account from
attempting further logins to the Web site for a set number of minutes. When a
lockout occurs, the host receives a notification message telling them about
this suspicious activity.
Here’s how to set the auto-unlock accounts time period for all portals:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
This displays the Host Settings page, which enables you to set the
default details for all Web sites in this DNN installation.
3. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings and then click
the Maximize button beside Other Settings.
This displays a number of miscellaneous settings for all Web sites. Many
have defaults set already.
4. Enter the number of minutes until auto-unlock of an account occurs in
the Auto-Unlock Accounts After (Minutes) text box; for example, 20.
Alternatively, you can set this field to zero (0) to disable the auto-
unlock feature. If it is disabled, only the Administrator can unlock the
user account.
5. Click the Update link.

Installing Modules and Assigning 
Them to Portals
DNN comes with two installed modules (Links and Text/HTML) and a large
number of available modules that you can choose to install. Furthermore,
DNN has a large community of module developers who provide yet more
additional modules. This section shows you how to install both available 
and new modules.
This section also shows you how to set certain modules as Premium mod-
ules. If a module is set as premium, the host can choose which portals have
access to use these modules. This offers a business model for hosts or host-
ing companies to sell access to premium modules.
Installing the modules included 
with your DNN application
Here’s how to install the modules that are included with your DNN application:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to Host➪Module Definitions.
This goes to the Module Definitions page, which displays a list of the
installed modules and the available modules.
3. Go to the Available Modules section.
This displays a list of the modules included with this DNN application
but are not yet installed.
4. Select the check box beside each module to be installed.
5. Click the Install Selected Modules link.
The selected modules are now listed in the Installed Modules section on
this page and are also listed in the Module Management section of the
Control Panel.
Installing new modules
To install a new module, you need a zipped file containing all the module
files. This zipped file is often referred to as the PA (private assembly) file.
When you purchase a module, you purchase the PA file, which contains the
compiled code for the module. Some companies also sell the source code of
their modules, which contain all the code used to build and modify the
65
Chapter 3: Set It and Forget It: Default Portal Settings

module. Check the installation files provided with the module to find out
which zipped file is the PA and therefore the right one to install.
Here’s how to install new modules:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to Host➪Module Definitions.
This displays a list of the modules included with this DNN application
but are not yet installed.
3. Select Install New Module from the module menu.
This goes to the File Upload module specifically for installing modules.
4. Click the Browse button and select the PA of the module to be installed.
5. Click the Save File link.
This displays a report on the installation. Look out for text in red, which
indicates something has failed during installation. If an error is dis-
played, it is a good idea to highlight and copy the whole message and
send it to the module provider for help.
6. Click the Return link.
This will return you to the Module Definitions page. The module will now
be listed in the Installed Modules section.
Setting premium modules and 
assigning them to portals
Here’s how to set premium modules and assign them to individual portals:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to Host➪Module Definitions.
This displays a list of the modules included with this DNN application
but are not yet installed.
3. Go to the Installed Modules section.
This section lists all the modules currently installed in this DNN 
application.
4. Click the Edit button beside the module to be set as premium.
This goes to the Edit Module Definitions page.
5. Check the Premium? check box.
This displays two list boxes. The Available list displays the names of 
the portals in this DNN installation that this module can now be made
66
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

available to, but that do not have access to this module. The Assigned
list displays the names of any portals this module is assigned to.
6. Perform one of the following to assign this module to one or more
portals:
You must have more than one portal in this list to perform assignment
and unassignment:
• Assign the module to a portal: Click on the name of the portal in
the Available list and then click the > link. This adds the portal to
the Assigned list.
• Unassign the module from a portal: Click on the name of the
portal in the Assigned list and then click the < link. This adds the
portal to the Available list.
• Assign the module to all portals: Click the >> link. This adds all
existing portals to the Assigned list. Portals added in the future will
need to be assigned.
• Unassign the module from all portals: Click the << link. This lists
all existing portals in the Available list.
7. Click the Update link.
This returns to the Module Definitions page.
Setting Global Preferences 
for New Portals
This section shows you how to configure the default settings that apply to all
new portals you create within this DNN installation. To save you time, DNN
lets you set a number of default settings that will be applied to each new Web
site you add. These settings relate to hosting space allocation, e-mail, design,
the type of files that can be uploaded, and more. These settings can later be
changed on an individual Web site if, for instance, you want to give one Web
site additional hosting space. See Chapter 4 for more information.
Setting the default appearance 
for new portals
DNN enables you to set a default skin for all new portals. This feature is par-
ticularly useful in franchising arrangements where the host needs to control
how the child sites look and feel to their users. Here is how to set up the
default skin and container to be used on new Web sites you create:
67
Chapter 3: Set It and Forget It: Default Portal Settings

1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to Host➪Host Settings.
This displays the Host Settings page, which enables you to set the
default details for all Web sites in this DNN installation.
3. Go to the Appearance section.
This displays the default design options set for new portals created.
4. Check the Show Copyright Credits? check box to display the DNN
copyright message in the address bar of your Web browser.
Check to displays the DNN version number in the Web browser title bar
after the page title details, as shown in Figure 3-5; for example, (DNN4.4.1).
5. Select the Use Custom Error Message? check box to enable DNN
custom error messages.
When this is checked, DNN intercepts any errors that occur in the appli-
cation and modules and displays friendly basic error messages to your
users. If you are logged in as an Admin or host, more information is 
displayed to help you diagnose the problem. All error messages are
recorded in the Log Viewer for your review. See Chapter 10 to find out
more about the Log Viewer.
6. Select either Host or Site in the Host Skin field to access the skins
uploaded to that area.
Selecting Host displays all skins managed on the Host➪Skins page; like-
wise, selecting Site displays all skins managed on the Admin➪Skins. Host
skins are available to all Web sites within the application, whereas Site
skins are only available for use on the current Web site. The Host Skin
field sets the default skin to be used on all new Web site pages apart
from the Admin Skin pages, which you will set in Step 7.
7. Select the name of skin in the Host Skin drop-down list.
This sets the default skin to be used on all pages of new Web sites 
created in this DNN installation.
8. Click the Preview link to preview the skin.
This opens a new Web browser with an example of the skin.
9. Repeat Steps 6-8 for the Host Container, Admin Skin, and Admin
Container fields to change these settings.
The Host Container field sets the default container to be used on mod-
ules added. The Admin Skin and Admin Container fields set the default
skin and container to be used on administration and edit pages of new
Web sites.
10. Click the Update link.
The default design for new Web sites is now set. To find how to update
the design on a single Web site that has been created, see Chapter 4.

Setting the hosting space for new Web sites
When you set up your hosting arrangement with your supplier, you were 
allocated a certain amount of disk space, probably on the order of 100MB 
or more. This means you can upload files, photos, and so on until you reach
that limit. If you are planning to create child portals on your DNN installation,
you will need to limit the size of each one so that you don’t exceed your limi-
tation. To do this, you set the hosting space of each child portal. As part of
the upload process, DNN checks to see that there is sufficient space remain-
ing from the allocated amount for the site before it allows the upload.
If you upload files to your server by using FTP, you will bypass DNN’s space
allocation checking. To synchronize your Web site with the server, make sure
that you run the Synchronize function on the File Manager to synchronize
DNN with the File System. See Chapter 4 for more.
Here’s how to specify how many megabytes (MB) of hosting space is allocated
to each new Web site:
1. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
2. Click the Maximize button beside Payment Settings.
This displays a number of settings that control hosting capacity by 
hosting space, page quota, or user quota.
3. Select one of these options to limit hosting space:
• Hosting Space (MB): Enter the hosting space allocated to all new
Web sites. For example, entering 10 allocates 10 megabytes to each

Enabling the Site Log
The Site Log provides access to useful activity reports for each Web site, 
such as Page Popularity and Page Views. This information can be used by the
Administrator to discover more about their users and page activity. See Chapter
10 for more details on how to change these settings for individuals Web sites.
Here’s how to set the default Site Log for all portals:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
This displays the Host Settings page, which enables you to set the
default details for all Web sites in this DNN installation.
3. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings and then click
the Maximize button beside Other Settings.
This displays a number of miscellaneous settings for all Web sites. Many
have defaults set already.
4. Enter the number of day’s history that will be stored for the site log in
the Site Log History; for example, 60.
5. Click the Update link.
Setting the types of files 
that can be uploaded
One of the most commonly used features of DNN is the ability to upload files
such as photos, documents, and images to the Web site. This feature can be
made available to your users by appropriate use of the security features of
DNN. (See Chapter 4 for more on security roles.) The downside is that users
uploading files to your server can create a security issue by uploading mali-
cious files like viruses that could damage your server. To prevent this, DNN
has a built-in list of acceptable file types that can be uploaded. When any file
is uploaded, it is checked against this list: If the file extension is on the list, it
can be uploaded. Otherwise, a message stating that the file type is not
accepted is displayed.
Here’s how to set the types of files that can be uploaded to the Host and Site
File Managers:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
This displays the Host Settings page, which enables you to set the
default details for all Web sites in this DNN installation.

Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

3. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings and then click
the Maximize button beside Other Settings.
This displays the File Upload Extensions text box, shown in Figure 3-6,
where a list of the permitted file upload extensions is maintained.
4. Review the current file types and enter any additional file types sepa-
rated by a comma; for example, MP3,DOC allows users to upload MP3
files and Microsoft Word documents.
You may need to check with your hosting provider about what files 
they allow.
5. Click the Update link.
We suggest that you not let users upload executable files (EXE) as they can
harbor viruses or other malicious code.
Choosing who has permission 
to upload new skins
You have the ability to control who can upload skins to the DNN installation.
If you are setting up the child portals to give administrators of those sites
total control over the look and feel of those sites, you should allow the portal
to have upload permissions for skins. However, if you want to restrict the
look and feel of the child sites (for example, if the sites are part of a franchise
group and you only want the child sites to have a limited list of skins), give
the host upload permissions. This option means that only you can upload
skins for the child sites to use.
Here’s how to set DNN to enable or restrict Administrators from uploading
skin packages:
1. Log in as the host.
Figure 3-6:

Chapter 3: Set It and Forget It: Default Portal Settings

2. Navigate to the Host➪Host Settings page.
This displays the Host Settings page, which enables you to set the
default details for all Web sites in this DNN installation.
3. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings and then click
the Maximize button beside Other Settings.
4. Select either Host or Portal for the Skin Upload Permission field.
Selecting Host restricts the ability to upload new skins to the host.
Selecting Portal enables the Administrators of each Web site to also 
be able to upload new skins and containers to their Web sites.
5. Click the Update link.
If you selected Portal, Administrators now have the ability to upload skins
to their Web sites via the Admin➪Skins pages of any child Web sites.
Lighting Up a New Portal 
(Or Two, or Three)
Each DNN installation can contain multiple portals and this section shows you
how to add more portals to your DNN installation. Each new portal has its own
unique security roles, user accounts, vendor banners, pages, and content.
New portals can be created with just one page that can be added to, or by
selecting a template for the portal. A template consists of one or more Web
pages with or without existing content. DNN comes with at least one sample
template and you can create your own by copying one of your existing portals.
Creating new portals
Add new portals to your DNN installation. There are two types of portals you
can add called parent and child portals. Parent portals have their own domain
name, whereas child portals are a subdomain of the domain of your DNN instal-
lation. These portals inherit the defaults set in the Host Settings sections.
These settings can later be modified: See Chapter 4 for more information.
Don’t get the naming of parent and child portals in this tutorial confused 
with the parent (Host) and child (Site) relationship discussed elsewhere. The
parent and child portals referred to in this tutorial only relate to the way the
URL is made.
Here’s how to create a new portal:
72
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Portals page.
This displays a list of the portals in this DNN installation.
3. Select Add New Portal from the Portals module menu.
This opens the Signup module, shown in Figure 3-7, where new portals
are created.
4. Select either the Parent or Child radio button beside the Portal Type
field to select the domain type.
Select Parent if you have a domain name for this portal; for example,
www.domain.com. Select Child if this portal will be a child of this
domain; for example, www.domain.com/childportal1. Selecting Child
displays the domain of your Web site in the Portal Alias field. Use this
option when the portal will not have a separate domain name, or when
you are waiting for one. This is also a good temporary measure so you
can get a portal online straightaway while waiting for a domain to be set
up. It takes about two or three days for new domains to resolve properly.
5. Enter an alias for the Web site into the Portal Alias text box.
This information sets the main URL for this Web site. After the site has
been created, you can add as many other aliases as you like. Many sites
have multiple domains pointing to the same site. For example, you may
have domains such as www.dotnetnuke.com and www.dotnetnuke.
net, both pointing to the same portal.
6. Optional. Click the Customize link beside Home Directory to edit this
setting.
When you create a new portal, you also create a new folder on the Web
server to store all the files associated with that site. By default, the
Home Directory will be Portals/[PortalID], where PortalID is a number
generated by DNN depending on how many portals there are. If you want
to give the new portal a folder that is more descriptive, or if you want 
to store the file in a different folder structure, you can enter your own
folder path in the text box. If you enter Portals/MyNewSite, all the files
for the new portal go into that folder. You can also create other paths
like ChildSites/MyNewSite that create a new folder under the root direc-
tory on your server.
You cannot create folders outside of the root directory of your main site.
7. Enter a title for the Web site into the Title text box.
This is the name of the Web site, such as DNNAngel. This field can be
modified later if required.
8. Enter a description of the Web site into the Description text box.
This is the description of the Web site, which is what is shown in search
engine results. This field can be modified or completed later.
73
Chapter 3: Set It and Forget It: Default Portal Settings

9. Enter keywords for the Web site into the Keywords text box.
Keywords assist your search engine rankings and can be added or 
modified later.
10. Select a template name from the Template drop-down box to set the
template for this new Web site.
A template sets the initial pages and content for the new Web site. This
setting displays a description of the selected template below this field. To
find out which template best suits your purpose, select each one to read
a description of each. For more details on templates, see “Photocopying
your portal” later in this chapter.
11. Complete the Security Settings fields to set up the Administrator
account for the new portal.
The Administrator has full rights to build and modify the new Web site
and edit all of its settings. The details entered in the Security Settings
will be e-mailed to the e-mail address entered here so that the
Administrator has a copy of her login details.
12. Click the Create Portal link to create the new portal.
The new portal has now been created and you are now taken to the
home page of the new portal. You are still logged in as the host for all
Web sites. If you return to the Host➪Portals page, you will see that the
new Web site is listed in the Portals module.
There is no host password for this new portal, only the host portal.
Photocopying your portal
Imagine you have built a portal for your local church. The church community
is growing and now has three regional branches. The portal you built is cen-
tral to the growth of the church and so you want to provide each branch with
a template of your portal to get them started. Typically, this would be quite a
challenge, but not with DNN! Using DNN, you can create a copy of a portal
called a template, which can then be used again and again. The template
includes each of the pages and modules within your portal. The pages and
modules are named the same as the original portal. Module content can be
optionally included. Templates use the same skin and containers as the origi-
nal portal. By changing a few contact details, each branch will have a ready-
to-go Web site in just a few clicks.
74
Part I: Drawing from the DotNetNuke Power Source 

Here’s how to export a template of a Web site, with or without module content:
1. Log in as the Host.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Portals page.
This displays a list of the existing portals in this DNN installation.
3. Select Export Portal Template from the module menu.
4. Select the portal you want to template from the Portal drop-down box,
as shown in Figure 3-8.
5. Enter a name for the new template into the Template File Name text
box; for example, Real Estate Franchise.
6. Enter a description of the new template into the Template Description
text box; for example, Franchisees Web site: Home, For Sellers, For
Buyers, Client Center, and Contact Us pages.
This information helps you identify the template in the future.
7. Choose whether to include module content by checking or not check-
ing the Include Content check box.
Checking this option exports all the modules, including content. If this
option is not checked, the template exports all the modules without 
content. The titles and other modules settings are still exported.

T
his chapter explains how to configure basic Web site settings such as the
name of your Web site, a description of its purpose, and key words for
search engines. If you have host access, this chapter also explains how to set
the disk space and billing period for an individual Web site.
Also in this chapter, we explain how to register and manage users, how to
add and manage Web pages, how to begin adding content to your Web site,
and how to add and manage Web site files such as documents, images, and
movies. Finally, we wrap up this chapter by demonstrating how to change the
design used on your Web site.
Setting Defaults for a Web Site
In Chapter 3, we cover various host settings that set the defaults for all new
Web sites created by using this DNN installation. In this chapter, we cover
many of the same settings; however, these are site settings rather than host
settings. Site settings affect only a particular Web site and do not affect the
default settings of any new Web sites you create.

Setting Site Details
The Site Details section enables you to enter a title and description of the
Web site and key words that describe its purpose. Search engines use this
information to index your Web site on the World Wide Web.
Here’s how to set the basic site details:
1. Click the Site button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Admin➪Site Settings page, where you can set details
specific to this Web site.
2. Go to the Basic Settings, Site Details section, as shown in Figure 4-1.
3. Enter a title for the Web site into the Title text box.
This is the main title for your Web site, such as your business name.
This title appears in the title bar of your Web site browser, which is
located in the top-left corner.
4. Enter a description of the Web site into the Description text box.
Write a brief description of the purpose of your Web site.
5. Enter keywords for the Web site into the Key Words text box.
Enter keywords and phrases that describe the purpose of your Web site.
6. Click the Update link.
This saves these settings.
Increase the effectiveness of your keywords by using them frequently within
the content of your Web site. This confirms for search engines that these
really are the keywords for your Web site and not just some words you typed
in to get more traffic.

Setting Payment Details
In a later section of this chapter, “Getting Your Users into Roles,” we cover
how to create subscription roles. Subscription roles enable you to designate
areas of your Web site that users must pay a fee to access. Setting a fee for
Subscription roles is optional. If you do choose to charge a fee, use the
Payment Details to set the payment gateway or payment provider you will
use to collect the funds for you. DNN is integrated with a handful of different
companies, so you should investigate them to see which suits you best. A full
list of these companies is displayed in the drop-down list box of the Payment
Processor field. After you have chosen your payment provider and signed up
for an account with them, you can complete this section.
1. Click the Site button located in the Common Tasks section of the

Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

Getting Your Users into Roles
In Chapter 1, we discuss the basic concepts of membership and security
roles. In this chapter, we delve further into how to set up the roles for your
Web site and how to add users (members) to these roles.
Every DNN Web site comes with a couple of built-in roles. These are
Administrator, Registered Users, and Subscribers. Every user you add to your
Web site is automatically added to the Registered Users role. You can create
as many other roles as you need to control who can access the different
areas of your Web site.
Adding a new role
Here’s how to add a new role to this Web site that you control access to:
1. Click the Roles button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Admin➪Security Roles page and lists the existing roles
on this Web site, as shown in Figure 4-4.
2. Select Add New Role from the module menu.
This goes to the Edit Security Roles page, where you can create a new
role for this Web site.
3. Enter a name for the role into the Role Name text box.
For example, Client File Access.
Figure 4-3:
These host

85
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

4. Enter a description of the role into the Description text box.
For example, Members of this role are clients who are able to down-
load files from this Web site.
5. If the role belongs to a role group, select the group name from the
Role Group drop-down box. If the role isn’t part of a role group, leave
this setting on <Global Roles>.
Find out more about how and why to create role groups in the next sec-
tion, “Adding a new role group.”
6. Click the Update link.
This returns you to the Security Roles page where the new role is now
listed. If you added a role that belongs to a role group, you need to
select the group name from the drop-down box above or select <All
Roles>.
Adding a new role group
Because your Web site can include as many roles as you like, you can end up
with 20, 30, or even 100 different roles. To make it easier to manage your
roles, group similar roles together by creating a role group. For example, you
might have a role group called Staff and create a number of roles within this
group such as Marketing, Telemarketing, Sales, and so on. Roles that don’t
belong to a role group are called global roles.
Here’s how to create a role group:
1. Click the Roles button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Admin➪Security Roles page, which lists existing roles
on this Web site.
Figure 4-4:
The

86
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

2. Select Add New Role Group from the module menu.
This goes to the Edit Role Group page, where you can create a new role
for this Web site.
3. Enter a name for the role group into the Group Name text box.
For example, Staff.
4. Enter a description of the role group into the Description text box.
For example, Staff members only.
5. Click the Update link.
You can now add one or more roles to this group.
Creating an opt-in/opt-out role
Creating opt-in/opt-out roles enables users to control the information they
can access on your Web site. For example, you may create an opt-in role
called “Jokes and Riddles” that enables members to view a page that has
funny stuff on it. Users can choose whether to see this page or not by opting
in and out of this role.
Another way to use this type of role is to enable users to subscribe and
unsubscribe from newsletters. (See Chapter 9 to find out how to send
newsletters.)
Here’s how to create a role that users can opt in and opt out of at any time:
1. Click the Roles button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Admin➪Security Roles page, which lists existing roles
on this Web site.
2. Select Add New Role from the module menu.
This goes to the Edit Security Role page, shown in Figure 4-5, where you
can create a new role for this Web site.
3. Enter a name for the role into the Role Name text box.
For example, News and Gossip.
4. Enter a description of the role into the Description text box.
For example: Find out the latest celebrity gossip by subscribing to our
monthly newsletter.
87
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

5. If the role belongs to a role group, select the group name from the
Role Group drop-down box. If the role isn’t part of a role group, leave
this setting on <Global Roles>.
6. Check the Public Role? check box.
This makes access to opt in and opt out of this role public to all users on
their own profile page.
7. Check the Auto Assignment check box if you want new users to be
automatically added to this role.
This sets the role to automatically add all new users to it. If this option is
not checked, users must subscribe to the role on their profile page.
8. Click the Update link.
This returns you to the Security Roles page where the new role is now
listed. If you added a role that belongs to a Role Group, you need to select
the group name from the drop-down box above or select <All Roles>.
Setting user registration
Registration on your Web site can be made available to anyone who visits the
Web site, or it can be managed exclusively by the Administrator. When a user
registers, they receive an e-mail containing all of their account and login details.
Here’s how to set up user registration for the Web site:
1. Click the Site button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
2. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings.

3. Go to the Security Settings section.
This displays the User Registration options.
4. Select the required user registration from the options listed at the
User Registration field.
• None: Only the Administrator is able to register new users.
• Private: Visitors can complete a registration form to express their
interest in becoming a member of the Web site; however, they can’t
log in to the Web site until the Administrator gives them access by
authorizing their account. The Administrator receives an e-mail
notification when this type of registration occurs.
• Public: All visitors can register and are given immediate access to
areas of the Web site, including areas restricted to registered user
access only.
• Verified: All visitors can register, but can’t log in to the Web site
until they enter a verification code that is e-mailed to them. This
verifies that they have provided a valid e-mail address.
5. Click the Update link.
The registration type is now set. If None has been selected, the Register
link is no longer displayed in the top-right corner of the Web site. This
link is displayed for all other registration options.
Adding a new user
The Administrator can add new users to the Web site at any time. Here’s how:
1. Click the Users button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Admin➪User Accounts page.
2. Select Add New User from the module menu.
This displays the Edit User Accounts page, shown in Figure 4-6, where
you can add the new user to this Web site.
3. Enter a username for this user into the User Name text box.
Users need to enter a username and a password when they log in to the
Web site. Usernames are unique and they cannot be changed.
4. Enter the person’s first name into the First Name text box.
5. Enter the person’s last name into the Last Name text box.
89
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

6. Enter the name that will be displayed to others into the Display Name
text box.

7. Enter the person’s e-mail address into the E-mail Address text box.
8. In the Password section, select Random Password to automatically
generate a password for this person.
This lets you generate a random password for this person, relieving you
from thinking up a new password each time. The person can change the
password later. If you prefer to create a password, you can do so by
entering it into both of the password text fields in Figure 4-6. Note: The
password must be at least seven characters in length.
9. Click the Register link.
The user account has now been created and you are returned to the
User Accounts page. To view the new user account, click on the All link,
which will display all the user accounts, or click on the letter that is the
first letter of their first name.
Adding and Managing Pages 
on Your Web Site
This section explains how to add and set pages on your Web site. If you need
a refresher on the basic concepts of pages and how they apply to DNN, flip
back to Chapter 1.

Adding a page
Here’s how to add a new page to the Web site:
1. Click the Add button located in the Page Functions section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Page Management page, shown in Figure 4-7, where
you set the information of the new page.
2. Enter the name of the page as it will be displayed in the Web site
menu into the Page Name box.
If you want to add your page quickly, you can skip Steps 3-6, which
assist search engines in ranking your Web site.
3. Enter a descriptive title for the page in the Page Title text box.
This title will be displayed in the very top-left corner of the Web site
browser and is used by search engines to list your Web site. If you don’t
enter a title, the page name will be displayed. Your title should describe
the information people can find on the page. The title should be between
60–90 characters.
4. Enter a description for the page in the Description text box.
Search engines will use this description to index and describe the page.
The description should be between 170–200 characters.
5. Enter keywords and phrases for the page in the Key Words text box.
These are words and phrases that describe the page content. Separate
each word or phrase with a comma. Try to anticipate the words or
phrases someone would enter into a search engine to find your content.
Your search engine ranking should use words and phrases that are
included in the content of this page.
6. At the Parent Page drop-down box, select a page to position this page
beneath or leave this field as <None Selected> if the page doesn’t
belong under another one.
DNN uses the terms parent and child to explain the relationship between
pages on the Web site. A parent page is displayed in the menu and can
have one or more child pages belonging to it. Positioning your mouse
over a parent page displays its child pages. This grouping of pages
makes it easy for people to find their way around the Web site.
7. Select <All Roles> at the Filter by Group box beside Permissions to
view a full list of all roles.
This option is visible only if one or more role groups have been added to
the Web site as shown in “Adding a new role group” earlier in this chap-
ter. If this option isn’t displayed, skip to Step 8.
91
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

Alternatively, you can filter groups by selecting a role group name, or
selecting global roles, which are roles that don’t belong to a group.
8. Select the check box beside any role in the View Page column of the
Permissions field to enable that role to view the page.
To make the page viewable by everyone, select All Users. If the page is
not viewable by All Users, only logged-in members of roles selected here
can view the page. Role members can also view any modules added to
this page unless the modules have different permissions set. Only
Administrators are selected to view the page by default at this setting.
This can be useful when building your Web site live on the Internet, as
you can add content to the page before you set it as viewable by All
Users. 
9. Select the check box beside any role in the Edit Page column of the
Permissions field to enable that role to edit the page.
If only Administrators can edit the page, you can leave these settings as
they are. Providing role members permission to edit a page gives them
the ability to change the whole page. These users are sometimes called
Page Editors because they have permission to edit an entire page,
although this isn’t an actual security role. Members of selected roles will
have the Control Panel displayed on this page, providing them with the
ability to add and edit pages below this page and add and edit modules
on this page. (In this scenario, the Common Tasks section of the Control
Panel, which provides access to site settings, user accounts, security
roles, and the file manager, will be disabled. The Help button in the
Common Tasks section will still be enabled.) Page Editors can delete the
page and edit most of the page settings; however, they cannot move the
page. They can add and copy new child pages below this page and add
content to those pages. They can add new modules to the original page
and, by default, they can edit all module content on that page.
10. Click the Update link.
The page name is now displayed in the menu unless it was set with a
parent page; in that case, you will need to mouse over the parent page
and click on the page name to view it.

Setting view and edit permissions 
for a page
Here’s how to set the view and edit permissions on a page:
1. Click the Settings button located in the Page Functions section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Page Management page, where you can set and edit
the page.
2. Select <All Roles> at the Filter by Group box beside Permissions to
view a full list of all roles.
This option will only be visible if one or more role groups have been
added to the Web site, as shown in “Adding a new role group” earlier in
this chapter. If this option isn’t displayed, skip to Step 3.

3. Select and deselect the check boxes beside each role in the View Page
column of the Permissions field to set which roles can view the page.
To make the page viewable by everyone, select All Users. If the page is
not viewable by All Users, only logged-in members of roles selected here
can view the page. Role members can also view any modules added to
this page unless the modules have different permissions set. Only
Administrators are selected to view the page by default at this setting.
This can be useful when building your Web site live on the Internet, as
you can add content to the page before you set it as viewable by All
Users.
4. Select and deselect the check boxes beside each role in the Edit Page
column to set which roles can edit the page.
If only Administrators can edit the page, you can leave these settings as
they are. Providing role members with permission to edit a page gives
them the ability to change the whole page. These users are sometimes
called Page Editors because they have permission to edit an entire page,
although this isn’t an actual security role. Members of selected roles will
have the Control Panel displayed on this page, providing them with the
ability to add and edit pages below this page and add and edit modules
on this page. (In this scenario, the Common Tasks section of the Control
Panel, which provides access to site settings, user accounts, security
roles, and the file manager, will be disabled. The Help button in the
Common Tasks section will still be enabled.) Page Editors can delete the
page and edit most of the page settings; however, they cannot move the
page. They can add and copy new child pages below this page and add
content to those pages. They can add new modules to the original page
and by default they can edit all module content on that page.
5. Click the Update link.
The page name is now displayed in the menu, unless it was set with a
parent page; in that case, you will need to mouse over the parent page
and click on the page name to view it.
Copying view and edit permissions 
to child pages
DNN enables you to bulk update the view and edit permissions of the child
pages of a single parent page to match their parent page. Keep this feature in
mind when deciding how to organize your Web site. Keeping the permissions
to view and edit pages organized by parent page makes the Web site both
easy for you to manage and easy for your users to know what to expect.

Copying a page
Here’s how to copy an existing page:
1. Click the Copy button located in the Page Functions section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Page Management page where you set the information
of the new page.
2. Complete all the Page Details settings.
See Steps 2-9 in “Adding a page” earlier in this section for more details.
3. Select the name of the page you want to copy from the Copy Modules
From field in the Copy Page section.
The page you were last on will be selected by default. The title and loca-
tion of each module on the selected page is now displayed at the Copy
Content field. Note: If the page doesn’t have any modules, there is no
benefit to copying it!
4. Clear the check box beside any module that you don’t want to copy.
5. Enter a new title for each module to be copied.
Alternatively, you may prefer to keep the original title.
6. Select the New, Copy, or Reference radio button to define the content
you want to copy from each module.
Select New to copy the module without any content. Select Copy to copy
the module and its content. This creates a new version of this content,
which can be edited independently of the original content. Select
Reference to copy the module and create a new version of the content
inside the module. Editing content in a referenced module also updates
the content in the original module.
7. Click the Update link.
The page name is now displayed in the menu, unless it was set with a
parent page; in that case, you will need to mouse over the parent page
and click on the page name to view it. Any copied modules will be dis-
played on the page.
Adding a page set as a link 
to a URL, page, or file
DNN provides you with the ability to create a page that links to another Web
page or file. This feature is a great shortcut when you want to display one
page in two different locations on the Web site menu, or if you want to use
the menu to provide people with access to commonly request files.
96
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

Here’s how to add a page that links to a URL, page, or file:
1. Click the Add button located in the Page Functions section of the
Control Panel.
This displays the Page Management page where you set the information
of the new page.
2. Complete all the Page Details settings.
See Steps 2-9 in the section called “Adding a page” earlier in this chapter
for more details.
3. Click the Maximize button at Advanced Settings.
This displays all the advanced page settings. The link settings are
located in the Other Settings section.
4. Select URL (A Link to an External Resource), Page (A Page on Your
Site), or File (A File on Your Site) from the Link Type options listed for
the Link URL field.
Selecting URL displays a text box where you can enter a Web site
address. This option takes the person to that Web site when they click on
this page in the menu. Selecting Page displays a list of pages on the Web
site that you can select from. This option takes the person to that page
on this Web site when they click on this page in the menu. Selecting File
displays a list of files uploaded to the File Manager. This option displays
the selected file to the person when they click on the page in the menu.
5. Enter the URL, or select the page or file per your selection at Step 4.
6. Click the Update link.
Changing the order of your pages
The Control Panel across the top of each page enables Administrators to per-
form most of the tasks required to manage pages; however, one task that
can’t be managed here is changing the order of pages in the menu.
Here’s how to move a page to a new location in the menu:
1. Select Admin➪Pages from the module menu.
This displays the Pages page, where you can change the order of pages
in the menu. All pages are listed here. Parent pages are listed to the left.
Child pages are indicated by . . . PageName, where PageName is replaced
by the actual name of the page.
2. Locate and click on the name of the page you want to move in the list
of pages.
97
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

3. Select one of the following options.
• Click the left arrow to move a child page up one position within the
parent/child hierarchy. Any child pages of this page retain their
relationship with this page.
• Click the right arrow to move a child page down one position
within the parent/child hierarchy. Any child pages of this page
retain their relationship with this page. For example, in Figure 4-8,
clicking the right arrow makes the FAQs page a child of the
Services page. The two child pages of the FAQs page (For Builders
and For Individuals) remain children of the FAQs page.
• Click the up arrow to move the page up one position within the
current level. Any child pages of this page retain their relationship
with this page. For example, in Figure 4-8, clicking the up arrow
moves the FAQs page above Services page, displaying itfarther left
in the menu. The two child pages of the FAQs page (For Builders
and For Individuals) remain children of the FAQs page.
• Click the down-arrow button to move the page down one position
within the current level. Any child pages of this page retain their
relationship with this page. For example, in Figure 4-8, clicking the
down arrow moves the FAQs page below the Contact Us page, dis-
playing it one position farther right in the menu. The two child
pages of the FAQs page (For Builders and For Individuals) remain
children of the FAQs page.
Adding Content to a Page
After you have added one or more pages to your Web site, you can begin
adding content modules to those pages. A module manages content of a par-
ticular flavor. The name of a module usually gives a good clue as to the type
Figure 4-8:
Move the
position of a
page in the
menu.
98
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

of content it manages. For example, the Links module allows you to display a
list of links, the Feedback module displays a feedback form, and the
Text/HTML module allows you to add text or HTML. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 pro-
vide detailed explanations of the purpose of each module and info on how to
manage records for each module. In this section, we provide an overview of
how to add and delete modules from a page and discuss some of the many
settings available on each module.
Adding a new module to a page
You must be logged in as the Administrator or as a user with permission to
edit a page to add modules to the Web site. See “Setting view and edit permis-
sions for a page” to find out how to enable users to also add modules to a
page. After you’re logged in, the Control Panel will be displayed above the
menu. The middle section of the Control Panel manages adding modules.
Here’s how to add a new module to a page:
1. Navigate to the page you want to add the module to.
2. Leave the Add New Module radio button selected.
3. Select Text/HTML from the drop-down box beside the Module field, as
shown in Figure 4-9.
4. (Optional.) Enter a title for the module into the Title text box.
The title is displayed as a heading in the module container above any
content you later add to the module. If you don’t enter a title, the name
of the module will be added automatically.
5. Leave the Visibility field set to Same As Page.
This means that all roles that have been given View Page permissions
are able to view the module. The other option is Page Editors Only. This
option means that only members of roles with Edit Page permissions are
able to view the module. This option is useful if you are adding the
module to a page that is visible to all users and you want to set it up and
add content to it before your visitors see it.
6. (Optional.) Select the name of the pane you want to add the module to.
The main pane in the center of the page is called the ContentPane. This
is the default pane the module will be added to. Selecting a different
pane here adds the module into that pane instead. You can easily move
the module to another pane later if you need to.
7. Leave the Insert field set on Bottom.
This adds the module below any other modules that are located inside
the pane selected at Pane. Alternatively, you can choose to insert the
module on top of any existing modules. It is easy to move modules
around if you later choose to do so.
99
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

8. Leave the Align field set on Left.
This sets the alignment of content within the module.
9. Click the Add button.
The module is now displayed on the page, awaiting your witty prose.
Figure 4-9 displays an example of the Add New Module section of the
Control Panel, as well as a Text/HTML module that has previously been
added to the ContentPane of this page.
Adding an existing module to a page
To save you time when building your Web site, DNN provides you with the
ability to display an existing module and its content on more than one page.
This is a great timesaver if, for example, you want to display a list of impor-
tant links on two pages of the Web site. By copying an existing module, you
don’t have to reenter all the links on the second page. You can also update a
link on one instance of the module and the change will appear in both lists.
Here’s how to add an existing module to a page:
1. Navigate to the page you want to add the module to.
You can’t add a second copy of the module to the same page.
2. Select the Add Existing Module radio button from the Control Panel.
3. Select the page name from the drop-down box beside the Page field.
Figure 4-9:

Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

4. Select the module title from the drop-down box beside the Module field.
5. Select the name of the pane you want to add the module to.
The main pane in the center of the page is called the ContentPane.
Selecting a different pane name here adds the module into that pane
instead. You can easily move the module to another pane later if you
need to.
6. Leave the Insert field set on Bottom.
This adds the module below any other modules that are located inside
the pane selected at Pane. Alternatively, you can choose to insert the
module on top of any existing modules. It is easy to move modules
around if you later choose to do so.
7. Leave the Align field set on Left.
This sets the alignment of content within the module.
8. Click the Add button.
The module is now copied to the page and any future content changes
will be displayed on both instances of the module.
Deleting, moving, and performing other
module tasks by using the module menu
When you are logged in as the Administrator, a small arrow is displayed to
the left of the module title. Mouse over that arrow and you will see a drop-
down menu, shown in Figure 4-10, that enables you to do all the things you
want to do with a module, such as deleting and moving modules. It also pro-
vides access to the Module Settings page where module details, permissions,
design, and more can be changed.
Here’s an overview of the functions on the module menu in the order they
appear on the menu:
 Edit or Add New: Click this option to add or edit module content. This
option is displayed to Administrators and role members with edit rights
to the module. See “Setting module permissions” later in this chapter to
find out how to set edit and view rights to modules.
 Import Content: Click this option to import content to this module.
Content must first be exported before it can be imported. For example,
you could import a list of links from one links module to another links
module. This creates a brand-new version of the content that can be
edited independently of the module that the content was exported from.
This option is only available to Administrators and Page Editors (that is,
role members who have been given edit page permissions), and is only
available on some modules.
101
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

 Export Content: Click this option to export the content of this module
for future importing to another module of the same type. This option is
available to Administrators and Page Editors. See the earlier section
“Setting view and edit permissions for a page” for more details.
 Help: Click this option to view basic information on using this module.
This option is displayed to Administrators, Page Editors, and Module
Editors (that is, members of roles with edit rights to the module). See
“Setting module permissions” later in this chapter for more information.
 Online Help: Click this option to view detailed online help on using
DNN. This help is written and maintained by Lorraine Young, one of the
authors of this book, for the DNN Core Team. This option is displayed to
Administrators, Page Editors, and Module Editors.
 Print: Click this option to view a print version of the content within this
module. This option is displayed to Administrators, Page Editors, and
Module Editors.
 Settings: Click this option to view and manage the settings of this
module. Module settings are discussed in detail later in this chapter: See
“Tweaking module settings.” This option is only available to
Administrators and Page Editors.
 Delete: Click this option to delete the module from the page. This option
is only available to Administrators and Page Editors.
 Clear Cache: Click this option to refresh the stored information of this
module. This ensures that other people browsing your Web site only see
the latest updated information inside this module. This option is only
available to Administrators and Page Editors.
 Move: Mouse over this option to see a list of panes on this page and
then select the name of the pane you want to move it to. This option is
only available to Administrators and Page Editors.

Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

Setting module permissions
Module permission settings enable the Administrator to control which roles can
view the module (View Module permissions) and which roles can add, edit, and
delete content within the module (Edit Module permission). Some advanced
modules have additional role settings, which provide more refined permissions;
however, View Module and Edit Module permissions are the most common.
Here’s how to set the permissions on a module to control which roles can
view a module and manage its content:
1. Select Settings from any module menu.
This goes to the settings page for this module.
2. In the Basic Settings section, select <All Roles>from the Filter by Group
drop-down box beside Permissions to view a full list of all roles.
This option is only visible if one or more role groups have been added to
the Web site as shown in “Adding a new role group” earlier in this chap-
ter. If this option isn’t displayed, skip to Step 3.
A checked box in the Edit Module column indicates that members of the
role can edit the content of the module.
3. Deselect the Inherit View Permissions from Page check box if you
want to change the roles that can view the module.
This makes all the check boxes in the View Module column available for
selection. Changing this setting allows you to hide this module from one
or more roles that have access to view this page. The Inherit View
Permissions from Page check box is selected by default, which means all
roles that can view the page can also view the module. If you don’t want
to change view permissions, skip to Step 5.
4. Select the check box for each role in the View Module column of the
Permissions field that you want to be able to view the module.
The Administrators role is automatically checked and can’t be
unchecked. Members of roles selected here can view the module and its
content but do not have any editing rights.
5. Select the check box beside each role in the Edit Module column of
the Permissions field that you want to be able to edit the module.
The Administrators role is automatically checked and can’t be
unchecked. Members of roles selected here can add, edit, and delete
module content; however, they can’t modify the module settings, move,
or delete the module itself.
6. Click the Update link.
You are now returned to the page.
103
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

Tweaking module settings
If you need to change something apart from the content of the module, the
Module Settings page is the place to come. Module settings enable you to con-
trol all aspects of a module apart from its content. Module settings include
module permissions (as discussed above), module publishing dates, module
title, module layout, the location of the module on the Web site, container
design, and more.
Here’s how to change module settings:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This opens the Module Settings page of this module, as shown in 
Figure 4-11.
2. Edit any of the Basic Settings. These settings apply to every instance
of this module on the Web site:
• Modify the Module Title: The module title is displayed above the
module content. Alternatively, you can edit this on the page by
clicking on it.
• Modify module Permissions: This controls which roles can view
and edit the module. See “Setting module permissions” earlier in
this chapter for more details.
3. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings to edit more
options:
• Display Module on All Pages?: Select this check box to display this
module on every page of the Web site. The module will be displayed
in the same pane as this module; however, you can move the module
to a different pane on any page without affecting other pages.
• Header: Enter any text to be displayed between the module title
and module content. For example, if the module contains a list of
documents, the header may offer assistance or more information,
such as Our product price lists are listed below. Click on the link
beside a price list to download it.
• Footer: Enter any text to be displayed below the module content.
• Start Date: Click the Calendar link and select the first day you want
the module to appear on the Web site. Prior to this date, the
module will only be displayed to Administrator and Page Editors.
• End Date: Click the Calendar link and select the last day you want
the module to appear on the Web site. The module will only be dis-
played to Administrator and Page Editors after this date.
4. Click the Update link.
The changes will be applied to the module.

Moving a module to another page
Here’s how to move a module to another page:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This opens the Module Settings page of this module.
2. Click the Maximize button beside Page Settings.
3. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings.
4. Select the page to move the module to from the Move To Page field.
5. Click the Update link.
This module is now located on the selected page. It will be positioned at
the bottom of the same pane as the previous page. If the same pane
doesn’t exist on the new page, it will instead be added to the bottom of
the content pane.

Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

Managing Web Site Files
DNN provides a central place to upload and manage the images, movies and
other types of files that can be viewed and downloaded from your Web site.
That place is called the File Manager and it is located under the Admin page
on the Web site menu.
Only Administrators can access the File Manager; however, they can enable
roles to view the files within one or more folders and upload files to one or
more folders.
Getting familiar with the File Manager
The File Manager is divided into the following six sections, as shown in 
Figure 4-12:
 Folders toolbar: This toolbar enables the Administrator to perform
administrative tasks on a folder that is selected in the Folders window.
 Files toolbar: This toolbar enables the Administrator to manage the files
selected in the Files window.
 Folders window: This area displays a list of folders in a hierarchical tree
structure. When a folder is selected, any files inside that folder are dis-
played in the Files window to the right.
 Files window: This area displays the files associated with the selected
folder. Ten (10) files are displayed by default. The filename, date, and
size of the files are displayed. The default order of these files is alpha-
numeric by filename; however, they can be reverse ordered or ordered
by another field by clicking on a linked heading above the files.
An Edit and Delete button is displayed beside each file enabling
Administrators to edit or delete a single file. A check box beside each file
enables one or more files to be modified simultaneously, and the Select
All button enables all displayed files to be modified. The check boxes
are used in conjunction with the Files toolbar.
Below the listed files are details of how many pages of files are con-
tained within the currently selected folder and navigation buttons to
move between these pages.

Uploading a file to the File Manager
Here’s how the Administrator can upload one or more files to the File
Manager:
1. Click the Files button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
This goes to the Admin➪File Manager page where the File Manager is
located. Folders are listed down the left and the files inside each folder
are displayed to the right.
2. Click the Upload button located above the list of files.
This takes you to the File Upload page.
3. Click the Browse button and select the file from your computer.
You can either upload a single file or save time by uploading a .ZIP file
containing several files.
4. Select the folder that you want to upload the file to from the drop-
down box below.
You can only upload one file or one .ZIP file to one folder at a time.
5. Select the Decompress .ZIP Files? check box if you are uploading a
.ZIP file that you want to decompress.
When uploading a .ZIP file, you have two options. Selecting this option
enables you to decompress the file so that each of the files appears sep-
arately in the folder as well as the .ZIP file. Alternatively, if you do not
check this option, the .ZIP file uploads as a single file.
6. Click the Save File link.
You are now returned to the File Manager.
If you receive a warning message that the file is a restricted file type, your
Web site doesn’t allow you to upload this type of file. See Chapter 3 to find
out how to change this: You need host access to do so.
Delete a single file
Here’s how to delete a single file:
1. Click the Files button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
2. Click the Maximize button beside Portal Root folder in the Folders
Window.
108
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

This displays any folders inside the Portal Root folder. Repeat this step
to open additional folders.
3. Click on a folder name in the Folders window to select it.
This displays the first ten files inside this folder in the Files window. If
the required file isn’t displayed, use the navigation buttons to move to it.
Alternatively, you can search for the file.
4. Click the Delete button beside the file to be deleted.
Working with multiple files 
inside the File Manager
The File Manager uses a folder and file organization structure that is familiar
to most computer users. A list of folders appears down the left side. When a
folder name is selected, the files inside that folder are displayed.
Here are a number of tasks you can perform on files within the File Manager:
1. Click the Files button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
2. Click on the Maximize button beside Portal Root folder in the Folders
Window.
Repeat this step to access additional folders.
3. Click on a folder name in the Folders window to select it.
This displays the first ten files inside this folder in the Files window. If
the desired files are not displayed, use the navigation buttons below to
navigate to them.
4. Select the check box beside one or more files, or click the Select All
button above the check boxes.
The checked files are now selected. Note: The Select All button only
selects all the files on the displayed page. To manage a larger number of
files at one time, change the Items Per Page field to 15, 20, 30, 40, or 50.
5. Here are some of the tasks you can now perform on these files:
• Copy Files: Click the Copy Files button to copy the files to another
folder. Click OK and repeat Steps 2 and 3 to select the folder and
then click OK again.
• Move Files: Click the Move Files button to move the files to
another folder. Click OK and repeat Steps 2 and 3 to select the new
folder and then click OK again.
109
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

When a file is moved, the new location of the file is updated across
the site wherever the file is in use. The exception is when a file
such as a file link or an image that is displayed in the Rich Text
Editor (RTE) is moved. In this case, the file link will not work or the
image will no longer be displayed. This happens because the loca-
tion of the path is saved into the RTE. If this occurs, you will need
to reselect the image in the related RTEs.
• Delete Files: Click the Delete Files button to delete the files and
then click OK.
Creating a new folder
Only Administrators can add folders to the File Manager. Folders let you orga-
nize the files used on your Web site, similar to the way you do it on your per-
sonal computer. Each folder can be set to enable one or more roles to have
access to view the files in the folder and to upload files to the folder. See the
next section, “Setting the role permissions for a folder,” for details.
Here’s how to add a new folder to the File Manager:
1. Click the Files button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
2. Navigate to and click on the name of the folder you want to add the
new folder underneath in the Folders list.
3. Enter a name for the new folder into the text box on the Folders 
toolbar.
4. Click the Add Folder button.
The folder is now displayed in the Folders list. By default, new folders
are set to enable All Users to view any files added to the folder and only
Administrators can upload files to the folder. You may now want to set
role permissions to this file.
Setting the role permissions for a folder
Administrators can set folders to enable one or more roles to have access to
view the files in the folder and to upload files to the folder via the add/edit
page of certain modules.
110
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

Here’s how to set the role permissions on a folder in the File Manager:
1. Click the Files button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
2. Navigate to and click on the name of the folder you want to set per-
mission for.
3. Go to the Folder Security Settings section and select <All Roles> if the
Filter by Group field is displayed.
This option is only visible if one or more role groups have been added to
the Web site as mentioned in “Adding a new role group” earlier in this
chapter. If this option isn’t displayed, skip to Step 4.
4. Select the check box beside each role in the View Folder column to
enable members of that role to view files in this folder.
This enables these role members to view the files within this folder
when they are displayed on the Web site. All Users is checked by default.
If All Users is not checked, people who aren’t logged in to Web site won’t
be able to view these folder files on their page and only members of the
selected roles will be able to see the files when logged in.
5. Select the check box beside each role in the Write to Folder column to
enable members of that role to upload files to this folder.
This enables these role members to upload new files to this folder.
Because these users cannot access the File Manager itself to upload new
files, access to upload files is achieved through adding or editing module
content. See “Uploading files without Administrator rights” later in this
chapter for more details.
6. Click the Update link.
Deleting an existing folder
Here’s how to delete a folder from the File Manager:
1. Click the Files button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
2. Navigate to and click on the name of the folder you want to delete.
Any files within the selected folder are displayed in the Files window to
the right. These files must be deleted or moved to another folder before
this folder can be deleted. Likewise, if this folder has any subfolders,
these must be deleted first.
111
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

3. Click the Delete Folder button on the Folder.
This displays a message box confirming the name of the folder to be
deleted.
4. Click OK.
The folder will now be deleted.
Synchronizing one or more folders 
with your database
If you have access to upload files directly to your Web site server with a pro-
tocol such as FTP, or someone else has uploaded files for you in this way, you
need to synchronize your File Manager to ensure that the files changed via
the server are accurately reflected in the File Manager.
Here’s how to synchronize File Manager folders:
1. Click the Files button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
2. Navigate to and click on the name of the folder you want to synchro-
nize in the Folders window.
To synchronize one or more child folders at a time, select their parent
folder.
3. Check the Recursive check box on the Folders toolbar if you want to
synchronize all the child folders of the selected folder.
Selecting the Recursive check box synchronizes all files inside both the
selected folder and any child folders. If this option isn’t selected, only
the selected folder is synchronized.
4. Click the Synchronize Files button on the Folder toolbar.
The folder will begin synchronizing. If the Recursive check box is
selected, all child folders will also be synchronized.
Uploading files without 
Administrator rights
Only Administrators can upload files with the File Manager interface; however,
users can upload files via the Add/Edit page of some modules. To do so, the
user must be a member of a role with access to upload files to one or more
File Manager folders. See “Setting the role permissions for a folder” for more
details.
112
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

The user must also be a member of a role with edit permissions of a module
that enables file upload. Modules that enable file upload are those that display
the Link Type field on the Add/Edit page. For example, the Announcements,
Blog, Documents, Links, News Feeds (RSS), and Media modules.
Here’s how role members with edit module permissions can view or upload a
file to the File Manager:
1. Select Add from the module menu.
This is the first item listed in the module menu. Depending on the module
you are using, the actual words displayed here will vary. For example, the
Links module displays Add Link, whereas the Announcements module dis-
plays Add New Announcement.
2. Ensure that the page displays the Link Type field.
If the Link Type control is not displayed, this module does not allow files
to be uploaded.
3. Select the File (A File on Your Site) radio button below the Link Type
field.
This displays the File Location and File Name drop-down boxes. Any File
Manager folders that the user has view access to will be listed in the File
Location drop-down box.
4. Select the folder to view or upload the file to from the File Location
drop-down box.
This will list the files within the folder in the File Name drop-down box.
5. Click the Upload New File link.
If the Update New File link is not displayed, the user doesn’t have access
to upload files to this folder.
6. Click the Browse button and locate and select the file from your 
computer.
This displays the filename in the text box to the left of the Browse button.
7. Click the Upload New File link.
This uploads the file to the File Manager and displays the filename in a
drop-down box. To upload more files, repeat Steps 4 through 7.
Making Your Site Look Good
One of the early accomplishments of DNN was to achieve separation between
the content within the Web site and the design used on the Web site. Unlike
113
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

common HTML editing programs, where you design a Web page and then add
the content directly inside the designed page, DNN manages these two ele-
ments separately, enabling one to be changed independently of the other.
The design of a DNN Web site is broken down into two main elements called
skins and containers. A skin refers to the design of the page and a container
refers to the design of a module. Typically, a designer creates a Skin Package
for a DNN Web site that consists of a number of different skins and containers
with the same look and feel. Because the design and content of a DNN Web
site are completely separate from each other, the skin and container can be
changed as often as you like. You can set a default skin and container for all
pages and modules on your Web site, as well as select different skins or con-
tainers for any page or module.
As well as containing skins and containers that provide designs for pages and
modules respectively, a Skin Package also contains a style sheet. A style sheet
is a document that sets the styles used in the skin. (Styles control elements
like the text color, size and font, the colors used in the menu, and so on.) A
Skin Package can include one style sheet to be used for all skins and contain-
ers in that package, or it may include a different style sheet for each skin and
container. DNN style sheets are Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Detailed cover-
age of CSS is outside the scope of this book, but you can find lots of informa-
tion on the WWW on writing CSS if you’re interested. If you do have a design
bent or are interested in understanding more about skinning, DNN core has
produced a document on building skins and containers called Skinning Guide.
You can download it from www.dotnetnuke.com/About/Documentation/
ProjectDocuments/tabid/478/Default.aspx.
Skins are stored in two areas of DNN: One is at Host➪Skins and the other is at
Admin➪Skins. Host skins are uploaded and managed by the host and Admin
skins are uploaded and managed by the Administrator. Skins maintained
under host are available to all portals, whereas skins maintained under
Admin are unique to that Web site.
Changing the site logo
Web sites typically display a logo image in the top-right corner of each page.
Most DNN skins also use this format.
Here’s how to set the site logo:
1. Upload the logo to the Admin➪File Manager.
See “Uploading a file to the File Manager” earlier in this chapter for more
details.
114
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

2. Click the Site button located in the Common Tasks section of the
Control Panel.
3. Go to the Appearance section.
4. Select the folder where the logo is located from the File Location
drop-down list beside the Logo field.
This displays a list of images within this folder in the File Name drop-
down list below.
5. Select the logo from the File Name drop-down list.
6. Click the Update link.
This saves these settings.
Changing the default skin and containers
The Administrator can set a default skin and container to be used on all new
pages added to the Web site. Skins and containers can be stored in two
places — under Host➪Skins and under Admin➪Skins. Skins under Host are
maintained by the host account, whereas the Administrator maintains those
under Admin.
Here’s how to set the default skin and container:
1. Navigate to the Admin➪Site Settings page.
This displays the Site Settings page, where you can set details specific to
this Web site.
2. Go to the Appearance section.
3. Select either the Host or Site radio button at the Portal Skin field to
view the skins uploaded to that area.
Selecting Host displays the skins managed on the Host➪Skin page;
selecting Site displays the skins managed on the Admin➪Skin page. Host
skins are available to all Web sites within the portal, whereas Site skins
are only available for use on this Web site. The Portal Skin field sets the
default skin to be used on all new Web site pages apart from the Admin
Skin pages, which you will set at Step 6.
4. Select the skin from the drop-down list.
5. Click the Preview link to see what the skin looks like.
This opens a new Web browser with an example of the skin.
115
Chapter 4: Getting Your Site Started on the Right Foot

6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 to set the Portal Container, Admin Skin, and
Admin Container fields.
The Portal Container field sets the default container to be used on all
modules. The Admin Skin and Admin Container fields set the default skin
and container to be used on Administration (Admin) and add/edit pages.
Typically, the Admin Skin only has one large pane. The Admin Skin and
Admin Container are also used on the default Login and User pages.
7. Click the Update link.
This saves and immediately applies these settings.
Every page and module has its own settings page where the skin and con-
tainer to be used on it can be set. Setting the default designs for the Web site
doesn’t override these individual settings. See “Setting the skin and container
designs for an individual page” to find out how to change the designs set on
an individual page, or see “Setting the container for an individual module” to
find out how to set the container design on an individual module.
Viewing and applying skins
DNN provides administrators with a skins Gallery where they can view and
select skins and containers to be used on the Web site, and where they can
upload new skins, containers, and skin packages.
Here’s how to view and apply skins to the Web site:
1. Select Admin➪Skins from the main menu.
This opens the Skins page for this Web site, which displays thumbnail
images of the skins and containers on your Web site, as shown in Figure
4-13. The name of the displayed skins package is shown at the Skins
field.
2. Select the skins you want to preview by checking one or both of the
Host and Site check boxes at the Skin Type field.
3. Select the name of a skin or skin package from the Skins drop-down
box to view a thumbnail image of all the skins and containers within
that Skin Package.
Thumbnail images of the related skins and containers are displayed.
4. Click the Preview link below any skin to preview it.
This opens a new Web browser with an example of that skin.
5. Select either or both of the Portal or Admin check boxes beside the
Apply To field below the thumbnail images to choose where you
would like to apply the new skin or container.
116
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

Selecting Portal will apply your selection to all Web site pages or con-
tainers except on the Administration pages, and the Login and
Registration pages. Selecting Admin will apply your selection to the
Administration pages, and the Login and Registration pages.
6. Click the Apply link below any skin or container to apply it.
This applies the selected skin or container to either the portal or admin
pages or containers as selected at Step 5.
This setting overrides but doesn’t change the Default skin we show you how
to set in the previous section. You can restore the Default skin at any time by
clicking the Restore Default Skin link on the Admin➪Skins page.

Uploading a skin to your Web site
DNN comes with a selection of skin packages; however, if you want some-
thing more special, you can buy or design a skin just for you. After you have
your new skin, you will need to upload it to your Web site.
You can download information on how to build a skin from www.dotnetnuke.
com/About/Documentation/ProjectDocuments/tabid/478/Default.

Here’s how to upload a skin to your Web site:
1. Select Admin➪Skins from the main menu.
This opens the Skins page for this Web site. Depending on the settings
given to you by your host, or set by you under host, Administrators may
or may not be able to upload a skin. For this example, we assume you
have been given the ability to upload skins. See Chapter 3 to find out
how to enable Administrators to upload skins.
2. Select Upload Skin from the Skins module menu.
This opens the File Upload page specifically for uploading skins and skin
packages.
3. Click the Browse button and select the skin package from your 
computer.
4. Click the Save File link.
This adds the skin to the Admin ➪Skin page.
Setting the skin and container designs

This optional setting opens a new Web browser with an example of the
skin. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to choose another skin.
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 at the Page Container field to set the contain-
ers for this page.
This sets the container applied to all modules on this page. This setting
overrides the default container setting but does not override the con-
tainer where it is set on the settings page of an individual module.
7. Click the Update link.
Setting the container for 
an individual module
A container is the design applied to a module, and changing it can transform
the appearance of a module and its content. Containers set all the design ele-
ments of a module, as well as the styles applied to the content within the
module such as the default font type, size, and color. Each module can be set
to display a different container, including instances of the same module
located on different pages.
Here’s how to set the container on a module:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This opens the Module Settings page for this module.
2. Click the Maximize button beside the Page Settings section.
This section enables you to define settings specific to this particular
occurrence of this module.
3. Select the check box beside the Display Container? field.
This setting must be selected for the container to be displayed.

Delivering Content Right 
Out of the Box
In This Chapter
 Doing almost anything with the Text/HTML module
 Keeping users informed with FAQs
 Getting around with links
 Letting everyone know with announcements
 Downloading by using documents
 Sneaking a peek with IFrame
 Showing it with media
W
hen buying a new home, the catch phrase you hear is, “Location, loca-
tion, location.” When building a new Web site, the catch phrase is
“Content, content, content!” No one is interested in visiting a Web site with
little or no content, out-of-date content, or really boring content. Content is
king! And if you haven’t written, obtained, or stolen some yet, now’s the time.
In this chapter, we show you how to use eight different modules that come
with DNN. These are the modules that display static information such as a
list of frequently asked questions, a list of announcements, or a list of down-
loadable documents.
This chapter shows you how to use two of the fundamental tools of most
modules you encounter. The first is the Rich Text Editor (RTE), which enables
you to manage and format rich text. The second is the Link tool used in the
Links module. This tool is used wherever you need to set a link to a page, a
URL, or a file on your Web site. Master these and you are well on your way
with DNN.

Doing Almost Anything with Text/HTML
The DNN Text/HTML module enables you to add text, images, links, and
tables to the pages of your Web site. Essentially, this module is the Swiss
Army knife of modules as it offers all the functionality of a word processor. 
In fact, you could build your whole Web site by using only this module.
The Text/HTML module provides you with a variety of ways to create and
edit text including editing directly on the Web page, by using a Rich Text
Editor, and by using an HTML editor.
Plain text editing
Here’s how to create and edit text directly on your Web site page:
1. Click on some text in a Text/HTML module.
If this is the first time you have edited this module, the text will read
“Click Here To Enter Your Content.” Clicking on the text displays a red
box around it, which indicates that you can now edit the text.
2. Edit the text as required.
Common word processing shortcuts work in this editing window, so
experiment for a while. Don’t worry: You can’t break it! Some of the
shortcuts that work include pressing Ctrl+B to bold a word, Ctrl+U to
underline a word, or Ctrl+I to italicize a word.
3. Click outside the red box to exit editing.
The red box disappears and you are taken out of editing mode.
Working with the Basic Text Box
Another way to enter text into the Text/HTML module is by using the Basic
Text Box feature. In this section, we show you how to copy only the text from
another source, such as an e-mail or an existing Web site, leaving behind any
text formatting so the text uses the same layout and fonts as the rest of your
Web site.
Here’s how to add plain text into a Text/HTML module:
1. Select Edit Text from the module menu.
This takes you to the Edit Text/HTML page.
124
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

2. Click the Basic Text Box radio button above the Editor.
The Basic Text Box is now displayed.
3. Enter text into the Basic Text Box.
You can also cut and paste text from an e-mail, word document, and so
on. Because you are not using a Rich Text Editor, any Word formatting is
discarded.
4. Click the Update link.
The text is now displayed, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Because you updated the Text/HTML module when it was switched to Basic
Text Box, the next time you use a Text/HTML module, the Editor will display
in the Basic Text Box.
From rags to riches with Rich Text Editor
The Text/HTML module includes a text editor called the Rich Text Editor (RTE).
The RTE is used in many other DNN modules, so it is worthwhile for you to get
familiar with this module first. After you have mastered it, you’re well on your
way to understanding how to use a whole bunch of other modules.
The Rich Text Editor includes nearly all the features you expect from a word
processor. The RTE contains more than 40 different buttons, so it would be a
waste of space to talk you through each of them, but here’s how you can see
what the RTE buttons do:
1. Select Edit Text from the module menu.
This takes you to the Edit Text/HTML page.

2. Ensure that the Rich Text Editor radio button is selected.
This displays the RTE.
3. Click inside the RTE window and type some text.
4. Select some of your text.
5. Place your mouse over any button.
This displays a tooltip explaining what the button does; for example, the
Underline button underlines any selected text.
6. Click a button to try it out.
You can experiment all you like and the text won’t be displayed on the
page until you click the Update link. Go wild!
Discarding unwanted text formatting
When you are building a new Web site, you often need to transfer existing infor-
mation into the Web site. Maybe you need to transfer information from your
old Web site, or existing documents such as Microsoft Word files. One of the
problems with doing this is that the text may include formatting that will over-
ride the styles set in the style sheet you have applied to your Web site. This
means the text won’t be standardized, especially if you are cutting and pasting
text from a number of different sources. The effect can be unprofessional and
tacky. This can all be avoided by cleaning the text. Cleaning removes all the
unnecessary formatting from the text so it looks good on the page and matches
the rest of your Web site.
Here’s how to copy text from another source and discard unwanted formatting:
1. Select Edit Text from the module menu.
This displays the Edit Text/HTML page.
2. Ensure that the Rich Text Editor radio button is selected.
This displays the RTE.
3. Open your document and copy the information you want to add to
this Text/HTML module.
You can copy text from another Web site, a Word document, a PDF, and
so on. You can’t copy images into the Web site this way. See “Inserting
images into the RTE” later in this chapter for more details.
4. Click inside the RTE window in the place where you want to insert the
information and then click the Paste button.
The text is now displayed inside the RTE.
126
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

5. Click the Clean MS Word HTML button.
The layout and style of the text will change and only basic formatting
like headings remains. Depending on the amount of formatting that has
been removed, you will probably need to modify the layout of the text
now. Don’t be dismayed: It’s worth the effort in the long run!
6. Click the Preview link below the RTE to see how the text will look on
the page.
Clicking Preview displays the text at the bottom of the page. The text in
the RTE window doesn’t display the styles from your style sheet, only
those set by using the RTE. Previewing your text lets you see how it will
look after the styles have been applied.
7. Click the Update link to save.
This returns you to your Web page.
The Clean MS Word HTML button also removes any formatting added by
using the Styles, Paragraph, Font, and Size drop-down selection boxes. If you
have gone too wild with adding headings and styles and fonts and colors,
clicking the Clean MS Word HTML button is the best way of starting afresh!
Adding styles to text
One toolbar worth a bit of explanation is the Styles toolbar at the very top of
the RTE. This toolbar lets you change the size and font of your text by select-
ing options from the Size and Font drop-down boxes respectively.
This tool bar also includes two additional drop-down list boxes called Styles
and Paragraph. The Paragraph option lets you select text and change it to a
Heading style such as Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on. The styles of these
headings are set up in the style sheet applied to this page. See Chapter 4 
for more details.
The final option is the Styles drop-down selection box. Like the Paragraph
drop-down list box, it applies formatting to your text according to the style
sheet applied to this page. The Styles drop-down list box displays all the
styles from your style sheet.
Adding a Web site link to the RTE
Here’s how to add a link to another Web site by using the Text/HTML module:
1. Select Edit Text from the module menu.
This displays the Edit Text/HTML page.
127
Chapter 5: Delivering Content Right Out of the Box

2. Ensure that the Rich Text Editor radio button is selected.
This displays the RTE.
3. Highlight the text or image you want to add the link to and click the
Create Link button.
This displays the Insert Link window, as shown in Figure 5-2.
4. Enter the Web site URL into the text box below Location:
Ensure that http:// is only entered once in this box.
5. (Optional.) Select the Open Link in New Browser Window? check box
This setting is optional; however, opening a new browser is the typical
way Web sites work when linking to a different Web site.
6. Click the OK button.
The link will now be added; however, it is not clickable within the editor.
7. Click the Update link.
This returns you to your Web page, where you will be able to click on
the link.
See the “Getting Around with Links” section later in this chapter to find out
how to set links to pages and files within your Web site. Along with getting
comfortable with the RTE, discovering how to work with links is the other
major “must-know” of building DNN Web pages.

Inserting images into the RTE
Here’s how to insert an image by using the RTE:
1. Select Edit Text from the module menu.
This displays the Edit Text/HTML page.
2. Ensure that the Rich Text Editor radio button is selected.
This displays the RTE.
3. Position the cursor where you want to add the image.
4. Click the Insert Image from Gallery button.
This displays the Image Gallery window, as shown in Figure 5-3. An icon
for each folder in the Administrator’s File Manager is displayed, as well
as a thumbnail picture of any image inside the root folder.
5. Double-click on a folder to view the images inside it and then single-
click on the image to preview it.
The image you select for previewing is displayed in the Preview window
to the right. The Dimensions section displays size information and
enables modifying of these values. The Properties section lets you add
borders and align the image. You don’t have to modify any of these sec-
tions to insert the image. Skip to Step 8 if you just want to add the image
without changing its size or alignment.
6. To scale the image, click the Percentage radio button beside
Percentage and enter a percentage.
For example, entering 50 scales the image down to 50% of its original
height. The size of the scaled image is displayed in the Preview window
above.
7. To set the alignment of the image in the RTE, select an option from the
Align drop-down box in the Properties section.
The default setting of NotSet aligns the bottom of the image with the
bottom of any text on the same line. The other options are
• Top: Aligns the top of the image with the top of the text
• Bottom: Aligns the bottom of the image with the bottom of the text
• Left: Aligns the image to the left of the module
• Right: Aligns the image to the right of the module
• AbsMiddle: Aligns middle of the image with the middle of the text
• Center: Aligns middle of the image with the middle of the text
129
Chapter 5: Delivering Content Right Out of the Box

Do not use the Center option to center align an image. Instead, you are
better off inserting the image and then using the Center button on the
main RTE toolbar. The Center option in the Insert image dialog box
appears to have the same effect as the Absolute Middle. Using the
Center align button on the toolbar after you have inserted the image
gives a more logical result.
8. Click the Insert button.
The image is now added into the RTE.
9. Click the Update link.
This returns you to your Web page where you will be able to view 
the image.
You can move the position of the image by clicking on the image and then
dragging and dropping it in a new position.
If a file link or an image inserted into the RTE moved to a new File Manager
folder, the file link will no longer work and the image will no longer be dis-
played. This happens because the location of the path is saved into the RTE.
If this occurs, you will need to reselect the image in the related RTEs.

Uploading images to the RTE Image Gallery
Here’s how to upload an image into the File Manager via the RTE interface:
1. Select Edit Text from the module menu.
This displays the Edit Text/HTML page.
2. Ensure that the Rich Text Editor is selected.
This displays the RTE.
3. Click the Insert Image from Gallery button.
This displays the Image Gallery window. You can see folders within the
Administrator’s File Manager as well as thumbnail pictures of any
images inside the root folder.
4. Double-click on the Folder you want to upload the image to.
This opens the folder and displays any existing images inside this folder.
5. Click the Browse button beside Upload File.
This opens a dialog box enabling you to locate the image on your 
computer.
6. Select the image from your computer and click the Upload button.
A thumbnail picture of the image is now displayed in the folder. You can
now close the Image Gallery window, or if you want to use the image in
your Web site now, select the image and insert it.
Adding a table
The RTE provides you with the ability to create tables. I personally prefer to
use the User Defined Table module to manage tables of information and sug-
gest you take a look at this module as a better alternative. (Flip to Chapter 6
for more on User Defined Tables.) However, for creating simple tables, you
might like to give the RTE a try.
Here’s how to create a table by using the RTE:
1. Select Edit Text from the module menu.
This displays the Edit Text/HTML page.
2. Ensure that the Rich Text Editor radio button is selected.
This displays the RTE.
3. Position your cursor where you want to add the table and click the
Insert Table button.
This displays the Table Editor window, as shown in Figure 5-4.
131
Chapter 5: Delivering Content Right Out of the Box

4. Enter a number into the Rows text box to set the number of rows in
the table.
Rows go down the page. The default setting is two rows.
5. Enter a number into the Cols text box to set the number of columns in
the table.
Columns go across the page. The default setting is four columns.
6. Click the OK button to insert your table.
The empty table is now displayed in the RTE and you can add text or
images to each table cell.
7. Click the Update link.
This returns you to your Web page, where you can view the table.
To edit a table click inside the table and click the Edit Table button.
Accessing the HTML code
This book won’t attempt to show you how to write HTML code. If you 
are interested in mastering HTML, you can find lots of books and online
resources to help you do this. (Check out HTML 4 For Dummies, by Ed Tittel
and Mary Burmeister, published by Wiley, for starters.) However, if you do
know how to write HTML, you can either create it in your favorite HTML
editor and copy and paste it into the RTE, or you can code straight into the
RTE. The choice is yours.
Figure 5-4:
Create
tables in the
RTE by
using the
Table Editor.
132
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

As we mention previously, we recommend the User Defined Tables module
over the RTE Table Editor. This isn’t because the RTE Table Editor is faulty, but
you need some HTML knowledge to get the most out of it. If you do know some
HTML, you will be confident enough to switch to the HTML tab below the
window and edit the table HTML. If you aren’t confident, give it a try anyway.
Here’s how to access the HTML editor of the Rich Text Box:
1. Select Edit Text from the module menu.
This takes you to the Edit Text/HTML page.
2. Ensure that the Rich Text Editor radio button is selected.
This displays the RTE.
3. Select the HTML tab below the RTE window.
This displays the HTML code for the page.
4. Create or paste your HTML code.
5. Click the Update link.
This saves your HTML and returns you to the page.
If you do feel comfortable tinkering, at least a little, with the HTML, you can
fix a few common problems that you may experience with your RTE tables.
For example, you may notice that the text inside the table is larger than the
text on the rest of the page. Here’s how to make the table text the same size
as the normal text size:
1. Click the HTML tab at the base of the RTE window.
This displays the entire HTML code for this page, but don’t panic just yet!
2. Find the <TABLE tag inside the HTML code.
You can do this quickly by pressing Ctrl+F and entering <TABLE into the
Find box that appears.
3. Replace <TABLE with <TABLE class=”normal”.
This step changes all the text in the table to the normal style used on
your Web site.
4. Click the Design tab.
This displays the table and other content in Normal view.
5. Click the Update link.
This returns you to your Web page, where you will be able to view 
the table.
133
Chapter 5: Delivering Content Right Out of the Box

You do not need to enter text in each table cell; however, if a cell is empty, its
border won’t display correctly. To fix this, simply add a space into the cell.
The width of table cells changes as you add text and images to them. This
can result in scrappy-looking tables. The Table Editor gives you an option to
create tables with a pixel width setting rather than a percentage setting, but if
you enter too much text into a cell, it will simply push out the size of the
table anyway.
Here’s how to make all table cells the same width:
1. Count the number of columns in your table and formulate a percent-
age for each one totaling 100%.
For example, if you have four columns and want to set them all to the
same width, they should be 25% each.
2. Select the HTML tab below the RTE window.
This displays the HTML code for the page.
3. Locate the HTML code that reads <TR><TD>.
If the <TD> doesn’t have <TR> before it, it isn’t the right code. The HTML
is displayed on separate lines, like this:
<TR>
<TD>
4. Edit all four of the <TD> code sections so that they read <TD
width=”25%”>.
This sets the width for each section to 25%.
The HTML now looks like this:
<TR>
<TD width=”25%”>
5. Click the Update link.
This saves your changes and returns you to the page.
If you are already familiar with a HTML editor such as Microsoft FrontPage,
you can create your tables in FrontPage and cut and paste them into the RTE.
Keeping Users Informed with FAQs
The World Wide Web, better known as the WWW, is full of acronyms. Here’s
another one for you: FAQ is the acronym for frequently asked question. The
FAQs module is designed to manage and display a list of frequently asked
questions and their answers. The benefit of this module is that it provides
134
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

visitors to your Web site with a place to go and find answers to their ques-
tions. It also gives you a place to continuously add new questions and
answers, or modify questions and answers as the need arises.
The FAQs module displays each question as a link. Site users must click on 
a question to view the related answer, as shown in Figure 5-5. This layout
ensures that the module doesn’t take up too much space on the page and
makes it easy for users to quickly scan for their question.
Adding an FAQ
Here’s how to add a frequently asked question and answer to the FAQs module:
1. Select Add New FAQ from the module menu.
This displays the Edit FAQs page.
2. Enter the question into the RTE displayed below the Question field.
You can use any of the RTE features to best describe the question, such
as inserting an image. See the section called “Doing Almost Anything
with Text/HTML” earlier in this chapter for more details. The module
automatically displays Q. before the question so you don’t need to type
anything to indicate that it is the question.
3. Enter the answer into the RTE displayed below the Answer field.
As with the question field, you can insert any images, links, and so on, to
best illustrate the answer.
4. Click the Update link.
The question is now displayed on the page. Click on the question to
view the answer.
Figure 5-5:
The FAQs
module
displays
each
question as
a link. When
a user 
clicks on 
a question,

135
Chapter 5: Delivering Content Right Out of the Box

FAQs are displayed in the order that they are entered: The first FAQ you enter
is displayed at the top of the module, and the most recently entered is dis-
played last. Because there is no way of reordering FAQs, be sure to plan the
order in which you would like them to appear before adding them.
Editing an FAQ
The FAQ module uses one of the most common methods for editing modules
with multiple records. Here’s how to edit an FAQ:
1. Click the Edit button displayed to the left of the question to be edited.
This takes you to the Edit FAQs page.
2. Edit the question into the RTE displayed below the Question field.
3. Enter the answer into the RTE displayed below the Answer field.
4. Click the Update link.
The question is now displayed on the page. Click on the question to
view the answer.
To delete an FAQ, simply click the Delete link after Step 1.
Getting Around with Links
Links (short for hyperlinks) are the key to any Web site and one of the best
ways of accessing and reading documents. The use of links means that users
are no longer forced to skim through a full page of text to seek out relevant
information. Links can be added throughout the main text of a Web page (see
“Doing Almost Anything with Text/HTML” earlier in this chapter) or grouped
together in a list by using the Links module, as shown in Figure 5-6. Using the
Links module on a page to list one or more links allows you provide users
with one place to quickly find relevant topics to the current page, or draw
their attention to pages you want to promote.
The Links module uses a tool called Link Type. This tool is used throughout
DNN whenever you have the option to set a link. Any modules or Administration
pages that enable you to set a link use the Link Type tool. Examples of these
modules include the Announcements and Documents modules.
136
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

Adding a link to another Web site
Here’s how to add a link to another Web site by using the Links module:
1. Select Add Link from the module menu.
This displays the Edit Links page.
2. Enter a title for the link into the Title text box.
The title of the link is displayed on the page. For example, if you enter
Local Schools as the title, this is the text displayed on the page.
3. Ensure that URL (A Link to an External Resource) is selected as the
Link Type.
4. Enter the URL to the Web site you want to link to in the Location:
(Enter the Address of the Link) field.
For example, enter www.localschools.com to link to that Web site.
5. Enter a description of the link into the Description text box.
The description displays as a tooltip when the user hovers their mouse
pointer over the link title or when they click the ellipsis (. . .) after a link.
6. Check the Open Link In New Browser Window? check box if required.
This option allows you to set how the link will work. It is common prac-
tice when linking to another Web site to set the link to open a new
browser window to display the new site. This means the user will then
have two browser windows open: The original browser displays the
page where they clicked from, and the new one displays the Web site
they click to get to. This makes it easy for users to get back to your Web
site after they have browsed around the new Web site.
Figure 5-6:
The Links
module
displays a
list of links.
137
Chapter 5: Delivering Content Right Out of the Box

7. Click the Update link.
The link is now displayed in the Links module. Mouse over the link to
view the tooltip and click on the link to go the Web site.
The URL you enter at Step 4 can be to a Web site, a page on a Web site,
or a file on a Web site.
Linking to pages, files, or 
users within your site
As well as linking to another Web site, you can also link to a page, file, or user
on your Web site. (Depending on which module the Link Type control is being
used in, however, some of these options may not be available.) These options
show as radio buttons directly under the Title.
Here’s how to link to a page, file, or user on your Web site:
 Page (A Page on Your Site): This option displays a drop-down box
labeled Select a Web Page from Your Site, where you can view a list 
of all the pages on your site and select the one you want to link to.
 File (A File on Your Site): This option displays two drop-down boxes
that let you set the link to a file that has been uploaded to the File
Manager located on the Admin page. Select the File Location, which is
the folder where the file was placed, and then the File Name. This option
also allows you to upload a new file if you haven’t uploaded it already.
See “Selecting and uploading a file on the fly” later in this chapter for 
full details.
 User (A Member of Your Site): This option displays a text box labeled
Enter The Username of a Member of Your Site. This option displays the
profile of the user. Details displayed can include their name, address,
contact information, and preferences. See Manage Profile Properties
under Admin➪User Accounts to find out how to set the details that 
will be displayed.
Selecting and uploading a file on the fly
Just to make your life easier, the Link Type control allows you to upload a file
to the File Manager while you are setting the link. This is great because it
means your workflow isn’t interrupted. Here’s how to upload a file to the
Admin➪File Manager while you are adding a link to a file:
1. Ensure that File (A File on Your Site) is selected as the Link Type.
This displays the File Location and File Name drop-down boxes.
138
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

2. Select the folder to upload the file to from the File Location drop-
down box.
This lists all the folders within the Administrators File Manager that you
have been given Read Access to. You cannot add a new folder from here.
If you have also been given Write Access, you will see the Upload New
File link. If you are logged in as an Administrator, you will see all the fold-
ers and be able to write to them as well.
3. Click the Upload New File link.
This displays a Browse button and two new links.
4. Click the Browse button and locate and select the file from your 
computer.
This displays the filename in the text box to the left of the Browse button.
5. Click the Upload Selected File link.
This uploads the file to the File Manager and displays thefilename in a
drop-down box. If you want to upload more files, repeat Steps 3 through 5.
Tracking clicks on your links
The Link Type tool provides some simple tools to help you track the popular-
ity of your links. You can use this information to find out what people are
most interested in. These are the click tracking tools available when setting a
link by using the Link Type tool:
 Track Number Of Times This Link Is Clicked? Leave this option
selected (it is selected by default) to display information about this link
on the Edit screen of the module below any editable fields. It displays
the Tracking URL info for this link (that is, the URL for the link, the
number of times the link has been clicked on your Web site, and the 
last time the link was clicked).
Note: The page must be updated before the information is displayed.
 Log the User, Date, and Time for Every Link Click? Select this option 
to display two fields with Calendar links, and a Display link. Clicking
Display gives you a report of all the times the link has been clicked on
between the two selected dates.
Changing the layout of links
Each Links module has four different settings that Administrators can use to
change the way links are displayed for that module. By changing one or more
of these settings, you can achieve a variety of layouts and customize the
layout of each Links module to best suit the page you are designing. Here’s
how to change the layout of a Links module:
139
Chapter 5: Delivering Content Right Out of the Box

1. Select Settings from the Links module menu.
This takes you to the Module Settings page for this module.
2. Click the Maximize button beside Links Settings.
This displays the different settings available for this module.
3. Select either List or Dropdown as the Control Type setting.
Select List if you want to display all the links in a list. This is the default
setting. Select Dropdown if you want to the links to be displayed in a
drop-down box. Using Dropdown is a good way to save space on a page.
4. Select either Vertical or Horizontal as the List Display Format setting.
This setting only applies when List is selected as the Control Type. As
the options suggest, you can set the links to display Vertically down the
page, which is the default option, or Horizontally across the page. If you
choose to display links horizontally, make sure that the titles aren’t too
long to fit in the selected pane.
5. Select either Yes or No for the Display Info Link setting.
This setting changes the way the description of a link is handled. The
default option for this setting is No, which means the description of the
link is displayed when a user mouses over the link title. By setting this
option to Yes, an ellipsis (. . .) link is displayed beside each link title.
Clicking on the ellipsis displays the description below the link title.
6. Select an image as the Display Icon.
This setting lets you choose an image to be displayed beside each link.
The prettiest option is to choose a small image or icon.
7. Click Update to save the new settings.
The links now display differently in the module, depending on the set-
ting you selected. Go back and try it again with another combination.
You can’t break anything, so don’t worry!
Letting Everyone Know 
with Announcements
The Announcements module displays a list of items, each consisting of a text
title, the date the item was published, a rich text description, and an optional
link to read more about it, as shown in Figure 5-7. Typically this module is
used to briefly announce topical items. Write a catchy title and a brief
description to enable your Web site users to quickly scan through the 
items and decide if they want to read more about any of these topics.
140
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

Adding an announcement
Here’s how to add an announcement to the Announcements module:
1. Select Add New Announcement from the module menu.
This takes you to the Edit Announcements page.
2. Enter a title for the announcement into the Title text box.
The title of the announcement is displayed on the page. For example, if
you enter First Home Buyer Grant as the title, this is the text displayed
on the page.
3. Enter a description of the announcement into the Description text box.
The description is displayed in the module below the title. The descrip-
tion can include links, images, and all the usual RTE formatting options.
4. (Optional.) Select the Link Type.
Selecting a link for an announcement is optional. If you leave the Link
Type set to None, no link is added. See “Getting Around with Links” ear-
lier in this chapter for details on the other types of links you can set.
5. Click the Calendar link and select the Publish Date.
The date you select here will be displayed beside the announcement
title for this item and the announcement will not be displayed on the
Web site until that date. This means you can create announcements in
advance to ensure that your Web site information is always up-to-date.

141
Chapter 5: Delivering Content Right Out of the Box

6. (Optional.) Enter the position of the announcement into the View
Order text box.
This step is optional. Entering a number here sets the order of each
announcement. For example, enter 1 to make it the top announcement. If
you don’t enter a number here, the announcements are all given a zero
(0) and order themselves according to their publish date, with the most
recent publish date at the top of the module.
7. Click the Update link.
The announcement is now displayed in the Announcements module. The
current date is displayed beside the module title and a Read More . . .
link provides access to the link.
Setting the displayed announcements
Each Announcements module includes two settings that enable you to con-
trol which announcements are displayed based on their publish date.
Here’s how to set the displayed announcements:
1. Select Settings from the module menu of an Announcements module.
This takes you to the Module Settings page for this module.
2. Click the Maximize button beside Announcements Settings.
This displays the different settings available for this module.
3. Enter a number into the History (Days) text box.
The number controls how many days’ old displayed announcements can
be. For example, entering 3 displays announcements from today, yester-
day, and the day before. Any older announcements will not be displayed.
4. Check the Display Future Items check box if required.
Check this box to set this module to display announcements that have
not reached their publish date yet. This lets you use the module to
announce upcoming events in advance. Leaving this box unchecked
keeps future announcements hidden. This setting doesn’t affect the
History setting above.
5. Click the Update link.
The announcements module will now be displayed and any existing
announcements affected by your changes will be hidden or displayed
accordingly.

Listing Your Contacts
For many people, your Web site is the first place they come to find out about
your business. If they like what they see, you want to make it easy for them to
contact you. We find it really annoying when a Web site doesn’t provide you
with a way to contact anyone who actually works there. This is fine for multi-
nationals, but for most businesses, you want to encourage customers to
come to you. The Contacts module, shown in Figure 5-8, is a great way to give
visitors quick access to contact information. Alternatively, you can use the
module on pages that are only visible to your customers or your staff,
thereby limiting who can access the information.
Here’s how to add a contact to the Contacts module:
1. Select Add New Contact from the module menu.
This takes you to the Edit Contacts page.
2. Enter the person’s full name in the Name text box.
You can enter the person’s name however you like; for example title,
first name, last name; or last name, first name, and no title. For instance,
you could enter the name as either Mr. Luke Marshall, or as Marshall,
Luke. Keep in mind that the contacts will be listed in alphabetical order
based on the name you enter. The Name field is the only mandatory field
on this module, so you can choose what other information you want to
fill in for each contact.
3. Enter the person’s role within your business into the Role text box.
For example, Senior Accountant.
4. Enter the person’s e-mail address into the E-mail text box.

required.
Your first and last name is displayed in the Owner column for each docu-
ment you add. This setting lets you change the owner to any other user.
You may want to do this if you are loading a bunch of documents that
belong to other people. For example, if you are a Web site Administrator
and need to manage a list of documents for someone else, you would
change the Owner field to that person so that users of the module know
who to talk to about the document.
6. Set the Link by using the Link Type control.
See “Getting Around with Links” for details on the types of links you 
can set.
7. Click the Update link.

mation such as the Owner (your name), the date the document record
was last updated, and the size of the document will also be displayed.
Click on the document title to view the document in a Web browser, or
click the Download link to download it to your computer.
If the document is located on an external resource, the size of the document
will be displayed as Unknown.
Sneaking a Peek with IFrame
The IFrame module can frame either a page from another Web site or a file
within your Web site inside a page on your site, as shown in Figure 5-10. In
other words, the IFrame module displays a page from another Web site on a
page of your Web site. If the IFrame frames a Web site page, that page still has
all of its functionality intact, so you can navigate around the Web site all from
the armchair comfort of your own Web page.
145

T
here are a lot of sites out there on the World Wide Web today. We haven’t
quite managed to count them all, but there are millions! Standing out
among the crowd can sometimes be difficult. Luckily the modules included
with DNN let you add some special touches to your Web site.
The modules covered in this chapter offer interesting, attractive, and useful
ways to do it. This chapter shows you how to use seven modules that are
included with DNN. These modules require a small amount of configuration
but aren’t at all complicated.
The Events and User Defined Tables modules present content in an interest
and interactive layout. The News Feeds module and XML/XML modules dis-
play data created outside of DNN. The Survey module lets you create online
surveys, and the UsersOnline module displays information and statistics on
your user membership. Read on to find out how to make your Web site stand
out with these great modules.
This chapter also explains how to add vendor accounts to your Web site.
Vendors are companies that have advertising banners or messages on your
Web site. The Administrator manages the vendor account, the uploading of
banners, and has access to banner reports.

Keeping Track of Dates 
with the Events Module
The Events module displays a list of events in a monthly calendar, as shown
in Figure 6-1. Users can click through different months, go to events for any
day, or view a list of all events for any given day.
This module has a large number of settings on the Module Settings page that
provide you with ways to make your Events module more interactive, or you
can let your users choose to be notified of events or to enroll for events.
These settings are out of the scope of this book.
Setting up the events calendar
You have to update the module settings page of the Events module before
you can see the event calendar inside the module. You can do this simply by
going to the page and clicking Update; however, it is a good idea to set the
General Settings at this point.
Here’s how to set the general settings of the Events module:
Figure 6-1:

Subscribing to News Feeds
The News Feeds module enables you to easily display content from other
Web sites on your Web site. The News Feeds module uses Really Simple
Syndication (RSS), which lets you display news that is syndicated by another
Web site. Such Web sites supply a URL that is entered into the News Feeds
module to displays their news. This is a great way of displaying instant con-
tent without writing a word!
If this module is not installed, see Chapter 3 for more on how to install
included modules.
Displaying a news feed
A news feed typically consists of a summary of news items, as shown in
Figure 6-4. Each item has a link to read more about that news item. Clicking
on the link takes the visitor away from your Web site and to the Web site 
providing the news service.
Here’s how to display a news feed in the News Feeds module:
1. Select Edit News Feed from the News Feeds module menu.
This takes you to the Edit News Feeds screen.
2. Select URL (A Link to an External Resource) as the Link Type for the
News Feed Source field.
This displays the Location: (Enter The Address Of The Link) field.
3. Enter the URL of the news feed into the Location: (Enter the Address
of the Link) text box.
In this example, we use the free Latin American and Canadian News 
from World Press Review. The URL is www.worldpress.org/feeds/
americas.xml. Look for news feeds that display the commonly used
little orange XML button beside them as this indicates that the feed will
work in this module.
4. If a style sheet is required, set the Link Type to the required style
sheet at the News Feed Style Sheet field.
Some news feeds require you to set a style sheet here so that the news
feed displays correctly on the Web page. If this is the case, you can get
the link to the style sheet file or download the style sheet file from the
news feed service.
If you are using our sample URL, you won’t need to do this step.
158
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

5. Click the Update link.
The news feed is now displayed on your Web page. Click on a link to see
how the news feed works. Note: The link will open inside the same Web
browser.
Subscribing to a news feed
News feeds are available on every topic you can imagine. When we did a
Google search on “free news feeds” at the time of writing, we got more than
50,000 results! If, on the other hand, you choose to subscribe to a paid news
feed service, the News Feeds module includes security options that allow you
to enter your account information for the paid service.
Here’s how to set the security options on a news feed:
1. Select Edit News Feed from the News Feeds module menu.
This takes you to the Edit News Feeds screen.
2. Add the news feed.
Set the details of the news feed as described in Steps 2 through 4 in the
preceding section.

4. Click the Update link.
The news feed is now displayed on your Web page. Click on a link to see
how the news feed works. Note: The link will open inside the same Web
browser.
Going Ad Hoc with the User 
Defined Table Module
The User Defined Table (UDT) module provides Administrators with the ability
to design and populate a table of information, as shown in Figure 6-5. Using this
module is a great alternative to the Table tool provided in the RTE because you
can design and manage the table separately from its content. Columns are set
to enable one of these types of information to be entered or selected: Text,
Rich Text (HTML), Integer, Decimal, Date and Time, Date, Time, True/False,
Email, Currency, URL, Image, file Download, or a Calculated Column.
After the table is designed, you can add one or more rows of information into
the table, similar to the way you add a row of information to the Contacts
module or the Documents module.
If this module is not installed, see Chapter 3 for more on installing the
included modules.
Building a UDT table
Here’s how to build a table in the UDT module:
1. Select Manage User Defined Table from the module menu.
Figure 6-5:
A table

User Defined
Table
module.
160
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

This takes you to the Manage User Defined Table page, shown in Figure 6-6,
where you can build and edit the table design. The page displays an area
where you can add columns to the table, as well as Global Settings and
Display Settings, which set the way information is displayed in the table.
Four existing table columns are displayed at the top of this page. These
columns cannot be deleted but they are not displayed in the UDT unless
you set them as Visible.
2. Click the Add New Column link.
This creates a row of text boxes where you can enter values for this
column.
3. Check the Required box if this row is mandatory.
Mandatory fields must be filled in when entering data into the table. If
you don’t check this option, the field will be optional.
4. Enter a unique column title in the Title text box.
The title is displayed at the top of this column when the table is saved.
5. Select the type of information that will be entered into this column
into the Type text box.
There are 14 different options to select from, including Text, Decimal,
Date, Time, and so on. Choose the type that reflects the information you
plan to add to this column.

Chapter 6: Adding Bells and Whistles to Your Site

Avoid the Calculated Column field if you can. It requires some pro-
gramming to make it work. If you want to find out more about this
option, visit the Project page of the User Defined Table Module on 
the DNN Web site (www.dotnetnuke.com/DotNetNukeProjects/
ModuleUserDefinedTable/tabid/877/Default.aspx). Click the
Project Downloads link and download the User Manual, which has more
information on this field.
6. (Optional.) Enter the default information for this column in the
Default text box.
The information entered here is displayed in this column when you are
entering data into the table later. You can delete or change the default
value at any time.
Do not enter a default value for a Download type field as it will cause an
error. If you do choose to enter a default value for other types, make
sure that it is the right value for the field type. For example, if the field
type is set to Date, you can only enter a date in the Default field.
Entering text, such as “Enter a date here,” will cause an error.
Here are examples of default values for each column type:
• Text: Enter any text. For example, Enter your text here.
• Rich Text (HTML): Enter any text or HTML. For example, <b>Enter
a short description here</b>.
• Integer: Enter any whole number. For example, 1129.
• Decimal: Enter any decimal number. For example, 1129.11.
• E-mail: Enter an e-mail address here. For example, Jessie.
Saide@domain.com.
• Date and Time: Enter a date and/or time. For example, 01/01/2007
09:00 AM.
• Date: Enter a date. For example, 01/01/2007 09:00 AM.
• Time: Enter a time. For example, 09:00 AM.
• True/False: Enter either true or false to display either a selected or
unselected check box, respectively. For example, True.
• Currency: Enter a currency amount. For example, 80.00.Currency
type will automatically be displayed in each row. See Chapter 4 to
find out how to update this setting.
• URL: Enter a URL. For example, www.dotnetnuke.com.
• Image: Enter a URL to an image. For example,
www.dotnetnuke.com/Portals/_default/Skins/
DNN-Minimal/images/dotnetnukelogo.gif.
• Download: Do not enter a default value as it will cause an error.
This field enables an uploaded file to be downloaded.

7. Click the Save button to the left of this row of text boxes to save the
column.
The column is now saved and displayed on the page.
8. Repeat Steps 2 through 7 to add additional columns.
9. Click the Save Settings and Return link to return to the Web page.
Do not change the Type setting on a column as this will display a Warning
message and may require you to rebuild your table. Be sure to design and
build your table before you start adding information (rows) to it.
Adding data to a UDT table
The first couple of times you enter data into the table, you may want to have
a piece of paper with the structure of the table written down to remind you
what type of information needs to entered into each column. This depends
on how big your table is, how many different information types you are using,
and how self-explanatory the titles of the columns are.
Here’s how to add data to a UDT table:
1. Select Add New Row from the module menu.
This opens the Edit User Defined Table page shown in Figure 6-7. 
The first four lines of information (CreatedBy, CreatedAt, ChangedBy,
ChangedAt) are automatically recorded when you save the data for 
this row. You can see this information each time you edit this row.
2. Enter data into each field.
Required fields are denoted by an asterisk (*) and must be completed.
Usually you can guess the types of data permitted by the type of text
field displayed beside the column title. For example, if the Link Type tool
is displayed for the field and only displays images, you can guess that it
is an image data field.
Number and decimal fields display entered values in the right side of the
field, whereas text fields display data to the left of the field.
3. Click the Update link to save the data.
This returns you to your Web page. If the wrong type of information has
been entered into a field, you will remain on the Edit User Defined Table
page. In this case, an error message is displayed at the top of the page

Sharing Spreadsheets and 
Data with XML/XSL
The XML/XSL module, shown in Figure 6-8, enables the data within an XML
file to display on a Web page by applying an XSL style sheet to it. Although
we’ve been building Web sites by using DNN for several years, we still find
the title of this module a bit intimidating. Never fear! You can use this module
even if, like us, you don’t really understand XML or XSL.
So what are XML and XSL, you ask? XML stands for eXtensible Markup
Language, which may sound a bit confusing. Any search on the Web will give
you a detailed explanation of XML, but, in a nutshell, XML is like HTML in that
it is a computer language that marks up text with special tags. The difference
between the two technologies is that HTML uses the same tags to mark up
the text, whereas XML creates unique tags to mark up the text, depending on
the type of data you are saving.
XSL is an acronym for eXtensible Stylesheet Language. For this module, XSL
or XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) refers to a style
sheet designed to transform an XML file into HTML so it can be displayed 
on a Web page. Without the XSL file, the data doesn’t display correctly on 
the Web page.

Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

To summarize, you need an XML file with a matching XSL file to display data
by using this module. If you don’t know how to create an XSL file, you either
need to find out how to write one or get someone else to write one for you.
Creating an XML file from an
Excel spreadsheet
Many different programs can be used to create XML files. In this example, we
use Excel to create an XML file. Here’s how to transform an Excel spreadsheet
into an XML file:
1. Create an Excel spreadsheet, enter your data, and save the file.
You may want to download our sample Excel spreadsheet from
http://dnnrealty.com/ForSellers/tabid/214/Default.aspx
to use for this example.
2. Select File➪Save As from the Main menu.
This opens the Save As dialog box.
3. Navigate to the location where you want to save the XML file.
Figure 6-8:

XML/XSL
module.
165
Chapter 6: Adding Bells and Whistles to Your Site

4. Select XML Spreadsheet (*.xml) from the Save As Type drop-down box
and then click the Save button.
This saves the Excel spreadsheet as an XML file.
Displaying a custom spreadsheet 
from Excel
To display an Excel spreadsheet on your Web site, you must first save it as an
XML file as we discussed in the preceding section. You must also have an XSL
file (style sheet) that has been created to match the data in the XML file. If
you don’t have an XSL file, the XML data may not display correctly. You can
download our sample XML and XSL files from http://dnnrealty.com/
ForSellers/tabid/214/Default.aspx to use in this example, if you like.
Here’s how to display an Excel spreadsheet on your Web page:
1. Select Edit XML/XSL Options from the module menu.
This takes you to the Edit XML/XSL page.
2. Select or enter the XML file by using the Link Type tool displayed for
the XML Data File field.
See Chapter 4 for more details on using the link type tool.
3. Select or enter the XSL file by using the Link Type tool displayed for
the XSL Transformations File field.
It is called a transformation file because it transforms the XML data into
something readable on the Web site. If you don’t select an XSL file here,
the XML data will not display correctly.
4. Click the Update link.
Your XML data is now displayed on the Web page.
Creating online surveys
The Survey module enables you to create an online survey consisting of one
or more questions with answers, as shown in Figure 6-9. The Survey module
enables users to submit their answers once and to view survey results dis-
played in an attractive bar graph.
This module is popular with users who want to add their two cents or see
what others have to say. You can also use this module as a pop quiz, meaning
that the questions can have correct and incorrect answers, instead of just
using it to gather opinions. The results can also be kept private.
166
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

Creating a survey
Here’s how to create a survey by adding questions to the Survey module:
1. Select Add Question from the module menu.
This takes you to the Create Survey page.
2. Enter a question into the Question text box.
For example, Who is the fairest of them all?
3. Select the type of answer that can be given to the question from the
Type drop-down selection box.
There are two types of questions you can add. The Single Selection
option permits survey respondents to select only one answer by using
radio buttons. The Multiple Selection option permits survey respon-
dents to select multiple answers by using check boxes.
4. If this survey contains more than one question, enter the question
number here.
This sets the order of questions. For example, enter 5 to make this the
fifth question in the survey.
5. Enter an answer option for the question into the New Option text box.
For example, Snow White.
Figure 6-9:

167
Chapter 6: Adding Bells and Whistles to Your Site

6. (Optional.) Select the check box at Option Is Correct Answer? If
required.
If the option entered at Step 5 is the correct answer to the question, 
you can denote this here. Don’t select this option if there is no correct
answer, or you don’t want to share the correct answer. Questions can
have more than one correct answer.
7. Click the Add Option link to save the answer option.
The option is displayed in the Options list on this page. Options that are
set as correct are displayed like this: >Correct Answer<.
8. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to add additional options.
This adds other answer options to this question. Each additional answer
option added is displayed in the Options list below.
9. Click the Update link to save this question and answer options.
This takes you back to the survey page, where this question is now 
displayed.
10. Repeat Steps 1 through 9 to add additional questions and answers to
the survey.
After you have finished adding questions, your survey is ready for
people to start submitting answers. You might like to keep your survey
visible only to Administrators while you are in the process of building it
to prevent people from submitting answers when it is half-built.
The Create Survey screen displays a check box titled Option Is Correct
Answer?. By checking this when creating one or more options for a question,
you can use the survey as a multiple-choice questionnaire or as a pop quiz.
Settings to enhance your survey
Here are three optional settings to customize a survey:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This takes you to the Module Settings page.
2. Click the Maximize button beside Survey Settings.
This displays the four settings you can modify for this survey module.
3. Click the Calendar link and select the last date for survey responses
into the Survey Closing Date field.
By selecting a date here, you close the survey from further responses at
the end of that day. The next day, the Submit Survey link that enables
168
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

responses to be recorded will be removed from the page, thus prevent-
ing any more answers from being submitted. The results to date are dis-
played to those authorized to view them.
4. Enter a pixel value to set the maximum width for the bar graph into
the Maximum Bar Graph Width text box (for example, 200).
The bar graph set to 200 pixels is shown in Figure 6-10. When this setting
is left blank, the width of the bar graph is 100% of the pane. This doesn’t
always look right, especially for a small survey with only a couple of
short questions. Setting the width is a good way to establish the impor-
tance of the survey to your visitors.
5. Select an option to set how the survey results are controlled in the
Vote Tracking field.
Selecting Vote Tracking Via Cookie saves a cookie to a person’s com-
puter, preventing them from submitting the survey more than once.
Selecting 1 Vote/Registered User allows registered users to submit
results only once.
6. Select either Public or Private at the Survey Results field to set access
to survey results.
Selecting Public permits everyone with View Module permissions to
view the survey results. If Private is selected, only Administrators can
view the results.
7. Click the Update link.
This takes you back to the survey page and the question is displayed.

Leveraging Partnerships with Banners
The Banners module displays advertising for other companies, which DNN
calls vendors. You are in control of the management of both vendor accounts
and their advertising banners. For example, if another company sells comple-
mentary products to that of your company, you may choose to give free
advertising to each other on your respective Web sites. Alternatively, if your
Web site has lots of traffic, you may want to sell advertising space to other
companies as a revenue raiser.
To use the Banners module, you must have vendors with banners. To do this,
you must first create accounts for your vendors. After you have created
vendor accounts, which are completely separate from your user accounts,
you can create advertising banners for them. When that is done, you can set
the Banners module to display these banners.
Creating a vendor account
DNN manages two separate vendor directories. One is located under Admin➪
Vendors, which is maintained by Administrators, and the other is under Host➪
Vendors, which is maintained by the host. Site banners are only available for
display on this particular Web site, whereas host banners are available for
display on all Web sites in this DNN installation.
Here’s how to add a vendor to the Admin➪Vendors page:
1. Select Admin➪Vendors from the site menu.
This takes you to the Vendors page, where you can view existing vendor
accounts.
2. Select Add New Vendor from module menu.
This takes you to the Edit Vendor page, shown in Figure 6-11, where you
can add new vendor accounts.
3. Complete all fields in the Vendor Details section.
All fields are mandatory.
4. Complete all required fields in the Address Details section.
An asterisk indicates required fields. You can change any address field
from required to optional by deselecting the check box beside it. These
settings are then saved for the next time you are adding or editing a
vendor account. The Other Details fields are optional.
170
Part II: Putting the Power of DotNetNuke to Work 

5. (Optional.) Enter the vendor’s Web site URL into the Web Site text box
in the Other Details section.
6. Click the Update link to save the new vendor.
You are now back on the Vendors page and the vendor you added is 
displayed. You can now add banners to this vendor.
Adding an image banner to a vendor

7. Select the type of banner from the Banner Type drop-down box, for
example, Banner.
The first five options (Banner, MicroButton, Button, Block, and
Skyscraper) denote different sizes of image banners. Categorizing ban-
ners by sizes helps you design and control the layout of your pages. For
example, you should place banners that are the Banner sizes in the
Content Pane as they are wide. The other types of images look best in
the side pane because they are long and skinny.
8. (Optional.) Enter a word or phrase into the text box at Banner Group.
This text helps you define banners that you want to group together. The
group can be just for one vendor, or for more than one vendor. When
you want to identify banners as belonging to the same group, enter that
name into this field. When you set up the Banners module, you can then
enter this text and set the module to only display banners belonging to
this Banner Group name.
9. Select the image by using the Link Type tool displayed for the
Image/Link field.
10. (Optional.) Enter the pixel width for the banner into the text box of
the Width field.
This sets the width of the image. Leave this field blank to display the
original image width.
11. (Optional.) Enter the pixel height for the banner into the text box of
the Width field.

A
fter you have created a Web site by using the modules covered in
Chapters 5 and 6, you’re ready to tackle some of the more interactive
modules that let people get involved with your site, have their say, and hear
what others have to say.
The best Web sites have something new and interesting to read or do each
time you visit them. An out-of-date Web site is a bit like visiting good old Uncle
Bill: Everyone loves his storytelling, but he’s told the same story the last ten
times you’ve visited. But unless you’re planning to dedicate your days and
nights to writing new content, you need to enlist the help of people with
knowledge and interest in topics relevant to your site. Who could be a better
helper than your site’s users? Everyone likes to have their say, so letting users
contribute to your site gives them a sense of belonging to the community, as
well as stimulating interest and debate. In return, you get free content, find out
what’s topical, and end up with more site content as a result.
Getting to Know the Feedback Modules
The simplest way to find out what people want from your site is by encourag-
ing them to tell you. DNN comes with a feedback system of two modules that
receive and share user feedback.

The first module, shown in Figure 7-1, is called the Feedback module and it
enables users to send a message to the Administrator. This module is great
because it allows you to receive feedback without revealing your e-mail
address on the site, and it’s very easy to use. This module can be used either
by itself or with the Feedback Comments module. The Feedback Comments
module, also shown in Figure 7-1, displays details of the feedback you have
received.
Receiving feedback in a flash
The Feedback module doesn’t require any setup; you just add it to a page the
same way you added the modules from Chapters 5 and 6. It works like a form:
Users enter the details and click Send. To use the Feedback module, you
simply need to add it to a page.
All roles that can view the module are able to send feedback, so you don’t
have to give users module edit permissions.
The Administrator who receives the feedback is the person specified under
Advanced Settings on the Admin➪Site Settings page.
Sending feedback
After you’ve added the Feedback module to a page, visitors to your Web site
can use it to send messages to the Administrator. The user just completes the
blank fields and clicks Send. Help buttons are displayed to everyone, making
the form simple to complete.

184
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

To send feedback to the Administrator, users just need to complete these
steps:
1. Complete all fields.
Users don’t need to register or log in to send feedback, but if they are
logged in, the name and e-mail fields are prefilled for them.
2. If you don’t want a copy of the feedback sent to you, deselect Send
Copy. The Send Copy option can be set in the Settings of the module
to show or not show.
This option sends a copy of the feedback message to the e-mail address
given.
3. Click Send.
A confirmation message is displayed telling the sender whether the feed-
back was sent successfully.
Your host needs to enable your site to send messages. You can test if this has
been set up by sending a test message to yourself.
Sharing the feedback workload
If your visitors have a lot to say, you might find yourself answering oodles of
e-mails and not doing much else. To lighten the workload, you can add more
than one Feedback module to your site and set them to send the feedback to
different people. For example, you could add one Feedback module on a Sales
Enquiry page that sends e-mail to your sales team, and another Feedback
module on the Contact Us page that sends to your main contact person.
Here’s how you can set a Feedback module to send messages to an e-mail
address other than the Administrator:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
2. Expand the Feedback Settings section.
3. Enter the e-mail address to which you want the feedback to be sent in
the Send To field.
The e-mail address you add here will receive feedback from this module
now. The Administrator will no longer receive e-mails.
If you want the feedback to go to more than one person, create a 
distribution list by using your e-mail program, such as Microsoft
Outlook. (Check the help system of your e-mail program on how to
create a distribution list.) For example, you can create a distribution list
called salesteam@domain.com that forwards any e-mails send to this
address to all your sales team members. Simply enter the distribution
list e-mail address into the Send To field.
185
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

4. Click Update.
This module is now set to send all feedback to the set e-mail address.
Sharing and moderating 
feedback comments
The Feedback Comments module lets you share feedback comments with
others. If the feedback you’re getting is all good, you will want to share it with
everyone. If it’s all bad, you should probably only share it with your staff! If
it’s some good and some bad, which is probably the most likely scenario, you
can use moderation to choose what feedback you share and what you don’t.
Either way, you have full control over who sees what comments.
Here’s how to share feedback comments with others:
1. Add the Feedback module to a page.
2. Select Settings from the Feedback Comments module menu.
This will take you to the Module Settings page.
3. At Permissions to View Module, select each of the security roles that
can view comments.
You will need to deselect the Inherit View Permissions check box to do
this.
4. Click Update.
The Feedback Comments module is now displayed to only the roles you
selected. If you are happy for these users to see all feedback comments,
you can skip these last steps, which add moderation to the module.
5. Select Settings from the Feedback module menu.
6. Select Moderated.
This sets the module to send a notification e-mail to the Administrator,
or the address entered in the Send To field, whenever feedback is
received. The e-mail includes a link to the feedback where the
Administrator can choose to approve or delete the feedback.
7. Click Update.
Your Feedback Comments module is now ready to share comments with
others.

Modifying the layout and fields 
of the Feedback module
The Feedback module has a number of settings that alter the fields displayed
on the module and affect how it works. Here’s how to change the standard
Feedback module:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
2. Expand the Feedback Settings section below.
3. Enter the width (in number of pixels) for the message box in the
Width field.
This lets you make the message box wider. The standard size of the 
message field is 150 pixels.
4. Enter the number of lines long you want the Message box to be in the
Rows field.
This lets you make the message box longer. The standard number of
rows for the message field is ten lines.
These two settings only control how big the message box is, not the
length of the message your user can enter.
5. Select the Send Copy field to send the user a copy of their feedback.
If this option is selected, the user is e-mailed a copy of their feedback
message. Users generally like to receive a copy of their feedback as it
confirms that the message was successfully sent and lets them review
their comments. Skip to Step 7 if you did not select this option.
6. Select Optout to give users the option to opt out of receiving feedback.
If this option is selected, a Send Copy selection box is displayed to the
user on the Feedback module. This gives users the option to choose
whether to receive a copy of their feedback.
7. Enter a Subject for the feedback.
This will be the subject used in any e-mail notifications. The subject will
also be displayed in the Feedback Comments module. Skip to Step 9 if
you did not select this option.
8. Select Can Select Subject to give users the option to edit your subject
or add their own.
If this option is selected, the Subject field is displayed on the Feedback
module. If you added a subject at Step 7, users will be able to modify it.
If you didn’t add a subject, users can enter their own.
187
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

9. If you don’t want to be notified when feedback is received, deselect
the Notify option.
The notify option is selected by default so you know when feedback is
received. If you deselect this option, you must have the Feedback
Comments module displayed so any feedback is captured.
10. Click Update.
The feedback module is now displayed with your new settings.
There is the option to add categories to Feedback modules and display 
a different category of feedback in different Feedback Comment modules.
Unfortunately, categories can only be added by your host.
Getting Familiar with This 
Blogging Business
Since the late 1990s, one of the fastest growing areas of the Internet has been
blogging. A blog (short for Weblog) is a personal online journal or diary
where a blogger (a person who keeps a blog) shares their thoughts, ideas,
knowledge (or lack thereof), and anything else they have to say. Blogs are
written in a personal and informal way, so it’s kind of like peeking at some-
one’s diary — without the guilt.
Virtually everyone is blogging these days, including celebrities. Check out
Moby’s popular blog at www.moby.com/journal, or Shaun Walker’s at
www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/BlogsDotNetNuke/tabid/825/
BlogID/1/Default.aspx. (Shaun Walker is the inventor of DotNetNuke.)
Blogging isn’t just for celebrities. Individuals who know a lot about a particu-
lar subject also attract a huge following. Check out this techie blog from
Robert Scoble: http://scobleizer.com/.
Getting to know the DNN Blog module
DNN includes a Blog module, which enables you manage one or more blogs
for one or more people. Start by adding a Blog module to a page (like we did
in Chapters 5 and 6) and looking at it. The first thing you notice is that it isn’t
really a single module, but five modules that work together, as shown in
Figure 7-2. I discuss these five modules in the upcoming sections.
188
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Most Recent Blog Entries
The Most Recent Blog Entries module is the main blog module that displays
blog entries. When you first add the module, the title reads Most Recent Blog
Entries; however, the module title changes depending on what entries are
being displayed.
The Most Recent Blog Entries module displays the most recent entries from
all public blogs by default. It can display a single blog if the user selects one
from the Blog List module or clicks the Go to My Blog link on the New Blog
module. This changes the module title to the name of the selected blog. The
module also displays search results for the Search Blog module. Performing a
search changes the module title to Search Results.
This module has an Administration page called Module Options located on
the module menu. Here you can change the layout of blogs in this module
and manage settings to enable bloggers to add attachments and images to
their entries. (See “Setting Options for the Most Recent Blog Entries Module”
later in this chapter for more information on these settings.)
Blog Archive
The Blog Archive module displays a monthly calendar where any days with a
blog entry are highlighted. Click on a highlighted day to view entries for that
day. Below the calendar is a list of all months that have an entry. Clicking on a
month displays all entries for that month in the Most Recent Blog Entries
module.
Figure 7-2:
The Blog
modules.
189
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

New Blog
The New Blog module gives authorized users the ability to add one or more
blogs. After a user has added their first blog, the module displays links
enabling them to add entries, change the settings applied to their blog, and
go to their blog. Users can also create child blogs of their main blog, enabling
them to create different blogs for different information.
This module provides access to the Edit Blog Settings page. This page
enables users to manage the settings for each of their blogs. Settings include
the title and description of the blog, blog options such as commenting and
trackback, syndication, date settings management, and the ability to create
child blogs.
A message that reads “You must be logged in and have permission to create
or edit a blog” is displayed to unauthenticated users. If you don’t want users
to see this warning message, change the permissions for View Module to
Registered Users only. This means the module won’t show until people log in.
All roles that have permission to edit this module (under Module Settings)
can create one or more blogs. Restrict who can create a blog by setting the
Edit Module permissions accordingly. You can do this by clicking Settings
from the module menu and then ticking the check boxes for the roles that
you want to be able to create a blog.
Blog List
The Blog List module lists all public blogs on the site. Click on a blog to view
it in the Most Recent Blog Entries module and to access the Edit Blog Settings
page for that blog via the module menu.
Search Blog
The Search Blog module lets users search the title and content of public
blogs by keywords or phrase. They can choose to search All Blogs, or select
a parent blog from the drop-down list. Searching a parent blog also searches
any child blogs it has.
This module doesn’t have an Administration page, but there are three search-
related settings on the Most Recent Blog Entries module. (See the section
“Setting Options for the Most Recent Blog Entries Module” later in this chap-
ter for more.)
Creating a public blog
Start by setting up your blog:
190
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

1. Click Create My Blog on the New Blog module.
This takes you to the Create New Blog page.
2. In the Title and Description fields, enter a title and description for
your blog, as shown in Figure 7-3.
The description is displayed on your blog. It should accurately describe
your blog’s content so that users know what to expect.
3. Under Blog Options, select the Make This Blog Public check box.
If you don’t select this option, the blog is private, meaning only you can
see it.
4. Click Update.
After you have created your blog, you may notice the following changes:
 Your blog is listed in the Blog List and in the Search module.
 The description is displayed on the Most Recent Blog Entries module.
Figure 7-3:
Creating a
public blog.
191
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

Creating child blogs
If you have a lot to say, you can create more than just one blog for yourself.
For example, you might like to have one for your friends and family, as well as
one for work stuff. Your first blog is known as your parent blog; all of your
additional blogs are known as child blogs. Each child blog you create is listed
and indented below the parent blog.
1. Click Blog Settings on the New Blog module, which takes you to 
the Edit Blog page.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the Edit Blog page.
3. Click the Add button beside the Child Blogs field.
This takes you to the Create New Child Blog page. This page looks just
like the last page, so don’t worry if nothing seems to change.
4. Complete all the fields, just as you did when you created your 
first blog.
5. Click Add.
The child blog is now listed in the Child Blog field. You can also edit or
delete Child Blogs from here.
6. Click Update.
Making blog entries
The best blogs are ones that are updated frequently or even daily, so don’t be
shy about sharing your thoughts. Here’s how to add your first blog entry:
1. Click Add Blog Entry on the New Blog module.
The date and time will be shown in the Entry Date field. You can change
the date of your entry by editing it here, but you need to keep to the
same format.
Note: The date format can be changed under Blog Settings. (See “Setting
date and time options” for more on date formats.)
2. Select the parent blog.
This enables you to choose which of your blogs you want to add the
entry to. If you don’t have any child blogs, you don’t need to select any-
thing here.
192
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

3. Add your entry.
Enter the title and the blog. The Description field is optional as one is
created from the first few lines of the blog if you don’t enter one.
Note: The Description field can be made mandatory (See “Blog Settings
for All Bloggers: Advanced Settings for Your Blog” to find out how to set
this field as mandatory.)
4. Set the entry options.
If you select the Copyright Notice option, wait a moment while a new
field is displayed. This shows the standard copyright notice. You can
edit the notice, but it won’t save your edits for next time. The standard
message is Copyright (c)2006, followed by either your username or your
first and last name (for example, Copyright (c)2006 John Black). (See
“Blog Settings for All Bloggers: Advanced Settings for Your Blog” later in
this chapter for more on the settings available here.)
See the section “Using trackback URLs” later in this chapter for more 
on the entry options.
5. Click Update.
Congratulations, you are now a blogger!
Viewing, editing, or deleting blog entries
Here’s how to edit or delete a blog entry:
1. Click View My Blog on the New Blog module.
Your blog is now displayed in the Most Recent Blog Entries module.
2. Click the entry title or the More link.
The entry will now be displayed.
3. Click the Edit Entry link to edit or delete the entry, or change the
parent or child blog that it is listed under. Perform any of the follow-
ing steps to do this:
• To edit the blog, change the text and click Update below the editor.
• To delete the blog, click the Delete link below the editor.
• To change the parent blog, select the blog name from the Parent
Blog list above the editor and click Update below.

Setting Options for the Most 
Recent Blog Entries Module
The Most Recent Blog Entries module has a number of settings that control
the presentation of blogs in the module, such as how many recent entries are
displayed, the length of the blog summary, and so on. This section also
includes miscellaneous settings, such as those that allow bloggers to upload
images and enable the module to display only one blog.
To access the Administrator settings of the Most Recent Blog Entries module,
select Module Options from the menu of the Most Recent Blog Entries
module. The Module Options page is displayed, as shown in Figure 7-4.
Most fields are sufficiently explained under their respective help icons, so, in
the next sections, we just cover the trickier ones.
Allow bloggers to add images 
and attachments
The Allow Upload Options check box enables bloggers to upload images and
attachments while adding an entry. Uploaded images are displayed in the
Rich Text Editor (RTE) and attachments are added as a link to the RTE. The
Figure 7-4:
The Module
Options
page lets
you change
the layout of
the blog 
and allow
bloggers to
upload
images.
194
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Module Options page also has a setting called Limit Upload Image Width To,
where you can set the maximum pixel width for images. This doesn’t prevent
users from adding an image that exceeds the maximum; it just resizes it as it
is added to the Rich Text Editor.
Setting a personal blog page
The Personal Blog Page drop-down list lets you choose a parent blog for this
page. When you select one, the other blogs are no longer displayed on the
site unless you add another Most Recent Blog Entries module to the page.
This lets you display a different blog on different pages.
Search options
The Limit Search Summary To field lets you limit the length of the entry 
summaries in your search results to ensure quick and short results.
The Enable DNN Search option lets you enable the DNN search. Doing this
means that your blog entries are also searchable from the DNN Search
system.
Don’t enable DNN search for more than one Most Recent Blog Entries module
on your site: It will create duplicate results.
Show Blog Summary
This shows a summary above the entry. If the summary field is not manda-
tory, this information is a repeat of the beginning of the blog and therefore
not of much use.
Blog Settings for All Bloggers: Advanced
Settings for Your Blog
You may have noticed that we skipped a bucketload of settings when we cre-
ated your first blog. These settings are available to the blogger for their own
blog. Now take a moment to go back and look at these settings.
195
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

Select Edit Blog Settings from the Blog List module menu, or select Blog
Settings from the New Blog module. This takes you to the Edit Blog page. If
you want to edit the settings for a child blog, scroll down to the Child Blog
field and click the Edit button to edit it now. This gives you these same
options:
 Public or private blog: The Make This Blog Public option controls the
visibility of your blog to others. Public blogs can be viewed by everyone
authorized to see the Most Recent Blog Entries module. If you deselect
this option, your blog won’t be listed in the Most Recent Blog Entries
module under Most Recent Blog Entries; it won’t be listed in the Blog
List module; and it won’t be included in search results. In this case, you
need to use the New Blog module to view your blog.
 Let people add comments to entries: You can enable people to add a
comment to entries. This adds a comment box below each entry. If you
set the blog to require approval for comments, the comments are not
displayed until they are approved.
Here are your options for comment settings:
• Allow Users to Post Comments: Enables comments to be added to
posts.
• Approval for User Comments Required: Select this option if you
want to approve user comments before they appear online. This
gives you the chance to read the comment and either approve,
edit, or delete it.
• Let Anonymous Users to Comment: Select this option if you want
to let unauthenticated users post comments. If this option is dese-
lected, users must be logged in to post comments.
• Approval for Anonymous Comments Required: Select this option
if you want to approve anonymous comments before they appear
online.
• Send Mail Notification After Comments and Trackbacks Are
Posted: If you have set approval for any comments (or track-
backs), this option lets you receive e-mail notification. If you don’t
select this option, you need to open each entry to see if it has a
comment requiring approval, which is time consuming.
If comments are disabled, the blogger can override this setting for an individ-
ual entry when they are adding it by ticking the Allow users to comment on
this entry (overrides Blog Setting) option.
196
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Setting date and time options
This setting enables bloggers to display their own time and date information.
This means that if you add a post from Australia to a site in the United States,
when you’re adding it, you see the Aussie time and date rather than those of
the site.
At the time of this writing, changing the time zone resets the date format field
to standard U.S. format such as 1/20/2007. Get around this by setting the time
zone before the date.
Using trackback URLs
Trackbacks are a simple way of properly referencing other people’s blogs.
Say you are writing a blog entry about how you bought a new house. While
you were making the decision about which street to buy on, you read a really
good blog entry on someone else’s blog that helped you make your choice.
You want to say thank you to that person by referencing their blog in yours.
You can do this by adding a trackback to your blog entry. A trackback is a spe-
cial URL that lets other blogs know they have been referenced. To find the track-
back URL of the blog you want to reference, look for a link called Trackback on
the entry. Most blogs display a URL that you can then copy and paste into your
blog entry. Then when you add your entry, a message is sent to the other blog.
In DNN, these trackback pings are shown as comments next to your blog
entry. This means that if someone adds a trackback to your blog on their site,
it adds a comment to your blog.
The following options are provided to enable and set trackbacks:
 Allow Trackback Comments: If you select this option, when another
blog adds your blog entry as a trackback, those comments from the
trackback pings are shown on your site as comments.
 Approval for Trackback Comments Required: If you select this option,
it marks the pings you receive from trackbacks as needing approval.
This option can help reduce the amount of spam you receive on your
blog comments. These comments are approved as usual.
 Trackback Auto Discovery (Client Mode): When this option is enabled,
the Most Recent Blog Entries module searches for any links in your blog
post and determines if those links are trackback-enabled. If they are, a
trackback ping is automatically sent to those sites.
 Send Mail Notification After Comments and Trackbacks Are Posted:
This option sends you an e-mail each time someone adds a comment or
a trackback to your blog so you can either approve it or read it.
197
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

Syndicate this blog
Syndicating a blog means that you can display a summary of the blog on
another page by using the News Feeds module, or others can display a 
summary of your blog on their Web site with a link to read it on your site.
Selecting a blog for syndication adds the XML icon beside that blog on both
the Most Recent Blog Entries module and the Blog List module. Syndication
of blogs works the same as for the News Feeds module: You simply click on
the XML button, copy the URL from your Web browser into the News Feed
Source field of the News Feed module, select a style sheet, and you can 
display a summary of the blog anywhere on your portal.
Here’s how to set a blog as syndicated:
1. Select the blog from the Blog List module.
2. Select Edit Blog Settings from the module menu.
3. Scroll down to the Syndication section.
4. Select the Syndicate this blog option.
This adds the XML button beside the module.
5. Enter an e-mail address in the Use This E-mail for the Managing Editor
RSS field.
When a blog is syndicated, the XML file references an e-mail address for
the Webmaster and Managing Editor of the blog. Depending on the style
sheet applied, the e-mail address may be displayed in the syndicated
feed. By entering an e-mail address here, you can control the e-mail 
referenced for this syndication. If no e-mail is entered, the Administrator
e-mail (as set on the Site Settings page) is used instead.
6. Click Update.
Creating permalinks to your blog
A permalink (or permanent link) is a link that doesn’t change for a long time.
The purpose of a permalink is to let bloggers, and other interested people,
generate a link to an entry and then quote that link in their own blog or Web
site.
To get the permalink of an entry, do the following:
1. Search for or navigate to the entry.
2. Click the Permalink link.
The permalink will now be displayed in the address bar of your browser.
198
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

3. Copy the link from the address bar.
You can now add the link to a new blog entry, or wherever you want to
reference this entry.
Getting to Know Forums
A forum is a place where people go to participate in online discussions.
Forums have taken the place of bulletin boards and news groups, which were
common in the earlier days of the Web. The Web has forums on nearly any
topic you can think of, and forums are the places to go to ask questions,
share thoughts, show off your expertise, or just have a bit of a rant.
Forums are great for building communities because they give people a real
sense of belonging. They are also great for your site because you can let
people join in and they end up writing lots of content for your site and help
inspire you for new topics.
The DNN Forum module
The DNN Forum module, shown in Figure 7-5, gives you everything you need
to manage forums for either small or very large groups. Start by adding a
Forum module to a new page and we’ll give you the grand tour.
The module displays a table listing of all the forums, a summary of how many
threads and posts are in each forum, and when a forum was last posted to. If
you haven’t edited the forums yet, you will see a sample Forum Group (called
Discussions) and a sample Forum (called General).
Figure 7-5:
The Forum
module’s
initial view.
199
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

In the top area of the module are four buttons (My Settings, My Posts, Search,
and Forum Home) that all users can see. There is also a Moderate button,
which is visible only to Administrators and moderators and also an Admin
button which is available only to site and forum administrators. (See
“Creating a moderated forum” for more information on what a moderated
forum is and how to create one.)
Depending on the module container, these buttons might also be displayed to
the Administrator in the bottomleft corner as hyperlinks.
The Forum Administration page
All administration tasks are managed from one handy control panel, called
the Forum Administration page, shown in Figure 7-6. This page is accessed
via the module menu.
General Settings
The General Setting section manages the layout and design of the module,
the behavior of how users will view the module, which community features
are enabled in the module, and settings for attaching files. This section also
manages the enabling and setting for RSS news feeds of posts.
Forum Users
The Forum Users section provides you with a searchable list of forum users
and manages profiles of each person. Information includes basic details from
their DNN User Account maintained under Admin➪Site Settings as well as
additional profile information such as hobbies and occupation. Both the user
and Administrators can maintain all information that isn’t part of their DNN
user account. Users are able to access this page via the My Settings page.
Administrators have some additional options at the bottom of each user
account where they can set a user as trusted to post responsibly to a moder-
ated forum, or make them a moderator of a moderated forum.
Figure 7-6:
The Forum
Administra-
tion page.

Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Avatars
The user avatar section allows users to associate a picture with their user
profile. This option can be turned on or off depending on the Administrator’s
preferences. When users upload avatars, a thumbnail is generated based on
the dimensions set in this section. Users are also restricted to the file size
listed as the user image size limit. 
If the Administrator configures the module to use an avatar image pool, users
will not be permitted to upload their own images but instead will be allowed
to select from a list of images uploaded by the site or module Administrator.
The system avatars behave similarly to the user avatars in terms of how they
are uploaded, but also work in a similar manner as the user avatar image
pool. These system avatars are uploaded by module Administrators just like
the pool ones explained previously, but the main difference here is these
avatars can only be assigned to users by module or site Administrators
instead of the user selecting one themselves. One final important note here is
that a user can only have one User avatar, but may have an infinite number of
system avatars.
Manage Forums/Groups
The Manage Forums/Groups section enables you to add, edit, and manage
groups and forums. If you want to take a forum offline for a while, you do it
here by editing a forum.
The Manage Forums/Groups section enables you to add new forums and
groups, edit forum and group settings, as well as delete or make a forum inac-
tive. This section also lets you change the order that forums are listed, edit,
and manage forum groups and forums. Forum settings include the ability to
restrict the roles that can view and edit a forum and the ability to set a forum
as moderated.
Word Filter
This section lets you add any words or phrases you don’t want posted to
your forums and replaces them with a word of your choice. For example, you
might like to filter out the phrase “Builders Nightmare” and replace it with
“Renovators Delight.” More likely, you will use the filter to replace obsceni-
ties with a more polite phrase/word or a filter such as ****. You can filter
both the subject and body.
Statistics & Ranking
This area lets you set the forum to rank forum users by the number of posts
they have added. Users that contribute a set number of posts have a 1–10
star icon added beside their user details on their posts. This section lets you
set the number of posts required to rank.
201
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

Creating a public forum
A public forum is available for all your site users to view. Public forums don’t
let people add posts anonymously. If an unauthenticated user attempts to
add a post, they receive an Access Denied message, although no buttons are
shown to them which mislead them to believe that they can do this.
Here’s how to create a forum that all site visitors can view, but to which only
registered users can add a post:
1. Add a new page called Forums.
2. Add the Forum module to the page.
3. Click Settings in the module menu.
Role access is managed the same way as with other modules. View
Module sets which roles can view the module and any posts, whereas
Edit Module sets which roles are Administrators of this module.
4. Set permissions to View Module to All Users and click Update.
5. Select Forum Administration from the module menu.
6. Click Manage Forums/Groups.
7. Here you can edit, add, and delete Groups and Forums.
8. Expand the group by clicking the plus icon.
Expanding the group displays any existing forums and the Add Forum
link is now displayed. If this is your first time configuring the module
after placing it on the page, you will see a group called Discussions.
Note: You cannot add a post to a group, only to a forum; for example,
you can’t add a post to the Group called Discussions, only to the forum
called General.
9. Click Add Forum.
You must complete the Forum Name field when adding a new forum, as
well as select a Group that this forum will belong to. If you want to add a
description, you can do so at this time by typing information you expect
to be discussed in your forum in the description field.
10. Click Update.
To see the new forum, click the Forum Home link.
Turning a forum off
If you don’t want one of your forums to be visible on your site, you can do so
without deleting it:
202
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

1. Select Forum Administration from the module menu.
2. Click Manage Forums/Groups.
3. Expand the group and click the Edit button beside the required
forum.
4. Deselect the Enable Forum option.
5. Click Update.
Posting to a forum
Having your say in a forum is known as making a post. Starting a new topic is
called a starting a new thread. Here’s how to start a new thread:
1. Click Forum Home and click on the name of the forum you want to
post to.
This takes you to the page of the selected forum. If any posts have been
made to the forum, they are listed here. Remember, you can’t post to a
group, only to a forum.
2. Click the New Thread button.
This takes you to the Add/Edit page, which is shown in Figure 7-7.
3. In the Subject box, type a subject that best describes the content and
purpose of the post. This will be the title of the post as it appears on
the site.
4. Enter the content of your post in the large text box.
5. (Optional.) Click the Insert Image or Insert Smiley buttons if you want
from within the text editor.
6. (Optional.) Upload an attachment.
Attachments must be enabled in order for you to be allowed to upload
them. If attachments are not enabled, you will not see this as an option.
However, if they are enabled and you want to add an attachment to your
post, simply click the Browse button and select your attachment from
your local file system. Click Upload File. After you do this, the file you
just uploaded will be selected in the drop-down list.
7. (Optional.) Select Pinned to have the thread listed first in this forum.
Pin important threads that you want to be prominent to everyone. When
new threads are added, they are listed below any pinned ones. Only
Administrators, Page Editors, and Moderators of forums have the right
to pin a post.
203
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

8. Select Notification to receive e-mail notification wherever someone
replies to your post.
This is great if you are looking for answers or if it’s a hot topic for you.
You will not see this option if you are already subscribed to notifications
for the forum you are posting this message in.
9. Select Locked to prevent others from replying to this post.
Not everyone who is authorized to post to a forum has the ability to lock
their post from replies. The settings for this are controlled by the
Administrators from the Forum Edit section of the module outlined in
Chapter 14. Locking a post keeps the thread from being replied to by
other users.
10. Click Update.
The post is now displayed.
Replying to forums is pretty easy too. Here’s all you have to do:
1. Click Forum Home and click on the name of the forum you want to
reply in.
This takes you to the forum. The post you want to reply to should be
listed. If there are lots of posts, you may need to do a search to find it.
2. Click the Reply button.
Do your thing again.
3. Click Update.

Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Sometimes your reply will be relevant to only one part of a post and you want
to make it easy for people to know what you’re talking about. At other times,
the thread you are replying to might already have ten posts and your reply is
targeted at one reply in particular. By selecting Quote instead of Reply, the
body of the original post is added inside the editor. This helps others under-
stand the point of your post.
The Forums module has its own search function, although the standard DNN
search works just fine. The search is simple to use, so we won’t take you
through it in detail. To use the Forum Search, simply click the Search button,
which is shown by a magnifying glass, and you will be navigated to a screen
that allows you to search by who posted it, what the subject is you are look-
ing for, the date range during which the post was posted, which forums it
may be in, and what is the content of the post you are searching for. Please
note that leaving any of these blank will search for anything matching all the
criteria you input on this screen.
Creating a role-restricted (private) forum
Say you’ve created a public forum where all of your registered users are
having their say. The forum is so popular, in fact, that you have decided to
create a second forum called Property Management just for your Property
Managers. You don’t, however, want your customers or your competitors
looking at this forum because it includes some great ideas you want to keep
under wraps. What you need is a role-restricted or private forum.
This is how you can control which roles can view and post to a forum:
1. Select Forum Administration from the module menu.
2. Click Manage Forums/Groups.
3. Expand the group and click the Edit button beside the forum to be
edited.
4. Expand the General Settings section.
5. At the very bottom, deselect the Inherit View permissions from
Module checkbox.
This changes what items you can select in the permissions grid View
Forum column.
6. To set which roles can view the forum, select the View Forum column
check box next to each role that you want to see this forum.
205
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

7. To control which roles can post in this forum, uncheck the Inherit
Posting Restrictions permissions from Module View.
This allows you to select the Start Threads and Post Replies columns for
the roles that you would like to be able to post in that forum. Please
note that the difference here is that Start Threads means users can
create new threads, and Post Replies refers to users being able to only
respond to existing threads.
8. Click Update when finished.
Filtering out the bad words
The Word Filter located on the Forum Administration page lets you filter out
undesirable words and phrases. To turn it on, select the Enable Bad Word
Filter option, select Include Subject if you want to filter words in the Subject
line as well.
Moderating what people say in forums
Is replacing the naughty words with the Word Filter not quite enough? Would
you like to read people’s posts before they appear on the site? Would you like
the chance to edit poor spelling or to delete undesirable posts? All this is
possible: It’s called moderating. You can set which forums are moderated and
can be notified by e-mail when you have a post that’s awaiting moderation.
The people who are able to moderate forums are called Moderators.
Creating a moderated forum
Administrators can set any forum as moderated as well as select which users
have the ability to moderate posts to that forum:
1. Select Forum Administration from the module menu.
2. Click Manage Groups/Forums.
3. Expand a forum group and click the Edit button beside the forum you
want to moderate.
4. Expand the General Settings section.
5. Select Forum Is Moderated.
Choosing the Moderated option means new posts must be approved before
they go live. The only people whose posts don’t need approval are
Administrators, moderators of any moderated forums, and trusted users.
206
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

A new option is now displayed that enables you to choose the moderators for
this forum. Choose the moderators for this forum by looking up there user-
names one at a time and click Add Moderator.
You can also assign moderators by role by selecting the check box for each role
that you desire to be a moderator of the forum. Remember, Administrators,
Global Moderators, and Forum Admin, which are assigned in the module set-
tings, are moderators of all forums, including nonmoderated ones.
Selecting a moderator
Moderators are the people you trust to approve or reject posts in moderated
forums. Choose people who know what is okay to say, who understand the
political climate, and who get what you are trying to achieve in this forum.
Moderators are the trustees of their community, so think carefully and get
the best person for the job.
Moderators and Administrators also have the ability to edit a post and move
it to another forum. Moderators can only edit and move posts in forums they
can moderate, whereas Administrators can do this for all forums.
Consider putting together some guidelines for your moderators so they
understand exactly what you expect of them. Also, using the Word Filter
makes life easier for your moderators as the replacement happens before the
post is presented for moderation. That way, they don’t have to scan the text
for those undesirable words.
Moderators can choose to receive e-mail notification when new posts require
moderation. This option is called Enable Moderator E-mails and is located
inside the Tracking/Subscription section on each user’s settings page.
Moderating forum posts
Moderating forum posts lets you choose the way to handle the post, whether
it is adding it to the page, editing the post before adding it, or deleting the
post. Moderation also includes e-mailing information back to the poster on
how their post was handled.
To try out moderation, you might like to log in as a registered user and add a
few posts to a moderated forum. To moderate a forum post, click the
Moderate button. This returns a list of any posts that you have permission to
moderate. You have a few different moderation options to choose from:
 Approve: This approves the post and notifies the poster of the approval.
 Approve and Reply: This approves the post, notifies the poster of the
approval and lets you add a reply. This is the best way to moderate
because moderators add their expertise on the fly and posts are
responded to quickly.
207
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

 Approve and Edit: This approves the post, notifies the poster of the
approval, and adds the post to the editor for you to edit.
All Approve options add the post to the site regardless of whether you
then reply or edit it. Make sure you have read the post before clicking
any of the Approve options.
 Delete: This deletes the post and notifies the poster of the reason it was
deleted, which you must supply.
You can also do post moderation when you are reading through posts. This is
great for a bit of on-the-fly additional moderation.
Do you trust me?
If you trust some people to say only the right stuff, you can set it so that their
posts aren’t moderated. This saves you moderation time and their posts are
still automatically filtered for naughty words if you are using the Word Filter.
One important note about this is that you can automatically trust all new
users for your forum. To make this happen, you need to go into the Forum
Administration, General Settings section and select the Trust New Users
check box.
1. Select Forum Administration from the module menu.
2. Click Forum Users.
3. Click on the first letter of the user’s first name in the alphabet list, 
or click All to view all users.
Clicking the first letter or the All link returns a list of all matching users.
4. Click the Edit button beside the required user.
5. Expand the Admin Settings section.
6. Select Is Trusted.
7. Click Update.
Changing the layout and design
There are a number of options to modify the appearance of the module on
the page and the skins or themes applied to it. The following settings can be
managed by selecting Forum Administration from the module menu and click-
ing on General Settings.
208
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Change the forum name
You can change the name of the forum, which is the link located in the top-
left corner of the module below the module title, by changing the Forum
Name text.
Change the theme/skin
The Forums module comes with a few themes to choose from. Themes
change design elements like images, buttons, colors, fonts, and so on. A
theme is like a skin that goes inside the module container. Depending on
which themes you have installed, your options will vary. To select a theme,
select any item from the Theme drop-down list that you want to use.
Change page layout
Set the standard layout of forum pages by setting the number of threads and
posts that are displayed per page. This only affects users who are not logged
in and the users who are new. A logged-in user can override this based on
their own settings from My Settings screen.
Changing Member Name Display
The Member Name Display determines how all users will appear to other
users throughout your forum. Select an item in this drop-down list such 
as username, or display name. Username, for example, displays the registered
users’ username to all users who are authorized to see posts by this user.
Enabling Thread Status
Thread status allows your users to select a thread status when posting a new
thread in a forum. This allows other users to quickly associate what type of
topic this is. For example, a user may post a question and set the thread
status as Unresolved. All users will see an icon associated with the thread,
which signifies that the thread is unresolved. After the user who originally
posted the thread receives an acceptable answer, they can change the status
of the thread to Resolved. The other option available here is Informative.
Enabling Private Messaging
This is within the next section entitled Community. Selecting this will allow
users to communicate with one another outside of the public and private
forums. Private Messaging is a conversation between only two users that
nobody else will have access to.
Enabling Member List
When the Member List is enabled, users can view other users’ profiles and
send them private messages by using a convenient search option available in
the Member List.

Going Public with Newsletters
When you have exciting news, you probably just can’t want to share it with
your Web site users. And why should you? DNN comes with a Newsletter
module that lets you send an e-mail newsletter to your users in a flash.
Located on the Admin➪Newsletters page, the Newsletter module lets you
create either an HTML message by using the RTE, or a plain text message.
Newsletters can be sent to one or more security roles at a time and can
include an attachment.
To send a newsletter to one or more security roles, follow these steps:
1. Go to Admin➪Newsletters.
The Newsletters window opens, as shown in Figure 7-8.
Figure 7-8:
Sending a
newsletter
by using the
Newsletters
module.
210
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

2. In the User Role(s) area, select each role that you want to send a mes-
sage to.
If someone belongs to more than one security role, they will still only
receive one newsletter. Skip this step if you only want to send the
newsletter to individual e-mail addresses rather than to security roles.
3. Enter any e-mail addresses that you want to send the e-mail to in the
Email List field.
Skip this step if you only want to send the newsletter to the security
roles selected in Step 2.
4. Enter a subject for the e-mail in the Subject field.
5. Enter your message in the Rich Text Editor, which is selected by
default.
You can add images, links, and format your text as usual.
6. Expand the Advanced Settings section.
7. (Optional.) Select an attachment in the Attachment drop-down list. 
If you don’t see a file you want to attach, you can select Upload New
File and then select it from the drop-down list.
This field displays all the files in your File Manager and lets you add new
files. You can only attach one file to the newsletter. If you want to send
more than one file, zip them into one file first.
8. Select a Send Method from the drop-down box.
This field lets you change the way the e-mail is sent. The To: One Message
Per E-mail address (Personalized) option is selected by default. This
option sends one e-mail to each person and adds the word Dear fol-
lowed by their first and last name to the beginning of the e-mail.
For any individual e-mail addresses entered at Step 3, the To option 
adds their e-mail address to the beginning of the newsletter because
their first and last name isn’t known. (For example, Dear lorraine@
domain.com.)
The second option is the Bcc: One E-mail to Blind Distribution List (Not
Personalized) option. This option adds all the e-mail addresses to a
blind distribution list. This option doesn’t personalize the e-mail, mean-
ing it will not make each outgoing e-mail unique to the person receiving
it. This option requires a lot less bandwidth and processing because it
only creates one e-mail. Consider this option if you are sending to lots of
people.
211
Chapter 7: Getting Interactive with DotNetNuke

9. Click Send E-mail.
A Message Sent message is displayed at the top of the Newsletter
module. This lets you know that processing and sending of the news-
letter has started. DNN batches the e-mails into small groups and sends
one group at a time. This means it won’t try to send a thousand e-mails
all at once and overload your e-mail system. When the sending is com-
plete, the Administrator receives a Bulk E-mail Confirmation e-mail mes-
sage, shown in Figure 7-9, that details when the newsletters began and
finished sending, how many people the e-mail was sent to, and how
many messages were sent.

Collaborating and Selling 
with DNN
In This Chapter
 Showcase and share with the Repository module
 Sell it with the Store module
 Collaborate with Wiki
I
n this chapter, we cover how to use more of the standard DNN modules.
The first two modules detailed in this chapter are Repository and Store.
Both are included with your DNN installation. The third module covered here
is the Wiki module, which isn’t included with your DNN installation but is
available for free download from the DotNetNuke Web site. If any of these
modules are not displayed in the module drop-down list on the Control Panel,
you or your host will need to install them. See Chapter 3 for more on
installing modules.
Showcase and Share with the 
Repository Module
The Repository is a very flexible module that has a number of unique uses.
Some of the ways in which you might use the Repository are to store and dis-
play a list of documents; as a Web site directory of your favorite sites; or as
an image library where users can upload and share images with each other.
The Repository module also has an optional companion module called the
Repository Dashboard. This module can be set a number of different ways to
display links to repository categories and files.

A common use of the Repository module, shown in Figure 8-1, is to manage
the upload and storage of a range of file types. A detailed listing of each item
is displayed in the module, or users can filter items by category or search for
an item. Each item can display all or some of this information: an image of the
file, a URL, a description of the file, the size of the file, the number of times the
file has been downloaded, the date and time when the item was uploaded or
last edited, and the name and e-mail address of the person who uploaded it.
The Repository module is designed to be used as a community module
whereby your Web site users can participate at different levels to maintain
and access the content. Depending on the rights assigned by Administrators,
users can upload files, moderate newly uploaded files, download files, rate
files, and add comments and ratings to the item.
Repository skins control the type of information managed by each Repository
module. Changing the repository skin can change it from a simple blog to a
media library in moments.
Figure 8-1:

Repository
module with
the Default
skin.
214
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

The skin that controls the purpose of the Repository module is different 
from the container applied to the module or the skin applied to the page.
Repository skins are specially developed for this module and are not man-
aged by using the Admin Skins area. The skin applied to the Repository
module is set under the Repository Settings section on the Module Settings
page of the module. A number of skins are provided with the Repository
module, each creating a different layout and displaying different information.
Setting Up the Repository
All administrative settings for the Repository module are managed from the
module menu. Here you are able to configure the page layout of the module,
the repository skin, and security role access to perform tasks such as file
upload and moderation. You can also add new categories that people can use
to filter items.
The fastest setup this side of Texas
To achieve a basic setup for the Repository module, you only have to set a
couple of fields and it’s ready to go. This setup creates a Repository that per-
mits Administrators to upload files and permits anyone who can view the
module to download it.
Here’s how to set up a basic repository module:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This takes you to the Module Settings page. Go to the last section called
Repository Settings.
2. Click the Maximize button to open the Repository Settings section.
This section enables you to set and modify the settings and Repository
skin for this module.
3. Enter a description of the module in the Rich Text Editor (RTE) below
Repository Description.
The description appears between the module title and any files added to
the Repository. Choose a description that best describes the content
you will be adding to the module. (For example: “Feel free to browse our
photo gallery and download any of our royalty-free photographs. You
can also add your own photos to our gallery by clicking the Upload
button below.”)
215
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

4. Go to the Security Roles setting and select the All Users check box
below Download Roles.
This enables everyone who is able to view the module to download files.
5. Below the No Image field, select or upload a default image by using
the Link Type tool.
Depending on the repository skin selected, items added to the reposi-
tory may display an image. If you don’t upload an image when adding
the item, the image selected here will be used.
6. Click the Update link.
You have created a basic Repository where Administrators can upload
and manage files and all users can download files.
Adding more categories
The Repository has a drop-down box that lets people filter items by cate-
gories, making it easy for them to browse through the listed items. The
Repository comes with only one default category called All, so you have the
task of adding others to suit your needs.
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This takes you to the Module Settings page. Go to the Repository
Settings.
2. Click the Maximize button to open the Repository Settings section.
This section enables you to set and modify the settings and Repository
skin for this module.
3. Enter a name for the category into the text box below the Categories
field.
4. Click the Add Category link.
The new category is now added to the list of categories in the below
box. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to add more categories. When you are fin-
ished, either click the Cancel link below or navigate back to the page.
An All category is created by default. You can delete or edit the All category;
however, you must always have at least one category in the list. If you delete
all the categories, a new All category is created automatically.
You can also change the order in which the categories are displayed by
selecting a category and using the up- and down-arrow icons to move it. 
If no categories are selected when a file is uploaded, it will automatically be
assigned to the first category in the category list.
216
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Setting the unique Repository 
security roles
The Repository has been designed with community participation in mind, so
a variety of additional security settings are available to enable users to par-
ticipate at different levels.
Earlier in this chapter (see “The fastest setup this side of Texas”), we create a
basic security scheme where only Administrators can upload and maintain
files, but where all users can view and download files. There are, however,
five different security roles specific to the Repository.
Here’s how to set the Repository security role access:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This takes you to the Module Settings page.
2. In the Basic Settings section under Module Settings, set the View
Module Permissions for the module.
Under View Module, you can set which roles will be able to see the
module. Do not change the Edit Module settings, as they are managed 
at Step 4 below.
3. Click the Maximize button to open the Repository Settings section.
4. At Security Roles, select the DNN security roles assigned to the
Repository roles. You can allow either All Users, Administrators,
Registered Users, or Subscribers access to each role.
Here is a summary of each repository role:
• Moderation Roles: Members of this role are able to moderate (that
is, approve or reject) new items. See “Moderating new items” later
in this chapter for details on how to moderate.
• Download Roles: Members of this role are able to download files
by clicking the Download button.
• Upload Roles: Members of this role are able to upload new items
by clicking the Upload button.
• Rating Roles: Members of this role are able to rate files by clicking
on the rating bar.
• Comment Roles: Members of this role are able to add comments to
a listing by clicking the Upload button.
217
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

5. At View User Comments, select who can view comments added to 
listings.
Choose between All Users, which lets anyone who can view the
Repository also view any comments, or Authorized Users Only, which
only allows those set at Comment Roles in Step 4 to view comments.
6. At View User Ratings, select who can view ratings given to listings.
Choose between All Users, which lets anyone who can view the
Repository also view the ratings, or Authorized Users Only, which only
allows those set at Rating Roles in Step 4 to view ratings.
7. Click the Update link.
The Administrator role is mandatory for all Repository security roles. If you
deselect Administrators for any role, it will be automatically reselected when
you update your settings.
Changing the Function of the Repository
The default skin for the Repository, (refer to Figure 8-1), lets people view and
download files, as well as rate and comment on each listing. But the Repository
can be used for endless purposes, depending on the skin applied to the
module.
Setting the skin
You can change the skin applied to the Repository at any time; however, it is
best to choose the purpose of your Repository and apply the best skin before
you begin adding files. Each skin gives you different fields to complete when
adding listings, so choosing a skin before you start ensures that the content
remains relevant to the skin. The FileList skin, shown in Figure 8-2, transforms
the Repository into a compact list of download files.
Here is how to set a skin:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This takes you to the Module Settings page of this module.
2. Click the Maximize button to open the Repository Settings section.
3. Select a skin from the Repository Skin drop-down box.
Listings are sorted by the selected field in the Repository.
4. Click the Update link.
You are now returned to the Repository and the new skin is applied.
218
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

There are two types of Repository skins: global and portal. Global skins are
stored in the \DesktopModules\Repository\Templates folder of your Web
site and are available to all Repository modules on all portals that are on
your Web site.
Portal skins are stored in the \Portals\#\RepositoryTemplates folder and are
only available to Repository modules that are on pages for that particular
child portal number.
Both global and portal skins are included in the Repository Skins drop-down
box; however, portal skins are prefixed with an asterisk for identification.
Choosing a skin to suit
At the time of writing, twelve different skins were included with the
Repository. Each skin provides a different layout, has different fields, and
changes the purpose of the Repository.
Here is a summary of these different skins:
 Articles: Transforms the Repository into an article list. Each listing
requires an article title, categories, a downloadable version of the arti-
cle, a summary of the article and the article text. Displaying a picture of
the author and her e-mail address are optional. The date and time when
an entry was last updated is automatically displayed on each listing, as
is the name of the user who uploaded the item. Comments and Ratings
can be added.
 Blog: Transforms the Repository into a simple blog, as shown in Fig-
ure 8-3. Each entry requires a subject title, a category, and blog text. The
date and time when an entry was last updated is automatically displayed
on each listing. Displaying the blogger’s e-mail address is optional.
Comments can be added.

Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

 Business Cards: Transforms the Repository into a Business Card direc-
tory. Each entry requires the company name, company logo, categories,
optional attributes, company address and other contact details, and a
company tagline. The date when an entry was last updated is automati-
cally displayed on each listing. This skin also works well as a contacts
list if you change the logo to a person’s photograph.
 Default: The default skin, (refer to Figure 8-1), is a file repository. Each
listing requires a title, a file to download, an image, categories, optional
attributes, and a description of the file. Each listing automatically dis-
plays the name of the user who uploaded the item, the file size, and the
date and time when the item was last updated, as well as the number of
times the file has been downloaded. Ratings and comments can be
added.

Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

 Directory: Transforms the Repository into a Web site resource direc-
tory. This skin can also be used as a compact alternative to the default
skin. Each listing requires a title, the resource URL (for example, www.
domain.com/sample.doc), categories, and a description of the URL.
An image can be added, but it is not displayed. Each listing displays the
title, number of hits, date and time the listing was last updated, descrip-
tion, and a Visit link which opens the resource URL in a new browser.
 File List: Transforms the Repository into a basic and file list. This skin
displays items in the most compact format of all skins and each listing is
only a single line. Listings consist of only the file title, date and time it
was last updated, the file size, and a link to download the file. No images
or icons are displayed. Comments and ratings are not available.
 Nifty: This skin offers the same information as the default skin, but it has
a “nifty” layout and design. (Well, somebody thinks it’s nifty, anyway.)
 Nifty Toggle: This skin offers the same information as the default skin
and the same layout and design as the Nifty skin. The difference is that a
Show Details button is displayed rather than the description. Clicking on
the button displays the description. This is handy when the descriptions
are long as it keeps the page compact.
 Portfolio: Transforms the Repository into an images or photo gallery.
Each listing requires a title, image, categories, and a description of the
image. Listing automatically displays the date and time when the item
was last updated. Ratings and comments are available.
 Slides: Transform the Repository into a photo gallery, as shown in
Figure 8-4. This skin has a crisp design and each image is displayed as a
slide. Each listing requires a title, image, categories, optional attributes,
name and e-mail address of the person who uploaded the image, and a
description of the file. Listings automatically display the date and time
the image was last updated and a copyright notice. Ratings and com-
ments are available.
 Video Library: Transform the Repository into a video library. Each list-
ing requires a title, URL to the Video, a splash image, categories, and a
description. Listings automatically display the file size and the date and
time the entry was last updated. Ratings and comments can be added.
Create custom attributes in the same way you create categories. An attributes
field is provided on several of the skins; however, these attributes are not dis-
played on any of them. If you want to display custom attributes, you need to
have a custom skin created. To find out how to create new Repository skins 
or add attributes to existing Repository skins, go to the Repository Project
page on the DotNetNuke Web site (www.dotnetnuke.com/DotNetNuke
Projects/ModuleRepository/tabid/830/Default.aspx). Click the
Project Downloads link and download the latest users’ guide.

Changing the page layout
The Administrator can modify the layout of Repository pages by changing
the default sort order of listings, the number of listings per page, and a
default image to be displayed when one isn’t uploaded to the listing.

Here’s how to change the page layout:
1. Select Settings from the module menu.
This takes you to the Module Settings page of this module.
2. Click the Maximize button to open the Repository Settings section.
3. Select an option from the Default Sort drop-down box.
Choose the field that you want listings to be sorted by when displayed
in the Repository. Choose from Date, Downloads, User Rating, Title, or
Author Name.
4. Change the number in the Enter the Number Of Items Per Page text
box.
This setting controls the number of items displayed on each page. Next
and Back links are displayed above and below listings to enable people
to access other listings. You might like to change the number of items
per page according to the Skin selected. For example, if you are using
the FileList skin, each listing is only one line; therefore, it would be rea-
sonable to display up to 20 items per page.
5. Select an option from the Image Set To Use for Ratings drop-down box.
Choose Default to display a five-star rating scale or Dashes to display a
ten-bar rating scale.
6. Click the Update link.
You are now returned to the Repository and your changes are applied.
Working with Repository Files
After you have set up the Repository, you can begin adding files. File upload
is available to members of any security roles selected as Upload Roles under
Repository Settings. See “Setting the unique Repository security roles” to find
out how to set File Upload roles. Note that the fields to be completed vary,
depending on the skin.
Here is how to upload a file and add a new listing for the Default skin:
1. Click the Upload button.
This takes you to the Upload a File page, as shown in Figure 8-5.
2. Enter a title into the Title text box.
The title will be the name of the listing.

Displaying quick links by 
using the dashboard
The Repository module has a companion module called the Repository
Dashboard module. This module can display different information relating to
the Repository module such as a list of categories, the latest uploads, the top
downloads, and the top rated item.
Here’s how to set up the Repository Dashboard module:
1. Add the Repository Dashboard module to a page.
You can add the dashboard to any page on your Web site.
2. Select Settings from the module menu.
This displays the Module Settings page of this module.
3. Select the page/title of a Repository module from the Select
Repository drop-down box.
This setting lets you select which Repository module on your Web site
you want this dashboard to be associated with.
4. Choose a radio button to set the information to be displayed from the
Dashboard Module field. Your options are

Selling Stuff with a Store
One of the greatest benefits of having a Web site is the ability to create an
online marketplace where people can browse and buy your wares 24 hours a
day. Online stores are cheap to set up, cheap to run, and they give you a
global presence that would be difficult to achieve with a physical shop at
your local mall.
The DNN Store consists of five modules that work together to create a full
online shopping experience. Your Web site visitors can browse your prod-
ucts, add them to a virtual shopping cart, and purchase them by using a
secure online payment gateway. Administrators can manage products,
manage product reviews, and manage customer orders as well as provide
authorized roles with the ability to also manage products. In the upcoming
section, we describe each of the five Store modules.
The Store Menu (Categories) module
The Store Menu module (which is titled Categories after you add it to a page,
so that’s what we call it in this chapter) enables customers to browse prod-
ucts by selecting a category. This module works with the Catalog module,
which displays the description of the selected category and its products.
Categories can be managed by using either this module or the Store Admin
module. Administrators, and other authorized roles, can add, edit, archive,
and delete categories by using the Categories module menu. See Figure 8-6 to
check out the Categories module in action.
229
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

The Store Catalog module
The Store Catalog module (which is titled Catalog after you add it to a page,
so that’s what we call it in this chapter) displays results from the Categories
module. When a category is selected, the Catalog module displays the cate-
gory description and a summary listing of all products within the selected
category. Each listing includes a linked product title that goes to a detailed
product description, and an Add to Cart link. Look at Figure 8-6 to see the
Catalog module in action.
The Store Mini Cart module
The Store Mini Cart module displays a brief listing of any products in a cus-
tomer’s cart. This module provides customers with quick way of seeing how
many products they have added to their cart and the total cost. Customers
can adjust product quantities or delete items from their cart. A View Cart
Details link takes customers to the Store Account module, which provides a
detailed view of their shopping cart. See Figure 8-6 to see the Store Mini Cart
module in action.

Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

The Store Account module
The Store Account module, shown in Figure 8-7, provides each customer 
with a place to manage their shopping account. The module consists of three
screens: Customer Cart, Profile, and Order History. Customer Cart is the
default screen, which enables customers to manage any products in their
shopping cart. This screen includes a Checkout link, enabling the customer
to proceed to the Checkout to complete their order. The Profile screen lets
customers add and manage their shipping and billing addresses. The Order
History screen enables customers to view details of their previous orders.
The Store Admin module
The Store Admin module enables Administrators to configure and manage 
all store settings. The module has five administrative sections: Store Info,
Categories, Product, Customers, and Reviews. The Store Info section is
required to configure the store and includes setup of your preferred payment
gateway. The Store Info section is shown in Figure 8-8. The Categories and
Products sections manages adding, editing, archiving, and deletion of cate-
gories and products. The Customer section displays a list of existing store
customers and a summary of their previous orders. The Reviews section
manages the approval, editing, and deletion of customer reviews.

Laying Out Your Store
The Store modules must be arranged on different pages and have different
security roles set to create a shopping experience. As is typical with DNN,
you have full control over which security roles can view pages and modules.
The following example shows how to set up a store that lets all visitors
browse and select products before registering or logging in to their account.
Creating the Store page
Here’s how to set up the page where customers come to browse and buy:
1. Add a page titled Store.
At Permissions for View Page, select All Users.
2. Add the Store Menu (Categories) module to the Store page.
Use all the default options when adding the module. This module looks
good in either the left or right pane.
3. Add the Store Catalog (Catalog) module to the Store page.
Use all the default options when adding the module.
Figure 8-8:

Admin 
page lets
Administrat-
ors set up
the store
and manage
categories,
products,
orders, and
reviews.
232
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

4. Add the Store Mini Cart module to the Store page.
Use all the default options when adding the module. This module looks
good in either the left or right pane or below the Catalog.
The setup of the Store page is now complete. Refer to Figure 8-8 for an
example of the Store page with categories and products.
Creating the Store Account page
Here’s how to set up a page where customers can review their current order,
manage their profile, and view their order history:
1. Add a page titled Store Account.
At Permissions for View Page, select All Users. This enables visitors who
have been browsing and adding items to their Mini Cart to view more
details about what’s in their cart before they need to create an account.
2. Add the Store Account module to the Store Account page.
Use all the default options when adding the module. The setup of your
Store Account page is now complete.
Creating the Store Admin page
Here’s how to set up the Store Administration module:
1. Add a page titled Store Admin.
This is an administration-only page, so use the default page Permissions
settings.
2. Add the Store Admin module to the Store Admin page.
Use all the default options when adding the module. Your Store Admin
page is now ready to be configured. See “Configuring the Store Admin
Module” later in this chapter for details.
Choosing a Payment Provider
Before you can begin selling your products online, you need a method of
receiving payment for your goods. DNN Store has been integrated with two
well-known payment processing companies: PayPal and AuthorizeNet. Both
companies can provide you with an account that enables your store to
accept credit card payments and have these funds paid into an account.
233
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

Both of these companies provide an immediate and low-cost solution to 
processing online transactions. Visit the Web sites for both companies 
(at www.paypay.com and www.authorizenet.com) to see which company
best suits your requirements. After you have made your choice, sign up for
an account with your preferred company. Your account details are required
before you can complete your Store Admin configuration.
AuthorizeNet provides a free test account service, which enables you to test
out the full customer experience of buying from your store. I suggest you
create a test account and use these details for the Gateway Provider setting
until you are ready to go live with your Store.
Configuring the Store Admin Module
To configure the Store Admin module, you first have to complete the Store
Info page:
1. Go to the Store Admin page.
The Store Info page of the Store Admin module is displayed.
2. Complete the Store Name, Description, and Keywords fields.
These fields are used to identify your store in search engines.
3. Enter an e-mail address for the store into the Store Email text box.
This field is used as the e-mail address used by the store.
4. Select Store Account as the Shopping Cart Page.
This field must be set to go to the page where the Store Account module
is added.
5. Select the Update link.
The Store setup is almost complete. The final step is to select and set
your payment gateway.
Setting the payment gateway as PayPal
You must have a current PayPal account to complete this step. Make sure
your account details are handy.
234
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Here is how to complete the payment gateway settings for PayPal:
1. Go to the Store Admin page.
The Store Info page is displayed.
2. Select PayPal Provider from the Gateway drop-down box.
This displays the required PayPal fields.
3. Enter the e-mail address in the PayPal ID field.
This is the e-mail address you used when you created your PayPal
account.
4. Enter your store name into the Cart Name text box.
This is the store name you entered in the first field on this page.
5. Leave the Button URL field as it is.
This field contains the URL to the PayPal Buy Now button. You can
check out the button by pasting the address into a new browser. If you
want to use your own button, enter the URL in this field.
6. Leave the Currency Type as USD.
This sets the currency of your store as U.S. dollars (USD). Although
PayPal accepts money of different currencies, your Store will receive 
and process its funds as U.S. dollars.
7. Click the Update link.
Your store is now ready to receive online payments.
Setting the payment gateway 
as AuthorizeNet
You must have a current AuthorizeNet account to complete this step. Make
sure your account details are handy.
Here is how to complete the payment gateway settings for AuthorizeNet:
1. Go to the Store Admin page.
The Store Info page is displayed.
2. Select AuthorizeNetProvider from the Gateway drop-down box.
This displays the required AuthorizeNet fields.
235
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

3. Enter the Transaction POST URL into the Gateway URL text box.
This URL is supplied by AuthorizeNet when you sign up.
4. Enter 3.1 in the Version text box.
This is the latest version of AuthorizeNet.
5. Enter your Login ID in the Username text box.
AuthorizeNet supplies the Login ID when you sign up.
6. Enter your password in the Password text box.
AuthorizeNet supplies a password when you sign up.
7. Select Auth and Capture in the Capture Type drop-down box.
This sets the transaction type for the Store. Authorize and Capture
(Auth and Capture) sends a request to authorize and receive the funds
for a purchase.
The second option, Authorization Only (Auth Only), sends a request 
to authorize funds, but doesn’t put the money into your account.
AuthorizeNet provides this as an alternative method so that you can
upload and process a large batch of mail order/telephone order (MOTO)
sales. See Virtual Terminal/Batch Upload on the AuthorizeNet Web site
(www.authorizenet.com) if you are interested in finding out more
about this.
8. Select the Test Mode check box if you want to test receiving payments
before launching the store to the pubic.
AuthorizeNet enables you to test your Store before you begin to accept
real transactions. You will need to deselect this option when you are
ready to go live.
9. Click the Update link.
Your store is now configured to receive online payments.
You must go back and deselect the Test Mode check box that you selected in
Step 8 and then update the page before you can start accepting real transac-
tions from customers.
Adding tax rates for each state
The store enables you to add a different taxation rate for each U.S. state. The
tax rate is added to the Item Price of each product and is displayed to the
customer when they go to their cart. The amount of taxation paid is also 
displayed on the confirmation e-mail sent to the customer when they 
complete an order.
236
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Here’s how to set your taxation rates:
1. Go to the Store Admin page.
The Store Info page is displayed.
2. Click the Maximize button beside the Tax Administration section.
This displays an abbreviation of each tax code and the rate applied for
that state. For example, the first box is AL for Alabama. The box below it
displays the current tax rate for Alabama. The default value for each
state is zero (0.00).
3. Edit the tax rate for each state as required.
Tax rates are displayed as a percentage of 1.00, where 1.00 equals 100%
tax. For example, to set the tax rate for Alabama to 10%, change the
value in the text box below the AL text box to 0.10. Values of 1 or more
are not accepted.
4. Click the Update Tax Rates link.
The tax rates are now updated.
Adding a shipping fee
The Store provides you with an option to charge a shipping fee that is a per-
centage of the total order. Here is how to add your shipping fee:
237
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN
Squishing bugs
At the time of writing, the Store Admin module
contained a minor bug. It won’t cause any real
problems, but it is a bit frustrating. The bug
causes the Shipping Fee value to incorrectly be
saved as 0, rather than in the required format 
of 0.00.
This bug means that you have to readd the zeros
to the end of the shipping fee each time you
click the Categories, Products, Customers, or
Review links on the Store Info page, or update
the tax rates. To reduce the need to do this, you
may prefer to use the Category and Catalog
module menus to manage these items.
Here’s how to work around this bug:
1. Whenever you see a warning box that says
“The shipping fee must be in the format
#.##”, click OK on the warning box.
2. Click the Maximize button beside the
Shipping Administration section.
This displays the shipping fee for an order.
3. Enter 0.00 into the Shipping Fee text box.
You can now continue with the task.

1. Go to the Store Admin page.
The Store Info page is displayed.
2. Click the Maximize button beside the Shipping Administration section.
This displays the current shipping fee. The default setting is zero (0.00).
3. Enter the shipping fee.
Shipping fees are displayed as a percentage of 1.00, where 1.00 equals a
100% shipping fee. For example, to add a shipping fee of 10%, change the
value to 0.10. Values greater than 1 are not accepted.
4. Click the Update Shipping Fee link.
The shipping fee is now updated.
Adding Products to the Store
Administrators handle product management by using the Store Admin
module.
You can enable roles other than Administrators to add products by giving
them Edit Module permissions to the Catalog module. This lets them manage
products without being able to change store settings, or manage reviews and
customer accounts. Similarly, you can provide Edit Module permissions on
the Categories module to enable roles to manage product categories.
Creating and managing categories
Here’s how to add a category:
1. Go to the Store Admin page.
This displays the Store Info page of the Store Admin module.
2. Click the Categories link.
It takes you to the Categories management screen, as shown in Fig-
ure 8-9. Any existing categories are listed here.
3. Click the Add Category link.
This takes you to the Add Category screen.
4. Enter a category name into the Category Name text box.
The category name is displayed in the category module to customers to
help them browse through your products.
238
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

5. Enter a short description into the Description text box.
The category description is not displayed to customers and is for your
records only.
6. Leave the Archived check box deselected.
7. Enter category details of the category into the Message text box.
When a customer clicks on a category to view its products, this message
is displayed above the products in the Catalog module.
8. Click the Update link.
The new category is now listed on the Categories page of the Store
Admin module, as well as in the Categories module. Repeat Steps 3
through 8 to add more categories.
Here’s how to edit a category:
1. Go to the Store Admin page.
This page has the Store Admin module on it.
2. Click the Categories link.
This link is one of five located in the top-right corner of the module. It
takes you to the Categories management screen. Any existing categories
are listed here.
3. Click the Edit link beside the category to be edited.
This takes you to the Edit Category screen.
4. Edit the category fields as required.
5. Click the Update link.
Archiving a category hides that category from customers in the Categories
module. This stops customers from being able to browse any products asso-
ciated with that category.
Figure 8-9:
The
Categories
page of the
Store Admin
module.
239
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

4. Click the Delete link.
A message box appears asking if you are sure you want to delete the
item.
5. Click the OK button to confirm.
The category is now deleted.
Creating and managing products
You must add at least one category before you can add products. Each prod-
uct listing displays an image. 
240
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Create a separate folder in your File Manager to keep your store images. If
you are enabling roles other than Administrators to add products, remember
to give those roles access to view and/or edit the folder. Uploading your
product images before you begin adding products saves you time.
Here’s how to add a product:
1. Go to the Store Admin module.

deleted via the Catalog module. Note: Deleting a review is permanent, so you
may prefer to change it to Not Authorized for later consideration. Making a
review Not Authorized removes the review from the product page but not
from your records.
1. Go to the Store Admin page.
2. Click the Reviews link.
This takes you to the Reviews screen. All reviews are displayed.
3. Click the Edit link beside the review to be deleted.
This takes you to an editing screen for this review.
4. Click the Delete link.
A message box appears, asking you if you’re sure you want to delete this
item.

Collaborating with Wiki
A Wiki, shown in Figure 8-12, is a type of Web site where all visitors can add,
edit, and remove HTML content from HTML pages. Popular Wikis include
www.wikipedia.org, which is a Wiki encyclopedia, and www.wikitravel.
org, which is an online travel guide.
246
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

The DNN Wiki module lets Administrators create and manage multiple Wiki
Web sites within the one DNN Web site. The DNN Wiki has a number of tools
that enable users to quickly view the latest changes to a page and view the
differences between each version. This makes it easy to revert to a previous
version of that page. This can be important for a Wiki because they carry the
risk of containing false information.
The ease of reinstating previous copy combined with a simple method of
adding content without registration makes a Wiki ideally suited to collabora-
tive writing.
While the traditional setup of a Wiki enables everyone to contribute to its
content, at the time of writing, the DNN Wiki permitted contributions from
logged-in users only.
The Wiki module isn’t included with your DNN installation, but is available for
free download from the DotNetNuke Web site by going to the Wiki Project page
(www.dotnetnuke.com/DotNetNukeProjects/ModuleWiki/tabid/
848/Default.aspx) and clicking the Project Downloads link. See Chapter 3
to find out how to install modules.
Creating a Wiki Site
The Wiki module lets Administrators build one or more Wiki Web sites; 
however, you can only display one Wiki Web site per module at a time. For
example, if you create a Canine Breeds Wiki site and a Canine Terminology
Wiki site, you need to use two Wiki modules and select which module dis-
plays which Wiki Web site.
Figure 8-12:

Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

Configuring Wiki sites and 
choosing editors
Here’s how to create a Wiki site:
1. Add the Wiki module to a page.
If the security roles that have permission to view the module are the
same as to view the page, skip to Step 6.
2. Select Settings from the module menu.
This takes you to the Module Settings page for this module.
3. Deselect the Inherit View Permissions from Page check box under the
Permissions fields.
4. Select each role that is permitted to view the module.
5. Leave the Edit Module Permissions as they are.
Permissions to edit the Wiki are controlled on a different page. This is a
nonstandard setup.
6. Click the Update link.
This returns you to the page.
7. Select Configure Wiki Sites from the module menu.
This takes you to the Configure Wiki Sites page.
8. Click the Add New Site link.
9. Enter a name for the new Wiki.
10. At Editor Roles, select the check box beside each role that can 
contribute to the Wiki.
The Administrator role is mandatory and can’t be deleted.
11. At Moderator Roles, select the check box beside each role that can
moderate Wiki content.
Moderators can add new pages without moderation.
12. Click the Update link.
This saves your settings.
13. Click the Back link.
This returns you to the main page of the Wiki. To complete the setup,
you must also choose a Home page for the Wiki.
248
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Choose the Wiki Web site for this module
Each Wiki module can manage multiple Wiki Web sites, but the module can
only display one Wiki Web site at a time. The Choose Site and Door setting
lets you choose the Wiki Web site to be displayed in this module and the
start page of that site.
Here’s how to choose the landing page of your Wiki:
1. Select Choose Site and Door from the module menu.
This takes you to the Choose the Home Page page.
2. Select the Wiki Web site for this module in the Connect to a Wiki Site
list.
This displays all pages within this Wiki Web site in the Start Page box
below.
3. Select a page name in the Start Page window to select it as the start
page of this Wiki Web site.
A page called Home Page is automatically created for all new Wiki Web
sites. As more pages are added to the Wiki, they are displayed here. You
can change the start page at any time.
4. Click the Back link.
This takes you to the start page of the selected Wiki Web site, as shown
in Figure 8-13. See “Editing Wiki Pages” later in this chapter for informa-
tion on how to edit the description of the Wiki start page.
Getting to Know Your Wiki
The Wiki displays the Wiki Landing Page and a row of links at the bottom that
enables people to navigate, search, and edit the Wiki, view previous versions
of the content, and more. Access to some links is role-based.
Figure 8-13:
The start
page of a
newly
created
Wiki.
249
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

These buttons are displayed to everyone who can view the module:
 The Home Page button goes to the start page set for this Wiki.
 The View button takes people back to the last page they visited.
 The BackLinks button displays a list of any pages that link to the current
page.
 The History button displays a list of major changes to the current page. By
selecting Show Minor Changes, people can also view any minor changes. 
A View button beside each version displays the text of that version.
 The MyChanges button displays to the user a list of their changes to the
current page. A View button beside each version displays the text of that
version.
Although the MyChanges button is displayed to everyone, people must
log in to view changes.
 The Pages button gives you three options:
• All Pages displays a list of all pages in this Wiki Web site.
• Orphaned Pages displays a list of any pages that aren’t linked to
any other page in this Wiki Web site. This happens when the pages
linking to this page are deleted.
• Strongest Pages displays the list of pages that are linked to the
most.
 The Search button lets people search on all or part of a page name. For
example, if you searched on the word Canine, the search would return
all pages which contained that word, such as Canines, Canine Teeth, and
so on.
 The Latest Changes button displays the ten latest changes to this Wiki
Web site and lets you view any of these versions.
 The Diffs button lets people compare two versions of the Wiki content.
 The Plugins button goes to a page that displays all these buttons.
These buttons are only displayed to Editors and/or Administrators:
250
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

 The Edit button takes Editors to the edit screen of the current page.
 The Delete button is located on the History page and the Pages page. 
On the History page, it enables Editors to delete a page version. On the
Pages page, it enables Editors to delete a page.
 The Maintenance button lets Administrators refresh the Wiki page
records and create exportable versions of the content.
Editing Wiki Pages
Both Administrators and Editors can edit the content of any page. Here’s how
to edit a Wiki page, using the Wiki HomePage as an example:
1. Click the Home Page button.
This is the leftmost link along the bottom of the Wiki.
2. Click the Edit button.
This takes you to the Edit page. The name of the page you are editing is
displayed above the editing box.
3. Edit the text displayed and add your description of the page.
The text that reads [[HomePage]] is included as an example of how to
create a link to another page in this Wiki. You do not need to keep this or
any of the text.
4. Deselect the Minor Change check box.
Most changes to a page will be minor; however, adding the initial
description of the page is considered a major change. Defining each revi-
sion as either major or minor makes it easy to track major changes on
the History and MyChanges pages.
5. Click Save.
You are returned to the landing page and the new description is visible.
Linking to New or Existing Wiki Pages
When you look at the links displayed across the bottom of the Wiki, you may
notice the absence of an Add link. This is because you can only add a new
page by editing an existing page. New pages are added whenever you choose
to link to a Wiki page that doesn’t exist. This ensures that new pages aren’t
created without being relevant to an existing page.
251
Chapter 8: Collaborating and Selling with DNN

Here’s how to add a new page to the Wiki:
1. Go to a Wiki page that should be linked to the new page.
2. Click the Edit button located along the bottom of the module.
3. Create a page link or a new page by writing the name of the page
inside double square brackets in the window.
Any word or phrase enclosed in double square brackets [[]] becomes a
page title. For example, entering the text [[Page Name]] creates a new
page named Page Name or a link to an existing page named Page Name.
4. (Optional.) Deselect the Minor Change box located below the editor if
you have made a major change to page content.
5. Click the Save button.
You are now returned to the page you have just edited. The new descrip-
tion and any links will be visible. A Bomb icon denotes any link that has
created a new page. For example, Figure 8-12 shows three pages called
Bull Terrier, Bulldogs, and Terriers, which do not have text on them.
This lets users know that there is no description on that page as yet.
You can display a page link as a description rather than the page name. Do
this by entering the link name and page name in square brackets, with a pipe
symbol, as follows: [[the link name|PageName]]. For example, [[a person
who is selling their home|Vendor]] will display as a person who is selling
their home on the Wiki page and links to a page called Vendor.
Performing Maintenance on Your Wiki
Administrators can perform some database administrative tasks on their Wiki
to keep the files in order. Here’s how to perform maintenance on your Wiki:
1. Click the Maintenance button.
2. Click the Refresh Links button.
This updates the records with the latest link information such as newly
orphaned pages.
3. Click the Clean Database button.
This ensures that all the database records are up-to-date.
Your database is now clean, refreshed, and is feeling great!
252
Part III: Jumping to Light Speed with DotNetNuke 

Exporting and Importing Wiki Web Sites
You can create as many Wiki Web Sites as you like by repeating the steps in
the “Creating a Wiki Site” section, earlier in this chapter. Each new Wiki
requires a new Wiki module to be set to display it. To kick-start a new Wiki,
you can export data from an existing Wiki and import it into your new Wiki.
Here’s how to perform an export and import of Wiki content:
1. Go to the Wiki that you want to export content from.
2. Click the Maintenance button.
It is best to perform maintenance on your Wiki before continuing to 
Step 2. This ensures that you have an optimum database for importing.
See the preceding section for details.
3. Click the Save Pages button and save the file to your computer.
This creates and displays the wikidata.ZIP file for you to save.
4. Go to the Wiki that you want to import content to.
5. Click the Maintenance button.
6. Click the Browse button and select the wikidata.ZIP file.
7. Click the Load Pages button.
This loads the saved pages into this Wiki.
8. (Optional.) Click the Rake Versions button if you want to use only the
current version of the imported Wiki content.
This optional step deletes all prior versions of the Wiki in the new Wiki.

Getting Under 
the Hood

In This Part . . .
T
his Part is for readers who want to delve deeper into
customizing, personalizing, and improving the experi-
ence of users. It explains how to customize the wording of
automated e-mail messages sent out by DNN, how to enable
users to change the language of some site content, and
ways to customize the registration and login experience.
This Part also demonstrates how to undertake routine
maintenance and support activities for your Web site.

Chapter 9
Standard Stuff You Can Customize
In This Chapter
 Enabling Search on your site
 Personalizing your e-mail notifications
 Changing your Terms of Use policy
 Changing your default language
I
n this chapter, you find out how to customize some of the features of DNN.
This includes setting up how you want your users to be able to search
your site. You can do things like limit the size of the words they can search
for and allow them to search for numbers. We also talk about the Language
Editor and how you can use it to modify all sorts of messages and e-mails.
DNN has a huge worldwide following and a large number of non-English–
speaking users, so DNN developed a system that allows the users to see
some parts of DNN sites in their own language. Any piece of text that is part
of DNN and not “content” can be switched to one of about 50 languages. Let’s
get down to it and see how to customize your DNN Web site!
Finding Things with Search 
Input and Search Results
Internet surfers are an impatient bunch. They want information and answers,
and they want them now. If they can’t find things easily on your Web site,
they will probably go elsewhere for them. These quick clickers appreciate
having access to an intelligent search function to hunt out what they seek.
Aren’t you lucky that DNN includes just what you need to provide easy
searching?
DNN has a built-in search function that searches all the content of your Web
site. This is a skin element that is included in most site skins. The standard
DNN skin displays a search box in the top-right corner of all pages, as shown
in Figure 9-1.

Setting up Search
You must have host access to set up the search options for your Web site. If
you only have Administrator access, your host should have already done this
for you.
Here’s how to set up the search function on your Web site:
1. Navigate to the Host➪Search Admin page.
This displays the different settings for Search results. The Host has the
ability to change these default settings for all Web sites in this DNN
installation. The Administrator can, however, manage these settings on
their Web site without needing host access. See “Changing the format of
Search results” for more details.
2. Set the Maximum Word Length.
This option allows you to set how long a word can be that is searched
on. If you only want your users to be able to search on words with less
than 7 characters, enter 7 here. The default is no maximum if you leave
this empty.
3. Set the Minimum Word Length.
This value is usually set to 3 or 4. If you set it to 1 or 2, your users can
search on words like a, I, or is and will not generate meaningful results.
Setting it to a higher value allows you to help them get a better search
result. Doing this also makes the searching a lot more efficient. Your
search indexing, which we discuss later in this chapter, will have fewer
results, thus will work faster and give better search results.
Figure 9-1:

Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

4. Include Common Words.
This value is set to False by default, which prevents words like “the,”
“was,” and other common words from being included in the search
indexing process. Again, this makes your search results more relevant
and efficient.
5. Include Numbers.
For the same reasons as that for not including common words, the option
to exclude numbers from the search indexing process is available.
6. Click the Update link.
Save your settings by clicking the Update link.
7. Click the Re-Index Content link.
This does some magic that enables all the content on your Web site to
be found when you use the Search box.
DNN is scheduled to reindex the content on your Web site for searching
every thirty minutes. You can manage this scheduled task under Host➪
Schedule, as discussed in Chapter 6.
Adding more Search Input and 
Search Results modules
As well as the global search that can be included in the skin of your Web site,
DNN also has Search Input and Search Results modules that you can add to
any page of your Web site. By adding these modules to a page, you can add
searching to your Web site if the skin you’re using doesn’t have the search
box included.
Here’s how to add more Search Input and Search Results modules to your
Web site:
1. Add a Search Input module to a page.
This module is now ready to use. Results are displayed on the default
Search Results page and have the same format as is set on this page.
Read on to find out how to set results to appear in a different search
results page. You can see how to add a module in Chapter 3.
2. Add a Search Results module to the page.
3. Select Settings from the Search Input module menu.
This displays the Module Settings for this Search Input module.
259
Chapter 9: Standard Stuff You Can Customize

4. Click the Maximize button beside Search Input Settings.
This displays the Search Input settings for this module.
5. Select the page name where the Search Results module is located
from the Search Results Module drop-down box.
This field lists the location of all Search Results modules on the Web
site. The default search results page is named Search Results.
6. Click Update.
Searches made with this Search Input module are displayed in the
selected Search Results module.
Changing the format of Search results
The Administrator can modify search result settings such as the length of the
title, the number of results, and more. Here’s how to change the search
results:
1. Enter search text into a Search text box and then click the Search link
or the Go button.
This displays the Search Results page associated with the Search Input
module you used.
2. Select Settings from the Search Results module menu.
This displays the module settings for the Search Results module.
3. Click the Maximize button beside Search Results Settings.
This displays the search results settings that you can change.
4. Enter the maximum number of results to be displayed in the
Maximum Search Results text box, as shown in Figure 9-2.
The most relevant results are displayed first, so limiting results to, say,
ten displays the ten most relevant results. Leave this field blank if all
results should be displayed.
5. Enter the number of results to be displayed on one page in the Results
Per Page text box.
DNN automatically adds page navigation to search results. This means if
you set this field to 20 and a search returns 30 results, links to get to the
other 10 results are displayed. Leave this field blank to use the default
setting, which is 10.
260
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

6. Enter the maximum number of characters for each title length into the
Maximum Title Length text box.
The module title is displayed as the title on each result. Leave this field
blank to have no maximum title length, which is the default setting.
7. Enter the maximum number of characters for each description into
the Maximum Description Length text box.
The module content is displayed as the description on each result.
Leave this field blank to have no maximum description length, which is
the default setting.
8. Check the Show Description check box to display a description for
each result.
Alternatively, uncheck this option to hide the description.
9. Click the Update link to save the settings.
Do a test search to see how the new settings have changed the results.
Inviting Authentication 
with Account Login
The standard method of logging in to a DNN Web site involves the user click-
ing the Login link that is standard in most DNN skins, and then entering their
username and password. But DNN also offers a number of quick and easy
ways for an Administrator to change this standard procedure to make it more
enticing to log in, which we cover in this section.
Figure 9-2:

261
Chapter 9: Standard Stuff You Can Customize

Adding an Account Login module
Encourage users to log in by adding an Account Login module to a page.
Having the Account Login module on a page reminds existing users to log in
and can encourage new visitors to register on your Web site. Simply add 
an Account Login module to any page, and it is ready to use without any 
configuration.
Here are three simple ideas to customize your account Login module:
 Add a module header or module footer to an Account Login module to
communicate a login message to users.
 Set the module to appear on all pages to really drive the login message
home.
 Change the View Permissions module setting to be viewable only to
Unauthenticated users. This means the module disappears when they
are logged in. This is a nice personal touch that gives you back valuable
page space.
Creating a unique login page
Most DNN skins include a Login link that displays the default User Login page
for the Web site. This page displays an Account Login module and nothing
else. You can’t add other modules to this page; however, if you do want to
jazz up the login page, you can create your own login page and set it as the
login page for your Web site.
Here’s how to create your own login page:
1. Add a new page, setting the permissions to View Page to All Users.
Name the page title something easy to remember, like Login or Account
Login.
2. Add an Account Login module to this page, as shown in Figure 9-3.
This step is really, really important! If you don’t add an Account Login
module to this page or don’t have one that is available to unauthenti-
cated users on another page, nobody will be able to log in to the Web
site, including you!
3. Pretty the page up however you like.
Add friendly instructions, nice pictures, and any other stuff to jazz the
page up the way you like it.
262
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

4. Navigate to the Admin➪Site Settings page.
This takes you to the settings page for this Web site.
5. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings.
This displays the advanced settings for this Web site.
6. Select the name of the page you created in Step 1 from the Login Page
drop-down box.
This changes the login page from the default one to your page. Selecting
<None Specified> switches it back to the default page.
7. Click the Update link.
The new page is now displayed when the Login link is clicked.
Personalizing with User Account
The standard method of registering as a member on a DNN Web site involves
the user clicking on the Register link, which is standard in most DNN skins,
entering their preferred user information, and then clicking the Register link.
They are then able to log in to your Web site and access content that is only
available to registered users. As the Administrator, you can modify this
process by changing a few simple settings.
The User Account page accessed by the Register link has only a User Account
module on it and nothing else. You can’t add other modules to this page, but
you can create your own User Account page and set it as the User page for
the Web site.
Figure 9-3:

module to

263
Chapter 9: Standard Stuff You Can Customize

Here’s how to create your own user account page:
1. Add a new page.
Name the page title something easy to remember, such as User Account.
2. Add a User Account module to this page.
3. Pretty the page up however you like.
Add text and images to customize this page. Information such as why
they should register, what they will have access to as a member, or some
pictures of happy people is a good start.
4. Navigate to the Admin➪Site Settings page.
This takes you to the settings page for this Web site.
5. Click the Maximize button beside Advanced Settings.
This displays the advanced settings for this Web site.
6. Select the name of the page you created at Step 1 from the User page
drop-down box.
This changes the user page from the default one to your new page.
Selecting <None Specified> switches it back to the default page.
7. Click the Update link.
The new page will now be displayed when the Register link is clicked.
Information that you add to this page that is designed to entice users to
Register should have their View Page permissions set to Unauthenticated
Users. This is a good idea because your users also access this page when
they want to update their information by clicking on their name after they
have logged in. If they are already registered users, you don’t need to encour-
age them to register! Try it out and see what happens.
Personalizing Your E-Mail Notifications
When new and existing users undertake certain activities such as registra-
tion, requesting a password reminder, or updating their account, DNN auto-
matically sends a notification message to their e-mail address. Similarly, when
an Administrator performs certain administrative tasks such as adding a user
to a security role or unregistering a user, they can choose to send a notifica-
tion e-mail to that person. DNN comes with standard e-mail messages that
save you from having to write them yourself; however, you can change the
wording of any of these messages if you like and also add logos and other
personal touches, as shown in Figure 9-4.
264
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

You can change e-mail notifications and other messages under either the
Admin or Host areas. Changing a message under Host updates the default
message for all Web sites. Changing a message under Admin updates the mes-
sage for that Web site only. Changing a message under Host won’t override
changes made by the Admin, so you don’t have to worry about losing
changes.
Changing the Registration e-mail message
As discussed in Chapter 4, DNN offers three different ways you can set up
your user registration: Public, Private, or Verified. Each has a different e-mail
message, so you need to verify how you have set up your registration to
ensure that you change the correct registration e-mail message.
Here’s how to change the e-mail message sent to users who register on your
Web site:
1. Navigate to the Admin➪Languages page.
As well as managing the languages used on your Web site, which we dis-
cuss in the upcoming section, “Changing Your Default Language,” this
area gives you access to manage all the notification e-mail messages for
your Web site.
Figure 9-4:
The
Registration

users upon
registration.
265
Chapter 9: Standard Stuff You Can Customize

2. Select Language Editor from the Languages module menu.
This takes you to the Language Editor where you can view the notifica-
tion messages.
3. If your registration is set up as Public, locate the User Registration
message titled Resource Name: EMAIL_USER_REGISTRATION_PUBLIC_
BODY.Text in the list of Resources on the right side of the page.
The user registration e-mail messages are located about halfway down
the list. If your user registration isn’t set for public registration, you will
need to change either the Resource Name: EMAIL_USER_REGISTRATION_
PRIVATE_BODY.Text, or the Resource Name: EMAIL_USER_REGISTRATION_
VERIFIED_BODY.Text messages instead.
The Resource Names of e-mail notifications and other messages are 
capitalized to make them easier to find.
4. Click the Maximize button beside Default Value, shown in Figure 9-5,
to view the current message.
The message includes text inside square brackets ([]). When the mes-
sage is sent, these are replaced with the correct information for that
user. For example, [User:FullName] is replaced with the user’s full name.
5. Click the arrow button beside Default Value to edit the current 
message.
This displays a message saying that all unsaved changes will be lost if
you continue, and asking if you’re sure you want to continue. The only
date you will lose is anything you have typed into the text boxes on this

Changing Your Terms of Use Policy
Depending on the skin used on your Web site, it may provide links enabling
visitors to view the Terms of Use and Privacy policy for the Web site. DNN
comes with standard Terms and Privacy messages; however, you need to
update these to reflect your true policy.
Here’s how to change the Terms of Use message on your Web site:
1. Navigate to the Admin➪Languages page.
As well as managing the languages used on your Web site, which we 
discuss in the section, “Changing Your Default Language,” this area gives
you access to managing all the notification e-mail messages for your
Web site.
2. Select Language Editor from the Languages module menu.
This takes you to the Language Editor, where you can view the notifica-
tion messages.
3. Locate the User Registration message titled Resource Name: MESSAGE_
PORTAL_TERMS.Text in the list of Resources on the right side of the
page.
4. Click the Maximize button beside Default Value to view the current
message.
The message includes text inside square brackets ([]). When the mes-
sage is sent, the brackets are replaced with the correct information for
that user. For example, [Portal:PortalName] is replaced with the name of
your Web site.
269

Changing Your Default Language
Modifying the languages on a DNN Web site does not interpret all the content
within the modules on your Web site into the chosen language. It’s a fabulous
idea, but it’s not what you should expect.
What you can do is to make your Web site more accessible and user friendly
by enabling users to read certain Web site information in their preferred lan-
guage, as shown in Figure 9-6. The information that changes is everything
apart from the content you add. This includes skin tokens such as Date and
Terms of Use, the field names on the Admin and Host page, and the field
names on the Add and Edit pages for modules and pages. (Big thanks to the
DNN community members who have voluntarily produced and shared lan-
guage interpretations for DNN!)
Adding a language
Before you can add a language to your Web site, you need to find an interpre-
tation for the language you want. The best place to find interpretations is on
the DotNetNuke Web site. Look under Community➪Languages. Here you will
find a list of Language Packs. Download the language you require and then
you are ready to add it to your Web site.

Here’s how to add a new language to your Web site:
1. Log in as the Host.
Host access is required to add a new language to a Web site.
2. Navigate to the Host➪Languages page.
This takes you to the Languages page, where you can add languages that
will then be available on all Web sites.
3. Select Install Language Pack from the Languages module menu.
This takes you to the Upload Language Pack page and lets you upload
the Language pack to this Web site.
4. Click the Browse button and select a Language Pack that you have
downloaded.
The name of the Language Pack will be something like ResourcePack.
Full.03.01.01.en-AU.zip. If you don’t have a Language Pack, read the 
introduction to this tutorial.
5. Click the Save File link.
This decompresses the file and uploads it to the Web site.
6. Click the Return link.
This takes you back to the Languages page. The new language is listed
as Enabled in the Supported Locales list. You can Enable or Disable a
language here at any time.
Now that you have more than one language installed on your site, you may
decide to disable the other language. Disabling a language means that your
users can no longer select that language as their preferred language in their
profile.
To disable a language follow these steps:
1. Log in as the Admin.
2. Navigate to the Admin➪Languages page.
This takes you to the Languages page for your site where you can 
disable a language.
3. Click the Disable link.
This makes the language unavailable to your users. You can re-enable by
clicking the Enable link.

 Checking your stats with the Site Log
 See what’s happening with the Log Viewer
 Emptying your Recycle Bin
 Automating stuff with scheduled tasks
A
s part of the upkeep and maintenance of your Web site, you should
make use of the instruments in DotNetNuke that let you keep your
finger on the pulse. These simple-to-use tools let you know who is visiting
your site, keep you in touch with what’s happening behind the scenes, and
allow you to clean up after accidents.
As with anything in life, a little bit of maintenance on a regular basis prevents
bigger problems later on. For example, when was the last time you emptied
the Recycle Bin on your computer? If it’s been a while, you’ll find that if you
try to find a file that needs to be recovered, you have mountains of files to
look through. A regular cleanup of the Recycle Bin makes it easy to find that
file. It’s the same with your Web site. The monitoring tools in DotNetNuke
make it very simple to find out what’s going on with your site and whether
there are any problems that need your attention.
Getting to Know Your Site Log
One of the main things you should know about your site is how many people
are looking at it and what pages they are looking at. This information can
easily be found by looking at the reports the Site Log gives you. See Chapter 3
for how to set the history for your Site Log.

The Site Log has 12 reports that can tell you all sorts of interesting statistics
about your site, such as which pages are the most popular, or how many
pages are being viewed by the hour, day, day of the week, and month. You can
also find out which search engines and affiliates are referring users to your
site, how often individual users use your site, and where people are coming
from. There is even a very detailed report that gives you information on
every page that has been viewed! We discuss each of the reports in more
detail in the following sections.
Creating a report is simple. Choose Admin➪Site Log, which shows you the
Site Log report page, as shown in Figure 10-1. Here you can see how many
days of history a superuser has allowed for your site and the options for 
creating the different reports.
To create a report, just compete these steps:
1. Select the report you want to see from the Report Type drop-down
list.
2. Click the Calendar button next to the Start Date.
3. Select the Start Date from the calendar that pops up.
4. Click the Calendar button next to the End Date.
5. Select the End Date from the calendar that pops up and click the
Display button.
You can copy and paste the results of these reports into a spreadsheet appli-
cation like Microsoft Excel to manipulate and analyze the data.
The Page Popularity report
The Page Popularity report, shown in Figure 10-2, shows you in descending
order how many times pages in your site have been viewed and when they
were last viewed. This is a very important report because it gives you a great

Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

feel for which parts of your site your users find the most interesting. From
this report, you can easily assess which parts of your site your users are
most interested in, which enables you to concentrate your efforts there. It is
also a great way for you to know on which pages you should advertise or tell
people about the new parts of your site.
The Page Views reports
DNN offers four Page Views reports, which tell you how many times your
page was viewed between the dates you select in the Start and End Date
fields, broken up into the selected time periods. If you run the Page Views by
Day report, for example, the report shows you how many pages were viewed,
how many users viewed them, and how many visitors viewed them on each
day. (A user has a user account on the site and has logged in, so the site
knows who the user is. A visitor, on the other hand, is an anonymous user
who is not logged in, and therefore the site does not know who the visitor is.)
Figure 10-3 shows the Page Views by Day report. This report is a great way
for you to find out which days of the week your sites gets viewed the most.
You can then use this information to schedule maintenance on your site’s
slow days, which will keep your users happy.
DNN offers three other reports of this type: Page Views by Day of Week, Page
Views by Hour, and Page Views by Month. Each of these reports can tell you a
bit more about how and when your site is used.

Chapter 10: Keeping Tabs with the Site Log and Log Viewer

The User Registrations reports
The two User Registrations reports give you information on which countries
your registered users come from and when they are signing up. The User
Registrations by Country Report tells you the full name and country of origin
for your users: This information tells you where the content of your site is
most appreciated. For example, if you start to see a lot of users signing up
from Australia, you might consider linking your site to other Australian sites
to generate more traffic to your site.
The User Registrations by Date report, shown in Figure 10-4, shows when a
user registers on your site. You can cross-check this against your advertising
to see how an advertising campaign on a particular date affected the rate of
registrations on your site.

The User Frequency report
The User Frequency report is useful for finding out which users are frequent-
ing your site the most. It gives a list of names, the number of times they have
viewed the site, and the last time they viewed it. You can use this information
to see if people keep coming back to your site, or if they get bored, view a few
pages, and then never return. If your site is sticky (in other words, it provides
new information on a regular basis), you will see long-term users accumulat-
ing large numbers of views and having a recent Last Request date. If your site
is not sticky, you will see many users with similar numbers of views and Last
Request dates that are old.
The Site Referrals report
Each time someone uses a search engine like Google and clicks on a result to
be taken to your site, it is called a site referral. DNN records the URL of the
page that the user who lands on your site has just come from. You can use
this information, shown in Figure 10-5, to find out which of your advertising
campaigns is working.

Chapter 10: Keeping Tabs with the Site Log and Log Viewer

The Affiliate Referrals report
DotNetNuke contains a Vendor Management module that allows you to
manage advertising campaigns on your own site. One of the options you have
available is to create affiliates for your Web site and reward the sites sending
you lots of new customers. DNN allows you to easily track when one of your
affiliates sends a user your way to sign up. Each time a user signs up and has
their AffiliateID recorded, it shows up in the Affiliate Referrals report, as
shown in Figure 10-6.
The Detailed Site Log report
If you want to know exact details about every page that has been viewed on
your Web site, who viewed it, when they viewed it, what browser they viewed
it with, and how they got referred to that page, the Detailed Site Log is for
you. This report, shown in Figure 10-7, gives you all this information and even
tells you the IP address of the user’s Internet connection. This information is
useful for situations where you need to know detailed information about your
traffic during specific time periods. For example, if you believe someone is
trying to hack into your site, or you are getting unusually high traffic, you can
analyze this data to pinpoint what IP address they are using, which you can
then use to track down any evildoers.
This report may take a long time to generate if you select more than one day
in the Start and End Date fields: It shows every page view during the selected
dates.

Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

The User Agents report
Millions of people are surfing the Internet at any given time. These people use
Web browsers such as Internet Explorer (IE), which comes in lots of versions,
including 4, 5, 6, and now 7. They also use browsers such as Firefox, Opera,
Netscape, and a host of others. Knowing what browser your visitors are using
is helpful to you as a Web site owner because each browser works slightly dif-
ferently: A Web site viewed in IE doesn’t look exactly the same as one viewed
in Firefox. One of the things that Web site designers try to do is to create
“cross-browser” designs that look equally good in all browsers. This is not
always economically viable, so it is good to know which browsers people are
using to access your site. For example, if less than a half of a percent of your
visitors are using Netscape, you probably don’t want to spend money trying
to make your site work properly in Netscape. The User Agents report tells
you what browser your visitors are using. Figure 10-8 shows a typical User
Agents report from www.philipbeadle.net.

Chapter 10: Keeping Tabs with the Site Log and Log Viewer

See What’s Happening 
with the Log Viewer
The Log Viewer is your window to the soul of DotNetNuke. You get to it by
selecting Admin➪Log Viewer. This page lets you see what is happening
behind the scenes and gives you an understanding of the health of your Web
site as well as the activities going on. There are many different types of
events you can monitor with the Log Viewer, ranging from when users logged
in to when a new page was added to the site.
The Log Viewer also records when things are going wrong. For example, if
one of the modules on your site has something wrong with it, the error that
occurred will be recorded in the Log Viewer. You can then use this informa-
tion to get it fixed, providing all the details the person fixing it needs. For
example, if you have a module on your site that has not been configured
properly and keeps failing with the same error, you can send those items in
the Log Viewer to your support person. Your tech support person can ascer-
tain that the reason for the module failing is because a setting has been
missed. You can then log in to your site and use this information to correct
the issue. The Log Viewer even helps you out with this task as well by provid-
ing a built-in way for you set the threshold of when you want these messages
sent to a particular e-mail address! How cool is that?
There is color-coding on each of the events that the Log Viewer records to
help you gain insight into your Web site at a quick glance. Errors and failures
are colored red and security issues are black. If you see these colors in your
Log Viewer, you should either investigate further to find the cause or send
those events to your technical support person. In Figure 10-9, you can see the
color-coded legend for all the types of exceptions.
The Log Viewer is available to site Administrators to view the log entries and
for them to send selected entries to an e-mail address. Superusers can also
configure the Log Viewer by adding or removing the types of logs the Log
Viewer records. With the Log Viewer, you can do a thorough health check on
your Web site and ensure that your support team monitors it so that they can
keep an eye on your site in real time.
Using the Log Viewer
The Log Viewer is configured by default to record whenever a particular
event happens in your Web site. When you go to the Log Viewer, you will see
a list of ten events most recently recorded. Lots of events get recorded by the
282
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

Log Viewer and you can look through them by clicking the page number but-
tons on the bottom right of the screen (refer to Figure 10-9). As a regular
maintenance task, you should delete unneeded events to keep the log size
down. You can delete selected items by clicking the Delete Selected
Exceptions button or you can delete them all by clicking Clear Log.
Another way to look quickly through the Log Viewer is to change the number
in the Records Per Page text box to a higher value. If you select 100, you will
see 100 records per page. If you do this, be aware that the page will take
longer to load depending on your Internet connection speed.
If you are logged in as a superuser, you will also see a drop-down list called
Portal. Superusers are allowed to see the events created by any of the Web
sites that have been set up by any user, and the Portal drop-down list allows
you to select the events from a specific Web site. The default selection is All,
which shows you the exceptions from all the Web sites at once. Simply select
the name of the site from the drop-down list to narrow down the list of
events.
Figure 10-9:
The Log

283
Chapter 10: Keeping Tabs with the Site Log and Log Viewer

Whereas the Site Log lets you see who is on your Web site and where they
went and when they went there, the Log Viewer gives you even more details.
With the Log Viewer, you can see when a user logged in successfully and also
when they tried to log in but failed. This is useful for spotting when users are
trying to hack into your Web site because it records the IP address of the
computer making the attempt, which you can later use to track the offender if
need be. To easily see the failed login attempts, simply select Login Failure
from the Type drop-down list.
One of the great things about DotNetNuke is that it enables you to do many
tasks that would normally require a system Administrator. In the Dark Ages
before DotNetNuke, if something went wrong with your site, your users
would get a nasty error page with some cryptic message that was of no use to
you. They would ring you up to tell you your site was broken, but when you
asked them what was wrong, they could only repeat a cryptic message that
told you nothing. With DotNetNuke, on the other hand, your site is still dis-
played, and only the one module that has a problem shows an error message
saying that the module is not available. Now for the extra-cool part: Not only
did DotNetNuke fail gracefully, but it also recorded everything about the fail-
ure that the technical support person will need to fix it. If the failure is from a
module, DNN creates a Module Load Exception in the Log Viewer. You don’t
need to write anything down when your user rings you up and says that one
of the modules on your site is showing an error: Simply say “Thanks,” and go
to the Log Viewer to look for any Module Load Exceptions. After you’ve found
the list of exceptions (or errors), you can send them to your technical sup-
port person.
In Figure 10-10, you can see the message window that makes it very easy for
you to get help with technical problems. To see this window, click the plus
sign next to Send Exceptions. To send the exceptions to your technical sup-
port person, simply select the check box next to each of the items you want
to send, enter the tech support e-mail address, and write a friendly message
about the problems you are experiencing. Click Send Selected Exceptions and
you’re done. Your support team will now have all the information they need
to solve the problem and get your site running perfectly again.
Configuring the Log Viewer
Superusers have the extra capability to change which events are recorded by
the Log Viewer. A default set of events captures the most commonly used
events and you should probably leave these as they are. You can add extra
events to the list by selecting Edit Log Configurations from the module menu.
This takes you the list of current events that are being recorded; if the word
True appears in the Active column, they are being recorded now. If you click
284
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

the Edit link you can also see for which Web sites the events are being
recorded and if the events are being recorded in the standard event log or a
specific event log file. You may want to use a different event log file if you
need to keep a specific event’s log in a separate file. This can be useful for
your technical support team if they are having trouble diagnosing a problem.
To add a new event to be recorded, select Add Log Configuration from the
module menu. The edit page for adding and editing log configurations is
shown in Figure 10-11. To get to this screen, click the Edit Log Configurations
to show the list of current events and then either click the pencil next to any
of the current items or click Add Log Configurations from the module menu.

To add the new event, follow these steps:
1. Select the Logging Enabled check box.
You can turn this on and off to decide which events are recorded.
2. Select from the Log Type drop-down list which event you want to
record.
You can record 47 different events in DotNetNuke!
3. Select which Web site you want to record for in the Portal drop-down
list.
If you select All, every time that event occurs, it will be recorded.
4. From the Keep Most Recent drop-down list, select how many records
of this type of event you want to keep.
After that limit is reached, the oldest events will be deleted and the new
ones recorded. This stops the Log Viewer from getting too big.
5. If you want to keep your Log Viewer records for this log type in a 
separate file, specify the filename here.
Log Viewer records its events in XML format, so the file you specify must
be an XML file.
DotNetNuke automates as much of the management of your Web site as pos-
sible. To make your life even easier and to make sure that you don’t miss out
on important event notifications, you can set up your event to e-mail you or
your technical support team when it occurs. You can see this at the bottom
of the screen for editing an Event Log Setting.
To do this, follow these steps:
1. Select the E-mail Event Notification Enabled check box.
This activates the e-mail sending feature for your event.
2. In the Occurrence Threshold drop-down lists, enter when you want to
be notified.
For example, if you want to be notified when the Login Failed event has
occurred 25 times in 1 minute, which could indicate an attack, select 25
Occurrences and 1 Minutes from the drop-down lists.
3. In the Mail From Address field, enter the address you want the person
who receives the e-mail to reply to.
4. In the Mail To Address field, enter the address of the person who
should receive the e-mail.
This will often be you or the technical support team, depending on the
type of event.
5. Click Update.

DotNetNuke now has a handy utility called the Recycle Bin, which you can
access from Admin➪Recycle Bin. In the early days of DotNetNuke, if you
deleted an item, it was gone. (Ahem: This caused all sorts of problems when
one of the authors of this book was trying to show another of its authors how
to use a computer.) Thus the Recycle Bin was born. The Recycle Bin is
exactly what you would expect it to be: A place where you can go to restore
modules and pages that you deleted from your Web site. Figure 10-12 shows
the Recycle Bin with items in the Pages and Modules lists. As your Web site
starts to mature and you and your site Administrators add and modify more
and more content, the Recycle Bin will fill up with items. You should make
cleaning up the Recycle Bin a part of your regular maintenance of your Web
site so that when the time comes that you want to restore a module, you
don’t have to scroll through hundreds of deleted items.
Restoring a page
When you delete a page in DotNetNuke, it is not permanently deleted, but is
only marked ready for deletion. This makes it possible to restore the page
back to its former glory in one easy step. Simply click the page name you
want to restore in the list of deleted pages and click the Restore button. Your
page is now ready for you to edit and add more content to.

Bin is where

and pages.

Chapter 10: Keeping Tabs with the Site Log and Log Viewer

Permanently deleting a page
To keep your Recycle Bin nice and tidy, you should regularly delete the items
you know you will never need again. After you permanently delete an item,
you are no longer able to restore the page and it will not show up in the
Recycle Bin Page List. To permanently delete a page, click the name of the
page in the list and click the Delete button. Now your Recycle Bin is getting
tidy!
Restoring a module
The same process you followed for restoring a page works for modules as
well. The only difference is that, with a module, you need to specify which
page you want it to be restored to. Follow these steps to restore a module:
1. Select the module to restore in the list of delete modules.
2. Select the page to restore the module to by selecting it from the
Restore to Page drop-down list.
3. Click the Restore button.
Permanently deleting a module
You will find as you use DotNetNuke that the module list in the Recycle Bin
will fill up quite quickly, so it is a good idea to check it regularly and perma-
nently delete any modules you no longer need. The process is exactly the
same as for deleting a page. Simply click the module you want to delete and
click the Delete button.
Emptying the Recycle Bin
A handy tool on the Recycle Bin allows you to permanently delete the con-
tents of both the Deleted Pages list and the Deleted Modules list in one go. All
you need to do is click the Empty Recycle Bin button and your Recycle Bin
will be emptied for you. You may need to click it twice to completely empty
the Recycle Bin. Remember that clicking this button will permanently delete
all items in the Recycle Bin.

Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

Checking on Scheduled Tasks
In a standard DotNetNuke Web site, some tasks automatically occur in the
background. Operations that occur periodically on a regular schedule are
listed here, such as indexing the content of your site for the search facility.
You can view the schedule by going to Host➪Schedule, where you will see a
list of scheduled events, as shown in Figure 10-13. The list shows you which
tasks are running in the background, how often they run, when they are
scheduled to run again, and the history of when they have run recently.
Clicking the History button next to each item lets you see when the tasks
have run, how long they took to run, and if they were successful when they
ran. It is important for the superusers to check this history on a regular basis
so they can spot if anything has gone wrong recently and get an overall
understanding of the health of the Web site. For example, if your Web site
gets a lot of traffic and you have the Site Log set to 60 days, you should also
set the PurgeSiteLog scheduled task to run at least once a month. This purges
old stuff out of the Site Log, ensuring that it never gets too full, which may
slow down your site. As part of your regular maintenance of your site, you
should check the history of the task. If the history is regular, you can be
assured that the Site Log has not become too large. If, however, the
PurgeSiteLog task is failing, the Site Log may become too large for you to be
able to view reports.
Figure 10-13:
The list of
scheduled
tasks lets
you see
what’s going
on in the
background.
289
Chapter 10: Keeping Tabs with the Site Log and Log Viewer

To set the PurgeSiteLog task to occur once a month, follow these steps:
1. In the Schedule pane, click the Edit blue pencil icon next to
DotNetNuke.Services.Log.SiteLog.PurgeSiteLog, DOTNETNUKE.
This opens the Edit Schedule Screen.
2. Select the Schedule Enabled check box.
3. Set the Time Lapse to 30 Days.
4. Set the Retry Frequency to 1 Days.
5. Leave the rest of the fields as they are and click Update.
In the history of a task, you should take a look at the time to execute the task,
which is shown as Duration in milliseconds, and whether the task executed
correctly. Most tasks should only take a few milliseconds to execute and, if
they take longer, will quite likely fail. So when you are checking this list, first
look for True in the Succeeded column, and then check for items over 250
milliseconds. Items with a Duration longer than 250 milliseconds may indi-
cate a problem that your technical support team needs to be made aware of.

W
hen you build a Web site with DotNetNuke, you add modules to pages
to create the site. This is very similar to how DotNetNuke itself was
designed. The DotNetNuke application was designed as a series of individual
components that all work together to create the application you use to build
your Web sites. This design makes DotNetNuke very flexible, and means that,
with a little bit of skill, you can easily change different aspects of the applica-
tion without having to write any code yourself.
Take for example the Text/HTML module: You can edit the content of 
your page by using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. The
WYSIWYG editor is actually a component of DotNetNuke and you will see it in
lots of different modules, such as the Announcements module. Now say that
you want to use a different WYSIWYG editor that has some other features,
such as a spell checker. The component architecture of DotNetNuke means
that you can switch which type of editor you use for editing rich text just by
following a few simple steps, as you see a bit later in this chapter.
There are three types of components that make up DotNetNuke: providers,
HTTP modules, and skin objects. We discuss each of these and show you how
to change them to suit your situation.

Discovering Providers
In its early days, DotNetNuke stored its data in a Microsoft product called
SQL Server 2000 and there was no other choice: To use DotNetNuke, you had
to have SQL Server 2000. Many people in the DotNetNuke community wanted
to be able to use other databases such as MySQL and Oracle, but couldn’t do
it without major changes to the code that DotNetNuke was written in. The
code that DotNetNuke was written in was specific to SQL Server; therefore,
DotNetNuke was tightly coupled with SQL Server. The people who created
DNN wanted to find a way to be able to change which database was used
without having to change DotNetNuke, and this is how the component idea
was born.
DotNetNuke should behave the same way and give you the same features and
experience no matter what database is being used behind the scenes. If the
code that is specific to a particular database was in its own component and
completely separate from DotNetNuke, you could swap it out and change
databases without affecting the code in DotNetNuke. This is called the
provider pattern.
To be able to change which provider your installation of DotNetNuke uses,
you need access to the Web server to transfer files to it and you must be able
to edit the web.config file. The web.config file contains all the configuration
information for your installation. Most hosting companies allow you to have
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) rights, which enable you to edit the web.config
file and transfer it to your hosting server.
Working with HTTP Modules
When you click a link on a Web page, lots of things happen in the background
before you see the next page. The Web server that the site is running on gets
a request and then starts to process that request to produce the HTML that
is then shown to you in your Web browser. Processing the request involves
the HTTP pipeline, which consists of a number of steps, one of which is
invoking any HTTP modules that are configured for the site.
HTTP modules are components that get executed each time someone makes a
request to the Web server by clicking a link or pushing a button. The great
thing about HTTP modules is that they get executed every time. They have
events that fire both before the request is serviced and after. DotNetNuke
takes advantage of this by rewriting the URL of each page so that it is search
engine–friendly.
292
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

HTTP modules are similar to providers in that they are separate components
from DotNetNuke that can be swapped in and out to change the behavior of
DotNetNuke without actually changing any code in DotNetNuke.
You will need the same level of access to change HTTP modules as you need
for providers: FTP access from your host should be sufficient.
Getting to Know Skin Objects
Skin objects are another type of component that allows siteAdministrators to
easily modify the behavior of their Web sites. Skin objects are exactly the
same as the modules you use to construct your site with the exception that
you cannot add them from the Add Module drop-down list. They can only be
added as part of a skin.
The skin of your Web site is made up of lots of skin objects. If you look at a
standard DotNetNuke Web page, you see the date, the menu, the login and
register links, the privacy statement, and a bunch of other objects. Each of
these is a skin object and can be installed on your Web site in exactly the
same way as you install a normal module.
Using skin objects to make up the various parts of your skin means that if, 
for example, you want to change the type of menu system you are using, you
simply have to install the new skin object, change the token in your skin, and
then reload your skin. We discuss how to do this very shortly.
Replacing the Standard DNN Editor 
with the telerik r.a.d.editor
The telerik r.a.d.editor is a WYSIWYG HTML editor that has extra features
beyond what the standard Free Text Box editor that comes with DotNetNuke
typically offers. The r.a.d.editor has several features that the standard DNN
editor does not, such as
 Excellent support for tables.
 Compliance-checking of your content via tools like the W3C compliance-
checker.
 Dockable toolbars, which means that you can move them around like
you can in Microsoft Word.
293
Chapter 11: Customizing the Look of Your Site with Components

 Undo and Redo buttons that allow you to undo specific actions rather
than just the last actions.
 Great support for pasting content from Word. The r.a.d.editor has seven
different ways of stripping the Word markup and converting it into prop-
erly formed HTML.
 Right-click context menus that make it easier for you to create your 
content.
 A statistics view that gives you information on the number of words and
characters in the HTML you are working on.
 A spell checker.
Replace the standard DNN editor with the r.a.d.editor by following the steps
outlined in the next several sections.
Installing the editor
The telerik r.a.d.editor is a commercial product, so you will either need to
buy a copy or try it out with a trial version. These steps show you how to use
the trial version:
1. To get the trial version, first go to www.telerik.com/client.net
and follow the instructions for logging in.
2. After you have logged in, go to the My Free Trials section, where you
will see a list of telerik products on the right side of the page.
There are quite a few, and you can try them all out now that you are 
registered.
3. Locate the r.a.d.editor section and download the r.a.d.editor Trial.EXE
file.
At the time of writing, the current version was 6.6.0, which means the
file was called RadEditor_6_6_0_trial.EXE.
If you don’t want to actually install the editor but instead just want to
get the required files for DNN, you can download the RadEditor_6_6_
0_trial.ZIP.
4. Next copy two files into your DNN project: the RadEditor.Net2.DLL and
the RadSpell.NET2.DLL files.
• If you installed the .EXE file, the files are located at C:\Program
Files\telerik\r.a.d.editor6.5\NET2\bin.
• If you downloaded the .ZIP file, unzip it onto your local hard drive
and locate the files inside the net2/bin folder.
294
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

5. If you are running your DotNetNuke site on your local machine, copy
the files and paste them into the bin folder of your local DNN site.
6. If you are doing this on a hosted Web server, use your FTP program to
transfer the files to the Bin folder of your Web site.
7. You now also need to copy the RadControls folder from the same loca-
tion you copied the two DLL files from.
8. If you are running your DotNetNuke site on your local machine, copy
the folder and paste it into the “controls” folder of your local DNN site.
9. If you are doing this on a hosted Web server, use your FTP program to
transfer the folder to the “controls” folder of your Web site.
Installing the DNN provider
After you have the files for the editor sorted out, you need to install the DNN
provider for the r.a.d.editor so you can use it on your site:
1. Go to www.telerik.com/client.net, log in, and go to the My Free
Trials section to download the provider, which, for version 6.6.0, is
called RadEditor_6.60_DNN(2006_10_06).ZIP.
2. Unzip the file to your local hard drive.
3. If you are running your DotNetNuke site on your local machine, copy
the Bin and Providers folders into the root directory of your site.
4. If you are doing this on a hosted Web server, use your FTP program to
transfer the folders to the root of your Web site.
Configuring the web.config file
The last step is to configure the web.config file to use the r.a.d.editor on your
DNN site. To modify the web.config file, follow these steps:
1. Open the web.config file that is in the root of your Web site.
If you are doing this on a remote Web site, use your FTP program to
download the file first.
2. Locate the <dotnetnuke> node in the web.config file.
3. Inside this section, locate the <htmlEditor defaultProvider=
”Ftb3HtmlEditorProvider”> node.
295
Chapter 11: Customizing the Look of Your Site with Components

4. Change the defaultProvider value to RadHtmlEditorProvider so
that it looks like this
<htmlEditor defaultProvider=”RadHtmlEditorProvider”>
5. Enter this into the web.config file:
<add name=”RadHtmlEditorProvider”
type=”Telerik.DNN.Providers.RadHtmlEditorProvider,
Telerik.DNN.Providers.RadHtmlEditorProvider”
providerPath=”~\Providers\HtmlEditorProviders\
RadHtmlEditorProvider\”
AutoCreatePaths=”true”
/>
6. Save the web.config file and, if you are working on a remote Web site,
use FTP to transfer it to your Web site.
Now when you log in to your Web site to edit text, the editor you will see is
the new r.a.d.editor, as shown in Figure 11-1. Included in the download is a file
called Overview of RadHtmlEditorProvider. This file contains a list of all the
properties you can set on the r.a.d.editor in the web.config file. Try some of
them out and see how it affects the r.a.d.editor.
Replacing the Standard DNN Editor 
with the FCKeditor Provider
The FCKeditor is a rich text WYSIWYG editor that has extra features not
included in the standard Free Text Box editor that comes with DotNetNuke.
And unlike the r.a.d.editor, it’s free! It has many of the same features as the
r.a.d.editor and many more than the standard WYSIWYG editor.
Figure 11-1:
The
Text/HTML
module 
with the
r.a.d.editor.
296
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

To replace the standard editor with the FCKeditor, follow these steps, which
are very similar to the way you install the telerik r.a.d.editor:
1. Download the .ZIP file by going to dotnetnuke.com/
DotNetNukeProjects/ProviderFCKeditor0153/Downloads/
tabid/936/Default.aspx and clicking the Download link.
This takes you to a site called Source Forge, where all the DotNetNuke
files are stored for download.
2. Unzip the file to your local hard drive.
3. If you are running your DotNetNuke site on your local machine, copy
the Bin and Providers folders into the root directory of your site.
4. If you are working on a hosted Web server, use your FTP program to
transfer the folders to the root of your Web site.
Now that you have the appropriate files on the Web server, we need to modify
the web.config file so that DotNetNuke knows to use the new FCKeditor. To
modify the web.config file, follow these steps:
1. Open the web.config file that is in the root of your Web site.
If you are working on a remote Web site, use your FTP program to down-
load the file first.
2. Locate the <dotnetnuke> node in the web.config file.
3. Inside this section, locate the <htmlEditor defaultProvider=
”Ftb3HtmlEditorProvider”> node.
4. Change the defaultProvider value to FckHtmlEditorProvider so
that it looks like this:
<htmlEditor defaultProvider=” FckHtmlEditorProvider”>
5. Open the file called Install.txt from the unzipped files.
6. Copy the section between <add name=”FckHtmlEditorProvider”
and </providers> and paste it into the web.config file underneath
the node <add name=”Ftb3HtmlEditorProvider”.
7. Make sure that your result looks like the install.TXT file.
8. Save the web.config file and use FTP to transfer it to your Web site.
Now when you log in to your Web site to edit text, the editor you will see is
the new FCKeditor, as shown in Figure 11-2.
297
Chapter 11: Customizing the Look of Your Site with Components

In Figure 11-2, you can see a check box that says Show Custom Editor
Options for This Instance. Selecting this check box brings up a new settings
page, shown in Figure 11-3, for the FCK Editor that allows you customize 
the look and feel and functionality of the editor without having to edit the
web.config file again.

Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

Enabling Friendly URLs
DotNetNuke makes it easy for Web site Administrators to add as many pages as
they like to their sites. Each new page that is added is stored as a record in the
underlying database and is displayed when DNN retrieves the TabID from the
URL to work out which page to show. For example, the URL www.dnnangel.
com/Default.aspx?TabID=xxx will show you a featured real estate listing
on the site. The problem with this URL is that it is not human-friendly (that is,
easily remembered by a human), nor does this convoluted URL look good in
printed materials.
DotNetNuke has an option to turn on Friendly URLs, which turns the 
above URL from www.dnnangel.com/Default.aspx?TabID=336 to 
www. dnnangel.com/xxxxxxxx/Default.aspx. The second URL works
really well for search engines, but is still not very useful for humans, and it’s
still way too long to put in the marketing material for your site. What you
really want is a URL like www.dnnrealty.com/FeaturedListing.aspx,
which is great for search engines and easy to remember.
To make Friendly URLs, install a new component called the Inventua
HrefExchanger. You can download everything you need from www.inventua.
com/dnn-hrefexchanger.content. HrefExchanger uses the name of the
page to create the human-friendly URLs. This means that your page names
must be unique within each portal, or HrefExchanger will not be able to dif-
ferentiate between pages. If you have multiple Web sites in your DotNetNuke
installation, you can have the same page name in each of the separate sites.
For example, each separate site can have a page called Home Page without
causing any conflict.
If your page name contains spaces, HrefExchanger replaces them with plus
signs. The plus sign is the default replacement for the space character. (The
HrefExchanger has a “replace-spaces-with” option that you can use to specify
which character to use.) If your page name contains an ampersand (&), plus
sign (+), dot (.), forward slash (/), backward slash (\) or question mark (?),
the URL will not be rewritten because these characters are reserved charac-
ters for URLs. You don’t have to use the friendly name for every page: Its
main purpose is to give you a human-friendly URL to reference in writing,
such as blog posts, and to have a page name that is easy to remember.
To install the HrefExchanger, follow these steps:
1. Unzip the file you downloaded from the Inventua Web site.
2. If you are running your DotNetNuke site on your local machine, copy
the Inventua.HrefExchanger.DLL file into the bin folder of your Web
site.
299
Chapter 11: Customizing the Look of Your Site with Components

3. If you are doing this on a hosted Web server, use your FTP program to
transfer the Inventua.HrefExchanger.DLL file to the bin folder of your
Web site.
After you have the component in the correct location on your Web server,
you need to modify the web.config file that holds your configuration informa-
tion so that the site knows to use the new component. Follow these steps to
update your web.config file:
1. Open the web.config file that is in the root of your Web site.
If you are working on a remote Web site, use your FTP program to down-
load the file first.
2. Locate the < configSections> node in the web.config file.
3. Inside this section, paste this code:
<section name=”hrefExchanger”
type=”Inventua.HrefExchanger.ConfigurationHand
ler, Inventua.HrefExchanger” />
Make sure you pasted the line containing <section name=
”hrefExchanger” directly under the “configSections” section. It does
not go inside the sectionGroup name=”dotnetnuke” section.
4. Locate the <httpModules> node inside the <system.web>
node in the web.config file.
5. Paste the following line directly under the httpModules node so it is
at the top of the list of httpModules:
<add name=”HrefHttpModule” type=
“Inventua.HrefExchanger.HrefHttpModule,Inventu
a.HrefExchanger”/>
6. Now locate the last </system.web> node and paste this line directly
underneath it:
<hrefExchanger extension=”.aspx” />
7. If you want to use a character other than a plus sign + for spaces, you
can set that inside this node. For example, to use an underscore, type
this code:
<hrefExchanger extension=”.aspx” replace-spaces-
with=”_” /> 
8. Save the web.config file and use FTP to transfer it to your Web site.
You need to take one last step to make this component work properly.
1. Log in as a superuser and go to the Host Settings page.
2. Open the Advanced Settings section.
300
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

3. Open the Friendly URLs section.
4. Deselect the check box, wait for the page to refresh, and click Update.
You will notice that the URLs still display as TabIDs; for example, ?TabID=336.
This is because, in Administration mode, the URLs aren’t displayed in the
friendly format. The reason for this is that some third-party modules may
cause problems and you still need to be able to administer your site. If
Administrators use normal DNN URLs, you will always be able to administer
your site with this component installed.
To see your handiwork, log out of your Web site and have a look around.
Click on a menu item and notice that the URL in the address bar is a nice,
easy-to-remember, human-readable Friendly URL, as shown in Figure 11-4.

Chapter 11: Customizing the Look of Your Site with Components

Replacing Standard DNN Navigation
with a telerik Skin Object
DotNetNuke comes with two types of navigation options: the Tree view and
the Solpart menu. Both of these menu systems are included on your Web site
page as skin objects, which are special DNN modules that you can use to
create customized DNN sites. As with most other aspects of DNN, you can
install other types of skin objects to achieve the desired result. In this sec-
tion, you see how easy it is to install a new skin object called the telerik
r.a.d.menu skin object. The telerik r.a.d.menu is a commercial product that
you can purchase from their Web site at www.telerik.com. They also have
trial versions that you can download. After you have registered for the trial
versions, you can download the r.a.d.menu skin object from www.telerik.
com/dnn/Support/radmenuskinobject/tabid/50/Default.aspx.
The telerik r.a.d.menu has several features that make it an excellent replace-
ment for the menus that come with DNN. The code uses Semantic Rendering
to reduce the amount of HTML. It’s tuned to be search engine–friendly but
still remain 100 percent compliant. Also, the extensive use of the keyboard to
control the menus is another factor that allows Web applications to behave
more like Windows applications. The best feature, however, is that you can
easily skin the telerik r.a.d.menu. The menu comes with a set of cool skins
such as Windows XP, Office, and Visual Studio.
After you have downloaded the skin object, follow these steps to install it:
1. Unzip the folder you have downloaded onto your computer.
After the file is unzipped, you will see two folders called net1 and net2
and a readme text file.
2. Open the net2 folder and you will see a file called Telerik.DNN.
SkinObjects.Menu.ZIP, one called RadMenu.ZIP and a skinning
whitepaper.
3. If you purchased a license to the r.a.d.menu and installed the product,
it will usually install to a location like this:
C:\Program Files\telerik\r.a.d.menu3.2. 
To be able to use your licensed version in the skin object, simply open
the Telerik.SkinObjects.Menu.ZIP file and replace the RadMenu.DLL with
your licensed version.
4. Alternatively, if you have a license key for the trial edition, you need
to edit the LicenseFile.XML found inside the .ZIP file in the Telerik.
DNN.SkinObjects.Menu.zip\Resources.zip\RadControls folder. Simply
edit the file and replace the license key with the one for the trial edition.
302
Part IV: Getting Under the Hood 

If you just want to test the skin objects without buying a license, they
will only be accessible from your machine (localhost).
5. Go to your Web site and log in as a superuser.
6. Navigate to Host➪Module Definitions.
7. Select Upload New Module from the module menu.
8. Find the Telerik.DNN.SkinObjects.Menu.ZIP file on your computer and
click Open, and then click Upload New File.
Your skin object is now installed on your site, ready to be used. To use the
skin object, you need a skin that uses it. In the package, telerik includes a
sample skin for you to try out:
1. Go to the skins page (Admin➪Skins or Host➪Skins) and click on the
Upload Skin link located near the bottom of the page.
2. Select the sample skin that comes with the RADMenu skinobject -
RadMenu.ZIP.
3. Click Add and then click Upload New File.
4. After the skin installation is complete, go back to the Skins page and
preview/apply the new skin.
Now have a look around your site with the new skin. You can see the new
menu skin object, shown in Figure 11-5, and how it behaves differently from
the standard DNN menus.

store at marketplace.dotnetnuke.com/default.aspx. The products
sold from this store have been tested and approved to work with DNN.
Furthermore, the profits from this store go back to the project.
Another online store for DNN modules and skins is www.snowcovered.com.
This is an independently owned store that does not offer any testing or verifi-
cation of the items it sells. However, it currently has a large product offering.

Building Forms with Enterprise Forms
A major benefit of a Web site is that is reduces your workload by enabling
people to access information without your involvement. One step better is
the addition of forms to collect data and report on that data. Enabling people
to complete forms to place orders, to register for events, and so on can save
hours of administrative time that would be spent receiving and processing
information.
Enterprise Forms is a highly advanced suite of four modules that interact to
provide everything you need to collect and process data. Enterprise Forms
comes with four modules that work together to enable you to design form
templates, display forms in one or more places, process the data that is col-
lected, and to view or export the collected data. Get these modules and more
details at www.longnhi.com/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx.
Here is a quick overview of these four modules:
 The Form Templates Manager module, shown in Figure 12-1, enables you
to design any type of form you like. You can customize each of the form
fields by adding text boxes, check lists, radio buttons, HTML text fields,
file upload fields, mandatory fields, and more. After you have created a
form, you must create and set up which security roles can view the form,
edit the form, approve the form, and so on. These are called the different
form states, and creating different security roles to manage different form
states means that you can create complex workflow systems.
 After you have created a form template, the hard work is done: The
other three modules are used to display, process, and report on data.
Although the Form Templates Manager module can be a bit tricky the
first couple of times you use it, after you get the hang of it, you can
create complex and highly functional forms.

 The Data Collection Manager module, shown in Figure 12-2, displays a
form that you have previously created by using the Form Template
Manager. All you have to do is to select one of your templates from a
drop-down list and your form is displayed for use.
 The Form Workflow Manager module, shown in Figure 12-3, enables the
Administrator and any other roles with appropriate rights to approve,
reject, edit, and so on, the information that has been submitted by using
the Data Collection Manager.
 The final module is the Report Manager, which lets you export the infor-
mation collected in either a Comma Separated Values (CSV) or as a
Microsoft Excel format. This module also enables you to design dynamic
reports.
Here are some things you can do with this module:
 Create a form template once and use it in multiple places.
 Send a customized message to users after their form has been success-
fully submitted.

 Create security roles to manage different stages of form workflow such
as accepted or rejected.
 Ability to include submitted forms in e-mail notifications.
 Form approval can be managed by selected security roles.

Managing Images with the 
DNN Photo Gallery
Whether you are running a commercial or a hobby Web site, chances are you
will want to display photos. You might like to display your family photos, wed-
ding photos, or pictures of other personal events with your friends and family.
Alternatively, if you’re running a commercial Web site, you might need to share
libraries of corporate logos and branding with your staff, photos of your prod-
ucts with your users, and photos of current projects with your customers.
Regardless of the content, the DNN Photo Gallery module, shown in Figure 12-4,
provides an effective way to display and manage large numbers of images.
The DNN Photo Gallery module lets you create one or more photo galleries
that can be displayed in endless ways on your site. You can set the Gallery to
display thumbnail images in any combination of rows or columns on the
page. Get this module at www.dnnphotogallery.com.
310
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Here are some features of this module:
 Create multiple galleries on the My Gallery page, shown in Figure 12-5,
and assign the ability to manage galleries to different security roles.
 All Administration tasks are managed from the one page, making this
module easy to work with.
 Import any of the gallery layouts you see on the dnnphotogallery.com
Web site with just a few clicks from the Setting Catalog Web page. This
saves you time spent discovering how to design layouts.
 Comes with language support for English, Portuguese, French, and
German. Changing the selected language displays fields in the selected
language. At the time of writing, there were also new files for Dutch and
Russian, which can be obtained from the DNN Gallery Web site.
 Upload a compressed (zipped) folder of images and the DNN Photo
Gallery module automatically extracts all the photos and places them in
your chosen gallery. A great timesaver!

Skinning Shortcuts with the 
ZLDnn-Module Wrapper
Unless you discover a passion for designing skins or have a designer on
standby, every now and then, you will find that the skin you are using just
doesn’t quite provide the unique layout you want. We used to simply make
do with the existing pane layout because we just wanted to keep building our

site and didn’t want the interruption of designing a new skin. However, thanks
to the ZLDnn-Module Wrapper module, shown in Figure 12-6, there is now a
simple and slick solution to this problem.
The ZLDnn-Module Wrapper lets you create a table and display existing mod-
ules within that table, all within the same pane. For example, you could add
the ZLDnn-Module Wrapper to the Content Pane of a page and set it to dis-
play two modules across and two modules down the pane. This gives you a
unique page design in minutes without the hard work of designing a new skin
for the task. Get the ZLDnn-Module Wrapper module at www.zldnn.com/
Modules/ModuleWrapper/tabid/51/Default.aspx.
Here’s a list of features for this module:
 The ZLDnn-Module Wrapper lets you design complex tables, shown in
Figure 12-7, known as nested tables, that allow you to have one module
in the top row, three in the next, two in the third, and so on.
 The table layout can also be changed at any time without losing any set-
tings, making it a robust module.

Here are

313
Chapter 12: Ten Commercial Modules Worth a Look

 Another slick feature is the ability to set all the wrapped modules to
scroll up or down or left or right within the ZLDnn-Module Wrapper.
Alternatively, you can set just one or more modules to scroll. There are
endless combinations available, and experimenting with different setting
doesn’t seem to bother the module at all.
 You can wrap modules that are located on a hidden page; for example, a
page that is set as hidden in your Web site menu.
 Set the height value of the modules to keep the bottom of your page
neatly aligned.
You can’t choose the same module twice within the one instance of the
ZLDnn-Module Wrapper.
Here’s how to get help on this module:
 A comprehensive help document is supplied with this module or can be
downloaded from www.zldnn.com/Default.aspx?tabid=51. This

Online Chat and Support with 
SWIRL (AJAX-Based Chat)
Online chatting usually refers to either a one-on-one chat program or a group
chat, also known as a chat room. Common chat programs include Window
Messenger and ICQ. Online chatting lets your users communicate with you
and each other. It’s a great way to build a community, to create interest in
topics, and to find out more about your users.
SWIRL is an online chat module for your portal. The module, shown in Figure
12-8, is dead easy to use and works exactly like other chat programs, so any
of your users who have chatted online before will feel at home using the
module. Get this module at www.swirlhost.com/Default.aspx?alias=
www.swirlhost.com/chatroom.
As well as being used as a chat room, SWIRL can be used to provide online
support for your users or customers by switching it to operator mode,
asshown in Figure 12-9. This mode sends an e-mail to one or more security
roles when a user enters the chat room. This means that you don’t have to be
logged in to the Web site all the time waiting for a support call.

Designing Pages with the Aggregator 3.1
Aggregation can loosely be described as a way of gathering information from
a number of places and organizing it by using a common interface, which is
exactly what the Aggregator module does. The Aggregator module, shown in
Figure 12-10, lets you aggregate modules into a single module interface and
creates a menu of clickable tabs to select which module you would like to
see. It’s like having a second menu on the page that gives access to modules
rather than to pages.
The Aggregator module provides both functional and design benefits. By
aggregating multiple modules into one module, you can save space on your
page and reduce the need to scroll down the page. This module also offers a
new and attractive way to display information on your site without having to
do any skinning. Get this module at www.dnnstuff.com/Default.aspx?
tabid=207. 
Here’s a list of features for this module:
 The module comes with five different layouts that place the menu or
tabs either above, below, left, right, or in line with module content.
 The module comes with two different color schemes.
 A range of free design themes can be downloaded from the company’s
Web site www.dnnstuff.com.
 You can add existing modules from other pages.
 You can set the module to hide module titles. This means that the title
will only be displayed in the tab menu and not repeated again above the
module content.
 By default, the title of the module becomes the text displayed on each
tab. You can alternatively set the tab title to any text you like.
 You can enter a token (a placeholder) to any tab title that is replaced by
real data on the page. For example, if you add the token [DNN:USER:
FULLNAME] to a title, the token will be replaced with the user’s full name,
as shown in Figure 12-11. A list of tokens is included in the user manual.
 You can download free themes (like skins) from their Web site.

ActiveForums
The beauty of DNN as an open-source project is that many different types of
modules are developed commercially. Some of these module types are also
later developed as core DNN projects. This parallel creates competition for
commercial module developers, who must strive to maintain a superior prod-
uct. ActiveForums, shown in Figure 12-12, is one such product. Despite a free
forum module being available, this module holds its own and is an alternative
worth considering. It is very simple to set up and offers several additional
features to the core forum module. For more information on what a forum 
is and why you might want one, see Chapter 7. Get this module at www.

 All forums within a forum group can inherit the security roles of that
forum group, making it simple to manage.
 Choose from three different text editors for entering HTML posts. Some
editors have fewer buttons than the standard DNN one, so they load
quickly.
 An Alert button enables all users to alert forum moderators or Admini-
strators of profanity, harassment, duplication, or spam in any post.
 Moderator options let you click a button to see who’s read a post and
who’s subscribed to a post.

 The Unanswered Posts button provides a quick list of any posts that
don’t have a reply. This helps Administrators and moderators to ensure
that feedback is given to all posts.
 The Not Read button provides a quick list of any posts the user hasn’t
read yet. This makes it easy for users to keep up-to-date with posts with-
out having to trawl through the different forums.
 The module uses e-mail templates for actions like accepting or rejecting
posts. This saves moderators time and ensures uniformity of responses.
The text of the templates can be changed.
 Details of the number of forum users and forum guests, as well as the
number of forum users currently online, can be displayed on the
module.

Streamlining Content Approval 
with Content Manager
Content Manager is a suite of two modules that provides an approval system
for new content added to your Web site. This is a great tool if you have sev-
eral people contributing content to your Web site and want to add a final
check before the new content is displayed to the world.
The first module is called Content Manager and it lets you create new content
by using the RTE. After the new content is updated, it is added to the Content
Approval module, shown in Figure 12-14, which displays a list of content
requiring approval. People in the approval group can then choose to approve,
edit, or delete the changes.
321
Chapter 12: Ten Commercial Modules Worth a Look

The Content Manager module lets the Administrator create different work-
flow schemes, shown in Figure 12-15, for the approval of content. For exam-
ple, you might create an approval workflow for your marketing department
that requires all new marketing content to be approved by a marketing
person. You might also create an approval workflow for shareholder informa-
tion that must be approved by an Administrator.
Each Content Manager module you add to your Web site can then be set to
undertake one of these approval workflows. This means you can really break
down the workload as well as track accountability for your content.
Try out and purchase this module from www.invenmanager.com/
contentmanager.
Here are some features of this module:
 Set a publication and expiration date for new content. This lets people
create one or more future versions of content which will be displayed in
the module as scheduled, as shown in Figure 12-16. This means you can
create and approve multiple versions of content in advance.
 A one-click approval model that ensures a fast and usable approval
system. E-mail notification is sent when content requires approval 
and when content approval has been given. The recipients of these
e-mails are set by security roles and you can easily change the text of
the notifications.
 A list of tokens (placeholders) that can be added to e-mail notifications
is included. These include adding a link to go to new content awaiting
approval.
 Set the system to save as many versions of each content as you like —
see details like which role approved it and when.
A user manual is provided with the module or can be downloaded from

Distributing Podcasts with 
the Podcaster Module
A podcast is generally an audio or video file that you can subscribe to online,
although it can also be another file format such as a PDF. The cool thing about
a podcast is that after you have subscribed to it, updates automatically
appear in your podcast reader. Podcast information is downloaded to your
computer or your mobile device so you can view it at your leisure.
For example, Scott Willhite, one of the authors of this book, might decide to
write a six-episode series on how to sell your home. Scott creates his series
in MP3 format and releases one episode a week for six weeks. You think it
sounds like good stuff, so you go to his Web site and click on the Podcast
icon. A complicated page is displayed, but all you need to do is copy and
paste the address of this page into your podcast reader and you’re done. For
the next six weeks, you don’t have to go to his Web site to locate the episodes:
They are automatically downloaded into your podcast reader for you to view
whenever you get a chance.
For more information on podcasts and to download podcast readers, go to
www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/articles/podcasts.mspx.
The Podcaster module, shown in Figure 12-17, enables your users to sub-
scribe to a single or multiple episode podcast. The main page of the module
displays any marketing information about the podcast that you enter by
using a Rich Text Editor. Below this, a link to subscribe to the podcast is dis-
played. To subscribe to your podcast, users need to click on this button and
copy and paste the URL into their podcast reader. You add a new Podcaster
module for each podcast you create.
The module has one page where you add general information about the pod-
cast and another where you upload one or more podcast episodes and add
details for each podcast. Try out, read more, and purchase this module from
www.arrownuke.com/Modules/Podcaster/tabid/114/Default.aspx.
Here’s a list of features for this module:
 Create single or multiple episode podcasts, as shown in Figure 12-18.
 Create podcasts of MP3, MOV, MP4, P4U, P4A, and PDF file types.
 List or block your podcasts at iTunes. Listed podcasts will be searchable
at iTunes.
 Podcast categories are based on the categories maintained by iTunes.
When iTunes adds a new category, it is also added to the category list in
the module.

Managing Online Issues Ticketing 
with Help Desk
A popular way to manage customer inquiries or support requests is by
adding a help desk to your Web site. The Help Desk module enables users to
submit questions or requests to your Web site and receive a ticket number
for the inquiry. Having a ticket number gives your users a warm, fuzzy feeling
because they have a reference to quote if they don’t get a response. They can
also go back to your Web site and review the status of their inquiry at their
leisure.
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Administrators or other security roles can then process the inquiry and keep
the user informed along the way through the use of e-mail updates.
Using a help desk is far better than playing e-mail tag back and forth with
your users. All support tickets are located in one central place, shown in
Figure 12-21, and all comments and activities are recorded beside that ticket.
This makes it easy to retrace the history of the item and manage the status of
a ticket, as shown in Figure 12-22.
Using a help desk also ensures that all authorized persons can provide sup-
port instead of a support request sitting impatiently in someone’s e-mail 
box while they are away on holidays for the week. Get this module at www.
dnntoolset.com/DotNetNuke/Modules/HelpDesk/tabid/62/Default.

than ten different fields, including category, priority, date, and status.
 Create categories for tickets; for example, Property Valuation, Property
Maintenance, and so on.
 Create ticket status types; for example, High, Medium, or Low priority.
 Each time an action is taken on a ticket, the Administrators can add the
time taken to do that action. All times are added up to provide an overall
total of time taken to resolve the ticket.
 E-mail notification is sent when an Administrator claims a ticket, when a
ticket is created, or when a ticket is resolved.
 Optional e-mail notifications can be sent each time a ticket has a status
update.

ture. As a DNN user, you benefit from the large number of highly skilled
people who willingly share their modules and other resources for free, for a
small donation, or for a nominal fee. The modules covered in this chapter
represent only a drop in the ocean of the many freebies waiting out there, so
get on the Internet and start hunting!
We don’t want to rain on this free parade, but here are just a few words of
warning: Free modules are wonderful gifts from generous people, but they
don’t come with a guarantee. If a free module doesn’t work the way you
expect it to, don’t complain too loudly! The best thing to do is to visit the
Web site where you acquired the module and see if there is a support forum
or information on how to manage the problem. If not, contact the developer
and, after thanking them repeatedly for their kindness, let them know the
problem. You will usually find people that are very willing to help you.

You can even step up and get involved by testing the module or by offering
suggestions on good features for the next version. Remember, it’s your com-
munity: The more you give, the more you get.
To get you started, check out the Web site of DNN Core Team member Cathal
Connolly at www.cathal.co.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=80. Cathal’s Web
site lists more than 100 freebies!
GoMap
No doubt you will have heard of Google and their fantastic search engine of
the same name. Google recently came up with another great tool called Google
Maps, which lets people view detailed maps of most places in the world.
Hot on Google’s development trail, a DNN company called Bi4ce has developed
the GoMap module, shown in Figure 13-1, which integrates the functionality of
Google Maps with your Web site. Google Maps have lots of great and fun fea-
tures that are available through the GoMap module. Users can zoom in and out
of maps, going from a global map to street level in very little time. Maps can be
displayed as a satellite image or as a street map, or a hybrid of both.
To display Google Maps on your Web site, you must sign up for a Google Map
API. This is a free service and the sign-up process is quick and easy. You will
be given the API information via a Web page, so remember to record it some-
where safe so you can find it again.
The GoMap module has been set up to display a map plotted with a complete
list of your users by country or by name. This information is drawn from
your user accounts and plotted on the map. Plotted points are links to infor-
mation related to that point. For example, when the GoMap displays Country
Online information, each point displays the region, country, and the number
of users plotted at that point. Alternatively, when GoMap displays People
Online information, each point displays the region, country, and a list of the
people (first name and last name) in that region, as shown in Figure 13-2.
Of course, you may not want to display user online information on your Web
site, but this is only an example of how the module can be used. By enlisting
the help of a DNN developer, you can set the module to display any type of
information on the map. For example, your DNN developer could integrate
GoMap with the Real Estate module to plot any of the listed properties on the
global map. Pretty cool, huh?

Chapter 13: Ten Free (Or Really Cheap) Modules You Shouldn’t Pass Up

Here are some features of GoMap:
 Visitors can move to a map of nearly any location in the world and zoom
in to street level.
 The map can be set to display as a satellite image, a map, or a hybrid of
the two. Visitors can change their view.
 Administrators can set the midpoint of the map and maintain informa-
tion for that point. By default, this is set to Bi4ce’s company details.
 The setup wizard, shown in Figure 13-3, keeps this complex module easy
for beginners. Just keep clicking the Next button and you’ll be right.
 Administrators can add, edit, and delete points. This doesn’t include
those automatically rendered from people online or countries online.
 The wizard includes a Find Address tool that provides the longitude and
latitude for a given address.
To get started with GoMap, read about and download the module from dnn.

GoogleSearch
Another Google-based module is the GoogleSearch module, which integrates
the search engine capabilities of Google with your Web site. This means
people can search from your Web site and get the same results as if they had
searched using the Google Web site. The results are displayed in a separate
Web browser and Google Search results are a free Google service, so there
are no hidden costs.
The module can be set to search the entire Web for results, or just your Web
site. Alternatively, you can give your users the option to choose.
Developed by Anthony Glenwright for the Australian-based company Inventua,
the GoogleSearch module, shown in Figure 13-4, is one of a dozen freebies
available from their Web site. Inventua provides their modules on a try-
before-you-buy basis, so you can freely download modules and use them for
as long as you like before deciding if you want to buy them.
Here are some options of the GoogleSearch module that you can customize,
as shown in Figure 13-5:
 Choose from three different sizes for the Google logo.
 Choose the background color of the Google logo to be white, black, or
gray.
 Modify the Search button to display any text you like.
 Modify the size of the text box where people enter their search.
 Choose a regional Google Web site for the results. For example, if you
are in the United Kingdom, you enter www.google.co.uk; in Australia,
you enter www.google.com.au. This is set to www.google.com by
default.

configure the module. These instructions are also included in the download.
A support and feature request forum is provided at www.inventua.com/

MMLinks
The MMLinks module, shown in Figure 13-6, offers two major benefits over
the standard Links module, plus a range of other funky tools. The first major
benefit is the ability to restrict viewing of each link to one or more security
roles. Role access is typically managed at page and module levels; however,
the MMLinks module manages role access to view each link individually. This
means one MMLinks module can be set as viewable by all visitors, but each
user sees different links depending on their security roles. This saves you
time because you don’t need to add multiple Links modules that have many
of the same links, except for a couple of links only available to a different role.
The other major benefit of the MMLinks module is the ability to display the
content to each user in their preferred language as set under Preferences on
their User Account. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean that the module will
translate the content for you, but it does give you somewhere to manage con-
tent for each language.

Search
Options
page lets
you set
whether to
search the
entire Web,

domain, or

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Module titles can also be localized, enabling you to create a different module
title for each language used on your Web site. For example, when a user from
Israel looks at the module, the title might be Shalom; however, for an Australian
user, the title might read G’day.
Here are some features of the MMLinks module:
 The module comes with nine different template designs that alter the
layout of links.
 You can create your own layout templates and include replacement tags
for fields such as username, full name, or portal name.
 The module uses the RTE to add link descriptions, as shown in Figure 13-7.
This means you can add a long description, images, links, and other 
formatting.
 Includes the usual link options to display links vertically, horizontally, or
in a drop-down list.
 Optionally displays an image beside each link.
To get started, download the module and a user manual from dnn.

Daily Comic
Among all these serious and practical modules, we just can’t resist slipping in
a fun module. The Daily Comic module, shown in Figure 13-8, displays a new
comic on your Web site each day. There are over 100 different comics to
choose from, ranging from classic comic strips such as Andy Capp, Marmaduke,
and Dilbert, to popular editorial cartoonists Ed Stein and Larry Wright.

The comics are provided at no cost from the www.comics.com Web site. The
module has been set up to access these comics without requiring any sign-up
process to Comics.com.
There are no guidelines on configuring the module. When you first add it to
your page, it displays a technical message that is really daunting. Please
don’t be put off: All you need to do is select the Edit option and Update to
start displaying a comic.

This module is provided to you by Mike Horton, based on previous versions
created by Francis Noël and David Kafrissen.
Here are some features of the Daily Comic module, which you can access on
the settings page in Figure 13-9:
 Choose from more than 80 comic strips and 30 editorial comics. Many
comics are in full color.
 Choose to enable your registered users to browse through the full list of
available comics and select their preferred comic. This comic is dis-
played to them when they are logged in to the Web site.
 Set the width and height properties of a comic. These override the
default size of each comic but may skew the size of the comic. You
should avoid this setting if users are able to select their own comic as
the size and shape of comics vary greatly.
 Choose to display a link to the comic’s home page on the Comics.com
Web site. The Web site includes information about the comic, the char-
acters, and the artist.
 Choose to display the name of the comic as a tooltip when the user
places their mouse over the comic.
The module can be downloaded from dnn.gmss.org. This page includes
some information about the module and its history.

Multi Page Content
Despite all the fancy modules that you can use on your Web site, it seems the
one that you just can’t live without is the simple Text/HTML module: that is,
until you discover the Multi Page Content module, shown in Figure 13-10,
which is a kind of souped-up version of Text/HTML.
The Multi Page Content module lets you create and manage multiple pages of
content all within one module and one interface.
Each time a content page is created, the title of that page is added to a page
index. The page index is displayed on the module and works like a menu,
enabling people to click on the content they want to view. The use of a page
index on the module means you can manage large amounts of content on one
page without having to scroll down a lengthy page.

Developed by Bo Norgaard of BonoSoft in Denmark, the Multi Page Content
module is one of a small number of freebies they offer.
Here are some of the customizable features of the Multi Page Content
module, as shown in Figure 13-11:
 The module uses the RTE, so you are able to format content, add links,
images, and more.
 Choose to display an icon on the module that enables people to switch
between viewing one page at a time or all pages at once.
 Choose to display the page index to the left, right, above, or below the
page content.
 Configure design elements such the width of the page menu, the type of
rule displayed between menu items, and the font properties of the page
index links.
 The module displays a page index and current page location summary
below module content; for example, Page 1 of 5.
 The module displays a link to the next page below the current page 
content.

TemplatePrint Skin Object
The TemplatePrint skin object isn’t really a module but, as the name sug-
gests, is a skin object that can be used as an alternative to the standard DNN
[PRINTMODULE] skin object.
The standard DNN [PRINTMODULE] skin object for module containers dis-
plays the standard DNN print icon on the module. This enables people to
view a print-friendly version of the module content, as shown in Figure 13-12.
One limitation of the [PRINTMODULE] skin object is that the content is dis-
played for printing without the module title. This means the information can
lose its context.
The Template Print alternate skin object not only includes the title of the
module in the print-friendly version, but also lets the Administrator create a
template to display the content within. This means you can ensure that valuable

information such as copyright notices, the URL of your Web site, your com-
pany logo, or your company details are printed along with the content.
Developed by Vicenç Masanas, a DNN Core Team member based in Spain,
this is one of a small selection of modules and skin objects freely available
from Vicenç’s Web site.
Here are some things you can do with the TemplatePrint skin object:
 Use your own print icon or the standard DNN Print icon.
 Choose a tooltip for the Print icon.
 Display text of your choice as a link beside the Print icon.
 Define a specific skin template to be used to display the new page.
 Define a specific container to be used to display the module in the new
page.
Download and read about the skin object at dnnjungle.vmasanas.net/
MyModules/SkinObjects/TemplatePrint/tabid/41/Default.aspx.
Weather
The Weather module displays a daily weather forecast and is a simple way to
add up-to-date and interesting content on your Web site with very little effort.
Weather reports are supplied for most countries, including Europe and the
United Kingdom, as shown in Figure 13-13. Administrators can choose the
city for the weather forecast, enable visitors to search for weather forecasts,
or display the user’s local weather report.
Each weather forecast displays the forecasted temperature, what the temper-
ature “feels like,” a two- or three-word description (such as sunny, clear night,
partly cloudy, and so on), and an image of the description. The module can
be set to display up to ten days of extended weather forecast, as well as addi-
tional weather information such as wind speed and UV index.
To access the weather forecasts, you must sign up for a free account with
www.weather.com. The sign-up process is quick and easy, and you can
expect to receive partner login and license key details via e-mail within sec-
onds. Developed by Oliver Hine, this module and an alternative HTML Editor
are available for free download.
343
Chapter 13: Ten Free (Or Really Cheap) Modules You Shouldn’t Pass Up

Here are some options of the Weather module, as shown in Figure 13-14:
 Worldwide weather retrieval for almost any location.
 Set the module to display today’s forecast only, today’s forecast and up
to ten days extended forecast, or the extended forecast only.
 Choose to enable users to select the location for the weather forecast.
This information is stored as a cookie, so that forecast is displayed next
time they visit the page.
 Simple search tool for discovering the correct code required to display a
forecast. By entering the ZIP code or name of a city, the Administrator
(and user, if enabled) can search for and select a forecast.
 The module can be set to display a local weather report to each user
based on the ZIP code recorded in their user account. This means that
when they are logged in to the Web site, they will see their local weather
report instead of the default report. This service is only available in the
United States.
 A detailed forecast can be displayed for today’s weather. This displays
the UV index, dew point, humidity, visibility, pressure, and wind speed.
 Hide or show the city name above the forecast or display the observa-
tory location instead.
 Choose to display the weather icons in one of three different sizes.
 Weather temperature can be set to display as either Celsius or
Fahrenheit.

Child Links
Child Links is one of those simple little modules that you don’t need until you
have it, and then you wonder how you ever got along without it! This module
displays a list of any child pages belonging to the page on which the module
is placed, as shown in Figure 13-15. For example: Say you have a page called
Rental Services, which has four child pages called Tenant Services, Owner
Services, Inspection Times, and Document Downloads, respectively. If you
add the Child Links module to the Rental Services page, it will display a list of
links to each of the child pages in the order they are listed.

The Child Links module is one of nine modules available for a small cost from
the www.ventrian.com Web site. Developed by DNN Core Team member
Scott McCulloch, these modules plus a number of skins are available to sub-
scribers for as low as $20. This includes a full year’s access to download the
modules and any updates. At about $2 for a module or a skin, it’s not a bad
value!
Other modules available from Ventrian are the Feedback Center, News Articles,
Quotes, Shout Box, Simple Gallery, Subscription Tools, and two modules that
integrate with the Users Online module: Private Messages and Where Are
They. The Private Messages module enables users to send and receive pri-
vate online messages to users that are online. The Where Are They module
displays a list of who is currently on the Web site and a link to the page they
are viewing.
Some things that you can do with the Child Links module include
 Add a header and footer above and below links.
 Enter a separator to be displayed before each link.
 Customize links by adding HTML styles to the content.
 Choose to hide or display any hidden pages.

YAP Email Manager 1.03
YAP Email Manager is an advanced alternative to the core Newsletters module.
The YAP Email Manager offers three major benefits above the standard
Newsletter module: the ability to simplify the management of newsletter sub-
scriptions, the ability to create dynamic content, and the ability to create
unique mailing lists.
In the standard DNN setup, users must be logged in to the Web site and go to
their user account and subscribe or unsubscribe to a newsletter (security
role) under Members Services. This isn’t very hard, but people expecting
things to work a certain way are easily frustrated when they don’t. What
people expect is to see an Unsubscribe link at the bottom of e-mails, which
they can click on to unsubscribe. This is exactly what the YAP Email Manager
does! An Unsubscribe link is included in the footer of the newsletters, which
will automatically unsubscribe the related e-mail address from that mailing
list. Newsletters also have a Subscribe link, shown in Figure 13-16, that goes
to a Subscribe page for your mailing lists.
Figure 13-16:
Users can
subscribe to
any mailing
list that you
create.
347
Chapter 13: Ten Free (Or Really Cheap) Modules You Shouldn’t Pass Up

Another great feature of the YAP Email Manager is the ability to create unique
mailing lists. The current Newsletter module lets you send e-mails to one or
more security roles; however, if you want to manage multiple Newsletters or
other types of e-mail not related to access to the Web site, it seems unneces-
sary to create a security role just to define that group of users. This is where
the ability to create unique mailing lists is great. You can simply add a role as
a mailing group, or you can create your own mailing list, shown in Figure
13-17, by adding one or more e-mails to it.
Last but not least, this module will (almost) write the newsletters for you!
Newsletter templates mean that the content will be copied from your Web
site and inserted into your newsletter. For example, you might have a module
where you add the latest company news and another module that lists prod-
ucts currently on special. By creating a newsletter template that includes the
content of these two modules, you can automatically send a monthly newslet-
ter that includes your latest news and product specials, as shown in Figure
13-18. You will need a DNN developer to set up newsletters for you; however,
it’s a great time-and-money saver to not have to copy, paste, and format your
content to create a newsletter each month. What’s more, if you combine this
with the DNN Scheduler, you can schedule newsletters to be sent automati-
cally at a regular interval. Look, Mom: No hands!

Part V: The Part of Tens 

This module has been developed by Jason Koskimaki of YAP Club and is
available for free download without any Web site registration required.
Here are some features of YAP Email Manager:
 Choose a test e-mail address that is displayed as the sender of 
newsletters.
 Schedule any e-mails to be sent immediately or at a later time or date.
 Schedule an e-mail that is sent out at regular intervals. Choose a sched-
ule of any number of minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months. Combined
with content templates, this creates an ongoing automated newsletter
process.
 View a log of scheduled e-mails and choose to edit or delete any sched-
uled e-mail.
 View a complete log of previously sent e-mails.
 Preview e-mails before they are sent.

Power Downloads
Power Downloads, shown in Figure 13-19, is a souped-up version of the stan-
dard Downloads module, which offers a handful of additional features.
The module looks great thanks to DNN Core Team member Leigh Pointer,
who is both a DNN developer and designer. Each download record includes
an attractive download button, an image that changes transparency levels
when someone mouses over it, and an animated New icon for recent listings.
The second feature that makes this module great is that you can control
viewing of each listing by roles. Role access is typically managed at page and
module levels; however, as does MMLinks, this module manages role access
to view each download individually.
Here are some things you can do with the Power Downloads module:
 Set the number of items displayed on each page.
 Display the number of times each item is downloaded.

Ten Fun Things for 
Your Forum Users
In This Chapter
 Ranking your most active users
 Displaying user-specific time zones
 Showing the poster’s location
I
n this chapter, we cover ten fun things to keep in mind for your forum
users: everything from updating profiles to letting users rank their favorite
posts. Enjoy! 
Maintaining Their Profiles
Your users are free to share as much information as they like about them-
selves with you and other forum users by clicking the My Settings button,
which has a gear symbol on it, as shown in Figure 14-1. Some of the interest-
ing options here are the ability to choose an alias and the ability to create a
signature that will appear under all of their posts.
The My Settings button
Figure 14-1:
The My
Settings
button
allows users
to change
their profile
preferences.

Administrators can see also these settings for all users and more under
Forum Administration➪User Settings, where they can look up a user and edit
their profile.
Subscribing to Favorite Forums and
Getting Notification of Posts
Users can track all forums that they want to receive an e-mail notification
each time someone replies or adds a new thread. For users to do this, they
simply need to expand the Tracking/Subscriptions section from within My
Settings and expand the Tracking Forum section. After this section is expanded,
users can select the check boxes next to each forum they want to subscribe
to, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Ranking Your Most Active Users
Acknowledge your most active users by ranking them on the number of posts
they have made. You can set how many times someone needs to make a post
to win a first-place ranking, second-place ranking, down to tenth-place rank-
ing. Then when a user has reached the number of posts needed to be in fifth
place, they will get a stars-based ranking image added to all their posts below
their name. When they make it to first place, they get a “ten out of ten stars”
ranking. These settings are located under Forum Administration➪Statistics &
Rankings.
To enable this feature, administrators must first check the Enable Rankings
check box, as shown in Figure 14-3. Another item that can be set here is the
number of posts required to achieve a specific ranking status.

Giving Users Additional Avatars
Create a special logo for your trusted users and one for your moderators.
These logos will become status symbols of leadership and bring kudos to
these people within their community. Here’s how:
1. Select Forum Administration from the module menu.
2. Click User Settings.
3. Find the user and click the Edit button.
Find the user by clicking on the letter in the alphabet that is the first
letter in their first name.
4. Maximize the Admin Settings section.
5. Select one or move avatars.
You will see a drop-down list that contains images already uploaded,
available for you to choose from. If you would like to select an image
that is already in the drop-down list, simply click the Add button. If you
want to add an image not already available, click the Browse button and
then select Upload New File, as shown in Figure 14-4. After uploading the
image, you need to select the image in the drop-down list and click the
Add button.
6. Click Update.

Chapter 14: Ten Fun Things for Your Forum Users

One important thing to keep in mind is that you must click the update button
in order for these settings to take effect. If you do not, the images you uploaded
will still remain available to you but the avatars will not be applied to this
user. At any time you can also delete an avatar assignment by clicking the red
X next to each avatar image shown in that user’s profile. As with the assign-
ing of an avatar image to a user, you must click the update button when 
deleting, or the avatar image will not be removed from the user’s profile.
Enabling Time Zones Specific 
to Each User
Users often like to see dates of forum post information relative to their own
time zone settings. This is managed under Forum Administration➪General
Settings under General Settings. When on this page, administrators simply
need to select the Enable User Time Zones check box. After this is done,
users can change their time zone preference by editing their site user profile,
available when clicking their username in the portal.
Letting Users Rate Their Favorite Posts
Let your forum users rate their favorite threads. Here’s how:
1. Select Forum Administration from the module menu.
2. Click Statistics & Ranking.
3. Expand Ratings and select Enable Forums Rating.
4. Click Update to apply the changes.

Displaying the Poster’s Location
Share the country of all forum users with each other by doing the following:
1. Select Forum Administration from the module menu.
2. Click General Setting.
3. Select either All Users or Administrators from Display Poster’s
Location.
4. Click Update to apply the changes.
Displaying a Forum Group 
on a Different Page
You can add a second Forum module to your site and set it to display forums
from a single group. This means that you don’t have to add and set up a new
forum module each time, which would mean managing forum settings and
users in two modules, which would lead to a decent headache! Here’s how to
display forums from a single group:
1. Add a new page for the new Forum module.
2. Add Existing Forum Module by using the Control Panel.
You need to select the page the existing module is located on and then
select the Forum module. This adds the existing Forum module to this
new page. The module displays all the existing forums and works just
like the other one.
3. Select Module Settings from the module menu.
4. Expand the Forum Settings section.
5. Select the forum you want to be displayed from the drop-down list.
6. Choose to enable or disable the footer.
The footer refers to the Statistics pane and the What’s New pane. If you
plan to add more than one group to this page (by repeating this whole
tutorial again), disabling the footer means you can compactly display
more than one group without having multiple Statistics and What’s New
panes.
7. Click Update.
