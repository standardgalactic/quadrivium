It is a peculiar fact that all the trans-
ﬁnite axioms are deducible from a
single one, the axiom of choice, —
the most challenged axiom in the
mathematical literature.
D. Hilbert (1926)
It is the great and ancient prob-
lem of existence that underlies the
whole controversy about the axiom of
choice.
W. Sierpi´nski (1958)

sermaßen eine einzige Symphonie des
Unendlichen ist.

Preface
Zermelo’s proof, and especially the Axiom of Choice
on which it was based, created a furor in the inter-
national mathematical community.
. . .
The Axiom of Choice has easily the most tortured
history of all the set–theoretic axioms.
Penelope Maddy (Believing the axioms I)1
Of course not, but I am told it works even if you don’t
believe in it.
Niels Bohr (when asked whether
he really believed a horseshoe hanging over his door
would bring him luck).2
Without question, the Axiom of Choice, AC (which states that for every
family of non–empty sets the associated product is non–empty3), is the most
controversial axiom in mathematics. Constructivists shun it, since it asserts
the existence of rather elusive non–constructive entities. But the class of crit-
ics is much wider and includes such luminaries as J.E. Littlewood and B.
Russell who objected to the fact that several of its consequences such as the
Banach–Tarski Paradox are extremely counterintuitive, and who claimed that
“reﬂection makes the intuition of its truth doubtful, analysing it into preju-
dices derived from the ﬁnite case”4, resp. that “the apparent evidence of the

axiom tends to dissipate upon the inﬂuence of reﬂection”5. (See also the com-
ments after Theorem 1.4.) Nevertheless, over the years the proponents of AC
seemed to have won the debate, ﬁrst of all due to the fact that disasters
happen without AC: many beautiful theorems are no longer provable, and
secondly, G¨odel showed that AC is relatively consistent6. So AC could not
be responsible for any antinomies which might emerge. This somewhat op-
portunistic attitude, sometimes supported by such arguments as “Even if we
knew that it was impossible ever to deﬁne a single member of a class, it would
not of course follow that members of the class did not exist.”7, led to the
situation that in most modern textbooks AC is assumed to be valid indis-
criminately. Still, these facts only show the usefulness of AC not its validity,
and Lusin’s verdict8 “For me the proof of a theorem by means of Zermelo’s
axiom is valuable only as an indication that it is useless to waste time on an
exact proof of the falsity of the theorem in question” is still shared at least by
the constructivists. Unfortunately, our intuition is too hazy for considering
AC to be evidently true or evidently false, as expressed whimsically by J.L.
Bona: “The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the Well–Ordering Principle
is obviously false; and who can tell about Zorn’s Lemma”.9
Observe however that the distinction between the Axiom of Choice and
the Well–Ordering Theorem is regarded by some, e.g. by H. Poincar´e, as a
serious one:
“The negative attitude of most intuitionists, because of the existential
character of the axiom [of choice], will be stressed in Chapter IV. To
be sure, there are a few exceptions, for the equivalence of the axiom
to the well–ordering theorem (which is rejected by all intuitionists)
depends, inter alia, on procedures of a supposedly impredicative char-
acter; hence the possibility exists of accepting the axiom but rejecting
well–ordering as it involves impredicative procedures. This was the at-
titude of Poincar´e.”10
When Paul Cohen demonstrated that the negation of AC is relatively
consistent too11, and when he created a method for constructing models of
ZF (i.e., Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice) in which
not only AC fails, but in which certain given substitutes of AC — either
weakening AC or even contradicting AC — hold, he triggered “the post Paul

Cohen set–theoretic renaissance”12, and a vast literature emerged in which
AC is not assumed; thus giving life to Sierpi´nski’s program13:
“Still, apart from our being personally inclined to accept the axiom of
choice, we must take into consideration, in any case, its role in the
Set Theory and in the Calculus. On the one hand, since the axiom of
choice has been questioned by some mathematicians, it is important to
know which theorems are proved with its aid and to realize the exact
point at which the proof has been based on the axiom of choice; for
it has frequently happened that various authors had made use of the
axiom of choice in their proofs without being aware of it. And after all,
even if no one questioned the axiom of choice, it would not be without
interest to investigate which proofs are based on it and which theorems
can be proved without its aid.
. . .
It is most desirable to distinguish between theorems which can be
proved without the aid of the axiom of choice and those which we
are not able to prove without the aid of this axiom.
Analysing proofs based on the axiom of choice we can
1. ascertain that the proof in question makes use of a certain partic-
ular case of the axiom of choice,
2. determine the particular case of the axiom of choice which is suf-
ﬁcient for the proof of the theorem in question, and the case which
is necessary for the proof . . .
3. determine that particular case of the axiom of choice which is both
necessary and suﬃcient for the proof of the theorem in question.”
This book is written in Sierpi´nski’s spirit, but one more step will be added
which occurred neither to Sierpi´nski nor to Lusin, but was made possible by
Cohen’s work that opened new doors for set theorists: “Set theory entered its
modern era in the early 1960’s on the heels of Cohen’s discovery of the method
of forcing and Scott’s discovery of the relationship between large cardinal ax-
ioms and constructible sets.”14 Some striking theorems will be presented, that
can be proved to be false in ZFC (i.e., Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the
Axiom of Choice), but which hold in ZF provided AC is replaced by some
(relatively consistent) alternative axiom.
This book is not written as a compendium, or a textbook, or a history of
the subject — far more comprehensive treatments of speciﬁc aspects can be
found in the list of Selected Books and Longer Articles. I hope, however, that
this monograph might ﬁnd its way into seminars. Its purpose is to whet the

Preface
reader’s appetite for studying the ZF–universe in its fullness, and not just
its highly interesting but rather small ZFC–part. Mathematics is sometimes
compared with a cathedral, the mathematicians being simultaneously its ar-
chitects and its admirers. Why visit only one of it wings — the one built with
the help of AC? Beauty and excitement can be found in other parts as well —
and there is no law that prevents those who visit one of its parts from visiting
other parts, too.
An attempt has been made to keep the material treated as simple and
elementary as possible. In particular no special knowledge of axiomatic set
theory is required. However, a certain mathematical maturity and a basic ac-
quaintance with general topology will turn out to be helpful.
The sections can be studied more or less independently of each other. How-
ever, it is recommended not to skip any of the sections 2.1, 2.2, or 3.3 since
they contain several basic deﬁnitions.
A treatise like this one does not come out of the blue. It rests on the work
of many people. Acknowledgments are due and happily given:

nibalized freely, most of all to Paul Howard and Jean Rubin for their

The Axiom of Choice and its negation cannot coexist in one proof, but
they can certainly coexist in one mind. It may be convenient to accept AC
on some days — e.g., for compactness arguments — and to accept some
alternative reality, such as ZF + DC + BP15on other days — e.g., for
thinking about complete metric spaces.

The Axiom of Choice (together with the Continuum Hypoth-
esis) is probably the most interesting and most discussed
axiom in mathematics after Euclid’s Axiom of Parallels.
P. Bernays and A.A. Fraenkel2
In particular, since the continuum is virtually the set of all
subsets of a denumerable set, solving the continuum prob-
lem possibly requires a more far–reaching characterization
of the concept of subset than obtained above by the Axiom
of Subsets and of Choice. What these two axioms furnish,
may be separated by a deep abyss from what Cantor had in
mind when speaking of s, viz. arbitrary multitudes of ele-
ments of s. One cannot expect to determine the number of
the subsets of s before it is unambiguously settled what they
are.

Everyone agrees that, whether or not one believes that set
theory refers to an existing reality, there is a beauty in its
simplicity and in its scope.
P. Cohen5
Cantor, after creating set theory, left two famous conjectures:
•
the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), stating that every inﬁnite subset of
the reals is either countable or has the same cardinality as R itself, and
•
the Well–Order Theorem (WOT), stating that every set can be well–
ordered,
the latter of these he originally regarded as a self–evident law of thought6,
but later convinced himself that it required a proof.
Hilbert considered these problems as so fundamental, in particular for our
understanding of the concept of the continuum, that in his 1900 Paris lecture7
— without question the most inﬂuential mathematical lecture ever given —
he formulated the conjunction of Cantor’s two conjectures as the ﬁrst of his
famous problems:

This ﬁeld is the theory of sets, whose creator was Georg Cantor, . . . , this appears
to me as the most marvelous fruit of the mathematical mind, indeed as one of
the highest achievements of purely rational human activities. . . . Nobody is to
banish us from the paradise created by Cantor. [Hil26].

CANTOR’s
Problem
of
the
Cardinal
Number
of the Continuum
Two systems, i.e., two assemblages of ordinary real numbers or points, are said
to be (according to Cantor) equivalent or of equal cardinal number, if they can
be brought into a relation to one another such that to every number of the one
assemblage corresponds one and only one deﬁnite number of the other. The
investigations of Cantor on such assemblages of points suggest a very plausible
theorem, which nevertheless, in spite of the most strenuous eﬀorts, no one has
succeeded in proving. This is the theorem:
Every system of inﬁnitely many real numbers, i.e., every assemblage of numbers
(or points), is either equivalent to the assemblage of natural integers, 1, 2, 3,
. . . or to the assemblage of all real numbers and therefore to the continuum,
that is, to the points of a line; as regards equivalence there are, therefore, only
two assemblages of numbers, the countable assemblage and the continuum.
From this theorem it would follow at once that the continuum has the next
cardinal number beyond that of the countable assemblage; the proof of this
theorem would, therefore, form a new bridge between the countable assemblage
and the continuum.
Let me mention another very remarkable statement of Cantor’s which stands
in the closest connection with the theorem mentioned and which, perhaps,
oﬀers the key to its proof. Any system of real numbers is said to be ordered, if
for every two numbers of the system it is determined which one is the earlier
and which the later, and if at the same time this determination is of such a
kind that, if a is before b and b is before c, then a always comes before c. The
natural arrangement of numbers of a system is deﬁned to be that in which
the smaller precedes the larger. But there are, as is easily seen inﬁnitely many
other ways in which the numbers of a system may be arranged.
If we think of a deﬁnite arrangement of numbers and select from them a par-
ticular system of these numbers, a so–called partial system or assemblage, this
partial system will also prove to be ordered. Now Cantor considers a particular
kind of ordered assemblage which he designates as a well ordered assemblage
and which is characterized in this way, that not only in the assemblage itself
but also in every partial assemblage there exists a ﬁrst number. The system
of integers 1, 2, 3, . . . in their natural order is evidently a well ordered assem-
blage. On the other hand the system of all real numbers, i.e., the continuum
in its natural order, is evidently not well ordered. For, if we think of points
of a segment of a straight line, with its initial point excluded, as our partial
assemblage, it will have no ﬁrst element.
The question now arises whether the totality of all numbers may not be
arranged in another manner so that every partial assemblage may have a
ﬁrst element, i.e., whether the continuum cannot be considered as a well or-
dered assemblage — a question which Cantor thinks must be answered in the
aﬃrmative. It appears to me most desirable to obtain a direct proof of this
remarkable statement of Cantor’s, perhaps by actually giving an arrangement
of numbers such that in every partial system a ﬁrst number can be pointed
out.

Let us pause for a moment and try to reconstruct the ideas that led to
Cantor’s second conjecture, restricted to the set of real numbers, and to an-
alyze the relations between the two conjectures. We may try to well–order R
as follows:
Pick a ﬁrst element x1, then a second x2, then a third x3, and so on, picking
xn for each natural number n diﬀerent from the ones picked previously. Since
R is uncountable, the xn’s do not exhaust R. So, after inﬁnitely many steps,
we have to continue by picking new elements xω, xω+1, . . . , xα, . . . where α
runs through the collection of all countable ordinals. Here a serious problem
arises: Not only does the ordered set of all countable ordinals have a very
complicated structure, if considered in ZFC, but — even worse — its structure
is not determined by ZF. There are several models for it with quite diﬀerent
properties8. Our intuition fails to help us decide on the “right” one — if there
is such a thing at all. Our procedure starts to get somewhat nebulous, even
obscure. But suppose that we can do it anyway. What then? There may still
be real numbers left unpicked — and, if the ﬁrst conjecture is false, there will
be. So at least in the latter case, but in general also if CH holds, we will have
to continue with our picking process. How far do we have to continue? This
will depend on the size of R, so here Cantor’s ﬁrst conjecture plays a vital
part. Modern set theorists consider the size of R to be bigger than ℵ1.
G¨odel (1947)9 conjectured it to be ℵ2 and wrote:
“Therefore one may on good reason suspect that the role of the con-
tinuum problem in set theory will be this; that it will ﬁnally lead to
the discovery of new axioms which will make it possible to disprove
Cantor’s conjecture.”
This is indeed what Woodin and other leading set theorists are trying to
do now. Cohen (1966)10 however went even further:
“A point of view which the author feels may eventually come to be
accepted is that CH is obviously false.
. . .
This point of view regards [the continuum] as an incredibly rich set
given to us by one bold new axiom [the Power Set Axiom; recall that
|R| = |P(N)|], which can never be approached by any piecemeal process
of construction.”
8
“If there be two of these postulates neither of which leads to contradiction [which
is indeed the case, provided ZF is consistent], then there are corresponding
to them two distinct self–consistent second ordinal classes, just as Euclidean
geometry and Lobachevskian geometry are distinct self–consistent geometries,
with, however, the diﬀerence, that the two second ordinal classes are incapable
of existing together in the same universe of discourse.” [Chu27, p. 187–188]

1.1 Hilbert’s First Problem
5
In fact the independence results of Cohen and his successors show that
any ℵwhich is not a countable sum of smaller ℵ’s can be made to be the
cardinality of the continuum R.
So, can we well–order the reals by means of the above procedure? Unlikely!
Let us return to Hilbert’s First Problem. In 1904 Zermelo provided a pos-
itive solution to its second part by showing in a 3–page paper by means of a
new axiom, the Axiom of Choice, that every set can be well–ordered.11 This
result brought him instant fame, a professorship in G¨ottingen one year later,
and — created a big controversy about the validity of the Axiom of Choice.
Deﬁnition 1.1. AC, the Axiom of Choice, states that for each family (Xi)i∈I
of non–empty sets Xi, the product set 
i∈I
Xi is non–empty.12
Fact 1.2. For every set X there exists an ordinal α with |α| ≰|X|.
This fact follows from the observation that there is only a set of possible
well–orderings of X. We omit the technical details of a proof in ZF. But
we mention, for later use, that the above fact guarantees the existence of a
smallest such α. This must automatically be a cardinal, thus in the inﬁnite
case an ℵ. It has a name:
Deﬁnition 1.3. For any inﬁnite set X, the smallest ℵwith ℵ≰|X| is called
the Hartogs–number13 of X.
Theorem 1.4. Equivalent are:
1. AC.
2. WOT.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let X be an inﬁnite set (the result is obvious for ﬁnite sets).
By (1) the family P0X of all non–empty subsets of X, indexed by itself, has
a non–empty product, i.e., there exists a map f : P0X →X with f(A) ∈A
for each A ∈P0X. Let ℵ= {α ∈Ord | α < ℵ} be the Hartogs–number of X
and deﬁne, via transﬁnite recursion, a function g: ℵ→X ∪{∞} by
g(α) =

f(X \ {g(β) | β < α}), if X ̸= {g(β) | β < α}
∞,
otherwise

Since ℵ≰|X| there exists some α with g(α) = ∞. If γ = min{α <
ℵ| g(α) = ∞}, then the restriction of g to a map from γ = {α ∈Ord | α < γ}
to X is a bijection. Thus with γ also X is well–orderable.

Observe that the above proof of AC ⇒WOT is nothing but a formaliza-
tion of the naive procedure sketched earlier, where the “picking” of elements
in X is done once and for all by our marvelous and mysterious apparatus, the
Axiom of Choice.
Why the objections?
First of all constructivists, particularly intuitionists, deny the existence of
all things that cannot be “constructed”. E.g.:
“A formal system in which ∃xG(x) is provable, but which provides no
method for ﬁnding the x in question, is one in which the existential
quantiﬁer fails to fulﬁll its intended function.”
R.L. Goodstein (1968)14
However skepticism towards the validity of AC is not restricted to con-
structivists, whose idea of “existence” is decidedly narrower than that of the
majority of mathematicians, leading them to such extremes as the abolish-
ment of the law of excluded middle15, the assertion that all real functions are
continuous, and the claim that there exist real numbers a and b, diﬀerent from
0, such that the function f : R →R, deﬁned by f(x) = a·x+b, has no root16.
Consider, for example, the following statements:
“It [AC] may be true but it lacks obviousness, and the conclusions
drawn from it are astonishing. In these circumstances I think it would
be well to abstain from using it.
. . .
The apparent evidence of the axiom tends to dissipate upon the inﬂu-
ence of reﬂection.
. . .
In the end one ceases to understand what it means.
. . .
In my opinion there is no reason whatsoever to believe the truth of the
axiom.”
B. Russell (1911)17

[Goo68]

W.V.O. Quine comments on this: “The doctrine . . . has led its devotees to such
quixotic extremes as that of challenging the method of proof by reductio ad
absurdum — a challenge in which I sense a reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine
itself.” Note that AC implies the law of excluded middle (see [GoMy78]).

1.1 Hilbert’s First Problem

“The axiom of choice has many elegant consequences, but that is an
argument for its mathematical interest, not for its truth.
. . .
The formal consistency of making this assumption [validity of the Ax-
iom of Strong Choice] can hardly be doubted, but it ascribes to us abil-
ities which I for one am not aware of possessing.
. . .
It is dangerous to claim the existence of an object one cannot describe:
“Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent”, to hijack a slo-
gan (Wittgenstein 1922).”
M.D. Potter (1990)18
Other mathematicians had diﬃculties deciding for or against the axiom, e.g.,
van der Waerden:
“In 1930, van der Waerden published his Modern Algebra, detailing
the exciting new applications of the axiom. The book was very inﬂuen-
tial, providing Zorn and Teichm¨uller with a proving ground for their
versions of choice, but van der Waerden’s Dutch colleagues persuaded
him to abandon the axiom in the second edition of 1937. He did so, but
the resulting limited version of abstract algebra brought such a strong
protest from his fellow algebraists that he was moved to reinstate the
axiom and all its consequences in the third edition of 1950.”
P. Maddy (1988)19
After G¨odel (1938) proved the relative consistency of the Axiom of Choice
by constructing within a given model of ZF a model of ZFC, the proponents
of AC gained ground. Most modern textbooks take AC for granted and the
vast majority of mathematicians use AC freely. However, after Cohen (1963)
proved the relative consistency of the negation of AC and, moreover, pro-
vided a method, called forcing, for producing a plethora of models of ZF that
have or fail to have a wide range of speciﬁed properties, a growing number
of mathematicians started to investigate the ZF world by substituting AC
by a variety of possible alternatives, sometimes just by weakening AC and
sometimes by replacing AC by axioms that contradict it.
All this work demonstrates how useful or convenient such axioms as AC
and its possible alternatives are. But the question of the truth of AC is not
touched, and Hilbert’s First Problem remains unanswered. It is conceivable,
even likely, that it will never be solved20, despite Hilbert’s optimistic slogan
expressed in his Paris lecture: “in mathematics there is no ignorabimus.”

“And whether, in particular, Zermelo’s axiom is true or false is a question,
which, while more fundamental matters are in doubt, is very likely to remain
unanswered.” Russell (1907)

Our inability to decide on such basic questions of set theory, as those
formulated in Hilbert’s First Problem, leads inevitably to the conclusion for-
mulated by Mostowski21 that
“Probably we shall have in the future essentially diﬀerent intuitive
notions of sets just as we have diﬀerent notions of space.”
In some of these ZF–worlds Hilbert’s First Problem will have a positive
solution, in others a negative one.

Choice Principles
2.1 Some Equivalents to the Axiom of Choice
We believe that the ZF–axioms describe in a correct way our in-
tuitive contemplations concerning the notion of set. The axiom of
choice (AC) is intuitively not so clear as the other ZF–axioms are,
but we have learned to use it because it seems to be indispensable in
proving mathematical theorems. On the other hand the (AC) has
“strange” consequences, such as “every set can be well–ordered”
and we are unable to “imagine” a well–ordering of the set of real
numbers.
U. Felgner1
Once this method for unveiling the truth had been discovered by
him, he found it indispensable.
Ivan Olbracht2
Let us start with some familiar observations:
Proposition 2.1. Equivalent are:
1. AC.
2. For every family (Xi)i∈I of non–empty pairwise disjoint sets there exists
a set Y with |Y ∩Xi| = 1 for each i ∈I.
Proof. Exercise.
Observe that the above condition (2) has been introduced under the name
multiplicative axiom by Russell, since it allowed the deﬁnition of arbitrary
products 

ai of cardinal numbers ai.

2 Choice Principles
Though nowadays the proof of the above proposition is a trivial exercise,
this was not the case when Russell submitted his paper in 1905 as the following
quote3 reveals4.
“This axiom is more special than Zermelo’s axiom. It can be deduced
from Zermelo’s axiom; but the converse deduction, though it may turn
out to be possible, has not yet, so far as I know, been eﬀected. I shall
call this the multiplicative axiom.”
Theorem 2.2. Equivalent are:
1. AC.
2. Hausdorﬀ’s Maximal Chain Condition: Each partially ordered set
contains a maximal chain5.
3. Zorn’s Lemma: If in a partially ordered set X each chain has an upper
bound, then X has a maximal element.
4. Teichm¨uller–Tukey Lemma: If a non–empty subcollection U of PX
is of ﬁnite character6, then U contains a maximal element w.r.t. the
inclusion–order.
5. Each preordered set contains a maximal antichain7.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let X be a partially ordered set without a maximal chain.
Then for each chain K in X the set
C(K) = {x ∈(X \ K) | K ∪{x} is a chain}
is non–empty. By (1), there exists a map f : P0X →X with f(A) ∈A for
each A ∈P0X. Let ℵbe the Hartogs–number of X. Deﬁne, via transﬁnite
recursion, a map g: ℵ→X by
g(α) = f(C{g(β) | β < α}).
Then g is injective, a contradiction.
(2) ⇒(3) Let X be a partially ordered set, satisfying the premise of Zorn’s
Lemma. By (2), X has a maximal chain K. Let x be an upper bound of K.
Then x is a maximal element of X.
(3) ⇒(4) Let U be a non–empty subset of PX that is of ﬁnite character.
Then every chain in U, ordered by inclusion, has an upper bound, its union.
Thus, by (3), U has a maximal element.

G.H. Hardy made a similar statement: ”. . . but whether or not the latter imply
the former has not yet been decided.” [Hard06]
5
X is called a chain iﬀx ≤y or y ≤x for any x and y in X.
6
U is called of ﬁnite character provided that A ∈U iﬀevery ﬁnite subset of A
belongs to U.
7
X is called an antichain iﬀx ≤y implies x = y for any x and y in X.

2.1 Some Equivalents to the Axiom of Choice
11
(4) ⇒(5) Let X be a preordered set. The collection U of all antichains
in X is of ﬁnite character and non–empty (since ∅∈U). Thus, by (4), there
exists a maximal element of U.
(5) ⇒(1) Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty sets. Preorder the set
X = {(x, i) | i ∈I and x ∈Xi} by
(x, i) ≤(y, j) ⇔i = j.
Then a maximal antichain K of X has the form K = {(xi, i) | i ∈I}
where, for each i ∈I, xi is a distinguished element of Xi. Thus 
i∈I
Xi ̸= ∅.
Condition (5) of the above theorem can be weakened by replacing preorders
by partial orders. That the resulting condition is in fact equivalent to (5) and
thus to AC is not obvious. To show this and some further equivalences to AC
we need the following lemma that we present without proof, since the latter
would require greater familiarity with the axioms of ZF than we presuppose
for our text; in particular it rests crucially on the axiom of foundation:
Lemma 2.3. 8 If for every well–orderable set X the power set PX is also
well–orderable, then every set is well–orderable.
Theorem 2.4. 9 Equivalent are:
1. AC.
2. The Axiom of Multiple Choice (AMC): For every family (Xi)i∈I of
non–empty sets there exists a family (Fi)i∈I of non–empty, ﬁnite sets Fi
with Fi ⊆Xi for each i ∈I.
3. Kurepa’s Maximal Antichain Condition: Each partially ordered set
has a
maximal antichain.
4. Every chain can be well–ordered.
5. The power set PX of each well–orderable set X is well–orderable.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Trivial.
(2) ⇒(3) Let X be a partially ordered set. By (2), there exists a map
f : P0X →PﬁnX from P0X into the set PﬁnX of all non–empty, ﬁnite subsets
of X with f(A) ⊆A for each A ∈P0X. Let g(A) be the set of all minimal
elements of f(A). Then each g(A) is a non–empty antichain with g(A) ⊆A.
Deﬁne further, for each antichain K of X,
A(K) = {x ∈(X \ K) | K ∪{x} is an antichain}.
If X would have no maximal antichain, then all the A(K)’s would be non–
empty. Thus we could deﬁne an injective map h: ℵ→PX from the Hartogs–
number ℵof PX into PX via transﬁnite recursion by

Y = {(A, a) | A ⊆X and a ∈A} and (A, a) ≤(B, b) iﬀ(A = B and a ≤b in

where each a(A) is a distinguished element of A. Thus X is well–orderable by

2.2 Some Concepts Related to the Axiom of Choice
The last concept [AC] seems to me to be entirely devoid of sense. As regards
a denumerable inﬁnity of choices, they cannot, of course, all be performed, but
we can at least indicate such a procedure that, if we establish it beforehand,
we may be sure that each choice will be made within a ﬁnite period of time;
therefore, if two given systems of choice are diﬀerent, we are sure to notice
this after a ﬁnite number of operations. When an inﬁnite number of choices is
not denumerable, it is impossible to imagine a way of deﬁning it, i.e., distin-
guishing it from an analogous inﬁnite number of choices; thus it is impossible
to regard it as a mathematical creation which can be introduced in arguments.
E. Borel11
The notion that there is nothing special about countability, which is
most pervasive in the works of Bourbaki, makes assuming only that
every countable set has a choice function seem a mite perverse.
M.D. Potter12
Some mathematicians, who reject the Axiom of Choice, still accept some
of its weaker forms, e.g., CC, the Axiom of Countable Choice, or DC, the
Principle of Dependent Choices, while others advocate either all or nothing.
In this section we will formulate several axioms, related to AC, and dis-
cuss their mutual relations. Natural ways to weaken AC are obtained by the
following procedures:
11
[Bor14], quoted from [Sie58].
12
[Pot90]

14
2 Choice Principles
(A) Restrict the size of the indexing set I.
(B) Restrict the nature of the single Xi’s.
(C) Replace the stipulation that one can exhibit simultaneously in each Xi a
distinguished point xi, equivalently: a one–element subset {xi}, by some
weaker requirement.
Procedure (A) gives:
Deﬁnition 2.5. CC, the Axiom of Countable Choice, states that for each
sequence (Xn)n∈N of non–empty sets Xn, the product set 
n∈N
Xn is non–empty.
Procedure (B) gives:
Deﬁnition 2.6.
1. AC(ﬁn) states that for each family (Xi)i∈I of non–empty
ﬁnite sets Xi, the product set 
i∈I
Xi is non–empty.
2. AC(n), for n ∈N, states that for each family (Xi)i∈I of n–element sets,
the product 
i∈I
Xi is non–empty.
Procedure (C) gives:
Deﬁnition 2.7. AMC, the Axiom of Multiple Choice, states that for each
family (Xi)i∈I of non–empty sets Xi, there exists a family (Fi)i∈I of non–
empty ﬁnite subsets Fi of Xi.
Deﬁnition 2.8. KW, the Kinna–Wagner Selection Principle, states that for
each family (Xi)i∈I of at least 2–element sets Xi, there exists a family (Yi)i∈I
of non–empty proper subsets Yi of Xi.
Combining the procedures (A) and (B) one obtains:
Deﬁnition 2.9.
1. CC(R) states that for each sequence (Xn)n∈N of non–
empty subsets Xn of R, the product set 
n∈N
Xn is non–empty.
2. CC(Z) states that for each sequence ((Xn, ≤n))n∈N, each (Xn, ≤n) being
order–isomorphic to the ordered set of integers, the product set 
n∈N
Xn is
non–empty.
3. CC(ﬁn) states that for each sequence (Xn)n∈N of non–empty, ﬁnite sets,
the product set 
n∈N
Xn is non–empty.
4. CC(n), for n ∈N+, states that for each sequence (Xn)n∈N of n–element
sets, the product set 
n∈N
Xn is non–empty.
Combining the procedures (B) and (C) one obtains:
Deﬁnition 2.10. CMC, the Axiom of Countable Multiple Choice, states that
for each sequence (Xn)n∈N of non–empty sets Xn, there exists a sequence
(Fn)n∈N of non–empty ﬁnite subsets Fn of Xn.

2.2 Some Concepts Related to the Axiom of Choice
15
Closely related to CC are the following two axioms:
Deﬁnition 2.11.
1. DC, the Principle of Dependent Choices, states that
for every pair (X, ϱ), where X is a non–empty set and ϱ is a relation on
X such that
for each
x ∈X
there exists y ∈X with xϱy,
there exists a sequence (xn) in X with xnϱxn+1 for each n ∈N.
2. PCC, the Axiom of Partial Countable Choice, states that for each se-
quence (Xn)n∈N of non–empty sets Xn, there exists an inﬁnite subset M
of N with

m∈M
Xm ̸= ∅.
Theorem 2.12.
1. AC ⇒DC.
2. DC ⇒CC.
3. CC ⇔PCC.
Proof. (1) Let (X, ϱ) be as speciﬁed in DC. Then, for each x ∈X, the set
Sx = {y ∈X | xϱy} is non–empty. Thus, by AC, there exists an element
(sx)x∈X in 
x∈X
Sx. Choose an arbitrary x0 ∈X and deﬁne, via recursion, a
sequence (xn) by: xn+1 = sxn.
Then (xn) has the desired property.
(2) Let (Xn)n∈N+ be a sequence of non–empty sets Xn. Deﬁne Yn =

m≤n
Xm and
Y =

n∈N+Yn. Let ϱ be the relation deﬁned on Y by:
(x1 . . . , xn)ϱ(z1, . . . , zm) ⇔(m = n + 1 and xi = zi for i = 1, . . . , n).
By DC, there exists a sequence (yn) in Y with ynϱyn+1 for each n ∈N+.
Assume for simplicity that y1 = (x1), (cf. Exercise E 3). Then each yn has the
form (xn
1, xn
2, . . . , xn
n) ∈
m≤n
Xm. Thus (xn
n)n∈N+ is an element of

n∈N+Xn.
(3) Obviously CC implies PCC. For the converse consider a sequence
(Xn)n∈N+ of non–empty sets. Deﬁne Yn =

m≤n
Xm. Then (Yn)n∈N+ is a se-
quence of non–empty sets. By PCC there exists an inﬁnite subset M of N
and an element (ym)m∈M of

m∈M
Ym. Then ym = (xm
1 , . . . , xm
m) ∈
k≤m
Xk. For
each n ∈N+ let m(n) = min{m ∈M | n ≤m}. Then (xm(n)
n
)n∈N+ is an
element of

n∈N+Xn.
There are many other types of weak choice principles13. Next, we present a
few of these, that play a prominent part in subsequent sections of this treatise.
13
In [HoRu98] there is a list of 383 such “forms”.

16
2 Choice Principles
Deﬁnition 2.13.
1. Fin states that every inﬁnite set X is Dedekind–
inﬁnite14, i.e., allows an injection N →X.
2. Fin(R) states that every inﬁnite subset of R is D–inﬁnite.
3. Fin(lin) states that every inﬁnite, linearly ordered set is D–inﬁnite.
Theorem 2.14.
1. CC ⇒Fin.
2. Fin ⇒CC(ﬁn).
Proof. (1) See Proposition 4.13.
(2) Let (Xn)n∈N be a sequence of non–empty, ﬁnite sets. Then X =

n∈N
(Xn×{n}) is an inﬁnite set, thus, by Fin, D–inﬁnite. Let f : N →X be an
injection. Since each Xn is ﬁnite, the set M = {n ∈N | f[N]∩(Xn×{n}) ̸= ∅}
must be inﬁnite. For each m ∈M, deﬁne n(m) = min{n ∈N | f(n) ∈
Xm × {x}}. Then f(n(m)) = (xm, m) for a unique element xm of Xm. Thus
(xm)m∈M ∈

m∈N
Xm. Thus PCC(ﬁn) holds. By Exercise E 5 this implies
CC(ﬁn).
Next, we present some maximality principles:
Deﬁnition 2.15.
1. PIT, the Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem, states that
every Boolean algebra with 0 ̸= 1 has a maximal ideal.
2. UFT, the Ultraﬁlter Theorem, states that on any set every ﬁlter can be
enlarged to an ultraﬁlter.
3. UFT(N) states that on N every ﬁlter can be enlarged to an ultraﬁlter.
4. WUF, the Weak Ultraﬁlter Principle, states that every inﬁnite set has a
free ultraﬁlter.
5. WUF(N) states that there exists a free ultraﬁlter on N.
6. WUF(?) states that there exists a free ultraﬁlter on some set.
Theorem 2.16.
1. UFT ⇔PIT.
2. UFT ⇒AC(ﬁn).
3. UFT ⇒WUF ⇒WUF(N) ⇒WUF(?).
Proof. (1) See Theorem 4.37.
(2) See (1) and Exercises to Section 4.8, E 9.
(3) Holds trivially.
Next, we present some ordering principles:
Deﬁnition 2.17.
1. OP, the Ordering Principle, states that every set can
be linearly ordered.
14
Dedekind–inﬁnite is sometimes abbreviated as D–inﬁnite. Likewise Dedekind–
ﬁnite (i.e., not Dedekind–inﬁnite) is sometimes abbreviated as D–ﬁnite. Cf.
Deﬁnition 4.1 and Proposition 4.2.

2.2 Some Concepts Related to the Axiom of Choice
17
2. OEP, the Order Extension Principle, states that every partial order rela-
tion on a set can be enlarged to a linear order relation.
Theorem 2.18.
1. UFT ⇒OEP.
2. OEP ⇒OP.
3. KW ⇒OP.
4. OP ⇒AC(ﬁn).
Proof. (1) and (2): See Proposition 4.39.
(3) See Proposition 4.40.
(4) Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty ﬁnite sets. Order X = 
i∈I
Xi
linearly. Then each Xi has a smallest element xi w.r.t. this order. Thus
(xi)i∈I ∈
i∈I
Xi.
Besides conditions weaker than AC there are stronger ones. Let us mention
the following:
Deﬁnition 2.19.
1. GCH, the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, states
that for inﬁnite cardinals a and b the inequalities a ≤b < 2a imply a = b.
2. AH, the Aleph–Hypothesis, states that 2ℵα = ℵα+1 for each ordinal α.
The following result, though interesting, we present without proof, since
even the special forms of GCH resp. AH, namely
CH,
the Continuum Hypothesis:
ℵ0 ≤b < 2ℵ0 ⇒ℵ0 = b,
resp. AH(0), the Special Aleph–Hypothesis: ℵ1 = 2ℵ0,
are generally supposed to be false.
Theorem 2.20.
1. GCH ⇒AC.
2. AH ⇒AC.
3. GCH ⇔AH.
Proof. (1) See [Sie47], [Spe54].
(2) Immediate from Theorem 2.4, since AH implies that the power set of
each well–orderable set is well–orderable.
(3) Immediate from (1) and (2), since by Theorem 1.4 each set is well–
orderable and thus each cardinal is an Aleph15.
Observe that CH and AH(0) are not equivalent. See Section 7.2.
Observe further that the existence of suﬃciently many strongly inaccessi-
ble cardinals also implies AC16. However, a discussion of such phenomena is
beyond the scope of this book.

3.1 Hidden Choice
Experience gained presenting the contents of this paper before a
learned audience discloses that the wily, attentive listener will ex-
pend more energy searching for the possible hidden presence of the
axiom of choice in the proofs than he will in following the positive,
constructive aspects of these proofs.
W.W. Comfort1
It is a historic irony that many of the mathe-
maticians who later opposed the Axiom of Choice had
used it implicitly in their own researches.
Gregory H. Moore2
The use of the Axiom of Choice is sometimes hidden, and, even if obvi-
ous to the expert, may elude the novice. Even several of those mathematicians
who rejected AC used it unconsciously. Hardy3 pointed out that Borel, though
strongly objecting to the use of AC for uncountable indexing sets4, used it
for an indexing set of cardinality 2ℵ0 in his proof that there exist continuous
functions f : R →R which cannot be represented as double series of polynomi-
als. Sierpi´nski5 demonstrated that Lebesgue, another outspoken critic of AC,
used it to show that countable unions of measurable sets of reals are again
measurable. And Moore6 exhibited a plethora of examples demonstrating that
“future critics of the Axiom [of Choice] where freely employing sequences of
arbitrary choices in real analysis before Zermelo’s proof appeared.”

Here follows an instructive example of a proof that appears to be construc-
tive, but is not:
Statement 3.1. Countable unions of countable sets are countable.
Proof. Let X = 
n∈N
Xn be a countable union of countable sets Xn. Assume,
without loss of generality, that the Xn’s are pairwise disjoint. Since the Xn’s
are countable they can be written in the form
Xn = {xi
n | i ∈N} = {x0
n, x1
n, x2
n, . . .}.

Thus X is countable.
Discussion: Once the Xn’s are expressed in the form Xn = {xi
n | i ∈N},
the remainder of the above proof is constructive indeed. However, there are
many ways to express each Xn in the above form, i.e., as a counted set instead
of a countable set. Thus the above proof uses CC, the Axiom of Countable
Choice.
Let us analyze the situation in more detail by introducing some deﬁnitions
ﬁrst:

3.1 Hidden Choice
23
Deﬁnition 3.2.
1. CUT, the Countable Union Theorem, states that count-
able unions of at most countable sets are at most countable.
2. CUT(R) states that countable unions of at most countable subsets of R
are at most countable.
3. CUT(ﬁn) states that countable unions of ﬁnite sets are at most countable.
4. CUT(2) states that countable unions of 2–element sets are at most count-
able.
Then the proof given for Statement 3.1 yields:
Proposition 3.3. CC implies CUT.
The next diagram illustrates further relations between the above and some
closely related concepts: note that none of the single–headed arrows A →B,
with the possible exception of “Lebesgue measure is countably additive →R
is not a countable union of countable sets” is an equivalence.
Note further that none of the conditions entering the diagram holds in
ZF. In particular there exist models of ZF in which R is a countable union
of countable sets7, and models of ZF in which a countable union of certain
2–element sets is uncountable8.
The proofs of the two equivalences will follow after the diagram.

Proposition 3.5. Equivalent are:
1. CUT(ﬁn).
2. CC(ﬁn).
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let (Xn) be a sequence of non–empty ﬁnite sets. By (1),
there exists a surjection f : N →
n∈N
Xn. For each n, deﬁne
xn = f(min{m ∈N | f(m) ∈Xn}).
Then (xn) ∈
n∈N
Xn.
(2) ⇒(1) Let (Xn) be a sequence of ﬁnite sets with 
n∈N
Xn = X. Then
the sequence (Yn), deﬁned by Yn = Xn \ 
m<n
Xm is a sequence of pairwise
disjoint ﬁnite sets with 
n∈N
Yn = X. For each n, the set Ln of linear order
relations on Yn is a non–empty, ﬁnite set. By (2), there exists an element (ϕn)
in 
n∈N
Ln. Order X as follows
x ≤y ⇔



x ∈Yn and y ∈Ym and n < m
or
{x, y} ⊆Yn and xϕny.
If X is inﬁnite, then (X, ≤) is order–isomorphic to the set of natural numbers
with its canonical order. Thus X is at most countable.
Proposition 3.6. Equivalent are:
1. CUT(2).
2. CC(2).
Proof. Analogous to the proof of Proposition 3.5. An alternative proof of the
implication (2) ⇒(1) is the following:
Let (Xn) be a sequence of 2–element sets with union X: By (2), there
exists an element (xn) in 
n∈N
Xn. For each n, let yn be the unique element
of Xn \ {xn}. Then the function f : N →X, deﬁned by f(2n) = xn and
f(2n + 1) = yn, is surjective. Thus X is at most countable.
The use of the Axiom of Choice may also be overlooked in proofs that are
so trivial that one does not bother to analyze any details. Here is an example:
Statement 3.7.
1. Finite topological spaces are compact.
2. Countable topological spaces are Lindel¨of.

3.1 Hidden Choice
25
Proof. Obvious.
Discussion: Although the proofs of the statements (1) and (2) are
straightforward indeed, and very similar too, there is a marked diﬀerence.
The proof of (1) holds in ZF, the proof of (2), however, makes use of the
Axiom of Choice. So (1) is a result in ZF, but (2) fails to be so. In fact, the
following holds:
Theorem 3.8. 9 Equivalent are:
1. Countable topological spaces are Lindel¨of.
2. N is Lindel¨of.
3. Q is Lindel¨of.
4. Every unbounded subset of R contains an unbounded sequence.
5. CC(R).
Proof. (1) ⇒(3) since Q is countable.
(3) ⇒(4). Let A be a subset of R, unbounded to the right. Let, for each
a ∈A, C(a) = {x ∈Q | x < a}. Then C = {C(a) | a ∈A} is an open cover
of Q. Let C′ = {Cn | n ∈N} be a countable subset of C that covers Q. For
each Cn there exists a unique element an in A with Cn = C(an) — since
supR C(a) = a. Thus (an) is an unbounded sequence in A.
(4) ⇒(5) Let (Xn) be a sequence of non–empty subsets Xn of R. Let
f : R →(0, 1) be a ﬁxed bijection, and, for each n ∈N, let σn : R →R be
deﬁned by σn(x) = n + x.
Deﬁne Yn = σ[f[Xn]]. Then Yn ⊆(n, n + 1), and Y = 
n∈N
Yn is an un-
bounded subset of R.
By (4), there exists an unbounded sequence yn in Y . Thus
M = {m ∈N | ∃n ∈N yn ∈Ym} is an inﬁnite subset of N with

m∈M
Ym ̸= ∅.
Let (˜ym)m∈M be an element of this product. Deﬁne xm to be the unique
element of Xm with σm(f(xm)) = ˜ym. Then (xm) ∈

m∈M
Xm. Thus (5) follows
via Exercises to Section 2.2, E 5(1).
(5) ⇒(2) Let U be an open cover of N. Then for each n ∈N the set
Xn = {U ∈U | n ∈U} is a non–empty subset of PN, the powerset of N. Since
PN and R have the same cardinality, (5) implies that there exists an element
(Un) in 
n∈N
Xn. Thus {Un | n ∈N} is a countable subcover of U.
(2) ⇒(1) Every countable topological space is a continuous image of N.
Since continuous images of Lindel¨of spaces are Lindel¨of, (1) follows from (2).
In analogy to Statement 3.7 we obtain:
Statement 3.9.
1. Finite sums of compact topological spaces are compact.
2. Countable sums of Lindel¨of spaces are Lindel¨of.

Proof. Obvious.
Discussion: Here, as for Statement 3.7, (1) and (2) have trivial and par-
allel proofs, but while (1) is a result in ZF, (2) is not. In fact, as will be shown
in Theorem 4.62, (2) is equivalent to CC. Not even ﬁnite sums of Lindel¨of
spaces need to be Lindel¨of. Even worse, the sum of a compact space and a
Lindel¨of space may fail to be Lindel¨of, as shown in Remark 4.63.
Exercises to Section 3.1:
E 1. Show that for each natural number n the following conditions are equiv-
alent:
(1) CC(≤n), i.e., 
i∈N
Xi ̸= ∅for each sequence (Xi)i∈N of sets with
1 ≤|Xi| ≤n.
(2) For each sequence (Xi)i∈N of n–element sets there exists a sequence
(≤i)i∈N of linear orders ≤i on Xi.
(3) CUT(n), i.e., countable unions of n–element sets are at most count-
able.
(4) CUT(≤n), i.e., the union of each sequence (Xi)i∈N of sets with
1 ≤|Xi| ≤n is at most countable.
(5) CC(i) holds for each i ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}.
E 2. Show the equivalence of the following conditions:
(1) PCC(2), i.e., for each sequence (Xn) of 2–element sets Xn there exists
an inﬁnite subset M of N with

m∈M
Xm ̸= ∅.
(2) The countable union of pairwise disjoint 2–element sets is Dedekind–
inﬁnite.
E 3. Show that, for each at most countable set X, the set 

Xn is at most
countable.

(1) The set Q of rational numbers.
(2) The set 

Nn.
(3) The set of all algebraic real numbers.
(4) The set of all algebraic complex numbers.
E 5. 10 Show that the following condition (1) implies all subsequent ones:
(1) R is the countable union of countable sets.

ordinals with ω1 = sup

E 6. 12 Show that CC(R) implies that the Lebesgue–measure is σ-additive.
[Hint: See the proof of Proposition 7.14. Cf. also Exercise to Section 5.1,
E 13.]
3.2 Unnecessary Choice
In Section 3.1 it has been shown that several ZFC–theorems may erroneously
be considered to hold in ZF; due to the fact that the use of AC was hidden.
Here we will show that several ZFC–theorems may erroneously be considered
to fail in ZF; due to the fact that their familiar proofs use AC, although this
use of AC may be only apparent or can be avoided by alternative proofs which
sometimes are drastically diﬀerent from the familiar ones but more often just
require a minor adjustment of the latter.
Proposition 3.10. Finite sums of compact spaces are compact.
Proof in ZFC: Let X be the sum of the pairwise disjoint compact spaces
X1, . . . , Xn, and let B be an open cover of X. For each i = 1, . . . , n the set
Bi = {B ∩Xi | B ∈B} is an open cover of Xi. By compactness each Bi
contains a ﬁnite cover Fi of Xi. For each F in Fi choose an element B(F) in
B with F = B(F) ∩Xi.
Then the set F = {B(F) | i ∈I and F ∈Fi} is a ﬁnite cover of X with
F ⊆B. Thus X is compact.
Observation:
In the above proof, choice has been used to select the
B(F)’s. However, this use of choice is only apparent, since I and each Fi are
ﬁnite, and the axiom of choice for ﬁnite indexing sets holds in ZF. Thus the
above is a valid proof in ZF. Observe however that the analogous proof of the
statement
Finite sums of Lindel¨of spaces are Lindel¨of
fails in ZF, since here countable choice is used. Indeed, the statement about
Lindel¨of spaces may fail in ZF. See Remark 4.63.
Theorem 3.11. Every bounded, inﬁnite subset X of R has an accumulation
point13 in R.
11
[Chu27]
12
[KeTa2003]
13
x is called an accumulation point of X iﬀevery neighborhood of x meets X in
an inﬁnite set.

28
3 Elementary Observations
Proof
in ZFC: Since X is bounded, there exist real numbers a and b with
X ⊆[a, b]. Observe ﬁrst that [a, b] is compact. Proceed indirectly by assuming
that there exists an open cover B of [a, b] without ﬁnite subcover, deﬁne x =
sup{y ∈[a, b] | some ﬁnite subset of B covers [a, y]}, observe that x ∈B
for some B ∈B, and arrive at a contradiction. Next, assume that X has
no accumulation point in R. Then for each x ∈[a, b], there exists an open
neighborhood B(x) such that X ∩B(x) is ﬁnite. Then B = {B(x)∩[a, b] | x ∈
[a, b]} is an open cover of [a, b], and thus has a ﬁnite subcover F. Consequently
X = 
F ∈F
(X∩F) is a ﬁnite union of ﬁnite sets and thus ﬁnite, a contradiction.
Observation: In the above proof, choice has been used to select the
B(x)’s. This use of choice can be avoided by deﬁning B alternatively as the
set of all open subsets of [a, b] that meet only ﬁnitely many elements of X.
This way a proof in ZF results.
The method, employed above, to modify a ZFC–proof into a ZF–proof,
can be applied quite often. Here is another example:
Proposition 3.12. Closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact.
Proof in ZFC: Let X be a closed subspace of a compact space Y , and let B
be an open cover of X. For each B ∈B select an open set A(B) in Y with
B = X ∩A(B). Deﬁne A = {A(B) | B ∈B}. Then A∪{Y \X} being an open
cover of Y , contains a ﬁnite cover F. Consequently G = {X ∩F | F ∈(F ∩A)}
is a ﬁnite cover of X with G ⊆B, Thus X is compact.
Observation: In the above proof, choice has been used to select the
A(B)’s. This use of choice can be avoided by deﬁning A alternatively by
A = {A | A open in Y and (X ∩A) ∈B}.
Theorem 3.13. 14 [0, 1]N is compact.
Proof in ZFC: It suﬃces (cf. the remark following Deﬁnition 3.21) to show
that in X = [0, 1]N every ﬁlter F has a cluster point (xn). Denote the n–th
projection by πn : [0, 1]N →[0, 1], and the neighborhood–ﬁlter of a point x in
[0, 1] by U(x). Deﬁne, by recursion, points xn in [0, 1] and ﬁlters Fn on X as
follows:
x0 is a cluster point of the ﬁlter {G ⊆[0, 1] | π−1
0 [G] ∈F}.
F0 is the ﬁlter on X, generated by the set
F ∪{π−1
0 [U] | U ∈U(x0)}.
xn+1 is a cluster point of the ﬁlter {G ⊆[0, 1] | π−1
n+1[G] ∈Fn}.
Fn+1 is the ﬁlter on X, generated by the set
Fn ∪{π−1
n+1[U] | U ∈U(xn+1)}.
14
[Loe65], [DHHKR2003a].

3.2 Unnecessary Choice
29
Then x = (xn) is a cluster point of 
n∈N
Fn and thus of F in X.
Observation: In the above proof, choice has been used (in fact: dependent
choice) to select the xn’s. This use of choice can be avoided via the observation
that for every ﬁlter G on [0, 1] the set of cluster points of G, being a non–empty,
closed subset of [0, 1], contains a smallest member. By choosing the xn’s as
the smallest cluster points of the corresponding ﬁlters we obtain a proof in
ZF.
Another such example, using distinguished choices instead of arbitrary
ones, is the following:
Proposition 3.14. Every continuous function f : [0, 1] →R is uniformly con-
tinuous.
Proof in ZFC: Let ϵ be a positive real number. For every x ∈[0, 1], select a
positive δx such that y ∈[[0, 1]∩(x−δx, x+δx)] implies |f(y)−f(x)| ≤ϵ
2. Then
the sets Ux = [0, 1]∩(x−δx, x+δx) form, for x ∈[0, 1], an open cover of [0, 1].
By compactness, there exists a ﬁnite subset F of [0, 1] such that {Ux | x ∈F}
covers [0, 1]. Consider δ = min{ δx
2 | x ∈F}. Then, for any points x and y in
[0, 1] with |x−y| < δ, there exists some z ∈F with {x, y} ⊆Uz, which implies
|f(x) −f(y)| ≤|f(x) −f(z)| + |f(z) −f(y)| < ϵ.
Observation: In the above proof, choice has been used to select the δx’s.
However, as in the previous result, choice can be avoided, e.g., by deﬁning
δx =
1
nx , where nx = min{n ∈N+ | y ∈[[0, 1]∩(x−1
n, x+ 1
n)] ⇒|f(y)−f(x)| <
ϵ
2}.
Next, an example of a ZFC–proof which requires drastic remodeling.
Theorem 3.15. 15 Every sequentially continuous16 function f : R →R is
continuous.
Proof in ZFC: Assume that f is sequentially continuous but not continuous
at some x ∈R. Then there exists a positive real number ϵ such that for
each positive real number δ there exists some y ∈R with |x −y| ≤δ and
|f(x) −f(y)| > ϵ. Choose, for every n ∈N+, an xn in R with
|x −xn| ≤1
n and |f(x) −f(xn)| > ϵ.
Then the sequence (xn) converges to x, but the sequence (f(xn)) does not
converge to f(x), contradicting the sequential continuity of f at x.
15
[Sie18]
16
f is called sequentially continuous iﬀ(xn) →x implies (f(xn)) →f(x).

30
3 Elementary Observations
Observation: In the above proof, choice has been used to select the xn’s.
This use of choice is essential. In fact, the statement
Every function f : R →R, that is sequentially continuous at some
point x, must be continuous at x
does not hold in ZF (see Theorem 4.54). However, Theorem 3.15 holds in ZF:
Proof in ZF: Let f : R →R be sequentially continuous. Using the fact that
Q is countable and is dense in R we obtain, as above, that for each x ∈R the
restriction of f to the set Q ∪{x} is continuous at x. Thus for ϵ > 0 there
exists δ > 0 such that
(y ∈Q and |x −y| ≤δ) implies |f(x) −f(y)| ≤ϵ.
Since for each z ∈R with |x −z| ≤δ, the restriction of f to Q ∪{z} is
continuous, the above implies that |f(x) −f(z)| ≤ϵ. Thus f is continuous at
x.
Finally, two examples of ZFC–proofs that remain valid only under special
assumptions. If these are not satisﬁed, another proof has to be constructed.
In other words: these results require two distinct proofs, each covering just
some part of the ZF–world:
Theorem 3.16. 17 For subspaces X of R, the following conditions are equiv-
alent:
1. X is compact.
2. X is sequentially compact and Lindel¨of.
Proof in ZFC: Obviously (1) implies (2). For the converse, assume that there
exists an open cover B of X without a ﬁnite subcover. Since X is Lindel¨of,
we may assume that B is countable, say B = {Bn | n ∈N}. We may further
assume that, for each n ∈N, Bn ⊆Bn+1 and Bn+1 \ Bn ̸= ∅. Choose ele-
ments xn in Bn+1 \ Bn. Then (xn) is a sequence in X without a convergent
subsequence, contradicting sequential compactness of X. Thus X is compact.
Observation: In the above proof, choice has been used to select the xn’s.
Since the sets Bn+1 \ Bn are subsets of R, the proof remains valid provided
CC(R) is satisﬁed. What happens if CC(R) fails? Here a completely diﬀerent
proof is needed. This will be supplied by Theorem 7.2, where it is shown that
the failure of CC(R) implies that every Lindel¨of–subspace of R is already
compact.

3.2 Unnecessary Choice

Proof
in ZFC: Let (Xn)n∈N be a sequence of topological spaces Xn, each
having precisely two points xn and yn. Let 2 be the discrete space with un-
derlying set {0, 1}. Then for each n ∈N, the map fn : 2 →Xn, deﬁned by
fn(0) = xn and fn(1) = yn is a continuous surjection. Hence 
n∈N
Xn is a
continuous image of 2N. Since the latter, being a closed subspace of [0, 1]N, is
compact by Proposition 3.12 and Theorem 3.13, so is the former.
Observation: In the above proof choice has been used to deﬁne the fn’s,
since we have no rule that determines which of the 2 points of Xn is to be called
xn, and which yn. However, the following simple case–distinction provides a
ZF–proof (each of the 2 cases may indeed occur):
Case 1: 
n∈N
Xn = ∅. In this case 
n∈N
Xn is trivially compact.
Case 2: 
n∈N
Xn ̸= ∅. In this case, let (xn) be an element of 
n∈N
Xn. Then
proceed as in the ZFC–proof, described above.
Observe, however, that in ZF countable products of 3–element spaces may
fail to be compact. See Section 4.8 for more details.

3.3 Concepts Split Up: Compactness
It is a hopeless endeavour, doomed to failure to attempt to prove
either the Stone– ˇCech compactiﬁcation theorem or the Tychonoﬀ
product theorem without invoking some form of the axiom of
choice, . . . It is my feeling, however, that the deﬁnition of com-
pactness relative to which the theorems of Stone– ˇCech and Ty-
chonoﬀare unprovable without the axiom of choice is, from the
point of view of topological analysis and the theory of rings of
continuous functions, unnatural and unsuitable.

However, this is ‘mere matter of detail’ as the Irishman said when
he was asked how he had killed his landlord.
Thomas Henry Huxley22
Another problem, encountered when working in ZF instead of ZFC, arises
from the fact that various familiar descriptions of a certain concept, equivalent
to each other in the presence of AC, may separate in its absence into diﬀerent
concepts and that the validity in ZF of familiar results concerning this concept
may depend crucially on the chosen variant of the concept.
Paradigmatically we will illustrate this situation by analyzing the com-
pactness concept. In this section we will present several familiar descriptions
of compactness and investigate the set–theoretical conditions responsible for
any pair of these descriptions to characterize the same concept. How certain
theorems, in particular the TychonoﬀTheorem and the ˇCech–Stone Theorem,
the Ascoli Theorem, and the Baire Category Theorem, depend on the chosen
form will be analyzed in later sections.
Let us start by presenting the deﬁnition of compactness (originally termed
bicompactness) as given by Alexandroﬀand Urysohn in their fundamental
paper23 (in the original French). They start with the deﬁnition of complete
accumulation points:
D´eﬁnition 3.18. Un point est dit point d’accumulation compl`ete de l’ensemble
A, si quel-que soi le voisinage V (ζ) la puissance de A ∩V (ζ) est ´egale `a celle
de A tout entier.
Next they prove in the following theorem the equivalence of 3 conditions:
Th´eor`eme 3.19. I Les trois propri´et´es suivantes d’un espace topologique R,
sont ´equivalents:

(A) Tout ensemble inﬁni situ´e dans R poss`ede au moins un point d’accumul-
ation compl`ete.
(B) Toute suite inﬁnie bien ordonn´ee d’ensembles ferm´es d´ecroissants poss´ede
au moins un point appartenant `a tous les ensembles de la suite.
(C) De toute inﬁnit´e de domaines recouvrant l’espace R, on peut extraire un
nombre ﬁni de domaines jouissant de la mˆeme propri´et´e.
Finally, after proving the above theorem, they call a space (bi)compact
provided it satisﬁes one and hence all three of the above conditions:
Le th´eor`eme I justiﬁe, il nous semble la d´eﬁnition fondamentale suivante:
D´eﬁnition 3.20. Un espace R s’appelle BICOMPACT s’il v´eriﬁe l’un quel-
conque et par suite toutes les trois conditions (A), (B), (C).
This procedure of deﬁning mathematical concepts is not uncommon. Un-
fortunately in the present case Theorem 3.19 fails badly in ZF. No two of the
3 properties (A), (B) and (C) remain equivalent. Moreover, as we will see in
a moment, the equivalence of conditions (A) and (C) holds true if and only if
AC is valid. Furthermore, in the absence of AC condition (B) is somewhat
unnatural and impracticable.
So, what should we understand by compactness, when working in ZF? His-
torically, condition (A) has been used by early investigators, e.g., Tychonoﬀ
and ˇCech. Most modern books, however, use condition (C). In addition other
useful descriptions, in particular by means of ﬁlters and ultraﬁlters, have
emerged over the years. Next we are going to investigate the relations be-
tween the most familiar compactness concepts; ﬁrst in the realm of topolog-
ical spaces, next in that of completely regular spaces, then for pseudometric
spaces, and ﬁnally for subspaces of R. Interesting facts will emerge on each of
these levels.
Deﬁnition 3.21. 24 A topological space X is called:
1. Compact provided that in X every open cover contains a ﬁnite one.
2. Filter–compact provided that in X each ﬁlter has a cluster point.
3. Ultraﬁlter–compact provided that in X each ultraﬁlter converges.
4. Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact provided that in X each inﬁnite subset has
a complete accumulation point.
The only implications between the 4 compactness concepts, deﬁned above,
are the trivial ones:
compact ⇐⇒ﬁlter–compact =⇒ultraﬁlter–compact.
A compact space need not be Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact (see the proof of
Theorem 3.22). Even the closed unit interval [0, 1], which is clearly compact,

For further compactness versions see [Com68], [BeHe98], and [DHHRS2002].

may fail to be Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact (see Theorem 3.32). Conversely,
in certain models of ZF there exist Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact spaces that
fail to be ultraﬁlter–compact.25
Theorem 3.22. 26
1. Equivalent are:
a) Compact = Ultraﬁlter–compact.
b) UFT, the Ultraﬁlter Theorem.
2. Equivalent are:
a) Compact = Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact.
b) Ultraﬁlter–compact = Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact.
c) AC.
Proof. (1) (a) ⇒(b). By Theorem 4.37, it suﬃces to show that products of
compact Hausdorﬀspaces are compact. Since products of ultraﬁlter–compact
Hausdorﬀspaces are ultraﬁlter–compact, this follows from (a).
(b) ⇒(a) It suﬃces to show that each ﬁlter F in an ultraﬁlter–compact
space X has a cluster point. By (b), F can be enlarged to an ultraﬁlter U.
Since every convergence point of U is a cluster point of F, the result follows.
(2) As is well–known, (c) implies (a) and (b). To show that each of (a)
resp. (b) imply (c), consider two inﬁnite cardinals a and b. Then there exist
disjoint sets A and B with |A| = a and |B| = b. The topological space X
whose underlying set is A ∪B and whose open sets are ∅, A, B, and A ∪B, is
simultaneously compact and ultraﬁlter–compact. So each of (a) and (b) imply
that X is Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact. Consequently the set A ∪B has a
complete accumulation point x. If x ∈A, then a = |A| = |A∪B| ≥b. If x ∈B,
then b = |B| = |A ∪B| ≥a. Thus a ≤b or b ≤a. Consequently Theorem
4.20, together with the observation that every ﬁnite cardinal is comparable
with any other one, implies that AC holds.
More important than compact spaces are compact Hausdorﬀspaces. This
is mainly due to two facts. First, compact Hausdorﬀspaces are regular and
satisfy a property that is analoguous to completeness among metric spaces:
they are H–closed, i.e., closed in every Hausdorﬀspace in which they can be
embedded; in other words: they cannot be densely embedded into any properly
larger Hausdorﬀspace. In fact, as Alexandroﬀand Urysohn have shown, these
properties characterize compact Hausdorﬀspaces: they are precisely the H–
closed regular spaces. This characterization remains valid in ZF (see Exercise
E 2).
Secondly, and even more important, is the fact that compact Hausdorﬀ
spaces are normal and hence completely regular, — thus, modulo homeo-
morphism, precisely the closed subspaces of powers [0, 1]I of the closed unit

3.3 Concepts Split Up: Compactness
35
interval. Unfortunately, in ZF this characterization breaks down for two rea-
sons: On one hand, though compact Hausdorﬀspaces are still normal, they
may no longer be completely regular27. On the other hand, though spaces of
the form [0, 1], [0, 1]n, and [0, 1]N are compact28; for arbitrary indexing sets I,
the spaces [0, 1]I need no longer be so.
Deﬁnition 3.23. A topological space is called Tychonoﬀ–compact provided it
is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of some power [0, 1]I of the closed unit
interval.
Proposition 3.24. 29 Equivalent are:
1. Tychonoﬀ–compact = compact and completely regular.
2. UFT.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Theorem 4.70, and the fact that all spaces of the form [0, 1]I
are compact implies (2).
(2) ⇒(1) Every completely regular space X can be embedded into
[0, 1]C(X,[0,1]). If X is compact, H–closedness of X implies that the embedding
is closed. Thus X is Tychonoﬀ–compact. Conversely, let X be Tychonoﬀ–
compact. Then X is completely regular. By (2) and Theorem 4.70, together
with the fact that closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact, X must
be compact.
Next we proceed to the realm of pseudometric30 spaces. Here, as opposed
to the situation with metric spaces, where the relations between the various
compactness concepts are not yet completely understood, we will be able to
satisfactorily analyze the relations between various familiar descriptions of
compactness.
Deﬁnition 3.25. A pseudometric space X is called:
1. Weierstrass–compact provided in X every inﬁnite set has an accumulation
point31.
2. Countably compact provided in X every countable open cover contains a
ﬁnite one.
3. Sequentially compact provided in X every sequence has a convergent sub-
sequence.
4. Complete provided in X every Cauchy sequence converges.

5. Totally bounded provided that for each positive real number r there exists
a ﬁnite subset F of X such that for each x ∈X there exists some y ∈F
with d(x, y) < r.
Proposition 3.26. 32 Under CC the following conditions are equivalent for
pseudometric spaces X:
1. X is compact.
2. X is Weierstrass–compact.
3. X is countably compact.
4. X is sequentially compact.
5. X is totally bounded and complete.

So it remains to be shown that (4) implies (1). This will be done in 2
steps:
(4) ⇒(5) If X is sequentially compact, then X is complete. Assume that
X fails to be totally bounded. Then there exists a positive real number r such
that for each n ∈N+ the set
Xn = {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈Xn | i ̸= j ⇒d(xi, xj) ≥r}
is non–empty. Under CC there exists an element (an) in 
n
Xn. Consider
a1, a2, a3, . . . by concatenation as a sequence in X. This sequence contains
arbitrary long strings xn, xn+1, . . . , xn+k such that any two of its members
have a distance d(xn+i, xn+j) ≥r. This fact immediately implies that (xn)
has a subsequence (xν(n)) in which the distance of any two members is at least

2r. Thus (xν(n)) has no convergent subsequence, contradicting the sequential
compactness of X.
(5) ⇒(1) Let X be totally bounded and complete. Assume that U is an
open cover of X without a ﬁnite subcover of X. For x ∈X and r ∈R+, deﬁne
S(x, r) = {y ∈X | d(x, y) < r}. By total boundedness of X, for each n ∈N+,
the set An of all tuples (x1, . . . , xm) in X with X = m
i=1 S(xi, 1
n) is non–
empty. By CC, there exists an element (an) in 
n
An. Denote each an by
(xn
1, xn
2, . . . xn
m(n)), and deﬁne, via recursion, a sequence (yn) in X as follows:
y1 = x1
k where k = min{i | no ﬁnite subset of U covers S(x1

yn+1 = xn+1

Then (yn) is a Cauchy sequence in X. By completeness, (yn) converges to
some point y in X. Thus there exists some n ∈N+ and some U ∈U with
S(y, 1
n) ⊆U, providing a contradiction. Thus X is compact.
For the above result to hold, CC is not only suﬃcient but also necessary.
More precisely:
Theorem 3.27. 33 In the realm of pseudometric spaces the following condi-
tions are equivalent:
1. CC.
2. Compact = sequentially compact.
3. Compact = totally bounded and complete.
4. Weierstrass–compact = totally bounded and complete.
5. Countably compact = totally bounded and complete.
6. Sequentially compact = totally bounded and complete.
7. Sequentially compact = countably compact.
Proof. By Proposition 3.26, (1) implies all the above conditions. To show that
each of these implies (1), assume that (1) fails. Then, by Theorem 2.12(3),
also PCC fails, i.e., there exists a sequence (Xn) of non–empty sets such that
each sequence in 
n
Xn meets only ﬁnitely many Xn’s.
Construct a pseudometric space with underlying set X = 
n
(Xn × {n})
and distance function d, deﬁned by
d((x, n), (y, m)) =
0, if n = m
1, otherwise.
Then (X, d) is sequentially compact, but neither totally bounded nor count-
ably compact. Thus (2), (6), and (7) fail. Next, construct a pseudometric space
with underlying set X as above and distance function a, deﬁned by

Then (X, a) is complete and totally bounded, but fails to be countably com-
pact. Thus (3) and (5) fail.
It remains to be shown that (4) implies (1). Assume that (1) fails, choose
a sequence (Xn) as above, and construct a space (X, d) as above. Since (X, d)
fails to be totally bounded, condition (4) implies that it fails to be Weierstrass–
compact. So there exists an inﬁnite subset A of X without an accumulation
point in X. Deﬁne An = A ∩(Xn × {n}) and M = {n ∈N | An ̸= ∅}. Then
(Am)m∈M is a countable family of non–empty ﬁnite sets.
Assume that no sequence in Z =

m∈M
Am meets inﬁnitely many Am’s.
Then the pseudometric space (Z, b), deﬁned by
b((x, n), (y, m)) =

is complete and totally bounded, but not Weierstrass–compact, thus violating
condition (4). Therefore there exists a sequence in Z which meets inﬁnitely
many Am’s and thus inﬁnitely many Xm’s, contradicting the choice of the
Xn’s. Thus (1) holds.
Observe that the ﬁrst part of the proof of (4) ⇒(1) above also shows that
the implication
Weierstrass–compact ⇒countably compact
implies PCMC and thus CMC. This implication is an equivalence, as
the following result, presented here without proof, states:
Theorem 3.28. 34 In the realm of pseudometric spaces the following condi-
tions are equivalent:
1. CMC.
2. Weierstrass–compact ⇒countably compact.
3. Weierstrass–compact = compact.

Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Every Weierstrass–compact space is sequentially compact.
For the converse, consider an inﬁnite subset A of a sequentially compact space
X. By (1), there exists an injective sequence (an) in A. By sequential com-
pactness of X, some subsequence of (an) converges to some x ∈X. Then x is
an accumulation point of A. Thus X is Weierstrass–compact.
(2) ⇒(1) If (1) fails, there exists an inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite set X. Then the
pseudometric space (X, d) deﬁned by d(x, y) =
0, if x = y
1, if x ̸= y is sequentially
compact, but not Weierstrass–compact. Thus (2) fails.
Finally let us sketch the situation for subspaces of R. More details will be
presented in Section 4.6.
Proposition 3.30. 36 For subspaces X of R, the following conditions are
equivalent:
1. X is compact.
2. X is countably compact.
3. X is closed and bounded in R.
4. X is sequentially compact and Lindel¨of.
Proof. The proof that (1), (2), and (3) are equivalent can be carried out as in
ZFC. To show that (4) implies (1) consider two cases (cf. Theorem 3.16):
Case 1: CC(R) holds.
In this case, every sequentially compact space is easily seen to be closed and
bounded in R, thus compact.
Case 2: CC(R) fails.
In this case, every Lindel¨of subspace of R is already compact (see Section 7.1).
Proposition 3.31. 37 In the realm of subspaces of R, the following conditions
are equivalent:
1. Sequentially compact = compact.
2. Sequentially compact ⇒closed.
3. Sequentially compact ⇒bounded.
4. Complete ⇒closed.
5. R is a sequential space.
Proof. See Theorem 4.55 and Exercises to Section 4.6, E 4.
Theorem 3.32.
1. If there is no free ultraﬁlter on R, then every subspace

a) R has compact subspaces that fail to be Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact,
e.g., the closed unit interval [0, 1].
b) R has subspaces that are Weierstrass–compact and complete, but fail
to be Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact or compact, e.g., X itself.
Proof. (1) Immediate.
(2) Since N is discrete every subset of N is a zeroset. Thus in N every
zero–ultraﬁlter is ﬁxed and thus converges. By Exercise E 4 this implies that
N is Tychonoﬀ–compact.
(3) Let R have an inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite subset X. Then every proper subset
of X has a smaller cardinality than X. Consequently X has no complete
accumulation point in R. Hence neither X nor any subspace Y of R with
X ⊆Y can be Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact. Let f : R →(0, 1) be some
homeomorphism. Then f[X] is an inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite subset of [0, 1]. Thus [0, 1]
is not Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact.
Being D–ﬁnite, X contains no injective sequence. Thus X is complete.
X is not closed, since otherwise one could construct an injective sequence
in X. Thus X is not compact. However, X is Weierstrass–compact, for the
assumption that there exists an inﬁnite subset Y of X without accumulation
point in X, leads to a contradiction as follows: for each x ∈X (except for the
largest element of X, if X has one) there exists a largest half–open interval
I(x) = [x, rx) in R with [x, rx)∩Y = ∅. Since these intervals I(x) are pairwise
disjoint and Q is dense in R and countable, it follows that the set of these
intervals and thus X itself must be countable; a contradiction.

is categorical, thus not problematic. If, however, the concept of being ﬁnite

“Elementary concepts such as ﬁniteness and well–order depend on the chosen
system (Σ1 or Σ2) and it is conceivable that this dependence is essential: a set
A may appear to be well–ordered (resp. ﬁnite) in system Σ1, but turn out not to
be well–ordered (resp. inﬁnite) in the “ﬁner” system Σ2.” [vNeu25]. Note that
von Neumann’s skepticism, expressed above, uses — independently of Tarski —
the ﬁniteness–deﬁnition that we present in 4.3.

is considered to be more fundamental than that of number, as strongly advo-
cated, e.g., by Frege and Dedekind (and natural numbers are deﬁned as the
cardinals of ﬁnite sets), problems arise. First of all the concept of being ﬁnite
loses its absoluteness. Secondly, how should ﬁniteness be deﬁned? There are
several diﬀerent descriptions, all equivalent to each other in ZFC, but not so
in ZF. Historically the oldest deﬁnition is due to Dedekind (1888)4.
It leads to disaster!
Deﬁnition 4.1. 5 A set X is called Dedekind–inﬁnite or just D–inﬁnite pro-
vided that there exists a proper subset Y of X with |X| = |Y |; otherwise X is
called Dedekind–ﬁnite or just D–ﬁnite.
Proposition 4.2. Equivalent are:
1. X is D–inﬁnite.
2. |X| = |X| + 1.
3. 6 ℵ0 ≤|X|.
Proof. (3) ⇒(2) Let f : N →X be an injection, and let ∞be an element,
not contained in X. Then the map g: X →X ∪{∞}, deﬁned by
g(x) =



∞,
if x = f(0)
f(n), if x = f(n + 1)
x,
otherwise
,
is a bijection.
(2) ⇒(1) Let ∞be an element, not contained in X, and let
f : X →X ∪{∞} be a bijection. Then f −1, restricted to X, is an injection
from X onto the proper subset X\{f −1(∞)} of X.
(1) ⇒(3) Let f : X →X be an injection onto a proper subset of X.
Choose an element y in X\f[X] and deﬁne recursively a map g: N →X by
g(0) = y and g(n + 1) = f(g(n)). Then g is an injection.
Disaster 4.3. The following can happen:
1. 7 D–ﬁnite unions of D–ﬁnite sets may be D–inﬁnite.
2. The power set of a D–ﬁnite set may be D–inﬁnite.
3. A D–inﬁnite set may be the image of a D–ﬁnite set.8
4
[Ded1888]
5
Cf. Deﬁnition 2.13.
6
I.e., there exists an injection N →X. Here the natural numbers are supposed
to have their familiar properties, being either deﬁned axiomatically or as the
cardinal numbers of ﬁnite sets (as deﬁned in 4.4). The cardinal numbers of D–
ﬁnite sets may contain “inﬁnitely large” members and fail badly to satisfy the
principle of induction, a real disaster!
7
Contrast this with Exercise E 14a.
8
Even worse: any ℵα (no matter how large) maybe the image of some D–ﬁnite
set. See [Mon75].

4.1 Finiteness
45
Proof. Consider a model of ZF with the following property:
(F) There exists a sequence (Xn) of pairwise disjoint 2–element sets
Xn = {xn, yn} such that X =  Xn is D–ﬁnite
(Such models exist9— another disaster). Then
(1) For each x ∈X consider the set Yx = {x, n}, where n is the unique
natural number with x ∈Xn. Then Y = 
x∈X
Yx is a D–ﬁnite union of D–ﬁnite
sets, but Y = N ∪
n Xn is D–inﬁnite, since the map f : N →Y , deﬁned by
f(n) = n is obviously injective.
(2) Though X is D–ﬁnite, the power set PX is D–inﬁnite, since the map
f : N →PX, deﬁned by f(n) = 
m≤n
Xm is injective.
(3) Though X is D–ﬁnite, the map f : X →N, deﬁned by
f(x) is the unique n ∈N with x ∈Xn
is surjective.
The foregoing disasters show that — in the absence of AC — the above
deﬁnition of D–ﬁniteness is badly ﬂawed. As satisfactory concept can however
be obtained — as shown by Tarski (1924) — in the following way:
Deﬁnition 4.4. 10 A set X is called ﬁnite, provided that each non–empty
subset of PX contains a minimal element with respect to the inclusion order.
Sets that are not ﬁnite are called inﬁnite.
Here follow some sample results:
Proposition 4.5. 11 Equivalent are:
1. X is ﬁnite.
2. If A ⊆PX satisﬁes
a) ∅∈A, and
b) A ∈A and x ∈X imply (A ∪{x}) ∈A,
then X ∈A.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) The collection B = {X\A | A ∈A} has a minimal element
B. Consequently A has a maximal element A = X\B. Thus (b) implies that
A = X.
(2) ⇒(1) Let A be the set of all ﬁnite subsets of X. Since A satisﬁes (a)
and (b), (2) implies that X ∈A. Thus X is ﬁnite.
9
See, e.g., Model A5 (N2(2) in [HoRu98]).
10
[Tar24a]. Cf. also [vNeu25].
11
[Tar24a]. Observe that by Proposition 4.5, the deﬁnition of ﬁniteness as given
in 4.4 is equivalent to the traditional deﬁnition that X is ﬁnite iﬀ|X| = n for
some n ∈N.

Proposition 4.6. 12 If X and Y are ﬁnite, so is X ∪Y .
Proof. Let A be a non–empty subset of P(X ∪Y ). Then B = {A∩X | A ∈A}
contains a minimal element B, since X is ﬁnite; and C = {A ∩Y | A ∈A and
A ∩X = B} contains a minimal element C, since Y is ﬁnite. Thus B ∪C is a
minimal element of A.
Proposition 4.7. 13 Finite unions of ﬁnite sets are ﬁnite.
Proof. Let M be a ﬁnite set of ﬁnite sets. Consider
A = {B ⊆M |

B is ﬁnite}.
Then, in view of 4.6, A satisﬁes the conditions (a) and (b) of 4.5(2). Thus
M ∈A, i.e.,  M is ﬁnite.
Proposition 4.8. 14 If X is ﬁnite, then so is PX.
Proof. Consider A = {A ⊆X | PA is ﬁnite }. Then, in view of 4.6, A satisﬁes
the conditions (a) and (b) of 4.5(2). Thus X ∈A, i.e., PX is ﬁnite.
Proposition 4.9. 15 Images of ﬁnite sets are ﬁnite.
Proof. Let X be ﬁnite, and let f : X →Y be a surjection. If A is a non–empty
subset of PY , then B = {f −1[A] | A ∈A} is a non–empty subset of PX, and
thus contains a minimal element B. Then f[B] is a minimal element of A.
Let us return to Dedekind’s deﬁnition of D–ﬁniteness. How are the con-
cepts of ﬁniteness and D–ﬁniteness related to each other?
Proposition 4.10. Every ﬁnite set is D–ﬁnite.
Proof. Assume that X is D–inﬁnite. Then there exists an injection f : N →X.
Consequently the collection A = {{f(m) | m ≥n} | n ∈N} of subsets of X is
non–empty, but contains no minimal element. Thus X is inﬁnite.
The converse, however, is not true. I.e., there exist models of ZF in which
there exist inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite sets16
When do the two ﬁniteness–concepts coincide? Precisely, if the disasters
of 4.3 do not occur. The following Lemma will prepare the ground for the

Lemma 4.11. Equivalent are:
1. ℵ0 ≤∗|X|, i.e., there exists a surjection X →N.
2. PX is D–inﬁnite, i.e., there exists an injection N →PX.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let f : X →N be a surjection. Then the map g: N →PX,
deﬁned by g(n) = f −1(n), is an injection.
(2) ⇒(1) Let f : N →PX be an injection. Deﬁne recursively a map
g: N →PX such that the g(n)’s are non–void and pairwise disjoint: For
n ∈N, assume that the g(m)’s are deﬁned for all m < n such that the set
{f(k) \ 
m<n
g(m) | k ≥n} is inﬁnite. Deﬁne
n∗= min{k | k ≥n and f(k) \

m<n
g(m) ̸= ∅̸= (X \ f(k)) \

m<n
g(m)}.
In case {f(k) \ (f(n∗) ∪
m<n
g(m)) | k > n∗} is inﬁnite, deﬁne
g(n) = f(n∗) \ 
m<n
g(m); otherwise deﬁne g(n) = X \ (f(n∗) \ 
m<n
g(m)).
The so deﬁned g: N →PX has the required properties. Thus the map h: X →
N, deﬁned by h(x) =
n, if x ∈g(n)
0, if x ̸∈
n∈N
g(n) , is a surjection.
Theorem 4.12. Equivalent are:
1. Finite = D–ﬁnite.
2. D–ﬁnite unions of D–ﬁnite sets are D–ﬁnite.
3. Images of D–ﬁnite sets are D–ﬁnite.
4. The power set of each D–ﬁnite set is D–ﬁnite.
5. For each set X we have ℵ0 ≤|X| or |X| ≤ℵ0.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Proposition 4.7.
(2) ⇒(3) Let f : X →Y be a surjection with D–ﬁnite domain X. Then
Y = 
x∈X
{f(x)} is a D–ﬁnite union of D–ﬁnite sets, thus D–ﬁnite.
(3) ⇒(4) Assume that PX is D–inﬁnite. Then, by Lemma 4.11, there
exists a surjection f : X →N. Since N is D–inﬁnite, (3) implies that X is
D–inﬁnite.
(4) ⇒(1) It suﬃces to show that each inﬁnite set X is D–inﬁnite. The
map f : N →PPX, deﬁned by f(n) = {A ⊆X | |A| = n} is injective. Thus
PPX is D–inﬁnite. Hence (4) implies that PX is D–inﬁnite. Hence, by (4)
again, X is D–inﬁnite.
(1) ⇔(5) Straightforward.
Observe that D–ﬁnite sets can possibly be quite “large”. If X is D–ﬁnite
and PX is D–inﬁnite, then ℵ0 ≤∗|X| by 4.11. Moreover, Monro17 has shown
17
[Mon75]

48
4 Disasters without Choice
that it is consistent to assume that for any ℵα (no matter how large) there
exist D–ﬁnite sets X with ℵα ≤∗|X|.
AC implies that
ﬁnite = D–ﬁnite. CC suﬃces:
Proposition 4.13. Under CC, ﬁnite = D–ﬁnite.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that each inﬁnite set X is D–inﬁnite. If X is inﬁnite
then, for each n ∈N, the set Xn of all injective n–tuples (x1, . . . , xn) in X is
non–empty. Thus, by CC, there exists an element (yn) ∈
n
Xn. Concatenation
of the yn’s yields a sequence (xn) in X with inﬁnite range (precisely: if yn =
(x1
n, . . . , xn
n), then xn (n+1)
2
+k = xk
n+1 for n ∈N and k ∈{1, . . . , n + 1}).
Cancellation of repeatedly occurring terms yields an injection f : N →X
(precisely: f(n) = xmin{k|xk̸∈{f(m)|m<n}}). Thus X is D–inﬁnite.
However, there are models18 of ZF that satisfy the equation ﬁnite = D–ﬁnite,
but fail to satisfy CC. For other models19 the equation ﬁnite = D–ﬁnite even
fails for subsets of R.
Though in general the classes of all ﬁnite sets and of all D–ﬁnite sets are
diﬀerent, the ﬁrst of these classes is completely determined by the latter.
Proposition 4.14. 20 Equivalent are:
1. X is ﬁnite,
2. PPX is D–ﬁnite.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Immediate from Propositions 4.10 and 4.8.
(2) ⇒(1) Assume X to be inﬁnite. Then the map f : N →PPX, deﬁned
by
f(n) = {A ⊆X | |A| = n}
is injective. Thus PPX is D–inﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 4.15. Cardinal numbers of inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite sets are called Dedek-
ind cardinals.
By Proposition 4.13, CC implies that there are no Dedekind cardinals.
However, the next result, which we present without proof, shows that if there
is at least one Dedekind cardinal, then there is a multitude of them with
rather bizarre properties:

What remains is to show that given two sets A and B, one is
less than or equal to the other. If one thinks of this problem for
two “arbitrary” sets, one sees the hopelessness of trying to actually
deﬁne a map from one into the other. I believe that almost anyone
would have a feeling of unease about this problem; namely that,
since nothing is given about the sets, it is impossible to begin to
deﬁne a speciﬁc mapping. This intuition is, of course, what lies
behind the fact that it is unprovable in the usual Zermelo–Fraenkel
set theory.

The unwelcome phenomenon, described above, has been illustrated by Rus-
sell by means of a sequence of pairs of boots, where the right and left boots
of each pair are distinguishable, and a sequence of pairs of socks, where the
right and left socks of each pair are indistinguishable; and thus in the latter
case “we cannot choose one out of each of an inﬁnite number of pairs unless
we have a rule of choice, and in the present case no rule can be found.”30
Even more dramatic is the fact that already in the ﬁnite case undesired
phenomena may occur. E.g., cardinals may no longer be comparable.
Deﬁnition 4.18. 31 Cardinals a and b are called comparable w.r.t. ≤(resp.
w.r.t. ≤∗) iﬀa ≤b or b ≤a (resp. a ≤∗b or b ≤∗a).
Disaster 4.19. It can happen that:
1. There are cardinals a and b with a ≤∗b and a ≰b.
2. There exist cardinals a and b that are incomparable w.r.t. ≤.
3. There exist cardinals a and b that are incomparable w.r.t. ≤∗.
4. There exist cardinals a and b with a ≤∗b, b ≤∗a, and a ̸= b.
Proof. (1) If in a model of ZF there exists an inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite set X (see
Section 4.1), then there exists (see Exercises to Section 4.1, E 5) a cardinal
a with ℵ0 ≤∗a and ℵ0 ≰a. [Hint: If PX is D–inﬁnite, choose a = |X|,
otherwise choose a = |PX|.]
(2) Let X be a set that cannot be well–ordered and let ℵbe the Hartogs–
number of X. Then ℵ≰|X|, by deﬁnition; and |X| ≰ℵ, since otherwise X
would be well–orderable.
(3) See the following theorem.
(4) See Theorem 7.21(3).
Theorem 4.20. 32 Equivalent are:
1. Any two cardinals are comparable w.r.t. ≤.
2. Any two cardinals are comparable w.r.t. ≤∗.

Proof. (1) ⇒(2) follows from the trivial fact that a ≤b implies a ≤∗b.
(2) ⇒(3) Let X be an arbitrary set. Then |Y | ≤∗|X| for some set Y
implies |Y | ≤|PX|. Thus the Hartogs–number ℵof PX satisﬁes ℵ≰∗|X|. By

(2), this implies |X| ≤∗ℵ, i.e., (for X ̸= ∅) there exists a surjection f : ℵ→X.
Deﬁne a map g: X →ℵby g(x) = min f −1(x). Then g is injective. Thus X
is well–orderable. Thus (3) holds.
(3) ⇒(1) Let X and Y be arbitrary sets. By (3), X and Y can be well–
ordered. As well–ordered sets they are either order–isomorphic or one of them
is order–isomorphic to an initial segment of the other. Thus |X| = |Y | or
|X| ≤|Y | or |Y | ≤|X|.
In view of the above theorem, sets of cardinals may fail to be linearly
ordered, and thus fail to be well–ordered with respect to either the order
relations ≤or ≤∗. Does at least every cardinal have a direct successor?
W.r.t. ≤the following two theorems, that we include without proof,
present two sharply contrasting answers:
Theorem 4.21. 33 Every cardinal a has a minimal successor w.r.t. ≤, namely
•
a + 1, if a is ﬁnite,
•
a + ℵ, if a is inﬁnite and ℵis the Hartogs–number of a.
As we will see in Theorem 7.22, a cardinal may have several minimal
successors.
Theorem 4.22. 34 Equivalent are:
1. Every cardinal has a smallest successor w.r.t. ≤.
2. AC.
Moreover, in ZF cardinal arithmetic tumbles. Whereas in ZFC, addition
and multiplication, restricted to inﬁnite cardinals a and b, are trivial opera-
tions satisfying
a · b = a + b = max{a, b}
hence in particular
a2 = 2 · a = a,
in ZF addition and multiplication are as simple as above just for Alephs, but
no longer so for arbitrary inﬁnite cardinals.
Lemma 4.23. 35 If a · ℵ= a + ℵfor some cardinal a and some Aleph ℵ, then
a and ℵare comparable, w.r.t. ≤.
Proof. Let A be a set with |A| = a, let W be a well–ordered set, disjoint
from A, with |W| = ℵ, and let f : A × W →A ∪W be a bijection. Consider
¯A = f −1[A] and ¯W = f −1[W]. Then | ¯A| = a and | ¯W| = ℵ.

Case 1: There exists ¯a ∈A with ({¯a} × W) ⊆¯A.
Then ℵ= |W| = |{¯a} × W| ≤| ¯A| = a, thus ℵ≤a.
Case 2: For each a ∈A, Wa = {w ∈W | (a, w) ∈¯W} ̸= ∅.
Then each set Wa has a smallest element wa. Hence:
a = |A| = |{(a, wa) | a ∈A}| ≤| ¯W| = ℵ,
thus a ≤ℵ.
Theorem 4.24. 36 Equivalent are:
1. a2 = a for all inﬁnite cardinals a.
2. a · b = a + b for all inﬁnite cardinals a and b.
3. AC.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) a + b ≤a · b ≤a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2 = a + b. Thus
a + b = a · b.
(2) ⇒(3) Let A be an inﬁnite set with |A| = a, and let ℵbe the Hartogs–
number of A. By (2), a · ℵ= a + ℵ. Thus by Lemma 4.23, a and ℵare
comparable w.r.t. ≤. Since ℵ≰a, by deﬁnition, we conclude that a < ℵ.
Thus A is well–orderable. This implies (3).
(3) ⇒(1) Let A be an inﬁnite set with |A| = a. By (3), A has a countable
inﬁnite subset N. Obviously, there exists a bijection f : N →N 2. Consider the
set M of all pairs (M, g), where N ⊆M ⊆A and g: M →M 2 is a bijection.
Order M by
(M, g) ≤(K, h) ⇔(M ⊆K and g is a restriction of h).
Then, in the ordered set (M, ≤), each chain has an upper bound. Thus (3), via
Zorn’s Lemma, implies that (M, ≤) has a maximal element (B, g). Consider,
C = A \ B, |B| = b, and |C| = c.
Case 1: c ≤b.
Then a ≤a2 = (b2 + b · c + c · b + c2) ≤4b2 = 4b ≤b2 = b ≤a.
Thus a = a2.
Case 2: b ≤c.
Then there exists a subset D of C with |D| = b. Consider E =
(B ∪D)2 \ B2 and e = |E|. Then b = |D| ≤|D2| ≤e = 3b2 =
3b ≤b2 = b.
Thus e = b. Consequently there exists a bijection h = D →E. Thus
the map k: (B ∪D) →(B ∪D)2, deﬁned by k(x) =

g(x), if x ∈B
h(x), if x ∈D , is a
bijection that extends g: B →B2. This contradicts the maximality of (B, g).
Thus Case 2 cannot occur.

The above theorem, due to Tarski, has a remarkable history concerning
its publication. Moore37 relates in his book, p. 215, the following story com-
municated to him by Tarski himself:
“Before these results appeared in Fundamenta Mathematica in 1924,
Tarski sent Lebesgue a note showing that (4.3.2) [i.e., condition (1)
of the above theorem] is equivalent to the Axiom, and asked him to
submit it to the Comptes Rendus of the Paris Academy of Sciences.
Lebesgue returned the note on the grounds that he opposed the Axiom,
but suggested sending it to Hadamard. When Tarski did as Lebesgue
advised, Hadamard also returned the note — saying that, since the
Axiom was true, what was the point of proving it from (4.3.2)?”

4.3 Disasters in Order Theory
Linearly ordered sets may have unfamiliar properties (cf. Exercise E 1).
Disaster 4.25. The following can happen in a linearly ordered set, even in a
subset X of R:
1. X contains no decreasing sequence, but fails to be well–ordered.
2. X is inﬁnite but contains neither a decreasing42 nor an increasing42 se-
quence.
3. X is non–empty and without a largest element, but contains no increasing
sequence.
Proof. Let X be an inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite subset of R, supplied with its natural
order43. Then X contains neither an increasing nor a decreasing sequence. X
is not well–ordered, since otherwise we could deﬁne an increasing sequence
(xn) via recursion by
xn is the smallest element of X \ {xm | m < n}.
In case X has a largest element, there exists a ﬁnite set F such that
Y = X\F is an inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite set without a largest element, since otherwise
we could deﬁne a decreasing sequence (xn) in X via recursion by:
xn is the largest element of X \ {xm | m < n}.
Disaster 4.26. A partially ordered set may have neither a maximal chain nor
a maximal antichain.

[Haeu83]

A sequence (xn) in an ordered set is called decreasing (resp. increasing) provided
that xn+1 < xn (resp. xn < xn+1) for each n ∈N.
43
Such sets exist in certain models of ZF, e.g. in Cohen’s First Model A4 (M1 in
[HoRu98]).

4.3 Disasters in Order Theory
57
Proof. Immediate from Theorems 2.2 and 2.4.
Next, let us turn our attention to the question whether lattices have maxi-
mal ﬁlters. For convenience we adopt the following slightly restricted deﬁnition
of lattices44.
Deﬁnition 4.27. A lattice is a partially ordered set L in which each ﬁnite
subset F has an inﬁmum, inf F, and a supremum, sup F, (in particular L has
a smallest element, 0 = sup ∅, and a largest element, 1 = inf ∅) and such that
0 ̸= 1.
Deﬁnition 4.28. A lattice L is called
1. distributive, provided it satisﬁes the equation x∧(y ∨z) = (x∧y)∨(x∧z)
for all x, y, and z (and thus also the equation x∨(y∧z) = (x∨y)∧(x∨z)).
2. complete, provided that each of its subsets has a supremum (and thus also
an inﬁmum).
3. a powerset–lattice, provided L is isomorphic to the lattice of all subsets of
some non–empty set,
4. an open lattice, provided that L is isomorphic to the lattice τ(X) of all
open sets of some non–empty topological space,
5. a closed lattice, provided that L is isomorphic to the lattice γ(X) of all
closed sets of some non–empty topological space X.
Deﬁnition 4.29.
1. A subset F of a lattice L is called a ﬁlter in L iﬀthe
following two conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) 1 ∈F and 0 ̸∈F.
(b) (x ∧y) ∈F iﬀ(x ∈F and y ∈F).
2. A ﬁlter F in L is called maximal iﬀL has no properly larger ﬁlter than
F.
3. A ﬁlter F in L is called prime iﬀit satisﬁes the condition
(c) (x ∨y) ∈F ⇔(x ∈F or y ∈F).
4. A ﬁlter (resp. maximal ﬁlter) in the powerset–lattice of a set X is also
called a ﬁlter (resp. ultraﬁlter) on X.
Dual concepts: ideal, maximal ideal, prime ideal.
Observe that for distributive lattices every maximal ﬁlter is prime. How-
ever, the lattice
◦


◦ ◦
◦

◦
has precisely 4 ﬁlters, 3 of which are maximal, but
none is prime.
In the lattice τ(R) of open sets in R, for each x ∈R the ﬁlter
F(x) = {A ∈τ(R) | x ∈A} is prime but not maximal. For Boolean algebras,
in particular for powerset–lattices, a ﬁlter is prime iﬀit is maximal.
44
By standard terminology our lattices would have to be called non–trivial
bounded lattices.

Do lattices have maximal ﬁlters? In the case of powerset–lattices of the
form P(X) the obvious answer is “yes”, since for each x ∈X the set
•x =
{F ⊆X | x ∈F} is an ultraﬁlter on X. Ultraﬁlters F of this simple type are
called ﬁxed (since  F ̸= ∅), all others are called free (since their intersection
is empty). Are there any free ultraﬁlters on X? For ﬁnite X, obviously not.
However, for inﬁnite X there are 22|X| free ultraﬁlters on X — provided that
we work in ZFC. However, in ZF the situation is very diﬀerent:
Disaster 4.30. The following might happen:
1. There are no free ultraﬁlters.
2. There are free ultraﬁlters on some sets, but there is none on N.
3. There are free ultraﬁlters on every inﬁnite set, but not every ﬁlter F on
a set X can be enlarged to an ultraﬁlter on X.
4. There are sets with precisely one free ultraﬁlter.
Proof. (1), (2) see [Bla77] or Pincus–Solovay’s Model A6 (M27 in [HoRu98]).
(3) is true in Fraenkel’s First Model A7 (N1 in [HoRu98]).
(4) See Exercise E 4.
What about the existence of maximal ﬁlters in one of the wider classes
of lattices deﬁned above? In the case of all lattices, the following proposition
provides an answer.
Proposition 4.31. 45 Equivalent are:
1. Every lattice has a maximal ﬁlter.
2. AC.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty sets. Consider the
set of all pairs (J, x) with J ⊆I and x ∈
j∈J
Xj, ordered by
(J, x) ≤(K, y) iﬀ(J ⊆K and x is the restriction of y to J).
By adding a largest element 1, a lattice L results. By (1), the dual lattice
has a maximal ﬁlter, thus L itself has a maximal ideal M. For (J, x) and
(K, y) in M, the inequality (J, x) ∨(K, y) ̸= 1 implies that xi = yi for each
i ∈(J ∩K). Thus the union of all the ﬁrst components of members of M is a
subset K of I, and the union of all the second components of members of M
is an element x of 
k∈K
Xk. Maximality of M implies K = I. Thus x ∈
i∈I
Xi.
(2) ⇒(1) Immediate via Zorn’s Lemma.
There is a deeper result: In condition (1) of the above proof the collection
of all lattices can be reduced considerably.

Theorem 4.32. 46 Equivalent are:
1. Every lattice has a maximal ﬁlter.
2. Every complete lattice has a maximal ﬁlter.
3. Every distributive lattice has a maximal ﬁlter.
4. Every closed lattice has a maximal ﬁlter.
5. AC.
Proof. In view of Proposition 4.31 and the fact that every closed lattice is
complete and distributive it suﬃces to show that (4) implies (5):
(4) ⇒(5) Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty sets. For each i ∈I, add
a new element ∞to Xi, and consider Yi = Xi ∪{∞} as a topological space
whose collection of closed sets is
γ(Xi) = {Yi} ∪{A ⊆Xi | A ﬁnite}.
Then the product space Y = 
i∈I
Yi is non–empty, hence its lattice γ(Y ) of
closed sets contains a maximal ﬁlter F. For each i ∈I denote the i–th pro-
jection by πi : Y →Yi, and deﬁne Fi = {A ∈γ(Xi) | π−1
i
[A] ∈F}. Then each
Fi is a prime ﬁlter in γ(Xi). Deﬁne J = {i ∈I | Fi = {Yi}} and K = I \ J.
For each k ∈K there exists a unique element xk ∈Xk with {xk} ∈Fk. Thus
(xk)k∈K ∈
k∈K
Xk. It remains to be shown that K = I, i.e., J = ∅. Deﬁne
y = (yi)i∈I ∈Y by
yi =

xi, if i ∈K
∞, if i ∈J
.
Consider i ∈I and a neighborhood U of yi in Yi. Then π−1
i
[U] meets every
member of F. (This is obvious for i ∈K. It holds for i ∈J, since otherwise
there would exist some ﬁnite subset A of Xi in Fi, contradicting the deﬁnition
of J.) Since F is prime, this implies that every neighborhood of y meets every
member of F. Since F consists of closed sets only, this implies that y ∈ F
and hence cl{y} ⊆ F is the product of the closures of its components47, i.e.,
cl{y} = 
i∈I
cli{yi} = 
i∈I
Zi, with
Zi =

{xi}, if i ∈K
Yi,
if i ∈J
.
In view of the maximality of F this implies J = ∅, since otherwise for a ﬁxed
j ∈J and a ﬁxed x ∈Xj the ﬁlter in γ(Y ), generated by the set π−1
j (x),
would be properly larger than F. Thus y ∈

Corollary 4.33. Equivalent are:
1. In every lattice each ﬁlter can be enlarged to a maximal one.
2. In every closed lattice every ﬁlter can be enlarged to a maximal one.
Observe that the space Y , constructed in the proof of Theorem 4.32 is a
T0–space, but fails to be a T1–space. In fact, for non–empty T1–spaces X the
corresponding closed lattices γ(X) always have maximal closed ﬁlters, namely
•x = {A ∈γ(X) | x ∈A}, for each x ∈X.
The open lattices τ(X) are just the duals of the corresponding closed
lattices γ(X). So one might expect similar results. Surprisingly, however, the
statement that each open lattice contains a maximal ﬁlter is weaker than AC.
Deﬁnition 4.34. Let X be a topological space and A ∈τ(X). Then
A∗= int(X \ A),
the interior of the complement of A, is called the pseudocomplement of A.
Lemma 4.35. Let X be a topological space, A ∈τ(X), and F a ﬁlter in τ(X).
Then the following hold:
1. A∗is the largest element of τ(X) that misses A.
2. F is maximal iﬀthe following condition is satisﬁed:
(*) For each A ∈τ(X), either A ∈F or A∗∈F.
Proof. (1) is trivial.
(2) Let F be maximal and let A be an element of τ(X) that does not
belong to F. Then, by maximality of F, there exists a member F of F with
F ∩A = ∅. Thus F ⊆A∗. This implies A∗∈F.
Now, let F satisfy the condition (*) and let G be a ﬁlter in τ(X) with
F ⊆G. For G ∈G we have either G ∈F or G∗∈F. The latter case G∗∈F
cannot happen, since otherwise G and G∗, and thus ∅= G∩G∗, would belong
to G. Thus G ∈F, hence G ⊆F, hence G = F.
Theorem 4.36. 48 Equivalent are:
1. Every open lattice has a maximal ﬁlter.
2. In every open lattice, every ﬁlter can be enlarged to a maximal one.
3. UFT, the Ultraﬁlter Theorem.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let X be a topological space, and let F be a ﬁlter in τ(X).
Let Y be the topological space, whose underlying set (also denoted by Y )
consists of all ﬁlters in τ(X) that enlarge F, and whose topology consists of
all subsets of Y that contain with any element G all elements of Y that enlarge
G. By (1), there exists a maximal ﬁlter M in τ(Y ). For each A ∈τ(X) deﬁne

4.3 Disasters in Order Theory
61
U(A) = {G ∈Y | A ∈G}.
Then U = {A ∈τ(X) | U(A) ∈M} is an element of Y . Maximality of
U will follow, by 4.35 from the fact that for each A ∈τ(X) either A or its
pseudocomplement A∗belongs to U. To establish the latter fact, observe ﬁrst
that if A ̸∈U, i.e., if U(A) ̸∈M, maximality of M implies that there is some
M ∈M with M ∩U(A) = ∅. Thus A ̸∈G for each G ∈M. This implies
A∗∈G for each G ∈M, since A∗̸∈G ∈M would imply that each member of
G would meet A, hence there would exist an enlargement H of G — hence a
member H of M — with A ∈H; a contradiction.
Consequently M ⊆U(A∗). This implies U(A∗) ∈M, thus A∗∈U.
(2) ⇒(3) Immediate, since (3) is the restriction of (2) to discrete spaces.
(3) ⇒(1) Let X be a non–empty topological space (whose underlying
set we also denote by X). Consider the ﬁlter F ⊆τ(X) consisting of all
F ∈τ(X) that are dense in the space X. Then F can be enlarged to a ﬁlter G
on the set X, and, by (3), we may assume that G is an ultraﬁlter on X. Thus
H = G ∩τ(X) is a prime ﬁlter in τ(X) that enlarges F. For each A ∈τ(X)
the set A ∪A∗is dense in X and thus belongs to F, hence to H. Since H is
prime, this implies that A ∈H or A∗∈H. By 4.35, this implies that H is
maximal in τ(X).
For the following result we regard 2 as a Boolean lattice with underlying
set {0, 1} and 0 < 1. Obviously, a subset F of a Boolean algebra B is a prime
ﬁlter in B iﬀthe map f : B →2, deﬁned by f(x) =

1, if x ∈F
0, otherwise , is a
Boolean homomorphism.
Theorem 4.37. 49 Equivalent are:
1. PIT the Prime Ideal Theorem: every Boolean lattice has a maximal
ﬁlter50.
2. In a Boolean lattice, every ﬁlter can be enlarged to a maximal one.
3. UFT, the Ultraﬁlter Theorem.
4. Products of compact Hausdorﬀspaces are compact.
5. Products of ﬁnite discrete spaces are compact.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let F be a ﬁlter in a Boolean lattice B. Let f : B →B/F
the natural map from B onto the corresponding quotient space of B, with
f −1(1) = F. By (1), there exists a maximal ﬁlter G in B/F. Then f −1[G] is
a maximal ﬁlter in B that enlarges F.
(2) ⇒(3) Immediate, since (3) is the restriction of (2) to powerset–
lattices.
49
[RuSc54], [LoRy55], [Ban79].
50
Since the concept of Boolean lattice is self–dual, and since in Boolean lattices
the concepts of maximal and prime ﬁlters coincide, the above formulation is
obviously equivalent to the one given in Section 2.2.

62
4 Disasters without Choice
(3) ⇒(4) By Theorem 3.22, (3) implies that a topological space X is
compact iﬀevery ultraﬁlter in X converges. Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of compact
Hausdorﬀspaces, let X = 
i∈I
Xi be their product, and let U be an ultraﬁlter
on X. Then, for each i ∈I, the set Ui = {A ⊆Xi | π−1
i
[A] ∈U} is an
ultraﬁlter on Xi (where πi denotes the i–th projection). Since Xi is compact
and Hausdorﬀ, Ui converges to a unique element xi in Xi. Thus U converges
to x = (xi)i∈I.
(4) ⇒(5) Trivial.
(5) ⇒(1) Let B be a Boolean lattice. Consider the set A of all ﬁnite
Boolean subalgebras of B. For A ∈A the set XA of all Boolean homomor-
phisms from A to 2 is non–empty (since obviously each ﬁnite Boolean lattice
has a maximal ﬁlter). Consider each XA as a discrete topological space. By
(5), the product space X =

A∈A
XA is compact and non–empty51. For any
pair (A, B) of elements of A with A ⊆B the set
C(A, B) = {(xC) ∈X | xA is the restriction of xB to A}
is closed in X, and the sets C(A, B) have the ﬁnite intersection property.
Since X is compact, there exists an element x = (xC) in the intersection
of all C(A, B)’s. For a ∈B, let B(a) be the ﬁnite subalgebra of B gener-
ated by a. Then the map f : B →2, deﬁned by f(a) = xB(a) is a Boolean
homomorphism. Thus f −1(1) is a maximal ﬁlter in B.
Finally, let us investigate the question whether or not every set can be
nicely ordered. We know already that it may not be possible to well–order
some set X. But it is easily seen that each set can be partially ordered, even
lattice–ordered, provided it has at least 2 elements (see Exercise E 7). Can it
be linearly ordered?
Disaster 4.38. It can happen that certain sets cannot be linearly ordered.
The next result provides some indication of what may go wrong.
Proposition 4.39. 52 Each of the following conditions implies all subsequent
ones:
1. UFT.
2. OEP, the Order Extension Principle: for each partially ordered set
(X, R) there exists a linear order relation S on X with R ⊆S.
3. OP, the Ordering Principle: each set can be linearly ordered.
4. AC(ﬁn): Products of non–empty, ﬁnite sets are non–empty.
51
The non–emptiness follows immediately from the fact that the product 
A∈A
YA
of the discrete spaces YA = XA ∪{∞} is compact.

4.3 Disasters in Order Theory
63
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let (X, R) be an partially ordered set. For each ﬁnite subset
F of X let XF be the set of all linear order relation S on F with (R∩F 2) ⊆S.
Then each XF , with F ∈Pﬁn(X), is a non–empty ﬁnite set (cf. Exercise E
9.(2)). Consider it as a discrete topological space. Then, by (1), the space
Y =

F ∈Pfin(X)
XF is — according to Theorem 4.37 — a non–empty compact
space. For any pair (E, F) of ﬁnite subsets of X deﬁne a set
A(E,F ) = {(SG)G∈Pfin(X) | SE ∩(E ∩F)2 = SF ∩(E ∩F)2}.
Then the sets A(E,F ) are non–empty and closed in Y ; and they have the
ﬁnite–intersection property. Thus their intersection contains an element
(SG)G∈Pfin(X), which implies that S =

G∈Pfin(X)
SG is a linear order relation
on X with R ⊆S.
(2) ⇒(3) By (2), the partial order relation on X deﬁned by x ≤y ⇔x = y
can be extended to a linear order relation on X.
(3) ⇒(4) Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty, ﬁnite sets. By (3),
X = 
i∈I
Xi can be linearly ordered. Thus each Xi has a smallest element xi
in X. Consequently (xi) ∈
i∈I
Xi.
Proposition 4.40. 53 The Kinna–Wagner Selection Principle, KW, implies
the Ordering Principle, OP.
Proof. Let X be a set. Consider the collection P2(X) of all subsets A of X
with |A| ≥2. By KW, there exists a family (AY )Y ∈P2(X) of non–empty,
proper subsets AY of X. Denote X \ AY by BY . Consider the set Z of all
linear preorder relations R on X. For each R in Z and each x in X consider
the component [x]R = {y ∈X | xRy and yRx} of x in (X, R). Let KR be the
set of all components [x]R of (X, R) with at least two elements. Let ℵbe the
Hartogs–number of Z, and deﬁne, via transﬁnite recursion, a map f : ℵ→Z
by
1. f(0) = X × X,
2. f(α + 1) = f(α) \ {BK × AK | K ∈Kf(α)},
3. f(α) = 
β<α
f(β), if α is a limit ordinal.
Since ℵ≰|Z|, f cannot be injective. Thus there exists some α ∈ℵwith
f(α + 1) = f(α). For this α, Kf(α) must be empty, i.e., f(α) is a linear order
relation on X.

4.4 Disasters in Algebra I: Vector Spaces
In ZFC every vector space is uniquely determined, up to isomorphism, by a
single cardinal number, its dimension. Each of the two fundamental results
which together enable us to associate dimension with a given vector space fail
badly in ZF.
Disaster 4.42. 59 The following can happen:
1. Vector spaces may have no bases60.
2. Vector spaces may have two bases with diﬀerent cardinalities.
Even stranger phenomena may haunt us:

Observe, however, that the existence of a basis for every vector space may,
besides desirable consequences, also have some rather ugly ones. See Section
5.1.

4.4 Disasters in Algebra I: Vector Spaces
67
Disaster 4.43. 61 The following can happen:
1. In a vector space no non–trivial linear subspace need have a complement.
2. A vector space may have only ﬁnite–dimensional proper subspaces, but
fail to be ﬁnite–dimensional itself.
Theorem 4.44. 62 Equivalent are:
1. Every vector space has a basis.
2. AC.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) In view of Theorem 2.4 it suﬃces to show that (1) implies
AMC. Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of pairwise disjoint non–empty sets. Consider
an arbitrary ﬁeld k and let k(X) be the ﬁeld of rational functions in the
variables x ∈X = 
i∈I
Xi over k. For monomials, i.e., elements of k(X) which
have the form p = α·xn1
1 ·xn2
2 · · · xnm
m , we deﬁne, for each i ∈I, the i–degree of
p as di(p) =

xk∈Xi
nk. An element of k(X), α = p1+···+pn
q1+···+qm where the pk and qk
are monomials, will be called i–homogeneous of degree d provided that all qk
have the same i–degree, say d1, and all pk have the same i–degree d2 = d1 +d.
Then K = {a ∈k(X) | a is i–homogeneous of degree 0 for each i ∈I} is a
subﬁeld of k(X). Thus k(X) is a vector space over K. By (1), k(X) has a basis
B. For each x ∈X the monomial x can be expressed uniquely in the form
x =

b∈B(x)
ab(x)·b, where B(x) is a ﬁnite subset of B and each ab(x) ∈K\{0}.
Let x and y be elements of the same Xi. Then
y = y
x · x =

b∈B(x)
y
x · ab(x) · b =

b∈B(y)
ab(y) · b.
Since y
x ∈K, this implies B(x) = B(y) and ab(y)
y
= ab(x)
x
for each b ∈B(x).
Thus the sets B(x) and the elements ab(x)
x
depend only on i, and not on the
particular x in Xi. Let us call them Bi resp. α(b, i). Since the ab(x) are i–
homogeneous of degree 0, the α(b, i) = ab(x)
x
are i–homogeneous of degree −1.
Thus, if α(b, i) is written as a quotient of polynomials in reduced form, some
x ∈Xi must occur in the denominator. Hence the set Fi, consisting of all
x ∈Xi that occur in the denominator of α(b, i) in its reduced form for some
b ∈Bi, is a non–empty, ﬁnite subset of Xi. This establishes AMC.
(2) ⇒(1) is well known.
Theorem 4.45. 63 For each ﬁeld k, the following are equivalent:
1. Every subspace S of a vector space V over k has a linear complement S′

Proof. (1) ⇒(2) In view of Theorem 2.4 it suﬃces to show that (1) implies
AMC. Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of pairwise disjoint non–empty sets. For each
i ∈I let Vi = k(Xi) be the direct sum of Xi copies of k, with the canonical base
(ex)x∈Xi. Let Si be the linear subspace of Vi, consisting of all v = 

αxex
in Vi with 
x∈Xi
αx = 0.
Consider the direct sum S = 
i∈I
Si as a linear subspace of the direct sum
V = 
i∈I
Vi. By (1), there exists a linear subspace S′ of V with S ∩S′ = {0}
and S + S′ = V For any x ∈Xi consider the element ex from the canonical
base of Vi as an element of V . Then there exist unique elements s(x) in S and
s′(x) in S′ with ex = s(x) + s′(x). If x and y belong to the same Xi, then
s′(x) −s′(y) = (ex −s(x)) −(ey −s(y)) = (ex −ey) + (s(y) −s(x)) belongs
to S′ and to S, since (ex −ey) ∈Si. Therefore s′(x) = s′(y). This element
depends only on i and not on the particular x in Xi. Let us call it s′
i.
Let s′
i = 
j∈I
vj with vj ∈Vj, and vi =

x∈Xi

vj = (ex −vi) −

vj ∈S, we conclude

αx = 0, hence Fi ̸= ∅. This establishes AMC.

We may ask whether, like in Theorem 4.45, we can restrict attention in
Theorem 4.44 to vector spaces over R resp. Q. The answer to these questions
is unknown. However, there is a slightly weaker result in the case of Q.
Lemma 4.46. Let k be a ﬁeld. If for every vector space V over k every gen-
erating set contains a basis, then for each family (Vi)i∈I of vector spaces over
k and each family (Gi)i∈I of generating sets Gi of Vi there exists a family
(Bi)i∈I of bases Bi of Vi with Bi ⊆Gi for each i ∈I.
Proof. Let V = 
i∈I
Vi be the direct sum of the Vi’s, with canonical inclusion
maps ji : Vi →V . Then G = 
i∈I
ji[Gi] is a generating set for V . Let B ⊆G be
a basis for V . Then Bi = {x ∈Vi | ji(x) ∈B} is a basis for Vi with Bi ⊆Gi
for each i ∈I.
Theorem 4.47. 64 Equivalent are:
1. In every vector space over Q each generating set contains a basis.
2. AC.

Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Again by Theorem 2.4 it suﬃces to show that (1) implies
AMC. Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty sets. Assume w.l.o.g. that each
Xi contains at least two elements. For each i ∈I, let Vi be the linear subspace
of the product space QXi, consisting of all (αx)x∈Xi that are almost constant,
i.e., for which there exists a ﬁnite subset F of Xi such that (αx)x∈(Xi\F ) is a
constant family. Each Vi is generated by the set Gi, consisting of all elements
v = (αx)x∈Xi of Vi such that there exists exactly one element x = x(v) in Xi
such that (αy)y∈(Xi\{x}) is a constant family.
By (1) and Lemma 4.46 there exists a family (Bi)i∈I of bases Bi of Vi
with Bi ⊆Gi. For each i ∈I consider the element ai = (αx)x∈Xi with each
αx = 1.
Then there exists a unique non–empty, ﬁnite subset B′
i of Bi such that ai
is expressible as a linear combination
ai =

b∈B′
i
αbb with each αb ∈(Q \ {0}).
Thus Fi = {x(b) | b ∈B′
i} is a non–empty ﬁnite subset of Xi. This establishes
AMC.
(2) ⇒(1) is well known.
Returning to statement (2) of Disaster 4.42, no choice principle is known
that is equivalent to the statement that any two bases of a vector space have
the same cardinality. However, the latter fact follows already from PIT65.
In ZFC every vector space is injective66 and projective67. Since projectivity
of V follows from V being free (i.e., V has a basis), Theorem 4.44 casts doubt
on the idea that in ZF every vector space is projective. The situation is even
worse:
Disaster 4.48.
1. Vector spaces may fail to be injective.
2. Vector spaces, even free ones, may fail to be projective.
Theorem 4.49. For each ﬁeld k, the following are equivalent:
1. Every vector space over k is injective.
2. Every vector space over k is projective.
3. Every free vector space over k is projective.

Proof. Since clearly (4) ⇒(1), (4) ⇒(2), and (2) ⇒(3) it suﬃces to show
that
(1) ⇒(4) and (3) ⇒(4).

is a linear complement of A in V .
(3) ⇒(4) Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty sets. Let X = {(i, x) |
i ∈I and x ∈Xi} be the disjoint union of the Xi’s. Let F(I) = k(I) resp.
F(X) = k(X) be the direct sums of I resp. X copies of k (i.e., the canonical
free k–vector spaces over I resp. X). Then the map f : X →I, deﬁned by
f(i, x) = i, induces a linear map ¯f : F(X) →F(I). Since f is surjective, so
is ¯f. Thus, by projectivity of the free vector space F(I), there exists a linear
map g: F(I) →F(X) such that the diagram

Thus (Fi)i∈I is a family of non–empty, ﬁnite subsets Fi of Xi. Consequently

Category theory heavily depends on choice principles. In ZF, already the basic
Adjoint Functor Theorems fail dramatically:
Disaster 4.50. 71
1. The Adjoint Functor Theorem fails, i.e., there exists a limit–preserving
functor G: A →B with complete domain which satisﬁes the solution–
set–condition, but has no coadjoint.
2. The Special Adjoint Functor Theorem fails, i.e., there exists a strongly
complete category A with a coseparator and a functor G: A →B that
preserves strong limits, but has no coadjoint.
3. There exists a functor G: A →B such that each B–object has a G–
universal arrow, carried by a B–identity, but which has no coadjoint, not
even a right inverse.
How can these disasters be prevented? Only by the Axiom of Choice:
Theorem 4.51. 72 Equivalent are:
1. The Adjoint Functor Theorem holds.
2. The Special Adjoint Functor Theorem holds.
3. Every functor G: A →B, such that each B–object has a G–universal

To show that each of the conditions (1), (2), and (3) imply (4), consider
a family (Xi)i∈I of non–empty sets, indexed by some class I. Construct a

A and B are the categories naturally associated with the preordered classes

B = I ⊎{0, 1} is obtained from the discretely ordered class I by adding a
ﬁrst element 0 and a last element 1,

4.6 Disasters in Elementary Analysis: The Reals
and Continuity
Elementary analysis in ZF suﬀers from various defects. Before we analyze
these, let us ﬁrst point out several basic properties of the reals and of real
functions in ZFC that remain valid in the ZF–setting:
Theorem 4.52.
1. R and all its subspaces are metrizable, hence normal.
2. R and all its subspaces are second countable, i.e., have at most countable
bases.
3. R is separable, i.e., R has an at most countable, dense subset.
4. A subspace of R is connected iﬀit is an interval, i.e., contains with any
elements x and y each element between x and y.
5. A subspace of R is compact iﬀit is bounded and closed in R.
6. For each bounded, inﬁnite subset of R there exists an accumulation point
in R.
7. R is σ–compact, i.e., a countable union of compact subspaces.
8. A function f : R →R is continuous iﬀit is sequentially continuous.
9. A function f : [0, 1] →R is continuous iﬀit is uniformly continuous.
Proof. In most cases the ZFC–proof carries over to the ZF–setting. However,
see Proposition 3.30 for (5), Theorem 3.15 for (8), and Proposition 3.14 for
(9).
Unfortunately, however, the close and useful ties that exist in ZFC be-
tween static (ϵ–δ–deﬁnitions) and dynamic (use of sequences) aspects break

apart in the ZF–setting, where the construction of sequences — resp. more
generally: of countable sets — with speciﬁed properties in most cases relies
heavily on the condition CC(R). In fact, CC(R) turns out to be equivalent
to a surprising number of familiar statements in elementary analysis.
Disaster 4.53. 74 The following can happen:
1. R may fail to be Fr´echet, i.e., not every accumulation point x of a subset
A may be reachable75 by a sequence (an) in A.
2. R may fail to be sequential, i.e., there may be non–closed, sequentially
closed76 subsets of R.
3. R may fail to be Lindel¨of.
4. All Lindel¨of spaces of R may be compact.
5. Subspaces of R may fail to be separable.
6. Complete subspaces of R may fail to be closed in R.
7. Sequentially compact subspaces of R may fail to be bounded or to be
closed in R.
8. 77 Functions f : R →R may be sequentially continuous at some point x,
but fail to be continuous at x.
9. 78 Functions f : X →R, deﬁned on some subspace X of R, may be se-
quentially continuous, but fail to be continuous.
10. Inﬁnite subsets of R may be D–ﬁnite.
Proof. First, consider a model79 of ZF with an inﬁnite D–ﬁnite subset X of
R. Assume, without loss of generality, that X is bounded. By Theorem 4.52(6)
there exists an accumulation point a of X in R. Assume further, without loss
of generality, that a is not contained in X. Then X is sequentially closed,
but not closed in R. Thus (1) and (2) may occur. Furthermore, the subspace
X of R is complete and sequentially compact, but fails to be separable or to
be closed in R. Thus (5), (6), and (7) may occur. The function f : R →R,
deﬁned by f(x) =
1, if x ∈X
0, otherwise , is sequentially continuous at a but fails to
be continuous at a. Its restriction to A = X ∪{a} is sequentially continuous,
but not continuous. Thus (8) and (9) may occur.
That (3) may occur, follows from Theorem 3.8, since with R also its closed
subspace N would be Lindel¨of. Finally, the possible occurrence of (4) will be
shown in Section 7.1. (See Theorem 7.2.)

(2) ⇒(9) If f : X →R is sequentially continuous then the f–preimage
of each closed set in R is sequentially closed in X, thus, by (2), closed in X.
Consequently f is continuous. The inverse implication holds trivially in ZF.
(9) ⇒(10) By Theorem 3.8 it suﬃces to show that under (9) every un-
bounded subset A of R contains an unbounded sequence. Let h: R →(0, 1) be

h[A]. Deﬁne X = h[A] ∪{0} and f : X →R by f(x) =

. Then
f is not continuous, thus, by (9), not sequentially continuous. Thus there ex-
ists a sequence (bn) in h[A] that converges to 0. Consequently (h−1(bn)) is an
unbounded sequence in A.

(6) ⇒(1) Let a be an accumulation point of some subset X of R. X, being

(6) ⇒(1) Let X be sequentially closed in R. Assume that there exists
an accumulation point of X in R with a ̸∈X. Without loss of generality
we may assume that X ⊆(0, 1) and a = 1. Let h: (0, 1) →R be an order–
preserving homeomorphism with |x −y| ≤|h(x) −h(y)| for each pair (x, y) in
(0, 1)2. Then h[X] is complete and unbounded. Thus, by (6), there exists an
unbounded sequence (yn) in h[X]. Without loss of generality we may assume
that (yn) is monotone increasing. Thus the sequence (h−1(yn)) converges to
1, contradicting the stipulation that X is sequentially closed in R.

(3) ⇒(2) Let X be a complete subspace of R. Then, for each n ∈N, the
space X ∩[−n, n] is complete and bounded, thus by (3) compact, thus closed
in R. Consequently, X is closed in R.

contains an unbounded sequence, and consequently a sequence without con-
vergent subsequence. This contradicts the stipulation that X is sequentially
compact.
(4) ⇒(3) Immediate since each complete and bounded subspace of R is
sequentially compact.
If R is Fr´echet, then R is sequential. Does the converse implication hold?
The answer is no, as we will see below.
Deﬁnition 4.56. 82 ω–CC(R) states that for every sequence (Xn)n∈N of non–
empty subsets of R, there exists a sequence (Cn)n∈N of non–empty, at most
countable subsets Cn of Xn.
Proposition 4.57. 83 Each of the following statements implies the succeeding
ones:
1. R is the countable union of countable sets.
2. ω–CC(R).
3. R is sequential.
4. Fin(R).
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let (Xn)n∈N be a sequence of non–empty subsets of R and
let R be the union of the sequence (Am)m∈N of countable sets Am. For each
n ∈N, deﬁne
m(n) = min{m ∈N | (Xn ∩Am ̸= ∅}
Then, for each n ∈N, Cn = Xn ∩Am(n) is a non–empty at most countable
subset of Xn.
(2) ⇒(3) Let a be an accumulation point of some sequentially closed
subset X of R. Then, for each n ∈N, the set
Xn = X ∩[a −
1
n + 1, a +
1
n + 1]
is non–empty. Thus, by (2), there exists a sequence (Cn)n∈N of non–empty,
at most countable subsets Cn of Xn. Since X is sequentially closed, each
xn = inf Cn belongs to X, and thus a, the limit of (xn), belongs to X as well.
Consequently X is closed in R.
(3) ⇒(4) Immediate, since all inﬁnite, D–ﬁnite subsets of R are sequen-
tially closed but not closed in R.
Thus we get the following diagram:

4.7 Disasters in Topology I: Countable Sums
Our result vividly demonstrates the hor-
rors of topology without AC.
E.K. van Douwen92
Even the most innocent of topological ques-
tions may be undecidable from the Zermelo–
Fraenkel axioms alone.
Good, Tree, and Watson93
The formation of countable sums is one of the simplest constructions in
topology. In ZFC it preserves most of the familiar properties of topological
spaces, in particular:
1. metrizability,
2. normality,
3. separability,
4. second countability,
5. the Lindel¨of property,
6. dimension zero.
However in ZF — though countable sums of metric spaces are still metrizable
(see Exercise E 1) — none of the above 6 properties is necessarily preserved
under the formation of countable sums. Let us stress in particular that those
mathematicians, who have the dangerous habit of not distinguishing between
the notions of metric space and metrizable space, live in an inconsistent world,
where countable sums of such spaces are metrizable (Exercise E 1) and at the
same time are not necessarily metrizable (Disaster 4.60).
E.K. van Douwen [vDou85] has constructed a model94 of ZF which fails
to have the following property:
CC(Z): For each sequence ((Xn, ≤n))n∈N of ordered sets, each of which is
order–isomorphic to the set Z of integers with its natural order,
we have 
n
Xn ̸= ∅.
Disaster 4.60. 95 If CC(Z) fails there exists a sequence of separable, metriz-
able, compact spaces (Yn) with dim Yn = 0, such that 

Yn is neither

metrizable, nor normal, nor separable, nor second countable, nor Lindel¨of,
nor with dimension 0.
Proof. Let (Xn) be a sequence of ordered sets, each order isomorphic to the
integers with their natural order, such that  Xn = ∅. For each n, obtain a
set Yn by adding to Xn a ﬁrst element an and a last element bn, and supply Yn
with the corresponding order–topology. Then the Yn are all order–isomorphic
and thus homeomorphic to the subspace of R determined by the set
S = {0} ∪
 1
n | n ∈N+

∪

2 −1
n | n ∈N+

∪{2}.
Thus each Yn is a separable, metrizable, compact space with dimension 0,
hence also normal, second countable, and Lindel¨of.
Next, consider the sum Y = 
n
Yn of the Yn’s. Assume, for simplicity that
the Yn’s are pairwise disjoint so that the underlying set of Y is just the union
of the Yn’s.
Claim
1:
Y
is not normal, hence is neither metrizable nor of
dimension 0.
Proof of Claim 1:
The sets A = {an | n ∈N} and B = {bn | n ∈N} are
disjoint closed subsets of Y . If U and V would be disjoint neighborhoods of
A and B in Y , then, for each n ∈N, the set U ∩Xn would be a non–empty,
upper–bounded subset of Xn, and would thus contain a largest element xn.
Hence (xn) would be an element of 
n
Xn, contrary to the assumption.
Claim 2:
Y is neither separable nor second countable.
Proof of Claim 2:
Since every dense subset of Y contains every x in 
n
Xn,
and since every base of Y contains each set {x} with x ∈
n
Xn, separability
resp. second countability of Y would imply that 
n
Xn is countable which in
turn would imply 
n
Xn ̸= ∅.
Claim 3:
Y is not Lindel¨of.
Proof of Claim 3:
Consider the open cover
U = {Yn \ {x} | n ∈N, x ∈Xn}
of Y . If U would have a countable subcover
V = {Yn(m) \ {xm} | m ∈N},
then, for each n ∈N, there would exist a smallest m = m(n) with n(m) = n.
Thus (xm(n))n∈N would be an element of 
n
Xn, contrary to the assumption.

4.7 Disasters in Topology I: Countable Sums
81
Observe that the spaces Yn, entering in the above construction, are pair-
wise isomorphic, but not identical. What happens if we form the sum of count-
ably many copies of a ﬁxed space Z, equivalently: the product of Z with a
countable discrete space N? It is easy to see that metrizability, separability,
and second countability are being preserved under this construction. But the
remaining 3 of the above 6 properties may still fail to hold:
Disaster 4.61. If CC(Z) fails there exists a compact Hausdorﬀspace Z with
dim Z = 0 such that Z ×N, the sum of countably many copies of Z, is neither
normal, nor Lindel¨of nor has dimension 0.
Proof. Consider the space Y , constructed in the proof of Disaster 4.60. Being
locally compact, Y has a 1–point Hausdorﬀcompactiﬁcation Z = Y ∪{∞}.
Obviously dim Z = 0. Consider the ﬁrst projection πZ : Z × N →Z. If Z × N
would be normal, then the disjoint closed sets A∗= {(an, n) | n ∈N} and
B∗= {(bn, n) | n ∈N} would have disjoint neighborhoods U ∗and V ∗in Z×N.
Consequently the sets U = 
n
πZ[(Yn ×{n})∩U ∗] and V = 
n
πZ[(Yn ×{n})∩
V ∗] would be disjoint neighborhoods of A = {an | n ∈N} and B = {bn |
n ∈N} in Y , which — according to Claim 1 in the proof of Disaster 4.60 —
cannot happen. Thus Z × N fails to be normal, hence also to have dimension
0. Moreover, Z × N fails to be Lindel¨of since the open cover
{(Z\Yn) × {n} | n ∈N} ∪{(Yn\{x}) × {n} | n ∈N and x ∈Xn}
has no countable subcover.
In Theorem 3.8 we have shown that the sum of countably many copies of
a one–point space, i.e., a countable discrete space, is Lindel¨of if and only if
CC(R) holds. Thus the Lindel¨of property can get destroyed by this process.
The following result describes the general situation:
Theorem 4.62. 96 Equivalent are:
1. Countable sums of Lindel¨of spaces are Lindel¨of.
2. The sum of countably many copies of a compact Hausdorﬀspace is Lin-
del¨of.
3. The sum of a compact Hausdorﬀspace with a countable discrete space is
Lindel¨of.
4. CC.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) is obvious.
(2) ⇒(3) Let X be a compact Hausdorﬀspace and let N be a countable
discrete space. Then the sum X + N is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of

[Bru82], [Her2002], [Ker200?].

the sum of countably many copies of the compact Hausdorﬀspace X + {0},
the sum of X with a one–point space. Thus (3) follows from (2).
(3) ⇒(4) Let (Xn) be a sequence of non–empty sets. Let X = 
n
Xn∪{∞}
be the one–point compactiﬁcation of the discrete space 
n
Xn, and let N be
the discrete space of natural numbers. By (3), the sum X + N is Lindel¨of.
Thus the open cover
U = {X} ∪{{n, x} | n ∈N and x ∈Xn}
contains a countable subcover {Un | n ∈N}.
For each n ∈N deﬁne
n∗= min{m ∈N | n ∈Um}.
Then Un∗= {n, xn} for a unique element xn of Xn. Thus (xn) ∈
n
Xn.
(4) ⇒(1) Let X = 
n
Xn be a countable sum of (pairwise disjoint) Lindel¨of
spaces, and let U be an open cover of X. For each n, Vn = {U ∩Xn | U ∈U}
is an open cover of Xn, thus it contains a countable subcover {Vm | m ∈N} of
Xn. For each m ∈N the set Um = {U ∈U | U ∩Xn = Vm} is not empty. So,
by CC, there exists a sequence (Um)m∈N in U with Um∩Xn = Vm, hence with
Xn ⊆
m
Um. Using CC again, we obtain a sequence (Un) of countable subsets
of U with Xn ⊆ Un. Using CC a third time, we conclude that V = 
n
Un is
a countable subset of U that covers X = 
n
Xn.
Remark 4.63. Observe, that by the above result, even the sum of two Lin-
del¨of spaces may fail to be Lindel¨of. In fact, if CC(R) holds, but CC fails97,
then there exists a compact Hausdorﬀspace (even a one–point compactiﬁ-
cation of a discrete space) whose sum with the discrete Lindel¨of space N of
natural numbers fails to be Lindel¨of.
Theorem 4.64. 98 Equivalent are:
1. Countable sums of separable spaces are separable.
2. CC.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let (Xn) be a sequence of non–empty sets. Assume w.l.o.g.
that the Xn’s are pairwise disjoint. Consider each Xn as an indiscrete, hence
separable, topological space. By (1), there exists a sequence (dn) in 
n∈N
Xn
such that {dn | n ∈N} is dense in 
n∈N
Xn. Deﬁne
xn = dmin{m∈N|dm∈Xn}.

Then (xn) ∈
n∈N
Xn.
(2) ⇒(1) Let (Xn) be a sequence of (non-empty and pairwise disjoint)
separable spaces. Then, for each n ∈N, the set Dn of all maps f : N →Xn
such that f[N] is dense in Xn, is non–empty. By (2), there exists some (fn) ∈

n∈N
Dn. Thus 
n∈N
fn[N] is a countable, dense subset of 
n∈N
Xn.
For a corresponding result about countable sums of normal spaces we need
the following lemma whose interesting combinatorial proof is too long to be
included here:
Lemma 4.65. 99 Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of inﬁnite sets. Let P0
ﬁnXi be the
set of all non–empty, ﬁnite subsets of Xi, and let Mi be the set consisting of
all pairs (A, B) in (P0
ﬁnXi)2 with A ̸= ∅̸= B and A ∩B = ∅for each A ∈A
and B ∈B. Then there exists a family (fi)i∈I of functions fi : Mi →P0
ﬁnXi.
Theorem 4.66. 100 Equivalent are
1. Countable sums of normal spaces are normal.
2. CMC.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let (Xn)n∈N be a sequence of non–empty sets. To estab-
lish CMC we may assume w.l.o.g. that all the Xn’s are inﬁnite. For each n
construct a normal topological space (Yn, τn) as follows:
Yn the disjoint union of P0
ﬁnXn and a 2–element set {an, bn}.
τn consists of all subsets A of Yn which satisfy the following two properties:
1. If an ∈A, then there exists some F ∈P0
ﬁnXn such that
F ↑= {G ∈P0
ﬁnXn | F ⊆G} ⊆A.
2. If bn ∈A, then there exists some F ∈P0
ﬁnXn such that
F ∗= {G ∈P0
ﬁnXn | G ∩F = ∅} ⊆A.
Assume w.l.o.g. that the Yn’s are pairwise disjoint and form the sum Y =

n∈N
Yn. By (1), Y is normal. Thus the disjoint closed sets A = {an | n ∈N}
and B = {bn | n ∈N} have disjoint open neighborhoods U and V .
Deﬁne An = {F ∈P0
ﬁnXn | F ↑⊆U} and
Bn = {F ∈P0
ﬁnXn | F ∗⊆V }.
Then the An’s and Bn’s are non–empty and satisfy F ∩G ̸= ∅for each
F ∈An and G ∈Bn. Thus, for each n ∈N, the pair (An, Bn) belongs
to Mn, as deﬁned in Lemma 4.65. Let (fn)n∈N be a sequence of functions
fn : Mn →P0
ﬁnXn. Then, for each n, Fn = fn(An, Bn) is a non–empty, ﬁnite
subset of Xn. This establishes CMC.
(2) ⇒(1) Let X = 
n∈N
Xn be a countable sum of (pairwise disjoint)
normal spaces and let A and B be disjoint closed subsets of X. Then, for each

n ∈N, the sets An = A ∩Xn and Bn = B ∩Xn are disjoint closed subsets
of Xn. Thus, by normality of the Xn’s, for each n ∈N the set Pn, consisting
of all pairs (U, V ) of disjoint open neighborhoods of An and Bn in Xn, is not
empty. Denote the ﬁrst and second projection of fn by π1
n resp. π2
n. By CMC
there exists a sequence (fn)n∈N of non–empty, ﬁnite subsets Fn of Pn. Thus,
for each n ∈N, the sets Un =  π1
n[fn] and Vn =  π2
n[fn] are disjoint open
neighborhoods of An and Bn in Xn. Consequently U = 
n∈N
Un and V = 
n∈N

are disjoint open neighborhoods of A and B in X. Thus X is normal.

Remark 4.73. The implication (1) ⇒(2) of Proposition 4.72 is a proper
one, since there exists a ZF–model114 in which PIT and CC, and thus con-
dition (2) hold (see Exercise E 4), but DC fails. It is not known whether the
implication (2) ⇒(3) is also proper.
What happens, if we restrict things further by considering only countable
products of ﬁnite (discrete) spaces?
Disaster 4.74. Countable products of ﬁnite spaces may fail to be compact.
Theorem 4.75. 115 Equivalent are:
1. Countable products of ﬁnite spaces are compact.
2. Countable products of ﬁnite discrete spaces are compact.
3. CC(ﬁn).
Proof. (1) ⇔(2) Straightforward.
(2) ⇒(3) Analogous to the proof of the corresponding implication in
Theorem 4.68.
(3) ⇒(2) Let P = 
n∈N
Xn be the product of a sequence (Xn)n∈N of ﬁnite
discrete spaces, and let F be a ﬁlter on P. Then (3) implies, via Proposition
3.5, that 
n∈N
Xn is at most countable, thus well–orderable. Now proceed as
in the proof of Theorem 3.13, by choosing x0 and each xn+1 as the smallest
point with the desired properties.
Let us go even further and restrict attention, for a given natural number
n, to countable products of spaces with n points each. Then for n ∈{0, 1}
we are on safe and trivial ground, and even for n = 2 we remain safe: see
Theorem 3.17. Moreover, Theorem 3.13 immediately implies, that for each
n ∈N the space nN is compact (where n is the discrete space with underlying
set {0, 1, . . . , n −1}116. However:

Theorem 4.68.
(2) ⇒(1) Let P = 
m∈N
Xm be the product of a sequence of spaces Xm
with at most n + 1 points each.
Case 1: P = ∅. Then P is compact.
Case 2: P ̸= ∅. Let (xm)m∈N be an element of P. Then, for each m ∈N,
the set Ym = Xm \ {xm} contains at most n elements. Thus, by (3), the set
Y = 
m∈N
Ym is at most countable. Consequently, 
m∈N
Xm = Y ∪{xm | m ∈N}
is at most countable, thus well–orderable. Now proceed as in the proof of
Theorem 3.13 resp. Theorem 4.75.
Remark 4.78. Observe that CC(2) may fail in ZF118.
Conclusion: In ZF the TychonoﬀTheorem breaks down completely. How-
ever, there is still hope: As we have seen in Section 3.2, the compactness con-
cept splits in ZF in various, no longer equivalent, variants. Do some of these
variants behave any better?
Disaster 4.79. Products of ultraﬁlter–compact spaces may fail to be ultra-
ﬁlter–compact.
In fact, the TychonoﬀTheorem for ultraﬁlter–compact spaces holds if and
only if either AC holds or AC fails badly. In between these extremes it fails:
Theorem 4.80. 119 Equivalent are:
1. Products of ultraﬁlter–compact spaces are ultraﬁlter–compact.
2. Either AC holds or WUF(?) fails, i.e., there are no free ultraﬁlters120.
Let us postpone the proof of Theorem 4.80 until after Remark 4.83 and
ﬁrst consider the Hausdorﬀcase. Here the sky brightens:
4.81. TychonoﬀTheorem for ultraﬁlter–compact Hausdorﬀspaces:
Products of ultraﬁlter compact Hausdorﬀspaces are ultraﬁlter–compact.
Proof. Let P = 
i∈I
Xi be the product of a family of ultraﬁlter–compact Haus-
dorﬀspaces, and let U be an ultraﬁlter on P. Then, for each i ∈I, the set
{A ⊆Xi | π−1
i
[A] ∈U} is an ultraﬁlter on Xi, and thus converges to a unique
point xi in Xi. Consequently U converges to the point (xi)i∈I in P.

Model (N2(2) in [HoRu98]).
119 [Her96]
120 WUF(?) fails, e.g., in the Feferman–Blass Model (M15 in [HoRu98]) and in
Pincus–Solovay’s Model A6 (M27 in [HoRu98]). See also [Blass77].

4.82. ˇCech–Stone Theorem for ultraﬁlter–compact Hausdorﬀspaces:
121 The ultraﬁlter–compact Hausdorﬀspaces form an epireﬂective subcategory
of the category Haus of Hausdorﬀspaces and continuous maps.
Proof. Immediate from the fact that a full subcategory A of Haus is epire-
ﬂective in Haus if (and only if) A is closed under the formation of products
and closed subspaces. For details see, e.g., [Her68] or [AHS2004].
Remark 4.83. Even though the ˇCech–Stone Theorem holds for ultraﬁlter–
compact Hausdorﬀspaces, the situation is not quite as satisfactory as in the
ZFC–setting. In the latter there exist many detailed descriptions122 of the
ˇCech–Stone compactiﬁcation βX (= the compact Hausdorﬀreﬂection) of X,
at least for completely regular spaces, whereas in the ZF setting no detailed
description of the ultraﬁlter–compact Hausdorﬀreﬂection is known — an
exception being the discrete case. If X is a discrete space, then its Wallman
extension ωX is an ultraﬁlter–compact Hausdorﬀreﬂection of X. Here follows
a simple description of ωX: For each free ultraﬁlter U on X, add to X a point
pU. Thus the underlying set of ωX has the form X ∪{pU | U is a free ultraﬁlter
on X}.
For each subset A of X, deﬁne
A∗= A ∪{pU | A ∈U}.
Then {A∗| A ⊆X} is a base for the topology of ωX.
Now we are ready to present a
Proof of Theorem 4.80: (1) ⇒(2) Assume that there exists a free ultraﬁlter U
on some set X. To show that AC holds, let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty
sets. Let ωX be the Wallman extension of the discrete space with underlying
set X. Assume for simplicity that the underlying set of ωX is disjoint from
each Xi. For each i ∈I, consider space Yi; obtained from ωX via replacement
of the point pU by the set Xi, considered as an indiscrete subspace of Yi. Then
each Yi is ultraﬁlter–compact and the ultraﬁlter Ui, generated by U, has Xi
as its set of limit points. By (1), the product space Y = 
i∈I
Yi is ultraﬁlter
compact. Let ∆: X →Y be the diagonal embedding. Then in Y the ﬁlter
V, generated by ∆[U], is an ultraﬁlter, and thus converges to some point y.
Consequently, for each i ∈I, the ﬁlter Ui = {A ⊆Xi | π−1
i
[A] ∈V} converges
in Yi to πi(y). This implies πi(y) ∈Xi, thus y ∈
i∈I
Xi. So AC holds.
(2) ⇒(1) If AC holds, then (1) follows as in the proof of Theorem 4.81.
If WUF(?) fails, then every space is ultraﬁlter–compact, and thus (1) holds
trivially.
Next, let us turn our attention to Tychonoﬀ–compactness. As we will see,
here the situation concerning the TychonoﬀTheorem and the ˇCech–Stone

Theorem (and also the theory of rings of continuous functions) is as pleasant
as in the ZFC–setting123.
4.84. TychonoﬀTheorem for Tychonoﬀ–compact spaces:124
Products of Tychonoﬀ–compact spaces are Tychonoﬀ–compact.
Proof. Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of Tychonoﬀ–compact spaces. Then, for each
i ∈I, the canonical map
ji : Xi →[0, 1]C(Xi,[0,1]),
deﬁned by πf ◦ji = f for each f ∈C(Xi, [0, 1]), is a closed embedding (see
Exercises to Section 3.3, E 4). Consequently, the product map

i∈I
ji :

i∈I
Xi −→

i∈I
[0, 1]C(Xi,[0,1]) ∼= [0, 1]
 C(Xi,[0,1])
is a closed embedding, too, and thus 
i∈I
Xi is Tychonoﬀ–compact.
Observe that the above theorem could have been included into Section 3.2,
since among all the closed embeddings of a Tychnonoﬀ–compact space into
powers [0, 1]I of [0, 1] there exists (according to Exercises to Section 3.3, E 4)
a distinguished one.
4.85. ˇCech–Stone Theorem for Tychonoﬀ–compact spaces125
Tychonoﬀ–compact spaces form an epireﬂective subcategory of the category
Tych of completely regular spaces and continuous maps. In particular, every
completely regular space X can be densely embedded into a Tychonoﬀ–
compact space βX (its ˇCech–Stone compactiﬁcation) such that the following
equivalent properties are satisﬁed:
1. Every continuous map X →[0, 1] can be extended to a continuous map
βX →[0, 1].
2. Every bounded, continuous map X →R can be extended to a continuous
map βX →R.
3. Every continuous map X →C from X into some Tychonoﬀ–compact
space C can be extended to a continuous map βX →C.
Proof. Let X be a completely regular space. Then the canonical map
j : X →[0, 1]C(X,[0,1])
is an embedding. Factor j through the closure βX = cl[j[X]] of its image j[X]
in [0, 1]
X
j→[0, 1]C(X,[0,1]) = X
β→βX →[0, 1]C(X,[0,1]).
Then the dense embedding β : X →βX has the desired properties126.

Remark 4.86. Alternative constructions of the Tychonoﬀ–compact reﬂection
X →βX can be found in [Com68] (via rings of continuous functions), in
[Cha72] and in [Sal74] (via zero ultraﬁlters and the Wallman construction).
Theorem 4.87. 127 The Tychonoﬀ–compact spaces form the epireﬂective
hull128 of the completely regular compact spaces in the category Tych.
Proof. Let A, resp. B, be the class of all completely regular compact, resp. all
Tychonoﬀ–compact, spaces and let C be the epireﬂective hull of A in Tych.
For each X in A the canonical map
j : X →[0, 1]C(X,[0,1])
is a closed embedding. (Complete regularity implies that j is an embedding,
compactness implies that j[X] is closed in [0, 1]C(X,[0,1]), see Exercises to Sec-
tion 3.3, E 2). Thus A ⊆B and thus C ⊆B. Since [0, 1] belongs to A, all
closed subspaces of powers of [0, 1], i.e., all elements of B, belong to C. Thus
B ⊆C. Consequently B = C.
Finally, let us turn our attention to Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact spaces.
Here the TychonoﬀTheorem breaks down completely.
Disaster 4.88. Even ﬁnite products of Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact spaces
may fail to be Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact.
Theorem 4.89. 129 Equivalent are:
1. Products of Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact spaces are Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–
compact.
2. Finite products of Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact spaces are Alexandroﬀ–
Urysohn–compact.
3. Cantor cubes 2I are Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn compact.
4. AC.
Proof. Obviously (1) implies (2) and (3).
(2) ⇒(4) By Theorem 4.20 it suﬃces to show that any two cardinals are
comparable w.r.t. ≤. Let A and B be inﬁnite sets with cardinals |A| = a and
|B| = b. Then the indiscrete space X with underlying set A ∪B, and the
discrete space 2 (with underlying set {0, 1}) are both Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–
compact, and thus — by (2) — so is their product X × 2. Thus the set
C = (A×{0})∪(B ×{1}) has a complete accumulation point (x, y) in X ×2.
If y = 0, then (A ∪B) × {0} is a neighborhood of (x, y) that meets C in

128 The epireﬂective hull of A in B is the smallest epireﬂective subcategory of B
that contains A (provided that such an entity exists).

A × {0}. Thus a = |A| = |A × {0}| = |C| = |A ∪B| = a + b, and hence b ≤a.
Likewise y = 1 implies a ≤b. Consequently a and b are comparable.
(3) ⇒(4) As above, consider arbitrary inﬁnite sets A and B and let ∞
be not contained in A ∪B. Form I = {∞} ∪A ∪B and consider the Cantor
cube 2I. For a subset C of I, let χC : I →2 be the associated characteristic
function, deﬁned by χC(i) =
1, if i ∈C
0, if i ̸∈C .
By (3) the
{χ{a} | a ∈A} ∪{χ{∞,b} | b ∈B}
has a complete accumulation point in 2I. As above, this implies that the
cardinal numbers of A and B are comparable with respect to ≤.
(4) ⇒(1) is well–known.

4.9 Disasters in Topology III: Function Spaces
(The Ascoli Theorem)
Mathematics is the art of deduction
rather than a list of facts.
V.W. Marek and J. Mycielski135
The TychonoﬀTheorem provides the foundation for several important
results in topology and in functional analysis. One of these is the ˇCech–Stone
Theorem, which has been treated in the previous section. Another one is
the Ascoli Theorem, which will be analyzed in this section. It concerns the
characterization of compactness among certain spaces of continuous functions.
Unfortunately — even in ZFC — the category Top of topological spaces
and continuous maps as well as all its topological subcategories that are closed
under the formation of squares and contain the Sierpi´nski–space136, fail to be
cartesian closed137, i.e., none of these categories has function spaces which
have all the categorically desirable properties. However, the set C(X, Y ) of all
continuous functions from X to Y carries several canonical topologies. The
weak topology, i.e., the one induced by the product topology on the space Y X,
is for many applications too coarse. A ﬁner and more useful topology, coming
close to satisfying the categorically desirable properties, is the compact–open
topology τco which has as canonical subbase the set of all sets of the form
[K, U] = {f ∈C(X, Y ) | f[K] ⊆U},
where K is compact in X and U is open in Y . The space Cco(X, Y ) =
(C(X, Y ), τco) coincides, for discrete spaces X, with the product space Y X.
The Ascoli Theorem takes on various forms. For our purpose the following
version seems appropriate.
Deﬁnition 4.90. The Ascoli Theorem states that for every locally compact
Hausdorﬀspace X, for every metric space Y , and for every subspace F of
Cco(X, Y ), the following conditions are equivalent:
(a) F is compact.
(b) (α) For each x ∈X the set F(x) = {f(x) | f ∈F} is compact in Y .
(β) F is closed in the product space Y X.
(γ) F is equicontinuous, i.e.
∀x ∈X ∀ϵ > 0 ∃U ∈U(x) ∀f ∈F
∀y ∈U
d(f(x), f(y)) < ϵ,
135 [MaMy2001]
136 The Sierpi´nski space is the space with underlying set 2 = {0, 1} and open sets
∅, {0}, and 2.
137 See, e.g., [Her83].

where U(x) is the neighborhood–ﬁlter of x in X and d is the distance–
function of Y .
Theorem 4.91. 138 Equivalent are:
1. The Ascoli Theorem.
2. PIT.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let X be a set and let 2 be the discrete space with under-
lying set {0, 1}. Consider X as a discrete space and 2 as a metric space with
distance–function d determined by d(0, 1) = 1. Let F be C(X, 2) = 2X. Then
condition (b) of the Ascoli Theorem is satisﬁed. Thus (1) implies that 2X is
compact. Hence, by Theorem 4.70, PIT holds.
(2) ⇒(1) Let X, Y , and F be as speciﬁed in the Ascoli Theorem.
(a) →(b, α) Since F is compact in Cco(X, Y ), it is compact in Y X.
Thus, for each x ∈X, its image πx[F] = F(x) under the projection map
πx : Y X →Y is compact.
(a) →(b, β) Again, F is compact in the Hausdorﬀspace Y X, and thus
(by Exercises to Section 3.3, E 2) closed in Y X.
(a) →(b, γ) Choose x ∈X and ϵ > 0. Then, for each f ∈F, the set
Bf = {y ∈Y | d(f(x), y) < ϵ
2} is open in Y . Thus, by continuity of f and
local compactness of X, there exists a compact neighborhood Kf of x with
f[Kf] ⊆Bf. Thus
Uf = F ∩[Kf, Bf] = {g ∈F | g[Kf] ⊆Bf}
is an open neighborhood of f in F. Consider the evaluation map ω: X ×F →
Y , deﬁned by ω(y, g) = g(y). Then the above implies ω[Kf × Uf] ⊆Bf.
Consider the collection C of all triples (f, K, U) with f ∈F, K a neighborhood
of x in X, and U an open neighborhood of f in F with ω[K ×U] ⊆Bf. Then,
by the above
U = {U ⊆F | ∃f ∈F
∃K ⊆X
(f, K, U) ∈C}
is an open cover of F. Thus, by (a), there exist ﬁnitely many members
U1, . . . , Un of U which cover F. For each i ∈{1, . . . , n}, select fi ∈F and
Ki ⊆X with (fi, Ki, Ui) ∈C. Then U =
n
i=1
Ki is a neighborhood of x in X.
Claim: ∀f ∈F
∀y ∈U
d(f(x), f(y)) < ϵ.
Proof. For f ∈F there exists some i ∈{1, . . . , n} with f ∈Ui. Thus y ∈U
implies:
f(y) = ω(y, f) ⊆ω[U × Ui] ⊆ω[Ki × Ui] ⊆Bfi,
i.e., d(fi(x), f(y)) < ϵ
2. In particular, x ∈U implies d(fi(x), f(x)) < ϵ
2. Thus
138 [Her97]

4.9 Disasters in Topology III: Function Spaces (The Ascoli Theorem)
97
d(f(x), f(y)) ≤d(f(x), fi(x)) + d(fi(x), f(y)) < ϵ.
Consequently F is equicontinuous.
(b) →(a) By (b, α), each F(x) is a compact Hausdorﬀspace. Thus, by
condition (2) and Theorem 4.70, 
x∈X
F(x) is compact. By (b, β), F is closed
in Y X and thus in 
x∈X
F(x). Consequently F is compact with respect to the
weak topology τ, i.e., when considered as a subspace of Y X. So it remains to
be shown that (b, γ) implies that τ equals the (generally ﬁner) compact–open
topology σ on F. For this purpose consider an element V = [K, U] ∩F of the
canonical subbase of σ, and let f be an element of V . It remains to be shown
that V is a neighborhood of f in the weak topology. Since f[K] ⊆U and U
is open in Y , we obtain for each x ∈K
rx = inf{d(f(x), y) | y ∈(Y \ U)} > 0.
Then Ux = {z ∈X | d(f(x), f(z)) < rx
2 } is an open neighborhood of x in X,
and U = {Ux | x ∈K} is an open cover of K. By compactness of K there
exist ﬁnitely many members x1, . . . , xn of K such that K ⊆
n
i=1
Uxi. Thus
r = min{rx1, . . . , rxn} > 0, and for each x ∈K and each y ∈(Y \ U) the
inequality d(f(x), y) ≥r
2 follows; in other words:
x ∈K and d(f(x), y) <
r
2 imply y ∈U. By equicontinuity of F there
exists, for each x ∈X, some neighborhood W of x in X such that:
(*)
∀g ∈F
∀z ∈W
d(g(x), g(z)) < r
4.
Consider the set C of all pairs (x, W) with x ∈X and W an open neigh-
borhood of x in X such that (*) holds. Then
U = {W ⊆X | ∃x ∈K (x, W) ∈C}
is an open cover of K. By compactness of K there exist ﬁnitely many members
W1, . . . , Wm in U which cover K. For each i ∈{1, . . . , m} select some xi with
(xi, Wi) ∈C. Then
B = {g ∈F | d(f(xi), g(xi)) < r
4 for i = 1, . . . , n}
is a neighborhood of f in the weak topology τ.
Claim: B ⊆V .
Proof. Consider g ∈B. For each x ∈K there exists some i ∈{1, . . . , m} with
x ∈Wi. This implies d(g(xi), g(x)) < r
4 by (*). Since g ∈B, the inequality
d(f(xi), g(xi)) < r
4 holds. Thus:

98
4 Disasters without Choice
d(f(xi), g(x)) ≤d(f(xi), g(xi)) + d(g(xi), g(x)) < r
2.
Consequently, g(x) ∈U; hence g[K] ⊆U; hence g ∈V .
This completes the proof.
Observe that the implication (a) ⇒(b) of the Ascoli Theorem holds in
ZF, and that for the reverse implication (b) ⇒(a) the only non–ZF require-
ment is that products of compact Hausdorﬀspaces are compact. Since prod-
ucts of ultraﬁlter–compact Hausdorﬀspace are always ultraﬁlter–compact,
we may conjecture that the Ascoli Theorem holds, if we replace the notion
of compactness, wherever it occurs (hence particularly in the deﬁnition of the
compact–open topology), by that of ultraﬁlter–compactness. Alas:
Theorem 4.92. 139 Equivalent are:
1. The Ascoli Theorem w.r.t. ultraﬁlter–compactness.
2. PIT.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) By Theorem 4.70 it suﬃces to show that condition (1)
implies that all Cantor cubes 2I are compact. Assume that, for some set
I, the space P = 2I fails to be compact. Consider I as a discrete space
and 2 as a metric space with d(0, 1) = 1. Then there exists a ﬁlter F on P
without a cluster point. Thus the set X of all clopen140 members of F has
the ﬁnite–intersection–property, but empty intersection. For each A ∈X, the
map fA : P →2, deﬁned by fA(x) =

1, if x ∈A
0, if x ̸∈A , is continuous. Thus the
family (fA)A∈X induces a continuous map f : P →2X. Let F = f[P] be the
image of P under f. A simple computation shows that f is an embedding. So
F is homeomorphic to P and thus, by Theorem 4.81, F is ultraﬁlter–compact.
Apply the Ascoli Theorem w.r.t. ultraﬁlter–compactness to X, considered as
a discrete space, Y = 2, and F. Then condition (a) is satisﬁed. However
condition (b β) fails, since the point p = (1)A∈X of 2X whose coordinates are
all 1, belongs to the closure of F in 2X, since X has the ﬁnite–intersection–
property, but not to F, since X has empty intersection. Thus (1) fails, a
contradiction.
(2) ⇒(1) By Theorems 3.22 and 4.37, PIT implies that compact =
ultraﬁlter–compact. Thus (1) follows from Theorem 4.91.
Since for Tychonoﬀ–compact spaces the TychonoﬀTheorem and the ˇCech–
Stone Theorem hold, we may expect the Ascoli Theorem for Tychonoﬀ–
compact spaces to hold as well. Alas:

Theorem 4.93. 141 Equivalent are:
1. The Ascoli Theorem w.r.t. Tychonoﬀ–compactness.
2. PIT.
Proof. Since the proof of Theorem 4.93 parallels that of Theorem 4.92 it is
left as an exercise (see Exercise E 1).
In view of the above facts the following result is no longer surprising:
Theorem 4.94. 142 Equivalent are:
1. The Ascoli Theorem w.r.t. Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compactness.
2. AC.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) By Theorem 4.89 it suﬃces to show that all Cantor–cubes
2I are Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact. Let X be the discrete space with un-
derlying set I, Y be the space 2, considered as a metric space with d(0, 1) = 1,
and F = 2X. Then condition (b) of the Ascoli–Theorem w.r.t. Alexandroﬀ–
Urysohn–compactness is trivially satisﬁed. Thus, by condition (1), condition
(a) holds as well, i.e., 2I is Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compact.
(2) ⇒(1) Under AC, Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn–compactness agrees with com-
pactness. Thus (1) follows from Theorem 4.91.
Sadly enough our resum´e of the above results is this:
Disaster 4.95. The Ascoli Theorem may fail under each of the interpreta-
tions of compactness given above.
So there seems no hope left to salvage the Ascoli Theorem. Recall however
that the classical form of the Ascoli Theorem is more restricted than the one
formulated in 4.90. Can the former perhaps be saved?
Deﬁnition 4.96. The Classical Ascoli Theorem states that for any set F
of continuous maps f : R →R the following conditions are equivalent:
(a) Each sequence (fn) in F has a subsequence f(ν(n)) that converges con-
tinuously143 to some map g (not necessarily in F), i.e.,
141 [Her97a]
142 [Her97a]
143 Observe:
a) If (fn) converges continuously to g, then g is continuous.
b) If (fn) converges locally uniformly to g, then (fn) converges continuously
to g.
c) If (fn) converges continuously to g, then (fn) converges pointwise to g.

∀x ∈R
∀(xn) ∈RN ((xn) →x ⇒(fν(n)(xn)) →g(x)).
(b) (α) For each x ∈R the set F(x) = {f(x) | f ∈F} is bounded.
(β) F is equicontinuous.
Disaster strikes even here:
Theorem 4.97. 144 Equivalent are:
1. The Classical Ascoli Theorem.
2. CC(R).
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) By Theorem 3.8 it suﬃces to show that each unbounded
subset B of R contains an unbounded sequence. For this purpose, consider
for each b ∈B the constant map fb : R →R with value b. Then the set
F = {fb | b ∈B} violates condition (b, α) of the Classical Ascoli Theorem.
So, by (1) it violates condition (a) as well. Thus there exists a sequence (fbn)
in F that has no continuously convergent subsequence. This fact implies that
the sequence (bn) is unbounded.
(2) ⇒(1) Observe ﬁrst that every continuous map f : R →R is determined
by its restriction f|Q : Q →R to the rationals. This implies that there are only
|RQ| = (2ℵ0)ℵ0 = 2ℵ0·ℵ0 = 2ℵ0 = |R| continuous functions f : R →R. Hence
CC(R) implies that for every sequence (Fn) of non–empty sets of continuous
functions f : R →R there exists some choice–sequence (fn) ∈
n∈N
Fn.
With this fact in mind let us turn to the proof of the Classical Ascoli
Theorem: Let F be a set of continuous maps f : R →R.
(a) ⇒(b, α) Assume that (b, α) fails. Then there exists some x ∈R such
that F(x) is unbounded. Thus, for each n ∈N, the set Fn = {f ∈F | |f(x)| ≥
n} is not empty. Consequently there exists (fn) ∈
n∈N
Fn. Obviously (fn) has
no continuously convergent subsequence. This contradicts condition (a).
(a) ⇒(b, β) Assume that (b, β) fails. Then there exists some x ∈R and
some ϵ > 0 such that, for each n ∈N, the set
Fn = {f ∈F | ∃y ∈R |x −y| <
1
n + 1
and
|f(x) −f(y)| ≥ϵ}
is non–empty. Consequently there exists (fn) ∈
n∈N
Fn.
Obviously (fn) has no continuously convergent subsequence. This contra-
dicts condition (a).
(b) ⇒(a) Let (fn) be a sequence in F. Express the rationals as a sequence
(rn) and deﬁne, by induction, a sequence of pairs (an, sn) with an ∈R and
sn = (gn
m)m∈N a sequence in F as follows:
144 [Rhi2001]

4.9 Disasters in Topology III: Function Spaces (The Ascoli Theorem)
101
1. Let a0 be the smallest cluster point of the sequence (fn(r0)).
Deﬁne s0 = (g0
n)n∈N by induction as a subsequence (fν(n)) of (fn) as
follows:
a) ν(0)
= min{m ∈N | fm(r0) −a0| < 1}
b) ν(n + 1) = min{m ∈N | ν(n) < m and |fm(r0) −a0| <
1
n+1}.
Then s0 = (g0
n) = (fν(n)) is a subsequence of (fn), and (g0
n(r0)) →a0.
2. Let an and sn = (gn
m)m∈N be deﬁned. Let an+1 be the smallest cluster
point of the sequence (gn
m(rn+1))m∈N.
Deﬁne, as above via induction, (sn+1) = (gn+1
m
)m∈N as a subsequence of
(sn) = (gn
m)m∈N such that (gn+1
m
(rn+1))m∈N →an+1.
Next, consider the diagonal sequence s = (gn
n)n∈N. Then s is a subsequence
of (fn) and is coﬁnal with each of the sequences sn. Thus, for each n ∈N,
the sequence (s(rn)) =

gm
m(rn)

m∈N converges to an. Hence, for each
x ∈Q, the sequence s(x) = (gm
m(x))m∈N converges in R. Since Q is dense
in R, G = {gm
m | m ∈N} is equicontinuous, and R is complete, the familiar
arguments imply that s converges locally uniformly and thus continuously
to some map g: R →R with g(rn) = an for each n ∈N. Consequently (a)
holds.
Thus disaster struck again. However, a simple analysis of the above proof
immediately yields the following salvaged form of the Classical Ascoli Theo-
rem:

f : R →R the following conditions are equivalent:

{g(x) | g ∈G} is bounded.
(β) Each countable subset of F is equicontinuous.

4.10 Disasters in Topology IV: The Baire Category
Theorem
The applications of topology to analysis are usually manifested in
the form of an “existence theorem” of some sort and the major
share of the work in this direction is born, directly or indirectly,
by two theorems: the Tychonoﬀtheorem and the Baire category
theorem.
S. Willard146
The category theorem, given by R. Baire in 1899 is
one of the principal avenues through which applica-
tions of completeness are made in classical and func-
tional analysis.
A. Wilansky147
The relevance of the Baire Category theorem to the
fundamental metalogical principle of deductive com-
pleteness has long been known.
R. Goldblatt148
The above quotes indicate the usefulness of the Baire Category Theorem
in diﬀerent areas of mathematics. Like the Ascoli Theorem it comes in many
diﬀerent forms. We will restrict our attention to the more elementary forms
given below.
Deﬁnition 4.99. A topological space X is called Baire iﬀin X each countable
intersection of dense, open subsets is dense.
Deﬁnition 4.100. The Baire Category Theorem states that all com-
pletely149 metrizable spaces and all compact Hausdorﬀspaces are Baire.
Disaster 4.101.
1. There may exist completely metrizable spaces that fail
to be Baire.
2. There may exist compact Hausdorﬀspaces that fail to be Baire.
We will start by presenting classes of topological spaces that are Baire in
ZF and continue by widening these classes by stepwise adding set theoretical
conditions of increasing strength.

147 [Wila70, p. 178]
148 [Gol85]
149 A pseudometric space is called complete iﬀin X every Cauchy sequence con-
verges. For a completeness concept based on Cauchy ﬁlters see Exercise E 4.

4.10 Disasters in Topology IV: The Baire Category Theorem
103
Theorem 4.102. 150 Separable completely metrizable spaces are Baire.
Proof. Let X be a topological space with a compatible complete metric d. Let
(Bn) be a sequence of dense, open sets in X, let B be a non–empty open set
in X, and let {xn | n ∈N} be dense in X. For each n ∈N+ and each x ∈X,
deﬁne S(x, n) = {y ∈X | d(x, y) < 1
n} and T(x, y) = {y ∈X | d(x, y) ≤1
n}.
Construct, via recursion, a sequence (yn, rn) of pairs, with yn ∈X and rn > 0
as follows:
y0
= xmin{m∈N|xm∈(B∩B0)}
r0
= (min{m ∈N+ | T(y0, m) ⊆(B ∩B0)})−1 .
yn+1 = xmin{m∈N|xm∈(S(yn,rn)∩Bn+1)}.
rn+1 = min

1
n+1,
1
min{m∈N+|T (yn+1,m)⊆(S(yn,rn)∩Bn+1)}

.
Then (yn) is a Cauchy–sequence, which thus converges to some point y.
By construction,
y ∈(B ∩
n∈N
Bn). Thus 
n∈N
Bn is dense in X.
Theorem 4.103. 151 Countably compact pseudometrizable spaces are Baire.
Proof. Let X be a countably compact space with a compatible pseudometric
d. Let (Bn), B, S(x, n), and T(x, n) be as in the previous proof. Construct,
via recursion, a sequence of pairs (kn, An), consisting of positive integers kn
and non–empty, open subsets An of X, as follows:
k0
= min{m ∈N+ | ∃x ∈X T(x, m) ⊆(B ∩B0)}.
A0
= {S(x, k0) | T(x, k0) ⊆(B ∩B0)}.
kn+1 = min{m ∈N+ | ∃x ∈X T(x, m) ⊆(An ∩Bn+1)}.
An+1 = {S(x, kn+1) | T(x, kn+1) ⊆(An ∩Bn+1)}.
Then An+1 ⊆(An ∩Bn ∩B). Thus, by countable compactness of X,

Since each (Xn, dn) is complete and totally bounded, so is (X, d). Thus, by
(1) and Proposition 3.26, X is compact. Consequently Theorem 4.103 implies
that X is Baire.
(2) ⇒(3) Obvious.

6. XN is Baire, for each discrete space X.
7. (αX)N is Baire, for the 1–point–compactiﬁcation αX of each discrete space
X.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let X be a complete pseudometric space with pseudometric
d. For x ∈X and r > 0, deﬁne S(x, r) = {y ∈X | d(x, y) < r} and
T(x, r) = {y ∈X | d(x, y) ≤r}. Let (Bn) be a sequence of dense, open sets
in X.
Consider:
Y = {(n, x, r) ∈N × X × R | 0 < r < 2−n and T(x, r) ⊆(B ∩

Deﬁne a binary relation ϱ on Y by:
(n, x, r)ϱ(¯n, ¯x, ¯r) ⇔

n < ¯n and T(¯x, ¯r) ⊆S(x, r)

.
Then, for each y ∈Y , there exists some ¯y ∈Y with yϱ¯y. Thus, by (1), there
exists a sequence (yn) in Y with ynϱyn+1 for each n. This implies that, for
yn = (mn, xn, rn), the sequence (xn) is Cauchy and thus converges to some

consisting of n ∈N and non–empty, open subsets A of X such that clA, the
closure of A, is contained in B ∩
m≤n
Bm. Deﬁne a binary relation ϱ on Y by:
(n, A)ϱ(¯n, ¯A) ⇔(n < ¯n and cl ¯A ⊆A).
Then, for each y ∈Y , there exists ¯y ∈Y with yϱ¯y. Thus, by (1), there
exists a sequence (yn) in Y with ynϱyn+1 for each n. This implies that, for

Baire. For each n ∈N, deﬁne
Bm = {(xn) ∈Y | ∃n ∈N xmϱxn}.
Then the Bm’s are dense and open in the non–empty space Y . Thus there

Remark 4.107. By the above theorem the complete metric version of the
Baire Category Theorem is equivalent to DC. Whether the compact Hausdorﬀ
version is not only implied by DC, but also equivalent to DC (resp., whether
condition (3a) implies (3b) — and thus DC) remains an open question, cf.
Exercises E 5. However, it is known that condition (3b) does not imply (3a)
— and hence DC, as pointed out in Remark 4.73.
Further variants of the Baire Category Theorem can be obtained by mod-
ifying the concept of completeness. For a completeness concept, obtained by
means of Cauchy ﬁlters instead of Cauchy sequences see Exercises E 4. Discus-
sions of more complicated completeness concepts such as ˇCech–completeness,
pseudo–completeness, regular–closedness or pseudocompactness are beyond the
scope of this book. See in particular [Oxt61], [Gol85], [HeKe99].

4.10 Disasters in Topology IV: The Baire Category Theorem
107
Let us ﬁnally turn to another variant of the compactness concept, namely
to ultraﬁlter–compactness, in order to demonstrate that even DC may not
always suﬃce to obtain a suitable variant of the Baire Category Theorem.
Theorem 4.108. 155 Equivalent are:
1. DC and WUF.
2. DC and WUF(N)
3. Regular, ultraﬁlter–compact spaces are Baire.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Obvious.
(2) ⇒(1) Let X be an inﬁnite set. By Theorems 2.12 and 2.14, X is
D–inﬁnite, i.e., there exists an injection f : N →X: Let U be a free ultraﬁlter
on N. Then {V ⊆X | f −1[V ] ∈U} is a free ultraﬁlter on X.
(2) ⇒(3) Let X be a regular ultraﬁlter–compact space, let (Bn) be a
sequence of dense, open sets in X, and let B be a non–empty open set in
X. Construct — as in the proof of the implication (1) ⇒(3) of Theorem
4.106 — a sequence (An) of non–empty open sets in X with clAn+1 ⊆An for
each n ∈N, and 
n∈N
An = 
n∈N
clAn ⊆(B ∩
m∈N
Bm). By Theorem 2.12 there
exists an element (an) in 
n∈N
An. If A = {an | n ∈N} is ﬁnite, there exists
some a ∈A that is contained in inﬁnitely many and thus in all Am’s, and
consequently in B ∩
m∈N
Bm. Otherwise, A is countable, thus there exists a
free ultraﬁlter U on A. Consequently W = {V ⊆X | (V ∩A) ∈U} is a free
ultraﬁlter on X, and hence converges to some point x. As a cluster point of
W, x belongs to clAn for each n ∈N, and thus to B ∩
m∈N
Bm.
(3) ⇒(2) Let X be a discrete space, let αX be the 1–point–compacti-
ﬁcation of X, and let Y = (αX)N be the corresponding product. Then Y
is a regular, ultraﬁlter–compact space, thus, by (3), Baire. Hence DC holds
by Theorem 4.106. If there would be no free ultraﬁlter on N, then the space
Q would be a regular, ultraﬁlter–compact space which fails to be Baire —
contradicting condition (3).
Note that the conditions DC and WUF are independent of each other.
There exist models156 of ZF that satisfy PIT and hence WUF but not DC;
and vice versa, there exist models157 of ZF that satisfy DC, but fail to satisfy
even WUF(?).

I am sure that a2 > 4 but cannot prove it.
P. Erd¨os168
To investigate coloring problems in graph theory we need to build up some
terminology ﬁrst:
Terminology 4.109. A graph is a pair (X, ϱ), consisting of a set X, whose
elements are called vertices, and a symmetric, antireﬂexive binary relation ϱ
on X (i.e., xϱy ⇒(yϱx and x ̸= y)), whose elements (x, y) are called edges.
A homomorphism f : (X, ϱ) →(Y, σ) between graphs is a map f : X →Y

The problem we are concerned with is whether a given graph is n–
colorable, where n is some natural number. Obviously, n + 1 is not n–
colorable. A necessary condition for the n–colorability of a graph G is that
each of its ﬁnite subgraphs is n–colorable. In ZFC this condition is also suf-
ﬁcient:
Theorem 4.110. In ZFC, for each n, the following conditions on a graph G
are equivalent:
1. G is n–colorable.
2. Each ﬁnite subgraph of G is n–colorable.
Proof. See Theorems 4.113 and 4.115 below.
The above result remains true in ZF only for n = 0 or n = 1.
Disaster 4.111. It may happen that every ﬁnite subgraph of some graph G
is 2–colorable, but G fails to be n–colorable for any n.
Proof. Let (Xn)n∈N be a sequence of 2–element sets with 
n∈N
Xn = ∅. Consider
the graph G = (X, ϱ) deﬁned by
X = 
n∈N
(Xn × {n})
ϱ ={

(x, n), (y, m)

∈X2 | n=m and x̸=y}
.
Then every ﬁnite subgraph of G is 2–colorable, but G is n–colorable for no
n ∈N.
For connected graphs and n = 2, Theorem 4.110 can be salvaged however:
Proposition 4.112. For connected graphs G, the following conditions are
equivalent:
1. G is 2–colorable.
2. Every ﬁnite subgraph of G is 2–colorable.
Proof. Let every ﬁnite subgraph of the connected graph G = (X, ϱ) be 2–
colorable. If G is empty, nothing more need be said. Otherwise select an
element a in x, and deﬁne, for each x ∈X, n(x) to be the smallest n ∈N such
that there exists some (n+1)–tuple (x0, x1, . . . , xn) in X with x0 = a, xn = x,
and xiϱxi+1 for i = 0, . . . , n −1. Then the function f : G →2, deﬁned by
f(x) =

0, if n(x) is even
1, if n(x) is odd,
is a 2–coloration of G. (Cf. Exercise E 1).
Combining the ideas that enter into the proofs of the results 4.111 and
4.112, we obtain:

Theorem 4.113. 169 Equivalent are:
1. If every ﬁnite subgraph of a graph G is 2–colorable, then so is G.
2. AC(2).
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of 2–element sets. Consider the
graph G = (X, ϱ), deﬁned by
X = 
i∈I
(Xi × {i})
ϱ = {

(x, i), (y, j)

∈X2 | i = j and x ̸= y}.
Then every ﬁnite subgraph of G is 2–colorable. Thus, by (1), G itself is
2–colorable. Let f : G →2 be a 2–coloration of G. Then, for each i ∈I, there
exists precisely one element xi of Xi with f(xi, i) = 0. Thus (xi)i∈I ∈
i∈I
Xi.
(2) ⇒(1) Let G = (X, ϱ) be a non–empty graph, such that all of its ﬁnite
subgraphs are 2–colorable. Call a subset C of X a component of G provided
that the subgraph (C, ϱC) of G, determined by C, is a maximal connected
subgraph of G. Let I be the set of all components of G. Then for each C in I,
the graph (C, ϱC) is connected and hence by Proposition 4.112, 2–colorable.
Moreover, as can be seen easily (cf. Exercise E 2) for each C in I, the set
XC of all 2–colorations of (C, ϱC) contains precisely 2 elements. Thus, by (2),
there exists a family (fC)C∈I of 2–colorations fC : (C, ϱC) →2. Consequently
the function f : G →2, deﬁned by
f(x) = fC(x), if x ∈C
is a 2–coloration of G.
As can be seen easily (cf. Exercise E 3), the implication (1) ⇒(2) of the
above Theorem 4.113 remains valid if the number 2 is replaced by any natural
number n ≥3. However, the inverse implication (2) ⇒(1) may fail.
Disaster 4.114. Even under AC(3), there may exist graphs that fail to be
3–colorable even though all their ﬁnite subgraphs are 3–colorable.
Proof. This follows from the next theorem and the fact 170 that AC(3) does
not imply PIT.
Theorem 4.115. 171 Equivalent are:
1. If every ﬁnite subgraph of a graph G is 3–colorable, then so is G.
2. PIT.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let B be a Boolean algebra with 0 ̸= 1. We will construct
a graph G = (X, ϱ) such that

(a) Each ﬁnite subgraph of G is 3–colorable.
(b) If G is 3–colorable, then B has a maximal ideal.
This then, together with (1), will imply (2).
G will be constructed in 3 steps.
Step 1: G1 = (X1, ϱ1) with X1 = B and ϱ1 = {(x, x∗) | x ∈B}, where x∗
is the complement of x in B.
Step 2: G2 = (X2, ϱ2) with X2 = X1 ∪{a}, where a is some element not
contained in X1 and ϱ2 = ϱ1 ∪({a} × X1) ∪(X1 × {a}).
Step 3: Let P be the set of all subsets {x, y} of B such that x and y are
neither comparable nor dual to each other. Associate with each {x, y} ∈P a
graph G(x, y) =

A(x, y), ϱ(x, y)

X = X2 ∪

{x,y}∈P
A(x, y)
ϱ = ϱ2 ∪

{x,y}∈P
ϱ(x, y).
Step 1
guarantees that any 3–coloration f of G satisﬁes f(x) ̸= f(x∗) for
each x ∈B.
Step 2
guarantees that every 3–coloration f of G induces a 2–coloration
of G1 and that every 2–coloration of G1 can be extended to a 3–coloration of
G2.
Step 3
guarantees that, for each {x, y} ∈P, a map f : {x, y, x ∨y} →3
can be extended to a 3–coloration ˜f of G(x, y) if and only if f satisﬁes the
condition:
(*)
If f(x) = f(y) then f is constant.
Now we can prove (a) and (b):
Proof of (a): Let H = (Z, ϱZ) be a ﬁnite subgraph of G. Then there exists a
ﬁnite subalgebra K of B with Z ⊆

K ∪{a} ∪

{x,y}∈(P ∩PK)
A(x, y)

.
As a ﬁnite Boolean algebra with 0 ̸= 1, K has a maximal ideal I. Its
complement F = K\I has the form F = {x ∈K | x∗∈I}. We construct a
3–coloration G: H →3 in 3 steps:
Step 1: For x ∈(Z ∩X1), deﬁne G(x) =
 0, if x ∈I
1, if x ∈F .
Step 2: If a ∈Z, deﬁne G(a) = 2.

4.11 Disasters in Graph Theory: Coloring Problems
113
Step 3: If z ∈

Z∩A(x, y)

for some {x, y} ∈(P ∩PK), deﬁne g(z) = ˜f(z),
where f is the restriction of g to the set {x, y, x ∨y} and ˜f is a 3–coloration
extension to G(x, y), which exists since f satisﬁes the condition (*).
Proof of (b): Let f : G →3 be a 3–coloration of G. Assume w.l.o.g. that
f(a) = 2 and f(0) = 0. Deﬁne I = B ∩f −1(0). Then F = B ∩f −1(1) is the
complement B\I of I in B. Moreover, ϱ1 ⊆ϱ implies that F = {x∗| x ∈I}.
Furthermore, for {x, y} ∈(P ∩PI) we must have (x ∨y) ∈I, since otherwise
the restriction of f to {x, y, x∨y} would violate the above condition (*). Thus
I is closed under joins x∨y. Analogously F is closed under joins x∨y. Hence,
by Exercise E 5, I is a maximal ideal in B.
(2) ⇒(1) Let G = (X, ϱ) be a graph such that each ﬁnite subgraph of G
is 3–colorable. Let I be the set of all ﬁnite subgraphs of G. For each K ∈I
let CK be the set of all 3–colorations of K. Consider each CK as a ﬁnite,
discrete topological space. Then, by (2) and Exercises to Section 4.8, E 7,
the product space C =

K∈I
CK is compact and non–empty. For every pair
(L, R) of elements of I with L ⊆R, the set A(L, R) = {(fK) ∈C | f|L
is the restriction fR to L} is closed in C. Moreover, the sets A(L, R) have
the ﬁnite intersection property. Thus compactness of C implies that there
exists some element (fK)K∈I in the intersection of all the A(L, R)’s. For each
x ∈X consider the subgraph Kx = ({x}, ∅) of G, and deﬁne f : X →3 by
f(x) = fKx(x). Then f : G →3 is a 3–coloration of G.

As is well known there are just as many (Lebesgue–) measurable
sets as there are non–measurable ones: namely 2ℵ[where ℵ= |R|].
This is peculiar since we are used to the fact that in real analysis
the pathologies predominate.
J. von Neumann1
However, as von Neumann points out, the above anomaly is only appar-
ent — caused by the fact that there are so many sets of measure zero (namely
2ℵ). If sets A and B are called equivalent provided that their symmetric
diﬀerence A∆B is of measure zero, the normal pathology of real analysis in
the ZFC–setting is restored: there are still 2ℵequivalence classes consisting of
non–measurable sets (equivalently: containing a non–measurable set) but only
ℵequivalence classes consisting of measurable sets (equivalently: containing a
measurable set).
Observe further that not even complex analysis is devoid of pathologies.
See, e.g., Exercises to Section 5.1, E 7.

Though the Axiom of Choice is responsible for many beautiful results, it
is equally responsible for the existence of several dreadful monstrosities —
unwelcome and unneeded.
Deﬁnition 5.1. The equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) is called the Cauchy–
equation.
Consider a function f : R →R that satisﬁes the Cauchy–equation for all real
x and y. Then it is easily seen that
•
f(r · x) = r · f(x)
for all rational r and real x, i.e., f is Q–linear.
In particular:
•
f(r) = f(1) · r
for all rational r.
So continuity of f would imply:
•
f(x) = f(1) · x
for all x ∈R.
Are there solutions of the Cauchy–equation that fail to be continuous?
None has ever been constructed and in ZF none will ever be, since there
are ZF–models without non–continuous solutions of the Cauchy–equation3.
However the Axiom of Choice guarantees the existence of such monsters4;
even worse, under AC there are far more undesirable solutions of the Cauchy–
equation than there are desirable ones:
Disaster 5.2. In ZFC there are
1. 2ℵ0 continuous solutions f : R →R, and
2. 2(2ℵ0) non–continuous solutions f : R →R of the Cauchy–equation.
Proof. (1) For each r ∈R the function f : R →R, deﬁned by f(x) = r · x is a
continuous solution of the equation (1). There are no others, as noted above.
(2) In ZFC, R, considered as a vector space over Q, has a basis B, also
called a Hamel basis. Moreover, a simple computation shows that |B| = 2ℵ0.
Since any map B →R can be extended uniquely to a linear map R →R,
there are precisely
|RB| = |R||B| = (2ℵ0)2ℵ0 = 2ℵ0·2ℵ0 = 2(2ℵ0)
solutions to be Cauchy–equation. Since only 2ℵ0 of these are continuous, there
are 2(2ℵ0) non–continuous ones.
Moreover, the non–continuous solutions of the Cauchy–equation have
rather strange and unwanted features.
3
E.g., Shelah’s Second Model A2 (M38 in [HoRu98]).
4
Observe, however that, although AC is the culprit in the present case, similar
monsters can be constructed in ZF. See Exercise E 9.

5.1 Disasters in Elementary Analysis
119
Deﬁnition 5.3. Non–continuous solutions of the Cauchy–equation are called
ugly.
Theorem 5.4. 5 If f : R →R is ugly, then its graph
G(f) = {

x, f(x)

| x ∈R} is dense in R2.
Proof. Let (x, y) be an element of R2 and let U be a neighborhood of (x, y)
in R2. Since f is ugly there exist real numbers a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0 such that the
quotients α = f(a)
a
and β = f(b)
b
are diﬀerent. Consequently, u =

a, f(a)

and v =

b, f(b)

are linearly independent vectors in the real vector space R2,
and thus form a basis of R2. Consequently, there exist real numbers6 p and q
with (x, y) = p·u+q ·v. Since Q2 is dense in R2 and the expression p·u+q ·v
depends continuously on p and q, there exist rational numbers ¯p and ¯q with
(¯p · u + ¯q · v) ∈U. However
¯p · u + ¯q · v =

¯p · a + ¯q · b, ¯p · f(a) + ¯q · f(b)

=

¯p · a + ¯q · b, f(¯p · a + ¯q · b)

.
Thus (¯p · u + ¯q · v) ∈

U ∩G(f)

.
Theorem 5.5. 7 Ugly functions are non–measurable.
Proof. Let f be ugly. Assume8 w.l.o.g. that there exist real numbers a ̸= 0
and b ̸= 0 with f(a) = 1 and f(b) = 0. For n ∈Z, deﬁne An = f −1[n, n + 1)
and choose qn ∈Q with |n · a −qn · b| < 1
2. Deﬁne B0 = A0 ∩[−1
2, 3
2] and
Bn = B0 + n · a −qn · b = {x + n · a −qn · b | x ∈B0} for n ̸= 0.
Then x ∈(An ∩[0, 1]) implies that y = x −(n · a −qn · b) ∈(A0 ∩[−1
2, 3
2]),
i.e., y ∈B0, and thus x = y + (n · a −qn · b) ∈Bn. Consequently
(An ∩[0, 1]) ⊆Bn ⊆[−1, 2].
Thus:
[0, 1] = [0, 1] ∩

n∈Z
An =

n∈N

Bn ⊆[−1, 2].
This implies that B0 (and hence A0) are non–measurable, since otherwise

measure µ(Bn) = µ(B0) and thus9

and replace
f by the function g, deﬁned by g(x) = (b · f(a) −a · f(b))−1 · (b · f(x) −f(b) · x).

Here we use σ–additivity of Lebesgue–measure (which requires some choice prin-
ciple, cf. Exercise E 13.). However, our use of choice principles can be avoided.

2. 2(2ℵ0) non–measurable subsets of R.
Proof. (1) Immediate from Disaster 5.2 and Theorem 5.5.
(2) The existence of non–measurable subsets of R follows immediately
from (1). Their number is computed easily via the following “construction”
of the Vitali monsters.
5.7. The Vitali Monsters10 V
Let ϱ be the equivalence relation on R, deﬁned by
xϱy ⇔(x −y) ∈Q.
Then each of the equivalence classes w.r.t. ϱ is dense in R, thus meets the
interval [0, 1]. By AC(R), there exists a subset V of [0, 1] that contains pre-
cisely one element of each of these equivalence classes. The set I = Q∩[−1, 1]
is countable. For each r ∈I deﬁne Vr = {v + r | v ∈V }. Then A = 
r∈I
Vr is
a countable union of pairwise disjoint sets satisfying [0, 1] ⊆A ⊆[−1, 2]. If V
would be measurable then each of the Vr’s would be measurable and would
have the same measure as V . Thus A would be measurable and its measure
would be 0, in case V would have measure 0, and ∞, otherwise. The former is
not possible, since [0, 1] ⊆A; and the latter is not possible, since A ⊆[−1, 2].
Consequently, V is not measurable. Since there are precisely 2ℵ0 equivalence
classes w.r.t. ϱ, there exist precisely ℵ(2ℵ0)
0
= 2(2ℵ0) Vitali Monsters.
Here follow some diﬀerent monster productions in ZFC:
5.8. The Bernstein Monsters11 B
Since the space of reals has a countable base, it has precisely 2ℵ0 open
sets, and thus precisely 2ℵ0 closed sets. By means of AC(R) it is easily de-
duced that each uncountable closed subset of R contains at least two complete
accumulation points, thus a Cantor set, and thus has cardinality 2ℵ0. Let A
be the set of all uncountable closed subsets of [0, 1]. Then |A| = |R| = 2ℵ0.
By AC(R), 2ℵ0 = ℵfor some Aleph ℵ. Thus A can be expressed in the form
A = {Aα | α < ℵ}. Let f : P0(R) →R be a map that satisﬁes f(X) ∈X

for each non–empty subset X of R. Construct, via transﬁnite recursion, a
transﬁnite sequence (xα, yα)α<ℵin [0, 1]2 as follows:
Assume that α < ℵ, and that (xβ, yβ)β<α have been deﬁned already. Then
the set F = {xβ | β < α} ∪{yβ | β < α} has cardinality less than ℵ. Thus
Aα \ F is not empty, and is in fact of cardinality ℵ. Deﬁne:
xα = f[Aα \ F]
yα = f[Aα \ (F ∪{xα})].
Then the sets B = {xα | α < ℵ} and C = [0, 1] \ B form a partition of [0, 1],
and each member of A meets each of the sets B and C. In other words: no
member of A is contained in B or in C. Hence every closed subset of B resp.
of C is at most countable, and thus has Lebesgue–measure zero. Thus, if B
would be Lebesgue measurable, then so would be C and both would have
Lebesgue measure zero, which is impossible since their union B ∪C = [0, 1]
has Lebesgue measure one.
5.9. The Sierpi´nski Monsters12 S
Consider a free ultraﬁlter U on N. Then the following hold:
1. A ∈U ⇔(N \ A) ̸∈U
for each A ⊆N.
2. (A ∈U and F ⊆N ﬁnite) ⇒(A∆F) ∈U.13
For each A ⊆N, let χA : N →{0, 1} be the characteristic function of A, i.e.,
A = χ−1
A (1). Consider X = {0, 1}N. Deﬁne, for x = (xn)n∈N, the element
x∗= (1 −xn)n∈N. With S = {χU | U ∈U} the above conditions (1) and (2)
translate into
(1*) X \ S = {x∗| x ∈S},

(xn)n∈N ∈S

Consider the normed product measure µ on X, invariant under the oper-
ation ∗. If S would be µ–measurable, then so would be X \ S and, by (1*),
µ(S) = µ(X \ S) would hold. Thus µ(S) = µ(X \ S) = 1
2.
But by (2*), Kolmogoroﬀ’s Zero–One–Law14 would imply that either
µ(S) = 0 or µ(S) = 1; a contradiction. From these observations it follows
that g[S] is not Lebesgue measurable, where g: X →[0, 1] is deﬁned by

Besides monstrosities the Axiom of Choice produces also some harmless
but somewhat bizarre curiosities. Here an example:
Curiosity 5.11. 16 In ZFC there exists a subset of the plane that meets
every straight line, lying in the plane, in exactly two points.
Proof. The set L of all straight lines l in the plane P has cardinality 2ℵ0, and
so has each of the lines l. By AC, 2ℵ0 is an aleph ℵ. So L can be written in the
form L = {lα | α < ℵ}. Also by AC, there exists a function f : P0(P) →P
with f(A) ∈A for each non–empty subset A of P. Via transﬁnite recursion
we deﬁne a transﬁnite sequence (Cα)α<ℵof subsets of P such that |Cα| < ℵ
and |Cα ∩lβ| ≤2 for each α < ℵand β < ℵ.
Consider α < ℵ, assume that Cβ is deﬁned for all β < α. Let α′ be the
smallest of all γ < ℵsuch that |lγ ∩
β<α
Cβ| ≤1. Since | 
γ<α′(lγ ∩lα′)| < ℵ, the
set Bα = lα′ \ ( 
γ<α′lγ ∪
β<α
Cβ) is non–empty. Deﬁne Cα = 
β<α
Cβ ∪f(Bα).
Then C = 
α<ℵ
Cα meets every l ∈L in exactly 2 points.

5.2 Disasters in Geometry: Paradoxical Decompositions
At ﬁrst glance, the Banach–Tarski Decomposition seems prepos-
terous. It blatantly contradicts our intuition about the conservation
of mass or volume.
E. Schechter26
It certainly does seem to be folly to claim that a billiard ball can
be chopped into pieces which can be put back together to form a
life-size statue of Banach.
K. Stromberg27
I think there is still something very disturbing about the Banach–
Tarski paradox.
S. Fefermann28
Intuition is an important guide for mathematicians. However, it is not al-
ways a safe one. There exist mathematical results that are counterintuitive.
In many of these cases, a culprit can be isolated: the Axiom of Choice, i.e.,
many paradoxical results are demonstrable in ZFC, but not in ZF. The most
stunning of these is the so called Banach–Tarski Paradox which establishes
the existence of rather bizarre decompositions of the unit ball and of other
heavenly bodies. The construction of these paradoxical decompositions is mo-
tivated by measure theoretic considerations. As we have seen in the previous
section, the axiom of choice allows the construction of non–measurable sub-
sets of the reals. The main obstacle — besides AC — turned out to be the
requirement that the measure–function be σ–additive. What happens, if we re-
lax this condition by requiring just additivity, but add the natural requirement
that congruent (i.e., isometric) sets have the same measure? The paradoxi-
cal decompositions, unearthed by Hausdorﬀ29and by Banach and Tarski30 by
means of the Axiom of Choice, demonstrate that in R3, the 3–dimensional
space, even such functions, describing the volume of bounded bodies, do not
exist. For n = 1 and n = 2 such measures do exist, as shown by Banach31 —
however (as we will point out later) they have some rather bizarre properties,
as shown by von Neumann32.

To prove these results is beyond the scope of this monograph. However,
we will outline the main ideas, referring the interested reader for the more
technical details to the elegant and “strictly elementary account” given in
[Str79] or to the comprehensive book [Wag86], “where this striking theorem
[the Banach–Tarski Paradox] and many related results in geometry and mea-
sure theory, and the underlying tools of group theory, are presented with care
and enthusiasm.”33
To describe the measure–theoretic results, concerning the spaces Rn, we
will use (in this section) the following terminology:
Deﬁnition 5.12. For n ∈N+, an n–dimensional measure is a function
µn : PbRn →R+, deﬁned on the set PbRn of bounded subsets of Rn, satis-
fying the following conditions:
(M1)
µn is additive, i.e., µ(A∪B) = µ(A)+µ(B) for disjoint elements
A and B of PbRn.
(M2)
µ is invariant, i.e., A ≈B implies µn(A) = µn(B), where A
and B are called congruent, shortly A ≈B, iﬀthere exists an
isometry34f : Rn →Rn with f[A] = B.
(M3)
µn is normed, i.e., µn([0, 1]n) = 1.
NOTE: In this section we work — unless stated otherwise — in ZFC
Hausdorﬀ’s Paradoxical Decomposition of the Sphere
Hausdorﬀ35 was the ﬁrst to show that 3–dimensional measures (and hence
n–dimensional measures for any n ≥3; see Exercise E 1) do not exist. He
obtained this result by exhibiting a paradoxical decomposition of the sphere:
5.13. Hausdorﬀ’s Decomposition Theorem for the Unit Sphere36
There exists a partition {A, B, C, D} of the unit sphere
S2 = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 | x2 + y2 + z2 = 1} such that:
1. A ≈B ≈C.
2. A ≈(B ∪C).
3. D is countable.
Later we will indicate the idea of the proof of the above Theorem. First,
however, some consequences.

Corollary 5.14. 37 There is no function µ: PbS2 →R+ which satisﬁes (M1),
(M2) and (M3’) µ(S2) > 0.
Proof. Assume that a function µ, satisfying (M1), (M2), and (M3’), exists.
The countability of D implies that there exists an isometry f of the sphere S2
(in fact a rotation) such that D and f[D] are disjoint. Hence D1 = (D∪f[D]) is
a countable subset of S2 with µ(D1) = 2·µ(D). By repeating this process one
obtains, for each n ∈N+, a countable subset Dn of S2 with µ(Dn) = 2n·µ(D).
Since µ(Dn) ≤µ(S2) for each n, this implies µ(D) = 0. Consequently: µ(S2) =
µ(A)+µ(B)+µ(C) = 3·µ(A) and µ(S2) = µ(B∪C)+µ(B)+µ(C) = 4·µ(A).
Therefore µA = 0, hence µ(S) = 0, a contradiction.
Corollary 5.15. 38 There is no 3–dimensional measure.
Proof. If µ3 would be a 3–dimensional measure, then the function
µ: PbS2 →R+, deﬁned by
µ(A) = µ3

{(λx, λy, λz) | (x, y, z) ∈A and 0 < λ ≤1}

would satisfy (M1), (M2), and (M3’), contradicting Corollary 5.14.
Looking back at Hausdorﬀ’s Theorem 5.13 one observes that the existence
of the countable set D somewhat reduces its elegance. Is there a smoother
result? Sierpi´nski39 showed that there are partitions
P1 = {A1, . . . , A6, B1, . . . , B4},
P2 = {C1, . . . , C6} and
P3 = {D1, . . . , D4}
of the sphere such that
1. Ai ≈Ci for i = 1, . . . , 6,
2. Bi ≈Di for i = 1, . . . , 4.
Though here the countable set is avoided, the number of pieces is unnec-
essary large as shown by Robinson:
5.16. Robinson’s Decomposition Theorem for the Unit Sphere40
There exists a partition {A1, A2, B1, B2} of the unit sphere into con-
nected and locally connected pieces such that A1 ≈A2 ≈A1 ∪A2 and
B1 ≈B2 ≈B1 ∪B2.
This is, in a way, the best (or worst?) possible result. As Robinson himself
formulates41:

“Thus we may cut S2 into four pieces, and reassemble them in pairs
to form two copies of S2. We cannot use fewer than four pieces, since
we cannot form a copy of S2 out of a single piece which is not all of
S2. Thus for the surface problem, the minimum number of pieces in
which to cut S2 is four.”
Bad Groups
After Banach and Tarski42 had improved Hausdorﬀ’s construction to obtain
simpler and more striking decompositions of 3–dimensional bodies (see be-
low), von Neumann43 showed that — besides AC — the structure of the
group of isometries of R3 is responsible for the possibility of such paradoxical
decompositions and thus the non-existence of 3–dimensional measures. This
group contains a free group on two generators — and this fact causes all the
trouble. In von Neumann’s own words44:
Der Euklidische Raum scheint danach beim Erreichen der Dimensions-
zahl 3 j¨ah seinen Charakter zu ¨andern: f¨ur n < 3 l¨aßt er einen allge-
meinen Maßbegriﬀnoch zu, f¨ur n ≥3 nicht mehr!
Daß dem nicht so ist, daß vielmehr der innere Grund dieses son-
derbaren Ph¨anomens eine gewisse gruppentheoretische Eigenheit der
n–dimensionalen Drehgruppe ist, dies zu zeigen, ist der Hauptzweck
der vorliegenden Arbeit.
. . .
Der pl¨otzliche Charakterwechsel des Euklidischen Raumes beim Erre-
ichen und ¨Uberschreiten der Dimensionszahl 3 liegt einfach daran, daß
die — bisher allein ber¨ucksichtigte — Gruppe On der l¨angentreuen Ab-
bildungen f¨ur n = 1, 2 “auﬂ¨osbar” ist, f¨ur n = 3, 4, . . . hingegen eine
freie Untergruppe mit zwei Erzeugenden σ, τ hat.”

Translation: “Apparently Euclidean space changes its character abruptly when
reaching dimension 3: for n < 3 it allows a general concept of measure, for
n ≥3 this is no longer the case!
To show that this is not so, that rather the deeper reason for this strange phe-
nomenon is a speciﬁc group theoretic peculiarity of the n–dimensional isometry
group, is the main purpose of the present article.
. . .
The abrupt change of character of Euclidean space when reaching and passing
dimension 3 is simply caused by the fact that the group On of isometries —
the only one that has been considered so far — is “solvable” for n = 1, 2, but
contains a free group with two generators σ, τ for n = 3, 4, . . . .”

Deﬁnition 5.17.
1. The free group F2 on two generators a and b is the set
of all words x1x2 . . . xn with letters a, b, a−1, and b−1 such that a and a−1
are never adjacent and neither are b and b−1; supplied with the following
multiplication: If w = x1 . . . xn and v = y1 . . . ym are elements of F2, then
w · v is obtained in several steps:
Step 1: Concatenate w and v to obtain x1 . . . xny1 . . . ym.
Step 2: Remove xn and y1 provided that {xn, y1} = {a, a−1} or {xn, y1}
= {b, b−1}.
Step 3: Repeat step 2 as often as necessary until an element of F2 is ob-
tained.
The empty word, i.e., the word with no letters, denoted sometimes by Λ,
is the neutral element of F2.
2. x · Y = {xy | y ∈Y } for x ∈F2 and Y ⊆F2.
3. Subsets X and Y of F2 are called congruent, in symbols X ≈Y , provided
that there exists some z ∈F2 with Y = z · X.
Theorem 5.18. 45 There exists a partition {A, B, C, D} of the free group F2
such that:
1. A ≈(A ∪C ∪D).
2. C ≈(A ∪B ∪C).
Proof.
To demonstrate simultaneously the main idea of the proof and the
technical diﬃculty that has to be overcome, we present ﬁrst an argument that
almost works, next a complete proof.
Attempt: Deﬁne
A = {x1 . . . xn ∈F2 | x1 = a},
B = {x1 . . . xn ∈F2 | x1 = a−1},
C = {x1 . . . xn ∈F2 | x1 = b},
D = {x1 . . . xn ∈F2 | x1 = b−1}.
Then {A, B, C, D} is almost a partition of F2. Just the empty word Λ is
missing. Moreover:
A ≈a−1 · A = A ∪C ∪D ∪{Λ},
C ≈b−1 · C = A ∪B ∪C ∪{Λ}.
So, the empty word muddles things up and causes a correct proof to be
slightly less symmetric, hence less elegant:
Proof. Deﬁne A and B as above, but redeﬁne C and D as follows:
C = {x1 . . . xn ∈F2 | x1 = b} ∪{b−n | n ∈N}46,
D = F2\(A ∪B ∪C) = {x1 . . . xn ∈F2 | x1 = b−1}\{b−n | n ∈N}.
Then {A, B, C, D} is a partition of F2, and:
A ≈a−1 · A = A ∪C ∪D,
C ≈b−1 · C = A ∪B ∪C.

for subsets of X iﬀthere exists g ∈G with g[A] = B:
Theorem 5.19. 47 If F2 acts ﬁxpoint–free on X, then there exists a partition
{A, B, C, D} of X with
1. A ≈(A ∪C ∪D).
2. C ≈(A ∪B ∪C).
Proof. Let {A, B, C, D} be a partition of F2 with A ≈(A ∪C ∪D) and
(C ≈A ∪B ∪C). For each x ∈X let orb(x) = {g(x) | g ∈F2} be the orbit of
x. Then {orb(x) | x ∈X} is a partition of X. By AC there exists a subset S
of X that contains exactly one element from each orbit. Deﬁne
A∗= {g(x) | g ∈A and x ∈S}
and analogously B∗, C∗, and D∗. Since F2 acts ﬁxpoint–free on X, the set
{A∗, B∗, C∗, D∗} is a partition of X. Obviously:
A∗≈(A∗∪C∗∪D∗) and C∗≈(A∗∪B∗∪C∗}.
Paradoxical Decompositions of the Unit Ball
The above observations lead naturally to the following considerations: The
group of all isometries of R3 contains a subgroup that is isomorphic to F2 and
acts on the unit ball B3 = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 | x2 + y2 + z2 ≤1}48.
If this acting would be ﬁxpoint–free, then the above results would imme-
diately lead to a paradoxical decomposition of B3 into 4 pieces. The fact,
however, that rotations do have ﬁxpoints — fortunately, not too many —
causes complications. In fact, a paradoxical decomposition of B3 in 4 pieces
is impossible49. However, Banach and Tarski have been able to demonstrate
the following:
47
[vNeu29]
48
Hausdorﬀ, in his proof of the Decomposition Theorem 5.13, did not use a free
subgroup of the isometry group of S2, but rather one that is almost free, by
showing that there exist rotations α and β of S2 such that α2 = id = β3 are
the only relations in the group G generated by {α, β}. Each element g of G has
precisely two ﬁxpoints. The union of these ﬁxpoint–sets is Haudorﬀ’s countable
set D. Then Hausdorﬀconstructs judiciously a partition {A, B, C} of G such
that βA = B, β2A = C, and αA = B ∪C. If X is a set obtained by selecting
exactly one element from the orbit of each point x ∈(S2\D), then the partition
{A · X, B · X, C · X} of S2 \ D has the required properties.

Moreover, Robinson showed that 4 pieces do not suﬃce.
The Banach–Tarski Paradox
Since, by the last two theorems, any ball in 3–dimensional space can be “dou-
bled”, it follows easily that for any bounded subset A of R3 and any ball B
in R3 there exist a partition {A1, . . . , An} of A and a partition {B1, . . . , Bn}
of some subset of B such that Ai ≈Bi for each i = 1, . . . , n (see Exercise E
2). Thus for subsets A and B of R3 that are bounded and contain some ball
each, it is possible to decompose each into a ﬁnite number of pieces and to
“reassemble” these pieces to form a subset of the other set.

Deﬁnition 5.22. 57 Subsets A and B of R3 are called equidecomposable in
symbols, A ∼e B, iﬀthere exist partitions {A1, . . . , An} of A and {B1, . . . , Bn}
of B with Ai ≈Bi for i = 1, . . . , n.
5.23. The Banach–Tarski Paradox58 Any two bounded subsets A and B
of R3, that contain some ball each, are equidecomposable.
Proof. By the above remarks, each of the sets A and B is equidecomposable
to some subset of the other. Thus the result follows immediately from the
next theorem.
Theorem 5.24. 59 If subsets A and B of R3 are each equidecomposable to
some subset of the other, then A and B are equidecomposable.
Proof. Let {A1, . . . , An} be a partition of A and let {B1, . . . , Bn} be a parti-
tion of a subset B′ of B with Ai ≈Bi for each i. Then for each i = 1, . . . , n
there exists an isometry fi : Ai →Bi. Thus the map f : A →B′, deﬁned by
f(a) = fi(a) for a ∈Ai, is a bijection satisfying the condition:
(A)
C ∼e f[C] for each subset C of A.
Likewise there exists a bijection g: B →A′ from B to some subset A′ of
A, satisfying the condition
(B)
D ∼e g[D] for each subset D of B.
Deﬁne, via recursion, a sequence (Cn) of subsets Cn of A by
C0
= A \ A′
Cn+1 = g
 
f[Cn]
!
.
Consider C = 
n∈N
Cn. Then a simple computation shows that
A\C = g
 
B\f[C]
!
. Thus condition (B) implies (A\C) ∼e (B\f[C]). Since (A)
implies C ∼e f[C], it follows that A = (A \ C) ∪C ∼e (B \ f[C]) ∪f[C] = B.
AC as the Culprit
As we have seen above, in ZFC one can prove the existence of rather coun-
terintuitive and undesirable decompositions of balls and other bodies in 3–
dimensional space. Is AC really the culprit or are similar decompositions also
constructible in ZF? Since Lebesgue–measure in R3 is additive, invariant and
normed, the above paradoxes imply that there are bounded subsets of R3 that
are not Lebesgue–measurable. So the fact that there exist models60 of ZF in
which all bounded subsets of R3 are Lebesgue–measurable, shows that here
again AC is the villain.

There are two kinds of truth. To the one kind belong statements
so simple and clear that the opposite assertions obviously could
not be defended. The other kind, the so-called “deep truths”, are
statements in which the opposite also contains deep truth.
Niels Bohr1
6.1 Disasters in Game Theory
The axiom of choice may well be regarded as such a “deep truth”. Its Janus–
faced nature is dramatically revealed by the theory of games. On one hand
AC guarantees the existence of winning strategies for certain deterministic
2–person games with complete information; on the other hand AC allows the
“construction” of similar deterministic 2–person games with complete infor-
mation that lack winning strategies.
Let us start by introducing the relevant concepts via the description of the
following simple games:
Deﬁnition 6.1. The 2–player game
G = G

n, (X1, . . . , Xn), (Y1, . . . Yn), A

where
•
n is a positive integer, the number of moves of each of the two players.
•
(X1, . . . , Xn) (resp. (Y1, . . . , Yn)) is an n–tuple of non–empty sets Xi (resp.
Yi) whose elements are the possible i–th moves of the ﬁrst (resp. second)
player.
•
A is a subset of
n
i=1
(Xi × Yi), called the winning set for the second player.

The game G is played as follows: The players choose successively elements
x1 ∈X1, y1 ∈Y1, x2 ∈X2, . . . , yn ∈Yn
at each step knowing all the previous steps. The 2n–tuple (x1, y1, x2, . . . , yn)
is called the outcome of the game.
The second player wins if the outcome belongs to A; otherwise the ﬁrst
player wins.
A strategy for the ﬁrst player is an n–tuple σ = (σ1, . . . , σn) of functions2
σi :

j<i
(Xj × Yj) →Xi.
A strategy σ is called a winning strategy for the ﬁrst player provided that for
any n–tuple (y1, . . . , yn) ∈
n
i=1
Yi the 2n–tuple (x1, y1, x2, . . . , yn), deﬁned by
x1 = σ(∅) and xi+1 = σ(x1, y1, x2, . . . , yi) for all i = 1, . . . , n −1, does not
belong to A, i.e., that the ﬁrst player wins the game provided that he uses the
strategy σ, no matter what the second player does.
Similarly strategies and winning strategies are deﬁned for the second
player.
The game G is called determinate provided that one of the players has a
winning strategy.
For ﬁnite games of the above form3 all is well:
Theorem 6.2. The game G = G

n, (X1, . . . , Xn), (Y1, . . . , Yn), A

is deter-
minate if all the Xi’s and Yi’s are ﬁnite.
Proof. We proceed by induction.
Step 1: n = 1.
Two cases are possible:
Case 1: There exists x1 ∈X1 with ({x1} × Y1) ∩A = ∅. Then the ﬁrst
player has a winning strategy by choosing such an x1.
Case 2: For each x1 ∈X1 there exists some y1 ∈Y1 with (x1, y1) ∈A.
Since X1 is ﬁnite, there exists a function σ: X1 →Y1 such that
(x, σ(x)) ∈A for each x ∈X. Such σ provides a winning strategy
for the second player.
Step 2: Assume that each game G = G(n, . . .) with n ≤k is determi-
nate. Consider a game G = G(k + 1, (X1, . . . , Xk+1), (Y1, . . . , Yk+1), A).
Then for each pair (x, y) ∈(X1 × Y1) we get a new game G(x, y) =
G

k, (X2, . . . , Xk+1), (Y2, . . . , Yk+1), A(x, y)

, where
2
{∅} is the empty product.

Many familiar deterministic 2–person games with complete information can be
represented in the above form. If ties are possible, like in chess, minor adjust-
ments are needed. See Exercise E 3.

Then two cases are possible:
Case 1: There exists x1 ∈X1 such that for each y ∈Y1 the ﬁrst player
has a winning strategy σ(y) for the game G(x1, y).
Since Y1 is ﬁnite, this implies that the ﬁrst player has a winning
strategy for the original game G.
Case 2: For each x ∈X1 there exists some y ∈Y1 such that the second
player has a winning strategy σ(x, y) for the game G(x, y).
Since X1 × Y1 is ﬁnite, this implies that the second player has a
winning strategy of the original game G.
Problems arise when we pass from ﬁnite to inﬁnite games. There are two
natural ways to do this. We may allow, for each player, ω moves instead of a
ﬁnite number n only or we may allow the players an inﬁnite number of options
for some of their moves, i.e., we may allow the Xi’s and Yi’s to be inﬁnite. In
both cases the games may loose their determinateness:
Disaster 6.3. Inﬁnite games of the form
G

ω, (Xn)n∈ω, (Yn)n∈ω, A

resp. G

n, (Xi)i≤n, (Yi)i≤n, A

may fail to be determinate.
The reasons for the disaster concerning the two types of inﬁnite games
described above are decidedly complementary to each other.
Theorem 6.4. Equivalent are:
1. Each game of the form G

n, (X1, . . . , Xn), (Y1, . . . , Yn), A

is determi-
nate.
2. Each game of the form G

1, (X1), (Y1), A

is determinate.
3. AC.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Obvious.
(2) ⇒(3) Let (Xi)i∈I be a family of non–empty sets. Consider X = 
i∈I
Xi
and A = {(i, x) | i ∈I and x ∈Xi}. Then the game G = G

1, (I), (X), A

is
determinate, by (2). Since for every i ∈I there exists x ∈X with (i, x) ∈A,
the ﬁrst player can have no winning strategy. Thus the second player must
have a winning strategy, i.e., a function σ: I →X such that

i, σ(i)

∈A for
each i ∈I, — in other words: σ ∈
i∈I
Xi. Thus AC holds.
(3) ⇒(1) This implication is veriﬁed as in the proof of Theorem 6.2, since
in the presence of AC the ﬁniteness–assumptions are not needed.

Theorem 6.5. 4 In ZFC there exists a subset A of ({0, 1}2)N such that the
game
GA = (ω, {0, 1}N, {0, 1}N, A) is not determinate.
Proof. 5 Independently of A, each player has at each step precisely 2 options
to play, namely 0 and 1, thus altogether 2ℵ0 options. Since (2ℵ0)ℵ0 = 2ℵ0,
a simple computation shows that each player has — independently of A —
precisely 2ℵ0 possible strategies to play the game. By AC, 2ℵ0 = ℵγ for some
ordinal γ. Thus the possible strategies for the ﬁrst (resp. second) player can
be arranged in the form (σα)α<ℵγ (resp. (τα)α<ℵγ). By transﬁnite recursion
we will construct, for α < ℵγ, subsets Aα and Bα of ({0, 1}2)N such that
1. α < β ⇒(Aα ⊆Aβ and Bα ⊆Bβ),
2. |Aα| ≤|α| and |Bα| ≤α,
3. Aα ∩Bα = ∅,
such that the game GA with A =

α<ℵγ
Aα is not determinate.
Let us assume that the Aα’s and Bα’s are constructed for α < β according
to the above restrictions:
Case 1: β = 0
Choose A0 = B0 = ∅
Case 2: β is a limit ordinal.
Choose Aβ = 
α<β
Aα and Bβ = 
α<β
Bα.
Case 3: β = α + 1 for some α.
If the ﬁrst player plays according to the strategy σα and the second
player plays y = (y1, y2, . . .) for some y ∈{0, 1}N the outcome will
be of the form 0(σα, y) = (x1, y1, x2, y2, . . .). Since |{0, 1}N| =
2ℵ0 and |Bα| < 2ℵ0, there exist some y(σα) in {0, 1}N such that
0

σα, y(σα)

̸∈Bα. Select such an element y(σα) and deﬁne Aβ =
Aα∪{0

σα, y(σα)

}. This implies that σα is not a winning strategy
of the ﬁrst player for the game GAβ, and thus also not for the
original game GA. Similarly there exists some x(τα) in {0, 1}N
such that, if the ﬁrst player plays x(τA) and the second player
plays according to the strategy τα, the outcome 0

x(τα), τα

will
not belong to Aβ. Deﬁne Bβ = Bα ∪

0

x(τα), τα

. This implies
that τα is not a winning strategy of the second player for the game
G({0,1}2)N\Bβ, and thus also not for the game GA. Consequently
the game GA is not determinate.
The Axiom of Determinateness, AD, stating that the above game GA is de-
terminate for each A, will be investigated further in Section 7.2.

ematician will go and do it.
A saying5
In this section will be demonstrated that Lusin’s verdict above is false,
when reformulated as follows:
The proof of the falsity of some statement by means of the Axiom of
Choice is valuable only as an indication that it is useless to waste time
on an exact proof of the statement itself.
In fact, it will be shown that the following statements, each being false
in ZFC, will become true theorems under the assumption that AC is badly
false:
Disaster 7.1. The following statements are false in ZFC:
1. Products of Lindel¨of T2–spaces are Lindel¨of.
2. Finite products of Lindel¨of T1–spaces are Lindel¨of.
3. Lindel¨of T2–spaces are regular.
4. Totally disconnected Lindel¨of T2–spaces are zerodimensional.
Proof. See [Eng89] or the Theorems 7.4, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8 below.
The above failures of the Lindel¨of property to behave nicely are partic-
ularly unfortunate in view of the fact that the Lindel¨of property occupies a
prominent place in ZFC–topology, in particular6
(a) All compact spaces (more generally: all σ–compact spaces7) and all sec-
ond countable spaces in particular, all separable metrizable spaces (more
generally: all separable, paracompact spaces) are Lindel¨of.
(b) All regular Lindel¨of spaces are paracompact and realcompact.
(c) Every locally compact, paracompact space is a sum of locally compact,
Lindel¨of T2–spaces, and vice versa.
(d) For metrizable spaces: Lindel¨of = separable.
(e) Continuous images, closed subspaces and countable sums of Lindel¨of
spaces are Lindel¨of.
As the above observations indicate, the Lindel¨of property behaves almost
as compactness, one of the main diﬀerences being that compactness behaves
much better than the Lindel¨of property with respect to the formation of prod-
ucts.
Here now a big surprise:

7.1 Lindel¨of = Compact
145
Theorem 7.2. 8 Equivalent are:
1. For T1–spaces: Lindel¨of = compact.
2. For subspaces of R: Lindel¨of = compact.
3. CC(R) fails.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Trivial.
(2) ⇒(3) If (2) holds, then N is not Lindel¨of. Thus, by Theorem 3.8,
CC(R) fails.
(3) ⇒(1) We need only show that failure of (1) implies CC(R). So let X
be a non–compact, Lindel¨of T1–space. Let C be an open cover of X that has
no ﬁnite subcover. Since X is Lindel¨of we may assume C to be countable. By
forming ﬁnite unions and deleting superﬂuous members we obtain an open
cover L = {Bn | n ∈N} of X such that
•
Bn ⊆Bm for n ≤m and
•
Cn = (Bn \ 
m<n
Bm) ̸= ∅for each n ∈N.
Deﬁne, for each n ∈N and each x ∈Cn, the set
A(n, x) = Bn \ {x}
and consider the open cover
A = {A(n, x) | n ∈N and x ∈Cn}
of X. Then there exist unique maps α: A →N and β : A →X such that
A = A

α(A), β(A)

for each A ∈A.
Since X is Lindel¨of, A has a countable subcover {An | n ∈N}. The set
M = {α[An] | n ∈N} is an unbounded, thus countable subset of N. For each
m ∈M deﬁne xm = β(Amin{n∈N|α(An)=m}). Then xm ∈Cm. The subspace Y
of X with underlying set {xm | m ∈M} is countable and discrete, since for
each m ∈N
(a) the set {xn | n ≤m} = Bm ∩Y is open in Y ,
(b) the set {xn | n < m} is closed in Y as a ﬁnite subset of a T1–space,
and thus
(c) {xm} is open in Y .
Consequently Y is homeomorphic to the discrete space N. Moreover, each
element x of X is contained in some Bn, and thus has a neighborhood that
meets Y in a ﬁnite set. Hence the T1–property of X implies that Y is closed
in X and thus Lindel¨of (cf. Exercises to Section 3.2, E 1). Consequently N is
Lindel¨of, and Theorem 3.8 implies that CC(R) holds.

Corollary 7.3. 9 Every ZF–model satisﬁes exactly one of the following two
alternatives:
1. Every subspace of R is Lindel¨of.
2. For subspaces of R: Lindel¨of = compact = closed and bounded.
Proof. If CC(R) holds then, by Theorems 4.54, condition (1) holds true.
If CC(R) fails then, by Theorems 7.2 and 4.52, condition (2) holds true.
As pointed out earlier each of the two above cases can occur.
Theorem 7.4. 10 Equivalent are:
1. Products of Lindel¨of T2–spaces are Lindel¨of.
2. PIT holds and CC(R) fails.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Consider the space NR. Let P2R be the set of all subsets of
R with exactly two elements. For D = {a, b} in P2R deﬁne
C(D) = {(nx) ∈NR | na = nb}.
Since R is uncountable, the set C = {C(D) | D ∈P2R} is an open cover
of NR. However C has no countable subcover of NR. To see this, consider a
sequence (Dn) in P2R. Then D = 
n∈N
Dn is at most countable. Thus there
exists an injective map f : D →N. Consequently the point (nx) of NR, deﬁned
by nx =
f(x), if x ∈D
0,
otherwise does not belong to 
n∈N
C(Dn). This fact implies
that NR fails to be Lindel¨of. Thus (1) implies that N fails to be Lindel¨of.
So, by Theorem 3.8, CC(R) fails. Consequently, by Theorem 7.2, the equality
Lindel¨of = compact
holds for T1–spaces and thus in particular for T2–spaces.
So, by (1) products of compact T2–spaces are compact. Thus Theorem 4.70
implies that PIT holds.
(2) ⇒(1) If CC(R) fails, Theorem 7.2 implies, as above, that Lindel¨of =
compact for T2–spaces. Thus PIT implies, via Theorem 4.70, that products
of Lindel¨of T2–spaces are Lindel¨of.
Remark 7.5. 11
1. Observe that there exist models12 of ZF in which PIT holds but CC(R)
fails. Thus in these models the theorem
Products of Lindel¨of T2–spaces are Lindel¨of
holds true. Since the Lindel¨of–property is closed–hereditary (cf. Exercises
to Section 3.2, E 1), in the above models the Lindel¨of T2–spaces form an

7.1 Lindel¨of = Compact
147
epireﬂective subcategory, i.e., — besides a TychonoﬀTheorem — there
is also a ˇCech–Stone Theorem for Lindel¨of spaces. In particular, in these
models, the familiar ˇCech–Stone compactiﬁcation N →βN of N is the
Lindel¨of–T2–reﬂection of N — somewhat surprising, perhaps.
2. Note further that there is no model of ZF in which products of Lindel¨of
T1–spaces are always Lindel¨of. This can be seen as follows: By Theorem
7.4, in such a model CC(R) must fail and products of compact T1–spaces
must be compact. Hence (see Exercises to Section 4.8, E 11) AC must
hold. But if AC holds, then CC(R) cannot fail, a contradiction.
The situation is even worse for T0–spaces. See Exercise E 2.
What about ﬁnite products?
Theorem 7.6. Equivalent are:
1. Finite products of Lindel¨of T1–spaces are Lindel¨of.
2. CC(R) fails.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Consider the Sorgenfrey line S = (R, σ), i.e., the topological
space that has R as underlying set and the collection of all intervals of the
form
[a, b) = {x ∈R | a ≤x < b}
as a base for the topology σ. Then σ is ﬁner than the canonical topology τ on
R. In particular S is a T1–space. Moreover, the space S2 fails to be Lindel¨of,
since the uncountable open cover C = {C} ∪{Ca | a ∈R} of S2, where
C = {(x, y) ∈R2 | x + y < 0} and Ca = {(x, y) ∈R2 | a ≤x and −a ≤y},
contains no proper subcover of S2. (Draw a picture to see this.) Thus, by (1),
S is not Lindel¨of. To show that (2) holds it suﬃces to demonstrate that under
CC(R) S is Lindel¨of. For this purpose we will show ﬁrst that:
(A)
|σ| ≤|R|
Since (R, τ) is second countable it follows immediately that
(B)
|τ| ≤2ℵ0.
Moreover the set D of all at most countable subsets of R satisﬁes
(C)
|D| ≤|RN| = |R|N = (2ℵ0)ℵ0 = 2ℵ2
0 = 2ℵ0.
Every A ∈σ can be decomposed in the form
A = intτA∪(A\intτA), where A\intτA is easily seen to be at most countable.
Thus (B) and (C) imply:
|σ| ≤|τ| · |D| ≤2ℵ0 · 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ0+ℵ0 = 2ℵ0 = |R|.
Hence (A) holds. This fact implies, via CC(R), that:
CC(σ) : 
n∈N
Un ̸= ∅
for every sequence of non–empty subsets Un of σ.
Finally let us consider an open cover U of S. Then W = {intτU | U ∈U}
is an open cover of the open subspace X =  W of (R, τ). Since X is second
countable, Theorem 4.54 implies that there exists a subset {Vn | n ∈N}

148
7 Beauty without Choice
of W that covers X. By CC(σ) there exists a sequence (Un)n∈N in U with
Vn = intτUn for each n ∈N. Again it is easily seen that R \ X is at most
countable. Thus, by CC(σ), there exists a subset {Wn | n ∈N} of U that
covers R \ X. Consequently {Un | n ∈N} ∪{Wn | n ∈N} is an at most
countable subcover of U. Thus S is a Lindel¨of space.
(2) ⇒(1) Immediate from Theorem 7.2 and the fact that ﬁnite products
of compact spaces are compact (see Exercises to Section 4.8, E 1).
Theorem 7.7. Equivalent are:
1. Every Lindel¨of T2–space is paracompact.
2. Every Lindel¨of T2–space is normal.
3. Every Lindel¨of T2–space is regular.
4. CC(R) fails.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) ⇒(3) Immediate.
(3) ⇒(4) Enrich the canonical topology τ of the reals by adding the set
B = R \ { 1
n | n ∈N+} as an open set, i.e., by considering the topology σ
generated by τ ∪{B}. Then the space (R, σ) is a non–regular T2–space. Thus,
by (3), (R, σ) fails to be Lindel¨of. Since (R, σ) is second countable, Theorem
4.54, implies that CC(R) fails.
(4) ⇒(1) By Theorem 7.2, (4) implies that Lindel¨of T2–spaces are com-
pact, thus paracompact.
Theorem 7.8. 13 Equivalent are:
1. Every totally disconnected Lindel¨of T2–space is zerodimensional.
2. CC(R) fails.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Consider the topological space (X, τ), whose underlying set
is deﬁned by
X = {(xn) ∈QN |

n∈N
x2
n < ∞}
and whose topology τ is induced by the metric d, deﬁned by
d

(xn), (yn)

=
(
n∈N
(xn −yn)2.
Then (X, τ) is easily seen to be a totally disconnected, second countable T2–
space. However, (X, τ) fails to be zerodimensional. To see this, consider the
point x = (0, 0, 0, . . .) and its neighborhood
U = {y ∈X | d(x, y) < 1}.
We will show that there is no clopen neighborhood V of x with V ⊆U. Let
V be a neighborhood of x with V ⊆U. Via recursion we will construct an

7.1 Lindel¨of = Compact

element x = (xn) of X with the following property:
(P)
∀n∈N yn = (x0, x1, . . . , xn, 0, 0, . . .) ∈V and dist(yn, X \ V ) <
1
2n
as follows:
1. x0 = 0
2. Let (x0, . . . , xn) be deﬁned such that the corresponding point yn =
(x0, . . . , xn, 0, 0, . . .) satisﬁes condition P. Deﬁne xn+1 to be the small-
est element of the set, consisting of all fractions
m
2n+1 such that:
a) m ∈{0, 1, . . . , 2n+1}.
b) (x0, . . . , xn,
m
2n+1 , 0, 0, . . .) ∈V .
c) (x0, . . . , xn, m+1
2n+1 , 0, 0, . . .) ̸∈V .
Then x is an element of X that belongs to the closure of V and to the closure
of (X \ V ). Thus V is not clopen.
By (1), the above implies that (X, τ) is not Lindel¨of. Thus, by Theorem
4.54, CC(R) fails.
(2) ⇒(1) If CC(R) fails then, by Theorem 7.2, every totally disconnected
Lindel¨of T2–space is compact and thus zerodimensional.
Exercises to Section 7.1:
E 1. 14 Show the equivalence of the following statements:
(1) All σ–compact spaces, (i.e., spaces that are countable unions of com-
pact spaces) are Lindel¨of.

A ⊆N is open in Nl iﬀm ≤n ∈A implies m ∈A). Show that

l fails to be Lindel¨of.

7.2 Measurability (The Axiom of Determinateness)
Why were set theorists so drawn to study this ax-
iom [of determinateness], drawn, in fact, to the point
where it became the key area of research for all but a
few of the best in the ﬁeld?
E.M. Kleinberg18
If a model of ZF satisﬁes AD, then this model is
closer to physical reality than any model of ZFC.
For example, the Banach–Tarski paradoxical decom-
position of a ball is impossible.
V.W. Marek and J. Mycielski19
Among all alternatives to the axiom of choice AC
the axiom of determinateness AD undoubtedly is the
most interesting.
U. Felgner and K. Schulz20
As we have seen in previous sections the Axiom of Choice is not only
responsible for some beautiful theorems but also for the creation of some
unwelcome monsters, like non–measurable sets of reals. “It was felt that these
choice–generated oddities should not appear among the simpler sets, that they
should probably not be deﬁnable at all.”21
In 1962 Mycielski and Steinhaus22 introduced a new axiom, the Axiom of
Determinateness, AD, which stipulated that certain inﬁnite, deterministic
2–person games with complete information (cf. Section 6.1) are determinate,
i.e., that one of the players has a winning strategy. The authors did not claim
this new axiom to be intuitively true, but stated that the purpose of their
paper is “only to propose another theory which seems very interesting although
its consistency is problematic.”23 The consistency problem (i.e., the question
whether ZF + AD is consistent, provided ZF is) is still unsettled24. But set
theorists are fairly convinced that AD is relatively consistent. In fact they
have shown that ZF + AD is consistent iﬀZFC and the assumption that
inﬁnitely many Woodin cardinals exist, is consistent; and the existence of such
large cardinals is one of set theorists’ pet beliefs. Though AD is incompatible

with AC, as Theorem 6.5 shows, its consequences are amazing. There are
highly desirable results, e.g., the theorem that all sets of real numbers are
Lebesgue–measurable. Moreover, there are deep and surprising connections
between determinateness of games and the theory of large cardinals. It is
the “richness and internal harmony of these consequences”25 that caused the
axiom of determinateness “to have an extraordinary impact on modern set
theory”26 and has led to a “very rich and intriguing theory.”27 Naturally, this
theory cannot be presented here. We restrict our attention to outlining the
basics and stating some of the consequences without proofs.
Deﬁnition 7.9. Let X be a non–empty set and A a subset of XN. The game
G(X, A) is played as follows:
Two players choose alternately consecutive elements x0, x1, x2, . . . in X,
such that each player knows, (besides X and A), whenever it is his term, the
tuple of previously choosen elements. The ﬁrst player (i.e., the one choosing
x0, x2, x4, . . .) wins if the resulting sequence (xn) belongs to A. Otherwise the
second player (i.e., the one choosing x1, x3, x5, . . .) wins.
The game G(X, A) is called determinate provided that one of the players
has a winning strategy (see Deﬁnition 6.1).
Recall that 2 = {0, 1}.
Deﬁnition 7.10. Let A be a subset of the unit interval [0, 1]. The game G(A)
is played the same way as the game G(2, A). However, the ﬁrst player wins if

n∈N
xn
2n+1 ∈A. Otherwise the second player wins.
The game G(A) is determinate provided that one of the players has a
winning strategy.
Proposition 7.11. 28 Equivalent are:
1. For each subset A of NN, the game G(N, A) is determinate.
2. For each subset A of 2N, the game G(2, A) is determinate.
3. For each subset A of [0, 1], the game G(A) is determinate.
Proof. (1) ⇒(2) Let A be a subset of 2N. Deﬁne
B = {(xn) ∈NN | (xn) ∈A or ∃n x2n+1 ̸∈2}. Then — for either player — a
winning strategy for the game G(N, B) provides easily a wining strategy for
G(2, A).
(2) ⇒(3) Let A be a subset of [0, 1]. Consider the map f : 2N →[0, 1],
deﬁned by f(xn) = 
n∈N
xn
2n+1 . Then — for either player — a winning strategy
for the game G(2, f −1[A]) is a winning strategy for G(A).

(3) ⇒(2) Since the map f, deﬁned above, is not injective, we need to
apply a small trick. Let A be a subset of 2N. Consider the set M = {(xn) ∈
2N | ∀n x6n = 0 and x6n+3 = 1}. Then the map g: M →2N, deﬁned by
g

(xn

= (yn) with
 y2n
= x3n+1
y2n+1 = x3n+2

,
is a bijection. Consider the set
B = g−1[A] ∪{(xn) ∈2N | (xn) is not ﬁnally constant and
∃m ∀k ≤m x6k = x6m+3 = 0}.
As can be seen easily, determinateness of the game G(2, B) implies deter-
minateness of the original game G(2, A). So it suﬃces to verify the former.
This follows immediately from the fact that B is saturated with respect to
the map f : 2N →[0, 1] deﬁned above (i.e., from the equation f −1[f[B]] = B)
and the fact that, by (2), the game G(f(B)) is determinate.
(2) ⇒(1) Let A be a subset of NN. Consider the following partition
{X, Y, Z} of 2N:
X = {(xn) ∈2N | {n ∈N | x2n = 0} is ﬁnite},
Y = {(xn) ∈(2N \ X) | {n ∈N | x2n+1 = 0} is ﬁnite},
Z = 2N \ (X ∪Y ).
Consider further the bijection g: Z →NN, deﬁned as follows:
y0 = min{k ∈N | x2k = 0}, i.e., y0 is the number of consecutive choices
of 1’s by the ﬁrst player at the beginning of the game.
y1 = min{k ∈N | x2y0+2k+1 = 0}, i.e., y1 is the number of consecutive
choices of 1’s by the second player after the ﬁrst choice of 0 by
the ﬁrst player.
y2 = min{k ∈N | x2y0+2y1+2(k+1) = 0},
etc.
Deﬁne B = (g−1[A] ∪Y ) \ X. Then it is seen easily that — for either player
— a winning strategy for the game G(2, B) provides a winning strategy for
the game G(N, A).
Deﬁnition 7.12. AD, the Axiom of Determinateness, states that the equiv-
alent conditions of the preceding proposition are satisﬁed.
An impressive consequence of the Axiom of Determinateness is the follow-
ing result that we present without proof:
Theorem 7.13. 29 Under AD every subset of R is Lebesgue–measurable.
The above results indicates that Lebesgue measure for subsets of R is
better behaved under AD than under AC. However, it is known that in ZF
Lebesgue measure may fail to be σ–additive. So immediately the question
pops up whether by gaining something (the measurability of all subsets of R)
one looses something else (the σ–additivity of Lebesgue measure). Fortunately
this is not so:
29
[MySw64]. For improved proofs see, e.g., [Jec73], [Kle77] or [Mar2003].

7.2 Measurability (The Axiom of Determinateness)
153
Proposition 7.14. 30 Under AD Lebesgue measure is σ–additive.
Proof. The familiar proof of σ–additivity of the Lebesgue measure uses, in
several places, the following weak choice principle, where τ denotes the topol-
ogy of Rn:
CC(τ): For each sequence (Xn) of non–empty subsets Xn of τ, the product

n∈N
Xn is not empty.
The fact that τ has a countable base immediately implies |τ| = 2ℵ0 = |R|.
Thus CC(τ) is equivalent to CC(R). Thus CC(τ), and hence the σ–additivity
of Lebesgue measure follows from AD via the next proposition.
Proposition 7.15. 31 Under AD
1. CC(R) holds,
2. AC(R) fails.
Proof. (1) Consider M = {2n + 1 | n ∈N}. Then |NM| = 2ℵ0 = |R| implies
that it suﬃces to show that 
n∈N
An ̸= ∅for each sequence (An) of non–empty
subsets An of NM. Consider the game G(N, A), where A = {(xn) ∈NN | ∀n ∈
N (x2n+1) ̸∈Ax0}. Since the sets An are non–empty the ﬁrst player has no
winning strategy. Thus, by AD, the second player has a winning strategy.
This provides him with a function that associates with each strategy σm of
the ﬁrst player, of the form play “x0 = m and x2n = 0 for n ≥1”, a sequence
sm = (x2n+1) in Am. Thus (sm) ∈
m∈N
Am.
(2) In Theorem 6.5 it has been shown that AC implies the existence of a
subset A of 2N such that the game G(2, A) is not determinate. A straightfor-
ward analysis of the proof reveals that only AC(R) is needed. Thus AC(R)
implies the failure of AD. By contraposition AD implies the failure of AC(R).
An alternative proof can be obtained by means of theorem 7.13 via the con-
struction 5.7 of non–measurable Vitali Monster.
Proposition 7.16. 32 Under AD there is no free ultraﬁlter on N.
Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 7.13 via the construction 5.9
of non–measurable Sierpi´nski Monsters by means of WUT(N).

Corollary 7.17. Under AD the discrete space of natural numbers is ultra-
ﬁlter–compact and Tychonoﬀ–compact.
Proof. Immediate from Proposition 7.16 and Theorem 3.32(2).
Proposition 7.18. Under AD all solutions of the Cauchy–equation are con-
tinuous.
Proof. Immediate from Theorems 7.13 and 5.5 in view of Exercises to Section
5.1, E 7.
Corollary 7.19. 33 Under AD the additive group R has no non–trivial direct
summand.
Proof. Assume that R can be expressed as a direct sum A⊕B of two non–zero
subgroups. Then the map f : R →R, deﬁned by f(a + b) = a for a ∈A and
b = B, is a non–continuous solution of the equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y),
contradicting Proposition 7.18.
Corollary 7.20. 34 Under AD, R considered as vector space over the ﬁeld Q
has no basis.
Proof. If B would be a basis of the vector space R over Q, then for any b ∈B
the set Q · b = {r · b | r ∈Q} would be a non–trivial direct summand of the
additive group of R, contradicting Corollary 7.19.

alence relation on X, deﬁned by

Under AD the following hold:
1. There exists a family (Fi)i∈I of 2–element subsets Fi of K with 
i∈I
Fi = ∅.
2. K is not linearly orderable.
3. |R| < |K| and |K| <∗|R|.

for each x in X, its equivalence class with respect to ϱ by [x]ϱ. Then the

of 2–element subsets of K, considered as family
indexed by itself, has an empty product, since otherwise (see Exercises to
Section 5.1, E 1) there would exist a non–measurable subset of R, contradicting
Theorem 7.13.
(2) Immediate from (1) and Exercises to Section 1.1, E 2 (8).
(3) Observe ﬁrst that |K| ̸= |R|, since R is linearly orderable but, by (2), K
fails to be linearly orderable. Observe next that |K| ≤∗|R|, since there exists
a bijection b: R →X, and a surjection p: X →K, deﬁned by p(x) = [x]ϱ.
Thus it remains to be shown that |R| ≤|K|. Here the crucial observation,
due to Sierpi´nski36, is the fact that the function f : (0, 1) →P(N2), deﬁned
by f(x) = {

n, int(n · x)

| n ∈N}, where
int(a) = max{n ∈N | n ≤a},
has the following property:
(•)
If x ̸= y, then f(x) ∩f(y) is ﬁnite.
To see this, let x and y be diﬀerent elements of (0, 1), and let

n, int(nx)

=

m, int(my)

be an element of f(x)∩f(y). Then n = m and int(nx) = int(ny).
The latter implies |nx −ny |< 1 and thus n <
1
|x−y|. Thus f(x) ∩f(y) has
at most int

1
|x−y|

members. Let g: R →(0, 1) and h: N2 →N be arbitrary
bijections and let χ: P(N) →X be the map associating with any A ⊆N its
characteristic function χA. Then the map k = χ ◦P(h) ◦f ◦g: R →X has
the property (•) and thus the map p ◦k: R →K is injective.
Finally, let us mention without proof the following remarkable results con-
cerning the Continuum Hypothesis.
Theorem 7.22. 37 Under AC the following hold:
1. 2ℵ0 and ℵ1 are w.r.t. ≤incomparable minimal successors of ℵ0. Thus
•
CH, the Continuum Hypothesis, holds.
•
AH(0), the Special Aleph–Hypothesis, fails.
2. ℵ0 <∗ℵ1 <∗2ℵ0.
Thus, w.r.t. ≤∗the Continuum Hypothesis fails.
3. W.r.t. ≤there are at least 3 cardinals between 2ℵ0 and 2(2ℵ0):
2ℵ0 < (2ℵ0 + ℵ1) < 2ℵ1 < (2ℵ1 + |K|) < 2(2ℵ0)
(where K is deﬁned in Theorem 7.21).

Appendix: Models
In the main text several ZF–models and some of their properties have been
mentioned. In this Appendix we illustrate properties of some of these models
by means of diagrams, where for a model M
•
P
means that M has property P.
•
P
means that M fails to satisfy P.
•
P
means that we do not know whether M satisﬁes P.
Most of the data presented here are taken from [HoRu98] where these and
many other models are described and analyzed most thoroughly and in great
detail.
A.1 AD and DC
Though no models for AD have been constructed so far, it is known40
that if there exists a ZF–model that satisﬁes AD, then there also exists
a ZF–model that satisﬁes AD and DC. For properties of any such model
see Diagram A.1.
Note in particular that DC ensures the validity of
•
most results from elementary analysis (Section 4.6),
•
σ–additivity of Lebesgue–measure (Exercises to Section 5.1, E 13 resp.
Proposition 7.14),
•
the Baire Category Theorem for complete metric and for compact
Hausdorﬀspaces (Theorem 4.106).
Moreover, AD implies that
•
all subsets of R (resp. of Rn) are Lebesgue–measurable (Theorem 7.13),
•
all real solutions of the Cauchy–equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) are
continuous (Proposition 7.18),
•
no paradoxical decompositions exist (Section 5.2).
On the other hand:
40
see [Kec84]

160
Appendix
•
WUF(N) fails (Proposition 7.16), hence
–
the discrete space N is ultraﬁlter–compact and Tychonoﬀcompact
(Theorem 3.32),
–
the Baire Category Theorem fails for ultraﬁlter–compact T3–spaces
(Theorem 4.108).
•
PIT fails, thus
–
the TychonoﬀTheorem fails even for Cantor cubes 2I (Theorem
4.70); moreover 2R fails to be Weierstrass–compact (Exercises to
Section 7.2, E 8),
–
the Ascoli Theorem fails (Theorem 4.91).
•
AC(2) fails (Exercises to Section 5.1, E 1), thus
–
for every natural number n ≥2 there exists a graph that fails to
be n–colorable, though each of its ﬁnite subgraphs is n–colorable
(Theorems 4.113 and 4.115),
–
R, considered as a vector space over Q, has no basis (Proof of
Disaster 5.2 (2)).
–
The Adjoint Functor Theorem fails (Theorem 4.51).
Finally, since AC fails but WUF(?) holds:
•
The TychonoﬀTheorem fails even for ultraﬁlter–compact spaces (The-
orem 4.80).
A.2 Shelah’s Second Model41
In this model, DC holds and any subset of R is Lebesgue–measurable. As
Diagram A.2 shows this model shares many of the features of A.1–models.
A.3 Howard–Rubin’s First Model42
In this model, AC(R), CC, and PIT hold, but DC and KW fail. See
Diagram A.3. Note in particular that here:
•
Most results from elementary analysis are valid (Section 4.6)
•
The TychonoﬀTheorem holds for Hausdorﬀspaces (Theorem 4.70),
and for countable products (Exercises to Section 4.8, E 4), but not in
full generality (Theorem 4.68).
•
The ˇCech–Stone Theorem holds (Theorems 3.22 and 4.8).
•
The Ascoli Theorem holds (Theorem 4.91).
•
The Baire Category Theorem holds for totally bounded or second
countable complete metric spaces (Theorem 4.104) and for countable
products of compact metric spaces (Theorem 4.105), but fails for com-
plete metric spaces and for compact Hausdorﬀspaces (Theorem 4.106).
•
The Hahn–Banach–Theorem holds (Diagram 5.25).
•
Every open lattice has a maximal ﬁlter (Theorem 4.36), but not every
closed lattice has a maximal ﬁlter (Theorem 4.32).
41
M 38 in [HoRu98]. A similar model has been constructed earlier by Solovay
[Sol65]. These constructions assume that in some ZF–models, inaccessible car-
dinals exist.
42
N 38 in [HoRu98].

Appendix
161
•
For every n, a graph is n–colorable provided that each of its ﬁnite sub-
graphs is n–colorable (Theorems 4.113, 4.115 and Exercises to Section
4.11, E 4).
•
Countable sums of normal spaces are normal (Theorem 4.66); however
there exists an orderable space that is a sum of normal spaces but fails
to be normal itself (Exercises to Section 4.7, E 5).
A.4 Cohen’s First Model43
In this model PIT holds, but Fin(R) and thus CC(R) fail. See Diagram
A.4.
Note in particular that here:
•
Lindel¨of = compact for T1–spaces (Theorem 7.2).
•
Finite products of Lindel¨of T1–spaces are Lindel¨of (Theorem 7.6).
•
Arbitrary products of Lindel¨of T2–spaces are Lindel¨of (Theorem 7.4).
•
The ˇCech–Stone Theorem for Lindel¨of spaces holds: Lindel¨of T2–spaces
form an epireﬂective subcategory of the category of T2–spaces (Remark
7.5).
•
Lindel¨of T2–spaces are normal (Theorem 7.7).
•
Totally disconnected Lindel¨of T2–spaces are zerodimensional (Theo-
rem 7.8).
Moreover, due to PIT alone:
•
The TychonoﬀTheorem holds for Hausdorﬀspaces (Theorem 4.70).
•
The ˇCech–Stone Theorem holds (Theorems 3.22 and 4.8).
•
The Hahn–Banach theorem holds (Diagram 5.25).
•
Every open lattice has a maximal ﬁlter (Theorem 4.36).
•
For every n a graph is n–colorable provided each of its ﬁnite subgraphs
is n–colorable (Theorems 4.113, 4.115, and Exercises to Section 4.11,
E 4).
However, since Fin(R) fails:
•
Many results in elementary analysis fail (Section 4.6).
•
[0, 1] fails to be Alexandroﬀ–Urysohn compact (Theorem 3.32).
•
There exist inﬁnite subsets of R without any decreasing or increasing
sequences (Disaster 4.25).
A.5 Fraenkel’s Second Model44
In this model AC(R) holds, but AC(2), CC(2), and even PCC(2) fail.
See Diagram A.5.
Observe in particular that here
•
The discrete space N is Lindel¨of, but the sum of N with a suitable
compact T2–space fails to be Lindel¨of (Remark 4.63).
•
A countable union of pairwise disjoint 2–element sets can fail to be
countable, even D–inﬁnite (Proposition 3.6).
•
D–ﬁnite unions of D–ﬁnite sets can be D–inﬁnite (Disaster 4.3).
43
M1 in [HoRu98].
44
N2(2) in [HoRu98].

162
Appendix
•
Images of D–ﬁnite sets can be D–inﬁnite (Disaster 4.3).
•
The power set of a D–ﬁnite set can be D–inﬁnite (Disaster 4.3).
•
Countable products of 3–element spaces can fail to be compact (The-
orem 4.77) or Baire (Exercises to Section 4.10, E 10).
A.6 Pincus–Solovay’s First Model45
In this model there are no free ultraﬁlters (i.e., WUF(?) fails), but DC
holds. See Diagram A.6.
So here:
•
The TychonoﬀTheorem holds for ultraﬁlter–compact spaces (Theorem
4.80),
and for countable products of compact spaces (Proposition 4.72),
but fails for compact Hausdorﬀspaces (Theorem 4.70).
•
The Ascoli Theorem fails (Theorem 4.91).
•
The Baire Category Theorem holds for complete metric and for
compact Hausdorﬀspaces (Theorem 4.106), but fails for ultraﬁlter–
compact T3–spaces (Theorem 4.108).
A.7 Fraenkel’s First Model46
In this model, there exist amorphous sets. See Exercises to Section 4.1, E
11; Section 4.3, E 4 and Section 4.10, E 11.
A.8 Feferman–Levy Model47
In this model, R is the countable union of countable sets.
Consequently here:
•
R is a sequential space (Proposition 4.57).
•
R is neither Fr´echet nor Lindel¨of (Theorem 4.54).
•
Lebesgue measure fails to be σ–additive (Exercises to Section 5.1, E
13).
A.9 Howard–Rubin’s Second Model48
In this model, AC(R), DC and PIT hold, but KW fails.

46
N1 in [HoRu98].
47
M9 in [HoRu98].
