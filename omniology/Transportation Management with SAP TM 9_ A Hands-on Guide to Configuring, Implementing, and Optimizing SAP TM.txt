Introduction
Globalization has played a crucial role in the expansion of supply chains across countries and continents into  
ever-changing worldwide networks. Manufacturers, driven by the desire to produce cost-efective, high-quality 
products are continuing to extend their supply-demand chains, introducing new challenges to these networks. 
his seismic shift has lead to the phasing out of internal logistics functions, and a move towards third-party logistics 
providers (3PLs), enabling manufacturers to focus on their core business areas. 3PLs are challenged daily by 
demanding customers, changing regulations, compliance standards, and gaps between their information  
technology (IT) maturity and customers’ expectations. Hence, 3PLs have started to simplify, modernize, and 
standardize their IT systems. he aim is to build a system landscape that can address all of their requirements, while 
replacing most of the existing complex and fragmented systems with a robust platform. In particular, applications 
that deal with critical functional areas, such as order management, transportation planning, execution, warehousing, 
inance, billing, and pricing and costing are in need of attention. TMS (transportation management systems) has 
therefore emerged as one of the critical areas, if not the most critical one.
Implementation of a TMS is key. If executed well, a good TMS can deliver many beneits to an organization in 
terms of optimization, improved eiciency, reduced errors, and increased revenue. However, a number of projects 
fail to achieve these objectives for a host of reasons, including incorrect product selection, overcustomization of the 
system, lack of standardized processes, and little support from management. In realizing the maximum beneit from a 
TMS, the product selection process and implementation methodology play signiicant roles. 
his book provides insights intended to make the SAP Transportation Management (SAP TM) journey more 
relevant and fruitful. With a proven evaluation framework and solid recommendations, the book is useful for 
executives, pre-sales teams, and implementation and rollout teams. Furthermore, it can help decision makers, such as 
chief intelligence oicers (CIOs) and chief experience oicers (CXOs), with the important tasks of selecting a product, 
creating a business case for management approval, and designing a future road map for the organization. Combining 
the results of research and analysis and knowledge gained from experience working with industry leaders, the book 
helps to advance the understanding of SAP TM, and it serves as a step-by-step implementation and rollout guide.

CHAPTER 1
Transportation Industry Overview: 
3PL Perspective
In this chapter, we will discuss the following:
How the third-party logistics provider (3PL) industry evolved
•฀
Services offered by 3PLs
•฀
Expectations of 3PLs’ customers in terms of technology and service offerings
•฀
The way forward
•฀
A few decades ago, it was normal practice for freight owners (manufacturers/shippers) to deliver their products 
to wholesalers and retailers using their own in-house fleet of vehicles. Often, products did not reach customers 
on time, owing to the unavailability of these vehicles, resulting in loss of opportunity and revenue, not to mention 
customer dissatisfaction. When manufacturers/shippers started selling their goods internationally, this issue became 
more serious. During this time, many organizations engaged local road carriers owning one or two trucks/trailers to 
supplement the work of their fleet. They discovered that such outsourcing was cost-effective and flexible and allowed 
them to be free of capital investment and the hassle of maintaining aging assets. Soon, using hired or contracted 
vehicles became a universally accepted method of inland transport. Furthermore, freight owners instituted use of 
long-term contracts with these types of carriers to avoid any uncertainty regarding services and transportation costs. 
Carriers owning one or two vehicles increased their fleet sizes and introduced different vehicle types to qualify for 
these long-term contracts that awarded them a committed volume of business. 
As international trade flourished, products began crossing borders. Manufacturers/shippers recruited 
professionals with import/export and international ocean and airfreight-forwarding experience to manage the 
movement of their products. To obtain customs clearance, contact and book carriers, provide documentation, and 
handle the various legal aspects of international shipping, a team of tens to hundreds was required, depending on 
the size of the business and the location and nature of the freight. Yet, setting up transportation on other continents 
remained a major challenge. The unpredictable increase in business on some trade lanes and the laws of the 
importing country added to the complexity of the transportation business. 
Globalization forced manufacturers/shippers and retailers to produce products that were cost-effective but high 
quality. Many well-known and established brands were being challenged by new brands in terms of lower customer 
prices because the new brands had operation costs comparatively lower than those of their competitors. All aspects 
of cost contribution that were increasing expenditures in the supply chain were analyzed. Extended supply chains, 
reduced inventories, shortened product life cycles, and increased freight cost and handling charges were a few  
factors leading to an increase in the cost of supply chain operations. Outsourced logistics was a new idea that emerged 
during this time. Manufacturers/shippers started focusing on their core areas, while transferring logistics functions  
to outsourced 3PLs.

CHAPTER 1 ■ TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY OVERVIEW: 3PL PERSPECTIVE

As 3PLs took on these new clients, the greater freight and handling costs compelled the 3PLs to venture into 
organizing transportation activities, such as: 
Consolidation of small freight with freight from other manufacturers/shippers to build volume 
•฀
and thereby get better rates from air and ocean carriers
Customs clearance
•฀
Rate negotiation with inland carriers
•฀
Carrying out part of the documentation
•฀
Arranging for temporary storage of freight
•฀
Initially, manufacturers/shippers watchfully assigned 3PLs a relatively limited number of services, such as 
transportation needs and managing warehouses, but subsequently started employing 3PLs to do more. In this way, 
3PLs gained experience and expertise in delivering core and associated services, thereby gaining customers’ confidence.
Manufacturers/shippers that chose not to use 3PLs at that time did so for the following reasons:
Logistics operation requires core competency and hence cannot be outsourced; furthermore,  
•฀
meeting level of service was perceived as a risk.
Outsourcing was not seen as cost saving.
•฀
Logistics experts in their organization did not want to lose their importance and control.
•฀
Difficulty of integrating the organization’s Internet technology (IT) systems with those of  
•฀
the 3PL.
Freight security was their concern.
•฀
Inhibition of relationships with 3PLs.
•฀
Insufficient geographical coverage of 3PLs.
•฀
Bitter experience in the past.
•฀
During the initial phases, 3PLs offered a maximum of two types of service, such that the manufacturer/shipper 
might get only trucking, only customs clearance, or only warehousing and rate negotiation with carriers. Geographical 
coverage was also limited. 3PLs were mostly local, proprietary firms with small teams. However, the demands of 
the manufacturing/shipping community and growing world trade soon created longer and more complex supply 
chains and their associated logistics processes. To address this demand, 3PLs began to partner with other logistics 
companies in different countries, with specialization and expertise. These arrangements gave the 3PLs time to 
establish themselves. However, differences in culture, level of development, and technology were major impediments 
in such relationships. 3PL industry leaders started phasing out these business relationships by opening their own 
offices in some countries. Moreover, increasingly global manufacturers/shippers wanted a single point of contact for 
their outsourced logistics. Large and global manufacturers/shippers were often looking for large, financially stable 
3PLs that could provide all services and wider geographic coverage. Geographic and portfolio expansion, therefore, 
remained a priority for 3PLs. Large 3PLs began exploring opportunities to acquire partners where the 3PLs did not 
have a presence. The period 1996–2006 witnessed major acquisitions and mergers.
After a set of initial hiccups, parent 3PLs and acquired 3PLs started working together as a single company. 
Standardizing the process across the organization would remain a major challenge for many years. Business-process 
mapping, analysis, and automation helped achieve some movement toward standardization. Training helped 
standardize organizations further. Incorporating local requirements and ways of working into standard, global 
processes was a Herculean task. Today, most leading 3PLs have documentation regarding their processes. However, 
technology consolidation has continued to be a major problem area. 3PLs use different applications, most of which 
are homegrown. These applications not only have scalability and integration issues, but also are functionally poor. 
3PLs are working on rationalizing their technology landscape to reduce the gap in IT expectation experienced by

CHAPTER 1 ■ TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY OVERVIEW: 3PL PERSPECTIVE
3
their customers, something that is being discussed in every logistics forum. Some 3PLs are looking at their technology 
landscape holistically, but in most cases, it is still project focused and more tactical. Manufacturers/Shippers want 
3PLs to offer comprehensive and easily integrated solutions; to do so, 3PLs need to have a clearer picture of the 
manufacturer/shipper supply chain. A collaborative approach between manufacturer/shipper and 3PL remains the 
only way to improve manufacturer/shipper satisfaction with the 3PL’s IT capabilities and the relationship between 
manufacturer/shipper and 3PL. Today, most manufacturers/shippers believe that their 3PLs should have the 
following execution-oriented enablers and tools:
Network modeling and optimization
•฀
Order management
•฀
Collaboration portals for booking, tracking, and payment
•฀
Collaboration tools (SharePoint, Lotus Notes, video conferencing, and so on)
•฀
Electronic data interchange (orders, advance shipment notices, invoicing)
•฀
Transportation management: planning, sourcing, and execution
•฀
Yard management
•฀
Warehouse management
•฀
Event management and track and trace
•฀
Supply chain event management
•฀
Bar coding
•฀
Radio frequency identification (RFID)
•฀
Global trade management tools
•฀
Advanced analytics and data-mining tools 
•฀
The large 3PLs are expanding their portfolio and coverage. There are more than a dozen organizations globally, 
with annual turnover in excess of five billion dollars. The revenue of the 3PL industry has been growing continuously 
as a result of more and more manufacturers/shippers’ opting for outsourcing rather than insourcing. Furthermore, 
manufacturers/shippers are also considering a reduction in the number of 3PLs engaged by them.
3PLs are major employers in many countries. 3PLs have been elevated to partner status, which essentially means 
that they have exceeded their customers’ expectations. These 3PLs have visibility in the manufacturer/shipper supply 
chain, which helps them forecast and plan their resources/operations more effectively and offer cost advantage and 
superior service to their customers. Moreover, 3PLs play an important role in network planning and streamlining 
supply chain operation. Manufacturers/Shippers are satisfied with the updated information shared by 3PLs and 
regard these companies as sufficiently agile and flexible. Manufacturers/Shippers largely view these relationships as 
successful and have gained incremental benefits yearly.
Having spent time with many industries, in diverse locales, and experienced complexity in the supply chain, 3PLs 
forecasted a huge demand for their services. 3PLs learned, adopted, and built offerings that help manufacturers/shippers 
reduce their logistics costs, giving them time to market and increase the quality of their services. The 3PL advantage lies 
in its commitment to surpassing customer expectations and maintaining a can-do attitude. 
Today, 3PLs have mature offerings in the following areas:
Ocean and airfreight forwarding
•฀
Transportation execution
•฀
Freight bill payment
•฀
Negotiation with carrier

And more!
•฀
Some of the leading 3PLs have further elevated themselves to lead logistics service provider (4PL). These 
companies coordinate activities and monitor the performance and contracts of other logistics companies on behalf 
of manufacturers/shippers. 4PLs also provide technology know-how to manufacturers/shippers and, at times, 
undertake their business processes. 4PLs are seen as a partner that helps large manufacturers/shippers gain supply 
chain efficiency. More and more Fortune 100 organizations are using 4PLs.
In addition, growing prosperity in Southeast Asia is causing consumer markets to boom. Eyeing the 
opportunities, the leading global 3PLs from the rest of the world have already ramped up their operations in this 
region. 
While the 3PL industry is trying to expand its portfolio, increase revenues, and move into different regions, it is 
under tremendous pressure to survive among growing competition. The industry is challenged by
Demanding customers
•฀
Changing regulations and compliance standards
•฀
Lack of skilled/experienced labor resources
•฀
Gap between IT maturity and customer requirements/expectations
•฀
Let’s take a look at the industry’s existing technology landscape. In many cases, it is the result of one or more of 
the following:
Underdeveloped IT strategy, onboarding, system retention (of acquired organizations)
•฀
Decentralized development responsibilities
•฀
Deficient technology: multiple applications providing similar functionalities, old technology 
•฀
platforms, one-to-one integration, poor functional coverage
High maintenance costs, lack of support
•฀
Unavailability of systems, nonscalable transaction-capturing systems
•฀
Merged entities’ continuing on with individual legacy systems
•฀
Poor return on investment

Summary
In this chapter, we explained the evolution of 3PLs and the problems and challenges they face. 3PLs need to focus 
on rationalizing their application landscape, particularly applications that deal with critical functional areas, such 
as order management, transportation planning, execution, pricing and costing, warehousing, finance, and billing. 
These applications have to be looked at holistically, as 3PLs do not have time to deal with them individually. Every day 
that goes by in which a company lacks integrated, technically sound, functionally rich, architecturally well-designed, 
user-friendly applications (preferably on a single platform) to address these critical functions is a day in which that 
company is falling behind the competition. A transportation management system (TMS) covering these business 
functionalities remains a top priority for 3PLs.

CHAPTER 2
The Need for TMS: Challenges,  
IT Landscape
In this chapter, we will cover
The need for a transportation management system (TMS)
•฀
Why third-party logistics providers (3PLs) should invest in TMS product selection
•฀
Benefits of the software as a service (SaaS) model
•฀
What TMS offers
•฀
The role of software systems integrators (SIs)
•฀
The growth of the 3PL industry is dependent on the performance of overall trade. The 3PL industry has grown 
every time  the trade industry has performed better. The present economy has created growth and profit challenges 
for the industry.
When asked, how they plan to expand their business, moving forward their responses usually include one or 
more of the following strategies: 
•฀
Global expansion: Asian markets are performing better than those on other continents. 
Increased consumption by Asians, ready availability of skilled resources at reasonable rates, 
and cost-effective production are among the primary reasons for the growth of these markets. 
In the past, European 3PLs looked to North America for growth, and vice versa. Today, all 
3PLs have their sights set on Asia. Most of the leading 3PLs have created a wider network that 
provides all kinds of logistics services and value-added services that customers in European 
and North America regions enjoy.
•฀
Introduction of new lines of service: In the last decade, most 3PLs have started offering a 
range of services as part of their growth strategy. This change is a result of consolidation and 
customer demand. Today, you will find warehousing organizations that have transportation 
services; freight forwarders that supply customs brokerage services; and road transport 
companies that furnish value-added services, warehousing, and freight forwarding by air, 
ocean, and rail.
•฀
Targeting new industry segments: 3PLs that began their operations by serving a particular 
industry created expertise for that industry’s needs over a period of time.3PLs are now looking 
to leverage their capabilities in order to grow in other industries with similar customer 
requirements.

•฀
Penetrating the small and medium-size markets: The vast majority of companies that work 
with 3PLs are tier 1 enterprises (annual revenues exceeding one billion dollars). However, this 
market segment is almost saturated, so 3PLs have started offering logistics services to small 
and medium-size businesses as a means of sustaining growth. There was less reason for 3PLs 
to focus on this market segment years ago, when there were plenty of multiyear, multimillion 
dollar contracts available from large customers. But, such large-scale opportunities are 
relatively few these days; an increasing number of the requests for proposals (RFPs) received 
for services are smaller in scale and scope than in the past. To maintain their already slim 
profit margins, service providers have to offset these smaller revenue opportunities with lower 
operating costs.
•฀
Merger and acquisition: There have been many mergers and acquisitions in the 3PL industry 
over the past decade. This allows 3PLs to continue to reach out to newer regions and industry 
segments and to acquire expertise in other services.
One of the key constraints in achieving merger and acquisition goals is the existing Internet technology (IT) 
landscape. However, many companies have started to simplify, modernize, and standardize their IT systems, 
recognizing that the existing landscape is becoming an impediment to their growth.
In 2001 we were a part of a team that developed a TMS for India’s leading logistics company. Modules included 
registering business entities (customers, vendors, partners), contract capturing, order management, execution, billing, 
and reporting. Furthermore, we integrated these with SAP, FICO, SD, and vehicle-tracking systems. Work continued 
for more than a year, during which we followed the software development life cycle religiously. The team size at 
peak was close to seventy associates. After moving on to another project and subsequently to another organization, 
we remained in touch with some of our colleagues who were supporting the TMS we developed. One day, we heard 
that the management had decided to invest in a best-of-breed TMS product. They called a few product vendors for a 
demonstration. One of the vendors started carrying out a proof of concept for them. None of the products could meet 
the organization’s requirements. However, this vendor agreed to bridge the gaps identified in its product during a 
joint evaluation. A road map was drawn. Then, we learned that the second attempt did not materialize and that the 
company had gone on to explore yet another option. 
We were sad to know that the system we had built over several months was not being used. A lot of money 
and time were invested in a sincere effort by stakeholders and the project team to make a system that would go a 
long way—a system we had basically conceptualized as an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for a road 
transportation business in India. So, what went wrong? Who should be held responsible? Why had the opportunity 
been lost? Many more unanswered questions troubled us for months, after which we attended a seminar on TMS. 
Our questions were answered as we consulted international logistics players. Whereas we had just started developing 
TMS for Indian companies, others had already been on a similar journey; our experiences were not any different 
from theirs. For many, the aim was to build a system that could address all the company’s requirements and replace 
most of the existing landscape. In reality, many initiatives went on hold because of budgetary constraints; some kept 
missing deadlines, and others concluded with their scope reduced to less than half its original size. In contrast, a few 
developers took a narrow view, creating systems for their business unit, location, and functional areas. Others tried 
their hand at products. Partially available functionalities and unclear and sometimes noncommittal product road 
maps forced 3PL companies to live with whatever they got. They kept building systems around these products or 
continued doing many things manually or inefficiently. 
3PLs are under tremendous pressure to survive among growing competition. They are challenged by demanding 
customers, changing regulations and compliance standards, a lack of skilled/experienced labor resources, and gaps 
between their IT maturity and their customers’ requirements/expectations. In many cases, their existing technology 
landscape is the result of an underdeveloped IT strategy, onboarding, system retention (of acquired organizations), 
and decentralized development responsibilities. The current landscape therefore has characteristics such as deficient 
technology, multiple applications providing similar functionalities, old technology platforms, one-to-one integration, 
poor functional coverage, high maintenance costs, lack of support, unavailability of systems, and nonscalable 
transaction-capturing systems. Moreover, many product vendors did not invest in upgrading their products. Some 
discontinued support for them. Mergers and acquisitions added to the problem, with merged entities retaining their 

CHAPTER 2 ■ THE NEED FOR TMS: CHALLENGES, IT LANDSCAPE 
9
systems. Absence of a corporate IT strategy created a worsening of the situation as well: business and IT managers built 
systems for their needs; as a result, 3PLs have hundreds of systems in their inventory. Maintenance costs are high, and 
return on investment is very poor.  In a landscape such as this, companies cannot achieve objectives such as these:
Ability to manage transport logistics networks in a holistic fashion in order to reduce 
•฀
operational costs and ensure high use of assets and better multi-modal planning
Understanding of cost structures
•฀
Exceeding customer service levels
•฀
Compliance with all regulations and policies
•฀
Improved freight consolidation
•฀
Efficient appointment management
•฀
Greater partner collaboration
•฀
Increased visibility throughout the freight life cycle
•฀
Better decision making
•฀
Tighter control across the entire transport management business, from quoting, to planning, 
•฀
to execution, to monitoring, to settlement
As discussed in Chapter 1, the 3PL industry has largely delayed its rationalization journey. The industry needs 
to makerationalizing its application landscape a priority. Applications that deal with critical functional areas, such as 
order management, transportation planning, execution, warehousing, finance, billing, and pricing and costing, are in 
particular need of attention. TMS therefore emerges as key. Without integrated, technically sound, functionally rich, 
architecturally well-designed, user-friendly applications (preferably on a single platform) to address these critical 
functions, 3PLs will find it difficult to compete. 
In the last five years, we have seen midsize to large 3PLs undertake some big initiatives. Organizations have been 
gearing up to roll out TMS as the core system of their transportation business unit. There are still many functional 
gaps in the TMS offered as off-the-shelf products. However, road maps drawn by these 3PLs with TMS product 
companies appear realistic and within reach. If these initiatives are realized, many 3PLs can reduce their system 
inventory by tens to hundreds, depending on its current state. 
Leading TMS products have functionally evolved and continue to evolve in breadth and depth. Gone are the days 
of buying individual pieces of TMS functionality from multiple vendors. You can now source solutions for your needs 
from a single source. Many vendors have begun offering tools for planning and execution. These tools were used by 
the shipping community for internally controlling and managing costs of the transportation of raw materials and 
finished goods. Over the years, these solutions found some relevance for transportation service providers, and current 
solutions are being used by 3PLs for order allocation, load consolidation, routing, transport mode selection, carrier 
selection, tendering, freight audit, track and trace, and payment and settlement. The newer add-ons are visibility; load 
building; and event, carrier, and performance management.
TMS is a category of software that deals with the planning and execution of the physical movement of goods 
across the supply chain. TMS is used by manufacturers/shippers, multimodal operators, assets, and non-asset–based 
3PLs and 4PLs. TMS is expected to support all modes of transportation, including road, rail, intermodal, air, and 
ocean. Manufacturers/Shippers use TMS to manage freight sourcing, planning, execution, and settlement. 3PLs use it 
for planning and execution. Planning here involves load consolidation, routing, mode selection, and carrier selection; 
execution entails tendering loads to carriers, shipment tracking and tracing, and freight audit and payment. 
Acquiring tools to reduce freight costs continues to be the main reason for investing in a TMS for both 
manufacturers/shippers and 3PLs. This, along with a desire to improve overall efficiency during the entire freight life 
cycle, has forced TMS vendors to expand their TMS suite (TMS Integrated with other required systems); offerings 
now include strategic planning, carrier selection, execution, visibility, performance management, freight payment 
services, and audit capabilities. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ THE NEED FOR TMS: CHALLENGES, IT LANDSCAPE

Multiple subcomponents make up comprehensive multimodal TMS solutions across sourcing, planning, 
optimization, execution, audit and settlement, track and trace/visibility, and performance management. These are 
some of the capabilities provided:
Strategic network design and planning
•฀
Tactical planning
•฀
Multimodal, multileg transportation planning and optimization
•฀
Transportation execution
•฀
Freight rating and contract management
•฀
Asset and freight routing, scheduling, and dispatching
•฀
Freight audit, payment and settlement
•฀
Visibility and event management/business activity monitoring
•฀
Analytics, performance management, scorecards and management dashboards
•฀
Global trade management
•฀
Sound architecture, adaptability, flexibility, usability and deployment options
•฀
Ease of use
•฀
Enabled workflow
•฀
To accelerate implementation of TMS solutions, today’s TMS vendors have established integration with leading 
ERP systems. Post implementation, these integrations mean less manual work and higher assured quality of data. 
Some of the common integrations are as follows:
•฀
Integration with ERP: Performs transportation planning and execution of ERP orders and 
deliveries in TMS and invoicing and invoice verification of TMS settlement documents in 
ERP. Data are transferred using enterprise services. Also integrates TMS with ERP shipment 
processing.
•฀
Integration with track-and-trace application: To help monitor the execution status of 
transportation.
•฀
Integration with global trade management (GTM):  Performs customs processing of 
TMS business documents (e.g., requesting export declarations for freight orders or freight 
bookings). Data are transferred using enterprise services.
•฀
Integration with environment, health and safety (EHS): To ensure the safe transportation of 
dangerous goods, in accordance with legal regulations.
•฀
Integration with business intelligence (BI): Makes use of integrated query and analytic tools 
for evaluating, analyzing, and interpreting business data.
•฀
Integration with a geographic information system (GIS): For data required from a  
location-based-services perspective.
Most of the customers implementing TMS have also built in integration between TMS and their portals. TMS 
gives freight status to portal users, and orders received from portals are planned and executed in TMS. Further 
notifications and approvals are managed between the two systems as well.
Recently, we asked 3PLs, which delivery and implementation approach is best suited to your organization? This 
question would have been unheard of five years ago. Increased maintenance costs and decreased margins have forced 
3PLs to look outside purely traditional ownership models. 3PLs want to focus on their core business, leaving systems

responsibility to systems experts. Many SIs and product vendors offer these next-generation services, such as  
on-premises service, hosting, on-demand service/SaaS, and TMS-managed services. 
These models offer
cost advantage
•฀
minimal risk
•฀
freedom from maintaining infrastructure
•฀
easy availability of software upgrades
•฀
tried and tested solutions
•฀
access to best practices
•฀
(SIs play a big role in TMS implementation, rollout, integration with the ecosystem, and maintenance and 
enhancement. We recommend that you use SIs, as they bring best practices, accelerators, and tools to all these 
services. In addition, some SIs have created business-process outsourcing solutions with respect to these services. 
Service providers set up one or more business-process outsourcing (BPO) centers, depending on the number 
of customers, in countries where this is cost-effective. These centers, equipped with a TMS suite, receive/access 
customer orders, consolidate them, route them, book them with carriers, prepare documentation, report freight 
status, handle claim requests, audit freight, prepare invoices, process bills received from carriers/vendors, measure 
service levels, and generate reports. This gives 3PLs more time to concentrate on their core activities as well as 
providing savings in terms of labor resources and system ownership. 
Manufacturers/Shippers’ greater desire for supply chain optimization and visibility, and continual innovation on 
the part of TMS product vendors, together have been driving growth in the TMS market. C. H. Robinson Worldwide, 
one of the largest 3PL companies in the world, with global operations, has developed strong technology for use in its 
own transportation operations, and this has evolved into its Managed TMS offering, which is deployed by TMC  
(a division of C. H. Robinson). Other Leading TMS providers include SAP, Oracle, JDA Software Group, MercuryGate 
International, Manhattan Associates, IBM Sterling Commerce, TMW Systems, LeanLogistics, Transplace, and 
Interlogistics. See Chapter 3 for more details on these product vendors.
Prima facie, there are many options on the market, but finding which one meets the exact requirements of a given 
3PL company requires analysis. Every company has a unique selling proposition (USP) that helps it grow and retain 
customers. Its processes are accordingly aligned. Therefore, 3PLs must do a careful assessment before deciding to 
invest in a TMS product. See Chapter 5 for further information on how to make a rational choice.
TMS is a core component of a 3PL’s IT landscape. Most business activities are centered on this core component. 
Figure 2-1 shows how TMS is interrelated with other components of the IT landscape.

CHAPTER 2 ■ THE NEED FOR TMS: CHALLENGES, IT LANDSCAPE 
12
As you can see, TMS is integrated with enterprise order management, warehouse management systems (WMSs), 
customer relationship management (CRM), supplier relationship management (SRM), logistics strategy, costing, 
asset management, event management, and so on. Because TMS plays such an important role in managing a 3PL’s 
operations, functionally and technically mature TMS helps 3PLs gain a competitive advantage. 
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed the importance of integrated TMS for 3PLs and the need to do an accurate assessment 
before deciding to invest in TMS products.We also noted that 3PLs should also explore available deployment options 
and the outsourcing of TMS-related business processes in order to gain efficiencies. Finally, we looked at the role of 
SIs in driving transformation.

CHAPTER 3
TMS Product Landscape: Vendors, 
Product Overview, Plans, and 
Comparison
In this chapter, we will describe the following:
The transportation management system (TMS) market
•฀
TMS product vendors’ strategies
•฀
Key trends in the TMS market
•฀
TMS vendors
•฀
The market for TMS is large and growing. Entities in the supply chain—raw material suppliers, traders, 
manufacturers, distributors, retailers, transport and warehousing 3PLs—all need TMS for their organization. A range 
of suppliers, from small boutiques to large enterprise resource planning (ERP) vendors, provides TMS products. 
Furthermore, the TMS market recently witnessed several acquisitions and mergers. Many product vendors started their 
journey with an additional customer or two, developing basic functionality. Then, together with their customers, they 
evolved and developed the missing functionalities. Soon, these product vendors started offering these functionalities in 
the marketplace using, in the initial phase of operation, one or several of the following product strategies:
•฀
Focus on subindustry: Some product vendors remained focused on the vertical market with 
which they were experienced. This gave them reference to potential customers in the same 
vertical subindustry.
•฀
Focus on single process: Emphasis here was on one or two process areas, as available 
capabilities were limited to capturing transactions in the system.
•฀
Focus on regions/countries in closer proximity: These vendors concentrated all their efforts 
on the areas within their reach so that they could give extra attention and provide quick 
resolution. Often, this happened because different regions/countries were following their 
usual processes.
•฀
Perform everything with one’s own resources: To keep knowledge within the company, 
some TMS vendors performed all tasks, from development to rollout, on their own. This did 
not afford them any scale.
•฀
Give every customer a different TMS: Certain vendors believed that every new customer 
required different TMS because each customer has a unique way of working/doing business. 
This called for a lot of bespoke development, resulting in a need for additional investment and 
a delay of return on investment of many years.

CHAPTER 3 ■ TMS PRODUCT LANDSCAPE: VENDORS, PRODUCT OVERVIEW, PLANS, AND COMPARISON
14
Soon, product vendors realized that there were markets for TMS in other industries, subindustries, regions, and 
process areas. In addition, vendors’ customers wanted them to implement the same or similar solutions to their 
operations outside the current region or diversified industry or cater to the other processes in the transportation life 
cycle. The TMS market started growing, and so did the competition. This increased competition created challenges 
for these TMS product companies. To address their needs, TMS vendors have revisited their strategies for growth. 
These are some of their current strategies:
•฀
Acquire to grow: TMS vendors are carrying out self-evaluation to identify gaps in their 
offerings. To bridge the gaps, many are building relationships with other vendors or acquiring 
them in order to reach larger regions and provide solutions to other industries, functions, and 
processes.
•฀
Offer products and services under one roof: Many TMS vendors have built solutions for 
other functions of the supply chain, such as warehousing, yard management, and freight 
settlement, thereby giving customers a single platform for supply chain execution.
•฀
Target additional processes: Build or enhance existing products to include more processes 
in the areas of planning, scheduling, optimization, multimodal operations, global trade 
compliance, and so on. Over time, product companies have developed a process repository, 
and subject matter content that the processes handle is more standardized. This helps 3PLs 
adopt industry best practices when TMS is implemented. For instance, SAP TM is enhancing 
processes such as air and ocean transportation for 3PLs’ businesses.
•฀
Target a specific industry: Build or enhance product for a particular industry. Product 
vendors have gained experience and subject matter understanding of their businesses—
challenges, gaps (and hence opportunities), processes, key performance areas, potential to 
automate, existing technology landscape, and vision for growth. Having understanding of all 
this has helped many vendors build the most relevant products for specific industries. For  
example, MercuryGate TMS solutions is integrating with the Integrated Business Solution (IBS) 
Business Suite, serving customers in key vertical markets, such as 3PL, pharma, auto spare 
parts, and wholesale. Similarly, SAP is planning TM for railroads, given the company’s 
experience with railroad customers worldwide.
•฀
Target technology and architecture: TMS product vendors have identified opportunities in 
the areas of improving integration capabilities, migrating to a newer platform, use of mobile 
technology, and adopting service-oriented architecture (SOA). Integration with systems 
within and outside the organization has remained a priority.
•฀
Partner to gain scale: TMS product vendors have begun establishing their businesses in 
newer regions. For example, Asian markets are increasing in importance for retailers and 
shippers, and to meet their logistics outsourcing needs, 3PLs have set up their operations in 
the pertinent countries. TMS vendors see this as a growth opportunity. Moreover, some of 
the local logistics players in these areas are gaining in size and maturity. They are the next set 
of target/potential customers for the product vendors. Some TMS vendors are expanding by 
using an implementation partner model. The vendors have appointed/partnered with systems 
integrators (SIs) to carry out rollouts and implementation services in these countries. This 
model provides the vendors scale and flexibility, and they need not have large, permanent 
teams. In addition, they can concentrate on product development and enhancement, leaving 
the implementation work to their partners, who are trained in using these products.
•฀
Offer a flexible costing model: Besides the typical licensing model, some product vendors 
are offering software as a service (SaaS), on a pay-per-use or pay-per-transaction basis. This 
model is attracting many small to midsize 3PLs that were managing these functions either 
manually or with the help of outdated applications.

CHAPTER 3 ■ TMS PRODUCT LANDSCAPE: VENDORS, PRODUCT OVERVIEW, PLANS, AND COMPARISON
15
These growth strategies have helped TMS product vendors develop their business, while meeting industry 
expectations. SAP is investing a lot in enhancing the current supply chain execution platform to reach out to new 
markets, such as railroads, for which they already have a large customer base for their other products.
Key Trends in the TMS Market Affecting 3PLs
The 3PL industry evolved greatly in just a few years, from conceptualization to what it is today. We think that lack of 
development is one of the key reasons not many product companies paid a lot of attention in early years. But, the 
industry has grown severalfold and is being seen as having potential for transport management product adoption. 
However, the dynamics and local aspects of the business require highly flexible, functionally rich, technically sound 
products to meet industry needs. Here are some of the trends:
•฀
Custom-Built solutions will continue to be popular, along with TMS products: TMS 
vendors still have a few gaps in their offerings when it comes to the requirements of 3PL 
customers. So long as there are gaps that must be bridged, 3PLs will continue to build 
solutions themselves. Potential TMS customers believe that if the solution is built in-house, 
it will take care of all their requirements; moreover, knowledge remains with them. This, 
however, is not entirely true. We have come across cases in which well before the solution 
could be developed in-house, the business requirements had changed. We believe that neither 
product nor bespoke can immediately address a customer’s changing requirements. Yet, when 
it comes to selecting a product option or building a solution in-house, due diligence must be 
carried out to determine whether the product can cater to ever-changing needs. Also, with 
bespoke development, one must create an architecture that can accommodate such changes 
in the shortest possible time.
•฀
Niche TMS products will continue to find new 3PL customers, along with the leading 
vendors: There are many small to midsize 3PLs operating worldwide. These companies 
have been managing their transportation management solution requirement by using a 
TMS product from a niche product vendor. Until the leading TMS vendors are able to offer 
customized solutions and pricing to suit these small to midsize 3PLs, the trend toward buying 
niche TMS that can cater to their business will continue to prevail.
•฀
TMS will gain center stage: It is anticipated that transportation software will be at the 
center of the landscape and will be integrated with other enterprise solutions, such as global 
trade management (GTS), warehouse management systems (WMS), business reporting 
and business intelligence (BI), customer relationship management (CRM), portal, supplier 
relationship management (SRM), track and trace, ERP, and financial accounting systems. 
Soon, TMS will serve as the “hub” for all these “spoke” systems. TMS will have to share data 
both ways to ensure that nothing is deviating from the standard operating procedure.
•฀
Transportation software will first be used for transportation execution rather than 
optimization: 3PLs will continue to leverage TMS for execution rather than optimization 
primarily for two reasons, the first being the absence of standardized processes at the 
enterprise level and the second being that these companies are still in the process of setting 
up the basic technology platforms needed to automate their processes. In the past, many 
3PLs purchased TMS products for automatically planning and optimizing their networks, 
schedules, routes, and carrier assignments but failed and went back to manual planning. This 
has discouraged these 3PLs from taking a similar journey. Our understanding is that, in most 
cases, the 3PLs did not have standardized processes before embarking on such a journey. In 
addition, the 3PLs should have started by capturing execution, gained confidence, and gotten 
master data in place and processes streamlined and only then used the planning, scheduling, 
and optimization features.

CHAPTER 3 ■ TMS PRODUCT LANDSCAPE: VENDORS, PRODUCT OVERVIEW, PLANS, AND COMPARISON
16
•฀
3PLs will continue to invest in visibility and tracking technologies, along with TMS: 
Customers serviced by 3PLs have evolved their technology landscape, implementing  
best-of-breed solutions for their business needs. These solutions have the ability to interface 
with 3PLs’ systems for order sharing, monitoring status of orders, workflows, and payment.  
The customers therefore expect a total technology conversion between them and their vendors. 
As a result, 3PLs need to have the necessary technology platforms to provide data related to 
the order: bill of lading (BL), house bill of lading (HBL), house air waybill (HAWB), status of 
the order in the execution life cycle, freight costs, accessorial charges, claims, shortages, loss 
and damage, and any other deviation. In this context, 3PLs will continue to invest in mobility 
solutions; tracking with Global Positioning Systems (GPS); or item-level to box-level tracking, 
using radio frequency identification (RFID) or similar technology, along with TMS.
•฀
3PLs will continue to invest in business intelligence (BI) technologies, along with TMS: 
Customers serviced by 3PLs have increased expectations of them. Customers look to 3PLs 
to work as one of the partners in running their business. This has forced a convergence. 
Reporting is one of the vital ways to build trust, confidence, and transparency in the business. 
3PLs have therefore started investing in BI technologies both to know what is happening 
within their own organization and to give different views of the business to the customer. This, 
as well as monitoring key performance Indicators and creating dashboards and “what if?” 
scenarios, is helping 3PLs engage meaningfully with their customers to improve operations, 
stay cost competitive, and build healthy relationships for the long term. The majority of TMS 
products offer a few ready-made reports. However, the expectation is for more. Hence, TMS 
product vendors are also forming integrations with BI products, and when BI is not available, 
3PLs are implementing it, along with TMS products, to gain maximum return on investment.
•฀
TMS vendors will increasingly provide SaaS solutions: 3PLs, in their effort to optimize 
spending on technology, while avoiding noncore functions, such as running the technology 
function themselves, are looking for reliable partners who can take over these responsibilities 
from them. In this context, a few TMS vendors have begun providing TMS, using the SaaS 
model. Although the number of software vendors offering a full-scale SaaS solution is small, it 
is anticipated that increasingly these vendors will furnish this as a cost-effective solution to the 
3PL industry.
•฀
SIs see TMS as a big and long-term opportunity: Many leading SIs see the growth of TMS 
as one of the major opportunities in terms of number, size, and duration of deals with their 
customers. These SIs have created separate teams to focus on this line of business. They also 
have a clear go-to-market strategy to target customers. The initial focus is the possibility of 
picking up a ramp-up customer from their existing customers. In some cases, the solution 
and the commitment are offered jointly (product vendor and SI). Gaps identified during the 
blueprint phase are bridged through development of either a joint intellectual property (IP) 
or next-version system or a system retained for that customer only. Some SIs have moved a 
step further in closing the gap between them and product vendors. These SIs have identified 
use cases that the product vendors do not have in their road map and have proposed building 
these using product platforms, for example, TMS for the shipping industry using a TMS 
platform. SIs also viewed this as an opportunity to get the integration work required with 
TMS. Compared with product vendors, SIs are more versatile with regard to implementation 
and rollout of a product or system. SIs leveraged this capability by becoming implementation 
and rollout partners for TMS product vendors. SIs trained their teams in using the product 
and learned configuration and blueprinting by placing these teams as shadow resources 
with product vendors’ teams during the implementation phase. Then, the SIs were on their 
own. Many 3PLs are present in more than 100 countries. SIs have some presence in most of 
these countries, and this is helping them gain an advantage over TMS product vendors when 
evaluated for implementation and rollout of TMS. Furthermore, the cost of engaging an SI 

CHAPTER 3 ■ TMS PRODUCT LANDSCAPE: VENDORS, PRODUCT OVERVIEW, PLANS, AND COMPARISON
17
vendor for implementation and rollout is lower than that required for using resources from 
product vendors. The next big opportunity SIs have an eye on is annual maintenance contracts 
for TMS as an ongoing revenue stream. Some SIs are also investing in creating TMS platform–based 
business-process outsourcing solutions.
•฀
Consolidation has begun: Other large or similar-size vendors are acquiring TMS products 
or its vendors. For example, IBM recently acquired Sterling Commerce’s TMS. Similarly, JDA 
acquired RedPrairie’s TMS product, and Kewill acquired Foursoft. In the coming years, the 
3PL industry is expected to benefit from this, because the acquiring companies are spending 
more and more money to increase the breadth and depth of their products. These companies 
have started offering them as a service or on a pay-per-use basis, which will free many 3PLs 
from up-front investment toward having TMS on the premises.
Product vendors see the potential in offering TMS to the 3PL industry and are working to bridge the gaps between 
their products and the business requirements and rules of the industry. SAP TM is leading the pack by putting together 
a comprehensive solution for this industry. Other product vendors are producing leading TMS products as well.
TMS Product Vendors
Following are some of the leading TMS product vendors (apart from SAP TM):
Oracle
•฀
IBM
•฀
C. H. Robinson Worldwide
•฀
Infor
•฀
JDA
•฀
Manhattan Associates
•฀
MercuryGate International
•฀
These vendors offer some of the top products available. You may want to consult the company web sites for 
overviews as well as new features, acquisitions, and success stories, which are updated regularly. In addition, you can 
find relevant information on TMS products in “Gartner Magic Quadrant for Transportation Management Systems,”  
an online survey conducted by Gartner every year and available for purchase on its web site (www.gartner.com).  
You can also refer to recent findings of the ARC advisory Group, which presents profiles of TMS vendors and their 
products on its web site.
Most product vendors support planning, optimization, and execution of multimodal business handled by the 3PL 
industry, with varying degrees of coverage. Control tower visibility, workflows, predictive analysis, decision-making 
ability, resource and network optimization, cost optimization, easy integration, and scalability are becoming some of 
the key capabilities requested of TMS products.
Summary
The TMS market has many small to large players. The leading ERPs, SAP and Oracle, both offer TMS. The TMS market is 
growing, and so, too, is the competition. TMS vendors have acquired other TMS vendors or their TMS platform in order 
to reach other regions/countries, subindustries, or process areas. This will continue until the market has three or four 
big names. TMS as SaaS or on an on-demand basis is an opportunity for small to midsize 3PLs to garner the benefits of 
using leading TMS product without the burden of capital costs—for building or buying a TMS or for its maintenance and 
enhancement. The next chapter looks at the details of the SAP TM solution, its architecture and road map.

CHAPTER 4
SAP TM : Overview, Architecture, 
Road Map
In this chapter, we will cover
How SAP Transportation Management (SAP TM) has evolved
•฀
The functional focus of every release
•฀
SAP TM for 3PLs
•฀
The use of new technologies, such as Floor Plan Manager (FPM), Business Rule Framework 
•฀
plus (BRFPlus), and Business Object Processing Framework (BOPF)
Support for an air freight-forwarding scenario
•฀
The SAP TM platform has a long history. SAP TM started with shipment execution functionality, primarily for 
the manufacturing/shipping community, as part of SAP R/2, under Logistics Execution-Transportation (LE-TRA), to 
capture shipment execution-related transaction data. Then SAP TM was an enterprise-centric transportation solution 
used by manufacturers/shippers for freight cost and settlement, billing, freight auditing, and direct store delivery 
as well as simple planning and reporting. Next to arrive was Transportation Planning/Vehicle Scheduling (TP/VS), 
which provided shipment planning and optimization capabilities. Features such as vehicle scheduling and route 
guidance, along with enhanced carrier selection and continuous move optimization, gained industry acceptance. SAP 
Event Management (SAP EM) and and SAP Global Trade Services (SAP GTS) then further strengthened offerings in 
the area of event management across supply chains and border crossings, respectively.
SCM 5.0, an add-on to TM, was enhanced for capacity planning. Business partner collaboration was key, 
particularly for booking ocean vessel capacity. A subsequent pilot solution, strategic freight management (SFM), 
dealt with strategic collaboration and web-based collaboration and had a feature that allowed sharing of requests for 
quotation (RFQs) for ocean and land rates.
SAP TM 6.0 had many improved features: centralized/decentralized TM, adaptive planning, execution,  
re-planning, carrier allocation, single-and multiple stop planning, scheduling, routing and optimization,  
activity-based costing, freight billing, and payment and profit distribution. This solution also provided greater 
visibility for 3PL-based activities, such as freight quotation and buy-and sell-side visibility.
Enabling the user to make optimal use of existing resources, choose the best carrier and means of transport, 
determine the most efficient transport plan with the given constraints, and modify plans based on real progress were 
some of the improved capabilities of SAP TM 6.0. Key drivers for further investment in SAP TM are depicted  
in Figure 4-1.

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP TM : OVERVIEW, ARCHITECTURE, ROAD MAP
20
In many ways, SAP TM 6.0 was a significant improvement over Enterprise Resource Planning Logistics Execution 
System (ERP LES), TP/VS, and SAP Advanced Planning and Optimization (SAP APO) put together.
The major improvements were
A single system for transportation planning, execution, and transportation charge calculation
•฀
Transportation planning and execution for shipments from multiple ERP systems
•฀
Support for peer-to-peer broadcasting and being open to all tendering
•฀
Support for the execution of both inbound and outbound transportation
•฀
Support by transportation proposal/routing guide for the same constraints as in planning  
•฀
(e.g., compartments, trucks, trailers)
Support for master data for standard routes, container, and driver
•฀
Adaptive planning that can be done even after the execution of the transportation activities 
•฀
has begun (e.g., planning new transportation demands for existing shipments)
No limit on the number of transshipment points, or hubs, used in the life cycle of a shipment
•฀
SAP TM 7.0
SAP TM 7.0 had several enhancements in functionality with respect to SAP TM 6.0. The following is a summary of 
these changes:
•฀
Shipment request (SRQ) approval: Condition-based workflow; if SRQ exceeds a specific 
capacity, it must be approved before it can be processed further. The person who is 
responsible for approval gets a message in his or her SAP TM business workplace inbox. He or 
she can accept or reject the approval message.
•฀
Mode-Specific user interface (UI): Additional SRQ entry screens for different types 
(intermodal, air, ocean, land) of shipment requests.
•฀
Adding existing SRQ to a freight request (FRQ): Additional functionality to assign existing 
SRQ in a FRQ.
To drive sustainable savings:

Figure 4-1. Key drivers for investing in SAP TM

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP TM : OVERVIEW, ARCHITECTURE, ROAD MAP
21
•฀
Parcel planning/Tariff planning: Carrier rate integration with external systems and 
integration with external rating engines (SMC3, less than truckload [LTL]); tariff cost 
calculation in SAP TM or procurement of tariff costs from an external system.
•฀
Routing freight units (FUs) of a SRQ individually: Proposals (planning profiles) can be 
created in such a way as to list all possible routes. Users can select different routes for different 
FUs within SRQ.
•฀
GTS integration: Triggers export declaration. Custom status can be considered during the 
execution of shipments.
•฀
Inter-and intra-company cost and revenue distribution: The sales organization is 
responsible for processing a SRQ and charging the customer (customer freight invoice 
request [CFIR]). The purchase organization is responsible for subcontracting transportation 
to a carrier (supplier freight invoice request [SFIR]). Internal charging between the sales 
organization and purchase organization is possible for profit sharing and cost surcharges.
•฀
Multi-resource scheduling: Defining a resource with a means of transport (MTR) that can 
count available resources (e.g., ten trucks with a 20 ton capacity).
•฀
Graphical documentation presentation: All business-related documents appear in graphical 
format under the Document Flow tab.
•฀
Customer fact sheet: Contains a single screen for important customer data and relevant 
analytic content from business intelligence (BI).
•฀
Free fields in SRQ, BO, SO: Custom fields in the aforementioned objects.
In addition to these key features, SAP TM 7.0 also had enhancements in terms of its tendering template  
(the creation of tendering information as master data), resource less schedule creation, addition of one-time manual 
stops during manual planning, and personal object work list (POWL) dynamic selection criteria.
SAP TM 8.0
SAP TM 8.0 entered the market in the ramp-up in November 2010 and reached general availability in June 2011.  
The new release provided these enhancements:
Improved transportation planning
•฀
Reduced transportation costs
•฀
Improved freight consolidation
•฀
Improved use of assets
•฀
Efficient service-level fulfillment
•฀
Improved partner collaboration
•฀
Increased visibility throughout the freight life cycle
•฀
Improved decision making capability
•฀

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP TM : OVERVIEW, ARCHITECTURE, ROAD MAP
22
In SAP TM 8.0 the following product integrations occurred:
•฀
Integration of SAP ERP with SAP TM: Performs transportation planning and execution 
for ERP orders, deliveries in SAP TM and invoicing and invoice verification in ERP for TM 
settlement documents. The data is transferred using enterprise services. Also integrates SAP 
TM with ERP shipment processing. In this case, data is transferred using enterprise services 
and intermediate documents (IDocs).
•฀
Integration of SAP TM with SAP EM: To help track events to monitor the execution status of 
transportation.
•฀
Integration with GTS: Performs customs processing for SAP TM business documents in 
a connected GTS system (e.g., requesting export declarations for freight orders or freight 
bookings). Data is transferred using enterprise services.
•฀
Integration with environment, health, and safety (EHS): To ensure the safe transportation 
of dangerous goods in accordance with legal regulations.
•฀
Integration with BI: Makes use of integrated query and analytic tools for evaluating, 
analyzing, and interpreting business data.
•฀
Integration with a geographic information system (GIS): For data required from a location-
based-services perspective.
With SAP TM integrated with SAP ERP, the manufacturing/shipping community finally got an integrated 
transportation management solution. The introduction of integrated order management made transport planners’ 
lives easier, allowing them to cover order-to-cash (OTC) and procure-to-pay (PTP) processes associated with booking 
and moving freight, albeit with an emphasis still on ocean freight. The transport planner could now get a single view 
of the freight to be dispatched. Moreover, both manual and automatic planning and dispatching were made possible. 
Advanced and dynamic transportation optimization combined inbound and outbound planning features to help 
manufacturers/shippers optimize their transportation resources. This release came with some additional decision-
supporting reports and views that helped manufacturers/shippers improve their service levels at reduced cost. With 
this release, management was also improved. Integrated global cross-border management and dangerous goods 
acquisition attracted manufacturers/shippers’ attention. In the case of the scheduler workplace, new features were 
added, and some SAP TM 7.0 features were enhanced; new features included searching for replacement resources for 
an existing assignment, editing demand splits, automatic scheduling of multiday assignments, copying time allocations, 
confidentiality of resource names (displaced for authorized users only), connections to external GIS systems (enhanced), 
container positions saved in the scheduler by user, resource list re-sorting directly in the planning board, and separate 
dialog boxes for work lists. The planning board now contains a button that allows the user to align assignments.
The web-based planning board introduced resource planning, making optimization possible at the team level, as 
well as multiday planning, optimization, and appointment booking. A parts availability check was also added to the 
planning board, along with mass change and assignment.
The development focus for SAP TM 8.0 was customer co-innovation, deep-process integration (OTC, PTP, 
customs and compliance management, DGR), best-in-class functionality, collaboration, decision making, flexibility, 
simplicity, and performance.
SAP TM 8.1
The main focus of SAP TM 8.1 was to extend solutions to support 3PLs. SAP TM 8.1 entered ramp-up in August 2011. 
SAP TM 8.1 extends the core transportation processes covered by SAP TM 8.0 to support enhanced
Ocean freight management
•฀
Transportation network planning
•฀
Quotation and forwarding order management
•฀

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP TM : OVERVIEW, ARCHITECTURE, ROAD MAP
23
Freight booking and service order management
•฀
Cargo management
•฀
Furthermore, a new scenario was included: less than container load (LCL), for 3PLs. SAP TM 8.1 also delivers 
general enhancements for both manufacturers/shippers and 3PLs, including
Advanced transportation planning
•฀
Advanced charge management and settlement
•฀
Enhanced analytics
•฀
A fragmented system landscape, point-to-point legacy systems for transport execution (often different ones for 
each mode of transport) without proper integration, old technology in need of replacement, a lack of experienced 
developers for legacy technology, the absence of a software vendor for transport execution with double-digit market 
share, a presence limited to the local or regional level, minimal innovation, and limited development and support 
capability were some of the challenges faced by supply chain convergence agents. Among 3PLs, challenges were great 
because of the increasing gap between their existing technology landscape and the expectations of their customers. 
-A growing need for network planning and cargo optimization to increase margins and compliance, along with the 
proactive monitoring of execution status visibility and collaboration, added to these issues.
With SAP customers’ being responsible for 86 percent of the athletic shoes, 70 percent of the chocolates, 50 
percent of the branded jeans, 72 percent of the beer, and 77,000 of the cars produced per day worldwide, SAP had a 
complete understanding of the widening expectation gap between industry leaders and their 3PL partners.
SAP continued investing in its goal of being the market leader in supply chain execution and sought leadership in 
supply chain convergence by creating best-in-class solutions (functionality, complete and comprehensive), integrated 
and connected processes (intra-and inter-enterprise solutions, end-to-end process integration, out-of-the-box 
connectivity), and vertical offerings (industry-specific functionality, but also multi-industry offerings). While moving 
forward in the journey of building solutions for freight forwarding and the 3PL industry, SAP did try, we believe, to 
answer some of the key questions of 3PL industry leadership, such as
How can I manage my logistics network in a holistic fashion that is beneficial to both my 
•฀
customers and my profitability?
How can I provide operational excellence to my customers without sacrificing my  
•฀
bottom line?
How can I leverage my transportation network as 3PL and make informed decisions about the 
•฀
best use of purchased services from carriers/partners?
How do I ensure high customer service levels and responsiveness to unexpected supply chain 
•฀
events?
How do I ensure that I am compliant with all regulations?
•฀
How do I implement Internet technology (IT) solutions quickly on a global and local scale as 
•฀
needed?
The industry was on the lookout for a system that could offer robust functionality to meet a diverse set of 
requirements, while enabling ease of business strategy execution, providing a platform for growth, and reducing risk 
to business continuity—a system that could become a catalyst rather than a hindrance and lower long-term total cost 
of ownership (TCO) through the elimination of the many legacy systems and multiple integrations to achieve higher 
return on investment (ROI) in every business unit/functional area. SAP continues to invest in TM for the 3PL industry. 
SAP TM 9.0 is a result of this initiative.

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP TM : OVERVIEW, ARCHITECTURE, ROAD MAP
24
SAP TM 9.0
With SAP TM 9.0, SAP has released a much awaited solution that many manufacturers/shippers and 3PL industry 
members believe will go beyond any best-of-breed products available on the market. SAP TM 9.0 is a complete 
transportation management solution. It includes not only enhanced support for all means of transport (including 
ocean, air, road, and rail) for shippers and manufacturing industries, but also native collaborative scenarios between 
manufacturers/shippers and 3PLs. SAP TM 9.0 supports processes required for domestic and international freight 
forwarding and is compliant with international trade management and dangerous goods regulations. In addition, SAP 
TM 9.0 provides interactive transportation and shipment planning, along with collaborative tendering, integrated 
fulfillment, execution, visibility in the freight life cycle, complete freight cost management, and integrated freight and 
forwarding settlement.
With the SAP TM 9.0 implementation,support for end-to-end intermodal airfreight and ocean freight scenarios 
for small freight to container load was achieved. The end-to-end life cycle of freight begins as follows:
Freight pick up from manufacturer/shipper
•฀
Transport by truck to an origination terminal/ hub/station for processing/consolidation and 
•฀
onward planning
Booking with main carriage
•฀
Transfer by road to the container freight station (CFS)/airport hub for the main journey as 
•฀
applicable
Customs clearance at the origin and destination gateways
•฀
Transport between the port of destination to the destination terminal/hub/station for 
•฀
processing/deconsolidation and onward planning by road
Delivery to the consignee by road
•฀
Also supported:
Required documentation
•฀
Data exchange
•฀
Reporting and decision support
•฀

•฀
Support for industry standards, such as The Air Cargo Tariff and Rules (TACT) and Cargo 
•฀
Accounts Settlement Systems (CASS)
This, along with enhanced decision support and event tracking, particularly from an airfreight perspective, 
helped SAP look good in the TM space. SAP emerged as visionary, committed, and industry focused.
With SAP TM 9.0, SAP’s extended communication and connectivity to the entire ecosystem of the supply  
chain–converging the elements and actors, enables effective collaboration among them. These ready-to-use integrations 
helped SAP gain mileage over its competition. E-mails and short message service (SMS) notifications requesting quotations 
from carriers, freight orders, or freight bookings to share with the carrier; event sharing on mobile and other modes; 
and data exchange for freight rates, schedules, and mode-specific transaction messages made users’ lives simpler and 
minimized data errors, while sharing information and improving customer and partner experiences.

Air freight as a New Scenario
Until now, TM was seen by 3PLs as applicable only to ocean business. The industry was unsure of airfreight 
support. However, SAP worked with its customers to build integrated solutions supporting air-and ocean freight in 
parallel. The journey from transportation management for manufacturers/shippers to internal transportation needs, 
to full-container ocean freight, to LCL volumes, to the airfreight business only proves the vision and commitment of 
SAP. Additional details on air freight are provided here for reference. SAP TM 9.0 supports air-freight-related activities, 
ranging from order taking to final billing and settlement, both at origin and destination stations as well as their 
respective gateways.

SAP TM Road Map
If you take a close look at the SAP transportation and logistics road map, it is very clear that transportation and 
logistics together form a major area of investment for SAP. To build a best-in-class TM solution with industry focus, 
SAP is working in close collaboration with industry leaders in supply chain convergence, making this its highest 
priority in the entire development life cycle. In addition to enriching current solution functionally, SAP is also 
investing in next-generation technologies, such as SAP High-Performance Analytic Appliance (SAP HANA), and is 
working to increase mobility and build a seamless integrated suite for supply chain execution.

Summary
SAP TM has evolved from being a collection of systems capturing transaction data to a single system that provides 
extended communication and connectivity to the entire ecosystem of supply chain–converging elements and actors, 
enabling effective collaboration among them. This has simplified users’ lives and minimized data errors, while 
allowing for sharing of information and improving the customer and partner experience. SAP has shown commitment 
to further investing in this product to cover remaining modes and actors, introduction of new technologies, and 
improving ease of integration. There are many TM products on the market; however, we believe that SAP ooffers good 
value. To make your TM selection, we suggest that you make use of our product selection framework in Chapter 5.

CHAPTER 5
TMS Selection Framework
In this chapter, we will deal with
The need for a structured and scientific selection process
•฀
The value of a product selection framework
•฀
Features of a product selection framework
•฀
The importance of adopting industry best practices
•฀
Preparation required before initiating product selection
•฀
The transportation management system (TMS) product market is crowded with the offerings of leading 
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product companies, boutiques, niche players, and segment specialists as well 
as enterprise resource planning (ERP) giants, such as SAP and Oracle. The majority of these products provide 
functionality of 50 percent or better of the full range of functionality one would hope for. Most were designed 
to cater to the needs of manufacturers/shippers. A few companies have also invested in solutions that address 
segment/vertical challenges better than those of other companies. However, many of the products still rely on older 
technology, have challenges in integration and scalability, and have not received an upgrade in decades. Some have 
remained conservative when it comes to creating a network of implementation and rollout partners. Implementations 
and rollouts carried out by such companies are therefore expensive and time-consuming. As a result, many buyers 
have lost patience and aborted their incomplete journey or suffered multifold cost overruns that did not justify 
investment, or both.
For several years, the 3PL industry did not draw the attention of many of these companies. 3PLs continued to 
invest in homegrown systems, with individual regions and profit centers building their own systems. Acquisitions 
and mergers further added to these complexities. Generally, mergers remained limited to high-level businesses, 
yet local systems remained The lack of corporate guidelines/direction concerning platform, technology, and 
integration resulted in these 3PLs’ continuing on with hundreds or thousands of systems. Many leaders and tier 2 
challengers have either drawn their IT landscape strategy or are in the advanced stages. A few are in talks with TMS 
product companies.
The potential benefits of using TMS products are increased reliability and stability, shorter development time, 
and reduced costs. Given the dynamic nature of the TMS marketplace, a number of parameters should be analyzed 
as 3PLs evaluate new TMS products and vendors. The success of a product largely depends on selection of the right 
product. Careful analysis of the capabilities and limitations of products is a must.
Selection should be made by a process of elimination. Eliminate products that do not meet your organization’s 
requirements.
The objective of incorporating our TMS product selection framework in this book is to offer a comprehensive, 
easy-to-use, industry-proven guide that can help you select the most appropriate TMS product for your 3PL, one that 
can provide increased return on investment and long-term solutions.

CHAPTER 5 ■ TMS SELECTION FRAMEWORK
32
The framework has the following core sections:
Business Functionality
•฀
Technical Compatibility
•฀
Non-product Contributions
•฀
Costs
•฀
The framework presents summaries by product and core section. The weight assigned to each core section is based 
on the experience of the authors in the area of logistics as well as corroboration by C-level executives of leading 3PLs.
The authors suggest a demonstration-based selection approach in which 3PLs, on their own or with the help of 
third-party experts or a consulting firm, prepare a profile that captures their current and future processes. The profile 
must include all exceptions and deviations as well as business rules and real data. Share the profile with product 
vendors, and ask them to demonstrate their product in terms of the profile. The demonstration plays an important role 
in the evaluation of business functionalities and most aspects of technical compatibility. It is highly recommended 
that internal agreement be reached as to the business processes to be mapped before contacting vendors.
Products offer best practice processes. Products represent a wealth of experience gained over years of 
implementation with different customers. Buyers should attempt to gain as much as they can from this experience. 
These best practices help buyers achieve operational efficiency, costs reduction, improved collaboration, and 
customer satisfaction. In the past, many buyers ignored this fact totally or partially, citing the expense entailed in 
alignment with best practice processes. These buyers therefore did not make use of most product functionalities. As 
a result, the buyers’ return on investment was poor. Buyers should have a detailed understanding of these processes; 
carry out gap analysis between the industry best practices suggested for the selected product and their own current 
processes; prioritize these practices; and come up with a plan to implement them while the selected product is 
customized, configured, implemented, and rolled out. Implementation and rollout should follow the process changes, 
and not the other way around.
Business functionalities included in the framework capture an entire freight life cycle, from order to payment. 
In your analysis, you should include functionalities that are not presented here but that are typical of your business 
or your unique selling proposition (USP). Such functionalities may receive more weight, as they are critical to your 
business. If so, you will need to change the weight accordingly for the rest of the functionalities to keep the total at 
100 percent. Emphasis must be given to your key and unique functional needs, while staying focused on capabilities 
to capture, using transactional data. Capability in the areas of planning, scheduling, reporting, visibility, event 
management, workflow, and notification must be analyzed with your own data.
Technical compatibility with the existing or proposed landscape plays a vital role in the selection of any product. 
The more specific you are (in terms of integration and technology), the smoother your future will be. Ignoring any 
aspect of technical compatibility may result in a major increase in maintenance costs, plus time taken to devise 
work-arounds.
Every aspect of non-product contribution is critical to implementation and thereafter.
The authors suggest the following steps before inviting product vendors for the product selection process:
The sponsor identifies a core team.
•฀
The core team, along with the sponsor, is to have a clear view of the changing business model 
•฀
and big-ticket changes that are part of your firm’s vision.
The core team includes technology and functional single points of contacts (SPOCs), in 
•฀
addition to other stakeholders.
The core team identifies a functional SPOC from transportation planning, execution, customer 
•฀
service, finance, sales, and technology.

CHAPTER 5 ■ TMS SELECTION FRAMEWORK
33
The functional SPOC team details processes, including scenarios, deviations, exceptions, and 
•฀
business rules; this information is then shared with product vendors so that they have time 
to incorporate it in their product demonstration. The technology SPOC delineates platform-, 
environment-, and integration-related expectations for the new product.
A short list no more than ten products for evaluation.
•฀
As part of the selection process, these steps are recommended:
Invite shortlisted vendors to demonstrate how their product meets your requirements.
•฀
Make use of the parameters of the TMS product selection framework for evaluation (see the 
•฀
tables in the section “TMS Product Selection Framework” later in this chapter).
SPOCs evaluate each product separately.
•฀
A summary of the evaluation is prepared.
•฀
The product with higher scores is selected.
•฀
Business Functionality
Evaluation of business functionality is vital to the success of the product selection process. It is the tendency of product 
companies to create hype about their products’ functionality. Never go by the company’s promotional material; check 
things out on your own. The best way to do this is by inviting companies to demonstrate their offerings and clearly 
show how they are relevant to your business. Some products may have functionalities that are not required by your 
organization. Make sure you do not discount these wares simply because you are not yet ready for them or do not 
anticipate needing them. Your organization may change and evolve, either because of challenges it encounters or 
because of its vision and goals, and if your core team is not , and knowledgeable about the firm’s mission, it may not give 
adequate attention to the product demonstration. As a result, your company may miss an opportunity for future growth.
TMS Product Selection Framework
The product selection framework that follows contains parameters with respect to the business and technical 
functionalities on which the product may be evaluated. The framework also has parameters for assessing the product 
company. These parameters will assist you in selecting a product that meets your organization’s requirements (see 
Figures 5-1–5-5).

Summary
Selection of the TM product best suited to your organization is a priority and a major milestone in making your 
technology landscape more reliable, stable, and able to achieve higher return on investment. Before initiating the 
project journey, however, you need to have a clear idea of your organization’s vision goals, and business case.  
The first step in your journey is the preparatory phase, in which you identify a core team and SPOCS to document 
your business’s processes and establish an implementation and rollout strategy. When choosing a product (and 
afterward), keep in mind that products provide best-practice processes. Do not ignore them, or your firm may risk 
losing its competitive edge. By making use of our product selection framework, you are ensuring selection of an 
appropriate TM product. It is always advisable to add to the standard functionalities contained in our framework 
those functionalities that are unique to your business.
Now that you have selected a product, we will give you some tips on how to implement it. The next chapter serves 
as a guide to implementing TM, particulary SAP TM.

•฀
Organizations planning on replacing legacy systems that are unable to keep up with growing business 
requirements with a state-of-the-art integrated solution, such as SAP TM, are always looking to find answers to a 
variety of questions relating to the solution, such as its necessity, its functionalities and, more important, how it can 
meet the firm’s needs. Best practices and effective approaches for speedy and effective implementation are other 
considerations (see Figure 6-1).

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
38
Having seen a few SAP TM implementations and rollouts, we believe that the process is a journey. The success of 
this journey depends on your firm’s approach. Some organizations have come at it as an organizational transformation 
initiative. Other organizations have treated it as just one more information technology (IT) project. We believe that 
it is an important transformation initiative, not the responsibility of any one department or individual. The change 
involves a lot more than just installing a software product. SAP TM, as a supply chain execution platform, is a core 
system for 3PLs. The preparation required for such a large initiative may need to begin two to three years prior. Before 
implementing this system, organizations must have clear answers to fundamental questions such as these:
Why is such a transformation required? Does this transformation align with our vision for the 
•฀
next decade?
What are the key success factors?
•฀
What does our competition look like?
•฀
Do we have strong executive sponsorship?
•฀
Do we have a sufficient budget planned for such a transformation?
•฀
Do we meet all critical requirements in our functional areas for this implementation?
•฀
Are all of the processes relating to our unique selling proposition (USP) documented?
•฀
Are we equipped to handle such a large change at every organizational level?
•฀
Do we need an expert’s guidance for this journey? Do we have access to such an expert if needed?
•฀
Have we identified key resources from each area, and can we spare them for this process?
•฀
Do we have the bandwidth to manage training needs?
•฀
Do we have a defined IT strategy?
•฀
Depending on the answers to these questions, you can judge whether your organization is ready for a 
transformation of this magnitude or if more preparation is needed. How the organization will keep moving forward 
after the transformation must be thought out before initiation of the preparatory phase of any transformation as well.
Poorly managed transformations tend to receive the kind of feedback illustrated in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2. Feedback on a poorly managed transformation

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
39
It is our aim to help you avoid a situation that would invite comments such as these. We are hopeful that our 
suggestions in this chapter will ensure that your organization’s journey is a smooth one.
Implementation is the act of accomplishing an objective. To begin, you have to know what your firm’s goals are 
and how practical the aims are that you are trying to achieve.
Where does your organization want to go? How ready is it to embark on this journey? What are the practical steps 
that will enable it to reach its destination? How do you create an organization-wide culture of continual change in 
order to stay on top for the long haul?
In replacing your organization’s systems approach, you want an integrated, functionally rich, growth-supportive 
business management solution that is capable of bringing about greater productivity and effective communication 
within the organization’s ecosystem. The first step toward this end destination is the preparatory phase.
Preparatory Phase
When does your organization begin implementation? If your answer is today, it is doubtful that you will be successful. 
Implementation of this magnitude requires a great deal of preparation. Let’s look at some of the key tasks.
Obtain executive commitment (directly proportional to success)
Is executive commitment important to this initiative? The answer is obviously yes, because otherwise nothing will 
progress. Executive commitment is crucial to delivering expected results on schedule and within budget. Knowing 
your project sponsor, and his or her managerial style, is critical.
Many project sponsors do not spend sufficient time on the project. As a chief information officer (CIO), however, 
you cannot afford to have a disconnected executive sponsor. Ensure that you engage the sponsor from the kickoff to 
the end—this can mean the difference between success and failure. Communicate clearly with your sponsor; the best 
project sponsors make themselves available. Your sponsor must appreciate that the sponsor’s role is to authorize the 
project and that your role is to execute it. The sponsor must therefore let the project managers manage the project 
without getting into the day-to-day particulars themselves.
It is of the utmost importance that you obtain everyone’s full commitment up front, because once the project 
starts; doing so is twice as hard. Typically, executives will say that they support any initiative with a sound return on 
investment, but then they do not back that up when it comes to allocating the money and resources that are required 
to make an initiative a success. Obtaining executives’ time to resolve problems, for example, can be difficult. We have 
seen many demoralized, unmotivated project teams result from half-hearted executive support. Often, you start to 
wonder if your executive sponsor has had a change of heart. We suggest that unless a valid rationale is provided for 
such behavior, you should stay focused on the project’s goals. It is also a good idea to remind the sponsor about the 
commitment made at the start of the project by making small presentations periodically on the project’s achievements 
and what is left to accomplish.
It is good practice to have the project sponsor begin the kickoff meeting by clearly communicating the business 
case for the initiative, backed by goals and objectives, benefits, and the vision, so that everyone knows their 
responsibilities and the kind of contribution expected. Involving the project sponsor in building the project plan will 
ensure that it is complete and detailed.
Build a business case for positive return on investment
The rationale behind building a business case is to clearly ask for the money and resources required to support 
a specific business need. Business needs may entail improving system performance; achieving greater customer 
satisfaction; or increasing profits, lowering costs, or reducing processing time. Benefits can be quantifiable or not. 
Make sure you have a sound business case that details the background of the project, expected benefits, options 
available, reasons for short-listing a particular objective, expected costs, risks, and resource requirements. A business 
case is a collection not only of data, but also of positive and negative opinions and views from relevant stakeholders.

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
40
Why do we require building a business case? We do so because a scientific approach to your problem definition 
always helps. A new SAP TM system provides your organization with fresh opportunities to use and refine new 
business processes; the business case–building exercise is your first chance to introduce these new areas. Discuss 
existing processes, business drivers, areas of difficulty, improvement areas, competitors, anticipated impact of 
changes, and people to be affected. Analyze the historical data to ascertain missed opportunities and wrong 
assumptions and to suggest a to-be landscape. Assess costs, resources, and time required to realize the ideal scope.
As mentioned earlier, as a CIO, you should help the project sponsor build a sound business case. Comprehensive 
data collection and analysis together form the first step in planning any initiative of this magnitude. Your team can 
help educate your organization’s business professionals about next-generation technologies that can solve their 
problems. Organize demonstrations of solution/product vendors if required.
As a transformation leader, you need to work with your sponsor to craft a presentation that gives a complete picture 
(see Figure 6-3). This should include the scope of the project, potential savings, areas of improvement, possible risks, 
and challenges (including the support required in terms of time, money, and resources). The presentation should 
focus on improving the bottom line and on how the initiative can help the organization reach its business objectives, 
making the benefits clear. Tie benefits to profit, cash flow, and so on. Ideally, you should present a scenario for return 
on investment. Address executives’ concerns, such as whether you can achieve your goal in a reasonable period of 
time and whether it is even attainable. As the owner of the business case and guardian of the investors’ interests, the 
project sponsor must be the one to secure buy-in from every stakeholder.
Figure 6-3. Key drivers for investing in a new, global system
Set goals, manage by objectives
Before beginning the project, it is important to set goals for each of the following stages of the life cycle:
Design
•฀
Construction
•฀
Testing
•฀
Deployment
•฀
Build the scenario—engage people in your dream
Storytelling is a good way to share messages. Your project sponsor can use this proven tool to share his or her vision 
and to communicate what you as a team plan on doing, how you are going to accomplish this, what the plan will 
mean to others, what help you need, who is helping you, how will this affect others in the short and long term, and 
so on. The project sponsor should conduct workshops, outlining the key individuals involved and inviting people 
performing different roles to speak. Your project sponsor’s aim should be to spread awareness and gain organizational 
support from every corner of the business in order to minimize internal challenges.

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
41
Create a task force—your ambassadors of change
Consider pulling the best talent from various teams to create a task force that will work on accomplishing the common 
goal. The right mix of talent can give you a quick start and continued success throughout the journey and thereafter. 
Enlist resources from different levels, making sure to include senior and experienced individuals. Never insist on only 
the most experienced team members, however. Younger people may provide energy and optimism; veterans may 
offer insights gained from experience. Often, veterans run the risk of losing touch with what’s happening at lower 
levels of the organization. You will need input as well from those who have a broader view of things.
From this task force, create the following four groups:
•฀
Steering committee (two to three members): To facilitate, monitor, and guide the rest of the 
teams.
•฀
Change control board (three to four members): To review and approve changes to the scope.
•฀
Selection committee (four to five members): To select the appropriate solution.
•฀
Project teams and leadership: Choose a program manager and project leaders for every 
project team. The project team at the corporate office and the regional project teams should 
have one subject matter expert (SME) for every process/functional area. We suggest that 
you colocate (at least initially) the first three groups in order to gain maximum efficiency 
from them. Periodically relieve the project teams and selection committee of their regular 
responsibilities. Organize some games and informal workshops for them to build a sense of 
belonging to a team that is working on a common cause. Workshops conducted by external 
faculty are a good way to motivate teams and obtain maximum contribution. Monetary 
incentives are not necessary, but other types of rewards and recognition may have a  
positive impact.
Train the selection committee
Should the selection committee receive training? The answer is a big yes, as this committee, in the absence of 
structured training, will be more apt to make bad choices. Many organizations underestimate this important need. 
Often, choosing a transportation management–centric system is a multimillion-dollar, multiyear decision affecting 
the entire organization. This certainly demands extensive training in team building, decision-making, assessment, 
and soft skills. It is advisable that the selection committee undergo training on how to work together, make group 
decisions, and analyze needs at both the central and local level.
Ensure resource commitment—nothing in life comes for free
Generally, when a corporate initiative launches, people in the branch offices, terminals, and support functions 
tend to believe that it is the responsibility of the corporate technology team to implement the system and that 
this team will send someone from the head office to do so. Remember that the success of any initiative is realized 
when the end organization are brought on board appropriately. Besides the champions in the task force, in which 
commitment is long-term, you must also have commitment from branch and regional offices and terminals as well 
as support function teams before you start the project. To get this commitment, you may conduct regional-level 
workshops, in which you should invite participation from the smallest of your locations and support functions.

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
42
Manage change management
Your transformation initiative may have an impact on the way you deal with your customers and vendors. Changes 
made as a result of the new model, systems, processes, or strategy must be communicated clearly and at an 
appropriate time and outline how the customers/vendors will be affected in the changed scenario. The group that 
will be affected the most is your employees. Make sure every employee, irrespective of designation, role, location, 
seniority, and skill set, is made aware of the changes. Communicate this information to employees up front, and 
conduct workshops on the transformation initiative. People must gain an understanding of why the change in strategy 
or in culture is needed and how it will affect them, covering in particular modifications in their roles, responsibilities, 
location, and teams. Any change is likely to be seen as political, and as employees will be critical in carrying out your 
firm’s initiative, clear communication with them at appropriate times and intervals is suggested. People generally 
perceive change negatively in the beginning. This is when, besides a central team managing the change, the respective 
managers must actively contribute toward it. To realize benefits from such a major investment, an integrated 
technology, process, and awareness of people’s needs are of importance.
Do not expect everything will change—set expectations
You have been in the business for some time now. You have been making changes since you started, to comply with 
regulations, adapt to changing business requirements, or create differentiation. All this is either captured in one of the 
systems or is part of the manual work being carried out by your teams. The nature of these changes may have been 
at a global, regional, or branch level. Perhaps some of the changes that evolved over the years are documented, and 
others are not. A baseline version that captures these changes and decisions and their descriptions should be your 
starting point. You may also have some other helpful features, such as suggestions from users on adjusting to a new 
environment. As an unwritten rule, do not expect everything to undergo change in one round—certainly not at the 
magnitude we are discussing. No one solution can give you everything, and customization (major or minor) may be 
required. Therefore, internally you need to clearly set expectations in terms of what is achievable and which items are 
set aside, either for the time being or indefinitely. Acceptance from users will likely be greater if they are aware of what 
to expect from the transformation.
Manage risk early on
Can you afford to put such a project at risk? Obviously not. But, you cannot have a project without risk, and even a 
small risk can get out of control and become a major hurdle in optimally delivering the project. Therefore, it is very 
important to identify potential risks at an early stage, analyze them thoroughly, and initiate appropriate preventive 
measures to avoid them. Deviations, short supply, idle time, inadequate communication, lack of preparedness, and 
overruns are some of the risks you should be able to identify easily.
Build a global process repository—include local requirements
Business processes lay the foundation for your business. Organizations that practice standardization of processes 
across the organization are more successful than their counterparts that do not. For a multinational logistics 
company, process complexities may increase because
The organization has its own operations in some countries; agents (some dedicated, some 
•฀
not), or a combination of an agent and a partner, working on behalf of it in other countries; 
and partners in remaining countries and locations of the network
The system landscape is not the same at every location
•฀
The processes are different
•฀

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
43
The level of automation is different
•฀
Regulatory requirements differ from place to place
•฀
Many processes are not documented, or, if they are documented, they are incomplete  
•฀
or outdated
No central team has been appointed to control the version or approve changes
•฀
As a result of this, process understanding at each location may be different. But, with respect to the 
transformation initiative, the firm needs to do the following:
Have a globally standardized process, with localization (permissible only in the case of 
•฀
statutory or compliance requirement) in documented form and controlled at a central 
location by a central process custodian, the chief process officer (CPO) team
Ensure that changes have been made to its processes to accommodate what it seeks to 
•฀
accomplish
Create a site or a link on its knowledge portal, where everyone can easily refer to process 
•฀
documentation (provide read-only access only); right to update should be retained by the 
central process custodians
Make the CPO team responsible for retaining version control, with any changes requiring the 
•฀
team’s approval
Capture these processes in a content/document management tool and, if possible, in a 
•฀
business process–mapping tool
Use the latest version of SAP TM to map processes
•฀
Share any change to processes with the change control board; it should be the board’s 
•฀
prerogative to include it at the time of ongoing implementation or to put it aside for the  
next release
Engage a third party to study, analyze, and build global processes
•฀
Identify process champions from planning, execution, order management, scheduling, hub, 
•฀
terminal, branches, and all the support functions, if they are not already part of the CPO team; 
engage these champions early on
Identify processes that will be affected by implementation of a new solution, and spend extra 
•฀
time standardizing them
It may also be desirable to keep a record of the time taken to perform/complete processes—if not all, at least the 
key ones, from an operational and customer-facing perspective.
Have clear interface requirements
Now that you know which processes will be affected by implementation of a new solution, we recommend that you 
identify every single interface requirement of these processes, with respect to give-and-take of data, frequency, use, 
size, volume, and current mechanism. This will help you in every step of the journey, whether it be selection (if not 
already made), building a conference room pilot, or testing rollouts. Gathering information on challenges faced 
during interfacing is also helpful.

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
44
Identify events
Event notification is assumed to be part of a main service, and your organization’s ability to share events is one of 
the key criteria on which it is judged. Many of your competitors may be struggling to capture important events and 
therefore unable to share them. This is a golden opportunity to set things in order for your organization. We suggest 
that you hold a workshop for departments such as customer service, business development, operations, field, asset 
management, and accounts receivable to agree on events for which capture and notification of parties are needed. 
As a rule, information that requires action from someone, closes a loop, or is an intimation to someone needs to be 
tracked. Make sure to have this information recorded in process documents, in the appropriate locations.
Identify workflow
Workflow plays an important role in informing concerned parties of the need to act. You should have a workflow 
for time-sensitive tasks to improve your service levels, reduce communication costs, and resolve issues in a timely 
manner. List all time-sensitive tasks, identifying the people to be notified and the action expected. You may also want 
to tie this in with your process documents.
Use reports, key performance indicators, dashboards
You may be currently using a tool for your reports. The new system can provide most of them, and more. You need 
to keep an inventory of reports on your organization’s processes as well as the distribution list agreed on. Moreover, 
you may use this opportunity to look into these reports to see if any can be consolidated or eliminated altogether. 
You will also want to identify key performance indicators by process, creating a matrix of tasks or activities, by role, 
for the dashboard.
Clean the master data
Can you guarantee clean master data at any given point in time? You may want to say yes, but you know the real 
answer. Organizations are spending a lot of time and money to get a single version of master data. A disciplined 
approach is required to maintain the purity of this data. As a CIO, it is your responsibility to ensure quality master 
data on people, places, things, and concepts available for implementation. Duplicate records, confusion over 
what master data are and how they are qualified, and absence of a central team responsible for creation and 
maintenance of master data can add to the challenge. However, with SAP TM Supply Chain Execution (SCE) platform 
implementation, master data serve as a key asset. First, they are almost always involved in transactional and analytical 
operations. Second, users performing different processes across your organization use them. You should clean master 
data, augmenting and synchronizing them with applications identified for replacement with the new SAP TM–centric 
solution, respective business processes, and reporting requirements before starting the implementation journey.
Role-based access control (RBAC)—one who creates cannot approve
Identify all roles and responsibilities. Based on roles and responsibilities for a process or part of any process, grant 
users access to the relevant menu of the new solution. Also, clearly identify rights to create, view, and modify. 
During data collection, you may come across situations in which your current systems allow users to both create a 
record and approve it. To avoid this with the new solution, you must clearly document segregation of duties  
(Doc-RBAC + SOD).

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
45
Validate the solution against architecture guiding principles
Your organization may have adopted guiding principles with respect to its architecture and design aspects. The new 
solution must receive validation against these guiding principles. Any deviation must be understood and its impact, 
reviewed and agreed on. You should discuss this openly with a solution provider, make him or her aware of any 
deviation, and find a work-around before moving forward with the new solution.
Decide on an implementation strategy—manageable, in stages
You know your organization well—its program execution strength, challenges, potential internal risks in implementing 
a new global solution, and support it will receive. Based on all this, you, along with your project sponsor, and the 
task force or steering committee, must decide on an implementation strategy up front. Having this in place gives 
confidence to the entire team and to others working on the initiative. More important, you can prioritize, plan ahead, 
communicate better, and gain the confidence of the business community early on. Following are two strategies:
Create a global template for accomplishing all your goals at once (big bang adoption).
•฀
Build a global template to be done in stages, aligned to one of the following variables. For 
•฀
example, using the process variable, in the first stage, you may take an order to cash for full 
container load (FCL) ocean freight or an international air exports business scenario.
Process
•฀
Functionality
•฀
Mode of transport
•฀
Commodity handled
•฀
Region or cluster
•฀
Stability of legacy systems
•฀
Line of business
•฀
Business volume
•฀
For more details on big bang adoption, see the section “Implementation.”
Select a product (if you haven’t already)
Your selection committee has a tough task in finalizing a product solution. Our product selection framework is an 
attempt to make your committee’s job a bit easier. The committee needs to consider all factors at the time of product 
selection, including a multimillion dollar, multiyear initiative; a solution to be used for a decade at minimum; 
evolving technology; ever-demanding customers; increasing cost of maintaining the technology landscape; 
possessiveness of users toward existing systems; and stiff competition. The committee must also analyze the impact 
of the new product solution on the remaining technology landscape and ensure that the new product offers all that is 
best in the old systems, whether it be functionality, ease of navigation, or small utilities.
We suggest that your selection team spend sufficient time on this. With choice of the wrong solution come  
all the issues thereafter. The selection committee should refer to various research reports and attend product 
seminars and industry events to collect data on options available in the market. The committee needs to engage 
very closely with solution providers in order to ascertain their vision, road map, focus on innovation, architecture, 
domain understanding, commitment, and financial details. Conducting a conference pilot is a good way to assess 
the solution.

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
46
Learn from previous experience
Does your organization have a mechanism for capturing knowledge gained from previous projects or initiatives—what  
went wrong, and why; how you overcame it; whether you kept it from recurring? If you have captured this information, 
is it made available for reference? Using such information can help you reduce risks to your new initiative. Organize a 
workshop to discuss this knowledge to ensure that mistakes from the past are not repeated and that the right actions 
are built on. If this knowledge is not documented—that is, if you do not have a mechanism for capture in place—your 
task is a difficult one; you must develop a mechanism for this new initiative.
Inventory systems to be replaced
The new solution will replace one or more of the many current applications. These applications have served your 
purposes for several years. They have good features that you may want to retain in the new solution. Most valuable are 
your data. Before you start your new initiative, you must have a clear decommissioning strategy in place, addressing 
when and how they will be decommissioned. The mapping of features to be retained in the new solution and data 
migration decisions should be in place. Interfaces both with internal systems and with the outside world should be 
documented and made available in the new solution as well. Ensure that you have an inventory of every system, 
application, interface, and database, indicating who is currently managing it, and from where, before you start 
implementation of a new solution.
Identify SI partners
Your organization may not have the resources and skills required to implement a new solution. With limited resources, 
implementation will take longer. You therefore need to engage an SI partner to prepare a blueprint; create a global 
template, with rollouts; and support release management. You may decide to engage more than one SI vendor. 
Some organizations opt to have one for the global template and initial rollouts and keep a dedicated one for rollouts 
and perhaps another for release management (this is in addition to the product vendor support you will require for 
creating a global template). Begin identifying SIs with experience in designing, implementing, and rolling out large 
solutions. Focus on the transportation industry and SAP TM competency building. You should give preference to SIs 
with experience implementing SAP TM 9.0, but you do not have many to choose from. You also have the option of 
engaging the SAP AG transportation business unit and consulting team for building a global template.
Select the implementation team
The team involved in building and implementing the global template must have experienced and knowledgeable 
consultants. The implementation team may comprise internal consultants, SAP AG, and the SI partner or 
subcontractors, as SAP TM consultants are in short supply.
Establish project teams
The steering committee identifies project teams, with representatives from sales, customer service, operations, rating, 
planning, carrier and vendor relations teams, purchasing, billing, pricing, costing, accounting, and technology. 
Project team members must have a sound understanding of processes, procedures, deviations, exceptions, reporting 
requirements, and data exchange requirements in their subject area and have been active system users with hands-
on experience and knowledge of the current systems’ capabilities as well as limitations. Members of the steering 
committee and the project sponsor communicate the project’s goals and objectives to the project teams.

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
47
Implementation
Your organization is now ready for SAP TM solution implementation. You have completed most of the preparatory tasks 
discussed. You have followed a scientific framework to select an SAP TM solution. Remember that implementing an 
SAP TM solution is not as simple as implementing a module—it is equivalent to replacing most of your landscape. You 
must therefore stay focused on your organization’s goals and objectives throughout. The slightest loss of focus could 
have an adverse impact on costs, schedule, and benefits as well as invite new risks and challenges to the initiative.
In recent years, SAP TM solution implementations were mainly carried out for a single process, function, or 
mode of transport. But, with integrated SAP 9.0 (SAP, SAP Event Management [SAP EM], SAP Extended Warehouse 
Management [SAP EWM], and SAP Global Trade Services [SAP GTS]), easy integration with business intelligence 
(BI), and ready availability of FICO, we now suggest that you go for big bang adoption. First, take a few representative 
countries from your network, and implement a global template. Upon successful implementation of the template in 
these pilot countries, roll it out in the rest of the countries in your network. Decide on a maximum of two countries, 
chosen by world region, for implementing a global template. We recommend a cap of five countries for pilot global 
template implementation, with the following attributes:
High volume
•฀
High complexity of business
•฀
Maximum usage of existing systems
•฀
Superset of functionalities required to run business
•฀
The aim of the pilot is to
•฀
Verify that the solution meets the business requirements, goals, and objectives set at the start 
•฀
of the project
Generate a yes or no decision on rolling out the solution in other countries
•฀
You have decided to go ahead with implementation. Whatever your strategy, implementation consists of  
these stages:
Discovery and planning
•฀
Design and configuration
•฀
Development
•฀
Testing
•฀
Deployment
•฀
Functional releases and ongoing support
•฀
Let’s discuss each of these in detail.
Discovery and Planning
Discovery and planning activities start during sales discussion, directly with SAP AG or SI partner. The program 
manager is expected to involve all stakeholders (steering committee, project leadership, vendor representatives, 
architecture and product team from a solution provider), get their views, and take note of the constraints and 
limitations to building a detailed implementation project plan. The project sponsor should kick off the project. At the 
kickoff meeting, the sponsor should explain that, as part of the project team, the best resources from every subject 
area have been identified to determine the optimal way to implement the solution. A practical and achievable project 
plan will act as a guideline throughout implementation.

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
48
This stage may last six to ten weeks for every pilot country (we suggest that you run this in parallel), depending on 
the scope. During this time, the implementation team should engage in discussion with the project team and project 
sponsor/steering committee in order to advance understanding of these aspects of the project:
Business domain, model, and logic; to-be processes, with deviations and exceptions; standard 
•฀
operating procedures and events; entities; actors; roles and responsibilities; reporting 
requirements; interfacing needs; areas of difficulty with current systems; and so on
Repository of processes, events, interfaces, workflows and reporting, key performance 
•฀
indicators, and dashboard documents
Vision, expectations, goals, customer needs, and system capabilities as well as other parallel 
•฀
initiatives, if any
Based on the discussions and knowledge gained, the implementation team should
Construct a project plan in agreement with the project team
•฀
Document the process understanding
•฀
Formulate a potential solution (out-of-the-box functionalities of SAP TM, customization, 
•฀
adaptation to best practices of SAP TM)
Underline the gaps between the new system and project scope or areas that will require a 
•฀
work-around
Identify the risks that could push the implementation date, along with steps to mitigate them
•฀
Design and Configuration
In this stage the project team and implementation team translate the requirements into potential configuration options 
in SAP TM. Working closely with the project team, the implementation team should establish configurations and 
implementation strategies that will be used in the development stage of the project. The following steps are involved:
Review the master data.
•฀
Train the project team.
•฀
Demonstrate (and walk through) a possible end-to-end business scenario or process.
•฀
Establish a solution configuration, and create a prototype.
•฀
Validate against (Doc-RBAC, SOD).
•฀
Build help for users by documenting procedures to be followed for each function of the  
•฀
SAP TM solution. Having readily available guidelines will help reduce guesswork. Most 
large-scale implementations face the challenge of losing members of the initial project 
team; therefore, you must insist on comprehensive documented procedures from the 
implementation and project team.
Development
In the development stage, you prepare the system to go live by performing the following activities:
Document items requiring development, as identified in the discovery stage.
•฀
Plan for development, including environment and testing.
•฀

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
49
Migrate data, and validate against requirements.
•฀
Develop a user-training manual.
•฀
Customize for identified gaps to build, deploy, and test features, including new processes, 
•฀
screens, reports, and interfaces.
Configure the system to go live, and load masters and various setups.
•฀
Run a conference room pilot. The implementation team should run an entire to-be process 
•฀
cycle to validate and confirm the design and behavior of the system and whether it meets the 
business’s requirements.
Allow the project team to play with the new system. The project team should use its own data 
•฀
to study and train on the system. The team should also test scenarios in order to verify that the 
system configuration is in accordance with project goals.
Have the implementation and project teams certify for go-live testing.
•฀
Develop training material for end users.
•฀
Testing
The objectives of this stage are to confirm that the new solution is functionally aligned with global template 
requirements, help the implementation team fine-tune configuration, and gain end users’ confidence in the system. 
Some of the key activities to be performed during this stage are as follows:
Identify users for user acceptance testing (UAT).
•฀
Prepare the UAT plan.
•฀
Develop test scenarios.
•฀
Load the master and dynamic data.
•฀
Run system testing.
•฀
Through testing, adjust the configuration in test as well as the live system.
•฀
Establish a cutover strategy.
•฀
Run a final conference room pilot.
•฀
Deliver the end-user training material.
•฀
Deployment
Based on the results from the testing stage, the project team and implementation team make the final go-no-go 
decision. Prior to going live, you need to carry out these tasks:
Train end users, and assess their proficiency.
•฀
Perform final evaluation of the system (project and implementation teams).
•฀
Migrate to the new system.
•฀
Load data, and validate against the old systems.
•฀
Confirm interface functioning.
•฀

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
50
Start using the new system from a specific date.
•฀
Close incomplete transactions in the old systems; do not carry them forward in the new 
•฀
system.
Optimize the new system.
•฀
Functional Releases and Ongoing Support
In this stage, you provide support for the global template that has been implemented. If any new functional 
releases are planned, and the first two stages of global template building have already been carried out, then the 
remaining stages (development, testing, deployment of new functionalities) are managed by the implementation 
team, if available, or retrograded by rollout teams. If the duration of implementation is increased, and both the 
implementation and rollout teams have moved on from the project, support is then best handled by the release 
management team or an ongoing support team.
Rollout
Having successfully implemented the global template in a handful of pilot countries, in mature markets that carry out 
the most complex, high-volume business in your network, you should be satisfied with your choice of solution and 
implementation methodology and your organizational preparedness for such a large transformation. You now want to 
increase your satisfaction by rolling out this solution in other countries.
Rollout consists of these high-level stages
Country preparation
•฀
Local adaptation
•฀
Realization
•฀
Final preparation
•฀
Going live
•฀
Hypercare
•฀
As you approach the go-live of the global template in pilot countries, you need to start planning for rollouts in 
the next set of countries identified for rollout. The first step is to create a rollout manual based on your experience 
in the pilot. It is advisable that you share these guidelines with all the countries so that they have sufficient time for 
preparation. The manual should include
Details on activities required during rollout
•฀
An indicative project plan, a cutover plan, and a plan for hypercare
•฀
Project organization, including rollout partners, along with roles and responsibilities
•฀
Checklists for overall readiness assessment of individual countries
•฀
Based on your knowledge from the global template implementation, you may want to revisit your rollout strategy. 
You may want to consider these steps as you formulate your strategy:
Categorize countries in your network based on type of ownership. You may have your own operations in some 
countries, joint operations in other countries, and agents appointed in still others. You may have dedicated agents 
or agents that are not exclusive to your organization. In the case of nonexclusive agents, you need not deploy your 
global template, as they are not obliged to follow your processes or accounting procedures in their totality. Further 
categorize countries based on their volume (low, medium, high) (see Figure 6-4).

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
51
Analyze complexities of doing business in each region. Now, you have a list of countries categorized by region, 
ownership type, volume, and complexity (see Figures 6-5 and 6-6).
Figure 6-4. Categorizing country based on ownership type and volume for global template rollout
Figure 6-5. Global rollout template classification based on ownership type, volume and complexity

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
52
In consultation with your rollout partner(s), agree on timelines and resources required for 
•฀
rollout for each country.
Form clusters based on the number of countries in which you operate (see Figure 
•฀
6-7).
Figure 6-6. Region-wise global rollout template classification based on ownership type, volume, and complexity
Figure 6-7. Cluster formation

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
53
Aim at completing all rollouts in approximately 18 months; do not form more than  
•฀
three clusters.
Your first cluster should include countries in all the regions with high volume and  
•฀
high complexity.
You may also consider some medium-size countries with high complexity in cluster 1.
•฀
Your cluster 2 should include countries with medium volume and complexity.
•฀
You may also consider some low-volume countries with medium complexity in cluster 2.
•฀
All other countries should fall under cluster 3.
•฀
Once the clusters are formed, create waves within them.
•฀
Clusters 1 and 2 may have three to four waves each.
•฀
Planning should be managed at each cluster level.
•฀
Waves are formed based on preparedness of countries and on geography, so that the rollout 
•฀
and project teams spend a minimum of time traveling. This will result in multiple go-live 
dates, with each wave having an individual date.
Decide on whether the rollout teams will physically travel to the location or carry out the 
•฀
rollout from a central location, to which representatives of small-volume countries and 
dedicated agents will travel for training and from which they will subsequently receive 
assistance. Following are the four options for rollout:
The entire team visits the country for implementation.
•฀
Part of the team visits the country for implementation (team members have multiple skills).
•฀
Members of project teams assemble at a central location, receive training, and subsequently 
•฀
carry out rollout in their country, with support provided from one of the regional locations.
Rollouts are carried out from a regional/central location.
•฀
In the end, you will have a list of countries by region, volume, complexity, type of ownership, 
•฀
cluster, wave, and type of approach for rollout (see Figure 6-8).
Figure 6-8. Rollout plan

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
54
Create a program organization to carry out rollouts. We recommend a three-tier structure 
•฀
under the central leadership, made up of the central leadership, or global team; regional team 
and cluster; and country teams (see Figure 6-9).
Figure 6-9. Three-tier program organization structure
Figure 6-10. Organization-wise responsibility chart
Every tier should be made responsible for the success of the rollouts, with consistent 
•฀
contribution required. We have seen some small to midsize countries in want of the global or 
regional team’s attention and involvement. You can use the responsibility chart illustrated in 
Figure 6-10 for planning and charting responsibilities.

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
55
The responsibilities of key roles are shown in Figure 6-11.
Figure 6-11. Key roles responsibility chart
Following are some other considerations:
•฀
Localization: Your rollout teams will come across many local requirements in every country. 
Here are some suggestions:
Gather to assess and consolidate local requirements at the rollout site.
•฀
Share local requirements with the cluster, regional, and global teams.
•฀
Obtain approvals from the change management board.
•฀
Implement localizations that are legally, fiscally, and physically required.
•฀
Validate localizations once they are built.
•฀
•฀
Retrograde: You may have functional releases planned after the first stage of the rollout 
of the global template. In such cases, retrograde rollouts need to be performed in those 
countries. In some large-scale implementations, you may have three to four retrogrades in 
just two to three years.
•฀
Industrialized approach: Gone are the days when rollouts went on for many years. In today’s 
world a suggested timeline for completing rollouts after successful implementation of the pilot 
is no more than one-and-a-half years if your operation is in 180 to 200 countries. How do you 
deal with this constraint? The answer is to build an industrialized approach. This requires 
rollout partners with the necessary tools, assets, framework, methodology, resources, and 
experience.
•฀
Language strategy: Language plays an important role in global rollouts. You need to have a 
clear understanding of the language requirements for every rollout site and communicate 
these to your rollout partners so that they engage consultants with the requisite language 
skills. The rollout team should have a minimum of one key consultant for language strategy, 
which is needed for training and various types of documentation (business, legal, and so on).

CHAPTER 6 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION, ROLLOUT, AND MAINTENANCE OF SAP TM
56
•฀
E-learning: Even with classroom and on-the-job training in place, it is important to make 
maximum use of an e-learning platform for competency building. E-learning provides 
flexibility, offering material that is easy to update, easy to deliver, and cost-effective. We 
suggest that you have a dedicated team that is responsible for developing an e-learning 
strategy for building and delivering e-content.

Release Management
We hope you have partners who can scale as you need on short notice. In this phase, you are responsible for planning, 
scheduling, and controlling the building, testing, and deployment of releases, including new functionalities required 
by the business, while protecting the integrity of the global template. Discuss this with your partners, and agree on 
schedule, deliveries, and expectations.
Figure 6-13 presents a summary of a release management strategy in which release packages are built, installed, 
tested, and deployed.

Your partners should keep you updated by sharing weekly status reports on progress made against the plan and 
any issues that may affect delivery, costs, milestones, and quality.
Project Organization and Locations
Your release management team should be available at minimum 24/6. Essentially, this means that you have teams 
available in different areas by providing support. Depending on your organization’s presence, you may choose to have 
one team each in Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, and North America (NA).
Summary
Users of new solutions, such as SAP TM, want to understand both basic features and the more complex capabilities 
of the system. User proficiency is an important issue that the project sponsor’s task force needs to attend to on an 
ongoing basis. The success or failure of a new solution depends on how quickly and accurately the user community 
gets to know the system and exploit its potential in their daily use. User turnover should be addressed through regular 
trainings for new users. In addition, it is advisable to have more users trained than required. In the absence of proper 
and continual training, users will become frustrated, having to create work-arounds to get their work done.
Your new solution will only be as good as the investment you continue to make in it. We recommend a system 
review at least once a year to identify areas for improvement through version upgrades, new interfaces, additional 
modules, more efficient processes, and additional user training. A commitment to this process will enable you to 
optimize your return on investment, while extending your capabilities to help you achieve even greater success.

Team Composition and Skill Matrix 
Required for TM Engagement: How to 
Build Competency in TM
In this chapter, we will consider the following:
The importance of team composition for SAP TM projects
•฀
Roles and their skill sets
•฀
Team composition for all phases (implementation to support)
•฀
How to ramp up team and build competency
•฀
Ways to retain SAP TM consultants
•฀
In Chapter 6, we discussed various approaches to successfully implementing SAP TM. You may choose any of these 
methods, depending on the size, business needs, challenges, and vision of your organization. Success also depends on 
commitment from leadership, preparedness, and the systems integrator (SI) partner. Key, however, is the team chosen for 
implementation. Team composition is therefore very important. You need teams with different skill sets for the different 
phases: implementation, rollout, and support. Because SAP TM version 9.0 is relatively new to the market, obtaining 
experienced consultants is a major challenge. Project sponsors are currently struggling to get SAP TM functional and 
technical consultants on board, but this will change as ongoing implementations bring experienced resources into the 
market. The team should have a sufficient number of logistics domain consultants with a comprehensive knowledge  
and understanding of logistic processes and the ability to validate business requirements, exceptions, and  
deviations—consultants who can not only expedite business process mapping, but also offer error-free deliverables. 
Doing everything in-house is not a good idea. You should engage qualified SIs to provide experienced resources 
for the various roles required. You should also engage SAP AG’s transportation business unit while designing the 
solution and aligning requirements with their future road map. You need to form three teams internally: one to focus 
on strategy, a second to guide and monitor business and technical architecture, and a third to manage the program. 
It is advisable that you break the program into several projects of manageable size. Many projects can be undertaken 
simultaneously or in sequence, depending on the vision and road map decided on. It is also recommended that you 
retain architecture roles in-house. However, if your firm does not have competent architects, you should never bring 
in architects from a company/source that you have engaged to carry out implementation. It is always better to have 
your architecture designed and monitored by you. This will ensure that your architecture best practices are followed. 
Furthermore, you should keep your business architecture in your custody because your business is yours—you know 
what makes it different from your competitors, your unique sales proposition (USP), and your company secrets. You 
best understand what affects your business. To derive maximum benefit from your investment, the business and 
technology architecture teams must be part of one group.

Your SI partner for the existing SAP landscape may be the best choice in terms of timelines, quality, and cost 
but may not necessarily be the most appropriate one for implementing SAP TM. Few SI vendors have a track record 
of implementing SAP TM, including some leading ones. In contrast, a number of boutiques have invested time and 
energy over the past years, have gained an almost complete understanding of what SAP TM can do, and have built 
integrations with other systems and assets that can expedite implementation. In fact, these shops can set up a pilot 
demonstrating your scenario in a few weeks’ time. Experience is one of the criteria for selection; other factors that you 
should consider before engaging an SI vendor are as follows:
Does the SI vendor have sufficient understanding of a logistics domain?
•฀
How many trained, experienced resources does the SI vendor have?
•฀
Does the SI vendor have a lab or environment where its resources have built or are  
•฀
building scenarios?
How closely is the SI vendor working with the SAP AG transportation unit? Is the SI vendor 
•฀
building any solutions jointly, or is it part of SAP’s custom development initiative?
Has the SI vendor invested in hosting SAP TM solutions?
•฀
The answers to these questions can help you choose the right SI partner.
Team Composition for Implementation
A SAP TM implementation program is different from implementing SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (SAP ERP)  
modules because SAP TM is not a module, but a complete mini-ERP that addresses the core functions of the 
logistics business. Migrating to SAP TM as a core system therefore requires the highest level of commitment 
from leadership and an organizational-level readiness for transformation in both technology and process areas. 
Process standardization is key to optimizing processes, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and removing personal 
dependencies; in addition, documented processes act as a reference guide for every individual in the organization. 
The standardization of processes is the first step in getting ready for such a major initiative. Standardized processes, 
with due consideration of local needs, such as taxation, border-crossing regulations, and country/product-specific 
documentation, leads to easy blueprinting for SAP TM. Given these considerations, and the importance attached to 
such a program, we present here recommendations for roles at the corporate and program level.
Corporate-Level Roles
At the corporate level of the organization implementing SAP TM, the following roles are suggested: 
Project Sponsor: The chief operating officer (COO), or head of the business unit, generally sponsors SAP 
TM implementation programs. A business case detailing vision, goals and objectives, scope, tentative timelines, 
success criteria, proposed investment, areas of improvement, opportunities for growth, and return on investment 
are prepared. A detailed study may be undertaken to build a meaningful business case. The project sponsor 
presents the business case to the board or owners, who must approve it in order for the program to go forward. 
It is the responsibility of the project sponsor to deliver the value assured the business in the business case. The 
sponsor resolves issues at the organizational level, as well as any external impacts, to ensure smooth running of the 
program. The sponsor must also guide the program team. Other duties include monitoring project costs, schedule, 
and key success factors and participating in pricing and terms negotiations with software, consulting, SI, hardware, 
communication, and training vendors. Monthly to quarterly reviews of the program by the sponsor are suggested to 
monitor the health of the program.

CHAPTER 7 ■ TEAM COMPOSITION AND SKILL MATRIX REQUIRED FOR TM ENGAGEMENT: HOW TO BUILD COMPETENCY IN TM
61
Steering Committee: The project sponsor should appoint steering committee members upon receiving approval 
of the business case. The steering committee comprises identified leaders from various functions, such as process 
engineering, procurement, risk and compliance, quality control, business development, customer service, strategic 
planning, budgeting, and technology. The chief information officer (CIO) generally heads the committee, who reports 
to the project sponsor on a regular basis. The purpose of the committee is to guide program organization and help 
the program run smoothly by providing resolutions and removing dependencies. The committee is responsible for 
devising a vendor selection framework, selecting vendors and contracting with them, monitoring the progress of the 
program, and guiding the program team. The committee is also responsible for the budget and hence must assess 
spending versus achievement of objectives. It is advisable that the committee meets once a month, at minimum,  
to take stock of the program. 
Enterprise Architect: A group of business and technology architects headed by an enterprise architect plays 
an important role in a program of this size. Business architects deal with business changes and their impact, areas of 
improvement, opportunities to automate, and process standardization. Technology architects ensure that principles 
of design are followed and that architecture guidelines are adhered to. They offer understanding of the existing 
technology landscape and planned transformation as well as the vision detailed in the business case. Both groups, 
under the leadership of the enterprise architect, should ensure implementation of enterprise architecture through the 
life cycle of the SAP TM program. As mentioned earlier, it is in the interest of the organization to have this group staffed 
internally. In cases in which the group requires external resources, they should be sourced from vendors that are not 
assigned an implementation or rollout task. It is also advisable that a detailed review of the architecture framework of 
industry experts be undertaken, as new technology platforms, offerings, and models are evolving rapidly. 
Program Manager (owner): The program manager (owner) serves as single point of contact (SPOC) for the 
program. Preferably, the program manager (owner) should have experience managing large projects in the area 
of logistics or supply chain management. Experience delivering large SAP programs is a plus. The project sponsor 
should appoint the program manager (owner) while the steering committee is being formed. The program manager 
(owner) creates scope documents for appointing vendors, logically breaks scope into manageable projects, 
identifies the risks associated with the program, and writes a mitigation plan. Other duties include creating change 
management and critical resource plans; identifying dependencies; and devising a program organization structure, 
measurement criteria, an induction plan, and a reporting mechanism. It is also the responsibility of the program 
manager (owner) to sign off on meaningful deliverables received from vendors. 
Whether it be a pilot, a partial implementation, or an organizational-level implementation, these roles are 
necessary at the corporate level to achieve success with your program.
Program-Level Roles
Based on our experience with TM engagement, we suggest the following program-level roles for implementation. 
Their numbers will depend on the size and scope of implementation. 
Program Manager (SI): The program manager (SI) serves as single point of contact (SPOC) for the program 
from the SI side. Preferably, the program manager (SI) should have experience managing large projects in the area 
of logistics or supply chain management. Experience delivering large SAP programs is a plus. The project sponsor 
should appoint the program manager (SI) during the solution-building stage. The program manager (SI) must ensure 
the delivery of the scope agreed on, as outlined in the statement of work (SOW). The program manager (SI) works 
closely with the program manager (owner) to stay aligned and resolve issues at the program level. The program 
manager (SI) reports progress to the program manager (owner), who in turn presents it to management. Other 
duties include getting the project milestone completion signoff from the program manager (owner) or the steering 
committee, as stated in the contract.
Project Manager: The project manager develops and monitors the project plan. The project manager is also 
responsible for status reporting; risk management; escalation of issues that cannot be resolved by his or her team; and 
generally making sure the project is delivered within the confines of the budget, on schedule, and in accordance with 
the scope agreed on. You will need project managers for every project identified as part of this large transformation 
program. You can have a mix of them, staffed in-house and onboarded from SI or other vendors. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ TEAM COMPOSITION AND SKILL MATRIX REQUIRED FOR TM ENGAGEMENT: HOW TO BUILD COMPETENCY IN TM
62
Logistics Domain Consultant (SME): This role is vital to the success of SAP TM implementation. A consultant 
with a few years’ experience in the logistics industry appreciates difficult areas and the challenges faced by different 
roles within a logistics company. He or she can therefore play a large part in putting together the right solutions. 
A logistics domain consultant with experience implementing SAP TM is preferable; however, a consultant with 
experience implementing TM products other than SAP TM can also meet your needs. In fact, these types of 
consultants can be assets, as they know the good and bad sides of implementing other products; this knowledge can 
be leveraged. The way the industry is organized, it would be difficult to find an individual with a strong understanding 
of all areas of the business. Some consultants may have excellent knowledge of ocean freight but no experience 
with airfreight or value-added services. Consultants with a background in road transportation may not have the 
required understanding of global trade management. Therefore, based on your implementation strategy, you may 
elect to engage logistics domain consultants by line of business or by business process. You can have a combination 
of consultants—some from your organization, others from SI or consulting organizations. It is advisable to select, 
at minimum, 50 percent of the SME team from in-house. Consultants chosen from SI or business-consulting 
organizations bring varied experience and the best practices followed by competitors/industry leaders. By conducting 
workshops, a logistics domain consultant can easily connect with business users to capture key performance 
indicators, success criteria, roles played by actors in the ecosystems, data exchange requirements, cross-border 
requirements, compliance needs, and volume of transactions. The logistics domain consultant is also expected to 
provide recommendations for process optimization. Moreover, a logistics domain consultant is a process consultant; 
therefore, experience working with business process–modeling or –mapping tools is desirable. 
SAP TM Functional Consultant: A functional consultant needs to have strong SAP TM knowledge and hands-on 
experience. The consultant should have a good understanding of Business Rule Framework plus (BRFPlus). It will 
be advantageous to engage a consultant who has experience with other SAP modules, such as SAP Logistics and 
Execution (SAP LE), SAP ERP Sales and Distribution (SAP SD), and SAP Material Management (SAP MM). Logistics 
domain knowledge is desirable as well. The main responsibilities of a SAP TM functional consultant are to map 
business requirements in SAP TM and to configure systems that meet business requirements. 
SAP TM Technical Consultant: The SAP TM technical consultant must have strong knowledge of advanced 
business application programming (ABAP) and hands-on experience with the SAP TM ecosystem. The technical 
consultant also needs to have a good understanding of the following areas:
•฀
Business Object Processing Framework (BOPF): Used to create a service interface based on 
a business object structure at design time. BOPF is considered the heart of SAP TM’s technical 
area, and the SAP TM technical consultant should have good knowledge of it. 
•฀
Floor Plan Manager (FPM): A user interface that interacts with the process control framework 
and the strategies for adjusting the process step sequence; adds additional, customer-specific 
steps to support SAP TM business strategies, while creating conditions and decision points to 
influence business strategies in SAP TM.
•฀
SAP NetWeaver Business Client (NWBC).
•฀
Business Rule Framework plus (BRFPlus).
SAP Process Integration (PI) Consultant: SAP PI has to connect SAP TM with SAP ERP Central Component 
(SAP ECC) and other systems and third-party products used in your organization by vendors, customers, and 
border agencies. The SAP PI consultant builds these interfaces. SAP TM also requires interfacing with SAP 
Event Management (SAP EM), SAP Global Trade Services (SAP GTS), business intelligence (BI), and warehouse 
management systems (WMS). A SAP PI consultant with hands-on experience, preferably in supply chain execution 
and collaboration systems interfacing, should be brought on board. 
SAP Basis Consultant: The SAP Basis consultant handles SAP TM system administration, including installation 
(SAP R/3, SAP NetWeaver and NetWeaver components, SAP Solution Manager [SolMan]), configuration (printers, 
remote function call [RFC], SAP Transport Management System [SAP STMS]), administration (user, client, backup), 
and maintenance (monitoring servers, background jobs, and system performance; avoiding bottlenecks). The SAP 
Basis consultant is responsible for ensuring the smooth running of the system, with high performance. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ TEAM COMPOSITION AND SKILL MATRIX REQUIRED FOR TM ENGAGEMENT: HOW TO BUILD COMPETENCY IN TM
63
SAP Finance and Controlling (FICO) Consultant: If you are a SAP shop, and FICO is already implemented,  
your financial settings may already be configured. The SAP FICO consultant is needed to configure financial settings 
in the SAP ECC system. SAP TM is integrated with SAP ECC for managing customer receipts and vendor payments 
through accounts receivable (AR), accounts payable (AP), general ledger (GL), cost center, and profit center. 
SAP Material Management (MM) Consultant: The SAP MM consultant creates a service framework for the 
system, thereby enabling vendor invoice settlement. This consultant is required only if you do not have the necessary 
configuration in place at the time of SAP TM implementation. Generally, an organization that is already using SAP 
ECC may have these configurations in place. 
SAP Event Management (EM) Consultant: Event management is one of the most desired functionalities. Your 
customers rate your service based on the maturity of your event management capabilities. Correct settings are a must. 
Hence, an EM consultant is needed. 
Global trade management (GTM) Consultant: It is advisable that you bring on board a GTM consultant who 
can configure GTM functionalities. Global trade settings must be carried out with the utmost care, because the 
ramifications of incorrect settings are severe and may mean loss of business or the incurrence of penalties. 
Legacy System Expert: The involvement of legacy system experts is vital for decommissioning, as during data 
migration, you may lose wealth preserved for many years in the form of a special requirement. This role is important 
in terms of interfacing and data migration as well. 
Quality Assurance Consultant: You should staff this position internally, as you know your business better than 
anyone. Should you decide to engage with an external vendor to run your test factory, make sure you have found a 
vendor experienced with both the test factory and the logistics domain. Testing and quality control are important 
not only because SAP TM 9.0 is new, but also because it interfaces with most of your landscape as well as outside it. 
Ensure that batch processes are running as expected and that all the interfaces, functionalities, and, more important, 
custom-built functionalities are working. 
Some of the resources discussed here may be needed on a part-time basis and when required, as indicated in 
the program plan. It is recommended that the entire program team be situated at a single site for better collaboration. 
Depending on the success of Implementation and subsequent support phase, you may want to revisit your rollout 
plan. The implementation team conducts workshops to share solution details, architecture aspects, environment, 
configuration, user setup, and documentation with rollout leadership. 
Team Composition for Rollout and Release Management
The corporate team continues on throughout the rollouts. It is good practice to retain a few key resources from the 
implementation team for the initial rollouts. These resources can act as mentors to the rollout teams. The steering 
committee appoints one or more rollout partners and release management partners, depending on the number of 
sites and time allotted. 
Rollout Team
Rollout partners are best enlisted toward the last phase of implementation of the global template. They should 
shadow the implementation team during the warranty stage at the first site.
You need all the skills of the implementation team to carry out the rollouts. However, you do not need the 
same number of resources. Retain consultants with multiple skill sets. Also, the competency level required 
for implementation is higher than that needed for rollout. Rollout consultants should have knowledge of the 
implementing country or site-specific localization. Different countries have different legal and statutory requirements; 
these must be addressed while rolling out the standard template. Forms and documents may also be required in the 
local language(s) and format. 
If you can spare a few members of the implementation team for rollouts, you will soon become self-sufficient. 
However, it is not always possible to contribute to the rollout teams from corporate or regional teams. From your side, 
you must arrange for all support at the site to assist the team carrying out the rollout. It is the responsibility of the 
steering committee to form a local rollout support team, composed of location manager, location Internet technology 
single point of contact (IT SPOC), local process champions, power users, and key business users as testers.

CHAPTER 7 ■ TEAM COMPOSITION AND SKILL MATRIX REQUIRED FOR TM ENGAGEMENT: HOW TO BUILD COMPETENCY IN TM
64
Rollout team members, with the exception of the project manager, are expected to conduct training in their 
respective area/domain for power users and key associates identified at the site. The rollout team is responsible 
for data migration; demonstrating end-to-end scenarios, as indicated in the global template; identifying and 
documenting new functionalities; configuring localization; and conducting training. 
The rollout manager is responsible for rolling out the global template at sites identified by the steering 
committee. Rollouts at large sites may require a dedicated team; however, a rollout team can also be deployed to work 
at many small, less complex sites. These teams may perform rollouts simultaneously. The best practice in such a case 
is to situate key resources from the small sites at a central location, train them, and subsequently guide them remotely 
while they perform rollout at their respective sites.
Release Management Team
It is good practice to have two different vendors engaged for rollout and release management. The release 
management team supports the rollout team, which shares new requirements identified and issues faced during 
rollout. The release team resolves issues, either alone or with the help of the SAP AG development team. The steering 
committee prioritizes new requirements. The release team carries out those requirements in need of immediate 
development. A few requirements are considered for rollout at later stage, and the remaining ones are approved or not 
considered. Newly developed functionalities are retrofitted for sites where the rollout team has acted by the release 
management team. 
The release management team is best enlisted toward the last stage of implementation of the global template. 
This team should further shadow the implementation team during the warranty stage at the first site. The release 
management team may start shadowing and subsequently take over as the prime team. In this way, team members 
can learn the system and how issues are resolved and build understanding of the framework, the product 
development kit, and documentation. 
The release management team should also have all the skills required for implementation of the SAP TM 
solution. The team can perform most of its tasks from a remote location, except in cases in which certain team 
members must travel to sites to conduct training on major releases. The release management team is also expected 
to support multiple rollouts simultaneously. It is advisable to have two or three different release management teams 
supporting countries in the same region and time zone. You can also achieve optimization by overlapping team 
availability in different time zones. The release management team is headed by the release manager and supported by 
a leader for the respective release teams.
Team Composition for Support
The support management team takes over for the release management team. The vendor may be different or the 
same. It is not recommended that you find support internally, as SI vendors bring to the table best practices, tools, 
and assets that will help optimize the support resources. Also, these being 24/7 requirements, SI vendors have the 
advantage of leveraging shared resources and teams from low-cost countries. 
It is suggested that the support management team include SAP TM functional and technical consultants, SAP 
Basis consultants, and SAP PI consultants.
SAP TM Team Ramp-Up and Competency-Building Plan
SAP TM implementation is a major transformational project for 3PLs and requires a great many experienced and 
trained SAP TM resources to manage implementation and multiple rollouts and provide support. SAP TM 9.0 is the 
latest and most comprehensive version to date and was released for general availability in the third quarter of 2012.  
As discussed previously, because SAP TM 9.0 is relatively new, availability of resources with SAP TM 9.0 skills 
represents a major challenge. This challenge can be addressed by implementing a ramp-up and competency-building 
plan. We believe that SAP TM consultants must have sound knowledge of freight forwarding and logistics in addition 

CHAPTER 7 ■ TEAM COMPOSITION AND SKILL MATRIX REQUIRED FOR TM ENGAGEMENT: HOW TO BUILD COMPETENCY IN TM
65
to SAP TM skills. We propose a joint capability development strategy with four levels of maturity, from E1 (beginner) 
to E4 (expert). Furthermore, it is suggested that these resources be involved in different stages of the project/initiative 
life cycle, depending on their maturity. These are some ways to build the team: 
Category 1: Bring on board internal associates who are working in business areas but 
who are IT savvy and keen to learn new product technology. Training in technology 
should be given. Such resources bring domain understanding, an important asset. With 
this knowledge, they can grasp SAP TM faster and be deployed for process mapping, 
requirement gathering, and documentation.
Category 2: Identify internal IT resources and competent power users (working with other 
SAP modules) who are willing to make the move to SAP TM technology, and train them in 
SAP TM.
Category 3: Engage experienced consultants who are working with SAP TM (and other SAP 
modules), and train them in SAP TM.
Category 4: Recruit SAP TM resources directly from the market to augment teams. This can 
meet your immediate requirements. However, using onboard resources from the market 
can be costly. Consultants may be hired on a contract basis, but this is expensive and a 
relatively risky proposition. The opportunity to build knowledge is also lost when you hire 
only contractors.
We recommend following a competency-building plan for associates joining the project. Based on their 
background and category, individuals would undergo the following training as applicable: 
E1-A: SAP technology overview and navigation for category 1 resources.
E1-B: Internal transportation domain training covering specific SAP TM processes (one 
week) for category 2 resources. Senior members from various functional areas may conduct 
this training. 
E2: SAP TM 9.0 product training conducted internally for categories 1, 2, and 3. 
Resources trained at the E2 level may be used as shadow resources for support or release 
management.
E3: SAP TM 9.0 product training conducted by either a SAP AG training center or internal 
faculty identified as skilled trainers. Training will be three to four weeks in duration, 
cover all product features, and offer hands-on experience with SAP TM functionality 
and integration needs. This will necessitate the creation of an internal environment and 
scenarios for demonstrating and practicing the information. E3-level resources can be 
engaged in release management.
E4: Consultants with E3-level certification and experience with release management/ 
implementation of a major release (internally or with SI organizations) should be given 
implementation tasks, such as requirement review, configuration, blueprinting, and 
realization. Such consultants, after an implementation, can be categorized at the E4 level of 
competency.

Retention of TM Consultants
Because of strong demand and weak supply, retention of the SAP TM consultant is a major challenge for user 
organizations. Skilled resources are rare, and implementations that are approved and underway, offering jobs with 
higher compensation, rewards, and growth opportunities are common. With due consideration of this scenario,  
an organization needs to develop a comprehensive plan to ensure retention of its skilled SAP TM consultants.  
Cross-modular exposure to enhance skills is one solution. Nomination to different training programs to update skills 
and facilitate job rotation and rationalizing compensation are some other ways to retain good SAP TM consultants. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ TEAM COMPOSITION AND SKILL MATRIX REQUIRED FOR TM ENGAGEMENT: HOW TO BUILD COMPETENCY IN TM

Summary
SAP TM implementation is a major transformational project for 3PLs and requires a great many experienced and 
trained SAP TM resources to manage implementation and multiple rollouts and provide support. However, because 
SAP TM 9.0 is relatively new, availability of skilled and experienced resource represents a major challenge. Therefore, 
for realizing early return on investment and project success, you need to create a comprehensive ramp-up and 
competency-building plan to address this challenge. You should put together a mix of resources with logistics domain 
knowledge and SAP TM experience. Also, doing everything in-house is not a good idea. You need to engage qualified 
SI vendors to provide experienced resources for various roles. Engaging SAP AG’s transportation business unit while 
designing the solution and aligning requirements with their future road map is also suggested. 
Your transformation initiative may affect the way you will deal with your customers and vendors going forward. 
This must be managed with sensitivity. The next chapter deals with how to manage this impact.

Transformation Impact of SAP TM 
Implementation
In this chapter, we will cover the following:
The role of communication in the journey of transformation
•฀
Who and what are affected, and how and when impact occurs
•฀
How to manage affected processes, people, and systems
•฀
How companies are using SAP TM for transformation
•฀
Previously, we discussed using SAP TM as a solution for meeting the growing business needs of 3PLs and 
approaches to deploying the solution across your organization. SAP TM implementation is a major transformational 
project that is expected to render the benefits envisioned at the time of its inception. Some of the common benefits, 
such as cost savings, improved processes, and accurate and timely information may be realized, but it is essential 
that you evaluate whether the benefits projected while justifying the business case to senior management have been 
achieved. Therefore, there is first a need to assess how the transformation will affect your organization and key factors 
for ensuring that the transformation is smooth.
Communication is a key to success. Your transformation initiative may have an impact on the way you will deal 
with your customers and vendors. Therefore, any changes made as a result of the new model, systems, processes,  
or strategy must be communicated clearly and at an appropriate time and be in agreement with your views. The other 
group that is affected the most is your employees. Make certain that every employee to be influenced by such changes, 
irrespective of designation, role, location, seniority, or skill set, is made aware of the changes, and communicate this 
information up front. Conduct workshops on the transformation initiative. People must gain some understanding 
of why the change in strategy or culture is needed and what the impact on them will be, in particular shifts in roles, 
responsibilities, location, and teams. Any change is bound to be seen as political, and as people will be critical in 
carrying out your firm’s initiative, clear communication with them at appropriate times and intervals is suggested. 
People will generally perceive changes negatively in the beginning. This is when, besides a central team managing the 
change, respective managers must actively contribute toward it. To realize benefits from such a major investment, an 
integrated technology, process and awareness of people’s needs are essential. Consistent behavior and willingness to 
sacrifice uniqueness for gaining standardization also prove helpful.

CHAPTER 8 ■ TRANSFORMATION IMPACT OF SAP TM IMPLEMENTATION

SAP TM Transformational Impact
The following sections deal with the impact of SAP TM implementation on processes, people, and systems.
Processes
You have now implemented new processes informed by best practices. These processes may differ greatly from your 
old processes. We hope you have trained your resources on these new processes. Teams that have worked together for 
years become used to doing things a certain way. They may perform a lot of tasks the way they were performing them 
before, purely out of habit. This can lead to confusion, delays, issues with reconciliation, missed connections, and 
incorrect routes and may result in service-level failure or penalties. Newer processes are supposed to ensure that  
such lapses are identified and corrected; however, inadequate training and lack of audits can result in such errors. 
One-time training is not going to help. You need to make a provision for a series of trainings and create innovative 
ways of training. We hope you have an e-learning platform on which these new processes, or any changes to 
processes, are available. Contents on an e-learning platform should be simple, easy to access, and self-explanatory. 
Offer a means of accessing e-learning, and conduct audits to assess the effectiveness of these trainings. 
Collaborative ways of sharing information can help you achieve success much faster. Make use of some of the 
collaboration platforms at an organizational level. Use networking tools to chat, share information, and provide online 
help. Create teams of process consultants or champions at various levels (global, regional, country). These teams 
should give additional assistance with new processes.
Some of the new or changed processes may require modification in infrastructure, such as scanners, conveyor 
belts, sorting machines, network, connectivity, and so on. Make certain that the infrastructure needed is in place 
before announcing go-live dates for new processes. Also, perform testing and training to ensure that the system 
behaves as desired. Full or partial automation of processes means fewer manual tasks. This may result in fewer 
resources required and a higher volume of work performed in less time. However, you may not want to let go of the 
additional resources. They have been your assets up until now. They have an understanding of your business, clients, 
and processes. We suggest you retrain and absorb them in some other area of the business.
With your changed processes, you need to keep in mind the most important business partners: the customer 
and the carriers. Your new processes afford improved integration with these partners, giving them visibility of 
shipments, actionable reports, and improved workflow through load tendering, communication, electronic payment 
and reconciliation of invoices, and many other new features. To achieve all such benefits, changes have to be made at 
both your end and theirs. You have carried out the required changes at your end. Now, you must communicate clearly 
with your partners what they need to change at theirs for mutual benefit. Make sure you are asking for the minimum 
required, as they are not obliged to make changes. Also, perform comprehensive testing of changes made before 
starting any new process or exchange of information.
People
People are your biggest asset. They should own this transformation. They have been with your organization and have 
helped it grow. Your efforts toward the modernization, simplification, and rationalization of systems and processes 
should be seen by them as their initiative and of great benefit, elevating their career and widening their horizons.  This 
transformation should bring positive change to the work environment. The people aspect of change management is 
more critical than the strategic or project management aspect.
People in your organization were using different legacy systems for data entry, as no one system was available 
everything. SAP TM enables multiple functionalities, and data entry is done in one application rather than using multiple 
applications. SAP TM implementation brings about a radical change in how people operate and in the overall working 
environment. Implementing change is an uphill battle. Because people are comfortable doing things the old way, they 
are often resistant to change. They may see change as threatening. It is the responsibility of the transformation sponsor 
or chief executive officer (CEO) of your organization to be clear and to share information up front about the planned 
change and its impact. This can shift the perception of change from negative to positive. This transformation should

71
be seen as an organization-wide mission. The backing of executives and management support are thus critical 
success factors. Executive-level management should come out with a visualization of the project’s success that should 
be cascaded throughout the company. 
It is important to understand people’s thinking about the change. People using the system and performing 
relevant processes should own this transformation. They should be involved early on in the process and also be 
told clearly what role they are going to play and what is expected of them. It is our experience that kickoff is positive 
when the channel of communication is opened early on. Informing the people about the change as early as possible 
will give them time to accept it. Communicating change requires expressing briefly and modestly the benefits of the 
change. Communication should not be a set of one-time messages but rather a series of campaigns that begin early 
on and that do not stop until implementation is a demonstrable success. Those who will be affected by the change 
will need evidence that the solution is the right one—that it will solve the problem, that it is feasible, and that it can be 
implemented. When developing a communication plan, consider all those who will be affected, from the board room 
and senior executives to the operations manager and dockworker.
You can help people who are going to be affected in several ways. The project sponsor and project leadership 
must be preemptive regarding worry and destructive energy. Target relevant groups by sending motivational 
messages, or implement an awareness-building campaign. Furthermore, start discussing with employees the future 
change on the company’s web site. You could include frequently asked questions and provide opportunity for 
employees to post their queries and worries. This would also give you the chance to learn what are employees’ major 
concerns. You should consider these with an open mind. You may decide to change your approach a bit or convince 
people with rational facts, to their satisfaction.
Change cannot be achieved without participation from your firm’s people. They should be involved and willing 
and, more important, know how to perform the changed processes and work on the new system. Both process 
training and system training are a must. Lack of adequate training can result in data errors, wrong operations, 
incomplete capture of data, incorrect process steps, and so on. Cleaning up the mess means redoing a lot of work and 
increased costs, in addition to customer and partner dissatisfaction. You need to provide e-learning and classroom 
and hands-on training on new systems and processes. You can also have “sandbox training,” so that employees can try 
their hand at the system before it goes live, and new associates can play with the system. A good understanding of the 
basics of SAP TM will help reduce resistance and foster greater acceptance of the new system.
You may have technology loyalists who do not wish to migrate to the new platform. They may have been working with 
other technology for years. They have a fear of losing their seniority and may also be unwilling to be trained on another 
platform. In such a case, you may lose these associates and their domain knowledge, but this loss must be minimized. 
You have the option of hiring from the job market, training your own associates, or both. When it comes to hiring 
associates, obtaining experienced resources may be a problem. Also, these new resources bring a different culture and 
may take time to become productive. It is therefore recommended that you have the right mix of resources for your 
team. Your firm has the choice of selecting the most qualified vendor to do the job. Not having a sound team on your 
side can prove to be a major handicap.
Systems
Your organization has been using legacy systems to manage transportation planning, execution, and related activities. 
You were using multiple systems for different modes of transport, lines of business, and regions/countries, perhaps 
with different systems specific to a customer or product line. Your new system replaces multiple disparate systems 
with one integrated solution in which all the functionalities are supported. 
Retirement of the legacy application is a major transformational change. Now, you must decide what to retire, 
what to decommission, what to do with data in the old systems, and how to handle active shipments as well as billing 
and invoicing. Very few of these questions have a clear and appropriate answer. Users find it convenient to work with 
old systems and may prolong using them until the new system is available. Reconciliation becomes a major problem. 
You must have a clear strategy for decommissioning old applications so that they do not interfere with usage of the 
new solution. Make sure you migrate required data and archive what is needed for reference, as indicated in the 
guidelines. It makes sense to close the shipments in the systems in which they originated. The few that may have 
attracted claims and penalties should be dealt with separately; you will require their data for settlement. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ TRANSFORMATION IMPACT OF SAP TM IMPLEMENTATION
72
With a highly integrated and single solution implemented, you require a team that provides 24/7 support. If you 
were decentralized earlier, your resources were supporting the old applications during working hours. However, in 
the new scenario, your team members will need to work around-the-clock, because being a global company, some of 
or all the countries in your network could be working at any time of the day or night. It is best to use resources from a 
systems integrator (SI) vendor. If you were managing everything in-house so far, introduction of SI vendors to manage 
the new environment may also represent yet another challenge.
SAP TM is helping organizations transform.  A logistics and transport service provider based out of Europe  
has implemented the SAP TM solution to transform itself from a regional to a global transportation player.  
The organization was able to achieve cost reduction and increased operational efficiencies using SAP TM. Major 
gains were also experienced in decreasing the time required to process pricing and invoicing and in streamlining 
fleet routing, transportation planning, and distribution. The SAP TM solution is helping organizations differentiate 
themselves from their competitors.
Morever, one of the world’s largest 3PLs, headquartered in Europe, is implementing a transformational program 
with SAP TM at its center that targets three key improvement areas:
Increased customer intimacy
•฀
Improved transparency
•฀
Greater productivity
•฀
This global business, with its Internet technology (IT) transformation program, is enabling introduction of  
a new, homogeneous, consistent process landscape and transformation of the current IT landscape to one that is 
state-of-the-art. 
Finally, these are some of the key benefits realized by a leading food service manufacturer headquartered in 
North America post SAP TM implementation:
Reduced execution costs by optimizing freight consolidation.
•฀
Improved decision making and exception management by leveraging SAP TM capability to 
•฀
provide visibility throughout the freight life cycle.
Improved collaboration with carriers/partners; better tendering process, load acceptance, 
•฀
status details, sharing of details of actual performance and areas of improvement/opportunity, 
and so on.
Summary
Transformation affects processes, people, and systems. All of these play a major role in your business. You must 
appreciate, assess, and find solutions for the impacts of the change on your organization, or the goals of your 
transformation journey will not be achieved. It is important to share transformation vision and goals with all 
the partners in the ecosystem, including your customers and vendors. This transformation should be seen as an 
organization-wide mission. The backing of executives and management support are thus critical success factors. 
Executive-level management should come out with a visualization of the project’s success that should be cascaded 
throughout the company. Transformations should be handled in such a way as to miminize negative effects on your 
organization, so that business can run as usual.

CHAPTER 9
New Dimension Products: HANA, 
Mobility, and Analytics—Their Impact 
on Transportation Management
In this chapter, we will deal with the following:
Introduction to the new SAP TM suite of products/solutions
•฀
How these products/solutions can help obtain early return on investment
•฀
In the development of trade, and thereby commerce, an efficient transportation and logistics network is 
essential. In this arena any inefficiency can result in loss. Hence, players in the transportation and logistics industry 
are under constant pressure with respect to their operations to be more agile, reduce cost and complexity through 
better forecasting and analysis, improve efficiency by gaining more insight into supply chain execution, and foster 
sustainability. The complexity associated with managing a global network—changing cross-border and trade rules 
and regulations, evolving offering models, and increasingly demanding customers—is forcing transportation and 
logistics industry players to innovate. 
We strongly suggest that transportation and logistics players (like you) invest in solutions that can provide  
these benefits: 
 
1. 
Access to real-time data; for example, having access to real-time information generated 
from assets can dynamically determine maintenance needs (predictive maintenance).
 
2. 
The ability to analyze large volumes of data to generate meaningful insights; for instance, 
carriers can use big data analytics to determine potential routes for operations, thereby 
minimizing overhead costs associated with failed routes.
 
3. 
Integrated solutions that present a single view of data throughout the enterprise,  
thus greatly reducing cost and complexity.
 
4. 
The capability to track, analyze, and interpret conversations with customers on the  
social web.
In sum, you need integrated solutions that can give you access to real-time data, while offering analytical 
capabilities for structured and unstructured data. Here, we suggest a few solutions from the SAP TM product suite  
that can meet these challenges. We also believe that once you have implemented SAP, introducing these  
products/solutions in your landscape can help you obtain early return on investment.

CHAPTER 9 ■ NEW DIMENSION PRODUCTS: HANA, MOBILITY, AND ANALYTICS—THEIR IMPACT ON TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT
74
SAP HANA Solutions
SAP HANA is at the center of SAP’s technology strategy, and its key applications already support SAP HANA or have 
SAP HANA support in the road map. A few key SAP HANA–based solutions are available for the transportation and 
logistics industry. SAP HANA’s adoption by this industry has been relatively slow. However, we believe that adoption 
will soon increase as more logistics organizations implement SAP TM and as predictive technologies gain prevalence 
and achieve widespread acceptance. SAP HANA enables businesses to access transactional data in real time and to 
analyze large volumes of data quickly. We are sure your organization can use the capabilities of HANA for ensuring 
optimization and on-time performance; improving planning, forecasting, and carrier selection; and much more.  
In the following sections, we examine the key business drivers of a few select subindustries within the transportation 
and logistics industry to demonstrate how HANA can add value.
Fleet Operators (Surface Transportation)
Trucks form an integral part of surface transportation. The profitability of a fleet operator is dependent on his or 
her ability to ensure optimal capacity use, on-time performance, and availability and to reduce fuel expenses and 
maintenance overheads. SAP HANA can help fleet operators in the following ways:
•฀
Vehicle maintenance: SAP HANA can help fleet operators better manage vehicle 
maintenance. Data models can analyze information collected from onboard computers to 
gauge a vehicle’s maintenance needs. Based on this analysis, fleet operators can perform 
vehicle maintenance proactively.
•฀
Real-time route management: Access to real-time information can enable operators to 
change routes dynamically to prevent inadvertent delays resulting from inclement weather or 
traffic problems.
•฀
Capacity and fuel management: By using sophisticated planning and forecasting models, 
operators can identify the optimal number of trucks to operate and the shortest possible route 
for each trip, thereby reducing overhead costs caused by inferior routes and empty trucks.
Rail Operators 
Some of the key advantages that SAP HANA offers fleet operators, such as proactive maintenance, optimal route 
planning, and capacity, are equally applicable to rail operators. In addition, SAP HANA can help rail operators in the 
areas of asset management and customer management.
•฀
Asset management: Information, generated from sensors across the rail network, can be 
fed into data models to determine disruptions in real time. Insights from this data can help 
identify network problems proactively, thereby reducing repair overheads and ensuring safety.
•฀
Customer management: During rollout of new service product and promotion, rail operators 
can leverage SAP HANA’s ability to process large volumes of data to segment customers, thus 
helping rail operators better target them.

CHAPTER 9 ■ NEW DIMENSION PRODUCTS: HANA, MOBILITY, AND ANALYTICS—THEIR IMPACT ON TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT
75
Airlines (Air Transportation)
The air transportation industry can also benefit substantially from the real-time data management capabilities of 
SAP HANA. In the case of the airline industry, we recommend use of HANA for all the aforementioned as well as the 
following areas:
•฀
Predictive maintenance: Airlines can best make use of HANA for predicting maintenance of 
assets, as part of maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO).
•฀
Route profitability and fuel management: HANA can be used for forecasting route potential 
and profitability.
Along similar lines, firms involved in ocean freight can also benefit from the capabilities of SAP HANA.
SAP TM is gaining acceptability in the transportation and logistics industry as an integrated system used 
for transactions, planning, and monitoring. Essentially, this means that SAP TM is the source of most of the data 
generated within any organization that implements it. Therefore, we suggest integration of SAP TM with SAP HANA 
for analysis of any kind. The next version of SAP TM running SAP HANA will have prebuilt supply chain reporting, 
which will enhance reporting capabilities and near real-time decision-making. Also, large and global rail freight 
operators are exploring implementation of a freight management solution leveraging the power of SAP HANA.
Mobility
Your organization manages the “move” function in the supply chain, in which you are responsible for planning, 
implementing, and controlling forward and reverse flow of goods, services, and related information between point 
of origin and destination. Freight moves either directly or through one or more transshipment points by one or more 
modes of transport, and multiple agencies handle the freight at different stages of its life cycle. Also on the move 
are assets, such as trucks; trailers; trains; vessels; containers; aircraft; material-handling equipment; and people 
performing pickup, delivery, and sales jobs. With so many actors on the move, it is important to know where they are, 
what they are engaged with, when they will be available for the next task, what they can perform, whether they faced 
any difficulties in the field, whether they are performing as expected, and much more; customers expect you to know 
what is happening to their freight, how far it has traveled, when it will be delivered to them, whether is it intact or 
damaged, and so on. You need to have visibility of the life cycle of freight, along with asset use and two-way access to 
people in the field. Mobile technologies integrated with SAP–centric supply chain execution can address most of these 
challenges. Mobile devices in the field can capture freight-related data and share them with a central server on which 
a SAP–centric supply chain execution platform is installed. The information can thus be made available ahead of time 
for freight planning. Information on delivery, delays, and deviations captured in the field can be easily populated in 
the system and used internally and outputted to customers and vendors. In this way, you can increase productivity, 
while lowering operational costs and enhancing customer service.
Mobile technologies that can be deployed in the your industry are the Global Positioning System (GPS), for 
tracking assets and location-based services; radio frequency identification (RFID), for locating freight in warehouses/
terminals; RFID readers and scanners, for faster scans, counts, issues, and receipts; and mobile phones with business 
applications, for inquiries, updates, and two-way communication.
With the help of various mobile technologies, you can
Streamline load planning, routing, and scheduling to eliminate the costly misrouting of 
•฀
shipments
Monitor driver and vehicle performance and relay dynamic routing decisions to drivers to 
•฀
help reduce costs
Ensure on-time delivery of shipment by route optimization, constant connect and 
•฀
communication on real-time basis with drivers, and tracking of last-minute changes

76
Eliminate costly paper-based processes by using advanced data capture technologies to scan 
•฀
freight data digitally, transmit them to central/local servers, update delivery information 
and payment details, and transmit photos of damaged freight to insurance and claims 
departments
Get real-time visibility of driver and vehicle performance to identify the location of your 
•฀
drivers, the speed at which they are driving, and their driving patterns
Track idling beyond normal limits, accurately schedule load pickups, and deploy the most 
•฀
appropriate truck to the customer
Use smart business applications on mobile devices with reporting dashboards and workflows 
•฀
to improve collaboration between actors in the supply chain execution; as SAP TM sits at the 
center of the landscape, it can play the role of data hub—all updates to data can go through 
SAP TM or get updated into SAP
Social Media Integration
Given the increased use of social networks worldwide, social media is opening up new business opportunities by 
creating two-way communication, enabling customer feedback and response in real time. For the size and scope of 
the industry, it is imperative to tap the potential of social media to drive efficiencies and connect with customers; 
business partners; and ecosystems, such as universities, research organizations, and regulatory agencies.
Social media allows the sharing of information relevant to the industry, such as updates on fuel prices, carrier 
rates, new lanes, industry news, available loads, travel advisories, complaints, feedback, and views. Some of the 
information provided can be used as is. Modern carriers are proactively handling customer issues and complaints 
through Facebook and Twitter. Many 3PLs are posting freight details on Twitter to help find carriers to transport it. 
Trucking companies are sharing the location of equipment, looking for loads to haul. The first thing most shippers 
using transportation management systems (TMS) do is broadcast load tendering to a relatively small and select group 
of carriers with which a relationship has already been established while handling other lanes. Shippers and brokers 
post loads that are visible only to such carriers, which they trust. Carriers post available capacity and regular lanes on 
their web site, as they are confident that only their trusted shippers or brokers can see them. Videos of your operations 
and demonstrations illustrating how you are different from others can have a long-lasting impact on customers.
Social media is complementary to and not a replacement of TMS; order execution is managed by TMS after an 
appropriate match is made. Integration with social media is important for making full use of SAP. Leading 3PLs have 
portals that provide data access to all partners and customers, while offering access to social discussions to others.
SAP, being the core transaction system, can share its data on social networks, such as availability of freight or 
assets. You can use cases built on SAP TM to fetch this data using logic; for example, freight that has not found a buyer 
in six hours can be sent to social media for sharing. A logistics company with a small program using social media 
to match offers to available freight or to suggest best matches, along with SAP, will have options beyond the limited 
partner base.
Analytics
The industry is moving beyond just reporting historical data to predictive analysis. The major hurdle, however, is 
data residing in disparate systems. In the absence of integrated data, actionable intelligence that can lead to gains in 
efficiency, cost savings, and improved customer service is lost. Organizations implementing SAP TM have this data 
residing in a single system, saving the time required to mine data. More important, the sanctity of the data is retained, 
thus supporting fact-based decisions with little expenditure of time. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ NEW DIMENSION PRODUCTS: HANA, MOBILITY, AND ANALYTICS—THEIR IMPACT ON TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT
77
SAP TM addresses a number of issues, such as the following:
Amount of weight transported per trade lane, business share, or transportation allocation
•฀
Amount of volume transported per trade lane, business share, or transportation allocation
•฀
Number of containers shipped on a specific relation
•฀
Average transport costs per trade lane, carrier, shipper, or consignee
•฀
Reliability of shipper, carrier, or consignee (based on time data from SAP)
•฀
Percentage of dangerous goods shipments, compared with the overall number of shipments 
•฀
per trade lane
SAP TM also provides many ready-made reports:
•฀
SAP TM BW 7.3 Enhancement Package 1: More focused on cost and carrier analysis
•฀
SAP TM 8.0: More shipper specific
•฀
SAP TM 9.0: Covers revenue-related reports
However, given the wealth of data SAP TM will have after a few months of implementation, organizations should 
identify key performance indicators for their business; derive definitions (formulas) for them; identify data elements; 
and build a strategy to move relevant data into the workplace to monitor key performance indicators, build “what if?” 
scenarios, and create dashboards for decision makers at every level of the organization.
Summary
A SAP TM platform integrated with HANA, a mobility platform, a social media platform, and business intelligence 
(BI) can give you access to real-time information, while providing you with analytical capabilities from structured and 
unstructured data. In this chapter, we have highlighted some benefits across the transportation and logistics industry. 
Knowing the capabilities and features of these products/solutions, we strongly believe that once you have implemented 
SAP, introducing these products/solutions in your landscape can help you obtain early return on investment.

CHAPTER 10
Process Mapping End-to-End Freight 
Life Cycle Scenarios
In this chapter, we will discuss the following:
High-level processes that make up the end-to-end life cycle of freight logistics
•฀
Mapping these processes in SAP TM
•฀
The mapping of one end-to-end freight logistics process flow scenario in SAP TM
•฀
Having gained an understanding of SAP TM and its architecture, let’s take a look at the freight process life cycle  
as well as its mapping in SAP TM, together with SAP Event Management (SAP EM), SAP Global Trade Services  
(SAP GTS), and SAP ERP.
Setting Up a Customer Account
Once the customer agrees to the financial and service terms and conditions and the 3PL, the credit department 
reviews the customer’s credit history and establishes credit limits. The finance department sets up a client account in 
the system, with credit limits and, subsequently, a pricing agreement.
The finance department uses a financial system, such as SAP FICO, to set up the customer account and credit 
limits. The customer account is then transferred to SAP TM as a business partner or location, or both. The pricing 
agreement is created in SAP TM as forwarding agreement.
Receiving a Shipment Booking
The 3PL receives the booking request from the customer via phone, fax, e-mail, electronic data display (EDI), or 
portal. The customer contacts the 3PL’s local office, centralized customer service department, or agent/subsidiary. 
The customer service agent in the location contacted by the customer gathers more information from the 
customer with respect to the shipment. Typically, this information includes mode of transportation (air, ocean, or 
ground [road or rail]), size (full container load [FCL] or less than container load [LCL]), whether the shipment consists 
of dangerous goods or perishables, when the shipment is available to move or is needed at its destination,  
the shipment’s place of origin and destination, and whether the shipment is be picked up or dropped off by the 
customer at the location specified by the 3PL—a branch, gateway, port, warehouse, and so on.
Orders from multiple applications, customers, and modes (phone, fax, e-mail, EDI, portal) are received in SAP 
TM as transportation requirements. Based on the order’s requirements and the business rules setup, the system 
builds freight units (the smallest transportation unit in SAP TM), which are used for consolidation or dividing of 
transportation requirements, or both, in order to size the shipment properly for transportation resources, such as 
trailers, containers, vessels, and railcars.

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCESS MAPPING END-TO-END FREIGHT LIFE CYCLE SCENARIOS
80
Sending a Notification of a Customer’s Order
The customer’s order notification is sent via phone, fax, or e-mail to the necessary parties, such as the export agent 
and the Planning department.
SAP TM offers a personal object work list (POWL) through which the concerned parties (export agent, Planning 
department, and so on) can access, manage, and track tasks related to the order. 
Planning Freight Transportation Route
The Planning department plans the route the freight will travel to its destination. Sometimes, the Planning 
department may route the freight from customer, to branch, to gateway; other times, the freight may be routed directly 
from customer to gateway, airport, or port. The main goal is to get the freight from place of origin to destination at the 
lowest cost possible. 
In SAP TM the Planning department has the option of planning the order either manually or automatically. With 
automatic planning the vehicle-scheduling and -routing engine running in the background plans the order’s route. To 
plan manually, SAP TM offers transportation cockpit, which the Planning department should use. Once supplied with 
selection and planning profile, the transportation cockpit determines which orders will be listed for planning as well 
as the resources and schedules available. Furthermore, the Planning department has the following options in cases of 
manual planning:
•฀
Interactive planning: Orders to be planned are selected and then dragged and dropped onto 
the resource/schedule.
•฀
One-step planning: Once orders to be planned are selected, the vehicle-scheduling  
and -routing engine is called to plan them.
•฀
Generation of transportation proposal: This option is used if multiple routing options are to 
be viewed before making decisions.
Once the route is planned, the carrier can be selected. SAP TM provides manual and automatic options for 
choosing the carrier. SAP TM also has these tendering options:
•฀
Peer-to-peer tendering: The freight request for quotation is sent sequentially to each 
proposed carrier.
•฀
Broadcast tendering: The freight request for quotation is sent to all proposed carriers 
simultaneously.
The direct tendering process can also be used to send the order directly to a specific carrier without requesting a 
quotation.
Booking a Carrier
The Planning department arranges for the carrier booking for the main leg. The Planning department communicates 
with the carrier via phone, fax, e-mail, or, EDI and requests a booking of necessary space. After receiving the booking 
request, the carrier may decide to accept or reject the request or accept it with modification. In all cases, thecarrier 
notifies the Planning department of the decision.
To enter the booking information, SAP TM provides a freight-booking user interface. Through this interface, the 
Planning department can request the booking for space with the carrier. The information can be transferred from SAP 
TM to carrier via fax, e-mail, EDI, or portal. The interface also allows for capture of carrier response.

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCESS MAPPING END-TO-END FREIGHT LIFE CYCLE SCENARIOS
81
Confirming an Order with the Customer
Once the carrier accepts the booking, the customer receives order confirmation via phone, fax, e-mail, or EDI.
The forwarding-order user interface in SAP TM offers the option of confirming the order with the customer.
Arranging for the Pickup of Freight
If freight pickup is required, the branch export agent arranges for it with a local carrier. The pickup request is made 
to the local carrier via phone, fax, e-mail, or EDI. The pickup request contains information such as where to pick 
up and deliver the freight, date and time of pickup, and whether any special equipment is required. After receiving 
confirmation (to carry out the pickup) from the carrier, the necessary documents are provided to the carrier. 
The branch export agent can use the freight-order user interface in SAP TM for the pickup request. The interface 
allows the user to enter the required information, generate the necessary documents, and send the information and 
documents to the carrier. In addition, acceptance and rejection of the pickup request can be captured.
Picking Up Freight and Delivering It to the Origin Dock
On the prearranged date of freight pickup, the carrier is dispatched, along with documentation, to the location of 
the shipper/supplier. There, the freight is loaded onto a truck, and shipping documentation, such as commercial 
invoice (CI), shipper’s letter of instruction (SLI), and shipper’s export declaration (SED), is collected from the shipper/
supplier. Freight and documentation are delivered to a branch or location communicated at the time of the pickup 
request. A dockworker unloads the freight from the carrier’s truck, checks it in, signs the paperwork, stores the freight 
in the branch warehouse or other storage location, and turns in the paperwork to the export agent.
Freight execution and track and trace are handled in SAP TM through the freight-order user interface. SAP TM 
offers a standard set of events concerning the cargo, such as “Ready for Loading,” “Loaded,” “Departed,” and “Arrived,” 
for track and trace. SAP TM can also be integrated with SAP EM for better track and trace.
Preparing a Shipment for Movement
The branch export agent receives the paperwork from the dockworker and creates a pick list document for the 
dockworker so that he or she can pull shipments (whole or partial) for consolidation. Instructions for any special 
services or handling that may need to be performed are also noted.
The SAP TM freight-order user interface can be used to print various documents.
Performing Export Customs Clearance (if Requested)
Not every customer awards this to the same 3PL. If awarded, however, export compliance checking for a denied party, 
embargoed countries, known shippers, and denied commodities is performed. Information is supplied to a customs 
official via fax, e-mail, EDI, or portal; by using a third-party provider; or by submitting hard copy of documents. The 
customs official processes the shipments and either holds them or gives clearance. 
Customs clearance status for the order can be set manually in SAP TM. Depending on the setting, SAP TM 
may block further order execution if required. If SAP TM is integrated with SAP GTS, the customs status can be set 
automatically.

82
Preparing Consolidation and Documentation
Based on the pick list document received from the export agent, a dockworker pulls the freight from the branch 
warehouse shelves or other storage location and builds consolidation as needed. If any additional services are to 
be performed, such as packing, shrink-wrapping, or fumigation, these are noted on the pick list document. The 
dockworker makes note on the pick list document of discrepancies, services performed, and collected paperwork with 
regard to these services, adding additional comments if necessary. 
Shipping instructions can be viewed as well as printed with the SAP TM freight-order user interface.
Handing Over Consolidation to the Line-Haul Carrier
The line-haul carrier arrives, the freight is loaded onto the truck, and the paperwork is signed and turned over to the 
carrier driver.
SAP TM provides the option to view as well as print the shipping manifest using the freight-order user interface.
Moving Freight to the Gateway
The carrier departs from the branch or other specified location en route to the gateway. The gateway is notified via 
phone, fax, or e-mail.
SAP TM has a standard set of status events, such as “Departed” and “In Execution,” through the freight-order user 
interface. Based on the status of the freight order, the status of the forwarding order is updated automatically, thereby 
allowing order tracking. SAP TM can be integrated with SAP EM for more enhanced tracking. Morever, using POWL, 
personnel can access and track orders that are expected for arrival.
Delivering Freight to the Gateway
The line-haul carrier delivers the freight and documentation to the gateway. A dockworker unloads the freight from 
the carrier’s truck, checks in the freight, signs the paperwork, stores the freight in a gateway warehouse location, and 
turns in the paperwork to the gateway agent. The carrier invoices the 3PL for services performed. 
The SAP TM freight-order user interface can be used to calculate the freight charges the carrier will be invoicing. 
The interface can also be used to update the status to “Arrived.” Based on the status of the freight order, the status of 
the forwarding order is updated automatically, thereby allowing order tracking. . SAP TM can be integrated with SAP 
EM for more enhanced tracking.
Planning Outbound Consolidation
The gateway agent views the inbound consolidations and determines the outbound consolidations that need to 
be planned for, such as necessary equipment (containers, and so on). Outbound consolidation plans are based on 
when the inbound consolidations will arrive, their destination, the services required for the shipments in those 
consolidations, the type of commodity, whether the shipment consists of dangerous goods or perishables or is of high 
value, and whether the shipment is oversized or overweight for its mode of transport.
The gateway agent can use the planning engine to identify the resources available as well as shipments that 
can be consolidated. With consolidation the planning engine takes into consideration various parameters, such as 
incompatibilities, capacity, and loading and unloading duration. The planning engine also checks for dangerous 
goods. Planning can be done automatically or manually.

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCESS MAPPING END-TO-END FREIGHT LIFE CYCLE SCENARIOS
83
Assigning a Shipment to Outbound Gateway Consolidation
The gateway agent assigns the shipments (whole or partial) to movements that have been confirmed by the 
carrier. The agent also creates a pick list document for the dockworker so that he or she can pull the shipments for 
consolidation. Instructions for any special services or handling that may need to be performed are noted.
The gateway agent can use the freight-booking user interface in SAP TM to generate a shipping document to be 
given to the dockworker, with instructions for physical/actual consolidation.
Preparing Consolidation
A dockworker receives the pick list document from the gateway agent, pulls the freight on the pick list from the 
gateway warehouse shelves, and builds consolidation; additional services are performed as requested, such as 
packing, shrink-wrapping, and fumigation. The dockworker makes note on the pick list document of discrepancies , 
services performed, and collected paperwork with regard to these services. The dockworker turns in the notated pick 
list to the gateway agent.
Creating Paperwork for the Main Carriage
The gateway agent creates appropriate transportation paperwork, such as house bill of lading (HBL), master bill of 
lading (MBL), and forwarder’s cargo receipt (FCR)/master bill of detailed manifest. The gateway agent sends the 
completed paperwork to the appropriate parties, for example, delivering transportation paperwork to the dockworker 
or providing documents to the carrier (via fax, e-mail, or EDI). 
The SAP TM freight-booking user interface offers the option to view as well as print the manifest and other 
documents.
Creating Paperwork for Cartage and Dispatching it to  
the Main Carrier
The gateway agent arranges for the movement of consolidations (of cartage) from the gateway to the main carrier. 
The cartage carrier may pick up and deliver one or more consolidations. The cartage carrier arrives, and the freight 
is loaded onto the truck. The paperwork is signed and turned over to the cartage carrier driver. The cartage carrier 
departs and takes the consolidations to the appropriate carriers. The gateway agent may update the movements 
to“Tendered to Carrier" status. Freight is delivered to the main carrier.
A freight order can be created with the freight-booking user interface in SAP TM. The gateway agent can use the 
interface to arrange for cartage movement and to generate the necessary documents.
Moving Freight to the Destination Gateway or Branch
After delivery to the main carrier, the freight is loaded onto the means of transport (aircraft, ship, truck, railcar). The 
transport departs; departure and arrival information can be sent via EDI to the destination gateway, branch, and 
transshipment gateway as applicable.
The freight-booking user interface in SAP TM provides a standard set of status events, such as “In Execution” and 
“Uplift Confirmed.” SAP TM will automatically create the import freight booking and forwarding order as soon as the 
status of the freight booking is set to “Uplift Confirmed” (in case of air) or “Shipped on Board” (in case of ocean). SAP 
TM can be integrated with SAP EM for more enhanced tracking.

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCESS MAPPING END-TO-END FREIGHT LIFE CYCLE SCENARIOS
84
Performing Import Customs Clearance
Once the freight is loaded onto aircraft, ship, truck, or railcar, and that vehicle departs for its international destination, 
the inbound destination branch/gateway is kept informed as well as the customs agency at the destination port/
border. The destination branch of the 3PL informs customers about expected shipments. Clearance of the inbound 
shipment may or may not be carried out by the 3PL responsible for forwarding the shipment, as every customer is free 
to appoint a customs clearing agent, and this can be the 3PL carrying the shipment or another player. Customs may 
choose to inspect the cargo using x-ray, physical examination, document inspection, and so on; duties and taxes are 
paid to customs either by the 3PL or by the customer directly.
SAP TM offers the option to update the customs status of the order manually. Furthermore, SAP TM can be 
integrated with SAP GTS to enable compliance checking and communication with customs as well as receipt of status 
updates from customs. 
Arranging for Pickup of the Freight from the Carrier
If freight pickup from the main carrier is required, the branch/inbound gateway agent arranges for it with a carrier. 
A collection order is generated for the cartage carrier for pickup of the freight from the main carrier. The collection 
order is sent to the cartage carrier, informing it of where to pick up and deliver the cargo as well as of any special 
equipment needed to move it. At the main carrier’s location, the freight is loaded onto the truck. Typically, shipping 
documentation (sent via fax, e-mail, or mail) is collected from the main carrier. The cartage carrier delivers the freight 
and documentation to the specified location.
From the main carrier the freight may be moved directly to the destination branch location, or it may stop at a 
gateway before moving to the branch. The cartage carrier invoices for services performed. A dockworker unloads the 
freight from the cartage carrier’s truck, checks it in, signs the paperwork, stores the freight in the warehouse, and turns 
in the paperwork to the import agent.
The branch agent can use either the freight-order user interface or freight-booking user interface in SAP TM to 
create a freight order for picking up the freight from the main carrier and delivering it to the destination branch or 
gateway.
Arranging for the Delivery of Freight
Once the freight is cleared by customs, clients can pick it up from the branch. If delivery is required, however, a 
branch agent arranges for it with a local carrier. A request for delivery is made to the carrier via phone, fax, e-mail, 
or EDI. The carrier confirms the request using one of these same methods. The necessary documents are generated 
and sent to the carrier, informing it of where to pick up and deliver the freight as well as of any special equipment 
needed to move it. 
The branch agent can use the freight-order user interface in SAP TM to request delivery. Once the order is 
accepted, the necessary documents can be generated.
Delivering Freight to the Customer
The local carrier arrives at the designated customer location. The freight is unloaded, and the documentation, if 
any, is handed over to the customer, who in turn gives the proof of delivery to the carrier. The carrier may inform 
the branch agent of the delivery and give the proof of delivery to him or her. The branch agent then marks the order 
as delivered. If money has to be collected from the delivery address, the driver delivering the freight collects it and 
subsequently brings it to the branch or to his or her company.
A standard set of events is provided in SAP TM to track and trace the freight order. In addition, SAP TM can be 
integrated with SAP EM for better trace and track.

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCESS MAPPING END-TO-END FREIGHT LIFE CYCLE SCENARIOS
85
Calculating the Charges on a Shipment
Charges on a shipment may be categorized as follows:
Origin charges
•฀
Transportation charges (main transportation charge and other charges  
•฀
associated with it, e.g., fuel surcharge, security fee)
Destination charges
•฀
Duties and taxes (pass-through charges)
•฀
Charges may be entered in as one currency and billed in another, in which case the Currency Adjustment 
Factor (CAF) is charged. Charges may be included in a rate, waived, or rolled up. International Commercial Terms 
(Incoterms) help in determining which party will pay for what charges.
SAP TM offers the option to store the contractual rates agreed to with the customer. These rates are used to 
calculate the charges to be levied on the customer.
Invoicing for Services
The billing clerk may manually invoice charges, or charges may be invoiced based on the business rules setup. 
Moreover, clients may be invoiced at different times:
Origin clients may be invoiced after a shipment departs from its country of origin.
•฀
Destination clients may be invoiced after delivery to the consignee.
•฀
Once the invoice is created, it can be printed at a location designated by the user or at a centralized location and 
sent to the customer either electronically (via EDI) or in print format. Documents often pulled from imaging may need 
to be attached to the invoice, such as house bill of lading/(HAWB), master air waybill (MAWB)/MBL, Goods Received 
Voucher GRV, and FCR.
SAP TM provides options for calculating the charges automatically or manually. After the charges have been 
calculated, a forwarding settlement document is created in SAP TM. This document is then transferred to a financial 
system, such as SAP FICO (ERP), where the final invoice is created and posted. 
Verifying the Invoice and Executing the Freight Settlement
The carrier whose services were used sends an invoice to the accounts payable department for settlement. The 
accounts payable clerk checks the invoice submitted for any discrepancies. If no discrepancies are found, the invoice 
is processed for settlement. In the case of a discrepancy, it is resolved by issuing a debit or credit note.
The freight charges that the carrier invoices can be calculated manually or automatically in SAP TM. The 
charges are calculated based on the freight agreement in the system. A freight settlement document is created and 
transferred to a financial system. If the financial system is SAP FICO, then a purchase order and service entry sheet are 
automatically created based on the freight settlement document. Then, invoice verification can be done, followed by 
posting and final settlement.
Now that you have had an overview of process mapping, let’s look at the process flows and their SAP TM mapping 
for a door-to-door LTL/parcel air shipment scenario (see Figure 10-1). Assume that the customer account is set up 
and that the customer has requested a door-to-door international movement of LTL shipment as well as customs 
clearance service at both export and import side; the main leg is via air, and the other legs, via road.

Note
 
■
 The purpose of this appendix is to provide a glimpse of SAP TM functionalities and should not be seen as  
standard. Furthermore, SAP TM provides multiple options for performing activities, and this appendix is restricted to  
illustrating only one of the variety of options available for each.
Scenario
To get a better understanding of SAP TM functionality, let’s consider the following scenario:
HEPUSHA Corporation Ltd., a multinational 3PL, has operations in Japan and the United States. Operations in 
Japan are handled by HEPUSHA Japan. Operations in the United States are handled by HEPUSHA USA.
In Japan, HEPUSHA has many gateways, including one in Narita, as well as many stations catering to different 
locations in Japan, including Yokohama. Similarly, the company has gateways and stations in a number of locations in 
the United States, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively.
The Yokohama station receives an order from Shipcam International to move consignment from Yokohama to 
Coman Ltd., in San Diego.
The Yokohama station in turn hires Vistala Roadways to pick up the consignment from Shipcam International 
and bring it to the Yokohama station. To move the consignment from the Yokohama station to the Narita gateway, 
Astala Carriers is used. From the Narita gateway the consignment will be on loaded on a Mistala Airlines plane at 
Narita International Airport (NRT) and brought to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and then on to the Los 
Angeles gateway. Next, the consignment will be moved to the San Francisco station, using the services of MacMovers 
Carriers. Finally, it will be delivered to Coman Ltd., using the services of Delta Roadways.
Following are the master data and configurations required for this scenario.
Organizations
The SAP TM organizational model is independent from the SAP ERP organizational model. SAP TM offers these six 
organizational unit functions:
•฀
Corporate: This organizational unit function is the highest; it is optional.
•฀
Company: This is similar to ERP company.
•฀
Forwarding house: This organizational unit function is used for a single organization that can 
perform the functions of planning and execution, purchasing, and sales.
•฀
Planning and execution: For the organization that is responsible for the planning and 
execution function.
•฀
Purchasing: For the organization that is responsible for the purchasing function.
•฀
Sales: For the organization that is responsible for the sales function.
The three SAP TM organizational unit roles are as follows:
•฀
Organization: This organizational unit role is the highest that can be assigned to an 
organization.
•฀
Office: The office unit role can be defined only for an organizational unit with a sales function. 
The role can be assigned to an organizational unit with the organization role.
•฀
Group: This role can be defined for an organizational unit with the sales, purchasing, planning 
and execution, or forwarding house function. The role can be assigned to an organizational 
unit with the organization or office role.

Defining Resources
In SAP TM, resources play a vital role in planning and execution. Resource data, such as capacity and working times, 
serve as valuable input while planning an order.
SAP TM supports three types of resources:
•฀
Vehicle resource: A vehicle resource is a means of transport that can provide transportation 
service. The resource’s capacity and availability are defined in vehicle resource.
•฀
Calendar resource: This is a resource that can be assigned to a calendar. To schedule the 
processing time for good receipt and issue, a calendar resource is used.
•฀
Handling resource: A handling resource is a device that is used for handling goods at a 
specific location. The loading and unloading capacities of a resource are defined in handling 
resource.
For the given scenario, you will need to create the resources listed in Table A-10.

APPENDIX A ■ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CONFIGURING AND IMPLEMENTING SAP TM 9.0

Defining IATA Airline Codes
This option is used to define airline codes for each airfreight carrier as well as to assign an air waybill prefix to them. 
You can also specify whether the carrier is a member of the IATA with this option.
In the user interface of an airfreight document, such as an air forwarding order, there is an option to enter airline 
code. If airline code is entered, then the system automatically identifies the associated air waybill prefix. Furthermore, 
if there is a one-to-one relationship between the airline code and the associated carrier, the system can determine the 
relevant carrier based on the airline code entered.

Defining Schedule Types
Use this option to define the movement of trucks, ships, or airplanes that is valid for a specific period of time within 
the sequence of transportation stops, such as ports, airports, or gateways.
SAP TM allows you to define the following schedules:
•฀
Flight/Carrier/Road: This schedule lets you define the sequence of transportation stops 
served by airplanes, ships, and trucks, respectively. The schedule is used when the origin and 
destination stops are not gateway. The system also allows you to define departure rules, which 
in turn create flight/voyage/departure.
•฀
Master flight/Sailing/Road gateway: This schedule is used when the origin and destination 
stops are gateway. With this schedule, reference to flight/carrier/road schedule can be 
provided. Copying of departure rules and flight/voyage/departure is also possible.
By specifying schedule types, schedules are defined in system.
For the given scenario, you will need to define the schedule types shown in Table A-58.

orders (on-carriage, delivery).
Note
 
■
 When the last expected customization event (freight-order type, freight-booking type, freight unit type) is raised, 
the execution status is set to ”Executed.”
Customer Billing and Freight Settlement
In this process the accounts department will calculate the charges to be levied on the customer, verify them, and 
invoice the customer. Similarly, the accounts payable department will perform the freight bill audit, verify the charges 
levied by the carrier, and do the freight settlement. The forwarding settlement and freight settlement user interface is 
one of the interfaces provided in SAP TM to perform this process.
Calculating Charges for Billing
For the given scenario, to calculate the charges, open the forwarding order (export) in edit mode, and then select 
Calculate Charges from the Calculate Charges menu.
Figure A-243. Forwarding order (export): Selecting Calculate Charges

APPENDIX A ■ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CONFIGURING AND IMPLEMENTING SAP TM 9.0
295
Figure A-244. Forwarding order (export): Display of charges
Save the forwarding order (export) by clicking the Save 
 button.
In this way, calculate the charges for the forwarding order (import).
Calculating Charges for Invoicing
For the given scenario, the charges for all freight orders (pickup, precarriage, on-carriage, delivery) as well as freight 
bookings will have been automatically calculated by the system.
Let’s assume, however, that for some reason the charges for the freight order (pickup) have not been 
automatically calculated. To calculate the charges, open the freight order (pickup) in edit mode, and then select 
Calculate Charges from the Calculate Charges menu.
Figure A-245. Freight order (pickup): Selecting Calculate Charges
As a result, the charges will be calculated based on the freight agreement.

APPENDIX A ■ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CONFIGURING AND IMPLEMENTING SAP TM 9.0
296
Figure A-246. Freight order (pickup): Display of charges
Save the freight order (pickup) by clicking the Save 
 button.
Check whether the charges are calculated for the other orders (precarriage, on-carriage, and so on). If the charges 
are not calculated, then calculate them in the same manner.
Billing (Forwarding Settlement)
To create an invoice for the customer, the forwarding settlement document is created and then transferred to a SAP 
ERP system or any other financial system.
To create a forwarding settlement for the given scenario, open the forwarding order (export) in edit mode, and 
then select Create Forwarding Settlement Document from the Follow-Up menu.
Figure A-247. Forwarding order (export): Creating a forwarding settlement document
The program will then ask you to specify the business partner for the forwarding settlement document. Select the 
appropriate business partner, and click the OK 
 button. As a result, the Forwarding Settlement Document window 
will open, with the life cycle status set to ”Ready for Invoicing” in SAP ERP.”

APPENDIX A ■ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CONFIGURING AND IMPLEMENTING SAP TM 9.0
297
To transfer the forwarding settlement document to SAP ERP, in the Settlement Document section, select the 
forwarding settlement document, and then click the Save and Transfer 
 button.
As a result, the life cycle status of the forwarding settlement document is set to Transferred for Invoicing in SAP 
ERP, and the billing document will be created in SAP ERP.
Once the billing document is created successfully in SAP ERP, the billing document number will be visible in the 
Document Flow tab of the forwarding settlement user interface, and the life cycle status of the forwarding settlement 
document will be set to Invoiced in SAP ERP.
Figure A-248. Forwarding settlement document: Life cycle status set as “Ready for Invoicing in SAP ERP”
Figure A-249. Forwarding settlement document: Life cycle status set as “Invoiced in SAP ERP”
In this way, create and transfer the forwarding settlement document for forwarding order (import).

APPENDIX A ■ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CONFIGURING AND IMPLEMENTING SAP TM 9.0
298
Invoicing (Freight Settlement)
To verify that the invoice has been received from the carrier, the freight settlement document is created and 
transferred to the SAP ERP system or any other financial system.
Let’s see how to create the freight settlement document for freight order (pickup). For this, open the freight order 
(pickup) in edit mode, and select Create Freight Settlement from the Follow-Up menu.
Figure A-250. Freight order (pickup): Creating a freight settlement document
As a result, the freight settlement window will open, with the life cycle status set as ”Ready for Accruals.”
Figure A-251. Freight settlement document: Life cycle status set as “Ready for Accruals”

APPENDIX A ■ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CONFIGURING AND IMPLEMENTING SAP TM 9.0
299
To transfer the freight settlement to SAP ERP, in the Settlement Document section, select the freight settlement 
document, and click the Save and Transfer 
 button.
As a result, the life cycle status of the freight settlement document is set to ”Transferred for Accruals,” and the 
purchase order and service entry sheet will be created in SAP ERP.
Once the purchase order and service entry sheet are created successfully in SAP ERP, the purchase order and 
service entry sheet number will be visible in the Document Flow tab of the freight settlement user interface, and the 
life cycle status of the freight settlement document will be set to “Accruals Posted.”
Figure A-252. Freight settlement document: Life cycle status set as “Accruals Posted”
Once the invoice is verified in SAP ERP, the invoice number is also visible in the Document Flow tab of the freight 
settlement user interface, and the life cycle status of the freight settlement document is set to ”Invoice Verified in ERP.”
In this way, create freight settlement documents for the other orders (precarriage, on-carriage, and so on).
Once the settlement document is created and transferred to SAP ERP, and the last expected events are raised, the 
life cycle status of the order (forwarding order, freight order, freight booking) is changed to ”Completed.”
