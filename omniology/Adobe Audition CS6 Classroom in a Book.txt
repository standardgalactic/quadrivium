Adobe Audition CS6 ClASSroom in A book 1
Adobe Audition is a professional audio application that combines advanced 
digital audio editing and multitrack recording in the same program. This 
unique approach integrates the two elements so that, for example, audio used 
in a multitrack project can be edited with great detail in the digital audio edi-
tor, then transferred back to the multitrack session. Mixdowns (mono, stereo, 
or surround) exported from the multitrack session are available automatically 
within the digital audio editor, where a variety of mastering tools are available 
to polish and “sweeten” the mix. The final mix can then be burned to a record-
able CD, which is created according to the standard Red Book specification, or 
converted into “web-friendly,” data-compressed formats like MP3 and FLAC. 
Furthermore, the Multitrack Editor has a video window that enables recording 
soundtracks and narration in Audition while previewing video. 
Audition is cross-platform and runs equally well with Macintosh or Windows 
computers. Thanks to combining two programs within a single, integrated 
application, Audition has multiple uses—restoring audio, multitrack recording 
for musicians, mastering, sound design, broadcast, video game sound, narra-
tion and voiceovers, file format conversion, small-scale CD production, and 
even forensics. Fortunately, all of this is available from a clean, easy-to-use, 
straightforward interface whose workflow has benefited from over a decade 
of continuous development and refinement.
The latest version, Audition CS6, deepens the level of integration with 
Premiere Pro and After Effects for easy exchange of files and even complete 
sequences. This greatly simplifies the process of creating a soundtrack that 
reflects changes in the video due to editing. There are also significant editing 
enhancements, such as envelope keyframe editing, clip grouping, multiple 
clipboards, real-time clip stretching, and more. Other new features include 
Automatic Speech Alignment to greatly simplify ADR, a media browser for 
quickly locating and previewing files, control surface support for multiple 
protocols, pitch correction, side-chaining, improved batch processing, and the 
ability to import and export more file formats than ever before. These are just 
the highlights; long-time Audition users will appreciate the many little extras 
that enhance workflow and audio quality, whereas those new to Audition will 
welcome its depth and flexibility.

about Classroom in a Book
Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book is part of the official training series for 
Adobe graphics, audio, and publishing software developed by experts in associa-
tion with Adobe Systems. The lessons are designed to let you learn at your own 
pace. If you’re new to Adobe Audition, you’ll learn the fundamental concepts and 
features needed to start mastering the program. And, if you’ve been using Adobe 
Audition for a while, you’ll find that Classroom in a Book teaches basic to inter-
mediate features, including tips and techniques for using the latest version of the 
application for a wide variety of projects.
Although each lesson concentrates on providing step-by-step instructions to reach 
specific goals, there’s room for exploration and experimentation. You can follow the 
book from start to finish, or do only the lessons that match your interests and needs. 
Each lesson has an introduction that explains what you can expect to learn from a 
chapter, and concludes with a review section summarizing what you’ve covered.
What’s in this book
This edition covers many new features in Adobe Audition CS6, and how to apply 
them optimally in real-world situations. It addresses audio and music professionals 
who depend on Audition’s tools to accomplish a variety of tasks, as well as videog-
raphers who want to become more involved in the process of creating, editing, and 
sweetening audio intended for video productions.
The book is organized in three separate parts. The introduction starts with how 
to get audio in and out of Audition on both Mac and Windows platforms, then 
progresses to an overview of the Audition Workspace—a collection of modules, 
each dedicated to specific tasks, that you can open, close, and rearrange, depend-
ing on the nature of the project, to optimize workflow and efficiency. The second 
part concentrates on digital audio editing in the Waveform Editor, and covers such 
topics as editing, signal processing and effects, audio restoration, mastering, and 
sound design. To segue into the final third, it also covers recording, and integration 
with the Multitrack Editor.
The final section covers the Multitrack Editor in detail, including editing, automa-
tion, creating music with sound libraries, in-depth coverage of mixing, and creating 
soundtracks for video. Throughout the book, examples using digital audio clips 
created specifically for this book give practical, hands-on experience that brings to 
life the theory presented in these pages. Even non-musicians will learn how to cre-
ate music using sound libraries and loops in conjunction with Audition’s extensive 
toolset for sound creation and editing. You’ll even learn how to do rough testing of 
your room acoustics prior to mixing, using tools within Audition.

As you progress through the lessons, you’ll also discover many time-saving features 
Audition offers such as file conversion, automation, Multitrack and Waveform 
Editor integration, clip automation, time-stretching, and more. All of these can 
help you meet deadlines more easily than ever before—and that alone is a good rea-
son to become familiar with Audition’s workflow, capabilities, and user interface.
Prerequisites
Before you begin to use Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book, you should have 
a working knowledge of your computer and its operating system. Make sure that 
you know how to use the mouse and standard menus and commands, and also how 
to open, save, and close files. If you need to review these techniques, see the docu-
mentation included with your Microsoft Windows or Macintosh system. It’s also 
highly recommended that you read over the introduction to the Audition manual 
that covers digital audio basics.
You’ll also need the ability to get audio in and out of your computer. Virtually all 
computers include on-board audio capabilities (audio input for recording, and 
internal speakers or a headphone jack for monitoring), but be aware that these use 
consumer-grade components and while adequate, will not showcase what Audition 
can do to the fullest extent. Professional and “prosumer” audio interfaces are avail-
able at very reasonable costs, and are recommended not just for doing the lessons 
in this book, but also for any future audio work involving computers.
installing adobe audition
Before you begin using Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book, make sure that 
your computer is set up correctly and that it meets the necessary system require-
ments for software and hardware. You’ll need a copy of Adobe Audition CS6, of 
course, but it’s not included with this book. If you haven’t purchased a copy, you 
can download a 30-day trial version from www.adobe.com/downloads. For system 
requirements and complete instructions on installing the software, see the Adobe 
Audition CS6 Read Me file on the application DVD or on the Web at www.adobe.
com/products/audition.html.
Note that Audition is a very efficient program, and one of its attributes is that it 
will run reasonably well even on older computers. However, as with most audio 
and video programs, having sufficient RAM is essential for a smooth computing 
experience. Although Audition will run with 1GB of RAM, for multitrack record-
ing 2GB is better, and 4GB is preferable; this is also the maximum amount of RAM 
usable with 32-bit versions of Windows. Current versions of Mac OS X and 64-bit 

4 
GettinG StArted
Windows 7 have no practical limitation on how much RAM they can address, so 
8GB of RAM or more is highly recommended.
Make sure that your serial number is accessible before installing the application. 
You need to install Audition from its application DVD, or the online trial version 
you downloaded, onto your hard disk; you cannot run the program from the DVD. 
Follow the onscreen instructions for a successful installation.

Audio interfAcing 
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Configure a Macintosh computer’s on-board audio for use 
with Audition
• Choose the appropriate sample rate for a project 
• Set up the on-board audio in Windows computers for use 
with Audition
• Set up Windows audio interfacing regardless of whether you’re 
running XP (with Service Pack 3) or Windows 7 (Service Pack 1, 
32-bit, or 64-bit)
• Configure Audition to work with Macintosh or Windows 
computers
• Test your configurations to make sure all connections are correct
This lesson will take about 45 minutes to complete. There are no 
audio lesson files because you’ll be recording your own files to test the 
interface connections.

Before you can use Audition, you need to configure 
your computer and audio system to work with the 
program. This lesson covers audio interfacing for both 
Mac and Windows computers.

10 
Lesson 1 
Audio Interfacing
Audio interface basics
Recording audio into a computer requires converting audio signals into digital 
data that your computer and Audition can recognize. Similarly, playback requires 
converting that digital data back to analog audio so you can hear it. The device that 
performs these conversions is usually called a sound card when built into the com-
puter or audio interface if it’s an external piece of hardware. Both include analog-
to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters. In addition, software driv-
ers handle communications between your computer and audio hardware.
This lesson concentrates on a computer’s on-board audio capabilities, because the 
same concepts translate to more sophisticated (and higher performance) audio 
interfaces. Note that there are many brands and models of audio interfaces, making 
universally applicable lessons impossible. As a result, multiple sidebars in this lesson 
explain audio interface characteristics to provide important background information.
Several lessons are divided into versions for Macintosh and Windows computers. 
You won’t need to read the Windows-specific lessons if you use a Mac, and vice 
versa. However, all users should read the sidebars, because they cover information 
that’s applicable to both platforms.
To make the best use of these lessons, you’ll need the following:
• An audio source, such as an MP3 or CD player with a 1/8-inch minijack 
output (or other device with a suitable adapter to give a 1/8-inch minijack 
output). Laptops may also have an internal microphone you can use; however, 
using a line-level device is recommended, and the lessons will reference that 
type of input. You can also use USB microphones that plug directly into a 
computer’s USB port; however, note that they may introduce significant latency, 
as described later in this lesson, when used as class-compliant devices with 
Windows computers.
• Patch cable with male-to-male 1/8-inch plug to connect the audio source to 
your computer’s audio input jack.
• Your computer’s internal speakers for monitoring or earbuds/headphones with a 
1/8-inch stereo plug suitable for plugging into your computer’s stereo output. You 
can also patch the output to a monitoring system if you have suitable cables.

Adobe AudItIon Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 11
common audio interface connectors
The following are the most common input and output connectors found in comput-
ers and audio interfaces:
• 
XLR jack. This is compatible with microphones and other balanced-line signals. 
Balanced lines use three conductors, which can be designed to minimize hum 
and noise pickup when carrying low-level signals.
• 
1/4-inch phone jack. This is common with musical instruments and much pro 
audio gear. The jack can handle balanced or unbalanced lines; balanced line 
inputs can handle unbalanced lines as well. Headphone jacks also use 1/4-inch 
phone jacks. 
• 
Combo jacks. A fairly recent introduction, a combo jack can accept either an 
XLR or 1/4-inch phone plug.
• 
RCA phono jack. A mainstay of consumer gear, RCA jacks are also found in 
some DJ audio interfaces and video equipment. 
• 
1/8-inch minijack. This is common for on-board computer audio, but rare for 
external interfaces except when included to interface with MP3 players and 
similar consumer devices. The 1/8-inch minijacks sometimes provide headphone 
outputs as well.
• 
S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interconnect Format). This consumer digital 
interface typically uses RCA phono jacks but can also use an optical connector 
and (very rarely) XLR.
• 
AES/EBU (Audio Engineering Society/European Broadcast Union). This is a 
professional-level digital interface that uses XLR connectors. 
• 
ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape) optical. This optical connector carries 
eight channels of digital audio. It’s used most commonly with interfaces for 
expanding the interface’s inputs; for example, if you have an interface that lacks 
sufficient mic inputs but has an ADAT input, eight-channel mic preamps are 
available that send their outputs to an ADAT connector. This allows for easily 
adding eight mic inputs to an existing interface.

Lesson 1 
Audio Interfacing
Mac oS X audio setup
This lesson describes how to configure Audition to work with the Macintosh’s 
inputs and outputs. Apple standardized on Core Audio drivers for Macintosh-
series computers starting with OS X; Macs running earlier operating systems are 
not compatible with Audition.
1 Connect the audio source to the Mac’s 1/8-inch line input jack via the 1/8-inch 
patch cord. If you’re not using internal speakers, plug the earbuds/headphones 
or monitoring system input to the Mac’s line-level output or headphones jack.
2 Open Audition and choose Audition > Preferences > Audio Hardware.
3 Don’t change the Device Class or Master Clock preferences, because they will 
default correctly. The Default Input drop-down menu lists all available audio 
inputs. Choose Built-In Line Input. 
4 The Default Output drop-down menu lists all available audio outputs. If you’re 
using the built-in speaker, choose Built-In Output; for the line-level output, 
choose Built-In Line Output. 
5 I/O Buffer Size determines the system latency. (See the sidebar “About latency 
[computer-based delay]” for more information.) Low values result in less delay 
through the system, whereas higher values increase stability. A value of 512 
samples is a good compromise. 
6 The Sample Rate drop-down menu lists all available sample rates. For most 
Macs, the choices are 44100, 48000, 88200, and 96000kHz; choose 44100, which 
is the standard for CDs. (In theory, higher sample rates improve fidelity, but the 
difference is subtle at best.) Windows computers and external audio interfaces 
generally offer a wider choice of sample rates.
7 Click Settings to open the Mac OS Audio/MIDI Setup dialog box, and then click 
Built-In Line Input.
P Note: Compared 
to the Mac’s Sound 
setup under System 
Preferences, the Audio/
MIDI Setup accessed 
from Audition’s Settings 
button (Preferences > 
Audio Hardware) offers 
additional level controls, 
the option to mute 
inputs, and the ability 
to click on any input or 
output and examine its 
characteristics.

Adobe AudItIon Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 13
The settings will mimic what you set in Preferences (e.g., if you selected a 
44.1kHz sample rate, this will be shown as the sample rate under Format).
8 The other format field specifies Bit Resolution; choose 2-channel, 24-bit. 
9 All Mac OS X audio-related parameters are now set. Close the Audio Devices 
dialog box, and click OK in Audition’s Preferences dialog box.
10 Choose Audition > Preferences > Audio Channel Mapping. This correlates 
Audition’s channels to the hardware inputs and outputs. For example, 
Audition’s 1(L) channel will be mapped to Built-in Output 1. Click OK to 
close this dialog box.
Proceed to the section “Testing inputs and outputs with Audition (Mac or Windows).”
About latency (computer-based delay)
Latency occurs in the conversion process from analog to digital and digital to analog, as well as in the com-
puter—even the most powerful processor can only do so many millions of calculations per second, and 
sometimes can’t keep up. As a result, the computer stores some of the incoming audio in a buffer, which is like 
a savings account for your audio input signal. When the computer is so busy elsewhere that it misses handling 
some incoming audio, it makes a “withdrawal” from the buffer instead.
The larger the buffer (measured in samples or milliseconds), the less likely the computer will run out of audio data 
when it’s needed. But a large buffer also means that the input signal is being diverted for a longer period of time 
before being processed by the computer. As a result, if you listen to the audio coming out of the computer, it will 
be delayed compared to the input. For example, if you’re monitoring your vocals, what you hear in your head-
phones will be delayed compared to what you’re singing, and this can be distracting. Reducing the Sample Buffer 
value minimizes delay at the expense of system stability (you may hear clicking or popping at low latencies). 
P Note: The mapped 
defaults seldom need to 
be changed; however, 
you can remap if (for 
example) you were 
given a file where the 
right and left channels 
were accidentally 
reversed: Map 
Audition’s 1(L) channel 
to the Built-in Output 2, 
which connects to the 
physical right output.

14 
Lesson 1 
Audio Interfacing
Bit resolution
Bit resolution expresses the accuracy with which the analog-to-digital converter 
measures the input signal. A good analogy is pixels and images: The more pixels in 
images of the same size, the more detail you’ll see in the picture.
CDs use 16-bit resolution, which means that audio voltages are defined with an 
accuracy of approximately 1 part in 65,536. A resolution of 20- or 24-bit provides 
a higher level of accuracy, but as with higher sample rates, higher bit resolution 
requires more storage: A 24-bit file is 50 percent larger than a 16-bit file if both are at 
the same sample rate. Unlike higher sample rates, few dispute that 24-bit recording 
sounds better than 16-bit recording.
Recording at 44.1kHz with 24-bit resolution is a common trade-off among storage 
space, ease of use, and fidelity.
Windows setup
Unlike newer Macs, Windows systems typically have several drivers: legacy drivers 
(primarily MME and DirectSound) for backward compatibility and higher-perfor-
mance drivers (WDM/KS, which is different from yet another driver type called 
WDM). However, for Windows music applications, the most popular high-perfor-
mance audio driver is ASIO (Advanced Stream Input/Output), created by software 
developer Steinberg. Virtually all professional audio interfaces include ASIO driv-
ers, and many include WDM/KS drivers. 
Unfortunately, ASIO is not part of the Windows operating system, so for these 
lessons you’ll use the MME (Multimedia Extensions) protocol. It has relatively high 
latency but is stable and predictable. Experienced computer users can download 
the general-purpose ASIO driver ASIO4ALL, which is available free of charge from 
www.asio4all.com. It is the de facto ASIO driver for laptop owners who want to use 
ASIO with internal sound chips. Although you’ll use MME for now, with a profes-
sional audio interface, use the ASIO or WDM/KS drivers provided with it, or as an 
alternative, ASIO4ALL.
1 Windows motherboards typically have both mic and line 1/8-inch inputs. 
Connect the audio source to the computer’s 1/8-inch line input jack via the 1/8-
inch patch cord. 
2 If you’re not using internal speakers, plug the earbuds/headphones or 
monitoring system input to the computer’s line-level output.
3 Proceed to the section describing the operating system you’re using.
E Tip: If there’s a 
microphone input 
and you’re not using 
it, make sure it’s not 
selected (or its fader 
is down) to prevent 
it from contributing 
any noise.

Adobe AudItIon Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 15
Audition on the Mac vs. Windows
Using Audition on the Mac versus using it on Windows was once a hot topic, but over 
time, the operating systems and associated hardware have become more alike. Once 
you open Audition, for all practical purposes, it operates identically on both platforms. 
Each platform has strengths and limitations. The Mac handles audio transparently, 
avoiding the multiple drivers found with Windows. However, independent bench-
marks show that all other factors being equal, Windows 7 can apply more power to 
audio projects than OS X. Realistically, though, with today’s computers the situation 
is analogous to saying that a car capable of going 270 mph is more powerful than a 
car that tops out at 250 mph—yet you probably won’t drive over 90 mph anyway.
Ultimately, if there are Mac-only or Windows-only programs that are essential for 
what you do, that will tend to dictate which platform is best. The reality is that both 
platforms have pretty much reached parity, and either will run Audition equally well.
Windows 7 (32- or 64-bit) assignments
This lesson describes how to configure Audition to work with a typical Windows 7 
machine’s inputs and outputs.
1 In Windows, choose Start > Control Panel, and then in the Control panel 
double-click the Sound icon.
2 Click the Playback tab. Click either Speakers or Headphones, depending on 
what you have plugged into the computer’s output jack. After clicking the 
appropriate choice, click the Set Default button to make this your default 
audio output. 
3 Click the Sound dialog box’s Recording tab.
E Tip: Click the Sound 
Playback dialog box’s 
Properties to bring up 
a dialog box where you 
can click the Levels tab 
and adjust the volume 
and balance, and also 
mute the output.

16 
Lesson 1 
Audio Interfacing
4 Click Line In, and then click Set Default. Click the Sounds tab, and for Sound 
Scheme, choose No Sounds—it’s distracting to hear system sounds while you’re 
working with audio. Click OK.
Windows XP assignments
This lesson describes how to configure Audition to work with a typical Windows XP 
machine’s inputs and outputs. Note that Windows XP is no longer recommended for 
most modern music programs, because several improvements have been made in 
Windows 7 with respect to handling audio, memory management, and hard disks.
1 In Windows, choose Start > Control Panel, and then in the Control panel 
double-click the Sound and Audio Devices icon.
2 Click the Audio tab. Choose the desired input and output devices from the 
Sound Playback Default device and Sound Recording Default device drop-down 
menus, respectively. 
E Tip: Click the Sound 
Recording dialog box’s 
Properties to bring up 
a dialog box where you 
can click the Levels tab 
and adjust the volume 
and balance, and also 
mute the input.

Adobe AudItIon Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 17
3 To adjust the input volume, click the Volume button in the Sound Recording 
section. A small mixer appears; select the Stereo Mix Select check box, and use 
the associated fader to adjust the input levels. 
4 To adjust the output volume, click the Volume tab. A master fader lets you 
adjust the volume; select the “Place volume icon in the taskbar” check box to 
be able to adjust the output volume without having to open any windows or 
dialog boxes. 
5 Click the Sound dialog box’s Recording tab.
6 Click the desired input (for a laptop, this will often show Stereo Mix), and then 
click Set Default. Click the Sounds tab, and for Sound Scheme, choose No 
Sounds—it’s distracting to hear system sounds while you’re working with audio. 
Click OK.
Audition settings for Windows audio 
Now that the computer has been configured properly for the audio inputs and 
outputs, you need to configure settings in Audition as well.
1 Open Audition, and choose Edit > Preferences > Audio Hardware.
2 From the Device Class drop-down menu, choose MME.
E Tip: If there’s a 
microphone input 
and you’re not using 
it, make sure it’s not 
selected, or its fader is 
down, to prevent it from 
contributing any noise.

18 
Lesson 1 
Audio Interfacing
3 From the Default Input drop-down menu, choose the default input device (Line 
In) you specified previously; from the Default Output drop-down menu, choose 
the default output device (Speaker or Headphones) you specified previously. Do 
not change the Master Clock preference. 
4 Latency determines the delay through the computer. Low values result in less 
delay through the system, whereas high values increase stability. A value of 
200ms is “safe” for most computers.
5 The Sample Rate drop-down menu lists all available sample rates. Most 
Windows internal audio chips offer a wide variety of sample rates, often from 
6000Hz to 192000Hz. Choose 44100 (in theory, higher sample rates improve 
fidelity, although few people can hear a difference). External audio interfaces 
typically offer fewer options that are intended for professional audio and video 
projects. After selecting the Sample Rate, click OK.
6 Choose Edit > Preferences > Audio Channel Mapping. This correlates Audition’s 
channels to the hardware inputs and outputs. For example, Audition’s 1(L) 
channel will be mapped to Line 1. Click OK to close this dialog box.
common sample rates
Different sample rates are typically used for different applications. This list covers the 
most common sample rates used for pro audio:
• 
32,000 (32kHz). Typically used for digital broadcast and satellite transmissions.
• 
44,100 (44.1kHz). The sample rate for CDs and most consumer digital audio.
• 
48,000 (48kHz). The most common sample rate used in broadcast video.
• 
88,200 (88.2kHz). Some engineers claim this sounds better than 44.1kHz but is 
rarely used.
• 
96,000 (96kHz). Sometimes used in DVDs and other high-end audio recording 
processes.
• 
176,400 and 192,000 (176.4 and 192kHz). These ultra-high sample rates 
generate much larger files and stress your computer more, yet offer no 
significant audio advantage.
P Note: The mapped 
defaults for channel 
mapping seldom 
need to be changed. 
However, you can 
remap if (for example) 
you were given a file 
where the right and 
left channels were 
accidentally reversed: 
Map Audition’s 1(L) 
channel to the Built-in 
Output 2, which 
connects to the physical 
right output.

Adobe AudItIon Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 19
testing inputs and outputs with 
Audition (Mac or Windows)
Because you already specified default inputs and outputs in the previous lessons, 
Audition will default to using these for recording and playback. Now you’ll test 
these connections to ensure that the inputs and outputs are set up properly.
1 Choose File > New > Audio File to create a new file in the Waveform Editor. 
A dialog box opens.
2 Name the file. The sample rate should default to the value you selected in 
Preferences.
3 Choose the number of channels. Their inputs will default to what you specified 
in Preferences. If you choose Mono, only the first channel of the input channel 
pair will be recorded. 
4 The bit depth represents the project’s internal bit depth, not the bit resolution of 
your interface’s converters. This resolution will be used to calculate changes in 
volume, effects, and the like, so choose the highest resolution, which is 32 (float).
5 Click OK to close the dialog box. 
6 Click the Transport Record button, and then start playback from your audio 
source. If all connections are defined and all levels set properly, you’ll see a 
waveform being drawn in the Waveform Editor window. Record several seconds 
of audio.
7 Click the Move Playhead to Previous button in the Transport, or drag the 
playhead (also called the current time indicator [CTI]) back to the beginning 
of the file. Click Play, and you should hear what you recorded in your chosen 
output device (internal speakers, earbuds, headphones, or monitoring system). 
Click the Transport Stop button to end playback.

20 
Lesson 1 
Audio Interfacing
8 Now test recording and playback in the Multitrack Editor. Choose File > New > 
Multitrack session. A dialog box opens.
9 Name the file. For Template, choose None. The sample rate should default to the 
value you selected in Preferences.
10 As with the Waveform Editor, choose the highest resolution of 32 (float), and 
then choose the number of output channels (Stereo) for the Master Track. 
11 Click OK to close the dialog box. 
12 Arm a track by clicking the R (Record) button. Start playing your audio source; 
the channel’s meter should indicate signal. Note that the input will connect 
automatically to the default input; however, if you click the input field’s right 
arrow, you can choose just one input for mono tracks or you can open the 
hardware section under Preferences if you have a multi-input audio interface 
and want to choose an input other than the default.
13 Click the Transport Record button. If all connections are defined and all 
levels set properly, you’ll see a waveform being drawn in the Multitrack Editor 
window. Record several seconds of audio.
14 Click the Transport Move Playhead to Previous button, or drag the playhead 
(CTI) back to the beginning of the file. Click Play, and you should hear what you 
recorded in your chosen output device (internal speakers, earbuds, headphones, 
or monitoring system). Click the Transport Stop button to end playback.

using external interfaces
It’s not possible to present an exercise in this lesson, because there is no way to 
know what interface you’re using. However, keep the following in mind when 
you’re using external interfaces:
• Professional interfaces usually have capabilities beyond those offered by 
internal audio and therefore have their own control panels for routing signals, 
controlling levels, and the like.
• Interfaces often have more than one set of stereo inputs and outputs. When 
you’re choosing default inputs and outputs, you’ll have a much wider selection 
compared to using a computer’s internal sound capabilities.
• With interfaces that provide USB 2.0 and FireWire connections, try both on 
extended sessions to determine if one option works better than the other.
• Windows USB interfaces can be class-compliant, meaning they don’t need 
custom drivers. However, always use the custom ASIO or WDM drivers 
provided with an interface for maximum functionality and minimum latency.
• With Windows computers, never use a driver called “emulated,” such as “ASIO 
(emulated).” These result in the worst performance of all possible drivers.
• Some interfaces include a feature called zero-latency monitoring. This means 
the input can be mixed directly to the output, and the mixing is typically 
controlled by using an applet that shows up onscreen to bypass any latency 
caused by going through the computer. 
• With ASIO interfaces, Audition will default to monopolizing any sound 
capabilities. To access the ASIO interface in other applications that are running, 
select the “Release ASIO driver in background” check box in Audition’s 
Preferences > Audio Hardware dialog box. Giving the other application the 
focus will allow it use the ASIO interface, unless Audition is recording.

Lesson 1 
Audio Interfacing
Audio interface/computer  
connections
There are several ways external audio interfaces communicate with a computer: 
• 
USB. USB 2.0 can stream up to dozens of audio channels over a single cable that 
connects between the interface and a computer’s USB port. USB 1.1 interfaces 
are also available for less-demanding applications and can typically stream 
six channels of audio, making them suitable for surround. Class-compliant 
interfaces are plug-and-play, but most professional interfaces use specialized 
drivers to improve speed and efficiency.
• 
FireWire. Like USB, this also connects the interface to your computer with a 
cable, although the connector configuration is different than USB. Although 
still common, FireWire has been eclipsed somewhat by USB for several reasons: 
Many laptops no longer include FireWire ports, most audio interfaces require 
specific FireWire chip sets, and the performance advantage FireWire once 
offered was more relevant when computers weren’t as powerful. Some audio 
interfaces include both FireWire and USB 2.0.
• 
PCIe card. This plugs directly into a computer’s motherboard, so it provides the 
most direct pathway to a computer. However, this option is less common because 
USB and FireWire offer more convenience—you don’t need to physically open the 
computer to install the card—with virtually no performance decrease.
• 
ExpressCard. This is suitable for plugging into laptops that have ExpressCard 
slots, but again, is ceding its role to USB or FireWire interfaces. 
• 
Thunderbolt. This interface protocol, which carries data over a cable, is just 
starting to appear in computers; few Thunderbolt-compatible interfaces 
are available as of this writing. However, Thunderbolt promises PCIe-type 
performance and compatibility with existing audio interfaces, as well as 
dedicated Thunderbolt interfaces.

review questions
1 What are the most popular driver protocols for Mac and Windows?
2 What is an unavoidable, negative by-product of working with computer-based audio?
3 How can you minimize latency?
4 What are the advantages and disadvantages of high sample rates and high bit 
resolutions?
5 Although many external audio interfaces include ASIO drivers, the Windows operating 
system does not. How can you use ASIO with laptop sound chips?
review answers
1 Core Audio for the Mac and ASIO for Windows are the most popular driver protocols 
for pro audio.
2 System latency causes a time delay between the output and what’s being recorded at 
the input.
3 Change the number of sample buffers to alter latency. Using the smallest number 
possible, consistent with the audio not producing clicks or pops, provides 
minimum latency.
4 High sample rates and bit resolutions have the potential to deliver better audio quality 
but create larger audio files and stress the computer more than lower rates and 
resolutions.
5 Free driver software, ASIO4ALL, provides ASIO drivers for sound hardware that was 
not designed for ASIO compatibility.

The AudiTion environmenT 
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Create custom workspaces for particular workflows 
• Arrange panels and frames for optimum workflow
• Use the Media Browser to find files in your computer 
• Listen to files before loading them using the Media Browser’s 
Playback Preview function
• Create shortcuts to frequently used folders
• Navigate to specific sections of a file in the Waveform Editor or 
a Session in the Multitrack Editor
• Use markers to create points you can jump to immediately in the 
Waveform Editor or a Session in the Multitrack Editor
• Use zooming to focus in on particular sections in the Waveform 
or Multitrack Editor
This lesson takes about 60 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve 
copied the Lesson02 folder that contains the project examples into the 
Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

25
You can create custom workspaces with particular 
selections of windows and window arrangements, 
as well as choose various ways to navigate through 
Audition’s Waveform Editor and Multitrack Editor.

26 
Lesson 2 The Audition environment
Audition’s dual personality 
A unique aspect of Audition is that it combines the functionality of two programs 
within a single piece of software:
• A Waveform Editor that can perform highly detailed and sophisticated editing
• A Multitrack Editor for creating multitrack music productions
In addition, the two sections are interrelated in that audio can move freely between 
the two environments. Audio in the Multitrack Editor can be transferred to the 
Waveform Editor for detailed editing and then transferred back. Files brought into 
the Waveform Editor can be tweaked prior to making them the basis of a multi-
track project.
Both editors have highly customizable workspaces that you can optimize for any 
of Audition’s uses—not just editing or multitrack productions but also audio for 
video, sound library development, audio restoration, sound effects creation, and 
even forensics. This lesson concentrates on the Waveform Editor, but operations in 
the Multitrack Editor are similar, and in many cases, identical.
The editing/multitracking  
connection
Traditionally, multitrack recording programs and digital audio editing programs 
were separate and optimized for their specific tasks (in fact, Audition started as a 
digital audio editor with no multitracking capabilities). Inherently, both types of 
programs are quite different: Multitrack recorders can have dozens of tracks, or even 
over a hundred, and therefore require effects that minimize CPU power consump-
tion (because so many tracks will incorporate effects), and both mixing and automa-
tion are extremely important. Digital audio editors deal with a limited number of 
tracks—usually just stereo audio—don’t require mixing, and tend to have “master-
ing quality” effects that use a lot of CPU power.
What’s interesting about Audition is that it doesn’t just stick two isolated programs 
together but instead integrates them. There are often occasions when working with 
a multitrack recording where you need to do detailed editing on a track. This would 
normally require exporting the file, opening it in a second program, editing it, and 
then reimporting it back into the multitrack recording software. With Audition, 
you just click on the Waveform Editor, and all the tracks in the Multitrack Editor are 
already loaded and available. When you export a mixdown of a Multitrack Session, it 
also loads automatically into the Waveform Editor so you can master it, save it as an 
MP3 file (or other Internet-friendly format), or even burn it to an audio CD. 
This fluid movement between the two environments improves workflow. And 
another advantage is that the two sections have similar user interfaces, so you don’t 
have to learn two separate programs.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 27
The Audition Workspace 
Audition’s Workspace, which is consistent with other Adobe video and graph-
ics applications so you needn’t learn multiple user interfaces, consists of multiple 
windows. You choose which windows make up a workspace, and you can add or 
remove them at any time. For example, you don’t need a video window if you’re not 
doing an audio-for-video project, but you’ll need it if you’re creating a soundtrack. 
Or, when you’re creating a multitrack project, you may need the Media Browser 
open to locate files you want to use, but when mixing, you can close the Media 
Browser to create space for inserting other windows. You can also save a particular 
window setup as a workspace.
Once windows are brought into a workspace, they are arranged as frames and panels. 
Frames and panels
Frames and panels are the main elements in a workspace, and you can rearrange 
them to suit your particular needs.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson02 folder, and open the file 
WaveformWorkspace.aif.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Classic.
3 To make sure the workspace uses the stored version, choose Window > 
Workspace > Reset Classic.
P Note: When you 
open Audition, it opens 
to the last workspace 
you were using. You can 
modify a workspace as 
much as you want, but 
always revert to the 
original version you 
created (as described 
later) by choosing 
Window > Workspace > 
Reset [name of 
workspace].

28 
Lesson 2 The Audition environment
4 A dialog box asks if you want to reset Classic to its original layout. Click Yes.
5 Click on the waveform, which is within the waveform’s Editor panel. When you 
click in a panel, a yellow line outlines the panel. 
6 If you want to see more of the waveform’s Editor panel, click the panel’s left 
yellow line, and drag to the left to widen the panel. 
7 Increase the panel’s height by clicking the panel’s lower line and dragging 
down. However, this may cause the panels below the waveform to disappear 
or become narrow enough to be unusable. So, return the panel’s lower line to 
where it was, and then start to customize the workspace.
Every panel has a tab toward the top of it. The right part of the tab has a Close 
box, which closes the panel (you can always reopen a panel from the Window 
menu if you need it later).
8 The Selection/View panel probably isn’t needed right now, so click its Close box 
to open up some more space. Note how the Zoom panel expands to take up 
the space.
Every panel is housed in a frame. You can save space by grouping several panels 
into the same frame to create a collection of panels that has tabs across the top 
for bringing a particular panel to the “front” of the frame.
9 On the left part of a panel’s tab is a gripper; click the Time panel’s gripper and 
drag it next to the Zoom panel’s tab. A strip containing this tab turns blue to 
indicate it is a “drop zone” where a panel can be dropped.
P Note: Panels can 
have divider lines at 
the top, bottom, right, 
and/or left. If a divider 
icon appears when you 
hover over one of these 
lines, you can click and 
drag to resize the panel. 
You can also resize the 
entire workspace by 
clicking on any edge 
and dragging.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 29
10 Release the mouse button; the Time and Zoom panels are now within a 
tabbed frame.
11 Click the Transport panel’s gripper, and drag it into the blue drop zone strip 
that already has the Zoom and Time tabs. Now the Zoom, Transport, and Time 
panels are all within a tabbed frame.
12 Click the Zoom tab, then the Time tab, and then the Transport tab. Note that 
the original double rows of buttons are now single rows, which allows more 
space for increasing the Editor panel height.
13 With the Transport tab showing, click in the Editor panel. Click its lower yellow 
line and drag down until the Transport panel is just high enough to show all the 
buttons. Click the Time tab and then the Zoom tab, and note that they’ve also 
been resized to fit.
14 To create even more space, move the Levels panel to the left of the Audition 
Workspace. Click the Levels panel gripper, and drag it to the Audition 
Workspace’s left edge.
15 Now you can drag the bottom of the Editor panel down even further.
P Note: With narrow 
frames containing 
multiple tabs, a tab’s 
Close box may not 
be visible. You can 
close tabs via a frame’s 
drop-down menu, 
which is accessible 
toward the frame’s 
upper-right corner.
P Note: You can click 
and drag on a tab to 
change its position 
among the other tabs.
P Note: There are 
three green drop 
zones on the left, 
right, bottom, and top 
edges of the Audition 
Workspace. These are 
different from the blue 
drop zones because 
anything dropped into 
these green drop zones 
will extend to the main 
window’s full length 
or height.

30 
Lesson 2 The Audition environment
Adding a new panel
So far, you’ve rearranged existing panels within a workspace. However, you can also 
add a new panel to a frame.
1 Currently, the Files and Effects Rack panels are in a single frame. This would be 
a convenient frame for placing the Media Browser panel, so add it to the frame.
2 Click a panel in this frame, like Files.
3 Choose Window > Media Browser. The Media Browser is added to the frame. 
However, note that the frame is narrower and you can no longer see all three 
tabs. When this happens, Audition adds a scroll bar just above the frame.
4 Click the scroll bar and drag left and right to reveal the various tabs.
dragging panels and frames into panel drop zones
When you click a gripper and drag a panel over another panel, blue “drop zones” 
appear that indicate where the panel can be dropped. There are five main drop zones.
If the panel drop zone is in the panel center, dropping a panel there is equivalent to 
dropping it into the bar with the tabs. However, if the panel drop zone shows a bar 
with beveled edges, the frame will land where the bar is and push the panel with 
the bar over to make room. 
P Note: If your mouse 
has a scroll wheel, you 
can also hover over any 
frame tab and scroll 
from tab to tab using 
the mouse scroll wheel.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 31
The frame with the Media Browser, Effects Rack, and Files seems unnecessarily tall, 
and the space at the bottom isn’t really necessary. That would be a good place to 
drag the Time panel.
1 Click the Time panel gripper, and drag it toward the Effects Rack. As it passes 
over the bottom of the Effects Rack panel, you’ll see a blue bar with beveled edges.
You can also drag frames into drop zones; the frame gripper is in the frame’s 
upper-right corner. Suppose you decide you’d rather have the Time panel above 
the frame with the Media Browser, Effects Rack, and Files panels. You could 
drag the Time panel into the frame’s upper beveled bar, but there’s another 
way. Neither option is inherently superior, but you might prefer one workflow 
over the other.
2 Click the frame’s gripper, and drag it into the Time panel’s lower bar. 

32 
Lesson 2 The Audition environment
The Frame drop-down menu
Every frame has a drop-down menu in the upper-right corner. This menu always 
contains at least five options:
• Undock Panel
• Undock Frame
• Close Panel (same as clicking a tab’s Close box)
• Close Frame 
• Maximize Frame 
There may also be options that relate to specific panels. For example, the Media 
Browser panel drop-down menu has options for Enable Auto-Play, Enable 
Loop Preview, and Show Preview Transport. This is handy because even if the 
Preview Transport isn’t shown, it’s still possible to enable its Auto-Play and 
Loop Preview functions.
Undocking allows you to “float” a panel or frame outside of the main window. 
Here’s how it works.
1 Click the drop-down menu for the frame containing the Media Browser, Files, 
and Effects Rack panels. 
2 Choose Undock Frame.
The frame becomes a separate window that can be moved independently of the 
Audition Workspace and resized.
3 Click the Media Browser panel.
4 Click the drop-down menu of the frame containing the Media Browser panel.
5 Choose Undock Panel. Now there are three separate windows—the Audition 
Workspace, the frame with the Files and Effects Rack panels, and the Media 
Browser panel.
P Note: You can 
undock a frame or 
panel by clicking its 
gripper and dragging 
the gripper outside the 
Audition Workspace.
P Note: After 
undocking frames or 
panels, they will still 
have grippers that you 
can use to re-dock them 
as you would any other 
frame or panel.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 33
Tools panel
The Tools panel has some unique attributes compared to the other panels. 
1 The Tools panel defaults to being a toolbar—a thin strip of buttons along the 
top of the Audition Workspace—and has no drop-down menu. Undock it 
by clicking the gripper in the upper-left corner and dragging it outside the 
Audition Workspace.
When undocked, the toolbar takes on the characteristics of a panel: It’s housed 
within a frame, can be combined with other panels within the frame, and 
contains a frame drop-down menu. It also includes two extra fields—a drop-
down menu for choosing a workspace that duplicates the Window > Workspace 
path and a search box.
P Note: The Status 
Bar at the bottom 
of the workspace is 
the one element that 
is permanent and 
cannot be floated or 
docked (however, you 
can choose whether 
to show or hide it by 
choosing View > Status 
Bar > Show). The Status 
Bar shows statistics 
about file size, bit 
resolution, sample rate, 
duration, available disk 
space, and the like.

34 
Lesson 2 The Audition environment
2 Re-dock the toolbar along the top of the Audition Workspace before proceeding, 
and then close Audition.
Create and save custom workspaces
You are not limited to the workspaces that are included with Audition and can  
create you own.
1 Arrange the workspace exactly as desired.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > New Workspace.
3 Name the workspace by typing a name into the New Workspace dialog box, and 
then click OK. Your workspace now joins the list of current workspaces.
4 To delete a workspace, choose Window > Workspace and select a workspace 
other than the one you want to delete.
5 Choose Window > Workspace > Delete Workspace.
6 When the Delete Workspace dialog box appears, choose the workspace you 
want to delete from the drop-down menu, and then click OK.
navigation
There are three main elements to navigation:
• Navigating to desired files and projects so you can open them, typically using 
Audition’s Media Browser
• Navigation related to playing back and recording audio within the Waveform 
Editor and Multitrack Editor
• Navigating visually within the Waveform Editor and Multitrack Editor (zooming 
in and out to specific parts of the file)
navigating to files and projects
For both Mac and Windows, Audition adopts standard navigation menu proto-
cols (such as Open and Open Recent) for navigating within the computer to find 
specific files and projects. The only significant departure is the Open Append menu 
option, which relates mostly to the Waveform Editor. 
1 Open Audition, navigate to the Lesson02 folder, and open the file 
WaveformWorkspace.aif.
2 Choose File > Open Append > To Current.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 35
3 Navigate to the Lesson02 folder, choose String_Harp.wav, and in the dialog box, 
click Open.
4 The file you selected is appended to the end of the current waveform in the 
Waveform Editor.
5 Choose File > Open Append > To New.
6 Navigate to the Lesson02 folder, choose String_Harp.wav, and open it.
7 The file you selected is opened in a new Waveform Editor view. It does not 
replace the previously loaded file, and you can select either one with the Editor 
panel’s drop-down menu.
8 Choose File > Close All, but leave Audition open in preparation for the next lesson.
P Note: You can 
choose Open Append > 
To New in the Multitrack 
Editor; however, this will 
simply open the file in 
the Waveform Editor, not 
the Multitrack Editor.

36 
Lesson 2 The Audition environment
navigating with the media Browser
The Media Browser is an enhanced version of the browsing options offered in the 
Windows and Macintosh operating systems. If you use Windows, it works simi-
larly to the standard Windows Explorer. If you use the Mac, the Media Browser 
resembles the list view browser in the left column, but selecting a folder in the left 
column opens its contents in the right column, like the Mac Finder’s column view.
Once you locate a file, you can drag it into the Waveform Editor or Multitrack 
Editor window.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Default. 
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Default. Click Yes when the confirmation 
dialog box appears.
3 Click the Media Browser’s gripper and drag it outside of the workspace to float 
it. This isn’t strictly necessary, but this makes it easy to extend the size to see 
all the available options in the Media Browser. Drag the window to the right 
to extend it.
4 The left Media Browser column shows all the drives mounted to your computer. 
Clicking on any of these displays its contents in the right column. You can also 
click a drive’s disclosure triangle to reveal its contents.
5 In the left column, navigate to the Lesson02 folder. Click its disclosure triangle 
to expand it, and then click the Moebius_120BPM_F# folder.
The folder’s audio files are shown in the right column. Note how additional 
subcolumns show file attributes, such as duration, sample rate, channels, 
and more. 
E Tip: The Locations 
drop-down menu in the 
upper left, above the 
list of your computer’s 
drives, lets you select 
any drive. Its contents 
appear immediately in 
the right column.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 37
6 You can change subcolumn widths. Click the divider line between two 
subcolumns, and drag left or right to change width. 
7 You can rearrange the order of subcolumns. Click a column name, like Media 
Type. Drag it left or right to position it. This feature is helpful because you can 
drag the columns containing the information you need the most to the left side, 
so the data is visible even if the window isn’t fully extended to the right.
8 For providing single-click access to specific folders, the Media Browser offers 
a “virtual drive” along with the other computer drives in the left column 
that contains shortcuts for often-used folders. To create a shortcut for the 
Moebius_120BPM_F# folder, click it in the left column.
9 In the right column, click the + symbol and choose Add Shortcut for 
“Moebius_120BPM_F#.”
10 Look in the left column, and click the Shortcuts disclosure triangle. Your 
shortcut now provides one-click access to the designated folder.
11 Another Media Browser advantage is that you can listen to the files as you 
browse, thanks to the Preview Transport. If it’s not visible, select Show Preview 
Transport from the upper-right drop-down menu. Click the Auto-Play button 
with the speaker icon, and you’ll hear a file play when you click it.
	
P Note: If enabled, 
the Loop Playback 
button to the left of 
the Auto-Play button 
will cause the file to 
play back until you 
either choose another 
file or click the Stop 
button to the left of the 
Loop Playback button. 
If you don’t want 
Auto-Play but want 
to play files manually, 
deselect Auto-Play and 
click the Play button 
(which toggles with 
the Stop button) to 
start playback.

38 
Lesson 2 The Audition environment
navigating within files and Sessions
Once you’re in the Waveform Editor or Multitrack Editor, you’ll want to be able to 
navigate within the Editor to locate or edit specific sections. Audition has several 
tools that you can use to do this.
1 Open Audition, navigate to the Lesson02 folder, and open the file 
WaveformWorkspace.aif.
2 Click the Editor window’s gripper and drag it outside of the workspace to float 
the window.
3 Click the Workspace’s lower-left corner and drag diagonally down toward the 
right until you can see all the Transport and Zoom buttons. Then click around 
a third of the way into the waveform and drag to about two-thirds of the way 
through the waveform to create a selection. The orange icon at the beginning of 
the selection is called the current time indicator (CTI), or playhead in previous 
versions of Audition.
navigation via zooming
Zooming acts the same way it does with a camera: Zoom out to see more of an 
object, and zoom in to see more detail. The Waveform Editor includes zoom but-
tons, but you can also open a Zoom panel with these same eight buttons if you 
want to position them elsewhere or float them. The Multitrack Editor includes 
these same zoom buttons.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 39
1 The Zoom toolbar consists of eight buttons that control zooming. Click two 
times on the leftmost Zoom In (Amplitude) button. Zooming in on amplitude 
lets you see low-level signals more easily.
2 Click twice on the next button to the right, the Zoom Out (Amplitude) button. 
This returns you to the previous amplitude zoom level.
3 Click eight times on the next button to the right, the Zoom In (Time) button. 
This lets you see very short sections of time on the waveform. 
4 Click twice on the next button to the right, the Zoom Out (Time) button. This 
lets you zoom back out.
5 Click once on the next button to the right, the Zoom Out Full (All Axes) button. 
This is a “shortcut” button that zooms out the time and amplitude axes to 
maximum so you can see the complete waveform. 
6 Click the next button to the right, the Zoom In at In Point button. This places 
the selection start (In point) in the middle of the waveform. 
7 Click the next button to the right, the Zoom In at Out Point button. This places 
the selection end (Out point) in the middle of the waveform. 
8 Click the rightmost button, the Zoom to Selection button. This causes the 
selection to fill the window.
9 Click the Zoom Out Full button (the third from the right) to return both axes to 
zoomed out full.
10 There’s an additional Zoom tool at the top of the window that shows a global 
view of your audio file. Drag the left or right side of the yellow grabber to zoom 
in or out of an area; the area between the two yellow grabbers is what you’ll 
see in the Editor. Note that you can click the grabber in the middle of the two 
yellow bars to move the zoom area left or right.
11 To reset the zoom back to the see the entire audio waveform, click the Zoom 
Out Full button to the right of the upper zoom tool. Close Audition without 
saving anything.
P Note: If you zoom in 
all the way using Zoom 
In (Time), you can see—
as well as edit—the 
individual samples that 
make up the waveform. 

40 
Lesson 2 The Audition environment
Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts can help tremendously with navigation. Once you’ve memo-
rized important shortcuts, it takes less effort to press a couple of keys than to locate 
a specific area on the screen, move your mouse to it, access a menu, select an item, 
and so on.
Audition even lets you create your own keyboard shortcuts for the various com-
mands. Choose Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts, or press Alt+K (Option+K), and then 
follow the onscreen directions to add and remove shortcuts.
navigation with markers
You can place markers (also called cues) within the Waveform Editor and 
Multitrack Editor to indicate specific places you want to navigate to immediately. 
For example, in a Multitrack project, you might place markers before a verse and 
chorus so you can jump back and forth between them. In the Waveform Editor, you 
might place markers to indicate places where edits are required. 
1 Open Audition, navigate to the Lesson02 folder, and open the file 
WaveformWorkspace.aif.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset “Default.” Click Yes to confirm.
3 Choose Window > Markers. The Marker panel appears. 
4 Click in the waveform toward the beginning, around 1.0 second. 
5 Press M. This adds a marker at the playhead (CTI) location and adds the marker 
to the list of markers in the marker window.
6 Now click in the waveform around 3.0 seconds. As an alternate way to add a 
marker, click the Add Cue Marker button in the Markers panel. 
7 You can also mark a selection. Click around 5.0 and drag right to 6.0 to create a 
selection. Press M to mark the selection. Note that the Markers panel shows a 
different symbol to indicate this Range marker is marking a selection.
P Note: You can 
rename a marker by 
right-clicking (Control-
clicking) on its white 
handle in the Waveform 
Editor and choosing 
Rename Marker. Or you 
can click on the marker 
name in the Markers 
panel, click again after a 
slight pause (you don’t 
want to double-click), 
and then type in a new 
name. Renaming with 
either method renames 
both instances of 
the marker.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 41
8 You can also convert the Range markers to an individual marker at the selection 
start. Right-click (Control-click) on either the start or end of the Range marker, 
and then choose Convert to Point.
9 There are several ways to navigate among markers. Double-click the first marker 
in the Markers panel list, and the playhead jumps to that marker. Double-click the 
last marker in the Marker panels list, and the playhead jumps to the last marker.
10 Another method for marker navigation involves the Transport. We’ll talk about 
that next. Leave Audition open in preparation for the next lesson.
navigation with the Transport
The Transport offers several navigation options, including navigation using markers.
1 Click the Move Playhead to Previous button. The playhead moves to Marker 2.
2 Click the Move Playhead to Previous button again. The playhead moves to 
Marker 1. Click the Move Playhead to Previous button once more, and the 
playhead moves to the beginning of the file.
3 Click the Move Playhead to Next button (the button to the left of the Record 
button with the red dot) four times. The playhead steps to each marker until it 
reaches the end of the file.
P Note: If a file 
contains no markers, 
Move Playhead to Next 
jumps to the end; Move 
Playhead to Previous 
jumps to the beginning. 
In the Multitrack Editor, 
clip start and end 
points are automatically 
considered markers by 
the Transport’s Move 
Playhead to Next and 
Move Playhead to 
Previous buttons.

Lesson 2 The Audition environment
4 To move the playhead backward in the file without dragging the playhead or 
using markers, click and hold the Rewind button until the playhead is in the 
desired location. You’ll hear audio during the scrolling process. Rewind back to 
the beginning.
5 Click the Play button (the second Transport button from the left with the right 
arrow). Playback begins.
6 As soon as the playhead passes the first marker, click the Move Playhead 
To Next Button. The playhead jumps to the second marker. Click the Move 
Playhead To Next button again, and the playhead jumps to the third marker. 
7 Right-click (Control-click) the Transport Play button and choose Return 
Playhead to Start Position on Stop. With this option selected, clicking Stop 
will return the playhead to where it started. With this option deselected, the 
playhead will stop at the position it had when you clicked the Stop button.
P Note: The Fast 
Forward button to the 
right of the Rewind 
button works similarly 
to the Rewind button 
but moves the playhead 
forward in the file. Note 
that you can right-click 
(Control-click) on either 
button to set the speed 
with which it moves.
P Note: The Rewind, 
Fast Forward, Move 
Playhead To Next, Move 
Playback to Previous, 
and of course Stop can 
all be invoked during 
playback.

Basic Editing 
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Select a portion of a waveform for editing
• Cut, copy, paste, mix, and remove silence audio. Learn to eliminate 
unwanted sounds
• Use multiple clipboards to assemble final audio from individual clips
• Extend and shorten pieces of music
• Add new sounds to an existing piece of music using Mix Paste
• Create loops with music files
• Fade audio regions to create smooth transitions, and remove pops 
and clicks
This lesson takes about 75 minutes to complete. Copy the Lesson03 
folder into the Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for 
these projects (or create it now), if you haven’t already done so. Don’t 
be concerned about modifying these files; you can always return to 
the original versions by copying them from the Adobe Audition CS6 
Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

45
Audition makes it easy to cut, paste, copy, trim, fade, 
and perform other processes on audio files. You can 
zoom in to make extremely precise edits, while seeing 
a zoomed-out version in the overview window at 
the top.

46 
Lesson 3 
Basic editing
Opening a file for editing
You can open multiple files in Adobe Audition, which are stacked behind each 
other in the main Waveform view. Individual files are selected via the Editor panel 
drop-down menu. 
1 Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson03 folder, select the file Narration01, 
and then click Open.
2 To open multiple files simultaneously, choose File > Open, and navigate to 
the Lesson03 folder. Select Narration02, and then Shift-click on Narration05. 
Four files are selected. (To select noncontiguous files, press Ctrl-click 
[Command-click] on each file you want to load.)
3 Click Open. Audition loads the selected files.
4 Click the Editor panel’s file selector drop-down menu (just above the upper 
left of the waveform) to see a list of the files you loaded. Click on any of these 
files to select it and open it in the Waveform view. Or, click Close to close the 
current file in the stack (that is, the one visible in the Editor panel).
selecting a region for editing 
and changing its level
To begin editing your audio, you need to start by choosing a file and specifying 
which parts of that file you want to edit. This process is called selection. 
1 Click on the Editor panel drop-down submenu to see a list of recent files loaded 
into Audition. Select Finish Soft.wav, and it will load into the Editor panel. 
2 Click the Transport Play button to hear the file play from start to finish.
3 Note how the words “to finish” are softer than the other words. Sometimes 
when recording narration, a drop in volume can occur at the end of phrases. 
You can fix this in Audition CS6.
4 Click at the beginning of the words, and then drag to the end (or click at the 
end and drag to the beginning). You’ve now selected those words for editing, 
as indicated by a white background. You can fine-tune the selection by clicking 
on the region’s right or left border, either in the Waveform view or timeline, and 
dragging. Note that upon selecting a region, a heads-up display with a small 
volume control appears automatically. 

AdoBe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A Book 47
5 Click on the volume control and drag upward to increase the volume level 
to +6dB. To audition this change, click in the timeline above the waveform. 
Click several seconds before the words you just edited so you can hear them 
in context, and then click Play. 
6 If the level is good, you’re done. If not, choose Edit > Undo Amplify, or press 
Ctrl+Z (Command+Z). Or, vary the level and audition the results again, as you 
did in the previous step.
7 When you’re satisfied with the level, click anywhere in the waveform to deselect 
the region but retain the level changes.
cutting, deleting, and pasting audio regions
Cutting, deleting, and pasting audio regions is particularly useful with narration 
audio files because you can remove unwanted sounds from your narration, like 
coughs or “umms,” tighten up spaces, increase spaces between words and phrases, 
and even rearrange the dialogue if needed. In this lesson you’ll edit the following 
narration (file Narration05) so it flows logically and doesn’t have unwanted sounds:
“First, once the files are loaded, select the file you, uh, want to edit from the drop-
down menu. Well actually, you need to go to the File menu first, select open; then 
choose the file you want to edit. Remember; you can (clears throat) open up, uh, 
multiple files at once.”
You’ll get rid of the uhs and throat clearing, and rearrange the narration to say:
“Go to the File menu first; select open; then choose the file you want to edit. 
Remember that you can open up multiple files at once. Once the files are loaded, 
select the file you want to edit from the drop-down menu.”
E Tip: Double-click 
anywhere within a file 
to select the entire file. 
This also returns the 
playhead to the file 
beginning.

48 
Lesson 3 
Basic editing
1 The file Narration05 should still be open. If not, reopen the file from the 
Lessons03 folder. If necessary, select the file Narration05 for editing from the 
Editor panel drop-down submenu. If you’ve closed and reopened Audition, 
choose File > Open Recent and then choose Narration05, or navigate to the 
Lesson03 folder and open Narration05.
2 Play the file until you reach the first “uh.” Stop the transport, and click and drag 
across the “uh” to select it.
3 To hear what the file will sound like after you delete the “uh,” click in the 
timeline several seconds prior to the region, and then click Skip Selection 
(the rightmost transport button). The file will play up to the region start, and 
then seamlessly skip to the region end and resume playback. If you hear a click, 
refer to the sidebar “About zero-crossings.”
4 Choose Edit > Delete to delete the “uh.”
When you invoke this command, you may not see any visual difference when 
zoomed out, because the adjustments are often very minor. However, Audition is 
indeed moving the region boundaries as defined by the command; you can verify 
this by zooming in to the waveform so you can see the results with more accuracy.
5 Now you’ll remove the unwanted throat clearing. If you trim right up to 
the throat-clearing boundaries, when you click the Skip Selection transport 
button you’ll hear a gap. So, select a region that starts somewhat before and 
ends slightly after the actual throat clearing to tighten that gap. Then choose 
Edit > Delete.
P Note: There’s a 
difference between 
Edit > Cut and Edit > 
Delete. Cut removes the 
region but places the 
region in the currently 
selected clipboard 
so it can be pasted 
elsewhere if desired. 
Delete also removes 
the region but does not 
place it in the clipboard, 
and leaves whatever is 
in the clipboard intact.

AdoBe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A Book 49
about zero-crossings
When you define a region and the boundary occurs where the level is anything 
other than zero, this may result in a click upon playback. 
If the boundary occurs on a zero-crossing—a place where the waveform transitions from 
positive to negative, or vice versa—there is no rapid level change; hence, no click.
After making a selection, Audition can automatically optimize the region boundar-
ies so they fall on zero-crossings. Choose Edit > Zero Crossings and select one of 
several options:
• 
Adjust selection inward. Moves the region boundaries closer together so each 
falls on the nearest zero-crossing.
• 
Adjust selection outward. Moves the region boundaries farther apart so each 
falls on the nearest zero-crossing.
• 
Adjust left side to left. Moves the left region boundary to the nearest  
zero-crossing to the left.
• 
Adjust left side to right. Moves the left region boundary to the nearest  
zero-crossing to the right.
• 
Adjust right side to left. Moves the right region boundary to the nearest  
zero-crossing to the left.
• 
Adjust right side to right. Moves the left region boundary to the nearest  
zero-crossing to the right.

50 
Lesson 3 
Basic editing
6 Now let’s remove the second “uh” that’s in the audio. Notice that removing this 
“uh” results in too tight a transition between the words before and after the “uh” 
(you also have to be careful not to cut off too much of the beginning of the word 
“multiple”). So, undo your last cut. Instead of deleting the “uh,” you’ll insert 
silence instead to produce a better result. To do this, select the “uh” and choose 
Edit > Insert > Silence. A dialog box appears denoting the length of the silence, 
which will equal the region length you defined. Click OK.
7 The silent gap between words is too long, so define part of the silence as a 
region. Click Skip Selection to test whether you’ve deleted the right amount. 
Lengthen or shorten the silence as needed, and then choose Edit > Delete. The 
gap is now shorter.
Now that you’ve fixed some of the verbal glitches, let’s change the sentence struc-
ture into a more coherent narration. Keep this file open; if you need to interrupt 
this lesson, choose File > Save As, and save the file as Narration05_edit.
cutting and pasting with multiple clipboards
You’re probably familiar with the computer’s clipboard. In a word processing 
program, you typically copy a sentence to the clipboard and then paste it from the 
clipboard to somewhere else in the text. Audition’s clipboard works similarly but 
offers five clipboards so you can temporarily store up to five different pieces of 
audio for later pasting. You’ll put that feature to good use when further fixing the 
Narration05 file beyond just removing the “uhs” and throat clearing.
1 Select the part of the file that says, “Once the files are loaded, select the file you 
want to edit from the drop-down menu.”
2 Choose Edit > Set Current Clipboard and select Clipboard 1. You can also select 
this clipboard by pressing Ctrl+1 (Command+1).

AdoBe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A Book 51
3 To remove the phrase and store it in Clipboard 1, choose Edit > Cut or press 
Ctrl+X (Command+X) to place the phrase in Clipboard 1. The word (Empty) 
will no longer appear next to the Clipboard 1 name.
4 Select the part of the file that says, “Go to the file menu first; select open; then 
choose the file you want to edit.”
5 Press Ctrl+2 (Command+2) to make Clipboard 2 the current clipboard (you 
could also choose Edit > Set Current Clipboard and select Clipboard 2).
6 Choose Edit > Cut to place the phrase in Clipboard 2.
7 Select the part of the file that says, “Remember; you can open up multiple files 
at once.”
8 Press Ctrl+3 (Command+3) to make Clipboard 3 the current clipboard.
9 Choose Edit > Cut to place the phrase in Clipboard 3. Keep the Narration05 
file open.
Now you have a separate clip for each phrase, which will make it easy to place the 
phrases in a different order. The goal is to end up with “Go to the file menu first; 
select open; then choose the file you want to edit. Remember; you can open up 
multiple files at once. Once the files are loaded, select the file you want to edit from 
the drop-down menu.”
1 Select all the leftover bits of audio in the Narration05 file (or simply press 
Ctrl+A [Command+A]) and press the Delete key. This clears all the audio and 
places the playhead at the file’s beginning.
2 Clipboard 2 contains the introduction you want. Press Ctrl+2 (Command+2) 
to select that clipboard, and then choose Edit > Paste or press Ctrl+V 
(Command+V).
3 Play the file to confirm you have the desired audio. The playhead will stop at 
the file’s end if Skip Selection is disabled or return to the file beginning if Skip 
Selection is enabled.
4 Click within the Waveform view to deselect the pasted audio. Otherwise, 
subsequent pasting will replace the selected region.
5 Click where you want to insert the next phrase. For this lesson, you’ll place it at 
the end of the audio file.
6 Clipboard 3 has the desired middle section for this project. Press Ctrl+3 
(Command+3), and then press Ctrl+V (Command+V).
7 Repeat steps 4 and 5.
8 Clipboard 1 has the desired ending for this project. Press Ctrl+1 (Command+1), 
and then press Ctrl+V (Command+V).

52 
Lesson 3 
Basic editing
Play the file to hear the rearranged audio. For further practice, you can:
• Tighten up spaces between words by selecting a region and pressing Ctrl+X 
(Command+X) or Delete, or choosing Edit > Cut.
• Add more space between words by placing the playhead where you want to 
insert silence (don’t drag, just click), and then choose Edit > Insert > Silence. 
When a dialog box appears, enter the desired duration of silence in the format 
minutes:seconds.hundredths of a second.
Extending and shortening musical selections
Background music often needs to be lengthened or shortened to fit a video’s 
duration. In this lesson you’ll lengthen a piece of music by copying one verse and 
extending it to create two verses.
1 Navigate to the Lesson03 folder, and open the file Ueberschall_PopCharts.wav.  
(“Pop Charts” is the name of a commercially available sound library from 
Ueberschall you can use to create your own royalty-free sound tracks and 
needledrop music.)
2 Start playback. The verse starts at about 7.5 seconds and ends around 23.2 
seconds, where it changes key and goes into a bridge.
3 You need to define the precise verse beginning and end, copy that, and then 
insert it at the end of the first verse. Place the playhead at the approximate 
beginning of the verse (around 7.5 seconds).
4 Zoom in until you can see an obvious pulse at 7.74 seconds; this corresponds to 
the downbeat where the kick drum is prominent. Click at the beginning of the 
downbeat, and then press M to place a marker there.
5 Zoom out and locate the end of the verse (around 23.2 seconds).
6 Again, zoom in and place a marker at the beat that happens just after 23.2 seconds.
7 Zoom out until you can see both markers. Choose Edit > Snapping; select 
Enabled and verify that Snap to Markers is currently enabled. 

AdoBe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A Book 53
8 Select the region between the two markers. Note that because you enabled 
snapping, the markers have a virtual “magnetic field” that “snaps” the region 
boundaries to the markers when those boundaries are within a certain distance 
of the markers. 
9 Press Ctrl+C (Command+C) or choose Edit > Copy to copy the selected region 
to the current clipboard.
10 Click within the waveform to deselect the current region, and then click on 
the second marker. If you click right on the marker, the playhead will snap to it 
because snapping is enabled. Another option is to click somewhat before the 
second marker, and then click the transport’s Move Playhead to Next button (or 
press Ctrl+right arrow [Command+right arrow]) to move the playhead directly 
on top of the marker. 
11 Press Ctrl+V (Command+V) or choose Edit > Paste. The pasted verse now 
follows the first verse before going into the bridge. Play the file from the 
beginning to verify this.
You can use a similar concept to shorten music. Suppose you want to change the 
intro’s length to half its current length. Note that the intro repeats twice, from 0 
seconds to 3.872 seconds and from 3.872 seconds up to the first marker. Here’s how 
to shorten the intro.
1 Place a marker halfway through the intro (this happens at 3.872 seconds). 
Remember that the marker needs to go at the precise beginning of the beat. 
2 Zoom out and select the region between this new marker and the marker that 
indicates the start of the first verse.
3 Press Ctrl+X (Command+X) or press the Delete key.
4 Play the file to verify that the beginning is now half the original length.
Keep the edited Ueberschall_PopCharts.wav file open and continue. If you need to 
interrupt this lesson, choose File > Save As and save the file as Ueberschall_edit.
simultaneous mixing and pasting
Let’s add a cymbal to the place where the pasted, second verse begins. 
1 With the edited Ueberschall_PopCharts.wav file still open, choose File > Open, 
navigate to the Lesson03 folder, and open the file Cymbal.wav.
2 Press Ctrl+A (Command+A) to select the entire cymbal sound.
3 Press Ctrl+C (Command+C) to copy the cymbal sound to the current clipboard.
4 From the Editor panel’s file selector drop-down menu, choose the Ueberschall_
PopCharts.wav file.

54 
Lesson 3 
Basic editing
5 Click on Marker 01 at 3.5 seconds, which indicates the start of the second verse 
(the one you pasted in previously).
6 Choose Edit > Mix Paste. A dialog box appears where you can adjust the levels 
of the copied audio and existing audio.
7 Because you probably don’t want an overbearing cymbal sound, set the Copied 
Audio volume to about 70%, and then click OK.
8 Play the file to hear the cymbal mixed with the original audio to introduce the 
second verse. Save this file, and then close it before proceeding.
Repeating part of a waveform to create a loop
Many elements in music are repetitive. A loop is a piece of music that lends itself to 
repetition, like a drum pattern; many companies offer sound libraries of loops that are 
suitable for creating sound tracks (Lesson 12, “Creating Music with Sound Libraries,” 
covers how to create sound tracks in Audition by using loops). However, it’s also pos-
sible to create your own loops by extracting a loop from a longer piece of audio.
1 Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson03 folder, and open the file 
Ueberschall_PopCharts.wav.
2 Click the Transport’s Loop Playback button, or press Ctrl+L (Command+L). 
3 Try to select a region that makes musical sense when looped. You can move the 
region boundaries during playback. If you have a hard time finding good loop 
points, set a region to start at 7.742 seconds and end at 9.673. You’ll need to 
zoom in to set these timings accurately.
4 Once you’ve located and selected a suitable loop, choose Edit > Copy to New 
or press Shift+Alt+C (Shift+Option+C) to copy your loop to a new file that 
appears in the Editor panel. 
P Note: The reason 
for adjusting the mix of 
the pasted and existing 
audio is to avoid 
distortion. If you try to 
mix two audio files that 
are already at 100% 
or maximum volume, 
you would need to 
reduce each one by 
50% to avoid distortion, 
because the mixed 
levels would exceed 
the maximum available 
headroom.

AdoBe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A Book 55
You can select between this loop and the original file from which it came using 
the Editor panel’s file selector drop-down menu.
5 With the loop displayed in the Editor panel, choose Edit > Save As or press 
Shift+Ctrl+S (Shift+Command+S) and navigate to where you want to save the 
loop. Now you have a loop you can use in other pieces of music.
E Tip: There are several others ways to save an individual selection. Choose File > Save Selection As 
to save the selection immediately to disk without having it appear as a file within Audition’s Editor 
panel or be accessible in the Editor panel’s file selector drop-down menu. However, note that it’s 
saved to the current clipboard. You can also cut or copy a selection (which of course is saved to the 
current clipboard), and then choose Edit > Paste to New. This creates a new file that’s accessible in 
the Editor panel’s file selector drop-down menu. 
Fading regions to reduce artifacts
Audio may have unintended noises, such as hum or hiss, that are masked when 
audio like narration is playing but are audible when the narration stops. Other 
unintended noises can also occur, like “p-pops” (a “popping” sound that happens 
from the sudden burst of air associated with plosive sounds like “b” or “p”), clicks, 
mouth noises, and so on. Audition has advanced techniques for removing noise 
and doing audio restoration, but for simple problems, a fade is often all you need.
1 Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson03 folder, and open the file PPop.wav.
2 Zoom in and move the playhead to the start of the file. The keyboard shortcut 
to do this is Ctrl+left arrow (Command+left arrow). Note the spike at the 
beginning that corresponds to the “pop.”
3 Click the small, square Fade In button in the upper-left corner and drag to the 
right. You can see the fade attenuating the spike. Dragging the Fade In button 
up or down alters the fade’s shape (up for convex, down for concave). A concave 
fade is an ideal choice here, because it gets rid of the most objectionable part of 
the pop but still leaves in the “p” sound.

56 
Lesson 3 
Basic editing
4 There’s also another, less objectionable pop at 0.20 seconds. Although you could 
cut this file to the clipboard, create a new file, add a fade-in, and paste it back 
into place, an easier solution is simply to select the pop sound as a region and 
use the HUD’s volume control to drop the level by 8 or 9dB.
5 Suppose you want to shorten the file to end with “...that can happen” instead of 
“that can happen when recording.” Zoom in and go to the end of the file. Locate 
the part that says “when recording,” select it as a region, and then press the 
Delete key.
6 However, now “happen” doesn’t end elegantly; there’s an audible artifact at the 
end. You’ll use the Fade Out button to reduce this.
7 Click the Fade Out button and drag left to 2.8 seconds. Then drag down to 
about -30 and release the mouse button to make the fade “stick.”
8 Play the file to hear that the artifact at the end is gone.
E Tip: If a file doesn’t 
begin or end on a zero-
crossing and you hear 
a click, adding a very 
slight fade time will 
reduce or eliminate the 
click. Use a convex fade 
for this application.

Review questions
1 What is the easiest way to change level for a selection?
2 Why is it important to have selection boundaries on zero-crossing?
3 How many clipboards does Audition offer?
4 What’s the most effective way to eliminate a “p-pop”?
Review answers
1 As soon as you make a selection, a heads-up display opens with a volume control that 
lets you change level.
2 Cutting and pasting with selections bounded by zero-crossings tend to minimize clicks.
3 Audition has five individual clipboards that can hold five independent pieces of audio.
4 Placing a fade-in on top of a p-pop lets you determine how much of the pop to 
minimize and how much to minimize it.

Signal ProceSSing 
lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Use the Effects Rack to create chains of effects
• Apply effects to audio
• Adjust parameters in various effects to process audio in specific ways
• Alter dynamics, frequency response, ambience, and many other 
audio attributes
• Simulate guitar amp and effects setups with Guitar Suite effects 
• Load third-party plug-in effects with Mac or Windows computers
• Apply single effects rapidly without the Effects Rack by using the 
Effects menu
• Create favorite presets you can apply immediately to audio simply 
by selecting them
This lesson can take several hours to complete, depending on how deeply 
you want to explore the various processors. Copy the Lesson04 folder 
that contains the audio examples into the Lessons folder that you created 
on your hard drive for these projects. Remember that you needn’t be 
concerned about modifying these files, because you can always return 
to the original versions by copying them from the Adobe Audition CS6 
Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.
4  

59
Use signal processors to “sweeten” the audio in 
multiple ways: fix tonal balance, alter dynamics, add 
ambience or special effects, and much more. Draw 
from the extensive collection of effects included in 
Audition, or use third-party plug-in processors.

60 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
effects basics
Effects, also called signal processors, can “sweeten” audio as well as fix problems 
(such as too much treble or bass). They are the audio equivalent of video effects, 
like contrast, sharpen, color balance, light rays, pixelate, and so on. In fact, 
sometimes audio engineers even use similar terms, like “brightness,” to describe 
increased treble.
Adobe Audition includes a wide range of effects. Most can work with the 
Waveform and Multitrack Editors, but some are available only in the Waveform 
Editor. There are three main ways of working with effects, which are available in 
the Waveform and Multitrack Editors.
• The Effects Rack allows you to create a chain of up to 16 effects, which you can 
enable or disable independently. You can add, delete, replace, or reorder effects. 
The Effects Rack is the most flexible way of working with effects.
• The Effects menu allows you to select an individual effect from the Effects 
menu bar and apply it to whatever audio is selected. When you need to apply 
only one specific effect, using this menu is quicker than using the Effects Rack. 
Some effects are available in the Effects menu that are not available in the 
Effects Rack.
• The Favorites menu is the quickest but least flexible way to work with effects. If 
you come up with a particularly useful effects setting, you can save it as a Favorite 
preset. The preset is then added to the list of Favorites you can access with the 
Favorites menu. Selecting it applies that preset instantly to whatever audio is 
selected; you cannot change any parameter values before applying the effect.
This lesson initially covers using the Effects Rack, which introduces the majority 
of effects. The second section covers the Effects menu and discusses the remaining 
effects that are available only via the Effects menu. The final section describes how 
to work with presets, including Favorites.
Using the effects rack
For all lessons involving the Effects Rack, it is best to use the Default workspace. 
From the File menu, choose Window > Workspace > Default. 
1 Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drums110.wav.
2 Click the Transport Loop button so the drum pattern plays back 
continuously. Click the Transport Play button to audition the loop, and 
then click the Transport Stop button.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 61
3 Click the Effects Rack tab, and drag the panel’s lower splitter bar downward to 
extend the panel to its full height. You should see 16 “slots,” called inserts; each 
of which can hold an individual effect and also includes a power on/off button. 
A toolbar is located above the inserts, and meters with a second toolbar are 
below the inserts.
4 Before exploring individual effects, look at the individual effect’s inserts. Although 
you can’t see any graphical connection among them, the effect’s inserts are in 
series, meaning that the audio file feeds the first effect input, the first effect output 
feeds the second effect input, the second effect output feeds the third effect input, 
and so on until the last effect output goes to your audio interface.
5 To add an effect to an insert, click the insert’s right arrow and choose an effect from 
the drop-down menu. For the first effect, choose Reverb > Studio Reverb. Inserting 
an effect turns its power button to “on” (green) and opens the effect’s graphic user 
interface. You may need to move the effect’s graphic user interface to load more 
effects. For the second effect, similarly choose Delay and Echo > Analog Delay.
P Note: Effects do 
not have to go into 
consecutive inserts. You 
can leave empty inserts 
between effects and 
place effects in these 
inserts later.

Lesson 4 
signal Processing
6 Turn off (bypass) the Analog Delay effect by clicking its power button. Press 
the spacebar to begin playback, and then turn the Studio Reverb insert’s power 
button on and off to hear how reverb affects the sound.
7 Click the Rack Effect – Studio Reverb graphic user interface window to bring it 
to the front. Press the spacebar again to stop playback.
8 When playback is stopped, you can choose an effect’s preset. Click the Studio 
Reverb’s Presets drop-down menu, and select Drum Plate (Large). Begin playback.
You’ll hear a more pronounced reverb sound. Note that the effects window has 
an additional power button in the lower-left corner to make it easy to bypass/
compare the processed and unprocessed sound.
9 Click on the Analog Delay effect graphic user interface to bring it to the front, 
and then turn on its power button. 
You’ll hear an echo effect, but it’s not in time with the music.
10 To make the delay follow the rhythm, double-click in the Delay parameter’s 
numeric field, type 545 in place of 200, and then press Enter. The echoes are 
now in time with the music. (Later in this lesson we’ll explain how to choose 
rhythmically correct delay times.)
Keep this lesson open as you continue. 
removing, editing, replacing, and moving an effect
Rather than present a structured exercise, try the various bulleted options that fol-
low to see how they work. After each action, choose Edit > Undo [name of action] 
or type Ctrl+Z (Command+Z) to restore the project to its previous state: 
• To remove a single effect, click the effect’s insert and press the Delete key, or
click the insert’s right arrow to select Remove Effect from the drop-down menu.
• To remove all effects in the rack, right-click (Control-click) anywhere on an 
effect’s insert, and then choose Remove All Effects. 
• To remove some effects in the rack, Ctrl-click (Command-click) in each effect 
insert containing an effect you want to remove. Then right-click (Control-click) 
anywhere in any selected effect’s insert, and choose Remove Selected Effects. 
• To edit an effect when the effects window is hidden or you closed it, either 
double-click the effect’s insert and click the insert’s right arrow to select Edit 
Effect from the drop-down menu, or right-click (Control-click) anywhere in an 
effect’s insert and choose Edit Selected Effect. Either of these actions brings the 
effects window to the front and opens it if it was closed.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 63
• To replace an effect with a different effect, click the insert’s right arrow and 
select a different effect from the drop-down menu.
• To move an effect to a different insert, click the effect’s insert and drag to the 
desired destination insert. If an effect already exists in that insert, the existing 
effect will be pushed down to the next higher-numbered insert.
Bypassing all or some effects
You can bypass individual effects, groups of effects, or all effects in the Effects Rack 
by doing the following:
• The power button in the lower-left corner of the Effects Rack’s panel bypasses 
all rack effects that are on. When powered back on, only effects that had been 
on prior to bypassing return to being on. Bypassed effects remain bypassed 
regardless of the “all effects” power button setting.
• Right-click (Control-click) on any effect’s insert and choose Toggle Power State 
of Effects Rack.
• To bypass some effects, Ctrl-click (Command-click) on each effect’s insert you 
want to bypass, right-click (Control-click) on any of these inserts, and then 
choose Toggle Power State of Selected Effects.
“gain-staging” effects 
Sometimes inserting multiple effects in series causes certain frequencies to “add 
up” and produce levels that may exceed the available headroom. For example, a fil-
ter that emphasizes the midrange could create distortion by increasing levels above 
acceptable limits. 
To set levels, in the lower part of the Effects panel use the Input and Output level con-
trols (with associated meters). These controls can reduce or increase levels as needed.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving so you can start fresh. Open the 
program, choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drums110.wav. Do not start playback yet.
2 In any effect’s insert, click the right arrow, choose Filter and EQ > Parametric 
Equalizer from the drop-down menu.
3 When the Parametric EQ window opens, click on the small box labeled 3 and 
drag it to the graph’s top. Close the Parametric EQ window.

64 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
4  Caution: Turn your monitoring levels way down, and then press the spacebar 
to initiate playback. The excessive levels will trigger the output meter’s red 
overload indicators to the meter’s right.
5 The Input and Output level controls default to +0dB gain, which means neither 
the signal coming into the Effects Rack, nor the signal leaving it, is amplified or 
attenuated. However, the massive EQ boost is overloading the output. Turn up 
the monitoring level enough so you can hear the distortion this causes.
6 It’s generally good practice to keep the Output control at +0dB and compensate 
for the excessive levels by trimming the Input level. Reduce the Input level until 
the peaks no longer trigger the red distortion indicators. This will likely require 
reducing the Input to -35dB or so. 
Keep this project open for the next lesson. 
altering the effect’s wet/dry mix
An unprocessed signal is called dry, whereas one to which effects have been applied 
is called wet. Sometimes you want a blend of the wet and dry sounds rather than all 
of one or the other.
1 With the previous project still open and the levels set properly to avoid 
distortion, click on the Mix slider below the meters and drag left.
2 Drag the slider to the right to increase the amount of wet, filtered sound, and 
drag to the left to increase the amount of dry, unprocessed sound. 
applying effects
Inserting an effect doesn’t change the file but instead plays the original file back 
through the effect. This is called a nondestructive process using a real-time effect, 
because the original file remains unaltered.
However, you may want to apply the effect to the entire file, or only a selection, so 
that saving the file saves the processed version.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving so you can start fresh. Open the 
program, choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drums110.wav.
E Tip: You can click 
anywhere in the Output 
meter to reset the red 
distortion indicators. 
To reset the Input or 
Output knob to +0dB, 
Alt-click (Option-click) 
on the knob. You can 
also toggle the Meters/
Controls view with the 
button to the right of 
the panel’s master on/off 
switch in the lower left.
E Tip: Using the Mix 
slider to blend in more 
dry sound provides an 
easy way to make an 
effect more subtle.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 65
2 In any effect’s insert, click the right arrow and choose Reverb > Studio Reverb.
3 When the Studio Reverb window appears, choose the preset Drum Plate (Small) 
from the presets drop-down menu.
4 The Process drop-down menu, located in the toolbar at the bottom of the 
Effects Rack panel, allows you to apply the effect to the entire file or just a 
selection. For this lesson, choose Entire File.
5 Click the Apply button. This not only applies the effect to the file to process it, 
but deletes the effect from the Effects Rack so the file isn’t “double processed” 
from the effect being embedded in the file and from a processor remaining 
in the rack.
6 Close the project without saving by choosing File > Close All.
Let’s move on to lessons that show how individual effects change the sound.
amplitude and compression effects
Amplitude and Compression effects change levels or alter dynamics. You’ll load 
each effect individually to hear how each one changes the sound.
amplify
Amplify can make a file louder or softer. When increasing amplitude to make a 
file louder, choose a low enough amount of amplification so that the file remains 
undistorted.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving so you can start fresh. Open the 
program, choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drums+Bass+Arp110.wav.
2 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and then choose Amplitude 
and Compression > Amplify.
P Note: You can 
insert additional effects 
into the Effects Rack 
to change the sound 
further, and then apply 
those effects. The file 
will then reflect the 
changes caused by 
all the effects you’ve 
applied. Also note that 
any changes are still not 
permanent until you 
save (using either Save 
or Save As) the file. At 
that point, the effects 
will be embedded 
permanently in the file. 

66 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
3 Enable looping on the Transport, and then start playback.
Amplify has only one parameter, Gain, which varies from -96dB (maximum 
attenuation) to +48dB (maximum amplification). With Link Sliders selected, 
adjusting gain for one channel changes gain equally in the other channel. 
Deselecting Link Sliders allows for adjusting each channel individually.
4 With Link Sliders selected, click the Gain slider and drag left (attenuation) or 
right (amplification). You can also drag up/down or left/right in the numerical 
field to change gain in integer increments, or double-click on the numerical field 
and type in a specific number.
5 Using the numerical field, increase the gain to +2dB, and observe the Output 
meters. They do not go into the red so it is safe to increase the gain by this 
amount. Now increase the gain to +3dB. The Output meter goes into the red, 
which shows that the gain is too high and is overloading the output. Also, try 
decreasing the level and listen to the results.
6 Stop playback, click on the effect’s insert with Amplify applied, and press the 
Delete key. Keep Audition open.
channel Mixer
The Channel Mixer alters the amount of left and right channel signal present in the 
left and right channels. Consider two possible applications: converting stereo to 
mono and reversing the left and right channels.
1 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and then choose Amplitude 
and Compression > Channel Mixer.
2 With looping enabled on the Transport, begin playback.
3 Click the Channel Mixer’s L (left) tab. It’s currently set so that the left channel 
consists entirely of signal from the left channel. You’ll convert this stereo signal 
into a monaural signal by having equal amounts of left and right channel signals 
in the left and right channels.
4 With the L tab still selected, move both the L and R sliders to 50.
5 Bypass the Channel Mixer using either the Effects Rack’s power on/off button 
or the one in the Channel Mixer panel’s lower left. When bypassed, the stereo 
image is wider.
6 Enable the Channel Mixer by making sure the power button is on, and let’s 
complete converting the signal to mono.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 67
7 Click the R tab and adjust the L and R sliders to 50. Now the signal is monaural. 
Bypass and enable the Channel Mixer to verify.
8 The Channel Mixer also makes it easy to swap channels. Click the L tab and set 
the L slider to 0 and the R slider to 100. Now the left channel consists entirely of 
signal from the right channel.
9 Click the R tab. Set the L slider to 100 and the R slider to 0. Now the right 
channel consists entirely of signal from the left channel.
10 Bypass and enable the Channel Mixer; doing so reverses the two channels. 
When bypassed, the hi-hat is in the left channel. When enabled, it’s in the 
right channel.
11 Stop playback, click the effect’s insert that contains the Channel Mixer, and then 
press the Delete key. Keep Audition open.
Deesser
Audition’s DeEsser reduces vocal sibilants (“ess” sounds). De-essing is a three-step 
process: Identify the frequencies where sibilants exist, define that range, and then 
set a threshold, which if exceeded by a sibilant, automatically reduces the gain 
within the specified range. This makes the sibilant less prominent.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving so you can start fresh. Choose File > 
Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file DeEsser.wav.
2 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and then choose Amplitude 
and Compression > DeEsser.
3 Enable looping on the Transport, and then start playback.
4 As the file plays, you’ll see a display of the frequency spectrum. Sibilants are 
high frequencies. Look carefully at the spectrum and confirm that you see peaks 
in the range around 10000Hz.
5 To make it easier to find the sibilants, set the Threshold to -40dB and Bandwidth 
to 7500Hz.
P Note: Converting 
stereo to mono is a 
common enough 
operation that the 
Channel Mixer preset 
named All Channels 
50% performs this 
conversion.

68 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
6 Vary the Center Frequency. When set to maximum (12000Hz), you can still 
hear quite a bit of sibilance because this is higher than the sibilants’ frequency. 
Similarly, when set to minimum (500Hz), the sibilants are above this range 
and are still audible. You’ll find a “sweet spot” between 9000 and 10000Hz that 
reduces sibilants.
7 To fine-tune this further, select Output Sibilance Only. Now you’ll hear only the 
sibilants. Adjust the Center Frequency to hear the greatest amount of sibilants 
and the least amount of the voice, which will be around 10400Hz. The Gain 
Reduction meter shows the sibilant range’s attenuation.
8 Deselect Output Sibilance Only, and bypass/enable the DeEsser to hear the 
difference.
9 Stop playback, click the effect’s insert that includes the DeEsser, and press the 
Delete key.
10 Choose File > Close and don’t save the file. Keep Audition open.
Dynamics processing
With a standard amplifier, the relationship between the input and output is linear. 
In other words, if there’s a gain of 1, the output signal will be the same as the input 
signal. If there’s a gain of 2, the output signal will have twice the level of the input 
signal, whatever the input signal level may be.
A Dynamics Processor changes the relationship of the output to the input. This 
change is called compression when a large input signal increase produces only a 
small output signal increase and expansion when a small input signal increase 
produces a large output signal increase. Both can be present at the same time by 
expanding signals within one range of levels and compressing signals in a different 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 69
range of levels. The Dynamics Processor’s graph shows the input signal on the hori-
zontal axis and the output on the vertical axis.
Compression can make a sound subjectively louder and is the tool that makes TV 
commercials SO MUCH LOUDER THAN EVERYTHING ELSE. Expansion is less 
common; one application is to expand objectionable low-level signals (like hiss) to 
reduce their levels further. There are also many uses for both as special effects. 
In the following graph, as the input signal changes from -100dB to -40dB, the 
output changes from -100dB to only -95dB. As a result, the Dynamics Processor 
has compressed 60dB of input dynamic range into 5dB of change at the output. 
But from -40dB to 0dB, the output changes from -95dB to 0dB. Therefore, the 
Dynamics Processor has expanded 40dB of input dynamic range into 95dB of out-
put dynamic range.
In the graph these ranges are given a segment number, and the area below the 
graph provides information about each segment:
• The segment number
• The relationship between output and input expressed as a ratio
• Whether the segment is an Expander or Compressor
• The Threshold (range of levels) where the expansion or compression takes effect
The easiest way to become familiar with dynamics processing is to call up presets, 
listen to how they affect the sound, and correlate what you hear to what you see on 
the graph.
1 Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drums+Bass+Arp110.wav.

70 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
2 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and then choose Amplitude 
and Compression > Dynamics Processing.
3 Enable looping on the Transport, and then start playback.
4 Select various presets. Note that you will need to turn down the Effects Rack’s 
Output level with some of the more “aggressive” presets to avoid distortion.
5 Create your own dynamics processing. Choose the (Default) preset, which 
provides neither compression nor expansion.
6 Click on the little white square in the upper right and drag it down slowly to 
around -10dB. You’ll hear how this brings down peaks and makes the sound 
less dynamic.
7 Create a less abrupt change. Click in the middle of segment 1 (e.g., where 
the segment crosses -15dB) to create another square. Drag it up a little bit to 
around -12dB.
8 Now you’ll use expansion to reduce low-level sounds. Click on the line at -30dB 
and -40dB to create two more squares. Click on the one at -40dB, and drag it 
down all the way to -100dB. This effect makes the drums sound more percussive.
9 Look at the Effects Rack’s Output meter. Bypass the dynamics processing, and 
you’ll note that the signal is actually a little louder because compression has 
reduced the peaks. To compensate for this, click in the Dynamics Processor’s 
Make-Up Gain parameter located just below the curve’s horizontal axis. 
Increase the gain by +4dB.
10 Bypass and enable the Dynamics Processor. By adding Make-Up gain, the 
processed signal is now a little bit louder.
11 Stop playback, click the effect’s insert with the Dynamics Processor, and press 
the Delete key. Don’t close the file, and leave Audition open.
P Note: Audition’s 
Dynamics Processor is 
extremely sophisticated. 
Although you’ve 
just experienced the 
basic concepts in the 
dynamics processing 
exercise, the Settings 
page allows for 
further customization 
and effects. Basic 
compression and 
expansion can solve 
most audio problems 
that need dynamics 
control, but please 
refer to the Audition 
documentation for 
detailed information 
on other Dynamics 
Processor parameters.

Hard limiter
Like an engine’s governor that limits the maximum number of RPMs, a limiter
restricts an audio signal’s maximum output level. For example, if you don’t want an 
audio file to exceed a level of -10dB, yet there are some peaks that reach -2dB, set 
the limiter’s Maximum Amplitude for -10dB and it will “absorb” the peaks so they 
don’t exceed -10dB. This is different from simple attenuation (which lowers the 
levels of all signals), because in this example of limiting, levels below -10dB remain 
untouched. Levels above -10dB are compressed with an essentially infinite ratio, so 
any input level increase produces no output level increase above -10dB.
This limiter also has an Input Boost parameter, which can make a signal subjec-
tively louder. Here’s why: If you set the Maximum Amplitude to 0, you can increase 
the level of an input signal that already reaches the maximum headroom because 
the limiter will prevent it from distorting by “clamping” its output to 0. Let’s listen 
to how this affects a mix.
1 With the Drums+Bass+Arp110.wav still loaded, click an Effects Rack insert’s 
right arrow button, and choose Amplitude and Compression > Hard Limiter.
2 Enable looping on the Transport, and then start playback.
3 Look at the Maximum Amplitude numeric field to confirm that the default 
value is -0.1. This level ensures that the signal won’t hit zero, so the output won’t 
trigger the red zone in the Effects Rack panel’s Output level meters. 
4 Raise the Input Boost amount above 0 while observing the Output level meters. 
Note that even if you add lots of boost, like 10dB, the output still doesn’t go 
above -0.1, and the Output meters never go into the red.
5 The Release Time sets how long it takes for the limiter to stop limiting after a 
signal no longer exceeds the maximum amplitude. In most cases the default is 
fine. With a fair amount of input boost, shorter Release settings—even though 
they limit the signal more accurately—produce a “choppy” effect. With the 
Input Boost set to around +16dB, move the Release Time slider all the way to 
the right to hear this “choppiness.” When using the Release Time slider, the rule 
of thumb is to set it for the most natural sound.
6 The Look-Ahead Time allows the limiter to react to fast transients. With no 
look-ahead time, the limiter has to react instantly to a transient, which is not 
possible: It has to know a transient exists before it can decide what to do with it. 
Look-Ahead alerts the limiter when a transient is coming, so the reaction can be 
instantaneous. Longer settings cause a slight delay through the effect, although 
in most cases this doesn’t matter. The default setting is fine, but experiment with 
increasing the Look-Ahead Time slider if the transients sound “mushy.”
P Note: There’s a point 
of diminishing returns 
with hard limiting. Past a 
certain amount of input 
boost, the sound will 
become unnatural. The 
level at which this will 
occur varies depending 
on the input signal 
source. With voice, 
you can usually get 
away with more boost 
than with a full mix of 
something like a band.

72 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
Single-Band compressor
The Single-Band Compressor is a “classic” compressor for dynamic range compres-
sion and is an excellent choice for learning about how compression works.
As explained in the “Dynamics processing” section, compression changes the rela-
tionship of the output signal to the input signal. The two most important parameters 
are Threshold (the level above which compression starts to occur) and Ratio, which 
sets the amount of change in the output signal for a given input signal change. For 
example, with a 4:1 ratio, a 4dB increase in input level produces a 1dB increase at the 
output. With an 8:1 ratio, an 8dB increase in input level produces a 1dB increase at 
the output. In this lesson you’ll hear how compression affects the sound.
1 If the Drums+Bass+Arp110.wav is not open, close any currently open files and 
open it. Also, delete any currently loaded effects.
2 Click the Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and choose Amplitude and 
Compression > Single-Band Compressor.
3 Enable looping on the Transport, and then start playback.
4 Assuming the Default preset is loaded, move the Threshold slider over its full 
range. You won’t hear any difference because the Ratio defaults to 1:1, so there’s 
a linear relationship between the output and input.
5 With Threshold at 0, move the Ratio slider over its full range. Again you won’t 
hear any difference, because all audio will lie below the Threshold—so there’s 
nothing above the Threshold that can be affected by the Ratio slider. This 
shows how the Threshold and Ratio controls interrelate, and explains why you 
usually need to go back and forth between these two controls to dial in the right 
amount of compression.
6 Set the Threshold slider to -20dB and the Ratio slider to 1. Slowly increase the 
Ratio slider by moving it to the right. The farther you move it to the right, the 
more compressed the sound. Leave the Ratio slider at 10 (i.e., 10:1).
7 Experiment with the Threshold slider. The lower the Threshold, the more 
compressed the sound; below about -20dB, with a Ratio of 10:1, the sound 
becomes so compressed as to be unusable. Leave the Threshold slider at 
-10dB for now.
8 Look at the Effects Rack panel’s Output meter. When you bypass the Single-
Band Compressor, note that the meters are more animated and have more 
pronounced peaks. Enable the Single-Band Compressor; the signal’s peaks are 
less dynamic and more uniform.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 73
9 Note the maximum peak level in bypassed mode. Then with the Single-Band 
Compressor enabled, adjust its Output Gain control to around 2.5-3.0dB, so 
its peaks match the same level as when bypassed. Now when you compare 
the bypassed and enabled states, you’ll hear that despite having the same peak 
levels, the compressed version sounds louder. The reason is that reducing peaks 
allows for increasing the overall output gain without exceeding the available 
headroom or causing distortion.
10 It’s possible to make this difference even more pronounced. Attack sets a delay 
before the compression occurs after a signal exceeds the threshold. Allowing 
a slight Attack time, like the default setting of 10ms, lets through percussive 
transients up to 10ms in duration before the compression kicks in. This retains 
some of a signal’s natural percussiveness. Now set the Attack time to 0.
11 Again, observe the Output level meters. With 0 Attack time, the peaks have 
been reduced even further, which means the Single-Band Compressor Output 
Gain can go even higher; set it to 6dB, and when you enable/bypass the Single-
Band Compressor, the peak levels are the same—yet the compressed version 
sounds a lot “bigger.”
12 Release determines how long it takes for the compression to stop compressing 
once the signal falls below the threshold. There are no rules about Release time; 
basically, set it subjectively for the smoothest, most natural sound, which will 
usually lie between 200 and 1000ms. 
13 Keep Audition open and loaded with the same file.
Tube-Modeled compressor 
The Tube-Modeled Compressor has the same control complement as the Single-
Band Compressor but offers a slightly different, somewhat less “crisp” sonic 
character. You can use the same basic steps as in the previous lesson to explore the 
Tube-Modeled Compressor. The one obvious difference is that the Tube-Modeled 
Compressor has two meters: the one on the left shows the input signal level, and 
the one on the right shows how much the gain is being reduced to provide the 
specified amount of compression. 
Multiband compressor 
The Multiband Compressor is another variation on the “classic” Single-Band 
Compressor. It divides the frequency spectrum into four bands, each with its 
own compressor. Therefore, it’s possible to compress some frequencies more than 
others, such as adding lots of compression to bass but only a moderate amount of 
compression in the upper midrange.

74 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
Dividing the signal into four bands also embodies elements of equalization 
(described later), because you can alter a signal’s frequency response.
If you think adjusting a Single-Band Compressor is complex, a Multiband 
Compressor with four bands isn’t just four times as complex—all these stages also 
interact with each other. Rather than describe how to create a multiband compres-
sion setting from scratch, you’ll load various presets and analyze why they sound 
the way they do. Note that each band has an S (Solo) button, so you can hear what 
that band alone is doing.
1 If the Drums+Bass+Arp110.wav is not open, close any currently open files and 
open it. Also, delete any currently loaded effects.
2 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and choose Amplitude and 
Compression > Multiband Compressor.
3 Enable looping on the Transport, and then start playback.
4 The Default preset doesn’t apply any multiband compression, so listen to that 
first as a point of reference.
5 Load the Broadcast preset, which gives a major boost to the sound. Note that 
the highest and lowest bands have more gain and a higher compression ratio, 
which give a little more “sizzle” and “depth,” respectively.
6 Load the Enhance Highs preset. This shows how multiband compression can 
add an element of equalization; the output gain for the two upper bands is 
considerably higher than the two lower bands. 
7 Load the Enhance Lows preset. This is the mirror image of the Enhance Highs 
preset. The two lower bands’ output gain is higher than the two higher bands. 
8 Load the Hiss Reduction preset, and notice that there’s a lot less highs. The 
reason is that the highest band has an extremely low threshold of -50dB, so even 
low-level, high-frequency sounds are compressed. 
Speech Volume leveler
The Speech Volume Leveler incorporates three processors—leveling, compression, 
and gating—to even out level variations with narration, as well as reduce back-
ground noise with some signals.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving. Open the program, choose File > 
Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file NarrationNeedsHelp.wav.
2 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and choose Amplitude and 
Compression > Speech Volume Leveler.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 75
3 Bypass the effect, and listen to the file all the way through. Note the two quiet 
parts where the narration says, “Most importantly, you need to maintain good 
backups of your data” and “Recovering that data will be a long and expensive 
process.” The rest is at a reasonable volume. You’ll use the Speech Volume 
Leveler to match the levels.
4 Select the audio that says, “Most importantly, you need to maintain good backups 
of your data.” Move the Speech Volume Leveler sliders for Target Volume Level 
and Leveling Amount all the way to the left, and then enable the effect.
5 Click the Transport Loop button, and then click Play.
6 Move the Leveling Amount slider to the right while observing the Input and 
Output meters in the Effects Rack panel. As you move the slider to the right, the 
output will become louder than the input. Choose a value of about 60 for now. 
The output will peak at around -6dB.
7 Select the audio that says, “If all your precious music is stored on a hard drive,” 
loop it and play it. Adjust the Target Volume Level until the peaks match the 
peaks you saw in step 6. The slider should be around -19dB.
8 Double-click on the waveform to select it all, and then listen. There should be 
fewer volume variations between the soft and loud sections.
9 Click the disclosure triangle next to the Advanced options to reveal two more 
settings.
10 To even out levels even further, enable the compressor and move the Threshold 
to the left (more negative numbers) to produce a consistent, natural sound.
11 High Leveling Amount settings can bring up low-level noise, and the Noise 
Gate can compensate for this. To best hear how this works, with the Leveling 
Amount at the default setting of 100, select the audio between 2 and 6 seconds, 
and loop it.
12 Note that the noise becomes very prominent in the space between “data” and 
“if.” Select the Noise Gate, and move the Noise Offset slider all the way to the 
right (25dB). This doesn’t eliminate the noise but reduces it considerably. Move 
the Leveling Amount back to 60, and the noise goes away.
13 Click the power button to bypass and enable the Speech Volume Leveler a few 
times so you can hear how the effect alters the sound. Observe the meters, 
and see if further tweaking can help create a more consistent output. For this 
particular file, a setting with Compressor and Noise Gate off, Target Volume 
Level at -18dB, and a Leveling Amount of 50% seems about optimum.

14 To see how this process affects the file’s waveform, in the lower part of the 
Effects Rack panel, choose Process: Entire File from the drop-down menu, and 
then click Apply. You’ll see that the waveform is much more consistent. In the 
illustration the top waveform is the original file, whereas the lower one has been 
processed by the Speech Volume Leveler. To compare the two, choose Edit > 
Undo Apply Effects Rack, and then choose Edit > Redo Apply Effects Rack.
Delay and echo effects
Adobe Audition has three echo effects with different capabilities. All delay effects 
store audio in memory and then play it back later. The time that elapses between 
storing it and playing it back is the delay time.
Delay
Delay simply repeats the audio, with the repeat’s start time specified by the 
delay amount.
1 If Audition is open, choose File > Close All. Don’t save any changes. Choose 
File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file Arpeggio110.wav.
2 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and then choose Delay and 
Echo > Delay.
3 The Mix slider sets the proportion of dry and delayed audio. Set the Right 
Channel to full Dry and the Left channel to full Wet. This makes it easy to hear 
the difference between the delayed signal in the left channel and the dry signal 
in the right channel.
P Note: The Boost 
Low Signal option raises 
levels for short, low-
volume passages by 
reducing the attack and 
decay time of the effect 
so it changes levels 
more rapidly. You’ll 
usually want this option 
off, but try enabling it to 
determine if there’s an 
improvement.
P Note: Stereo audio 
has separate delays 
for the left and right 
channels, whereas 
mono audio has only a 
single delay.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 77
4 Set the left channel Delay Time slider full right (500ms). You’ll now hear the left 
channel arpeggio delayed by half a second compared to the right channel.
5 Set the left channel Delay Time slider full left (-500ms). You’ll now hear the 
arpeggio start half a second earlier in the left channel than in the right channel.
6 Set both Mix sliders to 50%, and experiment with different delay times. You’ll 
hear a mix of delayed and dry sounds in each channel. Leave Adobe Audition 
open for the next lesson.
analog Delay
Before digital technology, delay used tape or analog delay chip technology. These 
produced a more gritty, colored sound compared to digital delay. Audition’s Analog 
Delay provides a single delay for stereo or mono signals and offers three differ-
ent delay modes: Tape (slight distortion), Tape/Tube (crisper version of tape), 
and Analog (more muffled). Analog Delay simply repeats the audio with the start 
time of the repeat specified by the delay amount. Unlike the Delay effect, there are 
separate controls for Dry and Wet levels instead of a single Mix control. The Delay 
slider provides the same function as the Delay effect except that the maximum 
delay time is 8 seconds. 
1 If Audition is open, choose File > Close All. Don’t save any changes. Choose 
File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file Drums110.wav.
2 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow button, and then choose Delay and 
Echo > Analog Delay.
3 Set Dry Out to 60%, Wet Out to 40%, and Delay to 545ms. Feedback determines 
the number of repeats as they fade out. No Feedback (a setting of 0) produces a 
single echo, values moving toward 100 produce more echoes, and values above 
100 produce “runaway echoes” (watch your monitor volume!). 
4 With feedback at 50, set the Trash control to 100. Change the different modes 
(Tape, Tape/Tube, Analog) to hear how each affects the sound. Vary the 
feedback, being careful to avoid excessive, runaway feedback.
5 Spread at 0% narrows the echoes to mono and at 200% produces a wide stereo 
effect. Play with the various controls, and you’ll hear anything from dance 
mix drum effects to 1950s sci-fi movie sounds. Keep Audition open for the 
next lesson.
echo
Audition’s Echo effect allows for tailoring the echoes’ frequency response by insert-
ing a filter in the delay’s feedback loop, where the output feeds back to the input 
to create additional echoes. As a result, each successive echo processes each echo’s 
timbre to a greater degree. For example, if the response is set to be brighter than 
normal, each echo will be brighter than the previous one.
P Note: You can 
specify delay time 
(lower-left drop-down 
menu) in milliseconds, 
beats, or samples. 
Beats is most useful 
in Multitrack view, 
where the project has 
a particular tempo. 
Samples is useful for 
tuning out short timing 
differences, because 
you can specify delays 
down to 1 sample (at 
a 44,100Hz sample 
rate, that’s a delay of 
22.7 microseconds or 
0.00002267 seconds).
E Tip: With rhythmic 
material, correlating 
delay to the rhythm 
creates a more “musical” 
effect. Use the formula 
60,000/tempo in bpm 
(beats per minute) to 
determine the echo 
for a quarter note. For 
example, the drum 
loop tempo is 110 
bpm, so the echo time 
for a quarter note is 
60,000/110 = 545.45ms. 
An eighth note is half 
that or 272.72ms, a 16th 
note is 136.36ms, and 
so on. The Lesson04 
folder includes a file 
called Period vs. Tempo.
xls. Enter a tempo in this 
spreadsheet to see the 
number of milliseconds 
and samples that 
correspond to particular 
rhythmic values.

Lesson 4 
signal Processing
1 With the Drum110.wav file open, assuming the Analog Delay effect is still 
inserted, click its insert’s right arrow, and then choose Delay and Echo > Echo.
2 Compared to the previous delay effects, Echo has yet another way of setting the 
echo mix; each channel has an Echo Level control that dials in the echo amount. 
The Dry signal is fixed. When using the echo effect, enter the following values 
for the left channel: Delay Time 545ms, Feedback 90%, and Echo Level 70%. 
Enter the following values for the right channel: Delay Time 1090ms, Feedback
70%, and Echo Level 70%.
3 Bring all Successive Echo Equalization controls all the way down (-15dB). That 
makes it easier to hear the difference moving a single slider has on the sound.
4 Raise the 1.4kHz control to 0 (values above 0 produce runaway echo) and note 
how the sound is more “midrangey.”
5 Bring down the 1.4kHz slider and raise the 7.4kHz slider to 0. Now the echoes 
are brighter.
6 Return the 7.4kHz slider to -15dB, and raise the 172Hz slider to 0. The echoes 
are now bassy.
7 You can vary more than one slider at a time to create a more complex 
equalization curve, as well as enable Echo Bounce to have each channel’s echo 
bounce between the left and right channels. 
Filter and eQ effects
Equalization is an extremely important effect for adjusting tonality. For example, 
you can “brighten” muffled narration by boosting the treble or make tinny, thin-
sounding voices sound fuller by increasing the low frequencies. Equalization can 
also help differentiate among different instruments; for example, bass guitar and 
a drum kit’s kick drum both occupy the low frequencies and can interact in a way 
that makes each one less distinct. To solve this problem, some engineers might 
emphasize the bass’s highs to bring out pick and string noise, whereas others boost 
highs on the kick to bring out the “thwack” of the beater.
Adobe Audition has four different equalizer effects, each used for different purposes, 
that can adjust tonality and solve frequency-response related problems: Parametric 
Equalizer, Graphic Equalizer, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Filter, and Notch Filter. 
Parametric equalizer
The Parametric Equalizer offers nine stages of equalization. Five stages have a 
parametric response, which can boost (make more prominent) or cut (make less 
prominent) specific ranges (“bands”) of the frequency spectrum. Each parametric 
equalization stage has three parameters.
E Tip: To set both 
channels to the same 
Delay Time, enable 
Lock Left and Right. 
Adjusting either 
channel will adjust the 
other to the same value.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 79
Caution: In the following lesson, keep monitor levels down as you make adjustments. 
The Parametric Equalizer is capable of high amounts of gain at the selected frequencies.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drums+Bass+Arp110.wav.
2 In any Effects Rack insert, click the right arrow, and choose Filter and EQ > 
Parametric Equalizer. Start playback.
3 Note the five numbered boxes. Each represents a controllable parametric stage. 
Click one of them (e.g., 3) and drag up to boost response, or drag down to 
reduce response. Drag left to affect lower frequencies or right to affect higher 
frequencies. Listen to how this changes the sound.
4 In the area below the graph, each parametric stage shows the Frequency, Gain, 
and Q/Width parameters. Click on the Q/Width parameter and drag up to 
narrow the range affected by the boost or cut, or drag down to widen the range. 
You can also click on the stage’s number to toggle that stage on or off.
5 Load the Default preset to restore the EQ to having no effect. The L and H 
squares control a low shelf and high shelf response, respectively. This starts 
boosting or cutting at the selected frequency, but the boost or cut extends 
outward toward the extremes of the audio spectrum. Past a certain frequency, 
the response hits a “shelf” equal to the maximum amount of cut.
6 Click on the H box and drag it up slightly. Note how this increases the treble. 
Now drag it to the left, and you’ll hear that the boost now affects a wider range 
of high frequencies. Similarly, click on the L box to hear how this affects the low 
frequencies. In the Parameter section for the Low and High shelf sections, you 
can click the Q/Width button to change the steepness of the shelf’s slope.
7 Reload the Default preset so the EQ has no effect. There are two additional 
stages, Highpass and Lowpass, which you enable by clicking on the HP and LP 
buttons, respectively. Click those buttons now.
8 A Highpass response progressively reduces response below a certain frequency 
(called the cutoff frequency); the lower the frequency is below the cutoff, the 
greater the reduction. A Highpass filter is helpful for removing subsonic (very 
low-frequency) energy. Click on the HP box and drag it to the right to hear how 
it affects low frequencies.
9 You can also change the filter slope’s steepness, in other words, the rate 
of attenuation compared to frequency. In the HP panel that displays its 
parameters, click the Gain drop-down menu and choose 6dB/octave. Note how 
this creates a gradual curve. Then select 48dB/octave to produce a steep curve.
10 Similarly, listen to how the Lowpass filter affects the sound by clicking the LP 
(Lowpass) button, dragging the LP box left or right, and choosing different curves 
as accessed from the Gain menu. Keep this project open for the next lesson.

80 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
All of these responses are available simultaneously. The screen shot shows a steep 
Highpass slope, a slight parametric boost with stage 2, a narrow parametric cut 
with stage 3, and a High shelf boost.
graphic equalizer (10 Bands)
A Graphic Equalizer can boost or cut with a fixed bandwidth at various fixed fre-
quencies. It gets its name because moving the sliders creates a “graph” of the filter’s 
frequency response.
Caution: In the following lesson, keep monitor levels down as you make adjustments. 
The Graphic Equalizer can produce high amounts of gain at specific frequencies.
1 Assuming Audition is still open and the file Drum+Bass+Arp110.wav is still 
loaded, click the right arrow of the insert that had the Parametric Equalizer 
loaded, and choose Filter and EQ > Graphic Equalizer (10 Bands). 
2 Start playback. Move the various sliders up and down to hear how each affects 
the timbre through varying the level within their respective frequency bands. In 
musical terms, each slider is an octave apart. Keep Audition open in preparation 
for the next lesson.
P Note: The strip along the bottom of the Graphic Equalizer screen has three additional 
parameters. Range sets the maximum available amount of boost or cut up to 120dB (which is 
a lot!). It’s easier to make fine adjustments with narrower ranges, like 6–12dB. Accuracy affects 
low-frequency processing. If you’re doing significant amounts of low-frequency boost or cut, raise 
Accuracy if it improves the sound. Otherwise, leave it at the default of 1000 points to reduce CPU 
loading. Master gain compensates for Output level changes caused by using the EQ. Turn it down if 
you added lots of boosting; turn it up if you used lots of cutting.
graphic equalizer (20 Bands)
The Graphic Equalizer (20 Bands) works identically to the Graphic Equalizer (10 Bands) 
except the bands are half an octave apart, which provides greater resolution. To hear how 
it works, follow the same basic procedure as the lesson for the 10 Bands version.
P Note: The strip 
along the bottom of 
the screen has three 
additional options. 
Constant Q, where Q 
is a ratio compared 
to frequency, is most 
common, whereas 
Constant Width means 
the Q is the same 
regardless of frequency. 
The Ultra-Quiet option 
reduces noise and 
artifacts but requires 
much more processing 
power and can usually 
be left off. Range sets 
the maximum amount 
of boost or cut to 30dB 
or 96dB. The more 
common option is 30dB.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 81
graphic equalizer (30 Bands)
The Graphic Equalizer (30 Bands) works identically to the Graphic Equalizer (20 
Bands) except the bands are a third of an octave apart, which provides greater 
resolution. To hear how it works, follow the same basic procedure as the lesson for 
the 10 Bands version.
FFT Filter
The FFT Filter is an extremely flexible filter that lets you “draw” the frequency 
response. The default settings are a practical point of departure. FFT is a highly  
efficient algorithm commonly used for frequency analysis.
1 Assuming Audition is still open and the file Drum+Bass+Arp110.wav is still 
loaded, click the right arrow of the insert that had a Graphic Equalizer loaded, 
and choose Filter and EQ > FFT Filter. 
2 Start playback. Click on the graph to create a point; the blue line that indicates 
frequency response will move up or down as needed to “snap” to that point. 
You can then drag this point up, down, or sideways. You are not limited to the 
number of points you can add, which allows you to make very complex—and 
even truly bizarre—EQ curves and shapes.
3 For a smoother curve, enable Spline Curves. The screen shot on the left shows 
Spline Curves deselected and the original placement of points, whereas the 
screen shot on the right shows Spline Curves selected.
P Note: As for other FFT Filter parameters, for Scale choose Logarithmic when working primarily with 
low frequencies because this produces the best resolution for drawing in nodes. Linear has the same 
advantage at high frequencies. For the Advanced options, for the best accuracy with steep, precise 
filters, choose higher values like 8192 to 32678. Lower values produce fewer transients with percussive 
sounds. For Window, Hamming and Blackman are the best overall choices. The choices listed first 
narrow the shape of the response curve with subsequent choices progressively widening the shape.

82 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
notch Filter 
The Notch Filter is optimized to remove very specific frequencies in an audio file, 
like hum.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
ReduceHum.wav.
2 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Filter and EQ > Notch Filter. 
3 Bypass the Notch Filter, and then start playback. Note the huge amount of hum 
in the file.
4 Select the Notch Filter. The filter’s default setting is a good start (Europeans 
should select the 50Hz and Harmonics Removal preset instead of the 60Hz-based 
default), but note that there’s some ringing and an unnatural quality. You’ll now 
tweak the settings to reduce hum while retaining a natural sound.
5 There are six notches starting at 60Hz whose frequencies are set to harmonics 
of 60Hz. Turn off all notches that don’t improve the sound by clicking a notch’s 
enable button. Turn off notches 3, 4, 5, and 6. Note that this doesn’t increase the 
amount of hum. Turn off notches 1 and 2. These contribute hum, so reenable 
them and let’s work on optimizing these.
6 Reduce the gain for notches 1 and 2 to around -45dB.
7 For the most natural sound, you want to use the least amount of reduction 
consistent with reducing hum. Experiment with the Gain parameters for 
notches 1 and 2. You’ll probably be able to get by with about -36dB of cut.
8 Bypass the Notch Filter, and note how the hum increases. 
Modulation effects
Unlike some of the previous effects we’ve discussed, modulation effects aren’t 
designed to solve problems as much as add “spice” to sounds in the form of special 
effects. These tend to produce very specific sounds, and the presets included with 
Adobe Audition are a good place to start. Therefore, with most of these effects, 
you’ll call up presets to hear how they affect the sound. But there will also be some 
analysis of which parameters are most important for editing.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 83
chorus 
Chorus can turn a single sound into what seems like an ensemble. This effect uses 
short delays to create additional “voices” from the original signal. These delays 
are modulated so that the delay varies slightly over time, which produces a more 
“animated” sound. 
The Chorus effect is optimized for stereo signals, so convert mono signals to stereo 
for best results. To do this, choose Edit > Convert Sample Type, and from the 
Channels drop-down menu, choose Stereo. Then click OK.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
FemaleChoir.wav. Play the file to hear what it sounds like.
2 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Modulation > Chorus. 
3 Note how with Chorus enabled the Default preset creates a fuller and bigger 
sound. Select Highest Quality; most modern computers can provide the 
additional processing power this option needs. If the audio crackles or breaks 
up, deselect this option.
4 Increase Modulation Depth to 8dB or so. Notice how the sound becomes more 
animated. To make this more obvious, increase the Modulation Rate to 2.5Hz. 
Modulation Depth and Rate interact; with a higher Rate, you’ll usually want a 
lower Depth. Return Modulation Depth to 0.
5 To increase the “number of people” in the chorus, click the Voices drop-down 
menu and choose 16 voices. Because this adds a lot more audio, you may need 
to bring down the Output control in the Effects Rack panel to avoid distortion. 
6 Increasing the Delay Time can also make a bigger sound, but too much Delay 
Time may produce an “out of tune” effect. Set it to around 40ms for now.
7 Spread increases the stereo image width. Set it to around 152ms. Bypass/enable 
the Chorus to hear the effect of these edits.
8 With Chorus enabled, note the Dry and Wet Output level controls. For a more 
subtle effect, set a higher Dry value and lower Wet value, or turn up only the 
Wet sound for the most “diffused” character. 
9 Be careful with Feedback, because even slight amounts can add uncontrolled 
feedback. Values up to about 10 can produce a more “swirling” sound for 
the Chorus.
10 The remaining controls apply to stereo imaging. Stereo Field makes the output 
narrower or wider. For Average Left & Right Channel Output and Add Binaural 
Cues, simply select these. If you like the sound better, leave them selected. If 
there’s no audible difference, leave them deselected. Leave Average Left & Right 
Channel Output deselected if the original signal was mono.

84 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
11 To get a sense of how you can also use the Chorus effect for special effects, try 
working with the other presets. Note that some of the more bizarre sounds 
combine lots of modulation, feedback, or long delay times.
12 Leave Audition open in preparation for the lesson on the next effect.
Flanger 
Like Chorus, Flanger uses short delays, but they’re even shorter to create phase 
cancellations that result in an animated, moving, resonant sound. This effect was 
popularized in the 1960s due to its “psychedelic” properties.
1 Assuming that Audition is open and the FemaleChoir.wav file is loaded, click the 
right arrow of the current effect’s insert, and choose Modulation > Flanger to 
replace the Chorus effect. Play the file to hear what it sounds like.
2 For a more pronounced effect, set the Mix to 50%. Alter the Feedback setting; 
more feedback produces a more resonant sound.
3 An important element of Flanging relates to modulating the delay. Stereo 
Phasing changes the phase relationship of the modulation; when set to 0, the 
modulation is the same in both channels. Increase the Phasing amount to offset 
the modulation in the two channels, which creates more of a stereo effect. Vary 
the Modulation Rate to change the modulation speed.
4 Initial Delay Time and Final Delay Time set the Flanger sweep range. The 
“standard” range is 0 to around 5ms; increasing the final Delay Time produces a 
sound that’s more like chorusing when the Flanger delay time reaches the longer 
delay. Experiment with these options.
5 The Mode options are used for specialized effects. Selecting Inverted changes 
the tone. Special Effects changes the flanging “character”: Enable it and see 
if you like what it does. The effect varies depending on the other parameter 
settings. Finally, Sinusoidal changes the modulation waveform to produce a 
somewhat more “rolling” modulation effect.
6 Call up other presets, particularly the vocal flange presets, to get a sense of 
the range of possibilities that the Flanger can offer. Many of the more radical 
patches use either high Modulation Rates, large amounts of Feedback, longer 
Initial or Final Delay Times, or a combination of these.
7 Leave Audition open in preparation for the lesson on the next effect.
Chorus/Flanger offers a choice of Chorus or Flanger; each is a simpler version of 
the Chorus and Flanger described previously. Width is essentially the same as vary-
ing Delay in the Chorus or Flanger, whereas Width basically determines the wet/
dry mix. Speed provides the same function as Modulation Rate. The only different 
control is Transience, which emphasizes transients to produce a “sharper” sound.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 85
1 Assuming that Audition is open and the FemaleChoir.wav file is loaded, click 
the right arrow of the current effect’s insert, and choose Modulation > Chorus/
Flanger to replace the Flanger effect.
2 Load the various presets to hear the types of effects each processor provides.
3 Leave Audition open in preparation for the next lesson.
Phaser
The Phaser effect is similar to Flanging but has a different, and often more subtle, 
character because it uses a specific type of filtering called an allpass filter to accom-
plish its effect instead of delays.
1 Assuming that Audition is open and the FemaleChoir.wav file is loaded, click 
the right arrow of the current effect’s insert, and choose Modulation > Phaser to 
replace the Chorus/Flanger effect. Play the file.
2 Phasing tends to be most effective when processing the midrange. Change the 
Upper Freq to around 2000Hz.
3 As with Flanging, you can offset the modulation for the left and right channels. 
The farther you move the Phase Difference away from the center (0) position, 
the greater the stereo effect. Leave it at 180 for now.
4 Moving Feedback off center to more positive values increases the phaser’s 
sharpness, producing a “whistling” sound. More negative values produce a 
subtler, “hollower” sound. Leave it at 0. 
5 Vary the Mod Rate slider. Note how at faster settings the effect is almost like 
vibrato. Return it to 0.25Hz before proceeding.
6 The remaining parameters set the degree of “drama” in the phased sound:
• More Stages produces a more profound effect.
• Intensity determines how much phase-shifting the Phaser applies (you’ll 
typically want this above 90 unless you prefer a more “static” sound).
• Depth sets the lower frequency limit that Modulation attains. This 
complements the Upper Frequency parameter, which is the highest 
frequency that Modulation attains.
• Mix sets the blend of wet and dry sounds. A 50% value produces the 
maximum phasing effect by mixing dry and wet signals in equal proportion. 
Moving the value toward 0 increases the proportion of dry signal to wet 
signal, whereas moving the value toward 100 increases the proportion of wet 
signal to dry signal. 
Experiment with these parameters to hear how they affect the sound.
7 Load the various presets to hear the types of effects each processor provides.

86 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
noise reduction/restoration
Noise reduction and noise restoration are such important topics that these proces-
sors are covered in detail in Lesson 5, “Audio Restoration,” which describes Adobe 
Audition’s many options for audio restoration. These include the ability to remove 
noise, delete pops and clicks, minimize the sound caused by scratches in vinyl 
records, reduce tape hiss, and more.
reverb effects
Reverberation imparts an acoustic space’s characteristics (room, concert hall, 
garage, plate reverb) to audio. Two common reverb processes are convolution 
reverb and algorithmic reverb. Audition includes both.
Convolution Reverb is generally the more realistic sounding of the two. It loads 
an impulse, which is an audio signal (typically WAV file format) that embodies 
the characteristics of a particular, fixed acoustic space. The effect then performs 
convolution, a mathematical operation that operates on two functions (the impulse 
and the audio) to create a third function that combines the impulse and the audio, 
thus impressing the qualities of the acoustic space onto the audio. The trade-off for 
realism is a lack of flexibility.
Algorithmic Reverb creates an algorithm (mathematical model) of a space with variables 
that allow for changing the nature of that space. It’s therefore easy to create differ-
ent rooms and effects with a single algorithm, whereas for convolution reverb, you 
would need to load different impulses for fundamentally different sounds. All Audition 
reverbs other than the Convolution Reverb use algorithmic reverb technology.
Each type of reverb is useful. Some engineers prefer algorithmic reverbs because 
it’s possible to create “idealized” reverb spaces; others prefer convolution due to 
its “real” feel. 
convolution reverb
The convolution type of reverb can produce extremely realistic reverberation 
effects, and as described later, can also be useful for sound design. However, it is a 
CPU-intensive process.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drums110.wav. Play the file to hear what it sounds like.
2 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Reverb > Convolution Reverb. 
3 Load some presets to get a sense of what convolution reverb can do. When 
you’re done, load the Memory Space preset.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 87
4 Load different impulses from the Impulse drop-down menu. Note how each 
impulse produces a different reverb character. When you’re done, load the Hall 
impulse so you can check out how the various parameters affect the sound.
5 Vary Mix to change the ratio of dry to wet sounds.
6 Room Size changes the size of the hall. Listen carefully to the degree of control 
this option provides, because you’ll be comparing the range available with 
algorithmic reverb.
7 Damping LF and Damping HF affect frequency response. Move the Damping 
LF slider to the left to simulate the effect of a room with lots of sound-absorbing 
material, which absorbs high frequencies more readily than low frequencies. 
Move the Damping HF slider to the left to remove lower frequencies, creating a 
“thinner” but also less “muddy” reverb character.
8 Pre-Delay sets the time before a sound first occurs and when it reflects off a 
surface. Move the Pre-Delay slider to the right to increase the pre-delay amount, 
which implies a longer time for the sound to reflect, hence a bigger space.
9 Move Width farther to the right to create a wider stereo image; move the 
slider to the left to narrow the image. Adjust Gain to set the overall gain of 
the composite wet/dry sound. This will typically be at 0 unless you need to 
compensate for signal level variations caused by adding the reverb effect.
10 Leave Audition open for the next lesson.
Studio reverb
We’re covering these reverbs out of sequence because the Studio Reverb is an 
algorithmic reverb that’s simple, effective, and works in real time so it’s easy to hear 
the results of changing parameters. Many of the Full Reverb and Reverb parameters 
cannot be adjusted during playback, because they are very CPU-intensive.
1  Assuming that Audition is open and the Drums110.wav file is loaded, click the 
right arrow of the current effect’s insert, and choose Reverb > Studio Reverb to 
replace the Convolution Reverb effect. 
2 With the Default preset selected, vary the Decay slider. Note how the range is 
much wider than the Convolution Reverb’s Room Size parameter.
3 Algorithmic reverbs contain two main components: early reflections and a 
reverb “tail.” The early reflections simulate the discrete echoes caused when 
a sound first bounces off multiple room surfaces. The tail is the “wash” of 
composite echoes that have bounced around the room multiple times. Drag the 
Decay slider all the way to the left, and then vary the Early Reflections slider. 
Increasing early reflections creates an effect somewhat like a small acoustic 
space with hard surfaces.
E Tip: You can use 
Convolution Reverb 
to load most WAV files 
by clicking Load and 
navigating to a WAV file. 
Online sources offer free 
impulses that work with 
standard convolution 
reverbs, including 
Audition’s, which make 
it easy to expand your 
options. Also, you can 
load phrases, loops, 
sound effects, or other 
“nonacoustic space” 
files and obtain some 
pretty wild—and 
unpredictable—effects. 
These can be valuable 
for sound design and 
special effects.
E Tip: Low to 
moderate Early 
Reflections settings, 
with Decay set to 
minimum, can add a 
little bit of ambience to 
otherwise “dry” sounds. 
This can make narration 
seem more “real.”

Lesson 4 
signal Processing
4 Set Decay to about 6000ms and Early Reflections to 50%. Adjust the Width 
control to set the stereo imaging, from narrow (0) to wide (100).
5 High Frequency Cut works similarly to the Convolution Reverb’s Damping LF 
but covers a wider range. Move the slider more to the left to reduce the high 
frequencies for a darker sound or more to the right for a brighter sound.
6 Low Frequency Cut resembles the Convolution Reverb’s Damping HF. Move the 
LF Cut slider to the right to reduce low-frequency content, which can “tighten 
up” the low end and reduce “muddiness,” or more to the left if you want the 
reverb to affect lower frequencies.
7 Damping provides the same function as the Convolution Reverb’s Damping LF 
parameter. The difference between damping and High Frequency Cut is that 
damping applies progressively more high-frequency attenuation the longer a sound 
decays, whereas the high frequency cut is constant. Experiment with damping.
8 Vary the Diffusion control. At 0% the echoes are more discrete. At 100% they’re 
blended together into a smoother sound. In general, high-diffusion settings 
are common with percussive sounds; low-diffusion settings are used with 
sustaining sounds (e.g., voice, strings, organ, etc.).
9 The Output level section varies the amount of dry and wet audio. Experiment 
with these options.
10 Leave Audition open for the next lesson.
reverb 
When you call up the Reverb effect, you’ll likely see a warning alerting you that this 
is a CPU-intensive effect and advising you to apply the effect before playback. Also, 
you cannot adjust the reverb characteristics in real time—only when playback is 
stopped. You can edit the dry and wet levels at any time.
1  Assuming that Audition is open and the Drums110.wav file is loaded, click the 
right arrow of the current effect’s insert, and choose Reverb > Reverb to replace 
the Studio Reverb effect. 
2 Call up various presets and vary the dry and wet sliders. Because you’re 
processing a drum sound, Big Drum Room and Thickener can be very useful; 
they’re designed specifically to enhance drums.
3 The remaining parameters (Decay Time, Pre-Delay Time, and Diffusion) 
perform the same function as the like-named parameters in the Studio Reverb 
and Convolution Reverb. You’ve already heard the sonic results caused by 
changing these sliders in the previous lessons, but if you want to hear how 
they alter the sound in this particular reverb, vary these sliders and listen to 
how they change the sound. The Perception slider is similar to high-frequency 
damping; at 0 the sound is “duller” and softer, whereas a setting of 200 simulates 
E Tip: Engineers 
often reduce the low 
frequencies on reverb to 
prevent adding reverb 
to bass and drums, 
which can produce a 
“muddy” sound.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 89
more irregularities in the listening environment, so the sound is brighter and 
“harder.” Try different settings of the Perception slider and listen to the results; 
the difference is relatively subtle. Leave Audition open.
Full reverb
Full Reverb is a convolution-based reverb and is the most sophisticated of the various 
reverbs but also the most impractical to use because of the heavy CPU loading. No 
parameters other than the level controls for dry, reverb, and early reflections levels 
can be adjusted during playback, and even then, the level control settings take several 
seconds to take effect (however, if you stop playback and adjust them, the change 
occurs immediately on playback). Also, if you change any of the non-level reverb 
parameters while stopped, it can take several seconds before playback begins. As a 
result, this is a processor where you’ll probably want to start with a preset that’s as 
close as possible to what you want and make a few tweaks as needed.
1  Assuming that Audition is open and the Drums110.wav file is loaded, click the 
right arrow of the current effect’s insert, and choose Reverb > Full Reverb to 
replace the Reverb effect. 
2 Start by calling up some presets to get an idea of the Full Reverb’s sonic potential.
3 The Reverberation parameters (Decay Time, Pre-Delay Time, Diffusion, and 
Perception) are functionally identical to the same controls in the Reverb 
processor. However, the Early Reflections options are more sophisticated 
than any of the other reverbs. With playback stopped, turn the Dry and 
Reverberation Output Level controls to 0 and Early Reflections to 100 so you 
can easily hear the results of changing the related parameters.
4 Use the Room Size and Dimension controls to create a virtual room. Bigger room 
sizes create longer reverbs. Dimension sets the ratio of width to depth; values 
below 0.25 can sound unnatural, but try this for special effect-type sounds (reduce 
the monitor volume first because the volume may increase unexpectedly).
5 High Pass cutoff works the same way as the High Frequency cutoff control in the 
Studio Reverb. Move the slider more to the left to reduce the high frequencies 
for a darker sound or more to the right for a brighter sound. Left/right location 
moves the early reflections from stereo more toward the left or right by moving 
the slider more to the left or right, respectively; if you want the source from which 
the reflections are derived to move with it, choose Include Direct.
6 The Coloration tab opens up a three-band EQ with a high shelf, low shelf, and 
single parametric stage. You’ve already learned how equalization works, but 
there’s also a Decay parameter. This sets the time before the coloration EQ takes 
effect. Set it to 0 as you experiment with the parametric parameters so you 
can hear the results as quickly as possible. As just one example, reducing highs 
produces a “warmer” reverb sound.

Lesson 4 
signal Processing
Special effects
Two individual effects—Distortion and Vocal Enhancer—are discussed in this 
section as well as two “multieffects” for Guitar and Mastering that include several 
compatible effects designed to work together.
Distortion
Distortion occurs by clipping a signal’s peaks, which creates harmonics. Audition’s 
distortion can create different amounts of clipping for positive and negative peaks 
to produce asymmetrical distortion (which can give a more “jagged” sound) or 
link the settings for both peaks to produce symmetrical distortion, which tends to 
sound somewhat smoother.
1 Assuming Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the 
program, choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Bass110.wav. Play the file to hear what it sounds like.
2 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Special > Distortion. 
3 The Default preset has no distortion, because the curves represent a linear 
relationship between input and output with no clipping. Load various presets 
to get a sense of the sounds this effect can create, and then return to the 
Default preset.
4 Now you’ll create some light distortion to give the bass some “crunch.” Click 
the Link button (under the cursor in the screen shot) between the two graphs 
so that adjusting one curve affects the other. (Note that clicking one of the two 
arrows below the Link button transfers one curve’s settings to the other.) 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 91
5 With the bass file playing, click the white square in the upper-right corner of a 
graph’s curve. Drag it down to -15 or so, and you’ll hear the sound become more 
distorted as you lower the level where the signal clips. Because more clipping 
leads to lower levels, you’ll need to increase the Effects Rack’s Output control 
to compensate.
6 You can boost lower levels so that they distort more readily. Click at the 
intersection of the two -30 levels on the X and Y axes. This creates a new node 
on the curve; you’ll hear more distortion.
7 Drag this new node up to increase the volume of low-level signals, thus creating 
more distortion. Dragging the node to the left also increases distortion by 
allowing lower levels to distort. 
8 To remove a node, right-click (Control-click) on it. Continue adding and 
moving nodes to hear how this affects the sound. When there are multiple 
nodes, you can smooth the curve that incorporates them by increasing the 
Curve Smoothing parameter value.
9 Click a graph’s reset button (the spiral arrow). If the graphs are still linked, 
you’ll reset them both simultaneously; otherwise you’d need to reset them 
individually. With the graphs unlinked, bring the upper-right square for one of 
the graphs down to -20dB. This adds crunch but also preserves the “fullness” of 
the bass by leaving one set of peaks alone.
10 The Time Smoothing parameter changes the distortion’s reaction time to level 
changes, particularly at lower frequencies. Increase Time Smoothing, and the 
distortion becomes smoother and less harsh. Choose a value of 30%, and then 
bypass/enable the distortion to compare the distorted and undistorted sound. 
Note how the smoothing creates a softer kind of distortion quality that gives 
the bass a bit of “snarl” but still sounds musical. Processing a bass with a hint of 
distortion can help it stand out more in a mix.
Vocal enhancer
The Vocal Enhancer effect is one of Audition’s easiest effects to use because it has 
only three options.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
NarrationNeedsHelp.wav. Play the file.
2 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Special > Vocal Enhancer. 
3 Click Male to reduce the low end somewhat to minimize p-popping and 
booming; note that it also helps even out the level variations a bit.
4 Load the file Drum+Bass+Arp110.wav, and insert the Vocal Enhancer in the 
Effects Rack. Select the Vocal Enhancer’s Music option.
P Note: Regarding 
the other Distortion 
parameters, dB Range 
changes the range 
covered by the graph 
and limits possible 
distortion settings to 
the selected range. 
Linear scale changes 
the calibration; 
logarithmic more 
closely approximates 
the way the ear 
responds. Leave 
Post-Filter DC Offset 
selected because it can 
prevent the addition 
of a constant offset 
that can lead to clicks 
when editing. There’s 
no disadvantage to 
leaving it on.

92 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
5 Bypass the Vocal Enhancer. You’ll hear that the music is brighter, which could 
potentially interfere with vocal intelligibility. Enabling the Vocal Enhancer’s 
Music option creates more “space” for voice-over.
6 With the same file playing, click the Male and Female options. You’ll hear how 
this affects music, which makes the changes in frequency response more obvious.
guitar Suite
The Guitar Suite is a “channel strip” that emulates a guitar signal processing chain. It 
includes four main processors, each of which can be bypassed or enabled individually:
• Compressor. Because guitar is a percussive instrument, many guitar players use 
compression to even out the dynamic range and produce more sustain.
• Filter. This shapes the guitar’s tone.
• Distortion. This is a “condensed” version of the Distortion processor and offers 
three popular distortion types.
• Amplifier. A large part of a guitar’s sound is the amplifier through which it 
plays: The number of speakers and the size of each, as well as the cabinet, have 
a major effect on the sound. Fifteen types are available, including a cabinet for 
bass guitar.
However, Guitar Suite is useful for more than guitars—you’ll also apply this versa-
tile effects suite to drums.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file Guitar.
wav. Play the file.
2 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Special > Guitar Suite. 
3 Call up the preset Big and Dumb, which makes a great start for a classic rock 
guitar sound.
4 Vary the Compressor Amount slider. The sound will be more percussive to the 
left and more sustained (with a slight volume drop) to the right. Set the Amount 
to 70 before proceeding.
5 Vary the Distortion Amount slider. The sound is “cleaner” to the left and 
“dirtier” to the right. Try the three different distortion types from the Distortion 
Type drop-down menu, and vary the Amount slider. Garage Fuzz is more 
punk, Smooth Overdrive more rock, and Straight Fuzz emulates the sound of a 
distortion effect box rather than an amp. Return to Smooth Overdrive, and set 
the slider to 90.
6 That sound seems a little harsh, but you can make it smoother with the filter. 
Deselect the Filter bypass check box.
E Tip: Because 
there aren’t any Voice 
Enhancer variable 
parameters, simply 
try the different 
options with voice (or 
background music in 
the case of the Music 
setting), and if it does 
not sound better, simply 
remove the effect.
E Tip: Many guitar 
sounds use distortion. 
However, you want to 
avoid unintentional 
distortion caused by 
overloading within 
Audition and use 
only the intentional 
distortion created 
by the Guitar Suite 
processor. Guitar 
processors can cause 
wide level swings, so 
pay close attention to 
the Effects Rack panel’s 
Input and Output 
controls to make sure 
they don’t go into the 
red zone. 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 93
7 Move the Freq slider to around 1500Hz with Resonance at 0. This removes some 
of the “edge.” Note how increasing Resonance makes the sound “sharper.” Leave 
Resonance at 0 for now.
8 To hear how different amplifiers affect the sound, choose various options 
from the Amplifier Box drop-down menu—Classic British Stack, Classic 
Warm, 1960s American, 1970s Hard Rock, and Deep 4x12 are some of the 
most realistic emulations. Also note that there are six non-amp and special 
FX sounds. Bypassing the Amplifier emphasizes just how much speakers and 
cabinets influence the tone.
9 Return to the Big and Dumb preset, but choose Classic British Stack for the 
Amplifier Box parameter. Deselect the Filter bypass check box.
10 The Filter precedes the Distortion section. Therefore, reducing signal levels due 
to filtering will result in less distortion. Often, this is the sound you want, but 
if you feel the overall level is too low, move the Distortion Amount slider to the 
right to compensate.
11 With Retro selected as the Filter, choose Bandpass for the Type (this is like a 
Parametric EQ stage without the boost/cut control). For a big, metal sound, set 
Freq to around 435Hz and Resonance to 20 to produce a little response peak at 
that frequency.
12 You’ve already worked with Lowpass and Highpass filters in previous sections 
on equalizers (Lowpass reduces highs; Highpass reduces lows); Resonance is 
equivalent to the Q control you used with some of the equalizers. Feel free to 
experiment at this point, but if you’re impatient to discover some other filter 
types, proceed to the next step.
13 Choose Rez as the Filter and Bandpass as the Type (the other responses work 
too, but these produce the most obvious effect), and set Resonance to 0. Vary 
the Freq slider, and you’ll hear a resonant effect like a wah pedal. Turn up 
Resonance if you really want to go overboard.
14 Each of the remaining five filters has a fixed frequency that corresponds roughly 
to the mouth’s filtering effect when forming various vowels. Change the Freq 
slider position; note that this doesn’t change the TalkBox filter frequency per se
but acts more like a “window” that sweeps across the filter frequency, making it 
more or less prominent.
15 Load the TalkBox U filter and select Bandpass for Type. With Resonance at 
0, move the Freq slider across its range. The peak level will be around 1kHz; 
moving the Freq slider to either side reduces the level somewhat and also 
changes the timbre.
16 The Guitar Suite is also suitable for other instruments, particularly drums. 
Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drums110.wav.

94 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
17 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Special > Guitar Suite. 
Load the Big And Dumb preset.
18 Enable the Filter, and move the Freq slider to around 3000Hz. Set Resonance 
to 20%. 
19 Although you’ll hear a good “trash” drum sound, you can tame it by moving the 
Mix Amount slider to the left (try 30–40%). This adds the dry drum sound in 
with the “trash” sound so that the overall sound is more defined.
Mastering
Mastering is another effects “suite.” Adobe Audition already excels at mastering, so 
including a Mastering suite may seem redundant. However, it provides a quick way to 
master material that doesn’t require creating an à la carte set of mastering processors.
The suite includes the following effects:
• Equalizer. Includes a low shelf, high shelf, and parametric (peak/notch) 
stage. Its parameters work similarly to the same parameters in the Parametric 
Equalizer effect. The Equalizer also includes a real-time graph in the 
background that shows the current frequency response spectrum. This helps 
with making EQ adjustments; for example, if you see a huge bass “bump” in the 
low end, the bass probably needs to be reduced.
• Reverb. Adds ambience if needed.
• Exciter. Creates high-frequency “sparkle” that’s unlike conventional treble-
boosting EQ.
• Widener. Allows for widening or narrowing the stereo image.
• Loudness Maximizer. Is a dynamics processor that increases the average level 
for a louder sound without exceeding the available headroom.
• Output Gain. Can be adjusted to control the effect output and therefore 
compensate for any level changes due to adding various processes.
You'll use the Mastering Suite to give greater clarity to a piece of music.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
DeepTechHouse.wav. Play the file. Note that there are two problems: The bass 
“booms” a bit too much, and the high end lacks definition.
2 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and then choose Special > Mastering. 
3 Call up the preset Subtle Clarity. Toggle the power button to enable/bypass the 
preset’s effect; note how this indeed produces more clarity.
4 You’ll now fix the bass. Select Low Shelf Enable; a small X appears toward the left, 
which you click on and drag to change the shelf characteristics. Resume playback.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 95
5 Drag the Low Shelf marker right to around 240Hz. Then drag down to about 
-2.5dB. Enable/bypass the Mastering effect, and you’ll hear that when Mastering 
is enabled, the low end is tighter and the high end is more defined.
6 The Reverb is not intended to provide big hall effects but adds ambience when 
used subtly. It’s set to 20% in the preset; move it left to 0%, and the sound will be 
a little “dryer.” A value of 10% seems to work well for this tune.
7 Most of the preset’s additional “clarity” is due to the slight upper midrange boost 
around 2033Hz working in conjunction with the Exciter, which affects the highest 
frequencies. A little bit of Exciter effect goes a long way. Drag its slider to the 
right, and the sound will become way too bright. Because the song is already fairly 
bright, disable the Exciter effect by dragging its slider all the way to the left. (Note 
that the sonic difference among the three characters of Retro, Tape, and Tube 
becomes most noticeable with dull material and high Exciter amounts.)
8 Adjust the Widener to taste; end on a setting around 60.
9 The Loudness Maximizer can increase the apparent loudness for a more 
“punchy” sound. However, as with the Exciter, you can have too much of a good 
thing. Excessive maximization can lead to ear fatigue, as well as make the music 
less interesting by reducing dynamics. For this song, set it to 30 to provide a 
useful boost without adding a distorted or unnatural sound.
10 Because the Loudness Maximizer will prevent the level from exceeding 0, you 
can leave the Output Gain at 0.
11 Toggle the power button to enable/bypass the effect and listen to the difference. 
The mastered version has more sparkle, the bass is in proper proportion with 
respect to level, the stereo image is wider, and there’s been a subjective overall 
level boost.
E Tip: It might 
seem logical to set 
the Widener for the 
widest possible stereo 
image to create a 
more dramatic sound. 
However, emphasizing 
the extreme left and 
right areas of the 
stereo spectrum can 
deemphasize the center, 
thus unbalancing 
a mix. If you listen 
closely and move the 
slider between 0 and 
100, you’ll usually find 
a “sweet spot” that 
provides maximum 
width without altering 
the mix’s fundamental 
balance.

96 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
Stereo imagery effects
Stereo imagery effects alter a file’s stereo image. Audition includes two effects for 
altering stereo image: a Center Channel Extractor and a Graphic Phase Shifter. The 
latter is a very esoteric tool that you will likely not need to use when doing typical 
audio projects, so we’ll cover only the Center Channel Extractor. For further infor-
mation on either effect, refer to the Help files.
center channel extractor
With stereo signals, some sounds are traditionally mixed to center—particularly 
vocals, bass, and kick drum. Reversing the phase of one channel cancels out any 
material panned to center while leaving signals panned left and right alone. This is 
commonly used for karaoke to remove the vocal. By filtering the channel that’s out 
of phase to emphasize voice frequencies, bass and kick aren’t affected that much. 
However, Audition’s Center Channel Extractor is a very sophisticated implementa-
tion of this principle that allows for boosting or cutting the center channel, as well 
as includes precise filtering to help avoid applying the effect where it’s not wanted.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
DeepTechHouse.wav. Don’t start playback yet.
2 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Stereo Imagery > Center 
Channel Extractor. 
3 Call up the preset Boost Center Channel Bass, but turn down the monitoring 
level because the bass will be pretty loud.
4 Start playback and slowly turn up the monitoring level. The bass will be 
excessively loud, and you’ll need to pull back on the Effects Rack panel’s Output 
control to around -7dB to avoid distortion. 
5 Pull the Center Channel Level control down all the way, and the bass will 
essentially disappear. 
6 Return the Center Channel Level control to 0. Pull the Side Channel Levels 
control down all the way to isolate the bass.

The next lesson isolates vocals. 
1 Choose File > Close. Don’t save any changes.
2 Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
ContinentalDrift.wav. Don’t start playback yet.
3 Click the right arrow of an effect’s insert, and choose Stereo Imagery > Center 
Channel Extractor. 
4 Call up the preset Vocal Remove. Start playback around 32 seconds. The lead 
vocals extend to about 47 seconds, but you won’t hear them because they’re 
being removed (around 45 seconds you’ll hear some backup vocals that aren’t 
removed because they aren’t panned to center).
5 Return to around 32 seconds and start playback. Bring up the Center Channel 
Level to hear the vocals. 
6 You can access several real-time adjustments via the Discrimination tab. Choose 
the highest possible Crossover Bleed settings and the lowest possible Phase 
Discrimination, Amplitude Discrimination, and Amplitude Bandwidth settings 
that are consistent with sound quality and effectiveness. Increasing the Spectral 
Decay Rate will often improve sound quality as well.
You’ve now learned the highlights of the Center Channel Extractor; refer to 
Audition’s Help file for more details on this relatively esoteric effect.
Time and Pitch effect
The sole effect under the Time and Pitch effect, Automatic Pitch Correction, 
is designed for vocals and corrects the pitch of notes so that they are in tune. 
However, be careful when applying this effect; many vocalists deliberately sing 
some notes a little flat or sharp to add interest or tension to a vocal; correcting 
these can remove a vocal’s “human” quality.
automatic Pitch correction
Pitch correction is intended for vocals whose pitch is slightly out of tune. This effect 
analyzes the vocal to extract the pitch, calculates how far off a note is from the cor-
rect pitch, and then corrects the note by raising or lowering the pitch to compensate. 
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
OriginalVocal.wav. Don’t start playback yet.
2 Click an effect insert’s right arrow, and choose Time and Pitch > Automatic 
Pitch Correction. 
P Note:  Sample Magic 
produces the Deep Tech 
House sample library, 
whereas the Continental 
Drift sample library is 
made by Sony. These 
illustrate the range of 
music you can create 
from commercially 
available sample and 
loop libraries.

98 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
3 Bypass the Automatic Pitch Correction effect, and start playback. Observe the 
correction meter on the right: The red band indicates how far off the pitch is 
from the ideal. When the meter moves up, the pitch is sharp. When the meter 
moves down (see screen shot), the pitch is flat. A centered meter indicates that 
the vocal is on pitch. 
4 The Scale and Key options define the notes to which pitch should be corrected. 
For example, with a C major scale, the notes will be corrected to C, D, E, F, 
G, A, and B. However, to use this option, you need to know a vocal’s correct 
scale and key; choose these from the Scale and Key drop-down menus. If you 
do not know the Scale and Key choose Chromatic from the Scale drop-down 
menu, which simply corrects to the nearest semitone. (The vocal is in D but 
uses a flatted 7th note that is not part of the major scale. So, choose Chromatic 
instead.) In most cases, Chromatic will do the job.
5 Set the Sensitivity slider to 200 to correct all notes. At lower Threshold settings, 
notes that are off-pitch by more than the pitch threshold will be unaffected. 
6 Start playback with Automatic Pitch Correction still bypassed. It’s a good idea 
to loop this example so you don’t have to keep clicking Play. Listen for a few 
iterations of the loop, and then enable the effect.
7 Note how all the notes are on pitch. To compare, either bypass the effect or 
move the Sensitivity Fader to 0.
8 Move the Attack slider to 10. This produces the fastest response, so the 
Automatic Pitch Correction will attempt to pitch-correct the vibrato. You’ll hear 
a warbling sound, so use a slow enough setting to allow the vibrato to change 
pitch naturally. A setting of 2 to 4 is a good compromise between correcting 
pitch rapidly on sustained notes but not affecting vibrato.
9 Change the scale to Minor and Key to D. You’ll hear the vocal take on a more 
minor quality as notes are shifted to the appropriate pitches for a minor scale.
P Note: When a 
vocal has vibrato, 
the pitch will go 
somewhat sharp and 
flat periodically. This 
is normal and usually 
desirable; you can 
adjust the Automatic 
Pitch Correction to 
leave natural vibrato 
uncorrected.
P Note: As for the 
remaining Automatic 
Pitch Correction 
parameters, Reference 
Channel is useful 
only with stereo 
files. It chooses the 
channel from which 
the pitch profile 
should be calculated. 
FFT size trades off 
more accuracy (larger 
numbers) for faster 
response (smaller 
numbers). Calculation 
A4 sets the frequency 
in Hertz for the note A. 
In the United States 440 
is the standard, but this 
can be different in other 
countries and with 
some types of music.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 99
Third-party effects (VST and aU)
In addition to using Audition’s effects, you can load effects (plug-ins) made by other 
manufacturers. Audition is compatible with the following formats:
• VST (Virtual Studio Technology) is the most common Windows format and 
is also supported by the Mac. However, you need separate plug-in versions for 
Mac and Windows. For example, you can’t buy a particular VST plug-in for the 
Mac and use it with Windows. 
• VST3 is an updated version of VST2 that offers more efficient operation and 
other general improvements. Although not quite as common as standard VST, 
it’s gaining in popularity.
• AU (Audio Units) is Mac-specific, was introduced with OS X, and is the most 
popular and common format for the Mac.
On either platform, plug-ins are installed in specific hard drive folders. You need 
to let Audition know where to find these plug-ins. The information in the following 
sections applies to both Windows and Macs unless otherwise specified.
The audio Plug-in Manager
Audition’s Audio Plug-In Manager provides several functions:
• It scans your computer for plug-ins so Audition can use them and creates a list 
showing the name, type, status, and file path (where the plug-ins are located on 
your computer).
• It allows you to specify additional folders that contain plug-ins, and then re-scan 
these added folders. Most plug-ins install to default folders, and Audition scans 
these folders first. However, some plug-ins may install into a different folder, or 
you might want to create more than one folder of plug-ins. 
• It lets you enable or disable plug-ins. 
When you first open Audition, you’ll need to tell it to scan for plug-ins before they 
can be used in a project.
1 From the Effects option in the menu bar, choose Audio Plug-In Manager.
2 Click Scan for Plug-Ins. Audition must inspect your hard drive, so this can take 
a while.
When scanning is complete, you’ll see the plug-in listing and status, which 
usually indicates the manager is done. However, if needed, also complete the 
following steps.
3 To add an additional folder with plug-ins, click Add and navigate to the folder.
4 To enable or disable a particular plug-in, select the check box to the left of the 
plug-in’s name.
P Note: Both Windows 
and Mac offer 64-bit 
operating systems 
(Windows Vista and 
7, Mac OS X Lion and 
Mountain Lion), which 
can use 64-bit versions 
of plug-ins. Although 
Audition can run 
on 64-bit operating 
systems, it is a 32-bit 
application and is not 
compatible with 64-bit 
plug-ins on either Mac 
or Windows. However, 
very few plug-ins are 
64-bit only; almost 
all are available in 
32-bit versions that 
are compatible with 
Audition CS6.
P Note: Many free, 
legal plug-ins in a 
variety of formats 
are available on 
the Internet. These 
range from poorly 
coded effects 
made by beginning 
programmers to plug-
ins that are every bit as 
good—and sometimes 
better—than 
commercially available, 
professional products.

5 To re-scan the existing plug-ins, click Re-Scan Existing Plug-Ins.
Note that you can enable or disable all plug-ins by clicking the appropriate button.
6 When you’re finished with the Audio Plug-In Manager, click OK.
Using VST and aU plug-ins
VST and AU plug-ins appear as part of the same drop-down menu that opens when 
you click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow. For example, with Windows you’ll see 
entries for VST and VST3 effects along with the other entries for Modulation, Filter 
and EQ, Reverb, and the like; the Mac adds another entry for AU effects. Here’s 
how to use these effects in Audition.
1 Click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow.
2 Choose the entry (VST, VST3, or on the Mac, AU) containing the effect you 
want to insert.
3 Click the effect you want to insert, as you would with any of the effects included 
with Audition. 
P Note: Although 
rare, some plug-ins may 
be incompatible with 
Audition. This could be 
due to a nonstandard 
implementation, an 
older plug-in that was 
not updated, a bug 
within the plug-in that 
shows up only with 
particular programs, or 
a proprietary plug-in 
that’s not intended 
to work universally. If 
Audition encounters a 
plug-in it cannot load, 
the scanning process 
stops. If scanning 
doesn’t resume after 
a minute or so, click 
Cancel. Audition will 
enter the incompatible 
plug-in in the list of 
plug-ins, but it will 
be disabled. Run the 
scan as many times 
as necessary until the 
process completes.

Using the effects menu
You can process any audio selected in the Waveform or Multitrack Editor by choos-
ing the desired effect from the Effects menu. Unlike with the Effects Rack, you can 
apply only one effect at a time. 
This section covers effects that are available only from the Effects menu. Any effects 
you can also access from the Effects Rack work the same way when opened from 
the Effects menu with three exceptions:
• The Invert, Reverse, and Silence effects are applied to the audio as soon as you 
select them. You can use the Undo command to undo the effects.
• Most effects chosen via the effects categories (Amplitude and Compression, 
Delay and Echo, etc.) have an Apply and a Close button. Clicking Apply applies 
the effect to the selected audio.
• Unlike the Effects Rack, editing is destructive (although the changes aren’t made 
permanent unless and until the file is saved). However, you can still audition 
any changes before applying them, because most effects chosen via the effects 
categories have a Play and Loop button to the right of the effect’s power on/off 
button. Loop repeats the selected portion of the audio when you click Play.
invert, reverse, and Silence effects 
Invert changes the signal’s polarity (commonly called phase) and produces no audi-
ble difference. Reverse flips an audio selection so that the beginning occurs at the 
end and the end at the beginning. Silence replaces the selected audio with silence.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
NarrationNeedsHelp.wav. 
2 Play the file to hear what it sounds like, and then select the part at the beginning 
that says, “Most importantly, you need to maintain good backups of your data.”
3 Choose Effects > Invert. Note that the positive and negative sections are flipped, 
so the positive peaks are now negative and vice versa. However, if you play this, 
you’ll hear no audible difference.
4 Choose Effects > Reverse. Play back the selection, and you’ll hear reversed speech. 
5 Select the same section. Choose Effects > Silence to convert the audio to silence.
6 Close the File without saving it, but leave Audition open.

102 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
additional amplitude and compression effects
Three Effects menu functions are not available with the Effects Rack: Normalize, 
Fade Envelope, and Gain Envelope.
1 Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file Bass110.wav. 
2 Select a single bass note, and choose Effects > Amplitude and Compression > 
Normalize (process).
3 Normalization adjusts a selection’s level so that its peak (highest level) attains 
a particular percentage of the overall level. Set Normalize to 25% and click OK; 
the note’s peak will reach 25% of the maximum available level. 
4 Choose Edit > Undo or press Ctrl+Z (Command+Z) to restore the bass note to 
its previous level. 
5 Select the right half of the waveform (the first three notes), and choose Effects > 
Amplitude and Compression > Fade Envelope (process).
P Note: You can show 
the peak as either a 
percentage of the 
signal or the level in 
dB, referenced to the 
maximum available 
headroom. For 
example, if you select 
the dB radio button, 
25% normalization is 
equivalent to a peak 
that reaches -12dB. 
Normalize All Channels 
Equally treats the peaks 
for both channels 
similarly, and DC Bias 
Adjust ensures that a 
level of 0 is truly a value 
of 0. There’s no practical 
reason not to select 
this option.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 103
6 Load the Linear Fade In preset. A line that indicates amplitude appears 
superimposed on the selection. Play the file, either by clicking the Fade 
Envelope dialog box’s Play button or by pressing the spacebar, and you’ll hear 
the bass notes fade in.
7 You can adjust the fade shape by clicking on the line to create new nodes, as 
you did toward the end of Lesson 3, “Basic Editing.” A thumbnail in the Fade 
Envelope dialog box shows the shape; select the Spline Curves check box to 
round the fade line.
8 Select a different region. The curve now adapts to fit within the selection. 
Regardless of the size of the selection, the curve adapts proportionally to fit.
9 Click Close in the Fade Envelope dialog box without applying the fade.
10 Select part of the waveform, and choose Effects > Amplitude and 
Compression > Gain Envelope.
11 Select +3dB Hard Bump. A line that indicates amplitude appears superimposed 
on the selection. You can adjust the gain curve shape by clicking on the line to 
create new nodes, and as with the fade, a thumbnail in the Gain Envelope dialog 
box shows the shape. If desired, select the Spline Curves check box to round 
the fade line.
12 Select a different region. As with the Fade Envelope, the curve adapts to fit 
within the selection.
Diagnostic effects 
Diagnostic effects will be covered in Lesson 5 along with the real-time, nondestruc-
tive noise reduction and restoration tools. The Diagnostic effects produce the same 
sonic results but are destructive, DSP-based processes.
Doppler Shifter effect
The Doppler Shifter effect is an unusual effect that changes pitch and amplitude to 
make signals sound “three dimensional” as they circle around you, whiz by from 
left to right, and do other effects that alter spatial placement. 
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
FemaleChoir.wav.
2 Choose Effects > Special > Doppler Shifter. Click the dialog box’s Play button 
to hear the default effect. Like all of the Doppler Shifter presets, this effect is 
particularly dramatic on headphones.
3 Choose various presets. You may need to stop and restart Play between presets.

104 
Lesson 4 
signal Processing
4 The best way to understand how this effect works is to choose a Path Type 
(straight or circular), and then vary the parameters to hear how changes to 
specific parameters affect the sound. Take a few moments to do this now. You 
can get some really wild effects with this processor; note that you may need to 
stop and restart Play with major edits.
5 When you’re finished, close Audition without saving the file.
Manual Pitch correction effect
The Manual Pitch Correction effect is one of two Time and Pitch effects that are 
available only from the Effects menu.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open the file 
Drum+Bass+Arp110.wav.
2 Choose Effects > Time and Pitch > Manual Pitch Correction. The Waveform 
Editor changes to Spectral view, and the Manual Pitch Correction dialog box 
appears. Play the file as a reference.
3 The HUD has an additional control for pitch along with the standard volume 
control. Click on this control and drag down to lower pitch; drag up to 
raise pitch. For now, drag down to -200 cents (2 semitones). A yellow line 
superimposed on the Waveform overview shows the amount of pitch change.
4 Click Play to hear the sound transposed down to a lower pitch. 
5 Drag the HUD so it’s not on top of the yellow line. Click on the yellow line to 
create a node, which you can drag up or down to further change pitch. As with 
other Audition envelopes, you can insert multiple nodes and make complex 
curves, as well as round them off by selecting the Spline curves check box.
6 Click Close without applying the effect. Leave Audition open for the next lesson.
P Note: The Pitch 
Curve Resolution 
parameter trades off 
better accuracy (higher 
numbers) for faster 
response and lower 
CPU loading (lower 
numbers). For the 
Reference Channel, try 
both options and use 
whichever produces the 
highest-quality sound.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 105
Stretch and Pitch effect
The Stretch and Pitch effect is the other Time and Pitch effect that’s available only 
from the Effects menu. It offers high-quality time and pitch stretching.
1 Assuming the Drum+Bass+Arp110.wav file is still open, choose Effects > Time 
and Pitch > Stretch and Pitch. 
2 The default preset changes neither time nor pitch. Set the Stretch slider to 200%, 
click the dialog box’s Loop button, and then click Play. The file will now play at 
half speed.
3 Set the Stretch slider to 50%, and then click Play. The file now plays at double-
speed. After auditioning this change, reset the Stretch fader to 100%.
4 Vary the Pitch Shift slider and note how this affects the sound. There’s a slight 
delay before any pitch change takes effect, because Audition has to do a lot of 
calculations. You can shorten this time by selecting a level of Precision other 
than the default setting of High. 
5 Select Lock Stretch and Pitch Shift. This links the two parameters so that if, for 
example, you shift pitch up an octave, the speed doubles; shifting pitch down an 
octave halves the speed. For an interesting “slowdown” effect, set Stretch to 100%. 
Click Play, and then slowly move the Stretch slider to the right. With Stretch and 
Pitch Shift still locked, return the Stretch slider to 100% before proceeding.
6 You can also use the Stretch effect to change a file’s length. For example, the 
current file is 4.363 seconds long. Suppose it needs to be 5.00 seconds long. Select 
the Lock Stretch Settings to New Duration check box, and enter 5.00 for the New 
Duration parameter. Click Play; now the loop is exactly 5.00 seconds long. 
7 Because the stretch settings are locked to duration, the pitch will be somewhat 
lower because the file is longer. To preserve the pitch, deselect Lock Stretch 
Settings to New Duration, make sure Lock Stretch and Pitch Shift aren’t 
selected, and then set Pitch Shift to 0 semitones. When you’re finished, close 
Audition without saving the file.
8 The Advanced parameters are mostly important when manipulating voice; make 
sure the Solo Instrument or Voice and Preserve Speech Characteristics check 
boxes are selected, and adjust the Pitch Coherence slider for the best sound 
quality (this will be subtle). You can try deselecting Solo Instrument or Voice 
and Preserve Speech Characteristics with audio other than voice, but you may 
not hear much difference.
9 Click Close.
P Note: There are two 
algorithm choices in 
the Stretch and Pitch 
window, iZotope Radius 
and Audition. The 
Audition algorithm is 
less CPU-intensive, but 
the Radius algorithm 
has much better fidelity, 
and most modern 
computers will have no 
problem handling the 
extra CPU load.

Lesson 4 
signal Processing
Managing presets
When you create a particular effect you like, or even a complete Effects Rack 
configuration with multiple effects, you can save it as a preset for later recall. The 
preset header is similar for both individual effects and the Effects Rack.
create and select a preset 
Here’s how to create and save a preset for the Amplify effect that boosts gain by +2.5dB. 
1 Open Audition, navigate to the Lesson04 folder, and open any audio file you’d like.
2 Choose Effects > Amplitude and Compression > Amplify. Enter +2.5dB in the 
Left and Right Gain numeric fields.
3 Click the Save Settings as a Preset button to the right of the Presets field. A Save 
Effect Preset dialog box appears.
4 Enter a name for the preset, such as +2.5dB increase, and click OK. The preset 
name will then appear in the list of presets.
Delete a preset
To delete a preset, select it, and then click the Trash Can button to the right of the 
Save Settings as a Preset button.
create and select a favorite
If you create a preset you expect to use a lot, you can save it as a favorite.
1 When the preset settings are as desired, click the star button toward the upper-
right corner of the effect window.
2 Name this favorite preset in the dialog box that appears.
3 Click OK.
4 To access the favorite, select the audio you want to process, choose Favorites, 
and then select your favorite to apply the preset settings immediately to the 
selected audio.

1 What are the advantages of the Effects Rack, the Effects menu, and Favorites?
2 Is it possible to expand the roster of effects available to Audition?
3 Why is “gain-staging” important with the Effects Rack?
4 What is the difference between “dry” and “wet” audio?
5 What is the name of the process that allows for transposing pitch or lengthening/
shortening files? 
review answers
1 The Effects Rack allows you to make complex effects chains, the Effects menu includes 
additional effects and can apply single effects rapidly, and the Favorites presets can 
apply settings to audio immediately upon choosing the preset.
2 Audition can load third-party VST, VST3, and for the Mac, AU effects as well.
3 Effects can increase gain, thus causing distortion within the Effects Rack. By adjusting 
levels going into and out of the rack, it’s possible to avoid distortion.
4 Dry audio is unprocessed, whereas wet audio has been processed. Many effects let you 
alter the proportion of the two types of audio.
5 The processes are called high-quality time- and pitch-stretching, respectively.

Audio RestoRAtion 
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Remove hiss, like tape hiss or preamp noise 
• Reduce the level of clicks and pops automatically
• Minimize or even remove constant background noises like hum, 
air conditioning, ventilation system noise, and the like
• Remove undesired artifacts, like someone coughing in the middle 
of a live recording
• Do highly effective manual click and pop removal
• Use restoration tools to completely modify a drum loop
This lesson takes about 45 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve  
copied the Lesson05 folder that contains the audio examples into the 
Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

109
Audition offers tools for reducing hiss, hum, clicks, 
pops, and other types of noise. But you can also 
remove undesired artifacts by defining sections to be 
removed based on amplitude, time, and frequency.

110 
Lesson 5 
Audio Restoration
About audio restoration
Sometimes you’ll work with audio that needs restoration, like music from vinyl or 
cassette, or audio with hum, hiss, or other artifacts. Audition has multiple tools for 
solving these problems, including specialized signal processors and graphic wave-
form editing options.
However, audio restoration involves trade-offs. For example, removing the crack-
les from vinyl recordings may remove part of the sound that occurs during the 
crackles. So you may have to reconcile solving a problem with the infamous “law 
of unintended consequences.”
Nonetheless, as these lessons demonstrate, it’s possible to clean up audio signifi-
cantly while retaining sound quality.
Reducing hiss
Hiss is a natural by-product of electronic circuits, particularly high-gain circuits. 
Analog tape recordings always had some inherent hiss, but so do mic preamps and 
other signal sources. Audition provides two ways of reducing hiss (also see the sec-
tion “Reducing noise”); we’ll start with the easiest option.
1 With Audition open to the Waveform Editor, choose File > Open, navigate to 
the Lesson05 folder, and open the file Hiss.wav.
2 Click the Transport Play button, and you’ll hear obvious hiss, especially during 
quiet sections. Click the Transport Stop button.
3 Select the first two seconds of the audio file, which contain only noise (the “noise 
floor”). Audition will take a “noise print” (like a noise “fingerprint”) of this signal 
and subtract audio with only these hiss characteristics from the audio file.
4 Choose Effects > Noise Reduction/Restoration > Hiss Reduction (process).
E Tip: When mixing 
music that will be 
mastered, don’t trim a 
file up to the beginning; 
leave some of the track 
before the music begins. 
This can provide a noise 
floor reference if noise 
reduction is needed.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 111
5 Click the Capture Noise Floor button. A curve appears that shows the noise’s 
spectral distribution.
6 Extend the audio selection in the Waveform Editor to around 5 seconds, and 
click the Transport Loop button. This also turns on the Hiss Reduction dialog 
box’s Loop button.
7 Click the Hiss Reduction dialog box’s Play button. You’ll hear less noise.
8 You generally want to use the minimum acceptable amount of noise reduction 
to avoid altering the rest of the signal; reducing hiss may also reduce high 
frequencies. Move the Reduce by slider to the left and the hiss will return. Move 
it right to 100dB, and although there will be no hiss, the transients will lose 
some high frequencies.
9 Move the Reduce by slider to find a compromise setting between noise 
reduction and high-frequency response. For now, leave it at 10dB.
10 The Noise Floor slider tells Audition where to draw the line between the noise 
floor and the signal. As with the Reduce by slider, moving the slider farther 
to the left increases noise and farther to the right reduces noise and high-
frequency response. Leave it set to 10dB for now.
11 Revisit the Reduce by slider and move it to 20dB. The hiss is gone, but there’s a 
little less “snap” to the transients compared to the 10dB setting. You’ll need to 
decide which quality is more important to you, but for now choose 15dB as a 
compromise setting.
E Tip: You typically 
adjust the Reduce by 
parameter first to set the 
overall amount of noise 
reduction, and then 
adjust the Noise Floor 
parameter to determine 
the noise reduction 
characteristics. However, 
re-tweaking each slider 
can optimize the sound 
further. Also note that 
selecting Output Noise 
Only will play back only 
what’s being removed 
from the audio. This can 
help determine whether 
any desirable audio is 
being removed along 
with the hiss.

112 
Lesson 5 
Audio Restoration
12 Click the Transport Stop button. Turn off the Transport Loop button, click 
once within the Waveform Editor to deselect the loop, and then choose Edit > 
Select > Select All.
13 Click the Transport Play button. Enable and disable the Hiss Reduction dialog 
box’s Power State button to hear the file with and without noise reduction; the 
difference is significant, especially at the beginning and end where there’s no 
signal to mask the hiss. Stop playback.
14 Click the Hiss Reduction dialog box’s Close button.
15 If there’s no noise floor, Audition can still help remove noise. While still in the 
Waveform Editor, choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson05 folder, and open 
the file HissTruncated.wav.
16 Choose Effects > Noise Reduction/Restoration > Hiss Reduction (process).
17 Click the Transport Play button. Despite not capturing a noise print, you can 
verify that there’s less noise by clicking the Hiss Reduction dialog box’s Power 
State button to listen to the enabled and bypassed states.
18 Move the Reduce by slider to around 20dB, which is a typical amount for noise 
reduction. Now vary the Noise Floor slider for the best compromise between 
hiss reduction and high-frequency response; -2dB is a good choice.
19 Click the Hiss Reduction dialog box’s Power State button to listen to the enabled 
and bypassed states. Although the noise reduction doesn’t have quite the finesse 
obtainable by working with a noise print, it still makes a huge improvement 
without any significant audio degradation. 
20 Close the Hiss Reduction dialog box, and stop playback in preparation for the 
next lesson.
Reducing clicks
Clicks can consist of the little ticks and pops you hear with vinyl recordings, occa-
sional digital clocking errors in digital audio signals, a bad physical audio connec-
tion, and so on. Although it’s difficult to remove these completely without affecting 
the audio, Audition can help attenuate lower-level clicks and crackles.
1 With Audition open to the Waveform Editor, choose File > Open, navigate to 
the Lesson05 folder, and open the file Crackles.wav.
2 Click the Transport Loop and Play buttons, and you’ll hear clicks and crackles, 
especially during the quiet parts between drum hits in the beginning. 
3 Choose Effects > Noise Reduction/Restoration > Automatic Click Remover.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 113
4 The Threshold slider sets the sensitivity to clicks; lower values will “trap” more 
clicks but may also reduce lower-level transients you want to keep. Move the 
Threshold slider to 0; the processor will interpret almost anything as a click, 
so you’ll hear the program sputter as it tries to make an excessive number of 
real-time calculations. Conversely, a setting of 100 lets through too many clicks. 
Choose a setting of 20 to reduce most clicks while minimally affecting the audio. 
5 Complexity sets how complex a click Audition will process. Higher settings 
allow Audition to recognize more complex clicks but requires more 
computation and may degrade the audio somewhat. This is not a real-time 
control, so you need to adjust it, play the audio, adjust, play, and so on. For now, 
click the Transport Stop button, and then move the slider to 80.
6 Click the Transport Play button. Because this is a computation-intensive 
process, during real-time playback Audition may not be able to process a click 
prior to playing it back. The only way to be certain how processing will affect 
the sound is to click the Automatic Click Remover dialog box’s Apply button; 
click it now. Note that this closes the Automatic Click Remover processor.
7 Click the Transport Play button. Although the clicks are lower in volume, 
the removal process affects the audio, so we’ll try again. Choose Edit > Undo 
Automatic Click Remover. 
8 Choose Effects > Noise Reduction/Restoration > Automatic Click Remover; 
the settings will be as you left them. If Complexity is grayed out, click the 
Automatic Click Remover dialog box’s Play button and then the Stop button. 
Move the complexity slider to 35, and click Apply again.
9 Click the Transport Play button. The new setting produces better results than 
the original default value of 16 or the higher value you tried of 80. To compare 
the “repaired” sound with the original, choose Edit > Undo Automatic Click 
Remover, and then choose Edit > Redo Automatic Click Remover. Click the 
Transport Stop button when you’re done comparing the two.
P Note: There’s not 
a lot of difference 
between minor 
Complexity setting 
variations. For example, 
if you had chosen 40 
or 30 instead of 35, 
you probably wouldn’t 
notice any difference 
compared to a setting 
of 35.

114 
Lesson 5 
Audio Restoration
Reducing noise
Although you can reduce hiss with the Hiss Reduction effect, there are other types 
of noise you’ll want to reduce as well, like hum, air conditioning noise, and ventila-
tion sounds. If these sounds are relatively constant, Audition can reduce or remove 
them using the Noise Reduction process. This process can also reduce hiss and 
allow for more detailed editing compared to the Hiss Reduction option.
1 With Audition open to the Waveform Editor, choose File > Open, navigate to 
the Lesson05 folder, and open the file Hum.wav. 
2 Click the Transport Play button to hear the hum that was caused by a bad 
electrical connection (this kind of hum can also occur with unbalanced audio 
cables and high-gain circuits).
3 Select the first second of the audio file, which contains only hum. As with 
reducing hiss, Audition will take a noise print of the hum and subtract only this 
objectionable noise from the file.
4 Choose Effects > Noise Reduction/Restoration > Noise Reduction (process).
5 Click the Capture Noise Print button. A curve appears that shows the noise 
floor’s spectral distribution.
6 Select about the first 20 seconds of the file, and click the Transport Loop button 
if it is not already enabled. 
7 Click the Noise Reduction dialog box’s Play button. The hum will be gone 
during silent sections.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 115
8 You may hear a little hum immediately after a drum sound decays. The reason is 
that noise reduction doesn’t apply as much reduction when the sound is being 
masked and takes some time to return to full reduction when audio is no longer 
present. To remove more of the hum, move the Noise Reduction slider all the 
way to 100%.
9 The Reduce by slider sets the amount by which the noise will be reduced. 
A setting between 10 and 20dB is a good compromise between affecting the 
audio and reducing the noise. Set this slider to 15dB for now.
10 You’ll still hear a little hum after a drum sound decays. Click the Advanced 
disclosure triangle for more options.
11 The Spectral Decay Rate parameter determines how long it takes for the noise 
reduction to return to maximum when the audio goes from signal to silence. 
Reduce the Spectral Decay Rate to 20% to speed up the noise reduction 
response, thus eliminating the hum at the end of the drum sounds. 
12 Toggle the Noise Reduction dialog box’s Power State button, and you’ll hear 
the effectiveness of the noise reduction process. Close Audition without saving 
anything (click No to All) in preparation for the next lesson.
Removing artifacts
Sometimes particular sounds will need to be removed, like a cough in the middle 
of a live performance. Audition can do this using the Spectral Frequency Display, 
which allows for editing based on not just amplitude and time (as with the standard 
Waveform Editor), but also frequency. You can switch between these two displays 
by pressing Shift+D. This exercise shows you how to remove a cough in a perfor-
mance by classical harpsichordist Kathleen McIntosh.
1 Open Audition to the Waveform Editor, choose File > Open, navigate to the 
Lesson05 folder, and open the file Cough.wav.
2 Click the Transport Play button, and you’ll hear a cough in the background at 
around 1.65 seconds.
3 Choose View > Show Spectral Frequency Display. Because you’ll be doing 
detailed work, make the Waveform Editor window as large as possible by 
dragging the horizontal and vertical dividers.

116 
Lesson 5 
Audio Restoration
4 Zoom in and look closely at the spectrum at around 1.65 seconds. Unlike the 
linear bands of audio in various frequencies you see in the rest of the file, there’s 
something that looks almost like a “cloud”; that’s the cough.
5 Choose the rightmost button in the top toolbar (Spot Healing Brush tool), 
or type B to choose it. A circular cursor (that looks somewhat like a bandage 
icon) appears.
6 Upon selecting the Spot Healing Brush tool, a Size parameter appears next to 
the Spot Healing Brush tool’s toolbar button. Adjust the size so that the circular 
cursor is as wide as the cough.
P Note: The required 
Size parameter setting 
will vary depending on 
the Spectral Frequency 
Display’s zoom level.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 117
7 In one channel, drag the circular cursor over the area with the cough; the same 
area will be selected automatically in the other channel. The area over which 
you dragged with be “ghosted” in white. Be careful to drag over only the cough.
8 Release the mouse button, and then click the Transport Play button. The cough 
will be gone, and Audition will have “healed” (reconstructed) the audio behind 
the cough. (The healing process takes audio on either side of the deleted audio, 
and through a complex process of copying and crossfading, fills in the gap 
caused by removing the artifact.)
9 Close Audition without saving anything in preparation for the next lesson.
Alternate click removal
You can use the Spectral Frequency Display to remove clicks. Although this is 
a manual process that is more time-consuming than using the Automatic Click 
Remover effect, the removal process will be more accurate and have less impact on 
the audio quality. 
1 Open Audition to the Waveform Editor, choose Edit > File > Open, navigate to 
the Lesson05 folder, and open the file Crackles.wav. 
2 Because you had the Spectral Frequency Display open in the previous lesson, 
Audition should open with the Spectral Frequency Display visible. If not, 
choose View > Show Spectral Frequency Display (or press Shift+D).
E Tip: To drag in 
a straight line, hold 
down the computer 
keyboard’s Shift key 
while dragging.
E Tip: If you don’t 
remove all of an artifact 
with this process, you 
can try multiple times, 
or even use this process 
on successive, small 
selections of an artifact.

Lesson 5 
Audio Restoration
3 Zoom in until you can see the clicks toward the file’s beginning as thin, solid 
vertical lines (outlined in white in the screen shot for clarity).
4 Type B to choose the Spot Healing Brush tool, and set its pixel size to the same 
width as a click.
5 Hold down the Shift key, and then click at the top of the click (noise) and drag 
down. This selects the noise in both channels.
6 Release the mouse button; the click will be gone and the audio behind it 
“healed.” Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each click you want to remove.
7 Return the playhead to the beginning of the file if necessary, and then click the 
Transport Play button. The file sounds as if the clicks had never been there.
8 Keep Audition open in preparation for the next lesson.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 119
Creative removal
Audition’s restoration tools aren’t just for fixing problems; you can also use them 
in creative ways and for sound design. This lesson takes a drum loop and uses the 
Spectral Frequency Display to remove four drum hits.
1 With Audition open to the Waveform Editor, choose File > Open, navigate to 
the Lesson05 folder, and open the file DrumLoop.wav. 
2 Click the Transport Play button. Note that there are four white noise “hits” at 
about 0.47, 1.45, 2.39, and 3.35 seconds. We’ll remove them.
3 As with the previous lessons, zoom in until the hit you want to remove is big 
enough so it’s easy to define.
4 Because we want to remove the audio completely, not “heal” it in the context of 
other audio, choose the Marquee Selection tool from the Waveform Editor’s top 
toolbar, or type E.
5 Draw a rectangle around the first drum hit.
6 Choose Effects > Amplitude and Compression > Amplify. Move both Gain 
sliders full left, and click Apply.
7 Locate the second hit, and again draw a rectangle around it, but this time don’t 
include the yellow section at the bottom of the hit, because that represents the 
kick drum sound. 
8 Choose Effects > Amplitude and Compression > Amplify. With both Gain 
sliders full left, click Apply.
9 Draw a rectangle around the third drum hit, as you did in step 5.
10 Choose Effects > Amplitude and Compression > Amplify. With both Gain 
sliders full left, click Apply.

120 
Lesson 5 
Audio Restoration
11 Locate the fourth hit, and again draw a rectangle around it, but as in step 7 
don’t include the yellow section at the bottom of the hit, which is the kick 
drum sound.
12 Choose Effects > Amplitude and Compression > Amplify. With both Gain 
sliders full left, click Apply.
13 Click in the Waveform Editor outside of the area you selected to deselect it. 
Return the playhead to the file’s beginning, and then click the Transport Play 
button. Most of the sound from the hits is gone, but you can still hear a little bit 
of noise on the second and fourth hits.
14 Choose the Lasso Selection tool from the Waveform Editor’s upper toolbar, 
or type D.
15 Go to the second hit, and carefully draw a lasso around the red/violet part of the 
waveform that sits above the yellow kick drum audio.
16 Choose Edit > Cut, or press the Delete key.
17 Go to the fourth hit, and carefully draw a lasso around the violet part of the 
waveform that sits above the yellow kick drum audio. Then choose Edit > Cut, 
or press the Delete key.
18 Click the Transport Play button. The drum loop is the same as the original but 
without the four hits. 
P Note: The technique of drawing a lasso around artifacts can remove sounds like finger squeaks 
on guitar strings, clicks or pops, breathing while a person plays an instrument, and many other 
artifacts. It takes experience to recognize what’s an artifact and what’s part of the sound, and also 
whether to choose the Spot Healing Brush tool and drag across the sound or choose the Lasso tool 
and either cut or reduce the artifact level. However, with sufficient practice, this type of restoration 
is extremely effective.

Review questions
1 Which is more effective, automatic or manual click removal?
2 What is a “noise print”?
3 Is noise reduction good only for removing hiss?
4 What does “healing” do?
5 Are Audition’s restoration tools amazing, or what? Name two ways other than 
restoration where these tools can be useful. 
Review answers
1 Automatic click removal is faster, but manual click removal can be more effective.
2 It’s like a “fingerprint” that represents the specific sonic character of a section of noise. 
Subtracting this from the audio file removes the noise.
3 Noise reduction can minimize or even remove any constant background sound, as long 
as there’s an isolated section where you can capture a noise print.
4 “Healing” replaces audio removed by the Spot Healing Brush tool with crossfaded, 
“good” audio from either side of the artifact.
5 Indeed they are; not only can you use them for fixing audio problems, but you can even 
use them in highly creative ways, like removing specific drum hits from drum loops or 
doing sound design.

122
Mastering
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Use effects to improve the sound of a mixed, stereo piece of music
• Apply EQ to reduce “mud,” emphasize the kick drum, and make 
cymbals more articulated
• Apply dynamics to give music more apparent level, which can also 
help overcome background noise in cars and other environments
• Create ambience for music that has a “dry,” sterile sound
• Alter stereo imaging to create a wider stereo effect
• Make small edits to emphasize particular parts of a piece of music
This lesson takes about 45 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve cop-
ied the Lesson06 folder that contains the audio examples into the Lessons 
folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. Remember 
that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, because you 
can always return to the original versions by copying them from the 
Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

123
Mastering is the stage between mixing and distribu-
tion. By tasteful application of EQ, dynamics, wave-
form editing, widening, and other techniques, you can 
shape a piece of music into a refined audio experience 
that’s ready for distribution or posting online.

124 
Lesson 6 
Mastering
Mastering basics
Mastering is the process that occurs after mixing but before distribution. It’s where 
you add any final edits or enhancements (equalization, dynamics, fade in or out, 
etc.) to a stereo or surround mixed file. With album projects (whether a CD or 
collection of music posted online), mastering also involves determining the correct 
order of the songs in the album (“sequencing” the songs) and matching their levels 
and timbres for a cohesive listening experience. 
As the final link in the music production chain, mastering can make or break a 
project. As a result, people often hand off projects to veteran mastering engineers, 
not just for their technical expertise, but to enlist a fresh, objective set of ears.
However, if your goal with mastering is simply to make a good mix better, Audition 
provides the tools required for professional-level mastering. The more you work 
with mastering, the more your skills will improve. But it can’t be emphasized 
enough that the most important mastering tool is a good set of ears that can 
analyze where a piece of music is deficient, coupled with the technical expertise of 
knowing what processing will compensate for those deficiencies.
In addition, remember that ideally the purpose of mastering is not to salvage a 
recording, but to enhance an already superb mix. If there’s a problem with the mix, 
remix the tune; don’t count on mastering to solve the problem.
In Lesson 4, “Signal Processing,” you learned how to do basic mastering with the 
mastering suite of effects in the Special menu. This lesson takes a more “component” 
approach by using individual effects, which are presented in the order in which 
you would typically apply these effects (equalization, dynamics, ambience, stereo 
imaging), and waveform “touchup.” Note that sometimes touching up the waveform 
occurs first if there are known problems that need to be fixed, such as a portion of 
the track is too quiet and needs to be raised in level with the Amplify effect.
step 1: equalization
Usually, the first step of mastering involves adjusting equalization to create a pleas-
ing tonal balance.
1 With Audition open to the Waveform Editor, choose File > Open, navigate to 
the Lesson06 folder, and open the file KeepTheFunk.wav.
2 In the Effects Rack, click insert 1’s right arrow and choose Filter and EQ > 
Parametric Equalizer.
3 If necessary, choose the Default preset from the Presets drop-down menu, and 
then select the 30dB Range radio button in the lower-right corner.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 125
4 Click the Transport Play button and listen. The music sounds a little “muddy” 
in the low frequencies and lacks crispness in the highs. Loop the file by 
clicking the Transport’s loop button so it keeps playing while you make the 
following adjustments.
5 One way to identify problem areas is to boost a parametric stage’s Gain, sweep 
its Frequency, and listen to whether any frequencies jump out as excessive. So, 
click the Band 2 box, drag it all way up to +15dB, and drag the box left and 
right. Note that the sound is “tubby” around 150Hz.
6 Drag the Band 2 box down to around -5dB at around 150Hz. Note how this 
tightens up the low end. The difference is subtle, but often mastering is about 
the cumulative effect of multiple subtle changes.
7 The kick drum seems like it should be stronger and have more of a deep “thud” 
for this kind of music; use Band 1 to dial in the drum’s frequency and add a 
narrow boost. Set Band 1’s Q to 8, and drag the Band 1 box up to +15dB. Sweep 
the Frequency back and forth between 20 and 100Hz, and note that the kick 
really stands out around 45Hz.
8 Bring the Band 1 level back down to around 5-6dB so the kick isn’t too prominent.
9 The hi-hat and cymbals seem kind of dull, but increasing the high-frequency 
response can improve that. Set Band 4’s Q to 1.5, set Frequency to 8kHz, and 
drag the Band 4 box up to around +2dB.
10 Toggle the power state button again for comparison. Note that in the screen 
shot, unused bands have been turned off for clarity. Keep Audition open for the 
next lesson.

126 
Lesson 6 
Mastering
step 2: dynamics
Dynamics processing can make a piece of music “jump out” of the speakers because 
it acquires more punch and makes low-level sounds louder. This can also help the 
music overcome background noises found in many different listening environ-
ments. To avoid listener fatigue, you don’t want to add too much processing and kill 
the dynamics, but some processing can produce a nice, lively lift.
This lesson uses the Multiband Compressor to control dynamics. In addition to 
offering compression in four frequency bands, there’s an overall output limiter.
1 In the Effects Rack, click insert 4’s right arrow and choose Amplitude and 
Compression > Multiband Compressor. (The reason for choosing insert 4 is 
because you’ll want to add some effects later between the EQ and dynamics.)
2 Choose the Pop Master preset from the Presets menu to give the music much
more apparent loudness.
3 If you listen for a while, you’ll hear that the dynamics have been reduced 
dramatically—in fact, too much. To restore some dynamics, set each band’s 
Threshold parameter to -18.0dB. 
4 Click in the limiter’s Threshold field and drag down to -20dB. The sound 
becomes overly limited, squashed, and uneven. Now drag up to 0. No limiting is 
being applied, and the sound lacks “punch.” Drag down to a good compromise 
setting between these two extremes, like -8.0dB.
5 Toggle the Effects Rack’s power state to compare the sound with and without 
the EQ and Multiband Compressor. The processed sound is fuller, tighter, more 
distinct, and louder. Also note that the Multiband Dynamics has emphasized 
the EQ changes made previously.
P Note: Dynamics 
is usually the last 
processor in a mastering 
chain because it sets 
the maximum allowable 
level. Adding effects 
afterward could 
increase or decrease 
the overall level.
P Note: The meters 
to the immediate 
right of each band’s 
Threshold slider (whose 
position follows the 
numeric Threshold field) 
indicate the amount 
of compression. The 
further down the red 
”virtual LED” goes, the 
more compression is 
being applied.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 127
step 3: ambience
Although reverb is seldom added during mastering, the music seems a little “dry.” 
So, you’ll add some ambience to give the illusion of the music being played in an 
acoustic space.
1 In the Effects Rack, click insert 2’s right arrow and choose Reverb > Studio Reverb.
2 Choose the Room Ambience 1 preset from the Presets menu. You’ll need to stop 
the Transport to choose a preset. After choosing the preset, click the Transport 
Play button.
3 Set the Dry slider to 0 and the Wet slider to 40% so it’s easy to hear the results of 
any edits.
4 Set Decay to 500ms, Early Reflections to 20%, Width to 100, High Frequency 
Cut to 6000Hz, Low Frequency Cut to 100Hz, and both Damping and Diffusion 
to 100%.
5 Adjust the blend of Dry and Wet signals. Set Dry to 90% and Wet to 50%.
6 Toggle the Reverb’s power state; you won’t hear much difference unless you 
listen very carefully, because this adds just a tiny bit of “spice.” The added 
ambience is most noticeable when the drums hit by themselves.
step 4: stereo imaging
As with reverb, stereo imaging isn’t added often, but it’s appropriate for this particu-
lar lesson. Stereo imaging stretches the stereo image so the left channel moves more 
to the left, and the right channel moves more to the right. In this lesson, increasing 
the stereo image helps separate the two guitars in the opposite channels even more.
1 In the Effects Rack, click insert 3’s right arrow and choose Special > Mastering. 
Only the Widener will be used.
E Tip: With albums 
that contain tracks 
recorded at different 
times or in different 
studios, sometimes 
adding a subtle overall 
ambience produces a 
more cohesive feeling.
P Note: The Studio 
Reverb trades off sound 
quality for real-time 
adjustment. For critical 
applications, one of 
the other reverbs is 
preferable, but for 
learning how reverb 
affects the sound, the 
Studio Reverb is a 
better choice due to its 
immediacy in changing 
settings.

128 
Lesson 6 
Mastering
2 If necessary, choose the Default preset from the Presets menu. 
3 Set the Widener slider to 85%.
4 Toggle the Effects Rack’s power state to compare the sound with and without 
the various mastering processors—the results speak for themselves. Also, try 
turning the power state on and off for the individual processors to hear each 
processor’s overall contribution to the sound.
step 5: “push” the drum hits; 
then apply the changes
Four drum hits happen between 23.25 and 24 seconds. You’ll boost them just a bit 
to give them more emphasis. 
1 Click the Transport Stop button. Select the four hits (zoom in if necessary) and 
add +3.9dB of gain with the HUD (heads-up display).
2 Play the file to hear the result of boosting these four drum hits.
3 You’ll apply all these effects to make them a permanent part of the file, which 
will also redraw the waveform to show the changes caused by mastering. In the 
Effects Rack, choose Entire File from the Process drop-down menu.
4 Click Apply. Audition applies the result of all the effects to the file and removes 
the effects from the Effects Rack.
P Note: Making edits 
to the waveform can be 
done prior to adding 
effects or after adding 
effects if a particular 
issue doesn’t become 
obvious until after 
you’ve applied effects 
that change the overall 
sound in a subtle, or 
even dramatic, way.
P Note: The Apply 
function resets all 
effects to their default 
value. If you don’t like 
the results of using 
Apply, choose Edit > 
Undo to restore the 
effects and the settings 
you edited. 
P Note: It can take 
years to become good 
at the art and science 
of mastering, especially 
if the file has problems 
that need to be fixed. 
Nonetheless, most 
mastering simply 
revolves around 
EQ, dynamics, and 
some selected other 
processors.

review questions
1 At what stage of the music production process does mastering occur?
2 Is mastering only about optimizing individual tracks?
3 What are the most essential processors used in mastering?
4 Is adding ambience recommended when mastering?
5 What is the main disadvantage of excessive dynamics compression? 
review answers
1 Mastering occurs after mixing but before music distribution.
2 With album projects, mastering also sequences the songs in the correct order and aims 
for sonic consistency from track to track.
3 Typically, EQ and dynamics processors are the main effects used in the mastering process.
4 No. Normally ambience is added during the mixing process but can sometimes 
improve the sound when added while mastering.
5 The main disadvantage is a lack of dynamics, which can lead to listener fatigue because 
there are no significant variations between loud and soft passages.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Apply extreme processing to everyday sounds
• Create special effects 
• Change the environments in which sounds occur
• Use pitch shifting and filtering to alter sounds 
• Use the Doppler Effect to add motion
This lesson takes approximately 45 minutes to complete. This assumes 
you’ve copied the Lesson07 folder that contains the audio examples into 
the Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

131
With Audition’s array of signal processors, it’s possible 
to modify common, everyday sounds into something 
completely different—like transforming a wall fan 
into a spaceship’s engine room or a running faucet 
into crickets at night.

132 
Lesson 7 
sound Design
About sound design
Sound design is the process of capturing, recording, and/or manipulating the audio 
elements used in movies, television, video games, museum installations, theater, 
postproduction, and other art forms that require sound. Sound design can refer 
to music, but this lesson emphasizes sound effects and ambience. These types of 
sounds are also common in sonic logos (like the sound you hear to identify Intel 
Inside or NBC) or the sounds layered in movie scenes to create a particular mood.
For example, a scene in a science-fiction movie might have the characters in a 
spaceship’s engine room where the drone of the engine provides a suspenseful 
backdrop as the protagonists search for the cause of a radiation leak. Occasionally, 
against this engine sound backdrop, sudden, sharp sounds might appear to indicate 
a new leak breaking through the engine wall. Of course, no one is in space record-
ing these sounds; it’s up to the sound designer to create appropriate effects.
Sound effects libraries are available from several companies, but a sound designer 
will often modify these or record sounds using a field recorder. For example, in the 
beginning of the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, a giant boulder rolls toward Indiana 
Jones. The sound of the rolling boulder was created by taping a microphone to the 
rear bumper of a Honda and recording the sound of the car backing down a gravel 
driveway. Subsequent sound design work turned this into a huge, ominous sound. 
Another example involves the TIE fighters in Star Wars: The sound of them diving 
is a modified elephant cry.
Two files were recorded for the following lessons using a portable digital recorder: 
water running into a sink from a faucet and a wall fan. You’ll learn how to turn 
these sounds into a variety of sound effects and ambience.
Creating rain sounds
With sound design, it helps to start with a sound in the same genre. To create rain, 
the running water would most likely produce a better end result than the recording 
of the fan. 
1  Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson07 folder, and open the file 
RunningWater.wav.
2  Click the Transport Loop button so the water sound plays back 
continuously. Click the Transport Play button to audition the loop.
3  You’ll first change this sound to a light, spring rain. Click the Effects Rack tab, 
and drag the panel’s lower splitter bar downward to extend the panel to its full 
height because you’ll be using several effects.

ADobe AuDition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 133
4 Click Effects Rack insert 1’s right arrow button and choose Filter and EQ > 
Graphic Equalizer (10 Bands). Ensure that Range is 48dB and Master Gain is 0.
5 Pull the sliders for all bands other than 4k and 8k all the way down to -24dB.
6 Bring the 4k sand 8k sliders down to -10dB.
7 Toggle the effect’s power state on and off a few times to compare how the EQ 
has changed the overall sound. With the EQ power on, you now have a light 
spring rain. You might find the effect more realistic if you bring the 8k slider 
down to -15dB.
8 Suppose you wanted to do sound design for a scene where the character is 
inside a house, and it is raining outside. In this case there would be fewer high 
frequencies due to the house walls and windows blocking the highs. Pull the 8k 
slider down all the way, and the rain sounds more like it’s outside.
9 To surround the character with rain if the character, say, opens the door, leaves 
the house, and is in the middle of the rain, click insert 2’s right arrow button 
and choose Delay and Echo > Delay.
10 The Default patch spreads out the sound, but it’s too separated: Rain wouldn’t 
fall only to the character’s right and left, but all around. Change both Mix 
controls to 50% so there’s a convincing panorama of rain.
11 It’s important that the delay not create any kind of rhythm. Set the Left Channel 
Delay Time to around 420ms and the Right Channel Delay Time to 500ms. 
These delays are long enough that you won’t perceive a rhythm.
12 If the character then goes outside again, return to the Graphic Equalizer 
window by double-clicking its insert in the Effects Rack, and increase the 8kHz 
slider to around -14kHz. Keep this project open as you move to the next lesson.

134 
Lesson 7 
sound Design
Creating a babbling brook
Changing the scene from rain to a babbling brook in the distance simply involves 
removing the delay and changing the EQ setting.
1 Click the Delay insert’s arrow, and choose Remove Effect. A babbling brook has 
a more distinct sound than sheets of rain, so you don’t need the additional “rain 
drops” created by the Delay.
2 Click on the Graphic Equalizer’s window to select it. Set Range to 120dB and 
Master Gain to 0dB.
3 Set the Graphic Equalizer sliders as follows: <31, 63, 8k, and >16k all to -60dB. 
Set 125 and 250 to 0, 500 to -10, 1k to -20, 2k to -30, and 4k to -40. 
4 The babbling brook is now in the distance. As the character moves closer to the 
brook, increase 2k to -20 and 4k to -30. Now the brook sounds closer. Keep this 
project open as you move on to the next lesson.
Creating insects at night
It’s even possible to use the running water to create a nighttime insect/crickets 
sound. This lesson demonstrates how signal processing can turn one sound into 
something completely different.
1 Double-click in the Waveform Editor to select the entire waveform.
2 From the Effects menu near the top of the window, choose Time and Pitch > 
Stretch and Pitch (process).
3 In the Stretch and Pitch window, select the Default preset if it is not 
already selected.

ADobe AuDition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 135
4 Move the Pitch Shift slider all the way to the left (-36 semitones), and then click 
OK. It will take several seconds for processing to occur.
5 Click on the Graphic Equalizer window to select it. With Range still at 120dB, 
move all sliders to -60dB except set 4k to 10dB. Click the Transport Play button 
to hear the processed sound.
6 You can smooth out the sound and make it sound a little more distant by adding 
reverb. In the Effects Rack’s insert 3, click the right arrow button and choose 
Reverb > Studio Reverb. Stop playback by clicking the Transport Stop button so 
you can select a reverb preset.
7 Click the Presets drop-down menu and choose Great Hall.
8 Click the Transport Play button, and listen to your refined insects at night sound.
Creating an alien choir
For the last effect using the running water sound, you’ll create a totally abstract 
sound that’s ethereal and quite evocative.
1 If the entire waveform isn’t already selected, double-click in the Waveform Editor.
2 Choose Effects > Time and Pitch > Stretch and Pitch (process). The settings 
should be the same as they were previously, but if not, choose the preset Default 
from the drop-down menu.
3 If needed, move the Pitch Shift slider all the way to the left (-36 semitones), and 
then click OK. It will take several seconds for processing to occur.
4 Make an audio selection that excludes the first and last two seconds, and then 
choose Edit > Crop.
5 The level will be very low, so let’s bring it up. With the waveform still selected, 
choose Effects >Amplitude and Compression > Normalize (process). 
6 Select Normalize To and enter 50%. Normalize All Channels Equally should 
also be selected. Click OK.
7 Bypass the Graphic Equalizer. The Reverb should still have the Great Hall preset 
selected. Move the Decay, Width, Diffusion, and Wet sliders all the way to the 
right. Move the Dry slider all the way to the left. When you click the Transport 
Play button, you should now hear an ethereal, animated pad.
8 Now add some animation for the final touch. In an Effects Rack’s insert after the 
Studio Reverb, click the insert’s right arrow and choose Delay and Echo > Echo. 
Select the preset Spooky.
P Note: Extreme 
pitch shifting can add 
anomalies, like volume 
spikes or clicks, at the 
file’s beginning and end. 
If so, make an audio 
selection that excludes 
the first and last two 
seconds, and then 
choose Edit > Crop. 
Extreme shifting may 
also lower the volume, 
so you might want to 
increase the Effects 
Rack’s Output control.

136 
Lesson 7 
sound Design
9 In an Effects Rack’s insert after the Echo, click the insert’s right arrow and 
choose Modulation > Chorus. Select the preset 10 Voices. You may need to turn 
down the Effects Rack’s Output control to avoid clipping. Note how extensive 
pitch stretching coupled with effects from the Studio Reverb, Echo, and Chorus 
can turn running water into an alien soundscape.
Creating sci-fi machine effects
Just as you used running water to generate water-based effects, the fan sound makes 
a good basis for machine and mechanical sounds. This lesson describes how to turn 
an ordinary wall fan sound into a variety of science-fiction, spaceship sound effects.
1 If Audition is open, close it without saving to start fresh. Open the program, 
choose File > Open, navigate to the Lesson07 folder, and open the file Fan.wav. 
Click the Transport Play button to hear what the file sounds like.
2 Double-click inside the Waveform Editor to select the entire waveform.
3 Choose Effects > Time and Pitch > Stretch and Pitch (process).
4 Select the preset Default if it is not already selected.
5 Set the Pitch Shift slider to -24 semitones. Lowering the pitch makes the engine 
sound “bigger,” but lowering beyond -24 semitones makes the sound indistinct. 
Click OK; processing will take a few seconds.
6 As in the previous lessons, for the smoothest sound, make an audio selection 
that excludes the first and last two seconds, and then choose Edit > Crop.

7 Click the Effects Rack insert 1’s right arrow button and choose Special > 
Guitar Suite. From the Presets drop-down menu, choose Drum Suite. Click the 
Transport Play button, and note how the sound becomes more metallic and 
machine-like.
8 Click the Effects Rack insert 2’s right arrow button and choose Filter and EQ > 
Parametric Equalizer. If the preset Default is not already selected, choose it 
from the Presets drop-down menu.
9 Deselect bands 1–5 to leave only the L (low) and H (high) bands active.
10 Click the L and H Q/Width button to select the steepest (the button’s center line 
is most vertical) slope.
11 If the file isn’t already playing, click the Transport Play button. Pull the H box all 
the way down and left to around 3kHz.
12 Pull the L box up to 20 and right to about 300Hz.
13 Add some character to the engine with a resonant peak that increases the level in 
a narrow band of frequencies. Click the Band 2 button to enable that parametric 
stage. Edit Frequency to 500Hz, Gain to 10dB, and Q/Width to around 20. The 
Guitar Suite and Parametric EQ effects provide the main engine sound.

Lesson 7 
sound Design
14 Now let’s travel to a different section of the virtual spaceship, away from the 
main hum of the machine room but where you can still hear the engine rumble. 
Click the Effects Rack insert 3’s right arrow button, and choose Reverb > 
Studio Reverb.
15 Click the Transport Stop button to change the Studio Reverb preset, and then 
choose Great Hall from the Presets drop-down menu.
16 You’ll now add lots of reverb but only to the low frequencies to emphasize the 
rumble. Set the Decay, Width, Diffusion, and Wet sliders all the way to the right. 
Set the High Frequency Cut slider to 200Hz, the Low Frequency Cut slider full 
left, and the Dry slider full left. Click the Transport Play button.
17 Bypass the Studio Reverb to return to the engine room sound, or enable it to 
move farther away to a different part of the spaceship. Leave this project open 
in preparation for the next lesson.
Creating an alien drone flyby
In addition to creating static sound effects, Audition includes a Doppler Shifter 
processor that imparts motion—from left to right, around in circles, tracing an arc, 
and so on. In this lesson you’ll take advantage of the Doppler Shifter processor to 
“animate” the sound of an alien drone.
1 If the waveform isn’t already selected, double-click within the Waveform Editor 
to select the entire waveform.
2 Choose Effects > Time and Pitch > Stretch and Pitch (process). 
3 Choose the preset Default from the Presets menu. Set the Stretch slider to 200%. 
Click OK; processing will take a few seconds.

ADobe AuDition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 139
4 Either bypass the Parametric Equalizer effect, or click its insert’s arrow and 
choose Remove Effect.
5 Either bypass the Studio Reverb effect, or click its insert’s arrow and choose 
Remove Effect.
6 If the Guitar Suite window isn’t open already, double-click its insert in the Effects 
Rack. Choose the preset Lowest Fidelity from the Presets drop-down menu.
7 With the entire waveform still selected, choose Effects > Special > Doppler 
Shifter (process). 
8 Choose the preset Whizzing by From Left to Right from the Doppler Shifter’s 
Presets drop-down menu, and then click OK. Click the Transport Play button to 
hear the drone fly by from left to right.
9 Because the sound is most effective if it fades up from nothing and fades out 
to nothing, in the Waveform Editor click the Fade In button in the upper-left 
corner, and drag it to the right about two seconds.
10 Similarly, click the Fade Out button in the Waveform Editor’s upper right, and 
drag it left to about eight seconds.
11 To enhance the Doppler Shifter effect, click an Effects Rack insert’s right arrow 
and choose Modulation > Flanger.
12 In the Flanger window, choose the preset Heavy Flange from the Presets drop-
down menu.
13 Click on the Modulation Rate parameter, type 0.1, and then press Enter. Using 
the slider would make it almost impossible to choose this precise a value.
14 Click the Transport Play button, and the alien drone will sound even more 
realistic as it flies by from left to right.

Review questions
1 What is sound design?
2 What effects can provide spatial placement within Audition?
3 What artifacts can extreme pitch shifting add?
4 Is the Guitar Suite useful only for guitar effects?
5 Do you need to use commercial sound libraries to create sound effects? 
Review answers
1 Sound design is the process of capturing, recording, and/or manipulating the audio 
elements used in movies, television, video games, museum installations, theater, 
postproduction, and other art forms that require sound.
2 EQ, reverb, delay/echo, and the Doppler Shifter can all contribute to placing a sound in 
the stereo or surround field.
3 Extreme pitch shifting may cause unpredictable amplitude spikes at the beginning and/
or end of the file, as well as lower the file’s overall level.
4 The Guitar Suite offers huge possibilities for sound design; this lesson has tapped only 
a bit of its potential.
5 Not always. Because of Audition’s rich selection of signal processors, ordinary sounds 
can be transformed into entirely different sounds.

Creating and 
reCording Files 
lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
•
Record into the Waveform Editor
•
Record into the Multitrack Editor
•
Drag and drop files into the Multitrack Editor
•
Import tracks from CDs into the Waveform Editor 
•
Create custom templates for the Multitrack Editor
This lesson takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. This assumes 
you’ve copied the Lesson08 folder that contains the audio examples into 
the Lessons folder you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

143
Not only can you record audio into Audition’s 
Waveform Editor or Multitrack Editor, you can also 
extract audio from standard Red Book Compact Discs 
or drag files from the desktop directly into either 
Audition Editor.

144 
Lesson 8 
Creating and Recording Files
recording into the Waveform editor
Lesson 1, “Audio Interfacing,” covered audio interfaces and how to map the inter-
face’s physical inputs and outputs to Audition’s virtual inputs and outputs. This 
lesson covers how to record and import audio into Audition, as well as how to 
extract audio from CDs. If necessary, review Lesson 1 to make sure you understand 
the principles behind interfacing. This lesson assumes you know how to map inputs 
and outputs. You’ll start by recording audio into the Waveform Editor. 
1 Connect a microphone, guitar, portable music player output, cell phone audio 
output, or other signal source into a compatible audio interface input or internal 
audio input on your computer.
2 Adjust the interface’s Input level control for an appropriate signal level. The 
interface will have either a physical meter or dedicated control panel software that 
monitors the inputs and outputs, and displays signal strength. You’ll need to rely 
on the interface’s meters when setting levels because Audition’s Waveform Editor 
indicates levels only when recording or paused, not when stopped.
3 Open Audition. Choose File > New > Audio File.
4 A dialog box appears with an editable File Name field, and three fields with 
drop-down menus. Enter the File Name RecordNarration.
5 Audition defaults to a 48000Hz sample rate, which is standard for video. 
However, for this lesson choose 44100Hz—the standard for CD audio—as the 
sample rate from the drop-down menu. The most common choices for sample 
rates include:
P Note: You will 
need an audio CD to do 
one of these lessons.
P Note: The optimum 
input level should never 
go into the red on a level 
meter. Today’s digital 
recording technology 
allows for sufficient 
headroom, so it’s not 
necessary to have the 
highest levels possible. 
Also, once you’ve 
recorded in Audition, 
you can use the Amplify 
or Normalize effects to 
bring up the level as 
needed.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 145
•
44100Hz is the same rate used for CDs and is the most “universal” sample 
rate for audio.
•
48000Hz is the standard choice for video projects. 
•
32000Hz is common in broadcast and satellite transmissions.
•
22050Hz was a popular choice for games and low-resolution digital audio. 
Sample rates lower than 22050Hz are of very low fidelity and are generally 
used for speech, dictation, toys, and so on.
•
Sample rates above 48000 are rarely used, although some studios record at 
88200 or 96000, believing that it has the potential to improve sound quality 
or provides a better archival medium. Most studies show that few people 
can accurately tell the difference between 44100 and 48000 or higher sample 
rates. Higher sample rates also require more storage space; that is, a one-
minute 96kHz file will require twice the space as the same file at 48kHz.
6 Choose the desired number of channels from the Channels drop-down menu. For 
a mic or electric guitar, choose Mono. For a portable music player or other stereo 
signal source, choose Stereo. The option 5.1 is for recording in surround sound.
7 Choose 24 bits from the Bit Depth drop-down menu. Here is a list of the choices 
and their descriptions:
•
8 bits is low resolution and is not used for professional audio. It’s common 
for games and consumer devices.
•
16 bits is the resolution for CDs and offers industry-standard audio quality.
•
24 bits is preferred by most recording engineers because it provides more 
headroom, and setting levels is less critical because there is greater dynamic 
range. Files that are 24-bits take up 50 percent more space than 16-bit files, 
but given the low cost of hard disk storage, this is an acceptable trade-off.
•
32 (float) results in the highest resolution but offers no significant advantage 
over 24-bit files. They take up more space, and many programs are not 
compatible with 32-bit float files.
8 After making the selections in steps 4–7, click OK.
9 Assuming you’re using an external audio interface, choose Edit > Preferences 
(Audition > Preferences) > Audio Hardware. Verify that the correct Device 
Class, I/O Buffer size, and Sample Rate are selected. For Windows users, also 
verify that the Device Class and Device settings are correct. Click OK.
10 To see levels in Audition while recording, choose Window > Level Meters if the 
meters are not already in your workspace. Dock the meters horizontally along 
the bottom of your workspace for the best meter resolution.

Lesson 8 
Creating and Recording Files
11 Click the Transport’s red Record button. Recording begins immediately. Speak 
into the mic or play back whatever sound source connects to your interface. 
You’ll see the waveform being drawn in the Waveform Editor in real time, and 
the meters will reflect the current input signal level.
12 Click the Transport Pause button. Recording will pause, but the meters will 
still show the incoming signal level. 
13 To resume recording, click the Pause button or Record button.
14 Click the Stop button to stop recording. The waveform you recorded will 
be selected.
15 Click somewhere in the middle of the Waveform Editor (i.e., where you’ve 
already recorded something), and then click the Record button to record over 
the previously recorded material. 
16 Record for a few seconds, and click Stop. The audio between where you started 
and stopped recording will be selected.
17 Leave Audition open and your signal source and interface set up in preparation 
for the next lesson.
E Tip: Being able to 
record over previously 
recorded material can 
speed up the recording 
of narration. If you 
make a mistake in a 
particular line, click at 
the beginning of the 
line and re-record it.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 147
recording into the Multitrack editor
Audition not only integrates the Waveform Editor and Multitrack Editor, but can 
transfer files easily between the two. This lesson shows you how to record into 
the Multitrack Editor, explains how to transfer your recording into the Waveform 
Editor for editing, and then describes how to return it to the Multitrack Editor. 
1 Choose File > New > Multitrack Session.
A dialog box appears with fields for an editable File Name, Folder Location for 
storing the project, and project Template. The dialog box also includes Sample 
Rate and Bit Depth fields identical to those in the New Audio File dialog box, 
and a Master field that determines whether the output is Mono, Stereo, or a 
surround format (if supported by your interface). 
2 Enter the Session Name MultitrackRecording.
3 The default folder location for saving projects is within the User’s Documents 
folder (Windows or Mac). For this tutorial, accept the default folder.
4 Choose the 24 Track Music Session template. Later in this lesson we’ll cover 
how you can create your own templates.
5 Click OK. The Multitrack Editor opens. 
6 Each track has an Input field; an arrow to its left points right toward the input 
field. For Track 1, choose the interface input to which your signal source connects 
from the Input field’s drop-down menu. A track can be stereo or mono. 
E Tip: It’s good 
practice to have a 
separate, high-speed 
(at least 7200 rpm) 
drive with a dedicated 
folder for storing your 
projects. This separates 
streaming audio on 
the audio drive from 
program operations on 
your main drive. Also, 
backing up the audio 
drive backs up all of 
your projects.
P Note: Sample 
Rate, Bit Depth, and 
the Master output 
are stored with the 
Template, so once 
you’ve chosen a 
template, these options 
are grayed out. If you 
want to edit these 
settings, select None 
for Template.
P Note: If the Input 
field is not visible, 
click the double-arrow 
button in the upper 
left of the Multitrack 
Editor’s toolbar.

Lesson 8 
Creating and Recording Files
7 As soon as you select an input, a track’s R button becomes available to Arm 
For Record (arming means the track is ready to record as soon as you click the 
Transport’s Record button). Click the R button and talk into the mic; note that 
the track’s meter indicates the incoming level.
8 Click the Transport Record button to begin recording. Record your signal 
source for at least 15–20 seconds. As when recording in the Waveform Editor, 
you can pause and resume recording by clicking the Pause button. After you’ve 
finished recording, click the Transport Stop button.
9 Place the playhead around 5 seconds into the file.
10 Click the Transport Record button, and record for about 5 seconds or so. 
Then click Stop.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 149
11 Click on the track where you just recorded (i.e., between the 5- and 10-second 
marks). Notice that there is a separate layer recorded on top of the previously 
recorded track. By clicking on it, you can drag it left or right, as well as drag it 
down into Track 2.
P Note: Audition makes it easy to transfer files back and forth between the Multitrack Editor and 
Waveform Editor. To open a Multitrack Editor audio file in the Waveform Editor, double-click the clip 
in the Multitrack Editor or right-click (Control-click) on it and choose Edit Source File.
P Note: To transfer the file back into the Multitrack Editor at the position from which it came, click 
the Multitrack button or type 0. To transfer it elsewhere in the session, or even to a different session, 
right-click (Control-click) in the Waveform Editor and choose Insert into Multitrack > [name of 
Multitrack Session]. The file will start at the Multitrack Editor’s playhead position and be inserted into 
the first available track where no audio is recorded at the playhead position.
12 In preparation for the next lesson, click on each recorded audio selection, and 
press the Delete key to remove all audio from the project. Click the Transport’s 
Move Playhead to Previous button.
drag and drop into an audition editor
In addition to recording files into Audition, you can drag and drop files from 
the desktop or any open computer folder (whose contents are visible) into the 
Waveform Editor or a Multitrack Editor track. The file can be in any file format that 
Audition recognizes; in the Multitrack Editor, it will automatically be converted to 
the project settings. For example, if you created a project with 24-bit resolution, 
you can bring it in as a 16-bit WAV file or even an MP3 format file.
With the Waveform Editor, you simply drag the file from the desktop into the edi-
tor. This lesson demonstrates how to drag and drop a file into the Multitrack Editor.
1 This lesson assumes the Multitrack Editor from the previous lesson is still open. 
If not, choose File > New > Multitrack Session. Leave the default folder location 
as is, and select 24 Track Music Session as the template.

150 
Lesson 8 
Creating and Recording Files
2 Make sure the Lesson08 folder is on your desktop, and open it to reveal its three 
files. If needed, resize Audition’s window so you can see Audition’s tracks and 
the open Lesson08 folder at the same time.
3 Drag the file Caliente Bass.wav to the start of Track 1. A yellow line appears 
where the dragged file will start; this should be flush with the beginning of the 
track. Note that if you drag slightly past (to the left of) the track’s beginning, the 
yellow line will “snap” to the track’s start. Release the mouse button.
4 Similarly, drag the file Caliente Drums.wav into Track 2 and the file Caliente 
Guitar.wav into Track 3.
5 Click the Transport Play button to hear the tracks play back simultaneously.
6 These tracks were recorded at a high volume, and they are overloading the 
output. Adjust each track’s volume control to -6dB (the Transport can either 
be playing or stopped).
7 Click the Transport’s Move Playhead to Previous button until the playhead is at 
the beginning of the song.
8 Click Play. The sound is now undistorted, and none of the meters go into the red 
(clipping) zone.
P Note: The line that 
separates the bottom of 
one track and the top of 
another is a splitter bar.  
You can click on this line 
and drag up or down 
to decrease or increase, 
respectively, the above 
track’s height.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRoom in A book 151

Because the tracks on audio CDs are in a specific file format, they cannot be 
dragged directly into Audition without processing. However, you can access a func-
tion that extracts audio from CDs and places it into the Waveform Editor. You can 
then edit it or transfer it to the Multitrack Editor as described previously.
You need a standard audio CD to complete this lesson.
1 Close Audition and don’t save anything in order to start fresh.
2 Open Audition. You can extract audio from CDs in either the Waveform Editor 
or Multitrack Editor, or even if no project is open. 
3 Insert a standard audio CD into your computer’s optical drive.
4 Choose File > Extract Audio from CD.
A dialog box appears that shows the drive, and if the computer is connected 
to the Internet, Audition retrieves information from the freedb database to 
populate the Track, Title, and Duration fields. 
5 The Speed drop-down menu lets you choose the extraction speed. Leave it at 
the default (Maximum Speed); if errors occur during the extraction process, 
choose a slower speed.
6 All CD tracks are selected as the default. They will be extracted one at a time, 
each as a separate file. You need to extract only one track for this lesson, so click 
the Toggle All button to deselect all tracks, and then select one track. 
7 Click OK. The extraction process begins and places the audio in the Waveform 
Editor. Leave Audition open in preparation for the next lesson.

152 
Lesson 8 
Creating and Recording Files
saving a template
A template is a snapshot of all the session settings at the time of saving the tem-
plate. Audition includes several template files for Multitrack Sessions, but you can 
also create your own. 
1 Choose File > New > Multitrack Session.
2 The Session Name and Folder Location don’t matter.
3 Choose None as the Template from the drop-down menu, and then choose the 
desired Sample Rate, Bit Depth, and Master Output. Click OK.
4 Arrange the Multitrack Session session as desired including the number of 
tracks, layout, processors in the tracks, levels, and so on. These settings will be 
incorporated into the template.
5 After you have everything set to your liking and are ready to make a template, 
choose File > Save As.
6 Name the session with the desired template name (e.g., VO + Stereo Sound Track). 
7 For the Location, click Browse. On Windows, navigate to Computer > C: 
Drive > Users > Public > Public Documents > Adobe > Audition > 6.0. Click 
Session Templates, click Open, and then click Save. On a Mac, browse to root 
drive > Users > Shared > Adobe > Audition > 5.0. Click Session Templates, and 
then click Save. Next time you open a new Multitrack Session, the template you 
created will be available in the drop-down menu of templates.

154
Multitrack Editor 
oriEntation 
lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Integrate the Waveform and Multitrack Editors so you can switch 
back and forth between the two   
• Play back a specific part of music repeatedly (looped playback)
• Edit track level and position in the stereo field
• Apply EQ, effect, and send areas in tracks
• Apply EQ to tracks using the Multitrack Editor’s built-in 
parametric EQ
• Apply effects to individual tracks
• Process multiple tracks with a single effect to save CPU power and 
produce more consistent results
• Map effects channels so that outputs can feed different audio 
channels than the default settings
• Set up side-chain effects so that one track can control the effect in 
another track
This lesson takes about 70 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve  
copied the Lesson09 folder that contains the audio examples into the 
Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

155
The Multitrack Editor is where you assemble clips, add 
effects, change levels and panning, and create buses 
for routing tracks to various effects. 

156 
Lesson 9 
Multitrack editor orientation
about multitrack production
Before beginning the lessons, it’s important to understand a Multitrack Session’s 
workflow so the lessons have a context.
In the Waveform Editor, a single clip is the only audio element. A multitrack pro-
duction assembles multiple audio clips to create a musical composition. The audio 
resides in tracks, which you can think of as “containers” for clips. For example, 
one track could contain drum sounds, another bass, a third vocals, and so on. A 
track can contain a single long clip or multiple short clips that can be identical or 
different. A clip can even be positioned on top of another clip in a track (however, 
only the clip that is on top will play back), or clips can overlap to create crossfades 
(described in Lesson 11).
The production process consists of four main stages:
• Tracking. This involves recording or importing audio into the Multitrack 
Session. For example, with a rock band, tracking could consist of recording 
drums, bass, guitar, and vocals. These might be recorded individually (each 
player records a track, typically while listening to a metronome for reference) in 
particular combinations (e.g., drums and bass recorded simultaneously) or as an 
ensemble (all instruments play live and are recorded as they play). 
• Overdubbing. This is the process of recording additional tracks. For example, a 
singer might sing a harmony line to supplement the original vocal.
• Editing. After recording the tracks, editing can polish them. For example, 
with a vocal track you could remove the audio between verses and choruses to 
reduce any residual noise or leakage from other instruments. You might even 
alter the arrangement, like cut a solo section to half its original length.
• Mixing. After editing, the tracks are blended together into a final stereo or 
surround file. The mixing process primarily involves adjusting levels and adding 
effects. A Multitrack Session in Audition CS6 provides the tools to do basic 
editing tasks during the mixing process, but if detailed edits are needed, Session 
audio can be transferred to the Waveform Editor for further editing.
Multitrack and Waveform Editor integration
A unique Adobe Audition feature is that it offers different environments for wave-
form editing and multitrack production. In addition, these are not isolated from 
each other. Audio in the Multitrack Editor is catalogued in the Waveform Editor’s 
file selector and can be opened in the Waveform Editor for editing. This lesson 
illustrates how the Multitrack and Waveform Editors work together.
P Note: Some 
processes are available 
only in one editor or 
the other. If a menu 
option is gray in either 
editor, that option is not 
available.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 157
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson09 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session MoebiusRemix.sesx from the MoebiusRemix folder.
2 Place the playhead at the beginning of the file, and click the Transport Play 
button. Like the Waveform Editor, the Multitrack Editor plays linearly from 
start to finish. However, because the Multitrack Editor consists of multiple, 
parallel tracks, each of which can play back a clip, multiple clips can play back 
simultaneously. Play the song to become familiar with it.
3 To check out the Waveform and Multitrack Editor integration, click the first clip 
in the Main Drums track (Drums_F#L) to select it.
4 Click the Waveform tab to switch to the Waveform Editor.
5 The clip you clicked on appears in the Waveform Editor, ready for editing. 
6 Click the Waveform Editor’s file selector drop-down menu. It shows all the clips 
in the Multitrack Session so that you can choose any of them for editing. 
7 Choose the file Bass_Sub_F#H for editing. It sounds a bit too loud in the track, 
so you’ll reduce the level by 1dB.
8
Press Ctrl+A (Control+A) to select the entire file.
9
Choose Effects > Amplitude and Compression > Amplify.
10 Reduce the right and left channels by typing in the value -1dB, and then click Apply.
11 Click the Multitrack tab to return to the Multitrack Session. All the Bass_
Sub_F#H clip levels have been reduced by 1dB.
12 Keep the project open for the next lesson.
P Note: You’ll often 
see multiple versions 
of the same clip in 
the Multitrack Editor. 
However, there is only 
one physical clip, which 
is stored in RAM; the 
graphic clips in the 
Multitrack Editor just 
reference the physical 
clip. For example, if 
there are four copies 
of the same clip in 
a row, four separate 
clips don’t play back 
sequentially—the clip 
stored in RAM plays four 
times, as instructed by 
the Multitrack Editor.
P Note: You could 
adjust the level of each 
clip in the Multitrack 
Editor or lower the 
level while mixing, but 
sometimes it’s simpler 
just to modify the clip 
so all instances that 
“point” to this clip use 
the edited version.

158 
Lesson 9 
Multitrack editor orientation
looped playback
In several of these lessons, you’ll be hearing what happens when several tracks 
with parallel clips play back simultaneously. As a result, you’ll likely want to loop 
sections containing these clips for playback so that you don’t have to wait through 
parts of the music that don’t contain the clips you want to hear. Here’s how to select 
a section of music for looped playback.
1 Choose the Time Selection tool from the main program toolbar, or press T.
2 In an empty part of the Multitrack Editor (e.g., the Master Track at the bottom 
of the Multitrack Editor), drag the white handles in the timeline to set the In 
and Out loop points, or drag across the portion of the music you want to loop.
3 Click the Transport Loop Playback button.
4 Click the Transport Play button. The looped area will play continuously. 
5 Click the Transport Stop button, and click the Transport Loop Playback button 
to deselect it. 
6 Return to the Move tool by choosing it from the main program toolbar, or press V.
track controls
Each track has multiple controls arranged as two sections, which primarily affect 
playback. One section has a fixed set of controls, whereas the other section is an 
area whose controls change according to a particular selected function. To reveal 
these controls, complete the following steps.
1 Click the splitter bar between the Main Drums track and Bass track, and 
continue holding down the mouse button.
2 Drag down to extend the height of the Main Drums track. 
Main track controls
The main track controls are the most commonly adjusted parameters for mixing. 
1 Click the Transport Play button to begin playback.
2 Click the Main Drums track’s M (Mute) button to silence it. Note that the Mute 
button is green when active and gray when it is off (not muted).
3 Click the Mute button again to unmute. 
E Tip: You can resize 
the heights of all tracks 
simultaneously by 
placing the cursor over 
the track controls area 
and using the mouse 
scroll wheel.
P Note: If both the 
Mute and Solo buttons 
are enabled, the Mute 
button has priority.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 159
4 Click the track’s S button to solo the track. Only the Main Drums track will sound. 
(The R button is for recording; do not click it for now.) Leave the Main Drums 
track soloed for all the following lessons unless instructed to do otherwise.
P Note: There are two solo modes—Exclusive (soloing one track mutes all other tracks) and 
Non-Exclusive (the default; you can solo multiple tracks simultaneously). To override either mode, 
Ctrl-click (Command-click) on the Solo button. To choose one mode or the other as a default, choose 
Edit > Preferences > Multitrack (Audition > Preferences > Multitrack) and select the desired Track 
Solo preference.
5 You can move tracks to reorganize them in a way that makes sense to you. For 
example, you might prefer to have the Percussion track below the Main Drums 
track instead of the Bass track. On the same row as the Mute and Solo buttons, 
click the waveform icon to the left of the Percussion track, and drag it up until a 
yellow line appears at the bottom of the Main Drums track. This line indicates 
where the top of the dragged track will “land.” Release the mouse button to leave 
the Percussion track below the Main Drums track.
6 With the transport playing, click the Volume knob immediately below the left 
part of the Main Drums name, and then drag up/down or left/right to vary the 
playback volume. The track meters will go “into the red” if you turn this up too 
high. For now, leave the Volume at 0.
7 Click the Pan knob to its right. This changes the track position in the stereo 
field. Drag left, and you’ll hear the audio coming out of only the left speaker 
or headphone. Drag right, and the audio will play from only the right 
speaker or headphone.
8 Click the Sum to Mono button to the right. This “collapses” the stereo field to the 
center so the stereo file plays back in mono. Click on it again to return to stereo.
9 Return the Pan control to 0.
E Tip: If a track’s 
signal goes “into the 
red,” the track meters’ 
red lights will remain 
lit so you know the 
track exceeded the 
maximum level, even if 
you weren’t looking at 
it. To reset the red lights 
and turn them off, click 
on the lights.
P Note: If dragging 
the Pan knob left places 
in the audio to the right, 
check the connections 
going to your speakers 
and audio interface.
E Tip: A shortcut 
to return the Volume 
or Pan control to the 
default of 0 is to Alt-
click (Option-click) on 
the control that you 
want to reset.

Lesson 9 
Multitrack editor orientation
track area
Extending a track’s height, either by click-dragging the track’s lower splitter bar 
downward or clicking in the Track Editor area and rotating the mouse scroll wheel, 
reveals an area below the main track controls. You can display one of four sets of 
controls in this area, as determined by the four buttons in the left section of the 
Multitrack Editor’s toolbar:
• Input and outputs
• Track Effects Rack
• Sends
• EQ
the EQ area
EQ is widely considered one of the most important effects for multitrack produc-
tion, because it allows each track to “carve out” its own sonic space in the audio fre-
quency spectrum (see Lesson 15, “Mixing,” for an in-depth discussion of applying 
EQ during multitrack production). As a result, each track has the option to insert a 
Parametric EQ effect. Let’s do that now.
1 Drag the Main Drums track’s lower splitter bar downward to show the track 
area, and click the toolbar’s EQ button (the rightmost button with vertical 
lines). The EQ area displays an EQ graph; it’s currently a straight line, because 
no changes have been made.
2 Click the pencil button to the left of the EQ graph.
3 The Parametric EQ effect appears. This is identical to the Parametric EQ effect 
covered in the “Filter and EQ effects” section in Lesson 4.
4 Choose Acoustic Guitar from the Presets menu—just because it’s named 
Acoustic Guitar doesn’t mean it can’t be used for drums! 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 161
5 Close the EQ window. Note that the EQ area now shows the EQ curve. Click 
the EQ area’s power state toggle button; the EQ frequency response curve turns 
blue to show that the EQ is active, and the power state button glows green. 
Leave the EQ enabled.
6 Click the Transport Play button. You’ll hear that the EQ makes the drums sound 
a little more defined.
the Effects rack area
Each track has its own Effects Rack so you can add signal processing to individual 
tracks; this Effects Rack is almost identical to the Waveform Editor Effects Rack 
covered in Lesson 4. This lesson covers using the features that differ.
1 Click the fx button in the Multitrack Editor’s main four-button toolbar.
2 The track’s Effects Rack area appears. Increase the track height so you see 16 
slots—just like the Effects Rack in the Waveform Editor. You can choose from 
the same effects, including VST (Windows or Mac) and AU (Mac-only) effects.
3 The main difference compared to the Waveform Editor Effects Rack is that you 
can change the position of the effects in the Multitrack Editor’s signal flow. To 
hear how this works, click the Main Drums track’s insert 1 right arrow, and then 
choose Delay and Echo > Analog Delay. 
4 Choose Canyon Echos from the Presets menu, and then set Feedback to 70. 
Click the Transport Play button; you should hear lots of repeating echoes.
5 Three buttons are located above the inserts. The leftmost button is a master 
effects on/off button, which is enabled automatically when you insert an effect. 
Click it to turn off the Analog Delay effect, and then click it again to turn the 
Analog Delay effect back on.
6 The next button to the right is the FX Pre-Fader/Post-Fader control, which 
selects whether the Effects Rack is before (the default) or after the track’s 
Volume control. With the track playing, turn down the track’s Volume control. 
Note that this turns down the echoes as well, because the effect is pre-fader— 
in other words, “upstream” of the fader.
P Note: If before 
closing the Parametric 
EQ’s window you toggle 
the Parametric EQ 
window’s power state 
button so the power 
is on, the power will 
already be on in the 
EQ area.

162 
Lesson 9 
Multitrack editor orientation
7 Turn the track Volume control back to 0, and then click the FX Pre-Fader/ 
Post-Fader button. It turns red to indicate that the effect is now post-fader.
8 Let the track play for several seconds, and then turn down the track’s Volume 
control. The echoes continue because you’ve turned down only the signal going 
to the Analog Delay, not the signal coming out of it.
9 Click on the first insert’s right triangle, and then choose Remove Effect so that 
the Analog Delay effect is no longer inserted.
10 Turn off the Main Drums track’s Solo button so you can hear all tracks play 
simultaneously.
the Master track output
Before you look at the Sends area in the next section, you first need to understand 
the concept of a bus. Although buses appear in the Multitrack Editor like tracks 
and have several elements in common, they serve a different purpose.
A bus does not contain audio clips but instead carries a specific mix of one or 
more tracks. Every Multitrack Session has at least one bus—the Master bus, which 
provides the Master Track output. This can be mono, stereo, or 5.1 surround, as 
specified by the Master parameter when you open a new Multitrack Session.
All tracks feed into the Master bus, and therefore, the Master Track’s Volume con-
trol regulates the master volume of all tracks. This is essential because as you add 
more tracks to a composition, the output level increases. Eventually, it will likely 
start distorting, but you can use the Master Track Volume control to adjust the 
output level and prevent distortion.
P Note: If the track 
Volume control 
remains turned down, 
eventually the echoes 
will stop because 
there won’t be any 
more audio going 
into the Analog Delay, 
so there won’t be 
any audio subject to 
being delayed.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 163
about Buses
In addition to the capabilities provided by a Master bus, buses have two other 
main functions: adding effects and creating monitor mixes.
adding effects
You’ll often want to add an effect to several tracks. A common example is reverb, 
which creates the illusion of those tracks playing in a common acoustical space, 
like a concert hall. Although you could add a reverb for each track, this has two 
main disadvantages:
•
Each reverb requires CPU power. With older computers or highly complex 
projects, using more effects can slow down performance and possibly even 
reduce the total track count. 
•
It’s more difficult to create the illusion of a single acoustic space if there are 
multiple acoustic spaces distributed among various tracks. 
The solution is to send audio from each track that should have reverb to a bus and 
insert a single reverb in the bus’s Effects Rack. This greatly reduces the amount of 
CPU load, and because there’s only a single reverb, it sounds more like a single 
acoustic space. The amount of audio sent to the bus controls the amount of reverb; 
for example, if you want a vocalist to have lots of reverb, you would turn up the 
vocal track’s send control to the reverb. 
creating mixes (also called monitor mixes)
When musicians record a part, they often want to hear a specific mix in their head-
phones as they play. For example, the bass player will want to lock the rhythm to the 
drums and will likely want to hear louder drums compared to the other instruments. 
However, the vocalist, who is paying more attention to the melody, will likely want 
to hear more melodic instruments, like piano and guitar.
To accommodate each player, you would create two buses and send each bus’s out-
put to a separate headphone amp. The bus going to the vocalist would have more 
send from the piano and guitar, whereas the bus going to the bass player would 
have more send from the drums.
1 Scroll down to the bottom of the Multitrack Editor and locate the Master Track.
2 Expand the Master Track height sufficiently to see the output meters. 
3 Click the Play button to start playback. Note that the Master Track Volume 
control is set to -4.5dB; the project was saved this way so when you opened the 
file and started to play it, you wouldn’t hear distortion. At no point does the 
Master Track output meter go into the red.
4 Stop playback, and then return the playhead to the file’s beginning.
5 Alt-click (Option-click) the Master Track Volume control to return it to zero, 
and then click Play to start playback.
E Tip: Most engineers 
agree that you don’t 
want to have to reduce 
a Master Volume control 
too much. If it becomes 
necessary to lower it 
much more than -12dB 
or so, reduce the Volume 
controls for individual 
tracks to reduce the 
output level. This allows 
the Master bus Volume 
control to remain 
between 0 and -6dB.

164 
Lesson 9 
Multitrack editor orientation
6 Note that the meter goes into the red starting around measure 5 when the Main 
Drums are joined by other tracks. 
7 Click Stop to stop playback. Return the Master Track Volume control to -4.5dB.
the Sends area
Each track has a Sends area. You can create buses in this area, as well as control bus 
levels and other parameters.
1 Click the Sends button (the one between the fx and EQ buttons) in the 
Multitrack Editor’s main four-button toolbar. The track’s Sends area appears.
2 Increase the Main Drums and Percussion track heights so you can see the Send 
area’s controls.
3 To add stereo reverb to both tracks, click the Main Drums’ Send area drop-
down menu and choose Add Bus > Stereo. This creates a Bus immediately 
below the Main Drums track.
4 Click in the Bus A name field and type Reverb Bus. Note that the bus name 
changes automatically in the Main Drums Send area drop-down menu.
P Note: The Master 
Track is unique and 
omits some features 
that standard buses 
have (as described in 
the sidebar “About 
Buses”).
P Note: You can 
also add a bus by 
right-clicking (Control-
clicking) in a blank 
space in a track and 
then choosing Track > 
Add (Mono, Stereo, or 
5.1) Bus Track. The bus 
appears immediately 
below the track where 
you right-clicked. 
Also, note that when 
you create a bus, its 
output is assigned 
automatically to 
the Master bus as 
the default.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 165
5 Click the Percussion Send area drop-down menu. Because you created a Reverb 
bus, it appears in the list of available send destinations. Choose Reverb bus.
6 Now insert a reverb in the Reverb bus. Start by clicking the fx button in the 
track toolbar.
7 An Effects Rack appears in the Reverb bus that works identically to the Effects 
Rack in individual tracks. 
8 Click the right triangle in the Reverb bus’s first insert, and then choose Reverb > 
Studio Reverb.
9 When the Studio Reverb dialog box appears, choose Drum Plate (large) from 
the Presets drop-down menu. Set the Dry slider to 0 and Wet to 100%. Close the 
Studio Reverb dialog box.
10 Return to the Sends area by clicking the Sends button in the toolbar.
11 Solo the Main Drums and Percussion tracks to make it easy to hear the effect of 
adding reverb. Audition “knows” to solo the Reverb bus automatically, because 
the Main Drums and Percussion tracks send signal to it.
12 Click the Transport Play button to begin playback.
13 Turn up the Main Drums send Volume control to around -6dB. You’ll now hear 
reverb added to the Main Drums track.
14 Turn up the Percussion send Volume control to around +5dB. When the 
Percussion clips play, you’ll hear lots of reverb. The reason is that more audio is 
being sent to the Reverb bus compared to the Main Drums.
15 You can set the overall amount of wet (reverb) sound with the Reverb bus 
Volume control. Vary this control between -8dB and +8dB to hear how this 
affects the sound. Then Alt-click (Option-click) this control to return it to 0.
16 You can also pan a bus in the stereo field. Vary the Reverb bus Pan control 
from L100 to R100, and you’ll hear the reverb effect move from left to right, 
respectively. Alt-click (Option-click) this control to return it to 0.
P Note: When you’re 
using effects with Wet/
Dry controls as send 
effects, the tracks 
providing the sends are 
already providing dry 
audio to the Master bus. 
Therefore, the effects 
are set to full wet audio 
and no dry audio. The 
bus Volume control sets 
the overall amount of 
wet signal present in 
the Master bus.

166 
Lesson 9 
Multitrack editor orientation
17 Turn off the Solo buttons for the Main Drums and Percussion tracks. In 
preparation for the next lesson, leave this project open with the various track 
and bus controls set as shown.
Sending buses to buses
Buses can also send audio to other buses, which multiplies your signal processing 
options even further. In this lesson, you’ll send two tracks to a Delay bus, and that 
bus will feed the Reverb bus created in the previous lesson.
1 Right-click on a blank space in the Pad DreamyBrass track, and choose 
Track > Add Stereo Bus Track to create a bus immediately below the Pad 
DreamyBrass track.
2 Click in the Bus B name field and type Delay Bus. 
3 If necessary, extend the heights of the Pad DreamyBrass, Delay Bus, and Organ 
Church tracks so you can see their Send areas.
4 Click the Pad DreamyBrass Send drop-down menu and choose Delay Bus. 
5 Click the Organ Church Send drop-down menu and choose Delay Bus. 
6 Now insert a Delay in the Delay bus. Start by clicking on the Multitrack Editor’s 
main toolbar’s fx button.
7 Click the right triangle in the Delay bus’s first insert, and then choose Delay and 
Echo > Analog Delay.
E Tip: A track’s Send 
area also includes an FX 
Pre-Fader/Post-Fader 
button. This determines 
whether the signal 
going to the Send 
volume control is pre or 
post the Track Volume 
control. The default is 
post-fader, because if 
you reduce the track 
level, you generally 
don’t want to still hear 
the wet sound at the 
same level as when the 
track level was higher. 
If you do (perhaps for 
a special effect where 
a track goes from 
dry+wet to full wet), 
click the FX Pre-Fader/
Post-Fader button 
so that the button is 
not red.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 167
8 When the Analog Delay dialog box appears, choose Round-robin Delay from 
the Presets drop-down menu. Set the Dry Out slider to 0, Wet to 100%, and 
Spread to 200%; enter exactly 2000ms for Delay, and set Trash to 0. Close the 
Analog Delay dialog box.
9 Return to the Sends area by clicking the Sends button in the toolbar.
10 Solo the Pad DreamyBrass and Organ Church tracks, and then set each of these 
track’s send Volume controls to around -8dB to add just a bit of delay.
11 Position the playhead at the start of measure 7, and then click the Transport 
Play button to begin playback and hear the effect of the added delay.
12 Now that the delay effect is set up, choose Reverb Bus from the Delay Bus send 
drop-down menu. This sends the Delay bus output to the Reverb bus, and you’ll 
hear delay going through reverb. 
13 Turn up the Delay bus Send control to around +4dB. You’ll now hear 
reverberated delay.
14 To contrast the delay sound with and without reverb, toggle the Delay bus 
power state button.
15 Close Adobe Audition without saving your changes (choose No to All in the 
dialog box) in preparation for the next lesson.
channel mapping in the Multitrack Editor
The channel mapping feature is available for all effects in the Waveform Editor and 
the Multitrack Editor but is most appropriate for multitrack productions. It allows 
for mapping any effect input to any effect input and any effect output to any effect 
output. This is primarily of interest for surround mixes, because you can place an 
effect output into a particular surround channel. However, this lesson shows that 
channel mapping can also be useful with stereo effects for altering the stereo image.
1 Open Audition and choose File > Open Recent > MoebiusRemix.sesx.
2 Click the Main Drums Solo button, and click the fx button in the toolbar. 
Extend the Main Drums track enough to see the Effects Rack inserts.
3 Click insert 1’s right arrow and choose Reverb > Convolution Reverb.
4 From the Impulse (not Presets) drop-down menu, choose Massive Cavern. Set 
Width to 300% and Mix to 70%.
P Note: The Delay 
value of 2000ms (in 
the “Sending buses 
to buses” section) is 
chosen so that the 
delay correlates to the 
tempo. For details on 
how to arrive at this 
number, review the 
“Analog Delay” section 
in Lesson 4.

168 
Lesson 9 
Multitrack editor orientation
5 Loop a portion of the Main Drums track, and click the Transport Play button.
6 Click the Convolution Reverb effect’s Channel Map Editor button. 
7 The Channel Map Editor opens. Click the Left Effect Output field drop-down 
menu, and choose Right.
8 Click the Right Effect Output field drop-down menu, and choose Left. The 
output channels are now reversed, which reverses the reverb output’s stereo 
image. The image is wider, because some of the left input now appears in the 
right output, and some of the right input is now in the left output.
9 To hear the difference, click the Channel Map Editor’s Reset Routing button. 
If you listen on headphones, you’ll hear a definite collapsing (narrowing) of the 
stereo image; this will be more subtle on speakers.
applying the channel Map Editor 
in the Multitrack Editor
The applications for the Channel Map Editor are obvious for 5.1 surround, because 
you can direct effect outputs to various audio channels: left, right, front, back, cen-
ter, or even the sub-woofer.
With stereo, the Channel Map Editor is relevant only with effects that generate 
different audio for the left and right outputs, such as Reverb, Echo, and the various 
Modulation effects. The main uses in the Multitrack Editor are to create more interest-
ing stereo images with individual tracks or when using the same effect in more than 
one place (e.g., the same effect in two buses, in one track and one bus, in two tracks, 
etc.), because reversing the imaging on one of the effects can add more variety.
P Note: Because 
both outputs can’t 
be assigned to the 
same audio channel 
in the Channel Map 
Editor, the Right Effect 
Output, which had been 
assigned to Right, is 
now assigned to (None). 
Therefore, you will hear 
the Right channel Effect 
Output in the Left audio 
channel, and no effect 
output in the Right 
audio channel. 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 169
Side-chaining effects
The side-chaining effects-related technique is available only in the Multitrack 
Editor, because it requires at least two tracks.
Side-chaining uses the output from one track to control an effect in a different 
track. In this lesson, you’ll use side-chaining to automatically reduce the level of a 
background music bed when narration occurs.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson09 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session Side-chaining.sesx located in the Side-chaining folder.
2 Click the Transport Play button. Note how the background music drowns out 
the narration.
3 Click the Multitrack Editor’s main toolbar fx button to open the Effects area. 
4 Click the right arrow in the BackgroundMusic track’s first effects insert, and 
then choose Amplitude and Compression > Dynamics Processing. 
5 When the Dynamics Processing interface opens, choose Broadcast Limiter from 
the Presets menu.
6 Click the Set Side-Chain Input button and choose Stereo. Leave the Dynamics 
Processing effect open, because you’ll need to tweak its settings.
7 Click the Multitrack Editor’s main toolbar Sends button to open the Sends area.
8 In the Narration track, click the send and choose Side-Chain > Dynamics 
Processing (Background Music – Slot 1).
9 Return the playhead to the beginning, and click the Transport Play button.

170 
Lesson 9 
Multitrack editor orientation
10 The background music does get softer when narration occurs, but it follows the 
narration too closely; the sound isn’t smooth, because the background music 
spikes higher in level during even brief pauses in narration. To fix this, click the 
Dynamics Processing Settings tab to change various settings.
11 Select Noise Gating under the general header Attack and Release, because 
expanding levels downward will exceed 50:1, and more of a gating action—
where the background music is either “loud” or “soft”—is the desired type 
of response.
12 Click the Link Channels button (in the Gain Processor section under the 
Settings tab) to ensure that changes in one channel are imposed on the other 
channel, so there aren’t significant level variations between the two channels. 
13 Set the Level Detector and Gain Processor Attack Times to 0ms. This will cause 
compression to start as soon as the Dynamics Processing side-chain input 
detects narration.
14 Increasing release times retains the compression action for the specified time in 
the absence of narration. Set the Level Detector Release Time to around 500ms.
15 Adjust the Gain Processor Release Time slider for the most even response. 
A setting of approximately 1200ms seems about optimum.
16 Click the Transport Play button. Note how when the narration stops, the 
background music fades up, based on the Release Time settings. When the 
narration resumes, compression lowers the level of the background music.
E Tip: If the level of 
the background music 
is too soft, reduce the 
amount of compression 
in the Dynamics 
Processing effect. For 
example, set Segment 
1 so that its end points 
are at -20dB instead 
of -30dB.
P Note: The Dynamics 
Processing effect is 
the only one within 
Audition that has a side-
chain input. However, 
some VST3 effects have 
side-chain inputs as 
well. The effects most 
likely to have side-chain 
inputs are dynamics 
processors and 
Noise Gates.

The MulTiTrack Mixer View 
lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Switch from the Multitrack Editor to the Mixer view 
• Adjust the Mixer fader heights to allow for greater resolution 
when setting levels
• Show/hide various areas to customize the Mixer size and 
configuration
• Scroll through different Effects Racks inserts and Sends within 
their respective areas 
• Scroll to view different groups of channels if the Mixer window 
isn’t wide enough to show them all
• Differentiate among channel types via color coding
• Rearrange the Mixer channel order
This lesson takes about 25 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve 
copied the Lesson10 folder that contains the project example into the 
Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

173
The Mixer view is an alternate way to look at a  
multitrack project; it’s optimized for mixing rather 
than editing the multitrack project’s tracks. 

174 
Lesson 10 The Multitrack Mixer View
Mixer view basics
Multitrack projects can have two different views. So far, you’ve been working with 
the Multitrack Editor, which as its name implies, is optimized for editing. However, 
the Mixer tab (to the left of the Multitrack Editor tab) accesses another way to work 
with multitrack projects and is optimized for mixing.
The Multitrack Editor shows the clips within various tracks. The Mixer does not 
show clips but has a corresponding Mixer channel for each Multitrack Editor track. 
The reason for calling a Mixer channel a “channel” instead of a track is because 
hardware mixers use that term; in physical studios, there isn’t necessarily a one-to-
one correlation between tracks and channels (e.g., one tape recorder track could 
feed more than one mixer channel).
Although the Multitrack Editor provides mixing functions, such as altering levels 
and panning (a track’s position in the stereo field), several mixing functions (sends, 
EQ, effects, and ins/outs) share a common area and you can only see the settings 
for one of these functions at a time. With the Mixer, all of these functions are 
arranged as rows and can be viewed simultaneously.
Mixing typically occurs after the various tracks are recorded and edited, and you’re 
ready to concentrate solely on blending all the tracks together to create a cohesive lis-
tening experience. However, even when editing, there are often times when it makes 
more sense from a workflow standpoint to temporarily switch over to the Mixer.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson10 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session Mixer.sesx.
2 After clicking the Multitrack button (if necessary), click the Mixer tab.
3 The Mixer uses faders instead of rotary controls to adjust level. The higher you 
can extend the Mixer, the longer the faders. Click the splitter bar toward the 
bottom of the Mixer panel, and drag down as far as possible to make the faders 
as long as possible.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 175
4 Click on the same splitter bar, and drag up. Note that the faders get shorter. 
Continue dragging up; eventually the faders will collapse. Return the faders to 
the longest size allowed by your screen, consistent with still being able to access 
the Transport buttons.
5 Keep the project open in preparation for the next lesson.
P Note: Long-throw hardware faders are desirable in hardware mixers because it’s easier to do 
precise, “high-resolution” mixing moves. The same is true of “virtual” faders in software. When 
Audition’s faders are extended to their greatest height, you can edit levels easily in 0.1dB steps. In 
the Multitrack Editor, the most resolution you can achieve with the rotary Volume controls is 0.3dB, 
and that requires a precise touch.
using hardware controllers
Although being able to mix onscreen is convenient, many engineers prefer the 
“human touch” of using physical faders. Audition supports various control surfaces—
hardware devices that include faders and can control the onscreen faders. Many 
control surfaces can also control the Mute and Solo buttons, transport, arm tracks 
for record, and more.
Audition supports several control surface protocols: Mackie Control, Avid/Euphonix 
EUCON, PreSonus FaderPort, and ADS Tech RedRover. Of these, Mackie Control is by 
far the most popular, and several control surfaces from multiple manufacturers are 
compatible with this protocol.
Adding a control surface is easy. Choose Edit > Preferences > Control Surface. Under 
Device Class, choose the type (e.g., Mackie Control), and then click Configure. This 
brings up a dialog box where you can add the control surface and specify the MIDI 
ports (input and output) to which the control surface connects. 
E Tip: Undocking the 
Mixer window is very 
convenient, because it 
can be a consistent size 
and you don’t have to 
be concerned about 
resizing it. Undocking 
is also a natural for 
two-monitor setups, 
because you can put 
the Mixer in its own 
dedicated monitor and 
the editor section in the 
other monitor.

Lesson 10 The Multitrack Mixer View
Mixer show/hide options
Most rows of Mixer modules have an expand/collapse disclosure triangle. You can 
customize how much space the Mixer takes up on the screen and automatically 
change the relative fader height by showing or hiding different parts of the Mixer.
1 With the fx area closed, you can still see the fx area’s master fx power state 
button, the FX Pre-Fader/Post-Fader button, and the pre-render track button 
that’s often used to save CPU power when mixing complex projects (pre-
rendering is covered in detail in Lesson 15, “Mixing”).
Click the fx area disclosure triangle to expand its options. Note that the faders 
become shorter because the fx area now takes up more space.
2 In all channels, you can now see three Effects Rack inserts. You cannot drag 
this area downward to reveal more inserts, but the scroll bar to the right of the 
inserts lets you see all available inserts. Click on the rectangle within the scroll 
bar and drag up or down to see the other inserts; you can also click on the scroll 
bar’s top and bottom arrows to step up or down respectively through one insert 
at a time.
P Note: Two Mixer 
sections cannot be 
hidden: the I/O section 
at the top (polarity 
switch, Input Assign 
drop-down menu, and 
Output Assign drop-
down menu) and the 
channel’s Pan and Sum 
to Mono controls.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 177
3 With the Sends area closed, you can see the number of the currently selected 
sends in the upper-left corner, the power state button, and FX Pre-Fader/Post-
Fader button. Click the Sends area disclosure triangle to expand it. Note that 
again the faders become shorter because the Sends area now takes up more space.
4 One send is shown at a time along with its power state button, FX Pre-Fader/
Post-Fader, Send Volume, Stereo Balance controls, and drop-down menu for 
reassigning the send to a different send (or creating a new send bus or side-
chain send). Like the fx area, a scroll bar is available for choosing the current 
send. In the second channel from the left (labeled Bass), click on the rectangle 
within the scroll bar and drag up or down to see the other sends; you can also 
click on the scroll bar’s top and bottom arrows to step up or down, respectively, 
through one send at a time.
5 With the EQ area closed, no aspect of the EQ area is visible. Click the EQ area 
disclosure triangle to expand it. As with expanding the fx and Sends areas, the 
faders become even shorter to compensate for having less available space.
6 The EQ section works similarly to how it works in the Multitrack Editor. The 
power state button can enable/bypass the EQ. Click the button with the pencil 
icon; you’ll open the channel’s Parametric Equalizer (you can also open it by 
double-clicking on the EQ graph). Click the Parametric EQ’s close box, because 
you won’t be making any adjustments. 
7 Close the fader section by clicking its disclosure triangle. The faders section 
collapses to show the Mute, Solo, Arm for Record, and Monitor Input buttons, 
and also reduces the fader to a Volume control identical to the one found in the 
Multitrack Editor.

178 
Lesson 10 The Multitrack Mixer View
channel scrolling
With projects that have many channels, your monitor may not be wide enough to 
show them all. However, you can scroll though the various channels, as well as see 
which ones are buses, standard tracks, or the Master Track Output bus.
1 Click on the right edge of the Audition window and drag left to narrow the 
Mixer. Make sure that you can’t see all channels in the Mixer.
2 A scroll bar appears along the bottom of the Mixer panel if the panel isn’t wide 
enough to show all channels. Click on the scroll bar rectangle, and drag all the 
way to the right. Now you can see the rightmost group of channels.
3 Drag the scroll bar rectangle full left in preparation for the next lesson.
rearranging Mixer channel order
You’re not limited to an existing left-to-right track order. For example, you may 
have recorded drums first in Multitrack Editor Track 1 and a percussion part in 
Multitrack Editor Track 3; these appear in Mixer channels 1 and 3, respectively. 
However, suppose you’d rather have the Percussion channel next to the Drums 
channel. You can move channels horizontally to anywhere within the Mixer.
1 Hover the cursor over the track you want to move until the cursor turns into a 
hand. There are several places in the channel where this happens, such as right 
below the meter.
P Note: Channel 
faders have different 
colors to indicate their 
function. Standard 
tracks have gray faders; 
buses have yellow 
faders and a yellow 
Mixer symbol to the left 
of the bus name. The 
Master Track Output 
has a blue fader and a 
blue Mixer symbol to 
the left of the Master 
Track name.

Adobe AudiTion Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 179
2 Click and drag left until a yellow line appears to the right of the Main Drums 
channel. This is where the left side of the channel will be moved. (Note that if 
you drag right until you see a yellow line, the right side of the channel will be 
moved there.)
3 Release the mouse button, and the Percussion channel will relocate to the right 
of the Main Drums channel.
4 Click the Editor tab to return to the Multitrack Editor. Note that the track order 
has changed to reflect the channel change you made in the Mixer. 
P Note: The Mixer 
view reflects changes in 
track order made in the 
Multitrack Editor, and 
the Multitrack Editor 
reflects changes in 
track order made in the 
Mixer view.

Editing Clips 
lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Use crossfading—both symmetrical and asymmetrical—to create 
remixes from individual clips 
• Export the mix as a single file
• Pan individual clips on a per-clip basis
• Edit a clip to fit a specific length of time (e.g., for a commercial)
• Apply global clip stretching to fine-tune a piece of music’s 
specific length 
•
Change volume on a per-clip basis
•
Add effects to individual clips
•
Extend a clip via looping
This lesson takes about 50 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve cop-
ied the Lesson11 folder that contains the audio examples into the Lessons 
folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. Remember 
that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, because you 
can always return to the original versions by copying them from the 
Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.
11

183
You can apply a variety of operations to individual 
clips, including combining them with crossfading to 
create a perfect DJ-style continuous mix of music, 
and then bounce the mix to a single file suitable for 
exporting, burning to CD, uploading to the web, 
and so on. 

184 
Lesson 11 
editing Clips
Creating a dJ-style continuous 
music mix with crossfading
Crossfading between clips can provide for smooth transitions between the end of 
one clip and the start of another. However, crossfading is also a crucial element of 
creating a DJ mix. Here, you’ll take five clips and create a dance mix.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson11 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session DJ Mix.sesx located in the DJ Mix folder.
2 With the Editor panel open, right-click (Control-click) on the timeline and 
choose Time Display > Bars and Beats. 
3 Right-click (Control-click) on the timeline and choose Time Display > Edit 
Tempo. Enter 120 in the Tempo field and then click OK. 
4 Click on any clip, and then verify that Automatic Crossfades Enabled (Clip > 
Automatic Crossfades Enabled) is selected so that overlapping one clip with 
another creates a crossfade in the overlapping section.
5 Place the playhead at the project’s beginning and click Play. Listen to the song 
“Poptronica,” and as you listen, make a mental note of where you might like another 
song to start playing. The theme returns at measure 57 and then repeats at measure 
65 before fading out. So, measure 65 is a good candidate for another song to kick in.
6 Now listen to the song “UK Grime.” The first eight measures are an introduction; 
the main part of the song doesn’t start until measure 9.
7 Enable snapping by clicking the Snap button (indicated by a magnet icon) to the 
left of the timeline. Drag “UK Grime” into Track 1 so it overlaps “Poptronica” 
starting at measure 65. This is ideal, because “Poptronica” will fade out over 
eight measures, “UK Grime” will fade in over eight measures, and when 
“Poptronica” finishes fading out, the main part of “UK Grime” will start. 
8 Position the playhead before measure 65, and then click the Play button to hear 
the transition.
9 Proceed to creating the next transition. Listen to the end of “UK Grime”; it goes 
on for a long time, so you’ll probably want to trim it. As the song starts getting 
repetitive at measure 122, you’ll have the clip end at measure 130 to allow for an 
eight-measure crossfade.
P Note: The name for 
each piece of music in 
the Multitrack Session 
DJ Mix lesson starts 
with the name of the 
company that created 
the song and released 
the sound library; the 
song title is the name of 
the library.
E Tip: If snapping 
seems ineffective, 
zoom in to increase the 
resolution and thus the 
snapping “sensitivity.” 
It’s very important in 
the crossfading lesson 
that clips snap precisely 
to the beat, or you’ll 
hear what DJs refer 
to as a “train wreck” 
transition because the 
clips are out of sync 
with each other where 
they overlap. When you 
move a clip, zoom in to 
verify that the edge is 
aligned with a beat.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 185
10 Hover over the right edge of the “UK Grime” clip so the cursor turns into a Trim 
tool (a red right bracket). Drag left until the right edge of “UK Grime” snaps to 
measure 130.
11 Move the playhead to the beginning of the song “Electro Patterns,” and then click 
Play to hear it. With “Electro Patterns,” the first eight measures would be good for 
a fade in, because the main theme starts at the beginning of the ninth measure.
12 Drag “Electro Patterns” into Track 1 so it overlaps “UK Grime” starting at 
measure 122. Play this transition.
13 It would sound stronger if the kick in “Electro Patterns” came in sooner and was 
louder. You can alter the crossfade to do this. Click the Fade In control square in 
the “Electro Patterns” file, and drag it straight up so the tooltip displays Fade In 
Linear Value: 100.
14 Click Play and listen to the transition; it’s much stronger.
15 Listen to the end of “Electro Patterns” and the beginning of “Iced.” “Iced” 
doesn’t really get going until after 16 measures, whereas the ending for “Electro 
Patterns” starts at measure 166. From a musical standpoint, the “Electro 
Patterns” measures that play after measure 166 are kind of heavy and bassy, 
whereas the first part of “Iced” is “lighter.” It’s unclear what would make a good 
transition, so drag “Iced” into Track 1 starting at measure 166 so it overlaps 
“Electro Patterns,” and you’ll tweak it from there.
16 Click on “Electro Patterns” to select it. Hover over its right edge so the 
cursor turns into a Trim tool. Drag left to trim the clip, but leave enough to 
make a good transition area into the next clip; I recommend dragging left 
to measure 174.
17 For the final transition, you’ll try a “mashup” (i.e., two pieces of music playing at 
the same time for a fairly long amount of time). Drag “Acid Jazz City” into Track 
1 starting at measure 192. Return the playhead to the beginning, click Play, and 
enjoy your mix.
18 Keep this project open, so you can save your work as a single file in the next lesson.

186 
Lesson 11 
editing Clips
Mixing or exporting a collection 
of clips as a single file
When creating a DJ mix or chopping up a clip to fit it to a specific length  
(as covered in the next lesson), you might want to save a collection of edited 
clips as a single file that incorporates all the edits you’ve made.
You have two options for doing this. The first option, which converts the clips into 
a single file that appears in the Waveform Editor, is ideal if you want to make some 
overall tweaks on the final, composite file.
1 Right-click (Control-click) in an empty space in the track (in this case, Track 1) 
containing the clips you want to bounce (mix) together into a single, new clip.
2 Choose Mixdown Session to New File > Entire Session. This creates a new file in 
the Waveform Editor and automatically switches to the Waveform Editor.
The second option exports the mix as a single file to your desktop or other desig-
nated folder without going through the Multitrack Editor. Exporting is covered in 
more detail in Lesson 15, “Mixing,” because in almost all cases you’ll want to export 
a final mix to a mono, stereo, or surround file.
1 Right-click (Control-click) in an empty space in the track containing the clips 
you want to bounce (mix) together.
2 Choose Export Mixdown > Entire Session.
A dialog box appears in which you can specify several attributes of the mixed 
file, such as the folder location where the file will be stored, format, sample rate, 
bit resolution, and the like.
3 Select the desired attributes in the dialog box, and then click OK.
4 Close Audition, and when the Save Changes dialog box appears, click No To All.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 187
Editing for length
Music often needs to be cut to fit a specific amount of time—for example, a 30-second  
commercial. In this lesson, you’ll use many of Audition’s clip editing tools to trim 
down a 45-second music clip to make the background for a 30-second commercial.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson11 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session 30SecondSpot.sesx located in the 30SecondSpot folder.
2 Right-click (Control-click) on the timeline and choose Time Display > Decimal 
(mm:ss.ddd) to verify that the music is about 45 seconds long. Then right-click 
(Control-click) on the timeline and choose Time Display > Bars and Beats 
for editing. 
3 Right-click (Control-click) on the timeline and choose Time Display > Edit 
Tempo. Enter 125 in the Tempo field, and then click OK.
The first two measures and next four measures are similar except that there’s a 
bass in measures 3 and 4 that leads well into the next section. So, you’ll delete 
the first two measures.
4 Choose the Time Selection tool or press T.
5 If necessary, click the Snap button to enable snapping.
6 Click at measure 3:1 and drag left to select the first two measures. Zoom in far 
enough to ensure accurate snapping.
7 Choose Edit > Ripple Delete > Time Selection in All Tracks. 
The section of the music that starts at measure 7 is similar to the section that 
starts at measure 11. So, let’s eliminate measures 7–10.
8
Click at the beginning of measure 11:1, and drag left until measure 7:1.
9
Choose Edit > Ripple Delete > Time Selection in All Tracks.
10 Keep this project open for the next lesson.
P Note: To edit a piece 
of music so that it’s a 
particular length, you’ll 
want to alternate the 
time display between 
Decimal—to see how 
edits to the music 
affect length—and 
then return to Bars 
and Beats—for editing 
the music so you can 
reference musical time.
P Note: Ripple Delete 
removes the selected 
section of a file; in 
addition, the section 
to the right of the 
selection moves left 
to where the selection 
started, thus closing the 
“hole” left by deletion.

188 
Lesson 11 
editing Clips
Editing individual clips in the Waveform Editor
Although the Multitrack Editor has many useful editing tools, for detailed or 
unusual edits, it’s easy to flip a clip between Waveform and Multitrack Editors.
1 The bass slide starting at 6:3 is good, but the slide ends too soon. Shortening the 
bass slide and repeating it might sound more interesting, so start by trimming 
the bass note. Hover the cursor over the end of the first clip until the cursor 
turns into a red right bracket. Click and drag left to 6:4. This trims the last beat 
of the bass slide.
2 Choose the Razor Selected Clips tool or press R.
3 Position the Razor tool so that there’s a line at the beginning of the bass slide at 
6:3, and then click to split the bass note from the rest of the clip.
4 Choose the Move tool or press V.
5 Alt-click (Option-click) the name header at the top of the bass slide clip you just 
split, and drag right so that the copied clip starts at measure 6:4.
6 Place the playhead around the beginning of measure 6, and then click Play to 
hear the result of the two bass parts playing in a row.
That’s more interesting, but let’s make it even more interesting by processing the 
second slide independently from the first slide. However, a copied clip defaults 
to referencing the original clip, so any change you make to either clip changes 
both clips.
7 To convert the second slide into a unique clip, right-click (Control-click) the 
second slide and choose Convert To Unique Copy. Although the unique copy 
takes up additional disk space, you can edit it without affecting any other clips. 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 189
8 Click the Waveform Editor button to edit the second slide. 
9 Choose Edit > Select > Select All or press Ctrl+A (Command+A).
10 Choose Effects > Reverse to play the bass slide backward, so it slides up instead 
of down.
11 Click the Multitrack Editor button to return to the Multitrack Session. The 
reversed section will default to being selected, so click anywhere in Track 1 
other than the selected section to deselect it.
12 Position the playhead around the beginning of measure 6, and then click Play to 
hear how the two slides sound when played together. Keep the project open for 
the next lesson.
panning individual clips
Although Lesson 14, “Automation,” covers clip automation in detail, now is an 
appropriate time to introduce the subject by altering the stereo position of the two 
bass clips. Let’s take the bass processing one step further with panning, which is 
the process of altering a sound’s position in the stereo field (left, right, center, or 
anywhere in between).
1 For each bass slide clip (forward and backward), click the right and left ends of 
the blue Pan line (just inside the clip edges) to create control points at the Pan 
line ends. 
2 Click the first bass slide’s left control point, and drag it all the way down. Then 
click the right control point and drag it all the way up. Click on the second bass 
slide’s left control point and drag it all the way up, and then click on the right 
control point and drag it all the way down. 
3 Position the playhead near the beginning of measure 6, and then click Play to 
hear how the two slides move in the stereo field.
Combining Ripple delete and crossfading
The file still needs one more ripple edit, but that would remove part of the audio 
that’s worth keeping. However, it’s possible to use crossfading to compensate for 
deletions caused by the effects of a ripple edit.

190 
Lesson 11 
editing Clips
1 Change the Time Display to Decimal, and note that the file still needs to be a 
little shorter. Change the Time Display back to Bars and Beats for editing.
2 Position the playhead at measure 7 and click Play. The music gets a little quieter 
at measure 9, but then there’s an interesting harmonic note at 10:3. So, using the 
Time Selection tool, select 8:3 to 10:3 and do a ripple delete, as in step 7 at the 
beginning of the “Editing for Length” section.
Although a ripple delete removes audio, you can use crossfading to alter the clip 
length and reintroduce some of the audio that was deleted—yet still not add to 
the total length.
3 Position the playhead just before the previous transition, and then click Play. 
The transition sounds OK, but originally there was a nice little drum fill in the 
two beats before 10:3. Now the fill is gone because it was in the section that was 
subjected to the ripple delete. You can reintroduce them. 
4 To restore the drum fill, trim the clip starting at 8:3 and make it longer by 
hovering the cursor over the left edge of the clip until it turns into a red left 
bracket. Click and drag left to 8:1. Now the section with the drum fill has been 
crossfaded with the end of the preceding clip.
Using global clip stretching to make 
fine length adjustments
Global clip stretching can stretch all clips proportionately to fine-tune their total, 
combined length. Although extreme amounts of stretching can sound unnatural, 
relatively small changes alter the sound quality imperceptibly, if at all.
1 Change the Time Display to Decimal; as luck would have it, the music is just a little 
over 30 seconds—very close to the goal. So, use global clip stretching to reduce the 
length slightly. Begin by pressing Ctrl+A (Command+A) to select all clips.
2 Click the Global Clip Stretching button (to the immediate left of the snap 
function’s magnet icon). 
P Note: When you 
trim a clip using the 
trim handles, you have 
not permanently altered 
the clip but merely 
changed how Audition 
plays back the clip in 
RAM. You can always 
re-trim to go back to 
the original length or a 
different length.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 191
3 Zoom in so you can see the difference clearly between where the music ends 
and the 30-second mark. Click on the white stretch triangle toward the upper 
right of the clip, just below the name heading, and drag left until the end of the 
audio snaps to exactly 30 seconds. 
All clips have been stretched proportionately so that the audio track is now 
30 seconds long.
4 Position the playhead at the beginning of the file, and then click Play to listen to 
the entire 30-second music bed.
Clip edits: split, trim, volume
Digital audio editing allows for sound-warping options that would be difficult or 
even impossible to implement in any other way. Several of these involve isolating 
specific sections of a clip and processing them individually; the Split function is 
ideal for doing this. However, this lesson also employs other editing techniques to 
alter a clip.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson11 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session StutterEdits.sesx from the StutterEdits folder.
2 Place the playhead at the beginning of the file, and click the Transport Play 
button to hear the BoringDrums clip. 
3 Right-click (Control-click) on the timeline and choose Time Display > Bars 
and Beats. 
4 Right-click (Control-click) on the timeline and choose Time Display > Edit 
Tempo. Enter 100 in the Tempo field, and then click OK.
5 Choose Edit > Snapping > Snap to Rule (Fine). Because you’ll be zooming in 
quite a bit during this lesson, “fine” snapping will allow for snapping to finer 
resolutions, like eighth notes.
6 Click the Transport Loop Playback button.
7 Having two 16th note kick drum hits at the end would make a better lead-in 
back to the beginning. To isolate a kick drum, zoom in until you can see both 
1:3.00 and 1:3.04 in the timeline.
8 Choose the Time Selection tool or press T.
9 Click at 1:3.00 and drag right to 1:3.04. Because Fine snapping was selected, 
the selection should snap to these times on the timeline. This selects the kick 
drum hit.

192 
Lesson 11 
editing Clips
10 Choose Clip > Split.
11 Go to the end of the clip, and use the Trim tool to bring the end from 3:1.00 
to 2:4.08.
12 To make a copy of the clip, Alt-click (Option-click) on the isolated kick hit’s 
name heading, and then drag right until the kick clip’s left edge snaps to the end 
of the clip.
13 Alt-click (Option-click) on the name heading of the kick hit you just moved, 
and then drag right until the newly copied kick clip’s left edge snaps to the end 
of the previously copied kick hit. There should now be two kick hits between 
2:4.08 and 3:1.00.
14 If necessary, click outside of any selected area so it won’t loop, and then click 
Play. You’ll now hear the clip with the double kick lead-in at the end.
15 Now add some dynamics by making the first copied kick hit a little softer. Click 
on the clip’s yellow volume line, and then drag down to around -9dB. Click Play 
to hear how the two kicks have become more dynamic.
stutter edits
“Stutter” edits, which are commonly used in a variety of pop music, including 
dance music and hip-hop, slice and dice clips into pieces and then reassemble them 
in a different and usually rhythmic order. This lesson shows you how to “stutter 
edit” a hi-hat hit.
1 Similarly to how you isolated the kick by splitting the clip, zoom in with the 
Time Selection tool still selected, click on 1:4:08, drag to 1:4:10, and then choose 
Clip > Split to isolate the hi-hat.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 193
2 Trim the portion of the clip to the right of the hi-hat so that it starts at 2:1.00 
instead of 1:4.10.
3 Alt-click (Option-click) and drag the isolated hi-hat four times so there are four 
hi-hat hits between 1:4.08 and 2:1.00 (starting at 1:4.10, 1:4.12, and 1:4.14).
4 For a crazy stereo effect, click on the first of the four hi-hat hit’s blue pan line, 
and drag all the way up to L100. Click on the second of the four hi-hat hit’s blue 
pan line, and drag up to L32.2. Click on the third hi-hat hit’s blue pan line, and 
drag up to R32.2. Click on the fourth hi-hat hit’s blue pan line, and drag up to 
R100. Click Play to hear how this affects the loop.
Adding effects to individual clips
Although adding effects to an entire track is convenient for making sweeping real-
time changes, it’s also possible to apply one or more effects to an individual clip, no 
matter how short it is.
1 To add an effect to individual clips, let’s put a big reverb on the snare that hits at 
1:4.00. To do this, isolate the snare; click at 1:4.0, drag to 1:4.08, and then choose 
Clip > Split.
2 Click the Effects Rack tab if needed, and then click the Clip Effects tab. With the 
isolated snare clip still selected, click the right arrow in the Clip Effects’ Insert 1 
slot, and choose Reverb > Studio Reverb.
3 In the Studio Reverb dialog box, select Drum Plate (large) from the Presets 
menu, and change the Wet slider to 50. Now when the drum loop plays, the 
snare will have reverb on it.
4 Suppose you like the reverb so much you wish all the snare hits had it. Simply 
copy it three times (Alt-click [Option-click] on the clip name, and then drag) so 
that the start of this clip snaps to 1:2.00, 2:2.00, and 2:4.00. Because the snare hit is 
“on top” of the clip below, it will play back instead of what’s in the clip underneath.
5 If you’re not sure whether you like having the reverb effect on all snare hits, 
there’s an easy way to try different options. For example, if you want to hear 
what the loop sounds like without the reverb effect on the first and third snare 
hits, right-click (Control-click) on the first snare hit (the one that starts at 
1:2.00) and choose Send Clip to Back. Next, right-click (Control-click) on the 
third snare hit (that starts at 2:2.00) and choose Send Clip to Back. Leave this as 
E Tip: It’s possible to 
play a clip on top and 
the clip underneath 
it simultaneously 
by choosing Edit > 
Preferences > Multitrack 
and selecting “Play 
overlapped portions 
of clips.”

Lesson 11 
editing Clips
is for now, but if you want the snares to come back, you just need to right-click 
(Control-click) on the clip covering the snare, and choose Send Clip to Back. 
Remember that with layered clips, the upper layer on top has priority over the 
one underneath (unless you selected “Play overlapped portions of clips” after 
choosing Edit > Preferences > Multitrack).
6 Bounce all these clips to a new track so that all these changes are consolidated 
into a single file. Right-click (Control-click) in the selected track, and choose 
Bounce to New Track > Selected Track. (If there was other material in this track 
you didn’t want to bounce, you could select only these clips and choose Bounce 
to New Track > Selected Clips Only.) A new file appears in the track below that 
incorporates all your edits.
7 Keep the project open in preparation for the next lesson.
Extending a clip via looping
Any clip can be turned into a loop and extended for as many iterations as desired 
using the following procedure.
1 To convert the bounced clip created in the previous lesson to a loop, first verify 
that the clip start and loop end points are snapped exactly on measure or beat 
boundaries. If a clip is slightly short or long, any errors will accumulate as you 
create more iterations of the loop.
2 Right-click (Control-click) anywhere in the clip (except for a fade control 
square, Volume automation line, or Pan automation line) and choose Loop. 
A small loop icon appears in the clip’s lower left.
3 Position the cursor over the clip’s right edge. It turns into the Trim tool (red 
right bracket) but also shows a loop symbol. Drag right to extend the clip for the 
desired length. A vertical dashed line indicates the end of one iteration and the 
beginning of another.
P Note: The Volume 
control for the track 
being bounced and 
the Master Output 
bus Volume control 
will affect the level of 
the bounced track. 
For example, if either 
control is set to -3dB, 
the bounced track will 
be 3dB lower in volume 
than the original track 
with the edits.
E Tip: To extend a clip 
earlier compared to 
where it starts, you can 
click on the left edge 
and drag to the left.

Review questions
1 When crossfading clips to create a DJ mix, aside from having a common tempo, 
what else is extremely important?
2
What is a ripple delete?
3
How do you apply an effect to something like a single drum hit?
4
What’s the solution if snapping doesn’t seem to work?
5
How can all clips be stretched proportionately to shorten or lengthen a piece of music?
Review answers
1 Make sure clips snap precisely to the beat. Otherwise, the clips can be out of sync with 
each other during the crossfaded section.
2 A ripple delete removes a selected section of a file; in addition, the section to the right 
of the selection moves left to where the selection started, which closes the “hole” left 
by the deletion.
3 Isolate the hit by splitting it into a separate clip, and then insert an effect for only 
that clip.
4 Zoom in further for higher resolution; you might also need to select “Fine” snapping.
5 Turn on Global Clip Stretching, click on the right edge of the last clip, and then drag it 
to the desired length.

Creating MusiC with 
sound Libraries 
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Create music without needing to know how to play an instrument 
• Listen to clips in the Media Browser before bringing them into the 
Multitrack Session
• Modify clip lengths to add more variety to a composition
• Use files from a “music construction kit” to assemble music quickly
• Use pitch transposition and time-stretching to incorporate clips 
with a different native tempo or pitch than the current session
• Add effects processing to a track to complete the composition
This lesson takes about 60 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve cop-
ied the Lesson12 folder that contains the audio examples into the Lessons 
folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. Remember 
that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, because you 
can always return to the original versions by copying them from the 
Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.
12 

197
Using commercially available sound libraries and 
Audition’s Multitrack Editor, you can create music 
easily for commercials and audio for video, kiosks, 
and other applications—even if you don’t play a  
musical instrument. 

198 
Lesson 12 
Creating Music with sound Libraries
about sound libraries
Before computers, needledrop music often provided music for commercials, radio 
station breaks, and even some TV shows and movies. Needledrop music got its 
name because various companies produced sets of vinyl records with different 
types of music, sometimes classified by mood, and you would “drop the needle” on 
a suitable track for your background music. These records were usually expensive, 
and you needed to pay for a new license every time you wanted to use the music—
even if the same song was used twice in a single project.
Today, many companies make sound libraries available on CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, 
or via download that consist of musical fragments, loops, and sound effects.
You can assemble these various sound clips to create professional-quality, custom 
music. Sound library licensing agreements vary; many are royalty-free, but read the 
fine print to avoid potential legal problems.
There are two main types of libraries: Construction kits typically include fold-
ers, each with compatible files at a consistent tempo and key, which makes it 
easy to mix and match the files within the folder to create a custom arrangement. 
General-purpose sound libraries consist of collections of loops that are often 
themed (e.g., dance music, jazz, rock, etc.) but whose key and tempo may vary.
The Lesson12 folder contains a construction kit created especially for this book 
called Moebius, which contains 13 loops and a loop called Moebius Mix that  
provides a representative mix of these loops. The construction kit loops are all 
at 120 bpm and in the key of F#. Although this lesson suggests assembling the  
various loops in a particular manner, music is all about creativity; feel free to 
depart from the suggestions and create your own piece of music once you know 
how the process works.
getting started
Before assembling a piece of music, you need to create a Multitrack Session and 
listen to the various available loops to become familiar with the construction 
kit elements.
1 Open Audition, and click the Multitrack tab. 
E Tip: The Adobe 
Resource Central, with 
thousands of royalty-
free loops, sound 
effects, music beds, and 
more, is a great source 
of content for Audition 
CS6 owners. You can 
access it by choosing 
Help > Download 
Sound Effects and More 
and then following the 
onscreen directions to 
download the content.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 199
2 In the New Multitrack Session dialog box, enter Moebius as the Session Name. 
For Sample Rate, Bit Depth, and Master, choose 44100 Hz, 16 bits, and Stereo, 
respectively. Click OK.
3 Click the Media Browser tab, and then navigate to the Lesson12 folder. Click 
its disclosure triangle to expand it, and then expand the Moebius_120BPM_F# 
folder to show the files in the Moebius construction kit.
4 Click the Media Browser’s Auto-Play button. 
5 Click files in the Moebius_120BPM_F# folder to hear them play. Click the 
file _Moebius_Mix.wav to hear a representative mix of the various files 
playing together. 
6 Choose View > Zoom Out Full (All Axes) to see an overview of the tracks as you 
build the composition in subsequent steps.
7 Right-click in the timeline, and choose Time Display > Bars and Beats.
E Tip: To reveal the 
complete filename in 
the Media Browser, you 
may need to click on 
the divider between 
Name and Duration 
and drag to the right.

200 
Lesson 12 
Creating Music with sound Libraries
8 Right-click again on the Time Display, and choose Time Display > Edit Tempo. 
Confirm that the Tempo is 120 beats/minute with a Time Signature of 4/4 and a 
Subdivisions setting of 16. If any of these values differ, enter the specified values. 
Click OK.
9 Click the Snap button (the magnet icon to the Time Display’s immediate left) 
or type S.
building a rhythm track
Although there are no “rules” about creating a piece of music, it’s common to 
start with a rhythm track consisting of drums and bass, and then add other 
melodic elements.
1 From the Media Browser, drag the file Drums_F#L into Track 1 so its left edge 
is flush with the beginning of the session. 
2 Hold down the Alt (Option) key and click the clip’s name (Drums_F#L). Drag 
right to copy the audio clip, and release the mouse when the clip’s start is at the 
beginning of measure 5.
3 Similarly, create another copy so that the new clip copy starts at measure 9.
4 Create another copy so that the new clip copy starts at measure 13. There 
should now be four successive Drums_F#L clips in a row, lasting a total of 
16 measures (e.g., the right edge of the last Drums_F#L clip is at the start 
of measure 17).
5 Enable the Transport Loop button, return the playhead to the beginning, and 
click Play. The music should play through to the end and then jump back to the 
beginning and repeat. Click Stop after verifying this.
6 From the browser, drag the file Bass_Sub_F#H into Track 2 so the clip’s left edge 
starts at measure 5. 
7 Similarly to how you copied the drum file, copy two more iterations of the  
Bass_Sub_F#H so that the second copy starts at measure 9 and the third copy 
starts at measure 13. 
8 Because a constant bass part can get monotonous, you can trim some of the file 
so it drops out and let the drums carry the beat. To do this, hover the cursor 
over the right edge of the bass clip that begins at measure 5—in the part of the 
waveform just below the name—until the cursor turns into the Trim tool, as 
signified by a red right bracket.
9 Click and drag left until the clip ends at the beginning of measure 8.
P Note: Snap helps 
align the start of an 
audio clip to a rhythmic 
value. The resolution 
depends on the zoom 
level; for example, when 
zoomed full out, audio 
clips will snap to the 
nearest measure. Zoom 
in further, and they’ll 
snap to the nearest beat.
P Note: Adding more 
tracks increases the 
output level. You’ll 
probably need to scroll 
down to the Master 
track and reduce the 
volume to avoid the 
Output meters going 
“into the red.”
P Note: If you move 
the mouse after a 
clip has snapped to a 
rhythmic division, the 
clip may move off the 
rhythm. To make sure it 
has snapped properly, 
after dropping the clip, 
click on the clip’s name 
and move the clip until 
it snaps into place.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 201
10 Similarly, drag the right edge of the third copy left so that it ends at measure 16.
11 Add some variety to the drum track as well. Similar to how you shortened the 
bass clip, hover the cursor over the right edge of the last drum clip until it turns 
into a red right bracket, click, and then drag to the left to trim the clip so that it 
ends at measure 16.
12 From the Media Browser, drag the file Drums_F#H into Track 1 so the clip’s left 
edge starts at measure 16. Hover the cursor over the right edge of this drum clip 
until it turns into a red right bracket, click, and then drag to the left so that this 
clip ends at the beginning of measure 17.
13 Return the playhead to the beginning, and click Play to listen to the drum and 
bass tracks. 
14 The transition between the fourth and fifth drum clips seems a little abrupt. To 
smooth this, zoom in for a detailed view of the transition between the two clips 
at measure 16. Click on the fourth drum clip (the one that ends at measure 16) 
to select it. 
15 Hover the cursor over the right edge of the fourth drum clip until it turns into a 
red right bracket, click, and then drag right so that the clip now ends at measure 
16, beat 2 (shown as 16:2 on the Time Display if you’re zoomed in far enough). 
This will auto-crossfade the end of the fourth clip with the beginning of the fifth 
clip. Play that transition; it will sound much smoother.

202 
Lesson 12 
Creating Music with sound Libraries
adding percussion
Before moving on to additional melodic elements, let’s add a little light percussion 
to augment the rhythmic feel. 
1 From the browser, drag the file Seq_TunedNoiseSeq into Track 3 so its left edge 
snaps to the beginning of measure 5. 
2 Hover the cursor over the right edge of this clip until the cursor turns into a red 
right bracket, click, and then drag left so that the clip ends at the beginning of 
measure 7.
3 Hold down the Alt (Option) key, click the clip’s name, and drag right to copy 
the audio clip. Release the mouse button when the clip starts at the beginning of 
measure 9.
4 Hold down the Alt (Option) key, click the clip’s name, and drag right to copy 
the audio clip. Release the mouse button when the clip starts at the beginning of 
measure 13.
5 Hover the cursor over the right edge of this clip until the cursor turns into a red 
right bracket, click, and then drag right so that the clip ends at the beginning of 
measure 16.
6 Return the playhead to the beginning, and click Play to hear the music so far. 
After playing through the music, click Stop.
P Note: The file  
Seq_TunedNoiseSeq.wav   
doesn’t include a 
key because it’s an 
unpitched percussion 
sound.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 203
adding melodic elements 
With drums, bass, and percussion covered, you’ll now add some melodic ele-
ments. Because you’re already familiar with the process of dragging from the Media 
Browser, aligning clips to rhythmic divisions via snapping, and shortening clips, 
this process will go expeditiously.
1 Drag the file Pad_DreamyBrass_F#L into Track 4 so it starts at measure 7.
2 Drag the file Pad_DreamyBrass_F#H into Track 4 so it starts at measure 13.
3 Drag the file Organ_Church_F#L into Track 5 so it starts at measure 9.
4 Drag the file String_Harp_F#H into Track 6 so it starts at measure 11.
5 Drag the file Seq_Bouncy_F#L into Track 7 so it starts at measure 13.
6 Return the playhead to the beginning, and click Play to hear what you’ve 
assembled so far.
E Tip: If you minimize 
the track heights and 
choose View > Zoom 
Out Full (All Axes), you’ll 
see all the tracks and 
their associated clips. 
P Note: If you need to 
create additional tracks, 
right-click (Control-
click) in a blank space 
in the Multitrack Editor 
and choose Track > Add 
Stereo Audio Track.

204 
Lesson 12 
Creating Music with sound Libraries
using loops with different pitch and tempo 
The advantage of the construction kit approach is that files within the kit will have 
a common pitch and tempo. However, it’s also possible to use files with different 
pitches and tempos if they’re not too different from the current session—extreme 
changes can lead to an unnatural sound.
In this lesson, you’ll use a file in the key of E instead of F# with a tempo of 125 bpm 
instead of 120 bpm. It even has a different file format—AIF instead of WAV.
1 If you need to create a new track for another loop, right-click (Control-click) 
within the Multitrack Editor and choose Track > Add Stereo Audio Track.
2 Drag the file BeatFilter_E_125.aif from the Lesson12 folder into Track 8 or any 
empty track. It should start at the beginning of the track.
3 Return the playhead to the beginning and click Play. You’ll hear that this new 
clip is out of time and out of tune with the rest of the music.
4 To match the clip tempo to the Session tempo, activate the Toggle Global Clip 
stretching button (a clock with a double arrow underneath located to the left 
of the timeline). Then click on the white stretch triangle toward the right of the 
clip (just underneath the clip’s name header), and drag right until the end of the 
clip reaches the beginning of measure 5 (shown as 5:1 on the timeline). 
5 With the BeatFilter_E_125.aif clip selected, click the Waveform tab (pitch edits 
need to be made in the Waveform Editor).
6 In the Waveform Editor, press Ctrl+A (Control+A) to select the entire 
waveform. Choose Effects > Time and Pitch > Stretch and Pitch (process).
7 In the Stretch and Pitch dialog box, choose Default from the Presets  
drop-down menu.
8 Click the Advanced disclosure triangle. If necessary, select Solo Instrument 
or Voice, and deselect Preserve Speech Characteristics.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 205
9 The BeatFilter_E_125.aif needs to transpose up two semitones so that its key is 
F# instead of E (E-F-F#). Click on the Semitones field and type 2. Click OK. 
10 A dialog box warns you that this file is used in a Multitrack Session and 
will modify that session. This is what you want, so click OK.
11 When the file is finished processing, click the Multitrack tab to return to 
the Multitrack Session.
12 Click Play. BeatFilter_E_125 is now in time and in pitch with the rest of 
the music.
adding processing
The basics of the music are in place. You can now use some of the techniques 
described in Lessons 10 and 11 to modify the music further, such as change clip 
levels, add processing, alter panning, and so on. In this section, you’ll make the 
brass pad even dreamier with some echo.
1 Click and drag on the divider between Track 4 and Track 5, and drag down 
until you can see Track 4’s Effects Rack. Remember that the fx button in the 
Multitrack Editor’s toolbar must be enabled.
2 In Track 4’s Effects Rack, click insert 1’s right arrow and choose Delay and 
Echo > Echo. This turns the master fx button on automatically.

206 
Lesson 12 
Creating Music with sound Libraries
3 If necessary, choose the Echo’s Default preset from the Presets drop-down 
menu, and then choose beats from the Delay Time Units drop-down menu.
4 Set the Echo parameters as follows: Left Channel Delay Time to 2, Right 
Channel Delay Time to 3, and for both channels, Feedback and Echo Level 
to 80. Set all Successive Echo Equalization sliders to 0. Select Echo Bounce 
so the echo creates a wider stereo image. 
5 Click Play to hear how the echo affects the overall sound.
6 The second clip in Track 4 seems a bit loud. To reduce its level so it sits more 
in the background, click on the clip’s yellow volume line, and drag it down to 
around -5.5dB.

RecoRding in the 
MultitRack editoR 
lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Assign a track to your audio interface’s input or your computer’s 
default sound inputs so you can record into a Multitrack 
Editor track
• Monitor the interface input while you record 
• Set up the metronome for different patterns and sounds
• Record an overdub (additional part)
• “Punch in” over a mistake to correct it
• Record multiple takes and choose the best parts to create a 
composite track
This lesson takes about 50 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve  
copied the Lesson13 folder that contains the audio examples into the 
Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

209
In addition to simply recording into a track in the 
Multitrack Editor, you can also “punch” over mistakes 
and assemble multiple takes into an idealized,  
composite take. 

210 
Lesson 13 
Recording in the Multitrack editor
getting ready to record a track
You can record directly into the Multitrack Editor. For the purposes of this lesson, 
use any audio source that’s compatible with your audio interface—a microphone, 
a USB microphone that plugs directly into your computer, a musical instrument 
like a guitar or drum machine, CD or MP3 player output, and so on. Start with 
a new Multitrack Session.
1 With Audition open, choose File > New > Multitrack Session or press Ctrl+N 
(Command+N), name the Session Recording, and choose the template Empty 
Stereo Session. Click OK.
2 Choose Multitrack > Track > Add [Mono or Stereo, depending on the source]. 
For example, if you’re recording a voice, that would require a Mono track. 
However, most drum machines have stereo outputs, so if you were recording a 
drum machine to lay down a rhythm part, you’d choose a Stereo audio track.
3 From the Multitrack Editor four-button main toolbar, choose the Inputs/
Outputs area for the newly created track, and extend the track height so you 
can see the Input and Output fields.
4 The input defaults to the Default Stereo Input, as described in Lesson 1, “Audio 
Interfacing.” Verify that your signal source is plugged into the correct default 
hardware input. If it is plugged into an input that is not the default input, you 
can change the default using the Input field drop-down menu (also described 
in Lesson 1).
5 The output will default to the Master track output bus. If for any reason you 
want to bypass the Master track output and send the input directly to an audio 
interface hardware output, choose the appropriate Mono or Stereo output from 
the Output field drop-down menu. 
6 Click the track’s Arm for Record (R) button and play your audio source. The 
track meter should indicate signal level. Like most recording software, you’ll 
need to adjust levels at the audio source or with your interface; there is no 
internal input level adjustment within Audition. Make sure that with the loudest 
anticipated signal, the meter does not go into the red.
P Note: The Input field 
arrow points inward 
toward the Multitrack 
Editor; the Output 
field arrow points 
outward, away from the 
Multitrack Editor.
P Note: If you add a 
Mono track, the input 
will nonetheless show 
Default Stereo Input. 
However, the default 
input will actually be 
the left channel, or 
lower-numbered input, 
of a stereo pair. For 
example, if your default 
stereo input is called 
1+2, with a Mono track 
the default input will 
be 1.
P Note: Because 
the track’s output is 
assigned to the Master 
track output bus, you 
should also see signal 
level in the Master 
bus meter.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRooM in A book 211
7 Click the Monitor Input button. The input signal will pass through Audition 
and to the default output. With slower computers, this may result in latency—
an audible delay between what you’re hearing compared to the input. For 
information on minimizing latency, refer to Lesson 1. 
8 Keep this project open in preparation for the next lesson.
Setting up the metronome
The metronome helps you record by providing a rhythmic reference during the 
recording process. The metronome signal is not recorded into any track but is 
routed directly to the Master track output bus so you can hear it.
1 Click the Toggle Metronome button to the left of the timeline. The metronome 
track appears above any audio tracks, but it can be moved within a project, like 
any other track.
2 Click Play and you’ll hear the metronome signal.
3 You can modify which sounds play on which beats. Right-click (Control-click) on 
the Toggle Metronome button and choose Edit Pattern to define a rhythmic pattern. 

212 
Lesson 13 
Recording in the Multitrack editor
4 The metronome plays four “clicks.” The default is a downbeat using one sound and 
three “subdivision” beats using a different sound (e.g., TICK - tock - tock - tock). 
However, clicking on any beat square (labeled 1–4) cycles through four options 
for what that beat can play: Down Beat, Upbeat, Subdivision, or None. Click once 
on beat 3 to select None, and then click OK.
5 Click Play, and you’ll notice that the third beat is missing.
6 Right-click (Control-click) on the Toggle Metronome button again, and then 
choose Edit Pattern. This time click twice on beat 3 to select Up Beat (it will turn 
orange); click OK. Click Play, and you’ll hear a different accent for the third beat.
7 Return the metronome to the standard setting. Right-click (Control-click) on 
the Toggle Metronome button, choose Edit Pattern, and then click the Reset 
Accent Pattern button to the immediate left of the OK button. Click OK.
8 You can also change the metronome sound. Right-click (Control-click) on the 
Toggle Metronome button and choose Change Sound Type > [desired sound]. 
Sticks is the most conventional, followed by Cymbals, Kit, and Beeps; other 
options are available for more unusual sounds. Click Play after choosing an 
option to audition it.
9 After choosing a sound, adjust the Metronome Volume and Pan controls, which 
work identically to other tracks.
10 Keep this project open in preparation for the next lesson.
Recording a part in a track
Now that the levels have been set and the metronome is set up, you can record a part.
1 If necessary, return the playhead to the file start and make sure the track’s Arm 
for Record button is on.
2 Click the Transport Record button or press Shift+spacebar to begin recording. 
Several events occur:
• The playhead starts moving to the right and the metronome plays.
E Tip: If you can’t 
enable Arm for Record, 
it means no input is 
selected.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRooM in A book 213
•
The Transport Record button glows red.
•
The Arm for Record button remains off until the transport is stopped.
•
A red-tinted clip (the color indicates the clip is currently recording) shows 
the waveform being recorded.
3 When you’re finished recording, click the Transport Stop button.
4 Keep this project open in preparation for the next lesson.
Recording an additional part (overdub)
Recording an additional part is equally simple. This process is called overdubbing and 
is a mainstay of modern recording techniques. For example, a vocalist will often over-
dub an additional vocal part to create a thicker sound, or a drummer might overdub 
hand percussion parts (like tambourine) over a standard acoustic drum part.
1 Create a new track, select an input, enable Arm for Record and Monitor Input, 
and set levels as described previously.
2
Turn off the Arm for Record button on the previously recorded track.
3
Click the Transport Record button, and then click Stop when you’re done.
4
Close Audition; you’ll be opening a new project for the next lesson.
“Punching in” over a mistake
If you make a recording mistake, you may be able to edit it, for example, by finding 
someplace else in the song where you play the same part and then copying that part 
and pasting it over the mistake. But sometimes it’s easier and more natural just to 
play the part again. However, you don’t have to play the entire part; you can select 
only the section of the part with a mistake and record over that. 
E Tip: If you forget 
to turn off a previously 
recorded track’s Arm 
for Record button and 
accidentally record 
on that track, a new 
clip records on top 
of any existing clip. 
When you’re finished 
recording, simply 
click the accidentally 
recorded track to select 
it, and then press Delete.

214 
Lesson 13 
Recording in the Multitrack editor
As mentioned previously, although you’ll be punching in on a guitar part for the 
purposes of this lesson, use any audio source that’s compatible with your audio 
interface—a microphone, a USB microphone that plugs directly into your com-
puter, a musical instrument like a guitar or drum machine, CD or MP3 player 
output, and so on. The object is to demonstrate the process of punching more than 
to fix the guitar part.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson13 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session PunchingIn.sesx.
2 Click Play. Note the mistake between measures 4:1 and 5:1.
3 Enable Snap. Choose the Time Selection tool, and then click at 4:1 and drag to 5:1.
4 In the timeline, place the playhead before measure 4:1—for example, at the 
beginning or at measure 2:1.
5 Click the Track 1 Arm for Record button and Monitor Input, because you’ll 
want to hear yourself play the part you’re punching in.
6 Click the Transport Record button. Several events occur:
•
You can hear the previously recorded clip along with what you’re playing 
into the interface input.
•
Recording (“punch-in”) begins only when the playhead reaches the 
selection’s beginning.
•
While recording within the selection, the previously recorded clip mutes.
•
When the playhead reaches the selection end, recording stops (“punch-out”); 
you can again hear the previously recorded clip, and playback continues. The 
section that was punched in is tinted red until you click Stop.
7 Click Play. The punched part, being on top of the previously recorded clip, 
will play back and “cover over” the mistake. You can just leave it there or 
temporarily move it so you can remove the part with the mistake and replace 
it with the new clip.
8 Close Audition to start fresh with the next lesson.
E Tip: Because 
recording won’t start 
until the playhead 
reaches the beginning 
of a selection, you can 
start listening well 
before the punch-in 
point to get warmed 
up and play along with 
the track. Then when 
punching occurs, you’re 
already “in the groove.”

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssRooM in A book 215
composite recording
Some recording software allows looping a selection while in record mode so you 
can record take after take without stopping, and then choose the version you like 
best after you stop. Although Audition doesn’t have that exact function, it provides 
a similar option. The process is called composite recording because you composite 
several takes into a single, perfected take.
This lesson explains how to create several alternate takes and then choose the best 
one (or assemble parts of the best ones).
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson13 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session PunchingIn.sesx.
2 As in the previous lesson, enable Snap, choose the Time Selection tool,  
and then click at 4:1 and drag to 5:1.
3 In the timeline, place the playhead somewhere before measure 4:1  
(e.g., measure 2:1).
4 Click the Track 1 Arm for Record button and Monitor Input.
5 Right-click (Control-click) on the Play button and choose Return Playhead  
to Start Position on Stop.
6 Click the Transport Record button, and record something during the selection. 
This will be your first take.
7 After the playhead passes the selection, click Stop. The playhead returns to 
where it started.
8 Click the Transport Record button again, and record something during the 
selection. This will be your second take.
9 Click Stop. The playhead returns to where it started.
10 Repeat the previous procedure to create one more take (for a total of three). 
11 Click Stop, and then disable the Record and Monitor Input buttons.

216 
Lesson 13 
Recording in the Multitrack editor
12 Click the header in the clip on top of the original clip (take 3 in the selection 
area), and drag straight down to create a new track with only this take. 
13 Click on the next clip (take 2) in the selection area and drag down into another 
track, and then click on the next clip (take 1) in the selection area and drag 
down into another track. Now each take is in its own track.
14 With the selection you made back in step 2 still active, click on the original clip’s 
header (the clip with the mistake in it) to select it.
15 Choose Clip > Split to delete the section with the mistake.
16 Click the section you just split to select it, and then press Delete, or right-click 
(Control-click) on it and choose Mute.
17 Solo the original track, solo the track with the first take, and listen to how they 
sound together. 
18 Un-solo the track with the first take, solo the track with the second take, and 
listen to how they sound together. Similarly, listen to the track with the third take.
19 If you like one take best, drag it into place in the original track, and then delete 
the tracks with the unused takes.
20 If you like different parts of different takes, use the Trim tool to isolate the 
sections you like, and then drag them into place on the original track. Remember 
that if a clip is on top of another clip, the uppermost clip is what you’ll hear.
E Tip: If you can’t solo 
more than one track 
at a time, Ctrl-click 
(Command-click) on a 
Solo button to enable 
it in addition to other 
Solo buttons.
E Tip: To delete 
a track, right-click 
(Control-click) on an 
empty space in the 
track to be deleted, and 
then choose Track > 
Delete Selected Track.

Review questions
1
What is the disadvantage of monitoring the input signal through Audition?
2
Is clicking the Transport Record button sufficient to initiate the recording process?
3
What is the purpose of the metronome?
4
What is “punching in” and “punching out”?
5
What is “composite recording”?
Review answers
1 With slower computers, you may experience latency, where the signal you hear coming 
out of Audition is delayed slightly compared to the input.
2 No; you also need to arm at least one track for recording.
3 The metronome provides a rhythmic reference while you record.
4 Punching in initiates recording at a designated start point; recording stops at the 
designated punch-out point.
5 Composite recording involves recording multiple takes of the same part and then 
assembling the best sections into a final, composite take.

AutomAtion 
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Automate volume, pan, and effect changes within clips by using 
automation envelopes 
• Use keyframes to edit automation envelopes with a high degree 
of precision
•
Use spline curves to smooth automation envelopes 
•
Show/hide clip envelopes 
•
Automate Mixer fader and Pan control moves
•
Create and edit envelopes in the Multitrack Editor track Lanes
•
Protect envelopes from accidental overwriting
This lesson takes about 60 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve 
copied the Lesson14 folder that contains the project examples into the 
Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.
14 

219
Audition can remember parameter changes you 
make in a Multitrack Session and store those changes 
as part of the Session file—whether those changes 
are performed in real time as control movements 
or created/edited in non-real time. These automa-
tion processes can apply to individual clips or 
complete tracks.

220 
Lesson 14 
Automation
About automation
Automation records the control changes you make while mixing, including track 
parameters and effects. Before automation existed, if during mixdown you forgot to 
mute one channel at the right time or alter a mixer channel’s volume when needed, 
you usually needed to start the mix from scratch. With automation, not only can 
you record your mixing “moves,” you can edit them. For example, if a mix is perfect 
except that you didn’t mute a track in time, simply add the mute where needed.
Audition offers two types of automation in the Multitrack Editor: clip automation 
and track automation. The Waveform Editor does not support automation.
Automation can be recorded during recording or during playback; it is not neces-
sary to put a track into record mode to record automation moves. These moves 
are recorded as envelopes, which are lines—superimposed on a clip or track—that 
graphically indicate the value of the parameter being automated over time. There 
are multiple ways to create and edit envelopes, as you’ll see in this lesson.
Clip automation
Every clip includes two default envelopes—one for controlling volume, the other 
for pan. You can manipulate these envelopes to create automation within a clip. 
Later in this lesson you’ll learn how to automate clip effect envelopes as well.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson14 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session AutomationClip.sesx.
2 You’ll add a volume fade-in to the first clip in the Main Drums track. For easy 
viewing of the envelope, extend the track height and zoom in so the clip fills 
much of the window.
3 Note the yellow Volume envelope (currently a straight line) in the clip’s upper 
half and the blue Pan envelope that marks the clip’s middle. Click on the 
Volume envelope and while holding down the mouse button, drag down. The 
tooltip shows how much the gain is being reduced; this acts like a Volume 
control, because you’re changing volume for the entire clip. Because the object 
is to create a fade-in, drag back up so the tooltip shows a level of +0.0dB.
4 You can add control points called keyframes along the envelope to change 
the line’s shape. Click once on the Volume envelope around 3:1. This places a 
keyframe on the envelope. Click on the envelope again around 1:3 to create a 
second keyframe.
P Note: If you want 
to remove a keyframe, 
click on it to select it 
and press Delete, or 
right-click (Control-
click) on it and choose 
Delete Selected 
Keyframes. If multiple 
keyframes were 
selected via Ctrl-click 
(Command-click) or 
by selecting a string of 
keyframes by clicking 
at one end of the string 
and Shift-clicking at the 
other end of the string, 
deleting one keyframe 
will delete all selected 
keyframes. 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 221
5 Click on the second keyframe you made at 1:3 and drag it down and to the left 
so it’s at the clip’s beginning and shows a volume of around -14dB.
6 Start playback from the beginning of the song, and you’ll hear the drums fade in.
7 Suppose you want the music to fade in a little faster but not reach full volume 
until 3:1. Click on the line between the first and second keyframes, and then 
drag to around -3.6dB at 1:4. Click Play, and you’ll hear that the fade-in is a little 
faster at first and then fades in at a slower rate.
8 Now pan this clip so it starts in the left channel, moves to the right channel, and 
then ends up centered. Click on the blue Pan envelope at 4:2 to add a keyframe. 
This will be where the panning returns to center.
9 Click on the Pan envelope around 2:4, and drag all the way down so the tooltip 
shows R100.0.
10 Click toward the beginning of the Pan envelope, and drag all the way up and to 
the left until the tooltip shows L100.0.
11 Click Play, and you’ll hear the sound pan.
12 Make the pan a little more complex: Click on the Pan envelope around 3:3, and 
drag this new keyframe all the way up. Click Play, and you’ll hear the sound 
move from left to right, back to left, and then end up in the center.
13 The panning transitions seem a little abrupt because the lines change angles 
sharply at each keyframe. To change these angles into smooth curves, right-click 
(Control-click) anywhere on the envelope and choose Spline Curves. Now the 
envelope becomes similar to a “rubber band,” which allows you to click and drag 
to create any kind of curved shape you want.
14 Keep this project open for the next lesson.
E Tip: Hover the 
cursor over a keyframe 
to see a tooltip 
with the keyframe’s 
parameter value.

222 
Lesson 14 
Automation
move parts of an envelope or an entire envelope 
You’ve already learned that you can click on a single keyframe and move it around. 
However, you can select multiple keyframes and move them around as a group. For 
example, suppose you like the shape of the fade-in you created for the drums but 
want to raise the level of the entire envelope so that it makes for a slightly louder 
introduction before more clips start playing. Here’s how to do it.
1 Right-click (Control-click) on the Volume envelope you created in the first Main 
Drums clip to select it for editing. 
2 Right-click (Control-click) on the envelope or an envelope keyframe and choose 
Select All Keyframes.
3 Click on any keyframe, and drag up so the tooltip shows around +4dB. All the 
other keyframes move simultaneously.
4 You can also select particular keyframes and have those move together as a 
group. Click the clip outside of the Volume envelope to deselect all keyframes.
5 Click on the leftmost keyframe (the one at the beginning of the clip) to select 
it, and then Ctrl-click (Command-click) the second keyframe from the left (the 
one at 2:1). 
6 Click on the first selected keyframe, and drag up until the second selected 
keyframe reaches the top of the clip (you could click on either keyframe, but 
choosing the first one allows you to learn an additional characteristic of moving 
keyframe groups). The line defined by the two keyframes will move, and the 
nonselected keyframe to the right will remain “anchored.”
7 Keep moving the first keyframe up. Note that the second keyframe remains 
“stuck” at the top; however, it “remembers” its original position. Drag the first 
keyframe back down again to where it started (around -7.5dB), and the second 
keyframe will return to its original position.
8 Leave this project open for the next lesson. 
E Tip: If you click 
on a Volume or Pan 
envelope to select it, 
you’ll place a keyframe 
on the envelope. To 
select the envelope 
without adding a 
keyframe, right-click 
(Control-click) on it.
E Tip: To select a 
string of keyframes, 
click on the leftmost 
one, and then Shift-click 
on the rightmost one. 
Those keyframes and all 
keyframes in between 
are selected.
P Note: When you 
move a keyframe up 
or down within a clip, 
you cannot move it any 
farther than the clip’s 
upper and lower limits. 
When moving a group 
of keyframes left or 
right, you can’t move 
the group farther than 
the leftmost keyframe 
allows or farther 
than the rightmost 
keyframe allows.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 223
Keyframe hold
The Hold Keyframe option keeps an envelope at the current value set by the key-
frame until the next keyframe, at which point the envelope jumps instantly to the 
next value. Here’s how to use this effect to create abrupt panning changes.
1 Locate the first clip in the second track (Bass) and zoom in so you can easily see 
the clip and its automation envelopes.
2 Click on the Pan envelope just before the note that starts after 6:4 to create 
a keyframe.
3 Click on the Pan envelope just before the note that starts after 5:4 to create 
a keyframe. Drag this all the way down.
4 Click on the Pan envelope toward the left of the envelope, and then drag the 
keyframe to the upper-left corner.
5 Hover the cursor over the leftmost keyframe until you see the tooltip, which 
means you’re hovering directly over the keyframe. Right-click (Control-click) 
and choose Hold Keyframe.
6 Similarly, hover over the next keyframe to the right, right-click (Control-click) 
on it, and choose Hold Keyframe. The envelope now makes sharp, right-angle 
turns as the envelope jumps to the next value.
7 Leave this project open for the next lesson. 
Clip effects automation
In addition to volume and pan, you can automate the parameters of clip effects 
within the clip (see Lesson 11 for more information about clip effects).
1 Rather than working with the clip you just used to learn about Volume and 
Pan envelopes, you’ll use a different clip to learn about clip effects automation. 
Locate the clip in the Main Drums track that begins around 9:2 and select it.
P Note: A Hold 
Keyframe has a square 
shape, whereas a 
standard keyframe has a 
diamond shape.

224 
Lesson 14 
Automation
2 In the Effects Rack, click the Clip Effects tab. You’ll add a wah effect.
3 In the first insert, click the right arrow and choose Filter and EQ > Parametric 
Equalizer. Choose Default from the Presets menu.
4 Turn off all bands except band 2. Set its gain to around 20dB and Q to 
around 12.
5 Click the triangle in the clip’s upper right, and choose Parametric Equalizer > 
EQ Band 2 Center Frequency. This specifies the automation envelope that will 
be added to the clip.
6 An envelope appears and a small fx icon. Click on each end of the envelope to 
add two keyframes. 
7 Drag the left keyframe to the lower left until the tooltip indicates a frequency of 
around 100Hz. You may need to extend the track height to obtain the necessary 
resolution.
8 Drag the right keyframe to the upper right until the tooltip indicates a 
frequency of around 4000Hz.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 225
9 Place the playhead before the clip starts, and then click Play. You’ll hear a filtering 
effect that goes from low to high over the course of the clip. You may want to click 
the track’s Solo button so you can focus in on hearing the effect; keep the effect’s 
window open if you want to see the parameter change in real time. 
10 Leave this project open for the next lesson. 
Show/hide clip envelopes 
If you have lots of envelopes in a clip, the view can become cluttered. However, you 
can show and hide particular envelope types. Note that this changes the view for all 
clips in the project, not just a selected clip.
1 Choose the View menu.
2 Select the envelopes you want to see—Volume, Pan, or Effect.
track automation 
Track automation has some similarities to clip automation but is more flexible and 
applies to an entire track. You can work with track automation from either the 
Multitrack Editor or Mixer view.
For individual tracks, you can automate:
•
Volume
•
Mute
•
Pan
•
Track EQ (including all EQ parameters—frequency, gain, Q, and so on)
•
Rack Input level
P Note: When you 
select an automation 
envelope in a clip, the 
upper right of the clip 
header displays the 
name of the parameter 
it controls.

226 
Lesson 14 
Automation
• Rack Output level
• Rack Mix (crossfades between the dry sound and the sound processed by the 
Effects Rack)
• Rack Power
• Most plug-in parameters, including VST and AU-format plug-ins. For example, 
you could automate delay so that the delay feedback increases over a certain 
number of measures and then decreases.
There are three main ways to work with track automation:
• Move onscreen controls in real time and record the control motions as envelopes.
• Create an envelope, and then add keyframes to create an envelope shape.
• Combine the two—create the envelope with control motion, and then edit it by 
adding, moving, or deleting keyframes.
Clip vs. track automation
Given that you can automate volume changes with clip automation or track 
automation, sometimes you need to decide which to choose. The most important 
consideration is that you can create complex volume, pan, or effect changes within 
a clip, but then subject that to overall level changes using track automation. For 
example, you could apply clip automation to boost individual snare drum hits in a 
drum clip, and then use track automation to fade the overall clip in or out. 
Another major difference is that clip automation is part of the clip, so if you move the 
clip, the automation moves with it. If you move a clip that’s being automated by track 
automation, the automation will remain stationary. However, you can select multiple 
automation keyframes and move the envelope so it matches up with the clip you 
moved. In this case, it’s a good idea to put a keyframe where the clip starts or ends 
before you move the clip, so you have a reference point when you move the envelope.
Additionally, you can create track automation either by drawing and modifying 
envelopes or by moving onscreen controls. With clip automation, you can work only 
with envelopes.
What makes both clip and track automation so useful goes beyond being able 
to capture mixing moves like levels and panning, because automation can add 
nuanced expressiveness to electronically oriented music by automating signal pro-
cessing plug-ins. Also, note that you can edit automation data so you can tweak one 
parameter to perfection, then another, and so on.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 227
Automating fader mixes
In addition to automating using keyframes, you can take a more “hands-on” 
approach by automating mixing moves you make with the Mixer faders. 
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson14 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session AutomationTrack.sesx.
You’ll want to start the file from the beginning after stopping playback in most 
of this lesson.
2 To start file playback from the beginning, position the playhead at the beginning 
of the file, and then right-click (Control-click) on the Transport Play button and 
choose Return Playhead to Start Position on Stop.
3 With Audition open, click the Mixer tab.
4 Click the Main Drums track’s fader automation drop-down menu and 
choose Write.
5 Start with the fader for Track 1 (Main Drums) at around -18dB, because you’ll 
fade the level up.
6 Start playback from the file beginning. As the file plays, bring up the fader to 
around 0. Let the file play for several seconds, and then fade the drums out all 
the way.
7 Stop playback. Note that the Main Drums automation drop-down menu 
option changes automatically from Write to Touch. As you’ll see, this makes it 
convenient to fine-tune your fader moves.
8 Start playback, and the fader re-creates the fader moves you made. After the 
fader fades out, stop playback.
P Note: In Touch 
mode, any existing 
automation remains 
as is until you “touch” 
the fader (i.e., click on 
it) and move it. Then 
the new fader moves 
take over for as long 
as you hold down the 
mouse button. When 
you release the mouse 
button, the automation 
returns to any previous 
automation data. 

228 
Lesson 14 
Automation
9 Suppose you decide that fading out all the way wasn’t a great idea, and once the 
level starts fading out, you want the drums to fade back in again. You can always 
write new automation, but it’s easier just to “punch in” with the new automation 
move by using Touch mode. Start playback, grab the fader partway through the 
fadeout, and then fade back up to 0. Let the file play for a seconds, and then 
release the mouse and stop playback. The fader returns to 0, because that was 
the automation data prior to adding the new automation moves.
10 You can also automate panning. With the automation drop-down menu set to 
either Touch or Write, start playback and move the Pan control. Panning back 
and forth rhythmically will provide plenty of data to work with. When you’ve 
done at least several measures of panning moves, stop playback.
11 Now automate an effect. Expand the fx section by clicking its disclosure 
triangle.
12 In the Percussion channel’s automation drop-down menu, choose Write.
13 In the Percussion track’s fx area, double-click on the Echo insert to bring up 
its interface so you can modify its controls. Locate the 1.4k slider in the Echo 
effect’s Successive Echo Equalization area; that’s the one you’ll be altering.
14 Start playback from the file beginning, and move the 1.4k fader up to 
around 5dB.
15 The echo sound will start feeding back after a few seconds. Before it gets too out 
of control, pull the fader down to around -5dB to reduce the amount of echo 
feedback. Stop playback.
16 Start playback, and you’ll see the 1.4k slider re-create your mixing moves. When 
the mixing moves end, stop playback. 
17 When you’re finished making automation moves, change the automation drop-
down menus for the Main Drums and Percussion channels to Read. This will 
prevent accidental erasures or edits (Off ignores any automation data).
18 Keep this project open in preparation for the next lesson.
Editing envelopes
Although you can edit automation by using the Touch, Latch, and Write modes to 
make real-time edits, these automation moves also create envelopes that you can 
access and edit in the Multitrack Editor, similarly to how you edit clip envelopes.
1 Click the Editor tab.
2 Expand the Main Drums track height until you see the automation drop-down 
menu (which should show Read).
P Note: Another 
automation drop-down 
menu, Latch, is identical 
to Touch except when 
you release the mouse 
button from a control, 
the automation data 
does not revert to any 
previous automation. 
Instead, the automation 
envelope stays on 
the control setting 
that existed when 
you released the 
mouse button.
E Tip: You cannot 
automate the power 
state of individual 
effects in a track’s 
Effects Rack, but you 
can automate the track 
Effects Rack’s master 
power state. Turning 
this off when not in use 
saves CPU power. 
P Note: You can also 
automate Send level, 
pan, and power state. 
You cannot automate 
the Send Pre-Fader/
Post-Fader button.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 229
3 Click the disclosure arrow to the left of the automation drop-down menu to 
view the automation envelope Lane.
4 If you use lots of envelopes, showing them all simultaneously can clutter up a 
Lane. As a result, Audition lets you specify which envelopes you want to see in 
the automation envelope Lane. Click the Show Envelopes drop-down menu, and 
select the automation envelopes you want shown. Because you recorded both 
Volume and Pan automation, select those.
5 If multiple envelopes are visible, seeing all those keyframes in multiple 
envelopes can sometimes be confusing. Therefore, Audition lets you choose 
which envelope to edit (you can still see the other envelopes you’ve chosen to 
show, but you can’t edit them). Choose the envelope you want to edit in the 
Select drop-down menu. The chosen envelope will be highlighted, and the other 
envelopes will be dimmed.
Keyframes in track envelopes work exactly as they do in clip envelopes. For 
example, suppose your panning envelope doesn’t look smooth enough but more 
like an on-off switch. You can fix this with spline curves.
E Tip: If you’re 
interested in editing 
automation only for a 
particular parameter, 
usually it’s best to show 
only that envelope. 
However, sometimes 
two parameters are 
interrelated, and 
you’ll want to edit 
one envelope while 
referencing changes in 
another envelope. In 
these situations, being 
able to show multiple 
envelopes is ideal.

230 
Lesson 14 
Automation
6 Choose Spline Curves, and curves will form between the keyframes instead 
of straight lines. You can also delete selected keyframes to “thin out” the curve, 
either by clicking on them and pressing Delete or by right-clicking (Control-
clicking) on a keyframe or selected number of keyframes and choosing Delete 
Selected Keyframes.
Creating envelopes in the automation Lane
In addition to editing existing envelopes, you can create and edit track envelopes, 
as you did with clip envelopes. In this lesson you’ll create a precise, hard-limiting 
change to make the drums beefier when they first start playing, and then dial back 
on the beefiness when the bass starts.
1 Click on the Main Drums track’s Show Envelopes drop-down menu and 
choose Hard Limiter > Input Boost. As soon as you choose a new envelope, 
it’s automatically selected (you don’t have to use the Select drop-down menu), 
highlighted in the automation Lane, and set to whatever its current value is in 
the effect. The default Input Boost for the Hard Limiter is 0.0dB (no boost).
2 Because you don’t want any boost when the bass starts playing (at measure 5:1), 
click on the Input Boost envelope at 5:1. This places an envelope keyframe 
at 0.0dB.
3 Click on the envelope to the left of the keyframe you just added. Drag it up 
to around 20dB, and position it just before the keyframe that reduces the 
Input Boost.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 231
4 Start playback from the beginning, and listen to how this affects the sound.
5 Keep this project open for the next lesson.
Precision keyframe editing
In some cases, you might want to do precise keyframe editing. Selecting and delet-
ing can become tedious, so Audition includes four keyframe editing tools.
1 Select the Pan envelope, which presumably has multiple keyframes. 
2 Click the Next Keyframe button, and the playhead will move right from its 
current position to the next keyframe.
3 Click the Add/Remove Keyframe button (the diamond icon to the immediate 
left of the Next Keyframe button) to delete the keyframe. If the playhead was 
not on a keyframe, clicking this button would add a keyframe.
4 The Previous Keyframe button (left arrow icon) to the immediate left of the 
Add/Remove Keyframe button steps through keyframes from right to left. Click 
this button a few times to see how the playhead moves.
5 Click the Clear All Keyframes button (the eraser icon) to delete all keyframes for 
the selected envelope. 
6 Keep this project open for the next lesson.
Protecting automation envelopes
When you’re doing lots of complex automation, you want to avoid accidentally 
writing new automation where it’s not intended or overwriting existing automation 
(it can happen!). You can protect an envelope from these kinds of unintentional 
mistakes with a “write-protect”-like feature.

232 
Lesson 14 
Automation
1 Click the Protection button (the lock icon). The envelope dims to show it’s 
protected, even if it’s selected. Note that you can still edit it via the automation 
Lane when it’s protected.
2 In the Main Drums track, with the Hard Limiter Input Boost envelope still 
selected, choose Write from the automation drop-down menu.
3 Double-click on the Effects Rack’s Hard Limiter insert to open its user 
interface window.
4 Make sure the playhead is at the beginning of the file, and then start playback. 
5 Move the Hard Limiter’s Input Boost control back and forth. Stop playback; 
note that no change has been made to the envelope.
6 Turn off the Protection button, start playback, and then vary the Hard Limiter 
Input Boost control again.
7 Stop playback. Note that the Hard Limiter Input Boost envelope has been 
overwritten.

What is an automation Lane?
4
What is the difference between Touch and Latch mode for writing automation?
5
How does Audition prevent accidental editing of the wrong envelope?
Review answers
1 Clips cannot do mute automation.
2 A keyframe is a point on an automation envelope that represents a particular 
parameter value.
3 A Lane is part of the Multitrack Editor where you can create and edit envelopes for 
a track. Every track has a corresponding Lane.
4 After releasing a control in Touch mode, from that point on the automation returns 
to any previously written automation. After releasing a control in Latch mode, the 
automation envelope retains the last control value prior to releasing it.
5 Only the selected envelope can be edited, even though other envelopes are visible. 
You can also use the Protection button to prevent overwriting automation moves 
when recording automation.

Mixing 
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Use Audition to help test your room acoustics and determine its 
suitability for creating accurate mixes 
• Review tracks for glitches or other issues prior to mixing
• Change a song’s arrangement through mixing and remixing techniques 
• Optimize tracks to mesh well together using effects
• Take into account artistic considerations in mixing 
• Set up the mixing environment for an efficient workflow
• Use automation in the Mixer view to record and edit your fader, 
panning, and other moves as you perfect each component of a mix
•
Create clip groups
•
Add a fade-out using the Master Track
•
Export the completed song in a variety of formats
•
Burn an audio CD of the completed song 
This lesson takes about 90 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve 
copied the Lesson15 folder that contains the project examples into the 
Lessons folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. 
Remember that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, 
because you can always return to the original versions by copying them 
from the Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

Creating a mix is an art and a science. Audition’s 
Mixer view combined with automation, long-throw 
faders, the ability to detach the mixer and “float” it on 
another monitor, and various other crucial tools help 
create the mix. You can then save it in a variety of file 
formats (including MP3 for uploading to the web), 
as well as burn an audio CD of the final stereo mix.

236 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
About mixing 
After recording your parts and doing any overdubs, you’re ready for the next 
step: mixing and ultimately, mastering and publishing/distributing your project. 
Reduced to its basics, mixing simply means adjusting the levels, tonal balance, 
stereo or surround placement, and adding effects as needed to create a wonderful 
sonic experience.
However, part of mixing is making numerous value judgments. Which instrument 
should be most prominent at any given time? Do you want to mute some sections 
that seem redundant? Which is more appropriate—a raw, in-your-face sound or a 
smooth, well-produced sound? Do you want a massive guitar timbre or something 
that shares its space with other instruments? Who is your target audience?
How successfully you answer these types of questions determines the success of 
your mix. Mixing is a combination of art—being able to judge what sounds good—
and science, knowing what technologies and processes will produce the sounds you 
want. This lesson covers both aspects.
Note that there are as many ways to approach mixing as there are people who mix, 
so consider the information in this lesson as guidelines, not rules.
Testing your acoustics 
Any effort you put into mixing means nothing if your monitoring system—which 
includes your hearing, the room’s acoustics , the amp and cables that drive your 
monitors, and the speakers—aren’t accurate. If you’ve ever done a mix that sounded 
great on your system but sounded wrong when played elsewhere, you’ve experi-
enced what can go wrong with the monitoring process. A good mix should be able 
to “translate” over a wide variety of systems.
Fortunately, Audition provides tools you can use to do some basic diagnostic tests 
on your listening environment prior to mixing.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson15 folder, open the TestTones folder, 
and then open the file 100Hz_SineWave.wav.
2 Start with your monitoring system’s volume control full off, and then click the 
Transport Play button.
3 Slowly turn up the monitoring system’s volume to a comfortable listening level.
4 Walk around the room and listen. In an untreated acoustical space, there will 
be places where the sound gets louder and others where it gets softer. This is 
because the sound waves are reflecting around the room and interact with each 
other to cause peaks and cancellations.
E Tip: Placing large, 
acoustically treated 
tubes called bass traps
in the corners of a room 
can help even out the 
bass response.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 237
5 Now navigate to the Test Tones folder and open the file 1000Hz_SineWave.wav.
6 Again, walk around the room and listen. You’ll probably note that in some 
places the sound will become very quiet if you reach a “null point” in the room 
where the sound waves cancel.
7 Navigate to the Test Tones folder and open the file 10000Hz_SineWave.wav.
8 If you can’t hear this tone, consult an audiologist. Otherwise, walk around the 
room and listen. Because high-frequency wavelengths are so short, there will be 
even more peaks and cancellations than with the other frequencies.
Acoustics and hearing
The ear’s frequency response changes depending on the level. If you mix at too 
low a level, you might boost the bass and treble too much because the ear doesn’t 
respond as well as those frequencies. Mix at a comfortable listening level (which 
also reduces listening fatigue), and then check at both high and low levels to find a 
good average setting. Also, avoid mixing within 24 hours of taking a plane flight.
The room and speakers work as a team. Because the walls, floors, and ceilings all 
interact with speakers, it’s important that you place your speakers symmetrically 
within a room. Otherwise, if (for example) one speaker is three feet from a wall and 
another ten feet from a wall, any reflections from the walls will be wildly different 
and affect the response.
Near-field monitor speakers can reduce (but not eliminate) the impact of room 
acoustics on the overall sounds if placed around 3–5 feet from your ears with your 
head and the speakers forming a triangle. The reason is that the speakers’ direct 
sound exceeds the reflections coming off the room surfaces. As a side benefit, 
because of their proximity to your ears, near-field monitors do not have to produce 
a lot of power.
Headphones eliminate room acoustics but can give an unnatural sound when 
mixing, like exaggerated reverb effects. Many pros listen to mixes on speakers and 
headphones as a “reality check,” as well as different sets of speakers to hear what the 
music will sound like in different listening environments.
The subject of acoustical treatment deserves a book in itself; hiring a professional 
consultant to “tune” your room with bass traps and similar mechanical devices could 
be the best investment you ever make in your music. Meanwhile, you can find lots of 
educational information about acoustics in the Acoustics 101 and Auralex University 
sections at www.auralex.com.
E Tip: Acoustical 
diffusion and 
absorption panels 
can improve high-
frequency response 
and smooth out the 
midrange response 
to create a more 
accurate monitoring 
environment.
P Note: Even 
acoustically treated 
rooms will have some 
anomalies. The most 
important aspect to 
check is that you do 
not hear significant 
null points in these 
waveforms at your 
mixing position.

238 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
Testing for phase
Before doing any mixing, it’s good practice to make sure your system’s audio is in 
phase. For example, if the wiring to one speaker is reversed compared to the other 
speaker, its cone will push while the other cone pulls. This causes cancellations. 
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson15 folder, open the TestTones folder, 
and then open the file 100Hz_OutOfPhase.wav. Also make sure the file 100Hz_
SineWave.wav file is loaded in Audition.
2 Use the Waveform Editor’s drop-down menu to select the 100Hz_SineWave.wav 
file. Click Play and listen for several seconds. 
3 Use the Waveform Editor’s drop-down menu to select the 100Hz_OutOfPhase.
wav file. Click Play and listen for several seconds. If this test tone is quieter than 
the 100Hz_SineWave.wav file, your system’s stereo channels are in phase.
Creating your own test tones
The three test tones you listened to are fairly standard choices in terms of frequency. 
However, you might want to create your own test tones to test the low-frequency 
response of your speakers, the upper limit of your own hearing, how your room 
responds to frequencies other than the frequencies you just tested, and so on.
1 With Audition open to the Waveform Editor, choose File > New > Audio File.
2 Name the file 20Hz_LowsTest, choose the sample rate and bit depth (leave 
Channels set to Stereo), and click OK.
3 Choose Effects > Generate Tones.
4 Specify the test tone’s characteristics. The crucial ones are Shape (Sine), 
Modulation Depth (0), and Base Frequency (the frequency you want to create). 
Amplitude will typically be -6 to -10dB. Duration doesn’t really matter if you 
toggle the Loop button on. 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 239
5 Click the dialog box Play button to hear the tone.
6 Close Audition without saving anything in preparation for the next lesson. 
The mixing process
Mixing involves several distinct stages, which is what we’ll cover next. Again this 
is subjective view of mixing, but you’ll find most mixes proceed along the same 
general trajectory.
The project you’ll be mixing is intended to create background music for a 60-sec-
ond, narrationless kiosk video that will fade out at the end. You’ll be working with 
very basic tracks that you will arrange (“remix”) as well as do more traditional mix-
ing. Digital audio editors facilitate remixing where the mix engineer makes deci-
sions about not just the mix, but the arrangement as well. In addition to pop music 
remixes, this can happen with audio for video where, for example, a single piece of 
music is arranged for 15-second, 30-second, and 60-second spots.
Preparation
Before mixing, it’s important to do a little “mix environment housekeeping.”
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson15 folder, open the Mixdown folder, 
and then open the file Mixdown.sesx.
2 Right-click (Control-click) in the timeline and choose Time Display > 
Bars and Beats. 
3 Right-click (Control-click) in the timeline and choose Time Display > 
Edit Tempo. Enter a tempo of 128 beats/minute, with a Time Signature of 
4/4 and a Subdivisions value of 16. Click OK.
4 Right-click (Control-click) in the timeline and choose Snapping > Snap to 
Ruler (Coarse). Also make sure Snap to Markers and Enabled are selected, but 
deselect any other Snapping options for now. 
5 Arrange your workspace for mixing. The most important panels are the 
Multitrack Editor, Mixer (in the same tabbed frame), Effects Rack, Markers, 
Selection/View, Time, and Levels meters.
6 If you come up with a particularly good workspace for mixing, consider creating 
a new workspace. Choose Window > Workspace > New Workspace; when 
the New Workspace dialog box appears, enter the name Mixing (or a similar 
name), and then click OK.
E Tip: Being able 
to change the Base 
Frequency and then 
click the dialog box Play 
button is helpful for 
testing. For example, to 
check out a speaker’s 
low-frequency 
response, start with a 
Base Frequency of 50Hz, 
and then click Play. If 
you can hear that, enter 
40Hz and click Play; 
continue lowering the 
Base Frequency until 
you find the frequency 
where the speaker can 
no longer reproduce 
the bass. 

240 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
Reviewing the tracks
Before you start moving any faders, listen to each track in isolation in case there are 
any glitches, hum, noise, or other issues that need to be fixed prior to mixing. Using 
headphones for review can make it easier to hear subtle issues you might miss over 
big speakers.
1 Return the playhead to the beginning of the Session. Click the Solo button for 
the first track (Drums), and listen to it all the way through.
2 Because there aren’t any issues that need attention prior to mixing, return 
the playhead to the beginning of the Session. Deselect this Drum track’s Solo 
button, and click the Solo button for the second track (Bass). Listen to it all 
the way through.
The role of the producer, engineer, and musician
In professional situations, the musician is part of a team that includes a producer and engineer. In a 
project or postproduction studio environment, the musician often has to perform all three roles. It helps 
to be aware of the ideal role of each participant so you can assume these roles as needed while mixing.
The producer oversees the process, approves the arrangement, gauges the overall emotional impact, 
and makes artistic judgments about what does and does not work. To fulfill the function of a producer, 
you need to see each piece as part of a whole and each track as part of a final composition. If the 
producer knows the project’s ultimate goal, it’s a lot easier to create an appropriate mix. Don’t just mix 
your music; produce it.
The musician participates in the mix on any one of several levels, from simply observing the producer 
to making sure the production remains true to the original intent of the music.
The engineer is responsible for translating the producer’s needs into a technological solution. If the 
producer says the vocals need more “presence,” it’s up to the engineer to decide which tweaks will 
result in that particular effect. It can be helpful to adopt an engineer’s attitude when mixing; forget 
about whether you could have done a better solo and simply work with what you have.
A common mistake among inexperienced recordists is to overproduce. Sometimes tracks are best 
left unprocessed, and sometimes parts should be removed to create space for other parts. Keep your 
focus on the final result, not individual parts; if there’s a great guitar lick but it doesn’t support the 
song, mute it.
The fact that one person can write, play, produce, record, master, and even duplicate music is unique 
to modern times. But just because we can, does not mean we should. Human interaction can really 
enhance the creative process and provide the reality check that comes from a trusted associate who 
can provide honest, objective feedback from a second set of ears.

3 There’s a click at the beginning of measure 17 that needs to be eliminated. Drag 
the playhead to measure 17, and click Zoom In repeatedly until you can see the 
reason for the click. You’ll also want to extend the Bass track’s height.
4 There’s an abrupt transition at measure 17; adding a short fade can fix that. Click 
the Bass clip to select it, and then choose the Razor Selected Clips Tool from the 
top toolbar. Place it just after the abrupt transition, and then click to split the clip.
5 Choose the Time Select tool and click the left Bass clip. Click the Fade Out 
handle, and then drag to the left until around the next zero-crossing (i.e., where 
the waveform crosses the red centerline), as well as slightly down to a Cosine 
value of -25. 
6 Click the Zoom Out Full button, place the playhead before measure 17, click 
Play, and verify that the click is fixed. 
7 Continue soloing and auditioning each track to look for more glitches (spoiler 
alert: there aren’t any more) and also to become familiar with the tracks that 
make up the mix. Note that the tracks Wood Percussion, Bounce, Lead Synth, 
Lead Guitar, and Pad don’t make any sound until measure 17; to save time, you 
don’t need to listen to the first 16 measures.
8 Deselect the last Solo button you enabled. Keep Audition open in preparation 
for the next section.
P Note: If the Fade 
Out curve is set to 
Linear, hold down the 
Ctrl (Command) key 
while moving the Fade 
Out handle to toggle 
to the Cosine option. 
Either option will work 
in most situations 
requiring a fade, but 
Cosine can sound a tiny 
bit smoother.

242 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
Making arrangement changes
The lead parts start at measure 17, so the song can logically be divided into two 
sections. The first 16 measures lead into the song and build, and set the music up 
for the “payoff”—the lead parts that carry the song to the end.
Currently, the Drums, Bass, 12-String Synth, and Rhythm Guitar tracks all play 
continuously for the first 16 measures, which doesn’t build much. You can make the 
song more dramatic by modifying the arrangement so that the first 16 measures 
build over time. This involves value judgments about what would make the most 
effective beginning, so consider the following possible variation.
1 It’s always dramatic to have drums come in after the song has already started. 
Click the Drums clip to select it, and then position the Time Selection tool over 
the clip’s left edge so it becomes a Trimmer tool. Click and drag inward (right) 
to the beginning of measure 9.
2 The 12-String Synth part flows well and makes a good intro to the song. The 
bass seems sort of heavy, so you can delay its introduction for a more dramatic 
entrance. Click the left Bass clip (remember, we split it to fix a glitch) and use 
the Trimmer tool to drag the beginning of the Bass part to measure 5.
3 The rhythm guitar isn’t necessary yet, so click the Rhythm Guitar track to select 
it, and then use the Trimmer tool to trim its beginning to measure 9. Now it will 
come in with the drums.
4 Return to the beginning of the song, and then click Play to hear the song so far.
5 The bass comes in a little suddenly; it might be preferable to have a short 
lead-in. Position the playhead at measure 5, and then zoom in to see the first 
few notes in the beginning of the clip. Use the Trimmer tool to extend the 
beginning of the Bass clip back to measure 4, beat 3 (4:3).
6 Position the playhead before 4:3 and start playback. You’ll hear a slight click on 
the bass part at 4:3 because there’s an abrupt transition from silence to the bass 
note. Click the Fade In handle, and add a very short fade-in (e.g., don’t drag the 
Fade In handle any farther to the right than 4:3:01).

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 243
7 Most drummers use a fill to lead in to their part; unfortunately, no lead-in was 
recorded prior to where the drum beginning was trimmed. However, if you 
recall from listening to the Drum track, there’s a good fill starting at measure 16. 
Position the playhead just before measure 16, and then click Play to verify that 
there’s a fill there.
8 Let’s steal that fill and use it at the beginning. With the Time Selection tool, 
click the Drums clip to select it, and then click at measure 16 and drag right to 
measure 17 to define measure 16 as a selection.
9 Choose Clip > Split to isolate this selection, and then Alt-click (Option-click) on 
the Drum clip’s header. Drag the copy left so it starts on measure 8. 
10 To emphasize the last beat of the drum fill, use the Time Selection tool to create 
a selection from 8:4:0 to 9:1:0 (you’ll probably need to zoom in so that snap can 
be active for this). Select the 12-String Synth clip, and then choose Clip > Split. 
Click the header of the 12-String Synth note you just clicked, and press Delete. 
Now the 12-String Synth part is silent for the beat just before measure 9. 
11 Position the playhead back at the beginning of the song, click Play, and listen 
up to measure 17 or so. This arrangement is far better than just playing the four 
tracks at the same time—and nothing else (levels, panning, effects, etc.) has 
been adjusted yet.
12 Note that the Master Track Output is overloading. Now would be a good time 
to lower all the track levels before the mixing process actually starts, because 
doing a major level change while mixing might unbalance the mix. Click the 
Mixer tab in the Multitrack Editor frame, and set all the track faders to -9.5dB. 
Don’t adjust the Master Track Output Volume to compensate for the reduced 
level: If you want it louder, turn up your monitoring system’s level. You want to 
keep the Master Track Volume as close to 0 as practical and use it only at the 
end to make any final output adjustments (if necessary).
13 Click the Multitrack Editor tab to continue working on the arrangement.

244 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
14 Listen to the first 16 measures. Aside from the drum fill at measure 16, the parts 
are pretty constant from measures 9 through 17. This would be a good space to 
bring in short pieces of some of the later parts as “teasers.”
15 With the Time Selection tool, or by dragging the selection In and Out point 
handles, select all of measure 17. 
16 Click the Wood Percussion clip to select it, and choose Clip > Split to isolate 
measure 17.
17 Alt-click (Option-click) this isolated clip’s header, and drag the copy left so it 
starts at measure 11.
18 Create two more copies. Start one at measure 13 and the other at measure 15.
19 Start playback from before measure 11. You probably won’t hear the wood 
percussion part very distinctly, because the other parts are louder. These will 
become more prominent during the level-setting process.
20 Keep Audition open in preparation for the next lesson. If you want to hear what 
this arrangement sounds like, listen to the file SongArrangement.wav in the 
Lesson15 folder.
The brain and mixing
The brain is a dual-processing system. The left hemisphere is involved in more ana-
lytical tasks like setting levels and switching among various functions, whereas the 
right hemisphere handles creative tasks and emotional responses; it “feels” rather 
than “thinks” as it listens to the tracks. This relates to mixing because, in general, try-
ing to straddle the two hemispheres is not easy. However, if working with Audition 
becomes second nature, it will be easier to stay in right-brain mode. Audition has 
two features that help considerably—keyboard shortcuts and workspaces—which 
are both covered in Lesson 2:
•
Learn existing keyboard shortcuts, and create your own. After using them 
becomes ingrained, you’ll find it saves time to type a few keys as opposed to 
“mousing around.” 
•
Use workspaces to organize specific combinations of windows for certain tasks, 
like mixing, overdubbing, different types of editing, and so on. This requires less 
effort than opening windows and dragging them around.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 245
Optimizing tracks by using effects: drums and bass 
The first part’s basic arrangement is complete (notwithstanding any final tweaks 
you might make as the song develops further); you can change the second part’s 
arrangement during the rest of the mixing process. Next, you’ll turn your attention 
toward optimizing the sound of the various tracks with effects.
How you do this, as well as modify other aspects of the mix, will depend largely 
on the music’s intended application. If there will be a voice-over, the music will 
probably need to be more subdued to provide a “bed” for the voice. On the other 
hand, to accompany a kiosk video with no narration, you might want a more 
attention-getting mix.
1 Solo the Drums track, and then select measures 9–17 because all instruments in 
the beginning play in that section. Click the Transport Loop Playback button or 
press Ctrl+L (Command+L), and then start playback. The drums sound a little 
muffled and could use more “punch.”
2 Click the Multitrack Editor’s fx area. Click the first insert’s right arrow and 
choose Amplitude and Compression > Hard Limiter. From the Presets drop-
down menu, choose Default.
3 Increase the Input Boost to 6.8dB. Toggle the Hard Limiter’s power state button 
to hear how the processing gives the drums more presence and an “in-your-
face” characteristic.
4 Set the Effects Rack’s Mix slider to about 70%. This mixes in some of the more 
percussive peaks from the unprocessed sound with the hard limited sound. (If 
you can’t see the Mix slider and Input/Output controls and meters, click the 
Toggle Input/Output Mix Controls button to the right of the Effects Rack’s 
master power state button.)
5 The limiting brings out the cymbals a bit too much, and it would be good to 
have more “thud” with the kick. Click the Multitrack Editor’s EQ area; extend 
the Drums track height if needed to see the EQ area. 
6 Click the pencil icon to open the EQ’s interface. From the EQ’s Presets menu, 
choose Default. 
7 Enable the LP band, and choose 24dB/octave. For Frequency, choose around 
9200Hz. This tames the highs.

246 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
8 For more kick, set Band 1’s Frequency to 60Hz, Gain to 2dB, and Q to 2. 
The drums sound less thin and much beefier.
9 Now turn off Solo for the drums, and solo the bass. This instrument has the 
opposite problem: The bass is too aggressive and present, so you’ll make it 
smoother and rounder.
10 With the EQ area still showing, open the Bass track’s EQ section.
11 Enable the LP section, set Gain to 12dB/octave, and Frequency to about 700Hz. 
This reduces the brightness. To make the bass “rounder,” set Band 1’s Frequency 
to 50Hz, Gain to 2.6dB, and Q to 0.6.
12 Now solo the Drums so you hear the Bass and Drums tracks simultaneously. 
Turn off the Bass track EQ’s power state, and you’ll hear how the bass timbre 
gets in the way of the drums.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 247
Optimizing tracks by using effects: rhythm guitar 
The Rhythm Guitar and 12-String Synth complement each other. The Rhythm 
Guitar is more percussive, and the 12-String Synth is more legato. They’ll likely end 
up panned to opposite channels, but the guitar sound is too bland; it won’t hold its 
own against the 12-String Synth. You’ll use processing to fix that.
1 Solo the Rhythm Guitar track. It needs to sound more shimmering and bright 
but also less muddy—like the sound on the early Police albums.
2 Open the Rhythm Guitar’s track EQ from the EQ area.
3 Set the L band around 450Hz, Gain to -6.3dB, and Q to the more shallow slope. Set 
the H band around 860Hz, Gain to 4.7dB, and again set the shallow slope for EQ.
4 The EQ took care of the lack of brightness and excess bass. To add a 
shimmering, animated quality to the sound, click the right arrow in the first 
insert of the Rhythm Guitar track’s Effects Rack and choose Modulation > 
Chorus/Flanger. From the Presets drop-down menu, choose Default.
5 Change the Speed parameters to 0.1Hz, and Width to 30%.
6 Now solo the 12-String Synth and Rhythm Guitar. Having both of them play 
at the same time is somewhat cluttered, but this can be addressed with levels 
and panning.

248 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
Optimizing tracks by using effects: pads
A pad tends to be a fairly sustained, background sound designed to fill in some 
of the space in a piece of music and provide a “bed.” Pads can be bright and thin, 
bassy, mostly midrange, or whatever is required to fulfill their function. The pad in 
this song needs to be tamed, which can be done with EQ.
1 There are three background tracks featured in the second half of the song—
Wood Percussion, Bounce, and Pad. Solo those three tracks and nothing else.
2 Unsolo the Pad track, and note how Wood Percussion and Bounce sound much 
more percussive—the pad fills in the background too much.
3 Open the Pad track’s EQ from the EQ area. Turn of all Bands except HP (set it 
to around 300Hz with 13dB/Octave gain) and LP (set it to around 1700Hz, also 
with 12dB/Octave gain). Note how this makes the pad subservient to the Wood 
Percussion and Bounce.
Optimizing tracks by using effects: lead guitar
Two lead tracks remain, Lead Synth and Lead Guitar. Because they’re essentially 
doubling each other, it’s probably best for them to trade back and forth during the 
final mix. However, the Lead Guitar needs some serious processing in order to cut 
through the mix.
1 Unsolo all tracks and solo the Lead Guitar.
2 Click the right arrow in the first insert in the Lead Guitar track’s Effects Rack 
and choose Special > Guitar Suite. From the Presets drop-down menu, choose 
Big and Dumb.
3 Deselect the Filter Bypass. Change Frequency to around 1700Hz and Resonance 
to around 50%.

4 Click the right arrow in the second insert in the Lead Guitar track’s Effects 
Rack and choose Delay and Echo > Echo. From the Presets drop-down menu, 
choose Default.
5 Change Delay Time Units to Beats and select Echo Bounce. For the Left 
Channel Delay Time, type in 1.33 beats. For the Right Channel Delay time, 
type in 1.00 beats.
6 Toggle the Guitar Track Effects Rack’s power state button to compare the sound 
before and after processing. That’s quite a difference!
Setting up the mixing environment
Now that the sounds are dialed in, it’s time to set up levels and stereo imaging. 
Note that all of these edits are interactive: You might find while setting levels that 
you need to go back and tweak EQ on a track or delete a track altogether. 
1 Let’s create some markers so it’s easy to get around in the song. If any part of the 
song is selected, click in the waveform (outside the selection) to deselect it.
2 Place the playhead at the beginning and press M. In the Markers panel name 
this marker Start.
3 Place the playhead at measure 16 and press M. In the Markers panel, name this 
marker Solo Start. It’s set one measure before the solo starts on purpose, so you 
have a one-measure “count-in” before you reach the start of the solo.
P Note: If you find it 
difficult to place the 
playhead exactly on the 
measure, you can type 
in the desired value in 
the Markers panel Start 
field—for example, 
16:1.00.

250 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
4 Place the playhead at measure 24 and press M. In the Markers panel, name this 
marker Solo Halfway. Again, this is one measure before the actual halfway point.
5 Click the Mixer tab, because that environment is optimized for what you’re 
about to do next. Expand all the Mixer disclosure triangles, and if possible, 
expand the Mixer panel so you can see all tracks and the Master Track at the 
same time. 
6 Choose Window > Transport to make it easy to get around while in the Mixer 
environment. Docking it next to the Levels panel is one possible place to put it. 
Check that all the track levels are at -9.5dB (or -9dB; it doesn’t matter as long as 
they’re consistent) and the mixing environment is now ready.
E Tip: If you have a 
two-monitor display, 
you can float the Mixer 
to one of the displays 
while keeping the 
Multitrack Editor open 
in the other.

Setting levels and balance
Until now, all the tracks have been centered in the stereo field and all levels have 
been the same. Starting without stereo placement makes it apparent which tracks 
conflict with respect to frequency response; this might not be obvious when tracks 
are panned oppositely. In other words, if the music sounds “open” and distinct with 
all the parts centered, it will sound even more open and more distinct once you 
start working with the stereo placement. The reason for keeping levels the same is 
to establish a baseline level, which can then be altered during mixing.
You’ll start by mixing the introduction, in other words, the section up to measure 17.
1 Double-click the Start marker, click the Transport Play button, and just listen to 
the introduction.
2 Pan the 12-String Synth to around L88, and pan the Rhythm Guitar to around 
R88. These will “bookend” the centered Drums and Bass tracks.
3 Listen again. It’s good that the 12-String Synth starts off strong, because nothing 
else is playing. But it needs to come down a bit when the bass comes in and also 
because it will be too loud compared to the rhythm guitar when it enters. So, 
start playback, and when the bass comes in, move the 12-String Synth channel’s 
fader down to around -11dB (check the yellow number just below the fader in 
Mixer view) so it hits that level before the drums come in. Practice this “move” a 
couple times to get a feel for how the fader responds.
4 When you have the move down, write it as automation. In the 12-String Synth 
Track, set the Automation drop-down menu to Latch. You can then write your 
move, and when you stop, the level will remain at -11dB (or wherever you left it).
5 Return the fader to -9 or so, and click Play. Make your fader change at the 
appropriate time, and click Stop when you’ve completed the move. Change the 
12-String Synth automation drop-down menu to Read, so you don’t write new 
automation by accident.
6 Now automate the drums. They seem a little soft overall, so they should end 
up around -7.6dB. But they should also come on strong during the opening 
fill. Practice starting with the Drums track at -6dB and then bringing it down 
to around -7.6dB when the rhythm guitar comes in. Bring it up to -6dB again 
during the fill that happens at measure 16. Then reduce it to -7.6dB or so when 
measure 17 starts. Practice this move a few times.
7 When you’re ready, set the Drums track automation drop-down menu to Latch, 
and do your automation. Click Stop when you’ve completed the move, and 
change the Drums automation drop-down menu to Read.
8 Jump ahead to the two leads and let’s automate them as well, because the plan is 
to trade off between the two leads. Double-click the marker Solo Start.
E Tip: Remember 
that you can right-
click (Control-click) 
the Transport Play 
button and choose 
Return Playhead to 
Start Position on Stop. 
This can be helpful 
when you’re mixing 
the introduction and 
want to return to the 
beginning.

252 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
9 Pan the Lead Synth to R70 and the Lead Guitar to L70. The reason for this 
choice is so the Lead Guitar is in the opposite channel from the Rhythm Guitar, 
and the Lead Synth is in the opposite channel from the 12-String Synth. This 
helps differentiate the instruments.
10 Automate the Lead Guitar first. Start with it at around -4.4dB (after all, it is the 
lead). Then just before measure 21 starts, click the Mute button. Leave Mute 
enabled until just before measure 25, and then turn off Mute to hear the Lead 
Guitar again. Leave Mute off, because both leads will play at the end.
11 Practice this move until you have it down, and then set the Lead Guitar 
automation drop-down menu to Latch. Click Play and do your automation moves. 
When you’re done, click Stop, and set the automation drop-down menu to Read.
12 Now practice the Lead Synth automation moves. This time you can’t use the 
Mute button because the lead plays continuously. So, start with the Lead Synth 
fader all the way off, and then fade it from 0 to -3.9dB during measure 20. Bring 
it back down again at measure 25. At measure 29, bring it up to about -7.5—
loud enough to support the other lead but not compete with it.
13 Once you have this move rehearsed, set the Lead Synth automation drop-down 
menu to Latch, click Play, and do your automation moves. When you’re finished 
click Stop, and set the automation drop-down menu to Read.
14 Now try some dynamic automation with the Wood Percussion track. Leave it 
parked around -15dB when the leads are playing notes, but in the spaces where the 
lead note just sustains, bring the Wood Percussion up to around -3dB to add an 
accent. Perform the same routine as before: Practice, choose Latch, click Play, make 
your moves, click Stop, and change the automation drop-down menu to Read.
15 Bring in the Bounce track to support the Lead Synth track. Pan it opposite 
to the Lead Synth at L70. Leave it around -15dB, but bring it up to around 0 
whenever the Lead Synth is playing.
16 Double-click the Start marker, and listen to what you have so far.
17 You need to complete two more tweaks: Some Wood Percussion bits existed 
before the solo started, but you couldn’t really hear them. Set the Wood 
Percussion automation to Touch and the playhead back to the beginning of the 
song. Click Play, and then bring the Wood Percussion fader to -6. Leave it there 
until the solo starts, and then click Stop. Leave the automation on Touch.
18 Pan the little Wood Percussion bits in the beginning. Click Play, and move the 
Wood Percussion track’s Panner knob all the way to the left before measure 11. 
During measure 12, move the Panner knob all the way to the right. During 
measure 14, move it all the way to the left again. When the solo starts, keep 
moving it around to add some motion to the Wood Percussion part that plays in 
the spaces between solos.
P Note: If you don’t 
get your automation 
moves right or get 
them only partially 
right, set the track’s 
automation drop-down 
menu to Touch. Any 
new moves you make 
will overwrite old ones 
as soon as you click on 
the fader and revert 
to the older moves 
when you release the 
mouse button.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 253
19 Click the Multitrack Editor tab, and extend the Track Height of a track where 
there’s automation, like the Lead Synth part. The first time the volume was 
raised was a little too much, so in the Select field choose Volume (if it isn’t 
already chosen), click the first keyframe of the section you want to change, 
Shift-click on the last keyframe in the section you want to change, and adjust 
the level as desired by dragging the envelope down a bit. In some cases, this 
is faster and/or a more precise method than trying to repeat the automation 
moves in Touch mode.
20 After you’ve finished your mix, keep the project open because you’re about to 
get a phone call. 
Using groups
You’ve finished your mix, automated your moves, and played the song over the 
phone to the clients who commissioned the soundtrack. Then the phone rings: 
They love it, but the video was extended to 1 minute 30 seconds, so they ask if there 
is any chance you could add the last part using the song’s rhythm track, but without 
the leads, and have a long fade from 1:15 to 1:30?
In this situation you can separate just the section after the solo section begins with 
the Razor tool, group all the separated clips together except for the leads, and then 
copy the group to extend the song.
1 Choose the Razor Selected Tracks tool (or press R). 
2 Zoom in on measure 17 where the solo begins, and extend the height of one of 
the clips so you can see the waveform. The Razor Selected Tracks tool must be 
inside a waveform in order to snap.

254 
Lesson 15 
Mixing
3 Position the Razor Selected Tracks tool so you can see the line it creates 
at 17:1.00.
4 Press Ctrl+A (Command+A) to select all tracks. The Razor Selected Tracks 
tool will split any tracks that are selected.
5 Select the clips you want to group, either by drawing a marquee around them 
and/or Ctrl-clicking (Command-clicking) to add or subtract clips from the group.
6 With the clips to be grouped still selected, choose Clip > Group Clips. The group 
turns a different color, and each clip shows a group symbol in the lower left. 
7 Alt-click (Option-click) on a clip header, and then drag-copy the group to the 
current end of the song. Now you have a piece of music that lasts 1 minute 
and 30 seconds.
Adding a fade at the end
The easiest way to add a fade-out to the entire mix is to add Volume automation to 
the Master Track. 
1
Extend the height of the Master Track until you can see the automation lane.
2
Click the automation disclosure triangle to expand the list.
3
Click Show Envelopes and select Volume.
P Note: Groups can 
be treated like an 
individual clip. You 
can move, copy, paste, 
or delete a group. 
Each copy of a group 
has a unique color. 
Groups also act like 
an individual clip in 
terms of mute, lock, 
loop, and other clip 
attributes: Applying an 
attribute applies it to 
the entire group. You 
can also choose Clip > 
Suspend Group if you 
want to make changes 
to an individual clip 
within a group, such as 
when you drag-copy 
a particular clip out of 
a group. 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 255
4 Add a node to the envelope where you want the fade to begin, for example, 
around 15 seconds from the end. 
5 Add another node at the end of the song, and drag it down to 0.
6 Add intermediate nodes or use spline curves to shape the fade further.
Exporting a stereo mix of the song
Now that the song is mixed, you can export it as a stereo file in a variety of formats.
1 Choose File > Export > Multitrack Mixdown, and then choose either Time 
Selection (if you’ve defined what should be exported as a time selection) or 
Entire Session (from the start of the first clip to the end of the last clip). 
2 The Export Multitrack Mixdown dialog box appears. Enter a filename, the 
location where you want to save it, and the format.
P Note: Audition 
can export multiple 
file types, including 
WAV, AIF, MP3, MP2, 
FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, MOV 
(QuickTime, audio only), 
libsndifle, and APE 
(Monkey’s Audio).

Lesson 15 
Mixing
3 Click the Change button for Sample Type to change the sample rate and bit 
depth (resolution). Click the dialog box’s Advanced disclosure triangle to 
specify the type of dithering you want to use. Dithering can offset the effects of 
truncating bit resolution when converting from a higher resolution to a lower 
one, such as mixing audio recorded in 24-bit resolution down to the 16-bit 
resolution required by CDs. Enabling the default is the simplest option.
4 Click OK, and the song will be exported as a stereo mix to the specified location.
Burning an audio CD of the song
When you save a stereo mixdown, the file automatically becomes available from the 
Waveform Editor’s drop-down menu. You can then master it or burn the mix to an 
audio CD.
1
Choose the file using the Waveform Editor’s drop-down menu.
2
Choose File > Export > Burn Audio CD.
3
Insert a blank recordable CD in your computer’s CD/DVD writeable optical drive.
4
Click OK.
5
Choose the desired options from the Burn Audio dialog box.
6
Click OK, and your CD will be ready shortly thereafter.
E Tip: Under Mixdown 
Options, click Change 
and you’ll see a dialog 
box where you can 
choose to mix every 
track as its own file. 
This is a great way to 
back up a project or 
exchange a project with 
someone who uses 
a different recording 
program than Audition.

Review answers
1 You cannot produce a mix that will sound good over a variety of systems if the audio 
you’re hearing is not accurate.
2 Equalization (EQ) can prevent tracks from interfering with each other by restricting 
them to particular frequency ranges.
3 If you can get the tracks to sound separate when they’re all panned to center, they’ll 
sound even more open and separate when placed in the stereo field.
4 Volume automation in the Master Track makes it easy to add a fade-out to all tracks 
simultaneously.
5 When you do a mixdown of a stereo file, it’s automatically available in the Waveform 
Editor, from which you can then burn an audio CD.

Scoring Audio to Video 
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Load a video preview file into Audition 
• Analyze the video and alter Audition’s tempo to create “hit points” 
so the music closely correlates to the video
• Create a soundtrack music bed
• Add musical or sonic “hits” in musically appropriate places to 
accent the visuals
• Synchronize ADR (dubbed) dialogue with original dialogue
• Evaluate which type of dialogue synchronization provides the best 
audio quality
This lesson takes about 50 minutes to complete. This assumes you’ve cop-
ied the Lesson16 folder that contains the audio examples into the Lessons 
folder that you created on your hard drive for these projects. Remember 
that you needn’t be concerned about modifying these files, because you 
can always return to the original versions by copying them from the 
Adobe Audition CS6 Classroom in a Book CD-ROM.

259
Audition can load video preview files; when  
composing soundtracks or adding dialogue,  
the video window provides a crucially important 
reference.

260 
Lesson 16 
scoring Audio to Video
importing a video
When working with video, Audition can create a separate video preview  
track at the top of the workspace. If you import video that also includes an  
audio track, the audio will likewise be imported into Audition and placed  
in the audio track immediately below the video track. 
1 Open Audition and choose File > New > Multitrack Session.
2 Name the file Audio for Video. Choose None for Template, 44100Hz for 
Sample Rate, 16 for Bits, and Stereo for Master. Click OK.
3 From the Media Browser, click on the Lesson16 folder and then open the 
folder Audio for Video Files and drag the file Promo.mp4 into the beginning 
of Track 1. This creates a video track automatically, as well as opens a Video 
panel where you can see the video. You may want, or need, to resize the 
Video panel to see the entire video. (Note: The video file is provided courtesy 
of HarmonyCentral.com.)
using markers to create hit points
The process of creating a soundtrack typically involves more than just throwing 
some library music into a couple of tracks and hoping that it matches the video. 
Sound libraries make it easy to create your own music; even if you consider yourself 
a “video” person instead of a musician, you might be surprised at how easily you 
can create a soundtrack, and with a little extra effort, customize the music to cor-
relate to what’s happening onscreen. 
One way to create this correlation is to identify places in the video where there 
are important transitions or events and then try different tempos to see which one 
allows the music to match these “hit points” best.
1 Right-click (Control-click) in the timeline and choose Time Display > Decimal.
P Note: Audition 
recognizes the following 
video formats: AVI, DV, 
MOV, MPEG-1, MPEG-4, 
3GPP, and 3GPP2. 
Audition is not a video 
editor and cannot edit 
the video preview; any 
video edits need to 
be done in a program 
like Adobe Premiere 
Pro prior to loading 
the file into Audition. 
However, its start point 
can be moved within the 
video track.
E Tip: You can right-
click (Control-click) in 
the Video panel and 
choose five different 
scaling options 
and three different 
resolutions. Best Fit 
Scaling is usually the 
optimal choice, because 
the video size will 
conform to the size of 
the panel. 

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 261
2 Start playback from the beginning of the video. When there’s a major transition 
in the video, press M to place a marker in the timeline and create a location point 
to aid you in placing musical effects (often called a “hit point”). For example, one 
point would be just before “the world’s largest music show.” Others would be 
just before “live updates from the show floor,” “daily highlight videos,” “dedicated 
discussion forum,” “press release central,” and just before “...and more.” 
3 Now fine-tune the placement of the location points, because there will always 
be a slight lag between the time you view something onscreen and the time you 
press M. Fortunately, except at the first hit point area, the video has a white 
flash screen just before these important transitions. Drag the current time 
indicator (CTI, or playhead) to just before “the world’s largest music show,” and 
then drag Marker 01 to align with it. 
4 Drag the CTI until it lands on the white frames just before “live updates from 
the show flow.” Drag Marker 02 to align with the CTI.
5 Follow the same procedure to position the markers at the remaining white 
frames before the transition points.
6 Click on the Markers panel (choose Window > Markers if it’s not visible). You 
should see markers at approximately 0:05.549, 0:09.478, 0:13.455, 0:16.701, 
0:20.104, and 0:23.664. These values don’t have to be exact as long as the last five 
markers are where the video shows a white flash. Double-click on each marker 
in the Markers panel to verify this.

Lesson 16 
scoring Audio to Video
7 Right-click (Control-click) the timeline and choose Bars and Beats; then right-
click (Control-click) the timeline and choose Edit Tempo. Enter 100BPM to 
start, and then click OK.
8 Look at the extent to which the markers align with the tempo. Two fall on 
measure boundaries, but the rest fall in several places that have little to do with 
the tempo. You’ll need to find a better match. 
9 Change Edit Tempo to 130BPM. This tempo works quite well—Markers 01, 
04, and 05 are very close to a measure boundary. Markers 02 and 06 are quite 
close, too. The one that’s still off a bit is Marker 03, but because the hit point 
occurs slightly after the measure boundary, you could add a sound that starts 
on the beat and builds slightly to the hit point. So, 130BPM is a good tempo for 
the video and fits the video’s theme as well—it’s upbeat and danceable. Note 
that finding hit points sometimes involves trial and error; you may need to try 
several different tempos before finding one that “fits.”
10 Keep this project open in preparation for the next lesson.
don’t forget video for audio
The term “audio for video” recognizes the reality that most of the time audio is 
added to existing video. However, if you have some degree of control over the audio 
and video process, sometimes it makes more sense to compose the music first and 
then lay video on top of the audio. 
This is particularly true for videos that aren’t critically dependent on timing. Kiosk 
videos, some ads, trailers, and promos are often fairly flexible in the way that video 
needs to be presented, and cutting it to the audio can simplify matters considerably.
But does the music matter that much? Some studies have indicated that people who 
were shown videos with identical video quality but differing audio quality judged 
those videos with better sound as having better video quality. If you can come up with 
a great piece of music, sometimes it’s worth taking the “video-for-audio” route.
P Note: Conveniently, 
the video ends just after 
measure 17. Most pop 
music is constructed 
in groups of four 
measures, so the music 
used for this soundtrack 
can last for four groups 
of four measures 
and then fade out to 
the end of the video 
on something like a 
cymbal crash, sustained 
note, orchestral hit, or 
the like.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 263
Building the soundtrack
The basic strategy for this project is to lay down a rhythmic “bed” in the back-
ground that lasts the duration of the video and then overlay hits and additional 
sounds to emphasize the transitions.
1 Right-click (Control-click) the timeline and choose Snapping. Disable all options 
except Snap to Ruler (Coarse).
2 Use the Media Browser to navigate to the Lesson16 folder, and open the folder 
Audio for Video Files. Drag Drums1.wav into Track 1, and snap its start to 
measure 4.
3 Alt-click (Option-click) the Drums1.wav clip’s header to copy the file, and drag 
so that its start snaps to measure 6. Then make three more copies. Snap one 
clip’s start to measure 8, one to measure 12, and the third to measure 14.
4 Drag Drums2.wav from the Audio for Video Files folder into Track 1, and snap 
its start to measure 10.
5 The last half of the Drums2.wav clip would make a good ending. Alt-click 
(Option-click) the header of the Drums2.wav clip that starts at measure 10, and 
drag it so that its start snaps to measure 15. To end up with only the second 
half, hover the cursor over the last Drums2.wav clip’s left edge, and use the Trim 
tool to drag the clip’s edge right so it snaps to the beginning of measure 16.
6 Play the file from the beginning to verify that the Drum track plays back 
correctly and that there aren’t any gaps from not properly snapping to a 
measure beginning.
7 Drag the Pad.wav file into the session so it starts at the beginning of Track 2.
P Note: In this lesson 
it’s very important that 
clips snap to precise 
measure beginnings. 
Zoom in to verify that 
the snapping is correct.

264 
Lesson 16 
scoring Audio to Video
8 Drag the Bass.wav file into Track 3 and snap its start to measure 4. Copy it 
twice, and snap the beginning of one clip to measure 8 and the beginning of the 
other clip to measure 12.
9 Drag Rhythm1.wav from the Audio for Video Files folder into Track 4 and snap 
its beginning to measure 10; then drag Rhythm2.wav into Track 4 and snap its 
beginning to measure 13 so it crossfades with Rhythm1.wav over measure 13.
10 Click Rhythm2.wav’s fade-out handle, and drag it to the left so the fade begins at 
measure 16. Also, drag down for a Cosine value of around 50.
11 The rhythm track is now complete. Play it from start to finish while looking at 
the video. You’ll see that many of the musical transitions correlate to changes in 
the video, although some don’t quite match up. You’ll use the additional tracks 
to tighten up these transitions.
12 Keep the project open in preparation for the next lesson. Also note that you can 
open the Session file AudioForVideo to bring Audition to this point.
Adding hits to the marker location points
Now you’ll use short, usually percussive, sounds called hits to add audio accents to 
the video’s highlights and transitions.
1 Drag RevCymbal2.wav into Track 5 so that the clip ends at the start of 
measure 4. This leads right into the “the world’s largest music show” and makes 
a good transition from the opening pad to where the rhythmic bed starts. 
Play this transition.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 265
2 You’ll do the easiest transitions first, and then revisit the more difficult ones. 
Drag Hit.wav into Track 5, and position the clip’s start at measure 10. Click the 
fade-in handle, and drag it right so it fades into Marker 04. The hit will then 
start in time with the music but only reach full volume at the video’s transition 
point, so it will seem like the audio syncs up perfectly with the video. Play this 
transition to verify that the hit seems to happen at the same time as the white 
flash in the video.
3 With the transition around measure 12, note that the white flash frames happen 
prior to the start of the measure. Drag CymbalElectro.wav into Track 5 so the 
clip starts at 11:4, and then click the fade-in handle and drag right to just a little 
before the start of measure 12. The cymbal fades into the flash and then fades out 
into the start of the measure. This is a “looser” transition (as opposed to a “tight” 
transition) that nonetheless bridges the visual flash and music. Play this transition.
4 The transition at measure 8 is a challenge. Drag Cymbal.wav into Track 6, and 
position its start at 8:1. Play this transition. It doesn’t work; the cymbal hits too 
early compared to the flash.
5 Drag Cymbal.wav’s start to Marker 03 to see if that works. Play this transition; it 
doesn’t work either. However, note that Marker 03 is very close to 8:2, which at 
least falls on a beat. Snap Cymbal.wav’s start to 8:2.

266 
Lesson 16 
scoring Audio to Video
6 Drag CymbalHi.wav into Track 5, and snap its start to the start of measure 8. 
Having the two cymbals hit a beat apart works musically, and the second 
cymbal hit matches up perfectly with the white flash. A slight fade-in with 
the second cymbal improves the transition slightly, as does lowering its clip 
Volume envelope by around -3dB.
7 The transition around measure 6 (Marker 02) is also somewhat of a challenge, so 
you’ll use a different strategy by adapting a clip to provide a slight flourish when 
the white flash hits in the video. Although it won’t follow the beat of the music, 
by seeming more like an effect, it will still work well. You need to trim Rhythm2.
wav to exactly one measure, drag it into the end of Track 5, and snap its end to 
a measure start. Next, hover the cursor over the clip’s left side, and then drag it 
right so that the clip lasts exactly one measure.
8 Now drag this clip into its final position. Align the clip start with Marker 02, 
and then click the fade-out handle and drag it all the way to the left with a

9 Place the playhead before Marker 06, and play through the transition at Marker 
06. Note that this doesn’t really need additional audio because it’s a two-step 
transition—first there’s the flash and then the video shows “...and more!” The 
background rhythm pattern changes more or less at the same time as this 
change in the video. 
10 To wrap it up with a big finish, drag Hit.wav into Track 5 so the clip starts at 
measure 17. Now play the entire video through from start to finish to hear the 
soundtrack and hits, and how they relate to the video.
Automatic Speech Alignment
Automatic speech alignment is very important when processing dialogue in movies. 
Dialogue that’s recorded on location is often subject to noise, an inability to get actors 
close enough to the microphone without the mic appearing in the picture, and other 
issues. As a result, the actors will come in after the shoot and dub new parts. This 
process is also called looping or ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement).
Dubbing is not easy to do. The actor typically listens to the original part on head-
phones in a recording studio (as opposed to being on location) and tries to match 
the original speech as closely as possible. Sometimes actors do ADR even if it’s not 
absolutely necessary, because they want to add a different emotional inflection than 
what they originally used while shooting the scene.
Audition’s Automatic Speech Alignment feature automates this process. You load 
the original reference dialogue (which can even be relatively noisy) into an Audition 
track, and then record the new dialogue into a second track. Audition can then 
compare the new dialogue to the original and use a combination of stretching and 
alignment processes to match the new dialogue to the reference track.
1 With Audition open, navigate to the Lesson16 folder, and open the Multitrack 
Session Vocal Alignment that’s located in the Vocal Alignment folder.
2 The Session has two tracks, OriginalVocal and ADRVocal. You can use the 
ADRVocal to experiment with the Automatic Speech Alignment feature, but 
it’s instructive to record your own dialogue and try to match the OriginalVocal 
track. Mute the ADRVocal track and while listening to the OriginalVocal 
track on headphones, record a new vocal track where you try to match the 
OriginalVocal phrasing as closely as possible. If you decide to create your own 
ADR track, the B-movie-type dialogue is “Helen said she thought she’d found 
Tesla’s lab notes on wireless power transmission, and if she did, that would 
explain her disappearance. She would instantly be targeted as one of the most 
wanted people on this planet.”
P Note: The ADRVocal 
supplied with this 
project is deliberately 
way out of sync with 
the original dialogue 
so you can hear how 
Automatic Speech 
Alignment affects the 
sound quality of the 
dialogue when it has to 
do lots of correction.

Lesson 16

3 You now have two tracks to align, using either the one supplied with the lesson 
or one you created. If you recorded a vocal, trim the new clip to the same length 
as the OriginalVocal track. Select the Move tool, and draw a marquee to select 
both tracks. 
4 Right-click (Control-click) the clip that will serve as the reference to which the 
other clip should be aligned, and choose Automatic Speech Alignment. 
5 A dialog box appears. For the Reference Clip, if needed, choose the clip to 
which you want the new dialogue aligned (in this project, OriginalVocal). 
There are three Alignment options; you’ll try all three, so start with Tightest 
Alignment. Select the “Reference clip is noisy” check box because in this case, 
it is; also select the “Add aligned clip to new track” check box to allow for easy 
comparison. Click OK.

Adobe Audition Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 269
6 The aligned track appears below the reference track. Solo the OriginalVocal and 
ADRVocal tracks (or OriginalVocal and the ADR track you recorded), and then 
play them back together so you can hear the differences between the two.
7 Now solo the OriginalVocal track and the new, aligned track. You’ll hear far 
fewer differences. 
8 Click on the OriginalVocal clip, and then Ctrl-click (Command-click) on the 
ADRVocal track. Repeat steps 4 and 5, but this time select “Balanced alignment 
and stretching” in the Alignment drop-down menu. Click OK.
9 Repeat step 8, but this time select “Smoothest stretching” in the Alignment 
drop-down menu. Click OK.
10 You now have three clips with the suffix “Aligned.” Solo each one to hear how 
the three different processes affect the sound quality.
Audition integration with 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
Premiere Pro includes an Edit In Adobe Audition command. This makes it easy to 
send anything from individual clips to a selected work area (including reference 
video) to Audition for restoration, mastering, or processing (“sweetening”). With 
individual clips, any edits made in Audition will automatically update the clips in 
Adobe Premiere Pro. The same is true if you’re editing clips from After Effects.
You can also link Audition Multitrack Sessions to exported mixdown files, so when 
you select the exported file in Premiere Pro, you can do editing and remixing in 
Audition. This makes it easy to modify a soundtrack when editing in Premiere Pro 
causes a video to change over time. However, if you don’t need this level of flexibil-
ity, the two applications can simply share a mixed file from Audition’s Multitrack 
Editor. Note that when you select a mixed file, you can choose to open either the 
Audition Multitrack Session that created it or open it in the Waveform Editor for 
simple sweetening. 
The level of integration between Audition and Premiere Pro can smooth your 
workflow dramatically when you’re combining audio and video projects. Although 
covering all aspects of this integration is beyond the scope of this book, there are 
many tutorials, blog posts, and additional information on the Adobe website.
P Note: The “Smoothest  
stretching” option 
usually provides the 
best audio quality, yet 
the alignment will still 
be very tight. Of course, 
the closer the ADR 
vocal is to the original, 
the less processing 
the Automatic Speech 
Alignment needs to do 
and therefore the higher 
the sound quality.

review questions
1
Does Audition do video editing?
2
What is a “hit point”?
3
What is ADR or looping?
4
Why is it necessary to do automatic speech alignment in the Multitrack Editor instead 
of the Waveform Editor?
5 Are you limited to a single speech alignment process?
review answers
1 No. An imported video file is used as a preview, and Audition can add audio to 
the video.
2 A hit point is a transition or event in the video that you want to accent with some 
musical element.
3 ADR and looping are techniques that allow actors to replace low-quality dialogue 
in a movie with higher-quality dialogue, typically recorded in a studio instead of 
on location.
4 You must do automatic speech alignment in the Multitrack Editor because you need 
to have two tracks in the Session—the original dialogue and the replacement dialogue 
you want to align to the original dialogue.
5 No; there are three different ways to do alignment that trade off tighter alignment for 
smoother vocal quality.

Appendix: 
pAnel RefeRence 
This appendix summarizes the functions of all panels included with Adobe 
Audition. Note that several panels can show a large amount of data, which practi-
cally speaking can be seen only if you undock or float the panel, and extend its 
length, height, or both.
Amplitude Statistics
This panel applies to the Waveform Editor only, and provides detailed informa-
tion about the waveform’s amplitude, bit depth, dynamic range, the possibility that 
samples have been clipped, and more. Clicking Scan analyzes the entire waveform, 
unless only part of the waveform is selected; in that case, the button will say Scan 
Selection, and only that section will be analyzed. You can also click Copy to copy 
these statistics to the computer’s clipboard, and paste the clipboard contents into 
a text document.
The RMS histogram tab shows how much energy (RMS amplitude; vertical axis) 
is present at various amplitude levels (horizontal axis). This can display the right 
or left channel, but not both.

272 
Appendix panel reference
Batch process
To convert and export files to a specific format, drag the files from the desktop, 
Media Browser, or Files panel into the Batch Process panel. The panel’s Export 
Settings button opens a window that lets you choose the format to which the files 
will be converted, as well as add a distinctive prefix or suffix; click the Run button 
to initiate the conversion/export process.

Adobe Audition CS6 ClASSroom in A book 273
diagnostics 
This panel is the same as the one that opens when you select part or all of a 
waveform in the Waveform Editor, then choose Effects > Diagnostics. It provides 
processing that can minimize clicks and clipping, as well as delete silence and show 
marked sections of a waveform.
editor 
This panel shows the currently selected Editor (Waveform or Multitrack).

274 
Appendix panel reference
effects Rack 
This panel shows the effects currently inserted into a selected track or clip in the 
Multitrack Editor, or waveform in the Waveform Editor. It can optionally display 
input/output and mix controls, as well as input/output metering.
files
This panel shows all files currently loaded into Audition (Waveform and Multitrack 
Editor), as well as several file attributes (duration, sample rate, channels, bit 
depth, file path, and so on). The file currently being displayed in either Editor is 
highlighted with tan text. A preview section along the bottom of the panel allows 
previewing files.

Adobe Audition CS6 ClASSroom in A book 275
frequency Analysis
For a selected file (or portion of a file) in the Waveform Editor, this panel shows 
amplitude response (vertical axis) plotted against frequency (horizontal axis). The 
frequency range can be displayed linearly or logarithmically; you can store up to 
eight “snapshots” taken at particular points in the waveform, and for comparison, 
display each one using a separate color.
History
This panel shows a history of operations that have been applied to the Waveform 
Editor or Multitrack Editor, depending on which is open. Clicking an entry returns 
you to the file status as of that operation, and is nondestructive. If you click an 
entry and then click the Trash icon, all history will be removed after (and includ-
ing) that entry; this is destructive and cannot be undone.

276 
Appendix panel reference
levels
This panel displays a waveform’s level in the Waveform Editor, or the Master Track 
output level in the Multitrack Editor. You can resize these meters to extend up to the 
entire width or length of your monitor screen to provide extremely high resolution. 
Markers
When markers are inserted in either the Waveform or Multitrack Editor, this panel 
shows information about them—name, start point, duration, type, and so on. 
You can also rename, delete, and change marker types in this panel. Note that it 
switches automatically to display the markers for the selected Editor.
Match Volume
Intended primarily for mastering, this panel analyzes files dragged into the panel 
(from the desktop, Media Browser, or Files panel) for peak and average loudness 
levels. You can then choose to match these files to a reference. This panel also 
includes a batch processing function to export the matched files.

Adobe Audition CS6 ClASSroom in A book 277
Media Browser
This panel provides an Explorer- or Finder-like way to browse and display the 
drives, folders, and files on your computer. You can then drag files into either the 
Waveform or Multitrack Editor, as well as preview the file or auto-play files upon 
selecting them in the Media Browser. In addition to dragging files, you can drag 
folders into either Editor to load multiple files simultaneously.
Metadata
You can enter a variety of information that’s saved with every file, whether audio 
from the Waveform Editor or a Session file from the Multitrack Editor. Types of 
Metadata include Broadcast Wave File data, ID3, Cart, etc.

278 
Appendix panel reference
Mixer
This panel provides an alternate way to look at, and work with, the Multitrack 
Editor. The layout more closely resembles that of a traditional hardware mixer.
phase Meter
This panel displays the phase relationship between channels (stereo or surround) 
in the Waveform Editor, or the Master Track output in the Multitrack Editor. 
Readings toward the right indicate that the channels are more in-phase, while read-
ings toward the left indicate the channels are out of phase to some degree. If the 
meter is all the way to the left, the two channels being compared are out of phase. 

Adobe Audition CS6 ClASSroom in A book 279
playlist
This panel works in conjunction with the Waveform Editor. You can place multiple 
selection markers within the waveform, then drag these markers from the Markers 
panel into the Playlist panel in any arbitrary order. This is an excellent way to test 
out different arrangements for a song; you can also choose to repeat (loop) the 
region defined by the selection marker an arbitrary number of times.
properties
This panel shows the properties for (depending on what’s selected) a file in the 
Waveform Editor, a Multitrack Session if no clips are selected (as shown), or the 
properties for a selected clip within a Multitrack Session.

280 
Appendix panel reference
Selection/View
The Selection line of this panel shows the start, end, and duration of the cur-
rent selection. View shows the start, end, and duration of what you can see in the 
Waveform or Multitrack Editor, depending on which one is selected.
Track panner
This panel applies only to surround multitrack projects. It provides surround pan-
ning for whichever track is selected.

Adobe Audition CS6 ClASSroom in A book 281
Time
This panel displays the time at the Current Time Indicator (playhead), expressed in 
the same time units as the timeline calibration. You can also right-click this panel 
to change the time units, and resize it to a giant size so narrators and instrumental-
ists can see the time when at a distance from the computer screen.
Tools
You can undock the toolbar that is normally located at the top of the Workspace. 
This not only includes the toolbar tools, but also, when undocked, it lets you 
choose a Workspace and provides a search box for Audition Help.
Transport 
This panel duplicates the transport functions normally located toward the bottom 
left of the Waveform and Multitrack Editors.

282 
Appendix panel reference
Video 
If a video file is loaded into the Multitrack Editor, you can see the video preview in 
the Video panel. Right-clicking (Control-clicking) the video panel allows choosing 
different levels of scaling, as well as resolution.
Zoom 
This panel duplicates the transport functions normally located toward the bottom 
right of the Waveform and Multitrack Editors.

Contributor
Musician/author Craig Anderton, an internationally-recognized authority on musical 
electronics, has written more than twenty books and well over a thousand articles. He’s 
also an award-winning recording artist who has played on, produced, or mixed fifteen 
major-label albums, mastered hundreds of tracks, and played Carnegie Hall; he’s taken his 
solo act to Europe and the U. S., as well as guested with groups like Air Liquide and played 
in a “power duo” with former Public Enemy bandleader Brian Hardgroove. An accom-
plished analog circuit engineer, Anderton’s designs have been used by bands such as Boston, the Motels, 
Sammy Hagar, and Van Halen, as well as solo artists from Larry Graham to Steve Cropper. 
Because of his ability to demystify complex technology and present a practical, hands-on approach to get-
ting a great sound, Craig is a popular lecturer who has given seminars in 38 states, 10 countries, and three 
languages. He also saw the potential of the net early on—his Sound, Studio, and Stage forum (started in 
1995 on AOL) is the world’s longest-running Internet forum for musicians. Anderton is currently Editor 
in Chief of www.harmonycentral.com, Executive Editor of Electronic Musician magazine (which he co-
founded in the mid-‘80s), Editor at Large for Keyboard magazine, and a monthly columnist for Sound on 
Sound, Guitar Player, and Pro Sound News magazines.
