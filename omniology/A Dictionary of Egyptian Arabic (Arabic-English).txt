The compilers are indebted to a great many people for their advice and assistance. In the first place, the project 
would not have come into being at all without the support and encouragement of the late Chri~topher Thoron, who 
was President of the American University in Cairo from 1969 until his untimely death in 1974. Among other officers 
or former officers of the American University in Cairo who did much to facilitate work, particularly in times of 
difficulty, were Dr Richard Crabbs, Dr Hussein Fawzy, Dr Mohammed Allam, Dr Cecil Byrd, Dr Thomas Lamont, 
Mr Peter Nichols, Dr Richard Pedersen, Dr Moyer Hunsberger, Dr Marsden Jones, Mr Ahmed El-Lozy, Mr Carl 
Schieren and Miss Priscilla Blakemore. 
The project enjoyed the support of several institutions. A major part of the funding was provided by the U.S. 
Office of Education, among whose officers Mrs Julia Petrov, who was our understanding and longsuffering Program 
Officer, and Dr Richard Thompson deserve special thanks for their help. Substantial support was also provided by 
the Ford Foundation, in which connection acknowledgement is due to Mr William Irelan, Dr Ronald Wolfe, Mr 
Courtney Nelson, Mr Samuel Bunker, Dr Bjorn Jernu~d and Professor Richard Tucker. The moral support ofthe 
Arabic Language Academy in Cairo was indispensable, and for this we owe thanks in particular to Dr Ibrahim 
Madkour, formerly Secretary and now Chairman of the Academy, for his encouragement and advice (although the 
content of the' dictionary is of course the responsibility of the compilers alone), and to Mr Ibrahim El-Tarzi. 
The basic work of preparation of this dictionary took place between the years 1972-1977. Two experts whose help 
was indispensable during this period were Dr Raymond Bathurst, who handled the technical and computing side of 
the operation, and Dr Karl Stowasser, who iliitiated us into the elusive art of lexicography and readily shared with us 
the labour of drafting and redrafting some of the most complex entries. We were also fortunate enough to have the 
benefit of informed comments and criticisms from Professor T.F. Mitchell and Mr David Cowan. Work on the 
"production line" included labours of herculean proportions, particularly on the part of our principal assistants Dr 
Humphrey Davies and Mrs Carol Bebawi, while special mention needs to be made too of the contribution of Dr 
Elizabeth Sartain (notably her work in the area of etymologies), Dr Kristina Nelson, Mr Mohammed El-Saati, Mr 
Maged El-Kommo~ and Mr Jeffrey Bennett; the illustrations are the work of Mrs Elizabeth Rodenbeck. To these 
and to the very many others -
too numerous to name -
who gave of themselves unstintingly in this work, we extend 
our thanks.

Introduction 
This dictionary is intended to satisfy a longstanding need on the part of speakers of English for a dictionary with 
which to comprehend Egyptian Arabic. During the past twenty-five years progress has been made in the 
lexicography of Arabic dialects other than Egyptian, principally as a result of efforts based at Georgetown 
University; and the study of literary Arabic was transformed for speakers of English by the appearance in 1%1 of 
Hans Wehr's A dictionary of modern written Arabic. Such developments have highlighted the need for 
documentation of the dominant regional form of Arabic. For Egyptian Arabic is not only the native tongue of over 
forty-five million people who constitute just under one third of the Arabic-speaking world; it is also -
because of 
Egypt's important cultural and political role as an Arab state -
the most widely understood form of regional Arabic. 
The language described here is essentially spoken language and, as such, it may be contrasted with formal written 
language. In this connection, it may first be remarked that the prevalence of the view that literary Arabic (al-Iugha 
al-f~l)d) should replace its "corrupt" variant, the popular language (al-Iugha al-'iimmiyya), as the normal vehicle of 
spontaneous spoken communication cannot be allowed to obscure the fact that this is not the case in Egypt at present 
and there are no grounds for anticipating any major change in this respect. Moreover, the associated notion that only 
al-f~l)ii can be credited with a "real" existence as a "proper" system oflanguage (to the exclusion ofthe 'iimmiyya of 
the uneducated) fails to explain how educated and uneducated Egyptians alike -
all of whom communicate with 
each otherin the course oftheir daily round by means of 'iimmiyya of one sort or another -contrive to achieve some 
measure of mutual intelligibility. This dictionary is accordingly based on an alternative view of language variation in 
Egypt, a view which sees the 'iimmiyya of illiterate people as no less a system oflanguage than is the inherited classical 
f~1)d and -
in the absence of any clear picture of historical evolution -
envisages a synchronic language scheme in 
which these two systems are at extremes from one another, while between them lie three other distinguishable 
systems. Each of these five systems, or levels, contains elements which exist also in one or more of the other levels, 
but in varying proportions; although the divisions between the levels are of course blurred rather than clear-cut, each 
level can nonetheless be typified by its own specific combination of linguistic and allied social, educational and 
psychological characteristics. 
This schemel distinguishes two levels off~l)ii and three levels of 'iimmiyya. The older of the two levels of{u$l)d, 
which may be termed f~l)ii al-turiith, is specifically the linguistic vehicle of the legacy of Islamic high culture and 
religion, while contem~orary {u$1)d, which may be termed {u$1)d al-'a.m is the vehicle of modern culture and 
technology. In Egypt, f~l)ii al-turiith varies only minimally from the classical descriptions of f~l)ii. as might be 
expected in what is now in effect a liturgical language. F~1)d al-'tl.$r. on the other hand, as the vehicle of today's 
intellectual needs, exhibits features which contrast with the usual classical conventions -
notably a marked 
preference for nominal, rather than verbal, sentences; moreover, when employed orally in Egypt, f~l)ii al-'tl.$r 
displays other departures (phonological, morphological and syntactic) from the norms off~1)d al-turiith, and these 
departures for the most part occur in more pronounced forms in the various levels of 'iimmiyya. This dictionary is not 
concerned with lexical items which are restricted to one or both of these levels of f~l)d, on the ground that they are 
I Thl: scheme is set out in detail in al-Sa'id Mul;lammad Badawi, Mustawayat al-'arabiy.ya al-mu'lqira fi mi$r 
(Cairo, 1973).

common to Egypt and other parts of the Arabic-writing world and are (or should be) documented elsewhere. 
Three levels of 'limmiyya can usefully be distinguished and it is with these that this dictionary is concerned. The 
mother tongue of any given Egyptian child is one of only two of these. the principal distinction here being whether 
the family background of the child is characterized by literacy or illiteracy. By the time a child reaches school age. he 
will have acquired a type of mother tongue which can be broadly classified as the 'limmiyya either of the 
"enlightened" (al-mutanawwirfn) or of the illiterate (al-ummiyyfn). the latter being predominant. If the child then 
goes to school. he is made to function not on his own linguistic level but on the level of fU$1)ti al-'O$r (in secular 
schools) or of /l1$1)1i al-Iurlilh (within the Azhar system). It is here. in respect of the individual- rather than in the 
broader frame of the totality of Egyptian language variation -
that the phenomenon termed diglossia can usefully be 
reco~nized and studied, for from this time the child advances (or fails to advance. as the case may be) simultaneously 
on two separate language levels., advance in one being linked with advance in the other. What may be regarded as a 
fruitful culmination of this process -
in the form of mastery of the third. acquired. level of 'limmiyya, namely that of 
the highly educated (al-muthaqqafin) -
is restricted to a small percentage of the population. This level of 'limmiyya 
is in effect the spoken counterpart of the writtenfU$1)1i al-'a$r and is used only in appropriate con~exts of interaction 
between muthaqqafin or would-be muthaqqafin; their language in more mundane contexts is ordinarily 'limmiyyat 
al-mutanawwirin, although some may also initially have been speakers of 'limmiyyat al-ummiyyin. 
A few examples of linguistic distinctions between these three broad levels of 'limmiyya may be useful here. 
'Ammiyyat al-muthaqqafin, being the 'limmiyya most strongly influenced by al-fU$I)Ii, is characterized 
phonologically by a measure of flexibility in respect of both consonants and vowels: although the .!.o , the ~ and 
the ~ are usually rendered ass, Z and ~ respectively, they are sometimes given the phonetic values offU$l)li, and the 
J frequently occurs as q; the fU$1)1i diphthongs aw and ay also occur, albeit less commonly than 00 and ee; andfU$1)ti 
long vowels are sometimes preserved in unstressed positions. In the phonology of 'limmiyyal al-mulanawwirin, 
however. the element associable withfU$1)1i is smaller: the.!.o. the ~ and the ~ are commonly rendered as t, d and 4, 
and less commonly as s, Z and ~, while the J only infrequently occurs as q; the diphthongs aw and ay normally 
disappear, as do fU$hli long vowels which fall outside the Egyptian system of word stress. In the phonology of 
'limmiyyal al-ummiyyin, the ':".the ~ and the ~ are rendered as I, d and 4 with very few exceptions, and the J as q is 
rare (e.g. muqri, qur'lin). 
As far as morphology and syntax are concerned. passive forms are fairly common in 'limmiyyat al-muthaqqafin, 
are much less common in 'limmiyyal al-mulanawwirin, and are afmost entirely absent in 'limmiyyat al-ummiyyin; the 
residual occurrences of the i'rlib of fU$1)1i and of fU$1)1i negation systems to be found in 'limmiyyat al-muthaqqafin are 
not to be found in the two other levels of 'limmiyya; the use of verbal nouns and the occurrence of verbal sentences 
are far more common in 'limmiyyat al-muthaqqafin than in the two other levels; with these two other levels comes 
greater use of constructions involving billi' and fi(h), as well as an additional system of enumeration in contexts of 
ordering and itemizing; finally. 'limmiyyat al-ummiyyin is characterized in particular by its partiality for formulaic 
expressions and cliches. 
The total scheme of language variation and interaction in Egypt can be represented in diagrammatical form thus:

In thi~ diagram. the line a-b reprcsents what i~ theoretically the highest level of "correctness" in the literary 

x 
language, i.e. what is widely esteemed as the pure jiqIJa described by classical grammarians and lexicographers. The 
line cod, on the other hand, represents what is theoretically the least educated type of 'ammiyya, i.e. the form of 
language which exhibits the greatest number oflinguistic differences fromfl4lJa and enjoys little or no esteem within 
the community. Lines a-f and b-f represent the erosion of features attributed to the line a-b; in other words, they 
represent the proportional distribution of fl4IJa features within the various levels. Conversely, lines c-e and doe 
represent the erosion of features attributed to the line cod; in other words, they represent the proportional 
distribution of 'ammiyya features within the various levels. The area e-g-f-h accordingly represents the overlap of the 
literary and colloquial languages, while the areas a-g-e and e-h-b represent "pure" jiq/.lii features and the areas c-g-f 
and f-h-d represent "pure" 'iimmiyya features. The areas a-g-c and b-h-d represent the proportional distribution of 
foreign (dakhil) influence within the five levels. 
In connection with foreign borrowings it should first be stressed that what may be foreign to the Arabic component 
of Egyptian Arabic is not necessarily foreign to Egypt. Arabic was, after all, a language at one time foreign to 
Egyptians, and the labellin~of ancient but surviving Coptic and Greek elements as "foreign" is intended to signify 
their foreignness to Arabic rather than to Egypt. The identification of existing lexical items with ancient Coptic forms 
is, moreover, fraught with difficulty (more is said about this below) and there is often no way of knowing whether an 
identifiably Greek form first gained some currency in Egypt before the Arab conquest (effectively completed in 
641 AD) or after it. All that can usefully be said here in this regard is that there seems to have been a fusion from the 
seventh century onwards of one or more kinds of Arabic with certain pre-existing elements in Egypt, together with 
the super-addition of further foreign borrowings. The Arabic character of the language is pervasive, to the extent 
perhaps of having recast in an Arabic mould some of what was absorbed from the indigenous linguistic environment, 
for example in the vocabulary of riparian agrarian life, which was alien to the Arab cultural heritage. Such recasting is 
evident in the clustering of semantically related forms around verb roots which seem unlikely to have their origin in 
Arabic; on the other hand, there are also instances where such verb-root evolution has not taken place, and in this 
respect Egyptian Arabic can be contrasted with Syrian Arabic, which is more productive of verb roots in such 
circumstances. In general terms, then, Egyptian Arabic can be regarded as consisting of two main lexical categories, 
each of which can be subdivided: 1. Arabic: a) items which coinc1de nearly or completely with counterparts existing 
in literary Arabic, and b) items which have recognizable counterparts in literary Arabic, while yet differing from 
them in some significant and specifically Egyptian fashion. 2. Non-Arabic: a) items apparently specific to Egypt and 
without Arabic counterparts, and not identifiable as relatively modern foreign borrowings, and b) items identifiable 
as relatively modern borrowings. 
The levels which contain the smallest proportions of non-Arabic items are fl4IJa al-turath and 'ammiyyat 
al-ummiyyin, the former because of its static and frozen character and the latter because illiteracy has the effect of 
insulating its speakers from the direct influence of modern culture and the outside world. In 'ammiyyat al-ummiyyin, 
the majority of non-Arabic items are old or fairly old residents in the language (Coptic, Persian and Turkish, 
together with some Greek, Italian, French and English), mostly in such areas as agriculture, food, the household and 
administration; normally, o~ly major and dramatic events, such as war, can account for the admission of new 
borrowings at that level (e.g., nabalm). A greater number of non-Arabic items is to be found both injiqIJa al-'fL1r and 
in 'ammiyyat al-mutanawwirin, although of differing types. The items infl4IJa al-'fL1r. for the most part belong to the 
vocabulary of modern culture and technology and have either achieved recognition from the Arabic Language 
Academy or have simply acquired currency by the legitimizing force of written usage. Non-Arabic items in 
'ammiyyat al-mutanawwirin, on the other hand, relate for the most part to areas such as fashion, imported cosmetics, 
modern household appliances etc., which are beyond the financial reach and -
often -
the inherited tastes of 
speakers of 'ammiyyat al-ummiyyin; thus, while many of the non-Arabic items occurring in 'ammiyyat al-ummiyyin 
occur also in 'ammiyyat al-mutanawwirin, the converse does not hold true. Finally, it can be noted that it is 'ammiyyat 
al-muthaqqafin that contains the greatest number of non-Arabic items: this is because it makes use of items to be 
found in all the other levels, because its speakers are most directly in contact with influences from outside, and 
because they are not as restrained in speech as they are in writing. Indeed, nearly all newly borrowed items make 
their entrance into Egypt by way of this level and from this point may move also intofl4lJa al-'fL1r (e.g., siryaa/i) or 
into 'ammiyyat al-mutanawwirin (e.g., fil-faylaynar), although some items do not move further and may die out 
naturally (e.g., fin-noohaaw). 

XI 
It is the purpose of this dictionary to ~ocument stable lexical items occurring in anyone or more of the three levels 
of 'iimmiyya defined above. Lexical iteins or forms restricted to 'iimmiyyat al-ummiyyin are marked with an arrow 
pointing downwards and items or forms restricted to 'iimmiyyat al-muthaqqafin (other than items which are 
self-evidently restricted to that level) are marked with an arrow pointing upwards. Although the designation 
"Egyptian Arabic" has been employed, the focus is on Cairo and the phonological frame is that of Cairo and the 
Delta, to the exclusion of Upper Egypt where the phonology is markedly different; Alexandria, too, has been denied 
the closer attention that it clearly deserves. Rural items given here belong to the rural scene in the vicinity of Cairo 
and in the Delta, although the seemingly endless range of local variants there has by no means been covered 
exhaustively. Other items may be assumed to be current in Cairo unless otherwise indicated. 
The entries have been drafted with the primary purpose of fulfilling the needs of an English-speaking user who 
requires a general, overall-desc~iptive, synchronic, comprehension dictionary of Egyptian Arabic at all levels of 
society. As an overall-descriptive synchronic dictionary, it is intended to describe the language as it is now, rather 
than as it was, as it may be in the future, or as some would like it to be. Particular importance has been attached to the 
provision of numerous examples, both transparent in meaning and non-transparent. One departure from normal 
practice in bilingual synchronic lexicography of modern languages is, however, a modest attempt to provide some 
information of an etymological character; more is said about this below, but it may be stressed here that the 
compilers are well aware of the limitations of the present 2000-item etymological contribution. As for highly 
specialized terminology, and compound terms in particular, the question of what to include and what to leave out 
across the various subject areas has been noJess problematical here than in the compilation of any overall-descriptive 
dictionary. Special attention has been paid to termini technici in traditional areas of activity, which are fairly stable in 
the language but for the most part less well documented than the termini technici of modern science and technology; 
but it is clear that much subject-related work is needed to a greater depth than has been possible here if a lalge part of 
the highly specialized vocabulary of traditional Egyptian handicrafts is not to pass into oblivion. The main 
geographical names have been included, both inside and outside Egypt; personal names have been included only in 
special cases, notably where idiomatic expressions are involved. For a succinct description of the grammar of 
Egyptian Arabic, the user is referred to T.F. Mitchell, An introduction to Egyptian colloquial Arabic (London, 
Oxford University Press, 1956, repro 1978); mention may here be made also ofT.F. Mitchell, Colloguial Arabic: the 
living language of Egypt (London, English Universities Press, 1962) and Ernest T. Abdel-Massih, An introduction to 
Egyptian Arabic (Ann Arbor, The University of Michigan, 1975). 
Although there can be no doubt that this work suffers from shortcomings of a kind inevitable in a pioneering work, 
in this case exacerbated by a dearth of relevant linguistic studies, the status of pioneer in the field must in truth be 
accorded to Socrates Spiro, whose Egyptian Arabic-English dictionary first appeared in 1895 under the title An 
Arabic-English vocabulary of the colloquial Arabic of Egypt containing the vernacular items and expressions, slang 
phrases, vocables etc. used by native Egyptians, and in revised form in 1923 under the title An Arabic-English 
dictionary of the modern Arabic of Egypt. Spiro's work gives about 12,500 fairly detailed entries, attempts to identify 
bon:owings from other languages, and provides some contextual illustrations, but despite its merits it is now ofvalue 
only for its intrinsic historical interest and is, understandably enough, inadequate and misleading as a guide to 
Egyptian Arabic of the present day. Many terms given by Spiro (particularly those of Turkish origin) have since 
become obsolete, others have changed in sense or form, and numerous new lexical items and expressions have 
gained acceptance since his time, whether by borrowing from other languages or by internal derivation for purposes 
of new or substantially overhauled institutional, technological and ideological terminology. Accordingly, no reliance 
was placed on Spiro during the compilation of this dictionary, although a check at the final stage did yield some items 
which would otherwise have been missed. 
A fundamental feature ofthe present work is that it has been undertaken as a dictionary ofa "vacuum" type, based 
on field work and raw data without reference to any previous dictionary (apart from the final check of Spiro just 
mentioned). This is not to say that relevant published work was ignored, but attestations were not accepted merely 
on the authority of the printed word, and the overwhelming bulk of the data was oral and transcribed from 
tape-recordings. Several million words of material were edited down to a corpus of 400,000 words covering all 
aspects of Egyptian life, mostly in context strings, and were encoded with accompanying lexical analysis in 
machine-readable form so that they could be processed by computer in a way which yielded an ordered distillation of 

XII 
all encoded material and analysis. The drafting was based on this distillation and resulted in the present text of over 
22,500 headword entries. This figure may be compared with the 35,000 headword entries of Wehr (third edition) in a 
text of about the same length and with the 14,000 headword entries in a text of about half the length to be found in 
A dictionary of Iraqi Arabic: Arabic-English compiled by Woodhead and Beene (Georgetown 1967). The relatively 
greater length of the average headword entry in the present work can be attributed mainly to the quantity of 
illustrative examples included in many of the 30,000 sense divisions, among them over 6,500 idiomatic and 
non-transparent usages. 
Arrangement of Entries 
1. Roots 
The Arabic rooting system is employed, with modifications appropriate to the arrangement of Egyptian Arabic. 
Roots containing verbs are normally treated as they would be in the lexicography of literary Arabic, except that roots 
including radicals associated with the literary":" and ~ are given in their Egyptian forms, with cross-references from 
the literary form of the root; thus the headword ladc:a appears under the root t ~ J and there is a cross-reference to 
that root from the literary root t ~ J. The rooting of items containing the glottal stop associated with Arabic J 
preserves that J, however, since the uvular rendering of J coexists in the language with the glottal rendering, while 
the":" and ~ (with one exception of little importance) in effect represent phonemes which do not exist in Egyptian 
Arabic. 
In cases where two or more Egyptian variants of a literary Arabic root exist, these are sometimes brought together 
and sometimes kept separate -
always with cross-references -
according to semantic criteria. Thus J .!l ~ and J .!l j 
arc kept apart as separate roots, both cross-referenced from J .!l ~; on the other hand, there is every reason for 
keeping together all the items associated with a literary root such as":" J ..:.. and on such occasions the dominant 
Egyptian root has been used for grouping purposes, so that the root..;:.. J ..;:.. heads all relevant entries, both tilt, talat 
etc. and sulus, sulaasi etc.; there is a simple cross-reference to..;:.. J ..;:.. from the literary root..:.. J ..:.., and another 
cross-reference from the minor sibling Egyptian root V" J V" with a listing of the relevant headwords to be found 
under..;:.. J ..;:.., viz. sulus, sulaasi etc. 
Identical roots containing groups of lexical scatter semantically distinct from each other have been separated and 
numbered off. However, where two or more items with identical radicals exist ali:isolated forms, these have been 
given under a single root, such a root being within parentheses. The rooting of items which cannot readily be 
associated with verbs has been carried out by reference to the headword in its transcribed form, e.g., ~ ~ 1$ for yadd. 
Non-verbal Egyptian forms and foreign borrowings which cannot be regarded as having a place in fU$I:lli al-turiith 
take long vowels into account e.g., oj I ..; t for c:afaan and oj.J J ~ 
for $aloon; final short vowels are sometimes 
regarded as long for this purpose in any position up to the fourth radical, e.g., I ..; I y for baafa and I r oj V" for 
sinima. Where it appears from lexical scatter that some assimilation can be regarded as having taken place in a 
headword, this has been taken into account in the selection of the radicals, e.g., the root y .J Y oj â¢ for the headword 
f'ambuuba In pI l'anabiibl. Where, however, an item has an exact counterpart long resident in classical Arabic, the 
literary root form has been accorded to it even when a verb form is lacking, e.g .. the root....iJ t for the headword 
xaruuf. Basically, the user who rders to literary root forms should have no difficulty in finding the right place, albeit 
by means of cross-references. Two final points may be mentioned here: where the root exceeds five radicals, the first 
four are given followed by a dash; and the ordering of roots takes gemination into account, instead of placing 
geminate roots at the head of a series, e.g. ~ ~ ..; follows t ~ ..; instead of preceding it. 
2. Headwords 
All headwords are given in two forms, viz. a form in Arabic script and a phonetic representation given in italic 
transcription. The forms given in Arabic script are intended to serve as a guide to the common written form, subject 
to the limitation that Egyptian Arabic is still essentially a spoken language without firm orthographic conventions. 
The following points may be noted in connection with headwords: 
i) 
The ordering of headwords within a root entry is according to the principle of first giving the simple verb and 
forms directly 'associated with it, followed by non-verbal forms grouped and ordered according to length, and 

finally derived verbs and forms associated with them. 
ii) The symbols used in conjunction with transcribed headwords are: 
a) t : restricted to 'iimmiyyal al-mulhaqqaftn 
b) J : restricted to 'iimmiyyal al-ummiyyin 
c) colon: current in (following phrases) 
d) small elevated numeral: one of two or more homophones. 
iii) Variant headwords of roughly equal currency are dealt with in the following ways: 
a) Many entries that are short are repeated. e.g.: 
~.J 'i laring Icoll nl Seville oranges. -
also naring. 
~.;l; naring lcoll nl Seville oranges. -
also laring. 
XIII 
b) In the case of the coexistence of assimilated and unassimilated forms taken to be of roughly equal currency. 
these are given as follows: ':";"';1 rilsabbilor rissabbil . .. The verbal information run-on (see below) of such 
an entry gives only unassimilated forms. but this should not be taken to mean that assim:lated forms are any 
less common. 
iv) Variant headwords of unequal currency 
Where phonetic variations are such that they lie within the frame ofthe Arabic-script headword. they are given in 
an order of priority which is intended to reflect notions of their relative currency. e.g .â¢ jl~.; lurkuwaaz. 
lirkuwaaz, turukwaaz, lirikwaaz . .. Less current variants which do not lie within the frame ofthe Arabic-script 
headword are given in parentheses in the entry of the more current form and cross-referenced from their own 
root. e.g .â¢ under the root,:, I.;. t. the entry reads,:,l...!.la/aan (alsolala/aan) . .. and there is across-reTerence 
to the latter form from the root entry ,:, 1 .;. J t. Parentheses are also used when a headword may be used in 
conjunction with another word with no change of meaning. e.g .â¢ zabaadi (also laban zabaadi); in such cases no 
implication of relative currency.is intended. 
3. Verbal information and run-on entries 
Entries dealing with verbs normally terminate with a listing of the verbal noun(s) and verbal adjectives or 
participles associated with that verb in Egyptian Arabic; the forms given are sometimes incongruous from the 
standpoint of literary Arabic. These items of verbal information do not thereafter qualify for treatment as separate 
entries unless they occur in set phrases requiring definition away from the verb entry or have nominal or adjectival 
functions in addition to their verbal functions. In a spirit of compromise. the term "inactive verbal adjective" (iva) 
has been employed in order to avoid the need to describe the participles of intrinsically passive derived forms of the 
verb as either active or passive -
this being a moot point among exponents of Arabic grammar. 
Idiomatic and phrasal run-on entries start on a new line preceded by ~. Material is allocated to a run-on entry when 
it is in some way distinct from the main entry that it follows while yet being too closely linked with it in form to merit 
an independent entry. The most common examples of such material are verb-plus-preposition as a lexical unit. 
conjunctional phrases formed from preposition-plus-ma, and adverbial forms such as laadalan and lumuuman. 
4. Etymologies 
With regard to material of an etymological character in this dictionary, more could have been done if a very great 
deal more time had been available for the task. In practice. however. the priorities ofthe documentation of Egyptian 
Arabic dictated adherence to modest goals in this complex area. by concentrating in the first place on pulling 
together the fairly exiguous relevant work available and then by adding such further points as became apparent. 
Entanglement in the toils of Semitic philology has not seemed appropriate. so that loanwords which have for long 
been resident in Arabic generally have only rarely been accorded etymons in Hebrew. Syriac etc. The focus has been 
rather on items borrowed specifically by Egypt and on loanwords more general in the various regional forms of 
Arabic but of recent arrival, and the main languages involved are therefore Coptic, Greek, Turkish. Italian. French 
and English. Two general works consulted in this connection were Rufii'n Nakhla al-Yasii'i. Gharii'ib al-Iahja 
al-mi$riyya (Beirut. 1964) and AtJmad 'isii. al-Mu/:lkam ft U$1iI al-kalimiit al-'iimmiyya (Cairo, 1938).1 
IThe reader is also referred to Erich Prokosch, Osmanisches WOr/glll im Agyptisch-Arabisclll?ll (Berlin, 1983). which 
appeared too late to be taken into account in this dictionary. 

XIV 
The task of dealing with survivals from Coptic is accompanied by particular complications, not only because of the 
antiquity of that language and the shortage of published studies on its relation with Egyptian Arabic but also because 
Coptic terms varied in the different Coptic dialects and there are in any case difficulties in knowing how they were 
pronounced. For these reasons, and because too some of the likely etymons are recorded only in hieroglyphs, 
CopticJEgyptian etymons have not been given. The identification <Copb, it should be noted, includes those items 
attested only in hieroglyphs. In addition to Nakhla's book mentioned above, the following works have been 
consulted in this connection: Wilson B. Bishai, "The Coptic influence on Egyptian Arabic" (Johns Hopkins 
University Ph.D. dissertation, Baltimore, 1959); ibid. "Coptic lexical influence on Egyptian Arabic", Journal of 
Near Eastern Studies 23 (1964), pp.39-47; W.E. Crum, A Coptic dictionary (Oxford, 1939); George Sobhy, Common 
words in the spoken Arabic of Egypt, of Greek and Coptic origin (Cairo, 1950); and Wilyam N;q;ir, al-'Adat 
al-m~riyya bayna 'l-ams wa-'l-yawm (Cairo, 1967). 
As might be expected, there has in some cases been considerable difficulty in deciding whether a loanword was 
borrowed directly from its putative language of origin or came via another language. This is particularly so with items 
of Persian origin, some of which seem likely to have come via Turkish, others via Arabic and yet others directly. The 
same problem arises with a number of Greek and Italian terms, which may have arrived either directly or via Turkish. 
In general, an etymon is given in its form in the language of origin, unless some change in the pronunciation or 
meaning suggests a route via Turkish; in this latter case, the Turkish etymon is given, accompanied by a note "from 
P", "from It" etc. to indicate that the item is not Turkish by origin. In the case of items that can be traced to terms 
common to two or more European languages, attempts have been made on the basis of pronunciation and any other 
available clues to specify the probable source language. Items of general European origin have been left without 
etymological information. 
Etymological information is given between angle brackets and the following abbreviations are used: Copt(ic), 
Engl(ish), Fr(ench), Gr(eek), Heb(rew), It(alian), P(ersian), Sp(anish), Syr(iac), T(urkish). In cases of decided 
uncertainty, information is given with the qualifications "perh", "poss", or "prob". For reasons already indicated, 
Coptic, Syriac and Hebrew etymons are omitted, and this has also been done where the etymon is identical or almost 
identical with the definition. On rare occasions, the original sense of the etymon has been given when this has been 
thought to shed light on the entry. 
For Turkish, the following works have been consulted: New Redhouse Turkish-English dictionary (Istanbul, 
1968); J.W. Redhouse, A Turkish and English lexicon (new impression, Constantinople, 1921); H. Kahane et al., 
The lingua franca in the Levant: Turkish nautical terms of Italian and Greek origin (Urbana, 1958); and Julius 
Zenker, Turkisch-arabisch-persisches Handworterbuch (Leipzig; 1866). New Redhouse. spellings have been followed 
except in the case of the Constantinople h for kh, where b has been used to indicate the guttural which must have 
existed in the forms taken over by Egyptians. For Persian, reference has been made to Zenker and to F. Steingass, A 
comprehensive Persian-English dictionary (London, 1892), and Steingass' system of transliteration has been fol-
lowed with the exception of rendering as m his '11 which represents the Persian n when pronounced as m before b. For 
Greek, use has been made of Liddell and Scott and of Charis Patsis, Lexico elleno-angliko (Athens, 1967); the 
Random House dictionary system of transliteration of Greek has been followed except for eta, xi, upsilon, chi and 
omega, which have been rendered as e, ks, u, kh and 6 respectively. For Italian, the Reynolds' and Cassell's 
dictionaries have been used; for Spanish, Cassell's; and for French, Harrap's.

The following points may be noticed: 
i) Singular nouns ending in a or a in the transcription and in â¢ in the Arabic script are to be treated as feminine unless 
the definition specifically indicates otherwise (e.g., xaliifa). Other feminine nouns are labelled as such. 
ii) Where no plural is given, none is thought to exist. An asterisk in the grammatical information indicates the plural 
ending -iin (-yyiin if the singular ends with i). Efforts have been made to rank plurals in order of frequency of 
occurrence; where different forms seem to be equally common, the *I-aat or -aatl-yya forms have been given first. 
iii) Verbs which retain the same sense whether or not there is a following preposition have been labelled Ivt and vii. 
iv) The bold dash is used within the body of an entry to introduce grammatical information applicable to what 
follows. 
6. Special language indicators

7. Definitions and examples 
Definitions are given in British English. but the Random House dictionary has been referred to consistently in an 
attempt to avoid anglicisms unintelligible or misleading to those familiar only with American English. Most of the 
definitions are translational. with some additional "ostensive" definitions provided by the illustrations. However. 
analytical definitions have recommended themselves as less cumbersome for many instance nouns and for 
intrinsically passive derived forms of verbs themselves intransitive; in addition. analytical definition has been 
preferred in respect of most function words. on the ground that their complexities of usage can be summed up more 
readily in this way than through translational renderings which would fairly consistently fail to cover the semantic 
ranges involved. Senses and sub-senses are numbered off. Wherever possible. verbs have been defined in isolation 
from prepositions with which they may normally occur and the examples then show prepositional usages. 
Illustrative contextual examples are provided for all entries except those where the meaning is so restricted or 
specialized that such examples would merely smack of tedious pedantry. Such emphasis on examples is. of course, 
consistent with the usual lexicographical practice of citation and has the advantage of capturing some of the flavour of 
Egyptian life. -A& might be expected in formulaic areas of expression such as blessing. cursing. greeting and 
invitation. the gap between Egyptian Arabic and English is at its greatest. with resultant difficulties in finding 
renderings which convey adequately all the spontaneity and conviction of the original. The collection of idiomatic 
usages in general has been a priority and these are to be found listed among non-transparent items given after double 
bars in the entries. 
8. Transcription 
The system of phonetic transcription used here follows in most respects that adopted by T.F. Mitchell in An 
introduction to Egyptian colloquial Arabic (London. 1956. repro 1978). The main departures from that system 
concern certain vocalic renderings: a distinction is made here between a front a and a back a, and anaptyxis is shown 
wherever it occurs (rather than simply within composite morphological forms). Stress is not marked except where it 
constitutes an exception according to the rules elaborated by Mitchell; nor is stress shown in quasi-literary patterns 
such as gaamili. Thirty consonant symbols and six vowel symbols are used. the consonant symbol~ being listed here 
with their Arabic-script counterparts in the order of the Arabic alphabet. according to which the dictionary is 
arranged (subject to the modifications mentioned above in section 1).

IS 
These vowel symbols are doubled to indicate length, the Arabic-script counterparts of the pairs aa/aa, iilee and 
uu/oo being I, IS and.J respectively. 
Mastery of the exact phonetic value of each of the above symbols can of course be best achieved by practice with 
native speakers, but for descriptions of these values the user is referred to any of the grammars already mentioned. 
The following points, however, require special mention here: 
i) lj/q and r 
The J of literary Arabic is associated with two distinct sounds in Egyptian Arabic. The first of these (symbolized 
by lj) is of more widespread occurrence and is similar to the glottal stop (f). The second (symbolized by q) is similar to 
its counterpart in literary pronunciation and occurs commonly only in 'iimmiyyal al-mulhaqqafin. One good reason 
for distinguishing between f and lj is that the former may elide while the latter never elides. Compare, for example, 
rililli-sm-i (or li-fism-i) (he made a mistake in my name) with rililli-c;ism-i (he made a mistake in my share). 
ii) Doubled consonants 
Doubling of a consonant symbol in the transcription corresponds to the shadda of Arabic orthography. A doubled 
consonant is pronounced with twice the length of its single counterpart. 
iii) a-a/aa-aa 
The distinction made here is between the open vowel a made with the front of the tongue (rather like the English a 
in hal) and the open vowel a made with the back of the tongue (rather like the English vowel in t~e word calm) -cf. 
Egyptian Arabic barr (to pamper) with barr (to fulfil (a promiseÂ». The long vowels aa and aa may be regarded as 
having double the duration of a and a respectively, e.g., nabal (to sprout) and nabaal (plant), lab (all right then!) and 
(aab (to recover). 
iv) i-elii-ee 
These two vowels are produced with the front of the tongue. The closer of them, i, is similar to the vowel in the 
English pin (e.g., silim), ~hile for e the mouth is slightly more open and the vowel is roughly halfway between the 
vowels in English pin and pen; the vowel eoccurs usually as a contraction of ee in a closed syllable (e.g.,gel-na). The 
long vowels ii and ee may be regarded as having double the duration of i and e respectively, e.g., leel (bread) and 
eel-na (our bread), liifa (livelihood) and lifa (evening prayer). 
v) u-o/uu-oo 
These two vowels are produced with the back of the tongue and the relation ~etween them is analogous to the 
relation between i and e. The closer vowel, u, is similar to the vowel in English put, while for 0 the mouth is slightly 

XVIII 
more open; the vowel 0 occurs usually as a contracted form of 00 in a closed syllable (e.g., yom-na). The long vowels 
uu and 00 may be regarded as having double the duration of u and 0 respectively, e.g., door (round (in a game etc.Â» 
and dor-na (our round), duur (go around!) and durr (pearls). 
vi) Anaptyxis 
Unstressed anaptyctic vowels are represented in small elevated form, while stressed anaptyctic vowels are given in 
the normal fount. 
9. Hyphenation 
The system of hyphenation employed in the transcribed Arabic is intended to serve as an aid and does not 
constitute an attempt to lay down orthographic rules. Its purpose is to indicate the main features of the 
morphological structure oT composite forms and it is accordingly used with bound morphemes and monosyllabic 
particles, and in instances of elision, anaptyxis and linkage involving stress. Certain exceptions have been made, 
however, in order to prevent the amount of hyphenation from becoming excessive. 
i) Bound morphemes: e.g., darab-ni, wa/ad-i. Exceptions are: a) person markers used in the conjugation of the verb 
(e.g., katabt rather than katab-t, yiktib rather than yi-ktib), and b) suffixed pronominal morphemes when bound with 
prepositions or conjunctions (e.g., bikum, laleek, finnik, fikminnu). It may be noted that the third person singular 
masculine suffix after a vowel takes the form of incremental length with concomitant stress (e.g. ,fafuu they saw him, 
malaa with him). 
ii) Prefixed and suffIXed monosyllabic particles: the definite article (fit-beet), the time markers ya- and bi- (ya-yiktib) , 
the conjunctions wi- and fa- (wi-qarab-ni), the negative particles ma- and -f(ma-katab-f), and the prepositions li-, 
bi-, la- and mi- (li-beet-u). Exceptions: hyphenation is not used when a monosyllabic particle is followed by a definite 
article or by a pronominal suffix (hencefil-beet rather thanfi-I-beet, and bikum etc. as above); nor is hyphenation 
used before the conjunctive quasi-suffix (as in saacit ma, baldl mal, both because other form-classes may here be 
interpolated and because linkage here would imply erroneous stress. 
iii) Elision, anaptyxis and linkage involving stress: an example of hyphenation in elision involving stress occurs in the 
initial composite form of the phrase huwwa-na iii lamalt-u; where an anaptyctic vowel is stressed, it is preceded by a 
hyphen and followed by a hyphen, but hyphenation is not used to isolate unstressed anaptyctic vowels; the term 
linkage here relates to the enclitic use, affecting stress, of such potential free-form units as lak and di, as in fit-Ielaa-di 
(cf. fit-feela di) and katabu-ha-Ina (cf. katabuu-ha tina).
