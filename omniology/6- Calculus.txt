A great discovery solves a great problem but there is a grain of discovery in the
solution of any problem.Your problem may be modest; but if it challenges your
curiosity and brings into play your inventive faculties, and if you solve it by your
own means, you may experience the tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery.
GEORGE POLYA
PREFACE
The art of teaching, Mark Van Doren said, is the art of assisting discovery. I have tried to
write a book that assists students in discovering calculus—both for its practical power and
its surprising beauty. In this edition, as in the ﬁrst ﬁve editions, I aim to convey to the stu-
dent a sense of the utility of calculus and develop technical competence, but I also strive
to give some appreciation for the intrinsic beauty of the subject. Newton undoubtedly
experienced a sense of triumph when he made his great discoveries. I want students to
share some of that excitement.
The emphasis is on understanding concepts. I think that nearly everybody agrees that
this should be the primary goal of calculus instruction. In fact, the impetus for the current
calculus reform movement came from the Tulane Conference in 1986, which formulated
as their ﬁrst recommendation:
Focus on conceptual understanding.
I have tried to implement this goal through the Rule of Three: “Topics should be pre-
sented geometrically, numerically, and algebraically.” Visualization, numerical and graph-
ical experimentation, and other approaches have changed how we teach conceptual 
reasoning in fundamental ways. More recently, the Rule of Three has been expanded to
become the Rule of Four by emphasizing the verbal, or descriptive, point of view as well.
In writing the sixth edition my premise has been that it is possible to achieve concep-
tual understanding and still retain the best traditions of traditional calculus. The book con-
tains elements of reform, but within the context of a traditional curriculum.
ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS
I have written several other calculus textbooks that might be preferable for some instruc-
tors. Most of them also come in single variable and multivariable versions.
N
Calculus, Sixth Edition, is similar to the present textbook except that the exponential,
logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions are covered in the second semester.
N
Essential Calculus is a much briefer book (800 pages), though it contains almost all of
the topics in Calculus, Sixth Edition. The relative brevity is achieved through briefer
exposition of some topics and putting some features on the website.
N
Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals resembles Essential Calculus, but the expo-
nential, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions are covered in Chapter 3.

xii
||||
PREFACE
N
Calculus: Concepts and Contexts, Third Edition, emphasizes conceptual understanding
even more strongly than this book. The coverage of topics is not encyclopedic and the
material on transcendental functions and on parametric equations is woven throughout
the book instead of being treated in separate chapters. 
N
Calculus: Early Vectors introduces vectors and vector functions in the ﬁrst semester and
integrates them throughout the book. It is suitable for students taking Engineering and
Physics courses concurrently with calculus.
WHAT’S NEW IN THE SIXTH EDITION?
Here are some of the changes for the sixth edition of Calculus: Early Transcendentals.
N
At the beginning of the book there are four diagnostic tests, in Basic Algebra,
Analytic Geometry, Functions, and Trigonometry. Answers are given and students
who don’t do well are referred to where they should seek help (Appendixes, review
sections of Chapter 1, and the website).
N
In response to requests of several users, the material motivating the derivative is
briefer: Sections 2.7 and 2.8 are combined into a single section called Derivatives and
Rates of Change.
N
The section on Higher Derivatives in Chapter 3 has disappeared and that material is
integrated into various sections in Chapters 2 and 3.
N
Instructors who do not cover the chapter on differential equations have commented
that the section on Exponential Growth and Decay was inconveniently located there.
Accordingly, it is moved earlier in the book, to Chapter 3. This move precipitates a
reorganization of Chapters 3 and 9.
N
Sections 4.7 and 4.8 are merged into a single section, with a briefer treatment of opti-
mization problems in business and economics.
N
Sections 11.10 and 11.11 are merged into a single section. I had previously featured
the binomial series in its own section to emphasize its importance. But I learned that
some instructors were omitting that section, so I have decided to incorporate binomial
series into 11.10.
N
The material on cylindrical and spherical coordinates (formerly Section 12.7) is moved
to Chapter 15, where it is introduced in the context of evaluating triple integrals.
N
New phrases and margin notes have been added to clarify the exposition.
N
A number of pieces of art have been redrawn.
N
The data in examples and exercises have been updated to be more timely.
N
Many examples have been added or changed. For instance, Example 2 on page 185
was changed because students are often bafﬂed when they see arbitrary constants in a
problem and I wanted to give an example in which they occur. 
N
Extra steps have been provided in some of the existing examples.
N
More than 25% of the exercises in each chapter are new. Here are a few of my
favorites: 3.1.79, 3.1.80, 4.3.62, 4.3.83, 11.6.38, 11.11.30, 14.5.44, and 14.8.20–21.
N
There are also some good new problems in the Problems Plus sections. See, for
instance, Problems 2 and 13 on page 413, Problem 13 on page 450, and Problem 24
on page 763.
N
The new project on page 550, Complementary Coffee Cups, comes from an article by
Thomas Banchoff in which he wondered which of two coffee cups, whose convex and
concave proﬁles ﬁt together snugly, would hold more coffee.

Tools for Enriching Calculus (TEC) has been completely redesigned and is accessible
on the Internet at www.stewartcalculus.com. It now includes what we call Visuals, brief
animations of various ﬁgures in the text. In addition, there are now Visual, Modules,
and Homework Hints for the multivariable chapters. See the description on page xiv.

The symbol 
has been placed beside examples (an average of three per section) for
which there are videos of instructors explaining the example in more detail. This
material is also available on DVD. See the description on page xxi.
FEATURES
CONCEPTUAL EXERCISES
The most important way to foster conceptual understanding is through the problems that
we assign. To that end I have devised various types of problems. Some exercise sets begin
with requests to explain the meanings of the basic concepts of the section. (See, for
instance, the ﬁrst few exercises in Sections 2.2, 2.5, 11.2, 14.2, and 14.3.) Similarly, all the
review sections begin with a Concept Check and a True-False Quiz. Other exercises test
conceptual understanding through graphs or tables (see Exercises 2.7.17, 2.8.33–38,
2.8.41–44, 9.1.11–12, 10.1.24–27, 11.10.2, 13.2.1–2, 13.3.33–37, 14.1.1–2, 14.1.30–38,
14.3.3–10, 14.6.1–2, 14.7.3–4, 15.1.5–10, 16.1.11–18, 16.2.17–18, and 16.3.1–2).
Another type of exercise uses verbal description to test conceptual understanding (see
Exercises 2.5.8, 2.8.56, 4.3.63–64, and 7.8.67). I particularly value problems that combine
and compare graphical, numerical, and algebraic approaches (see Exercises 2.6.37–38,
3.7.25, and 9.4.2).
GRADED EXERCISE SETS
Each exercise set is carefully graded, progressing from basic conceptual exercises and skill-
development problems to more challenging problems involving applications and proofs.
REAL-WORLD DATA
My assistants and I spent a great deal of time looking in libraries, contacting companies
and government agencies, and searching the Internet for interesting real-world data to intro-
duce, motivate, and illustrate the concepts of calculus. As a result, many of the examples
and exercises deal with functions deﬁned by such numerical data or graphs. See, for
instance, Figure 1 in Section 1.1 (seismograms from the Northridge earthquake), Exercise
2.8.34 (percentage of the population under age 18), Exercise 5.1.14 (velocity of the space
shuttle Endeavour), and Figure 4 in Section 5.4 (San Francisco power consumption).
Functions of two variables are illustrated by a table of values of the wind-chill index as a
function of air temperature and wind speed (Example 2 in Section 14.1). Partial derivatives
are introduced in Section 14.3 by examining a column in a table of values of the heat index
(perceived air temperature) as a function of the actual temperature and the relative humid-
ity. This example is pursued further in connection with linear approximations (Example 3
in Section 14.4). Directional derivatives are introduced in Section 14.6 by using a temper-
ature contour map to estimate the rate of change of temperature at Reno in the direction of
Las Vegas. Double integrals are used to estimate the average snowfall in Colorado on
December 20–21, 2006 (Example 4 in Section 15.1). Vector ﬁelds are introduced in Section
16.1 by depictions of actual velocity vector ﬁelds showing San Francisco Bay wind patterns.
PROJECTS
One way of involving students and making them active learners is to have them work (per-
haps in groups) on extended projects that give a feeling of substantial accomplishment
when completed. I have included four kinds of projects: Applied Projects involve applica-
tions that are designed to appeal to the imagination of students. The project after Section
9.3 asks whether a ball thrown upward takes longer to reach its maximum height or to fall
back to its original height. (The answer might surprise you.) The project after Section 14.8
uses Lagrange multipliers to determine the masses of the three stages of a rocket so as to 
V

||||
PREFACE
minimize the total mass while enabling the rocket to reach a desired velocity. Laboratory
Projects involve technology; the one following Section 10.2 shows how to use Bézier
curves to design shapes that represent letters for a laser printer. Writing Projects ask stu-
dents to compare present-day methods with those of the founders of calculus—Fermat’s
method for ﬁnding tangents, for instance. Suggested references are supplied. Discovery
Projects anticipate results to be discussed later or encourage discovery through pattern
recognition (see the one following Section 7.6). Others explore aspects of geometry: tetra-
hedra (after Section 12.4), hyperspheres (after Section 15.6), and intersections of three
cylinders (after Section 15.7). Additional projects can be found in the Instructor’s Guide
(see, for instance, Group Exercise 5.1: Position from Samples).
PROBLEM SOLVING
Students usually have difﬁculties with problems for which there is no single well-deﬁned
procedure for obtaining the answer. I think nobody has improved very much on George
Polya’s four-stage problem-solving strategy and, accordingly, I have included a version of
his problem-solving principles following Chapter 1. They are applied, both explicitly and
implicitly, throughout the book. After the other chapters I have placed sections called
Problems Plus, which feature examples of how to tackle challenging calculus problems. In
selecting the varied problems for these sections I kept in mind the following advice from
David Hilbert: “A mathematical problem should be difﬁcult in order to entice us, yet not
inaccessible lest it mock our efforts.” When I put these challenging problems on assign-
ments and tests I grade them in a different way. Here I reward a student signiﬁcantly for
ideas toward a solution and for recognizing which problem-solving principles are relevant.
TECHNOLOGY
The availability of technology makes it not less important but more important to clearly
understand the concepts that underlie the images on the screen. But, when properly used,
graphing calculators and computers are powerful tools for discovering and understanding
those concepts. This textbook can be used either with or without technology and I use two
special symbols to indicate clearly when a particular type of machine is required. The icon
; indicates an exercise that deﬁnitely requires the use of such technology, but that is not
to say that it can’t be used on the other exercises as well. The symbol 
is reserved for
problems in which the full resources of a computer algebra system (like Derive, Maple,
Mathematica, or the TI-89/92) are required. But technology doesn’t make pencil and paper
obsolete. Hand calculation and sketches are often preferable to technology for illustrating
and reinforcing some concepts. Both instructors and students need to develop the ability
to decide where the hand or the machine is appropriate.
TEC is a companion to the text and is intended to enrich and complement its contents. 
(It is now accessible from the Internet at www.stewartcalculus.com.) Developed by Har-
vey Keynes, Dan Clegg, Hubert Hohn, and myself, TEC uses a discovery and exploratory
approach. In sections of the book where technology is particularly appropriate, marginal
icons direct students to TEC modules that provide a laboratory environment in which they
can explore the topic in different ways and at different levels. Visuals are animations of ﬁg-
ures in text; Modules are more elaborate activities and include exercises. Instructors can
choose to become involved at several different levels, ranging from simply encouraging
students to use the Visuals and Modules for independent exploration, to assigning spe-
ciﬁc exercises from those included with each Module, or to creating additional exercises,
labs, and projects that make use of the Visuals and Modules.
TEC also includes Homework Hints for representative exercises (usually odd-
numbered) in every section of the text, indicated by printing the exercise number in red.
These hints are usually presented in the form of questions and try to imitate an effective
teaching assistant by functioning as a silent tutor. They are constructed so as not to reveal
any more of the actual solution than is minimally necessary to make further progress.

ENHANCED WEBASSIGN
Technology is having an impact on the way homework is assigned to students, particu-
larly in large classes. The use of online homework is growing and its appeal depends on
ease of use, grading precision, and reliability. With the sixth edition we have been work-
ing with the calculus community and WebAssign to develop an online homework system.
Up to 70% of the exercises in each section are assignable as online homework, including
free response, multiple choice, and multi-part formats. 
The system also includes Active Examples, in which students are guided in step-by-step
tutorials through text examples, with links to the textbook and to video solutions.
This site has been renovated and now includes the following.

CONTENT
Diagnostic Tests
The book begins with four diagnostic tests, in Basic Algebra, Analytic Geometry, Func-
tions, and Trigonometry.
A Preview of Calculus
This is an overview of the subject and includes a list of questions to motivate the study of
calculus.
1 N Functions and Models
From the beginning, multiple representations of functions are stressed: verbal, numerical,
visual, and algebraic. A discussion of mathematical models leads to a review of the standard
functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, from these four points of view.
2 N Limits and Derivatives
The material on limits is motivated by a prior discussion of the tangent and velocity prob-
lems. Limits are treated from descriptive, graphical, numerical, and algebraic points of
view. Section 2.4, on the precise ∑-∂deﬁnition of a limit, is an optional section. Sec-
tions 2.7 and 2.8 deal with derivatives (especially with functions deﬁned graphically and
numerically) before the differentiation rules are covered in Chapter 3. Here the examples
and exercises explore the meanings of derivatives in various contexts. Higher derivatives
are now introduced in Section 2.8.
3 N Differentiation Rules
All the basic functions, including exponential, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric func-
tions, are differentiated here. When derivatives are computed in applied situations, students
are asked to explain their meanings. Exponential growth and decay are now covered in this
chapter.

PREFACE
4 N Applications of Differentiation
The basic facts concerning extreme values and shapes of curves are deduced from the
Mean Value Theorem. Graphing with technology emphasizes the interaction between cal-
culus and calculators and the analysis of families of curves. Some substantial optimization
problems are provided, including an explanation of why you need to raise your head 42°
to see the top of a rainbow.
5 N Integrals
The area problem and the distance problem serve to motivate the deﬁnite integral, with
sigma notation introduced as needed. (Full coverage of sigma notation is provided in Appen-
dix E.) Emphasis is placed on explaining the meanings of integrals in various contexts and
on estimating their values from graphs and tables.
6
N Applications of Integration
Here I present the applications of integration—area, volume, work, average value—that
can reasonably be done without specialized techniques of integration. General methods are
emphasized. The goal is for students to be able to divide a quantity into small pieces, esti-
mate with Riemann sums, and recognize the limit as an integral. 
7 N Techniques of Integration
All the standard methods are covered but, of course, the real challenge is to be able to recog-
nize which technique is best used in a given situation. Accordingly, in Section 7.5, I 
present a strategy for integration. The use of computer algebra systems is discussed in 
Section 7.6.
Here are the applications of integration—arc length and surface area—for which it is use-
ful to have available all the techniques of integration, as well as applications to biology,
economics, and physics (hydrostatic force and centers of mass). I have also included a sec-
tion on probability. There are more applications here than can realistically be covered in 
a given course. Instructors should select applications suitable for their students and for
which they themselves have enthusiasm.
9 N Differential Equations
Modeling is the theme that uniﬁes this introductory treatment of differential equations.
Direction ﬁelds and Euler’s method are studied before separable and linear equations are
solved explicitly, so that qualitative, numerical, and analytic approaches are given equal
consideration. These methods are applied to the exponential, logistic, and other models 
for population growth. The ﬁrst four or ﬁve sections of this chapter serve as a good intro-
duction to ﬁrst-order differential equations. An optional ﬁnal section uses predator-prey
models to illustrate systems of differential equations.
This chapter introduces parametric and polar curves and applies the methods of calculus
to them. Parametric curves are well suited to laboratory projects; the two presented here
involve families of curves and Bézier curves. A brief treatment of conic sections in polar
coordinates prepares the way for Kepler’s Laws in Chapter 13.
11 N Infinite Sequences and Series
The convergence tests have intuitive justiﬁcations (see page 697) as well as formal proofs.
Numerical estimates of sums of series are based on which test was used to prove conver-
gence. The emphasis is on Taylor series and polynomials and their applications to physics.
Error estimates include those from graphing devices.
The material on three-dimensional analytic geometry and vectors is divided into two chap-
ters. Chapter 12 deals with vectors, the dot and cross products, lines, planes, and surfaces.

The Geometry of Space

and Polar Coordinates

13
N Vector Functions 
This chapter covers vector-valued functions, their derivatives and integrals, the length and
curvature of space curves, and velocity and acceleration along space curves, culminating
in Kepler’s laws.
14
N Partial Derivatives
Functions of two or more variables are studied from verbal, numerical, visual, and alge-
braic points of view. In particular, I introduce partial derivatives by looking at a speciﬁc
column in a table of values of the heat index (perceived air temperature) as a function of
the actual temperature and the relative humidity. Directional derivatives are estimated from
contour maps of temperature, pressure, and snowfall.
15
N Multiple Integrals
Contour maps and the Midpoint Rule are used to estimate the average snowfall and average
temperature in given regions. Double and triple integrals are used to compute probabilities,
surface areas, and (in projects) volumes of hyperspheres and volumes of intersections of
three cylinders. Cylindrical and spherical coordinates are introduced in the context of eval-
uating triple integrals.
16
N Vector Calculus
Vector ﬁelds are introduced through pictures of velocity ﬁelds showing San Francisco Bay
wind patterns. The similarities among the Fundamental Theorem for line integrals, Green’s
Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem are emphasized.
Since ﬁrst-order differential equations are covered in Chapter 9, this ﬁnal chapter deals
with second-order linear differential equations, their application to vibrating springs and
electric circuits, and series solutions.
ANCILLARIES
Calculus, Early Transcendentals, Sixth Edition, is supported by a complete set of ancil-
laries developed under my direction. Each piece has been designed to enhance student
understanding and to facilitate creative instruction. The tables on pages xxi–xxii describe
each of these ancillaries.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The preparation of this and previous editions has involved much time spent reading the
reasoned (but sometimes contradictory) advice from a large number of astute reviewers. 
I greatly appreciate the time they spent to understand my motivation for the approach taken.
I have learned something from each of them.

Reading a calculus textbook is different from reading a news-
paper or a novel, or even a physics book. Don’t be discouraged
if you have to read a passage more than once in order to under-
stand it. You should have pencil and paper and calculator at
hand to sketch a diagram or make a calculation.
Some students start by trying their homework problems and
read the text only if they get stuck on an exercise. I suggest that
a far better plan is to read and understand a section of the text
before attempting the exercises. In particular, you should look 
at the deﬁnitions to see the exact meanings of the terms. And
before you read each example, I suggest that you cover up the
solution and try solving the problem yourself. You’ll get a lot
more from looking at the solution if you do so.
Part of the aim of this course is to train you to think logically.
Learn to write the solutions of the exercises in a connected,
step-by-step fashion with explanatory sentences—not just a
string of disconnected equations or formulas.
The answers to the odd-numbered exercises appear at the
back of the book, in Appendix I. Some exercises ask for a ver-
bal explanation or interpretation or description. In such cases
there is no single correct way of expressing the answer, so don’t
worry that you haven’t found the deﬁnitive answer. In addition,
there are often several different forms in which to express a
numerical or algebraic answer, so if your answer differs from
mine, don’t immediately assume you’re wrong. For example,
if the answer given in the back of the book is 
and you
obtain 
, then you’re right and rationalizing the
denominator will show that the answers are equivalent.
The icon ; indicates an exercise that deﬁnitely requires 
the use of either a graphing calculator or a computer with
graphing software. (Section 1.4 discusses the use of these
graphing devices and some of the pitfalls that you may
encounter.) But that doesn’t mean that graphing devices can’t
be used to check your work on the other exercises as well. The
symbol 
is reserved for problems in which the full resources
CAS
1(1  s 2)
s 2  1
of a computer algebra system (like Derive, Maple, Mathe-
matica, or the TI-89/92) are required.
You will also encounter the symbol |, which warns you
against committing an error. I have placed this symbol in the
margin in situations where I have observed that a large propor-
tion of my students tend to make the same mistake.
Tools for Enriching Calculus, which is a companion to this
text, is referred to by means of the symbol 
and can be
accessed from www.stewartcalculus.com. It directs you to mod-
ules in which you can explore aspects of calculus for which the
computer is particularly useful. TEC also provides Homework
Hints for representative exercises that are indicated by printing
the exercise number in red:
These homework hints ask you
questions that allow you to make progress toward a solution
without actually giving you the answer. You need to pursue
each hint in an active manner with pencil and paper to work 
out the details. If a particular hint doesn’t enable you to solve
the problem, you can click to reveal the next hint. 
An optional CD-ROM that your instructor may have asked
you to purchase is the Interactive Video Skillbuilder, which con-
tains videos of instructors explaining two or three of the exam-
ples in every section of the text. Also on the CD is a video in
which I offer advice on how to succeed in your calculus course.
I recommend that you keep this book for reference purposes
after you ﬁnish the course. Because you will likely forget some
of the speciﬁc details of calculus, the book will serve as a 
useful reminder when you need to use calculus in subsequent
courses. And, because this book contains more material than
can be covered in any one course, it can also serve as a valuable
resource for a working scientist or engineer.
Calculus is an exciting subject, justly considered to be one
of the greatest achievements of the human intellect. I hope you
will discover that it is not only useful but also intrinsically
beautiful.

Calculus is fundamentally different from the mathematics that you have studied pre-
viously: calculus is less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with change and
motion; it deals with quantities that approach other quantities. For that reason it may 
be useful to have an overview of the subject before beginning its intensive study. Here
we give a glimpse of some of the main ideas of calculus by showing how the concept 
of a limit arises when we attempt to solve a variety of problems.
A PREVIEW 
OF CALCULUS

THE AREA PROBLEM
The origins of calculus go back at least 2500 years to the ancient Greeks, who found areas
using the “method of exhaustion.” They knew how to ﬁnd the area 
of any polygon by
dividing it into triangles as in Figure 1 and adding the areas of these triangles.
It is a much more difﬁcult problem to ﬁnd the area of a curved ﬁgure. The Greek
method of exhaustion was to inscribe polygons in the ﬁgure and circumscribe polygons
about the ﬁgure and then let the number of sides of the polygons increase. Figure 2 illus-
trates this process for the special case of a circle with inscribed regular polygons.
Let 
be the area of the inscribed polygon with sides. As increases, it appears that
becomes closer and closer to the area of the circle. We say that the area of the circle is
the limit of the areas of the inscribed polygons, and we write
The Greeks themselves did not use limits explicitly. However, by indirect reasoning,
Eudoxus (ﬁfth century BC) used exhaustion to prove the familiar formula for the area of a
circle:
We will use a similar idea in Chapter 5 to ﬁnd areas of regions of the type shown in Fig-
ure 3. We will approximate the desired area 
by areas of rectangles (as in Figure 4), let
the width of the rectangles decrease, and then calculate 
as the limit of these sums of
areas of rectangles.
The area problem is the central problem in the branch of calculus called integral cal-
culus. The techniques that we will develop in Chapter 5 for ﬁnding areas will also enable
us to compute the volume of a solid, the length of a curve, the force of water against a dam,
the mass and center of gravity of a rod, and the work done in pumping water out of a tank.

THE TANGENT PROBLEM
Consider the problem of trying to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line 
to a curve with
equation 
at a given point . (We will give a precise deﬁnition of a tangent line in
Chapter 2. For now you can think of it as a line that touches the curve at 
as in Figure 5.)
Since we know that the point 
lies on the tangent line, we can ﬁnd the equation of if we
know its slope 
. The problem is that we need two points to compute the slope and we
know only one point,
, on . To get around the problem we ﬁrst ﬁnd an approximation to
by taking a nearby point 
on the curve and computing the slope 
of the secant line
. From Figure 6 we see that
Now imagine that 
moves along the curve toward 
as in Figure 7. You can see that
the secant line rotates and approaches the tangent line as its limiting position. This means
that the slope 
of the secant line becomes closer and closer to the slope 
of the tan-
gent line. We write
and we say that
is the limit of
as
approaches
along the curve. Since
approaches
as 
approaches , we could also use Equation 1 to write
Speciﬁc examples of this procedure will be given in Chapter 2.
The tangent problem has given rise to the branch of calculus called differential calcu-
lus, which was not invented until more than 2000 years after integral calculus. The main
ideas behind differential calculus are due to the French mathematician Pierre Fermat
(1601–1665) and were developed by the English mathematicians John Wallis
(1616–1703), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and the German
mathematician Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716).
The two branches of calculus and their chief problems, the area problem and the tan-
gent problem, appear to be very different, but it turns out that there is a very close connec-
tion between them. The tangent problem and the area problem are inverse problems in a
sense that will be described in Chapter 5.
VELOCITY
When we look at the speedometer of a car and read that the car is traveling at 48 mih,
what does that information indicate to us? We know that if the velocity remains constant,
then after an hour we will have traveled 48 mi. But if the velocity of the car varies, what
does it mean to say that the velocity at a given instant is 48 mih?
In order to analyze this question, let’s examine the motion of a car that travels along a
straight road and assume that we can measure the distance traveled by the car (in feet) at
l-second intervals as in the following chart:

As a ﬁrst step toward ﬁnding the velocity after 2 seconds have elapsed, we ﬁnd the aver-
age velocity during the time interval 
:
Similarly, the average velocity in the time interval 
is
We have the feeling that the velocity at the instant  2 can’t be much different from the
average velocity during a short time interval starting at 
. So let’s imagine that the dis-
tance traveled has been measured at 0.l-second time intervals as in the following chart:
Then we can compute, for instance, the average velocity over the time interval 
:
The results of such calculations are shown in the following chart:
The average velocities over successively smaller intervals appear to be getting closer to
a number near 10, and so we expect that the velocity at exactly 
is about 10 fts. In
Chapter 2 we will deﬁne the instantaneous velocity of a moving object as the limiting
value of the average velocities over smaller and smaller time intervals.
In Figure 8 we show a graphical representation of the motion of the car by plotting the
distance traveled as a function of time. If we write 
, then 
is the number of feet
traveled after seconds. The average velocity in the time interval 
is
which is the same as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 8. The velocity when 
is the limiting value of this average velocity as approaches 2; that is,
and we recognize from Equation 2 that this is the same as the slope of the tangent line to
the curve at .

Thus, when we solve the tangent problem in differential calculus, we are also solving
problems concerning velocities. The same techniques also enable us to solve problems
involving rates of change in all of the natural and social sciences.
THE LIMIT OF A SEQUENCE
In the ﬁfth century BC the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea posed four problems, now
known as Zeno’s paradoxes, that were intended to challenge some of the ideas concerning
space and time that were held in his day. Zeno’s second paradox concerns a race between
the Greek hero Achilles and a tortoise that has been given a head start. Zeno argued, as fol-
lows, that Achilles could never pass the tortoise: Suppose that Achilles starts at position 
and the tortoise starts at position . (See Figure 9.) When Achilles reaches the point
, the tortoise is farther ahead at position . When Achilles reaches 
, the tor-
toise is at . This process continues indeﬁnitely and so it appears that the tortoise will
always be ahead! But this deﬁes common sense.
One way of explaining this paradox is with the idea of a sequence. The successive posi-
tions of Achilles 
or the successive positions of the tortoise 
form what is known as a sequence.
In general, a sequence 
is a set of numbers written in a deﬁnite order. For instance,
the sequence
can be described by giving the following formula for the th term:
We can visualize this sequence by plotting its terms on a number line as in Fig-
ure 10(a) or by drawing its graph as in Figure 10(b). Observe from either picture that the
terms of the sequence 
are becoming closer and closer to 0 as increases. In fact,
we can ﬁnd terms as small as we please by making 
large enough. We say that the limit
of the sequence is 0, and we indicate this by writing
In general, the notation
is used if the terms 
approach the number as becomes large. This means that the num-
bers 
can be made as close as we like to the number 
by taking 
sufﬁciently large.

The concept of the limit of a sequence occurs whenever we use the decimal represen-
tation of a real number. For instance, if
then
The terms in this sequence are rational approximations to .
Let’s return to Zeno’s paradox. The successive positions of Achilles and the tortoise
form sequences 
and 
, where 
for all . It can be shown that both sequences
have the same limit:
It is precisely at this point 
that Achilles overtakes the tortoise.
THE SUM OF A SERIES
Another of Zeno’s paradoxes, as passed on to us by Aristotle, is the following: “A man
standing in a room cannot walk to the wall. In order to do so, he would ﬁrst have to go half
the distance, then half the remaining distance, and then again half of what still remains.
This process can always be continued and can never be ended.” (See Figure 11.)
Of course, we know that the man can actually reach the wall, so this suggests that per-
haps the total distance can be expressed as the sum of inﬁnitely many smaller distances as
follows:

Zeno was arguing that it doesn’t make sense to add inﬁnitely many numbers together. But
there are other situations in which we implicitly use inﬁnite sums. For instance, in decimal
notation, the symbol 
means
and so, in some sense, it must be true that
More generally, if 
denotes the nth digit in the decimal representation of a number, then
Therefore some inﬁnite sums, or inﬁnite series as they are called, have a meaning. But we
must deﬁne carefully what the sum of an inﬁnite series is.
Returning to the series in Equation 3, we denote by 
the sum of the ﬁrst terms of the
series. Thus
Observe that as we add more and more terms, the partial sums become closer and closer
to 1. In fact, it can be shown that by taking 
large enough (that is, by adding sufﬁciently
many terms of the series), we can make the partial sum 
as close as we please to the num-
ber 1. It therefore seems reasonable to say that the sum of the inﬁnite series is 1 and to
write

A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS

In other words, the reason the sum of the series is 1 is that
In Chapter 11 we will discuss these ideas further. We will then use Newton’s idea of
combining inﬁnite series with differential and integral calculus.
SUMMARY
We have seen that the concept of a limit arises in trying to ﬁnd the area of a region, the
slope of a tangent to a curve, the velocity of a car, or the sum of an inﬁnite series. In each
case the common theme is the calculation of a quantity as the limit of other, easily calcu-
lated quantities. It is this basic idea of a limit that sets calculus apart from other areas of
mathematics. In fact, we could deﬁne calculus as the part of mathematics that deals with
limits.
After Sir Isaac Newton invented his version of calculus, he used it to explain the motion
of the planets around the sun. Today calculus is used in calculating the orbits of satellites
and spacecraft, in predicting population sizes, in estimating how fast coffee prices rise, in
forecasting weather, in measuring the cardiac output of the heart, in calculating life insur-
ance premiums, and in a great variety of other areas. We will explore some of these uses
of calculus in this book.
In order to convey a sense of the power of the subject, we end this preview with a list
of some of the questions that you will be able to answer using calculus:
1. How can we explain the fact, illustrated in Figure 12, that the angle of elevation
from an observer up to the highest point in a rainbow is 42°? (See page 279.)
2. How can we explain the shapes of cans on supermarket shelves? (See page 333.)
3. Where is the best place to sit in a movie theater? (See page 446.)
4. How far away from an airport should a pilot start descent? (See page 206.)
5. How can we ﬁt curves together to design shapes to represent letters on a laser
printer? (See page 639.)
6. Where should an inﬁelder position himself to catch a baseball thrown by an out-
ﬁelder and relay it to home plate? (See page 601.)
7. Does a ball thrown upward take longer to reach its maximum height or to fall
back to its original height? (See page 590.)
8. How can we explain the fact that planets and satellites move in elliptical orbits?
(See page 844.)
9. How can we distribute water ﬂow among turbines at a hydroelectric station so as
to maximize the total energy production? (See page 943.)
10. If a marble, a squash ball, a steel bar, and a lead pipe roll down a slope, which of
them reaches the bottom ﬁrst? (See page 1012.)

The fundamental objects that we deal with in calculus are functions. This chapter
prepares the way for calculus by discussing the basic ideas concerning functions, their
graphs, and ways of transforming and combining them. We stress that a function can be
represented in different ways: by an equation, in a table, by a graph, or in words. We
look at the main types of functions that occur in calculus and describe the process of
using these functions as mathematical models of real-world phenomena. We also discuss
the use of graphing calculators and graphing software for computers.
A graphical representation of a 
function––here the number of 
hours of daylight as a function 
of the time of year at various 
latitudes––is often the most 
natural and convenient way to 
represent the function.

FOUR WAYS TO REPRESENT A FUNCTION
Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following four
situations.
A. The area 
of a circle depends on the radius of the circle. The rule that connects 
and 
is given by the equation 
. With each positive number there is associ-
ated one value of , and we say that 
is a function of .
B. The human population of the world 
depends on the time . The table gives estimates
of the world population 
at time 
for certain years. For instance,
But for each value of the time there is a corresponding value of 
and we say that 
is a function of .
C. The cost 
of mailing a ﬁrst-class letter depends on the weight 
of the letter.
Although there is no simple formula that connects 
and , the post ofﬁce has a rule
for determining 
when 
is known.
D. The vertical acceleration of the ground as measured by a seismograph during an
earthquake is a function of the elapsed time 
Figure 1 shows a graph generated by
seismic activity during the Northridge earthquake that shook Los Angeles in 1994.
For a given value of 
the graph provides a corresponding value of .
Each of these examples describes a rule whereby, given a number ( , ,
, or ), another
number ( ,
,
, or ) is assigned. In each case we say that the second number is a func-
tion of the ﬁrst number.
A function
is a rule that assigns to each element in a set 
exactly one ele-
ment, called 
, in a set .
We usually consider functions for which the sets 
and 
are sets of real numbers. The
set 
is called the domain of the function. The number 
is the value of 
at
and is
read “
of .” The range of 
is the set of all possible values of 
as varies through-
out the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function
is called an independent variable. A symbol that represents a number in the range of 
is called a dependent variable. In Example A, for instance, r is the independent variable
and A is the dependent variable.

It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If is in the domain of
the function 
then when enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the machine
produces an output 
according to the rule of the function. Thus we can think of the
domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs.
The preprogrammed functions in a calculator are good examples of a function as a
machine. For example, the square root key on your calculator computes such a function.
You press the key labeled 
(or 
) and enter the input x. If 
, then is not in the
domain of this function; that is,
is not an acceptable input, and the calculator will indi-
cate an error. If 
, then an approximation to 
will appear in the display. Thus the
key on your calculator is not quite the same as the exact mathematical function deﬁned
by 
.
Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each arrow
connects an element of 
to an element of . The arrow indicates that 
is associated
with 
is associated with , and so on.
The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph. If 
is a function with
domain , then its graph is the set of ordered pairs
(Notice that these are input-output pairs.) In other words, the graph of 
consists of all
points 
in the coordinate plane such that 
and is in the domain of .
The graph of a function 
gives us a useful picture of the behavior or “life history” of
a function. Since the -coordinate of any point 
on the graph is 
, we can read
the value of 
from the graph as being the height of the graph above the point 
(see
Figure 4). The graph of 
also allows us to picture the domain of 
on the -axis and its
range on the -axis as in Figure 5.
EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function 
is shown in Figure 6.

SOLUTION
(a) We see from Figure 6 that the point 
lies on the graph of , so the value of
at 1 is 
. (In other words, the point on the graph that lies above x ! 1 is 3 units
above the x-axis.)
When x ! 5, the graph lies about 0.7 unit below the x-axis, so we estimate that
.
(b) We see that

val

all numbers of the form

REPRESENTATIONS OF FUNCTIONS
There are four possible ways to represent a function:
I verbally
(by a description in words)
I numerically
(by a table of values)
I visually
(by a graph)
I algebraically
(by an explicit formula)
If a single function can be represented in all four ways, it’s often useful to go from one
representation to another to gain additional insight into the function. (In Example 2, for
instance, we started with algebraic formulas and then obtained the graphs.) But certain

functions are described more naturally by one method than by another. With this in mind,
let’s reexamine the four situations that we considered at the beginning of this section.
A. The most useful representation of the area of a circle as a function of its radius is
probably the algebraic formula 
, though it is possible to compile a table of
values or to sketch a graph (half a parabola). Because a circle has to have a positive
radius, the domain is 
, and the range is also 
.
B. We are given a description of the function in words:
is the human population of
the world at time t. The table of values of world population provides a convenient
representation of this function. If we plot these values, we get the graph (called a
scatter plot) in Figure 9. It too is a useful representation; the graph allows us to
absorb all the data at once. What about a formula? Of course, it’s impossible to devise
an explicit formula that gives the exact human population 
at any time t. But it is
possible to ﬁnd an expression for a function that approximates 
. In fact, using
methods explained in Section 1.2, we obtain the approximation
and Figure 10 shows that it is a reasonably good “ﬁt.” The function 
is called a
mathematical model for population growth. In other words, it is a function with an
explicit formula that approximates the behavior of our given function. We will see,
however, that the ideas of calculus can be applied to a table of values; an explicit
formula is not necessary.
The function 
is typical of the functions that arise whenever we attempt to apply
calculus to the real world. We start with a verbal description of a function. Then we
may be able to construct a table of values of the function, perhaps from instrument
readings in a scientiﬁc experiment. Even though we don’t have complete knowledge
of the values of the function, we will see throughout the book that it is still possible to
perform the operations of calculus on such a function.
C. Again the function is described in words:
is the cost of mailing a ﬁrst-class letter
with weight . The rule that the US Postal Service used as of 2007 is as follows: The
cost is 39 cents for up to one ounce, plus 24 cents for each successive ounce up to 13
ounces. The table of values shown in the margin is the most convenient representation
for this function, though it is possible to sketch a graph (see Example 10).
D. The graph shown in Figure 1 is the most natural representation of the vertical acceler-
ation function 
. It’s true that a table of values could be compiled, and it is even

possible to devise an approximate formula. But everything a geologist needs to
know—amplitudes and patterns—can be seen easily from the graph. (The same is
true for the patterns seen in electrocardiograms of heart patients and polygraphs for
lie-detection.)
In the next example we sketch the graph of a function that is deﬁned verbally.

of the time that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on.
SOLUTION The initial temperature of the running water is close to room temperature
because the water has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot-water tank
starts ﬂowing from the faucet,
increases quickly. In the next phase,
is constant at the
temperature of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is drained,
decreases to 
the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make the rough sketch of 
as a
function of in Figure 11.
M
In the following example we start with a verbal description of a function in a physical
situation and obtain an explicit algebraic formula. The ability to do this is a useful skill in
solving calculus problems that ask for the maximum or minimum values of quantities.
EXAMPLE 5 A rectangular storage container with an open top has a volume of 10 m .
The length of its base is twice its width. Material for the base costs $10 per square
meter; material for the sides costs $6 per square meter. Express the cost of materials as a
function of the width of the base.
SOLUTION We draw a diagram as in Figure 12 and introduce notation by letting
and
be the width and length of the base, respectively, and be the height.
The area of the base is 
, so the cost, in dollars, of the material for the
base is 
. Two of the sides have area 
and the other two have area 
, so the
cost of the material for the sides is 
. The total cost is therefore
To express 
as a function of 
alone, we need to eliminate and we do so by using the
fact that the volume is 10 m . Thus
which gives
Substituting this into the expression for , we have
Therefore, the equation
expresses 
as a function of .

SOLUTION
(a) Because the square root of a negative number is not deﬁned (as a real number),
the domain of 
consists of all values of x such that 
. This is equivalent to
, so the domain is the interval 
.
(b) Since

Thus the domain of is

The graph of a function is a curve in the 
-plane. But the question arises: Which curves
in the 
-plane are graphs of functions? This is answered by the following test.
THE VERTICAL LINE TEST A curve in the 
-plane is the graph of a function of if
and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.
The reason for the truth of the Vertical Line Test can be seen in Figure 13. If each ver-
tical line 
intersects a curve only once, at 
, then exactly one functional value 
is deﬁned by 
. But if a line 
intersects the curve twice, at 
and 
,
then the curve can’t represent a function because a function can’t assign two different val-
ues to .
For example, the parabola 
shown in Figure 14(a) on the next page is not the
graph of a function of 
because, as you can see, there are vertical lines that intersect the
parabola twice. The parabola, however, does contain the graphs of two functions of .
Notice that the equation 
implies 
, so 
Thus the
upper and lower halves of the parabola are the graphs of the functions 
[from Example 6(a)] and 
. [See Figures 14(b) and (c).] We observe that
if we reverse the roles of and , then the equation 
does deﬁne as a
function of (with as the independent variable and as the dependent variable) and the
parabola now appears as the graph of the function .h

CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
N If a function is given by a formula and the
domain is not stated explicitly, the convention is
that the domain is the set of all numbers for
which the formula makes sense and deﬁnes a
real number.

PIECEWISE DEFINED FUNCTIONS
The functions in the following four examples are deﬁned by different formulas in differ-
ent parts of their domains.
EXAMPLE 7 A function 
is deﬁned by
Evaluate 
,
, and 
and sketch the graph.
SOLUTION Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule is the
following: First look at the value of the input . If it happens that 
, then the value
of 
is 
. On the other hand, if 
, then the value of 
is 
.
How do we draw the graph of ? We observe that if 
, then 
, so the
part of the graph of 
that lies to the left of the vertical line 
must coincide with
the line 
, which has slope 
and -intercept 1. If 
, then 
, so
the part of the graph of 
that lies to the right of the line 
must coincide with the
graph of 
, which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the graph in Figure 15.
The solid dot indicates that the point 
is included on the graph; the open dot indi-
cates that the point 
is excluded from the graph.
M
The next example of a piecewise deﬁned function is the absolute value function. Recall
that the absolute value of a number , denoted by 
, is the distance from 
to 
on the
real number line. Distances are always positive or , so we have
for every number

The line through

So we have
We also see that the graph of

tion together, we have the following three-piece formula for :

The graph is shown in Figure 18. You can see why functions similar to this one are
called step functions—they jump from one value to the next. Such functions will be
studied in Chapter 2.

SYMMETRY
If a function 
satisﬁes 
for every number in its domain, then 
is called an
even function. For instance, the function 
is even because
The geometric signiﬁcance of an even function is that its graph is symmetric with respect
to the -axis (see Figure 19). This means that if we have plotted the graph of 
for 
,
we obtain the entire graph simply by reﬂecting this portion about the -axis.
If 
satisﬁes 
for every number in its domain, then 
is called an odd
function. For example, the function 
is odd because
The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 20). If we  already
have the graph of 
for 
, we can obtain the entire graph by rotating this portion
through 
about the origin.
EXAMPLE 11 Determine whether each of the following functions is even, odd, or
neither even nor odd.
(a)
(b)
(c)
SOLUTION
(a)
Therefore 
is an odd function.
(b)
So is even.
(c)
Since 
and 
, we conclude that is neither even nor odd.
M
The graphs of the functions in Example 11 are shown in Figure 21. Notice that the
graph of h is symmetric neither about the y-axis nor about the origin.

INCREASING AND DECREASING FUNCTIONS
The graph shown in Figure 22 rises from 
to , falls from 
to , and rises again from 
to . The function is said to be increasing on the interval 
, decreasing on 
, and
increasing again on 
. Notice that if 
and 
are any two numbers between 
and 
with 
, then 
. We use this as the deﬁning property of an increasing
function.
A function 
is called increasing on an interval if
It is called decreasing on if
In the deﬁnition of an increasing function it is important to realize that the inequality
must be satisﬁed for every pair of numbers 
and 
in with 
.
You can see from Figure 23 that the function 
is decreasing on the interval
and increasing on the interval

MATHEMATICAL MODELS: A CATALOG OF ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS
A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an
equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a
product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reac-
tion, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The pur-
pose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about
future behavior.
Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world problem,
our ﬁrst task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the inde-
pendent and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phenomenon
enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the physical situa-
tion and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the variables. In situations
where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect data (either from a
library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and examine the data in the
form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numerical representation of a func-
tion we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by plotting the data. The graph
might even suggest a suitable algebraic formula in some cases.
The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that
will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have formu-
lated in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we take those
mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world
phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The ﬁnal step is to
test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions don’t compare
well with reality, we need to reﬁne our model or to formulate a new model and start the
cycle again.
A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situ-
ation—it is an idealization. A good model simpliﬁes reality enough to permit mathemati-
cal calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It is important to
realize the limitations of the model. In the end, Mother Nature has the ﬁnal say.
There are many different types of functions that can be used to model relationships
observed in the real world. In what follows, we discuss the behavior and graphs of these 
functions and give examples of situations appropriately modeled by such functions.
LINEAR MODELS
When we say that y is a linear function of x, we mean that the graph of the function is a
line, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to write a formula for
the function as
where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.

CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
N The coordinate geometry of lines is reviewed
in Appendix B.

A characteristic feature of linear functions is that they grow at a constant rate. For
instance, Figure 2 shows a graph of the linear function 
and a table of sam-
ple values. Notice that whenever x increases by 0.1, the value of 
increases by 0.3. So
increases three times as fast as x. Thus the slope of the graph 
, namely 3, can
be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) As dry air moves upward, it expands and cools. If the ground temperature is 
and the temperature at a height of 1 km is 
, express the temperature T (in °C) as a
function of the height h (in kilometers), assuming that a linear model is appropriate.
(b) Draw the graph of the function in part (a). What does the slope represent?
(c) What is the temperature at a height of 2.5 km?
SOLUTION
(a) Because we are assuming that T is a linear function of h, we can write
We are given that 
when 
, so
In other words, the y-intercept is 
.
We are also given that 
when 
, so
The slope of the line is therefore
and the required linear function is
(b) The graph is sketched in Figure 3. The slope is 
, and this represents
the rate of change of temperature with respect to height.
(c) At a height of 
, the temperature is
M
If there is no physical law or principle to help us formulate a model, we construct an
empirical model, which is based entirely on collected data. We seek a curve that “ﬁts” the
data in the sense that it captures the basic trend of the data points.

EXAMPLE 2 Table 1 lists the average carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere, measured
in parts per million at Mauna Loa Observatory from 1980 to 2002. Use the data in
Table 1 to ﬁnd a model for the carbon dioxide level.
SOLUTION We use the data in Table 1 to make the scatter plot in Figure 4, where t repre-
sents time (in years) and C represents the 
level (in parts per million, ppm).
Notice that the data points appear to lie close to a straight line, so it’s natural to
choose a linear model in this case. But there are many possible lines that approximate
these data points, so which one should we use? From the graph, it appears that one possi-
bility is the line that passes through the ﬁrst and last data points. The slope of this line is
and its equation is
or
Equation 1 gives one possible linear model for the carbon dioxide level; it is graphed
in Figure 5.
Although our model ﬁts the data reasonably well, it gives values higher than most of
the actual 
levels. A better linear model is obtained by a procedure from statistics

called linear regression. If we use a graphing calculator, we enter the data from Table 1
into the data editor and choose the linear regression command. (With Maple we use the
ﬁt[leastsquare] command in the stats package; with Mathematica we use the Fit com-
mand.) The machine gives the slope and y-intercept of the regression line as
So our least squares model for the 
level is
In Figure 6 we graph the regression line as well as the data points. Comparing with
Figure 5, we see that it gives a better ﬁt than our previous linear model.

EXAMPLE 3 Use the linear model given by Equation 2 to estimate the average 
level for 1987 and to predict the level for the year 2010. According to this model, when
will the 
level exceed 400 parts per million?
SOLUTION Using Equation 2 with t ! 1987, we estimate that the average 
level in 1987
was
This is an example of interpolation because we have estimated a value between observed
values. (In fact, the Mauna Loa Observatory reported that the average 
level in 1987
was 348.93 ppm, so our estimate is quite accurate.)
With 
, we get
So we predict that the average 
level in the year 2010 will be 384.8 ppm. This is 
an example of extrapolation because we have predicted a value outside the region of
observations. Consequently, we are far less certain about the accuracy of our prediction.
Using Equation 2, we see that the 
level exceeds 400 ppm when
Solving this inequality, we get

N A computer or graphing calculator ﬁnds the
regression line by the method of least squares,
which is to minimize the sum of the squares of the
vertical distances between the data points and the
line. The details are explained in Section 14.7.

We therefore predict that the 
level will exceed 400 ppm by the year 2019. This 
prediction is somewhat risky because it involves a time quite remote from our 
observations.
M
POLYNOMIALS
A function 
is called a polynomial if
where is a nonnegative integer and the numbers 
are constants called the
coefﬁcients of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is 
If the 
leading coefﬁcient 
, then the degree of the polynomial is . For example, the 
function
is a polynomial of degree 6.
A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form 
and so it is a linear function.
A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form 
and is called a quadratic
function. Its graph is always a parabola obtained by shifting the parabola 
, as we
will see in the next section. The parabola opens upward if 
and downward if 
.
(See Figure 7.)
A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form
and is called a cubic function. Figure 8 shows the graph of a cubic function in part (a) and
graphs of polynomials of degrees 4 and 5 in parts (b) and (c). We will see later why the
graphs have these shapes.

CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS

Polynomials are commonly used to model various quantities that occur in the natural
and social sciences. For instance, in Section 3.7 we will explain why economists often use
a polynomial 
to represent the cost of producing units of a commodity. In the follow-
ing example we use a quadratic function to model the fall of a ball.
EXAMPLE 4 A ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN Tower, 450 m
above the ground, and its height h above the ground is recorded at 1-second intervals in
Table 2. Find a model to ﬁt the data and use the model to predict the time at which the
ball hits the ground.
SOLUTION We draw a scatter plot of the data in Figure 9 and observe that a linear model is
inappropriate. But it looks as if the data points might lie on a parabola, so we try a quad-
ratic model instead. Using a graphing calculator or computer algebra system (which uses
the least squares method), we obtain the following quadratic model:
In Figure 10 we plot the graph of Equation 3 together with the data points and see
that the quadratic model gives a very good ﬁt.
The ball hits the ground when 
, so we solve the quadratic equation
The quadratic formula gives
The positive root is 
, so we predict that the ball will hit the ground after about
9.7 seconds.

POWER FUNCTIONS
A function of the form 
, where 
is a constant, is called a power function. We
consider several cases.

The general shape of the graph of

If is odd, then

The graph of the reciprocal function
is shown in Figure 14. Its graph
has the equation 
, or 
, and is a hyperbola with the coordinate axes as its
asymptotes. This function arises in physics and chemistry in connection with Boyle’s
Law, which says that, when the temperature is constant, the volume 
of a gas is
inversely proportional to the pressure :
where C is a constant. Thus the graph of V as a function of P (see Figure 15) has the
same general shape as the right half of Figure 14.
Another instance in which a power function is used to model a physical phenomenon
is discussed in Exercise 26.
RATIONAL FUNCTIONS
A rational function
is a ratio of two polynomials:
where
and
are polynomials. The domain consists of all values of
such that
.
A simple example of a rational function is the function 
, whose domain is
; this is the reciprocal function graphed in Figure 14. The function
is a rational function with domain 
. Its graph is shown in Figure 16.
ALGEBRAIC FUNCTIONS
A function is called an algebraic function if it can be constructed using algebraic oper-
ations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots) starting
with polynomials. Any rational function is automatically an algebraic function. Here are
two more examples:

When we sketch algebraic functions in Chapter 4, we will see that their graphs can assume
a variety of shapes. Figure 17 illustrates some of the possibilities.
An example of an algebraic function occurs in the theory of relativity. The mass of a
particle with velocity is
where 
is the rest mass of the particle and 
km$s is the speed of light in
a vacuum.
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Trigonometry and the trigonometric functions are reviewed on Reference Page 2 and also
in Appendix D. In calculus the convention is that radian measure is always used (except
when otherwise indicated). For example, when we use the function 
, it is under-
stood that 
means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is . Thus the graphs of
the sine and cosine functions are as shown in Figure 18.
Notice that for both the sine and cosine functions the domain is 
and the range
is the closed interval 
. Thus, for all values of , we have

An important property of the sine and cosine functions is that they are periodic func-
tions and have period 
. This means that, for all values of ,
The periodic nature of these functions makes them suitable for modeling repetitive phe-
nomena such as tides, vibrating springs, and sound waves. For instance, in Example 4 in
Section 1.3 we will see that a reasonable model for the number of hours of daylight in
Philadelphia t days after January 1 is given by the function
The tangent function is related to the sine and cosine functions by the equation
and its graph is shown in Figure 19. It is undeﬁned whenever 
, that is, when
,
Its range is
. Notice that the tangent function has period
:
The remaining three trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, and cotangent) are 
the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Their graphs are shown in
Appendix D.
EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
The exponential functions are the functions of the form 
, where the base 
is a
positive constant. The graphs of 
and 
are shown in Figure 20. In both
cases the domain is 
and the range is 
.
Exponential functions will be studied in detail in Section 1.5, and we will see that they
are useful for modeling many natural phenomena, such as population growth (if

LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS
The logarithmic functions
, where the base 
is a positive constant, are the
inverse functions of the exponential functions. They will be studied in Section 1.6. Fig-
ure 21 shows the graphs of four logarithmic functions with various bases. In each case the
domain is 
, the range is 
, and the function increases slowly when 
.
TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS
These are functions that are not algebraic. The set of transcendental functions includes the
trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, but it also
includes a vast number of other functions that have never been named. In Chapter 11 we
will study transcendental functions that are deﬁned as sums of inﬁnite series.

NEW FUNCTIONS FROM OLD FUNCTIONS
In this section we start with the basic functions we discussed in Section 1.2 and obtain new
functions by shifting, stretching, and reﬂecting their graphs. We also show how to combine
pairs of functions by the standard arithmetic operations and by composition.
TRANSFORMATIONS OF FUNCTIONS
By applying certain transformations to the graph of a given function we can obtain the
graphs of certain related functions. This will give us the ability to sketch the graphs of
many functions quickly by hand. It will also enable us to write equations for given graphs.
Let’s ﬁrst consider translations. If c is a positive number, then the graph of 
is
just the graph of 
shifted upward a distance of c units (because each y-coordinate
is increased by the same number c). Likewise, if 
, where 
, then the
value of 
at x is the same as the value of 
at 
(c units to the left of x). Therefore,
the graph of 
is just the graph of 
shifted 
units to the right (see
Figure 1).
VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL SHIFTS Suppose 
. To obtain the graph of
 y ! f!x % c", shift the graph of y ! f!x" a distance c units to the left
 y ! f!x $ c", shift the graph of y ! f!x" a distance c units to the right

1.3

Now let’s consider the stretching and reﬂecting transformations. If 
, then the
graph of 
is the graph of 
stretched by a factor of c in the vertical 
direction (because each y-coordinate is multiplied by the same number c). The graph of
is the graph of 
reﬂected about the -axis because the point 
is
replaced by the point 
. (See Figure 2 and the following chart, where the results of
other stretching, compressing, and reﬂecting transformations are also given.)
VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL STRETCHING AND REFLECTING Suppose 
. To
obtain the graph of
Figure 3 illustrates these stretching transformations when applied to the cosine function
with 
. For instance, in order to get the graph of 
we multiply the y-coor-
dinate of each point on the graph of 
by 2. This means that the graph of 
gets stretched vertically by a factor of 2.

SOLUTION The graph of the square root function 
, obtained from Figure 13(a) 
in Section 1.2, is shown in Figure 4(a). In the other parts of the ﬁgure we sketch
by shifting 2 units downward, 
by shifting 2 units to the right,

by reﬂecting about the -axis.

EXAMPLE 4 Figure 9 shows graphs of the number of hours of daylight as functions of the
time of the year at several latitudes. Given that Philadelphia is located at approximately
latitude, ﬁnd a function that models the length of daylight at Philadelphia.
SOLUTION Notice that each curve resembles a shifted and stretched sine function. By look-
ing at the blue curve we see that, at the latitude of Philadelphia, daylight lasts about
14.8 hours on June 21 and 9.2 hours on December 21, so the amplitude of the curve (the
factor by which we have to stretch the sine curve vertically) is 
.
By what factor do we need to stretch the sine curve horizontally if we measure the
time t in days? Because there are about 365 days in a year, the period of our model
should be 365. But the period of 
is 
, so the horizontal stretching factor is
.
We also notice that the curve begins its cycle on March 21, the 80th day of the year,
so we have to shift the curve 80 units to the right. In addition, we shift it 12 units
upward. Therefore we model the length of daylight in Philadelphia on the tth day of the
year by the function
M
Another transformation of some interest is taking the absolute value of a function. If
, then according to the deﬁnition of absolute value, 
when 
and
when 
. This tells us how to get the graph of 
from the graph
of 
: The part of the graph that lies above the -axis remains the same; the part that
lies below the -axis is reﬂected about the -axis.

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst graph the parabola 
in Figure 10(a) by shifting the parabola
downward 1 unit. We see that the graph lies below the x-axis when 
,
so we reﬂect that part of the graph about the x-axis to obtain the graph of 
in Figure 10(b).

COMBINATIONS OF FUNCTIONS
Two functions 
and can be combined to form new functions 
, 
, 
, and 
in
a manner similar to the way we add, subtract, multiply, and divide real numbers. The sum
and difference functions are deﬁned by
If the domain of 
is A and the domain of is B, then the domain of 
is the intersec-
tion 
because both 
and 
have to be deﬁned. For example, the domain of
is 
and the domain of 
is 
, so the domain
of 
is 
.
Similarly, the product and quotient functions are deﬁned by
The domain of 
is 
, but we can’t divide by 0 and so the domain of 
is
. For instance, if 
and 
, then the domain of
the rational function 
is 
, or 
.
There is another way of combining two functions to obtain a new function. For 
example, suppose that 
and 
. Since y is a function of u
and u is, in turn, a function of x, it follows that is ultimately a function of x. We compute
this by substitution:
The procedure is called composition because the new function is composed of the two
given functions 
and .
In general, given any two functions 
and , we start with a number x in the domain of
and ﬁnd its image 
. If this number 
is in the domain of , then we can calculate
the value of 
. The result is a new function 
obtained by substituting
into . It is called the composition (or composite) of 
and 
and is denoted by 
(“f circle t”).
DEFINITION Given two functions 
and , the composite function
(also called
the composition of 
and ) is deﬁned by
The domain of 
is the set of all in the domain of such that 
is in the domain
of . In other words, 
is deﬁned whenever both 
and 
are deﬁned. Fig-
ure 11 shows how to picture

CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
GRAPHING CALCULATORS AND COMPUTERS
In this section we assume that you have access to a graphing calculator or a computer with
graphing software. We will see that the use of such a device enables us to graph more com-
plicated functions and to solve more complex problems than would otherwise be possible.
We also point out some of the pitfalls that can occur with these machines.
Graphing calculators and computers can give very accurate graphs of functions. But we
will see in Chapter 4 that only through the use of calculus can we be sure that we have
uncovered all the interesting aspects of a graph.
A graphing calculator or computer displays a rectangular portion of the graph of a func-
tion in a display window or viewing screen, which we refer to as a viewing rectangle.
The default screen often gives an incomplete or misleading picture, so it is important to
choose the viewing rectangle with care. If we choose the -values to range from a mini-
mum value of 
to a maximum value of 
and the -values to range from
a minimum of 
to a maximum of 
, then the visible portion of the graph
lies in the rectangle
shown in Figure 1. We refer to this rectangle as the
by 
viewing rectangle.
The machine draws the graph of a function 
much as you would. It plots points of the
form 
for a certain number of equally spaced values of 
between 
and . If an 
-value is not in the domain of , or if 
lies outside the viewing rectangle, it moves on
to the next -value. The machine connects each point to the preceding plotted point to form
a representation of the graph of .
EXAMPLE 1 Draw the graph of the function 
in each of the following
viewing rectangles.
(a)
by 
(b)
by 
(c)
by 
(d)
by 
SOLUTION For part (a) we select the range by setting min
,
max
, min
and max
. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 2(a). The display window is
blank! A moment’s thought provides the explanation: Notice that 
for all , so
for all . Thus the range of the function 
is 
. This 
means that the graph of 
lies entirely outside the viewing rectangle 
by 
.
The graphs for the viewing rectangles in parts (b), (c), and (d) are also shown in 
Figure 2. Observe that we get a more complete picture in parts (c) and (d), but in part (d)
it is not clear that the -intercept is 3.

We see from Example 1 that the choice of a viewing rectangle can make a big differ-
ence in the appearance of a graph. Often it’s necessary to change to a larger viewing 
rectangle to obtain a more complete picture, a more global view, of the graph. In the next
example we see that knowledge of the domain and range of a function sometimes provides
us with enough information to select a good viewing rectangle.
EXAMPLE 2 Determine an appropriate viewing rectangle for the function
and use it to graph .
SOLUTION The expression for 
is deﬁned when
Therefore the domain of 
is the interval 
. Also,
so the range of 
is the interval 
.
We choose the viewing rectangle so that the -interval is somewhat larger than the
domain and the -interval is larger than the range. Taking the viewing rectangle to be
by 
, we get the graph shown in Figure 3.
M
EXAMPLE 3 Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Here the domain is , the set of all real numbers. That doesn’t help us choose a
viewing rectangle. Let’s experiment. If we start with the viewing rectangle 
by
, we get the graph in Figure 4. It appears blank, but actually the graph is so
nearly vertical that it blends in with the -axis.
If we change the viewing rectangle to 
by 
, we get the picture
shown in Figure 5(a). The graph appears to consist of vertical lines, but we know that
can’t be correct. If we look carefully while the graph is being drawn, we see that the
graph leaves the screen and reappears during the graphing process. This indicates that 
we need to see more in the vertical direction, so we change the viewing rectangle to
by 
. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 5(b). It still doesn’t
quite reveal all the main features of the function, so we try 
by 
in Figure 5(c). Now we are more conﬁdent that we have arrived at an appropriate view-
ing rectangle. In Chapter 4 we will be able to see that the graph shown in Figure 5(c)
does indeed reveal all the main features of the function.

EXAMPLE 4 Graph the function 
in an appropriate viewing rectangle.
SOLUTION Figure 6(a) shows the graph of 
produced by a graphing calculator using the
viewing rectangle 
by 
. At ﬁrst glance the graph appears to be rea-
sonable. But if we change the viewing rectangle to the ones shown in the following parts
of Figure 6, the graphs look very different. Something strange is happening.
In order to explain the big differences in appearance of these graphs and to ﬁnd an
appropriate viewing rectangle, we need to ﬁnd the period of the function 
We know that the function 
has period 
and the graph of 
is 
compressed horizontally by a factor of 50, so the period of 
is
This suggests that we should deal only with small values of in order to show just a few
oscillations of the graph. If we choose the viewing rectangle 
by 
,
we get the graph shown in Figure 7.
Now we see what went wrong in Figure 6. The oscillations of
are so rapid
that when the calculator plots points and joins them, it misses most of the maximum and
minimum points and therefore gives a very misleading impression of the graph.
M
We have seen that the use of an inappropriate viewing rectangle can give a misleading
impression of the graph of a function. In Examples 1 and 3 we solved the problem by
changing to a larger viewing rectangle. In Example 4 we had to make the viewing rect-
angle smaller. In the next example we look at a function for which there is no single view-
ing rectangle that reveals the true shape of the graph.
EXAMPLE 5 Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Figure 8 shows the graph of 
produced by a graphing calculator with viewing
rectangle 
by 
. It looks much like the graph of 
, but per-
haps with some bumps attached. If we zoom in to the viewing rectangle 
by
, we can see much more clearly the shape of these bumps in Figure 9. The

CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
N The appearance of the graphs in Figure 6
depends on the machine used. The graphs you
get with your own graphing device might not
look like these ﬁgures, but they will also be quite
inaccurate.

reason for this behavior is that the second term, 
, is very small in comparison
with the ﬁrst term, 
. Thus we really need two graphs to see the true nature of this
function.
M
EXAMPLE 6 Draw the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION Figure 10(a) shows the graph produced by a graphing calculator with view-
ing rectangle 
by 
. In connecting successive points on the graph, the 
calculator produced a steep line segment from the top to the bottom of the screen. That
line segment is not truly part of the graph. Notice that the domain of the function
is 
. We can eliminate the extraneous near-vertical line by exper-
imenting with a change of scale. When we change to the smaller viewing rectangle
by 
on this particular calculator, we obtain the much better graph
in Figure 10(b).
M
EXAMPLE 7 Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Some graphing devices display the graph shown in Figure 11, whereas others
produce a graph like that in Figure 12. We know from Section 1.2 (Figure 13) that the
graph in Figure 12 is correct, so what happened in Figure 11? The explanation is that
some machines compute the cube root of using a logarithm, which is not deﬁned if 
is negative, so only the right half of the graph is produced.

N Another way to avoid the extraneous line is to
change the graphing mode on the calculator so
that the dots are not connected.

You should experiment with your own machine to see which of these two graphs is
produced. If you get the graph in Figure 11, you can obtain the correct picture by graph-
ing the function 
Notice that this function is equal to 
(except when 
).
M
To understand how the expression for a function relates to its graph, it’s helpful to graph
a family of functions, that is, a collection of functions whose equations are related. In the
next example we graph members of a family of cubic polynomials.
EXAMPLE 8 Graph the function 
for various values of the number . How
does the graph change when is changed?
SOLUTION Figure 13 shows the graphs of 
for 
, , ,
, and 
. We see
that, for positive values of , the graph increases from left to right with no maximum or
minimum points (peaks or valleys). When 
, the curve is ﬂat at the origin. When 
is negative, the curve has a maximum point and a minimum point. As decreases, the
maximum point becomes higher and the minimum point lower.
M
EXAMPLE 9 Find the solution of the equation 
correct to two decimal places.
SOLUTION The solutions of the equation 
are the -coordinates of the points of
intersection of the curves 
and 
. From Figure 14(a) we see that there is
only one solution and it lies between 0 and 1. Zooming in to the viewing rectangle 
by 
, we see from Figure 14(b) that the root lies between 0.7 and 0.8. So we zoom in
further to the viewing rectangle 
by 
in Figure 14(c). By moving the
cursor to the intersection point of the two curves, or by inspection and the fact that the 
-scale is 0.01, we see that the solution of the equation is about 0.74. (Many calculators
have a built-in intersection feature.)

EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
The function 
is called an exponential function because the variable, x, is the
exponent. It should not be confused with the power function 
, in which the vari-
able is the base.
In general, an exponential function is a function of the form
where is a positive constant. Let’s recall what this means.
If 
, a positive integer, then
n factors
If 
, and if 
, where is a positive integer, then
If is a rational number,
, where 
and are integers and 
, then
But what is the meaning of 
if x is an irrational number? For instance, what is meant by
or 
?
To help us answer this question we ﬁrst look at the graph of the function 
, where
x is rational. A representation of this graph is shown in Figure 1. We want to enlarge the
domain of 
to include both rational and irrational numbers.
There are holes in the graph in Figure 1 corresponding to irrational values of x. We want
to ﬁll in the holes by deﬁning 
, where 
, so that 
is an increasing function.
In particular, since the irrational number

It can be shown that there is exactly one number that is greater than all of the numbers

and less than all of the numbers

We deﬁne 
to be this number. Using the preceding approximation process we can com-
pute it correct to six decimal places:
Similarly, we can deﬁne 
(or 
, if 
) where x is any irrational number. Figure 2
shows how all the holes in Figure 1 have been ﬁlled to complete the graph of the function
.
The graphs of members of the family of functions 
are shown in Figure 3 for var-
ious values of the base a. Notice that all of these graphs pass through the same point 
because 
for 
. Notice also that as the base a gets larger, the exponential func-
tion grows more rapidly (for 
).
You can see from Figure 3 that there are basically three kinds of exponential functions
. If 
, the exponential function decreases; if 
, it is a constant; and if
, it increases. These three cases are illustrated in Figure 4. Observe that if

One reason for the importance of the exponential function lies in the following proper-
ties. If x and y are rational numbers, then these laws are well known from elementary 
algebra. It can be proved that they remain true for arbitrary real numbers x and y. (See

APPLICATIONS OF EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
The exponential function occurs very frequently in mathematical models of nature and
society. Here we indicate brieﬂy how it arises in the description of population growth. 
In Chapter 3 we will pursue these and other applications in greater detail.
First we consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient medium. Suppose
that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined that the population
doubles every hour. If the number of bacteria at time t is 
, where t is measured in hours,
and the initial population is 
, then we have
It seems from this pattern that, in general,
This population function is a constant multiple of the exponential function 
, so it
exhibits the rapid growth that we observed in Figures 2 and 7. Under ideal conditions
(unlimited space and nutrition and freedom from disease) this exponential growth is typi-
cal of what actually occurs in nature.
What about the human population? Table 1 shows data for the population of the world
in the 20th century and Figure 8 shows the corresponding scatter plot.

N Example 2 shows that 
increases more
quickly than 
. To demonstrate just how
quickly 
increases, let’s perform the
following thought experiment. Suppose we start
with a piece of paper a thousandth of an inch
thick and we fold it in half 50 times. Each time
we fold the paper in half, the thickness of the
paper doubles, so the thickness of the resulting
paper would be 
inches. How thick do 
you think that is? It works out to be more than
17 million miles!

The pattern of the data points in Figure 8 suggests exponential growth, so we use a
graphing calculator with exponential regression capability to apply the method of least
squares and obtain the exponential model
Figure 9 shows the graph of this exponential function together with the original data
points. We see that the exponential curve ﬁts the data reasonably well. The period of rela-
tively slow population growth is explained by the two world wars and the Great Depres-
sion of the 1930s.
THE NUMBER e
Of all possible bases for an exponential function, there is one that is most convenient for
the purposes of calculus. The choice of a base a is inﬂuenced by the way the graph of
crosses the y-axis. Figures 10 and 11 show the tangent lines to the graphs of 
and 
at the point 
. (Tangent lines will be deﬁned precisely in Section 2.7. For
present purposes, you can think of the tangent line to an exponential graph at a point as the
line that touches the graph only at that point.) If we measure the slopes of these tangent
lines at 
, we ﬁnd that 
for 
and 
for 
.
It turns out, as we will see in Chapter 3, that some of the formulas of calculus will be
greatly simpliﬁed if we choose the base a so that the slope of the tangent line to 
at
is exactly 1. (See Figure 12.) In fact, there is such a number and it is denoted by the
letter e. (This notation was chosen by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1727,
probably because it is the ﬁrst letter of the word exponential.) In view of Figures 10 and
11, it comes as no surprise that the number e lies between 2 and 3 and the graph of 
lies between the graphs of 
and 
. (See Figure 13.) In Chapter 3 we will see
that the value of e, correct to ﬁve decimal places, is

SOLUTION We start with the graph of 
from Figures 12 and 14(a) and reﬂect about
the y-axis to get the graph of 
in Figure 14(b). (Notice that the graph crosses the
y-axis with a slope of !1). Then we compress the graph vertically by a factor of 2 to
obtain the graph of 
in Figure 14(c). Finally, we shift the graph downward one
unit to get the desired graph in Figure 14(d). The domain is ! and the range is

Suppose, however, that the biologist changes her point of view and becomes interested
in the time required for the population to reach various levels. In other words, she is think-
ing of t as a function of N. This function is called the inverse function of f, denoted by

CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
Not all functions possess inverses. Let’s compare the functions 
and 
whose arrow
diagrams are shown in Figure 1. Note that 
never takes on the same value twice (any two
inputs in 
have different outputs), whereas 
does take on the same value twice (both 2
and 3 have the same output, 4). In symbols,
but
Functions that share this property with 
are called one-to-one functions.
DEFINITION A function 
is called a one-to-one function if it never takes on
the same value twice; that is,
If a horizontal line intersects the graph of 
in more than one point, then we see from
Figure 2 that there are numbers 
and 
such that 
. This means that 
is not
one-to-one. Therefore we have the following geometric method for determining whether a
function is one-to-one.
HORIZONTAL LINE TEST
A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line
intersects its graph more than once.
EXAMPLE 1 Is the function 
one-to-one?
SOLUTION 1 If 
, then 
(two different numbers can’t have the same cube).
Therefore, by Deﬁnition 1,
is one-to-one.
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 3 we see that no horizontal line intersects the graph of 
more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test,
is one-to-one.

EXAMPLE 2 Is the function

SOLUTION 1 This function is not one-to-one because, for instance,

M
One-to-one functions are important because they are precisely the functions that pos-
sess inverse functions according to the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION Let 
be a one-to-one function with domain 
and range . Then
its inverse function
has domain 
and range 
and is deﬁned by
for any in .
This deﬁnition says that if 
maps into , then 
maps back into . (If 
were not
one-to-one, then 
would not be uniquely deﬁned.) The arrow diagram in Figure 5 indi-
cates that 
reverses the effect of . Note that
For example, the inverse function of

The diagram in Figure 6 makes it clear how

M
The letter 
is traditionally used as the independent variable, so when we concentrate
on 
rather than on , we usually reverse the roles of 
and 
in Deﬁnition 2 and write
By substituting for in Deﬁnition 2 and substituting for in (3), we get the following
cancellation equations:
The ﬁrst cancellation equation says that if we start with , apply , and then apply 
we
arrive back at , where we started (see the machine diagram in Figure 7). Thus 
undoes
what 
does. The second equation says that 
undoes what 
does.
For example, if 
, then 
and so the cancellation equations become
These equations simply say that the cube function and the cube root function cancel each
other when applied in succession.
Now let’s see how to compute inverse functions. If we have a function 
and are
able to solve this equation for in terms of , then according to Deﬁnition 2 we must have
. If we want to call the independent variable x, we then interchange and and
arrive at the equation

The principle of interchanging 
and 
to ﬁnd the inverse function also gives us the
method for obtaining the graph of 
from the graph of . Since 
if and only if
, the point 
is on the graph of 
if and only if the point 
is on the
graph of 
. But we get the point 
from 
by reﬂecting about the line 
. (See
Figure 8.)
Therefore, as illustrated by Figure 9:
The graph of 
is obtained by reﬂecting the graph of 
about the line 
.
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graphs of 
and its inverse function using the
same coordinate axes.
SOLUTION First we sketch the curve 
(the top half of the parabola
, or 
) and then we reﬂect about the line 
to get the 
graph of 
. (See Figure 10.) As a check on our graph, notice that the expression for
is 
. So the graph of 
is the right half of the parabola
and this seems reasonable from Figure 10.

LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS

NATURAL LOGARITHMS

choice of a base is the number , which was deﬁned in Section 1.5. The logarithm with

N NOTATION FOR LOGARITHMS
Most textbooks in calculus and the sciences, as
well as calculators, use the notation 
for the
natural logarithm and 
for the “common
logarithm,” 
. In the more advanced mathe-
matical and scientiﬁc literature and in computer
languages, however, the notation 
usually
denotes the natural logarithm.
log x
log10 x
log x
ln x

If we put 
and replace 
with “ln” in (6) and (7), then the deﬁning properties
of the natural logarithm function become
In particular, if we set 
, we get
EXAMPLE 7 Find if 
.
SOLUTION 1 From (8) we see that
Therefore 
.
(If you have trouble working with the “ln” notation, just replace it by 
. Then the
equation becomes 
; so, by the deﬁnition of logarithm,
.)
SOLUTION 2 Start with the equation
and apply the exponential function to both sides of the equation:
But the second cancellation equation in (9) says that 
. Therefore,
.
M
EXAMPLE 8 Solve the equation 
.
SOLUTION We take natural logarithms of both sides of the equation and use (9):
Since the natural logarithm is found on scientiﬁc calculators, we can approximate the
solution: to four decimal places,

The following formula shows that logarithms with any base can be expressed in terms
of the natural logarithm.

, we have
PROOF
Let 
. Then, from (6), we have 
. Taking natural logarithms of both
sides of this equation, we get 
. Therefore
M
Scientiﬁc calculators have a key for natural logarithms, so Formula 10 enables us to use
a calculator to compute a logarithm with any base (as shown in the following example).
Similarly, Formula 10 allows us to graph any logarithmic function on a graphing calcula-
tor or computer (see Exercises 41 and 42).
EXAMPLE 10 Evaluate 
correct to six decimal places.
SOLUTION Formula 10 gives
M
The graphs of the exponential function 
and its inverse function, the natural log-
arithm function, are shown in Figure 13. Because the curve 
crosses the y-axis with
a slope of 1, it follows that the reﬂected curve 
crosses the x-axis with a slope of 1.
In common with all other logarithmic functions with base greater than 1, the natural
logarithm is an increasing function deﬁned on 
and the y-axis is a vertical asymptote.
(This means that the values of 
become very large negative as approaches 0.)
EXAMPLE 11 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION We start with the graph of 
as given in Figure 13. Using the transforma-
tions of Section 1.3, we shift it 2 units to the right to get the graph of

then we shift it 1 unit downward to get the graph of

Although 
is an increasing function, it grows very slowly when 
. In fact,
grows more slowly than any positive power of . To illustrate this fact, we compare
approximate values of the functions 
and 
in the following table
and we graph them in Figures 15 and 16. You can see that initially the graphs of 
and 
grow at comparable rates, but eventually the root function far surpasses the
logarithm.
INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
When we try to ﬁnd the inverse trigonometric functions, we have a slight difﬁculty:
Because the trigonometric functions are not one-to-one, they don’t have inverse functions.
The difﬁculty is overcome by restricting the domains of these functions so that they
become one-to-one.
You can see from Figure 17 that the sine function 
is not one-to-one (use the
Horizontal Line Test). But the function 
, is one-to-one
(see Figure 18). The inverse function of this restricted sine function 
exists and is denot-
ed by 
or 
. It is called the inverse sine function or the arcsine function.

There are no hard and fast rules that will ensure success in solving problems. However, it is
possible to outline some general steps in the problem-solving process and to give some prin-
ciples that may be useful in the solution of certain problems. These steps and principles are
just common sense made explicit. They have been adapted from George Polya’s book How
To Solve It.
The ﬁrst step is to read the problem and make sure that you understand it clearly. Ask your-
self the following questions:
For many problems it is useful to
draw a diagram
and identify the given and required quantities on the diagram.
Usually it is necessary to
introduce suitable notation
In choosing symbols for the unknown quantities we often use letters such as a, b, c, m, n, x,
and y, but in some cases it helps to use initials as suggestive symbols; for instance, 
for
volume or for time.
Think of a Plan
Find a connection between the given information and the unknown that will enable you to
calculate the unknown. It often helps to ask yourself explicitly: “How can I relate the given
to the unknown?” If you don’t see a connection immediately, the following ideas may be
helpful in devising a plan.
Try to Recognize Something Familiar
Relate the given situation to previous knowledge. Look
at the unknown and try to recall a more familiar problem that has a similar unknown.
Try to Recognize Patterns
Some problems are solved by recognizing that some kind of pat-
tern is occurring. The pattern could be geometric, or numerical, or algebraic. If you can see
regularity or repetition in a problem, you might be able to guess what the continuing pattern
is and then prove it.
Use Analogy
Try to think of an analogous problem, that is, a similar problem, a related
problem, but one that is easier than the original problem. If you can solve the similar, sim-
pler problem, then it might give you the clues you need to solve the original, more difﬁcult
problem. For instance, if a problem involves very large numbers, you could ﬁrst try a simi-
lar problem with smaller numbers. Or if the problem involves three-dimensional geometry,
you could look for a similar problem in two-dimensional geometry. Or if the problem you
start with is a general one, you could ﬁrst try a special case.
Introduce Something Extra
It may sometimes be necessary to introduce something new, an
auxiliary aid, to help make the connection between the given and the unknown. For instance,
in a problem where a diagram is useful the auxiliary aid could be a new line drawn in a dia-
gram. In a more algebraic problem it could be a new unknown that is related to the original
unknown.

P R O B L E M  S O L V I N G
P R I N C I P L E S  O F
P R O B L E M  S O L V I N G

77
Take Cases
We may sometimes have to split a problem into several cases and give a dif-
ferent argument for each of the cases. For instance, we often have to use this strategy in deal-
ing with absolute value.
Work Backward
Sometimes it is useful to imagine that your problem is solved and work
backward, step by step, until you arrive at the given data. Then you may be able to reverse
your steps and thereby construct a solution to the original problem. This procedure is com-
monly used in solving equations. For instance, in solving the equation 
, we sup-
pose that is a number that satisﬁes 
and work backward. We add 5 to each side
of the equation and then divide each side by 3 to get 
. Since each of these steps can
be reversed, we have solved the problem.
Establish Subgoals
In a complex problem it is often useful to set subgoals (in which the
desired situation is only partially fulﬁlled). If we can ﬁrst reach these subgoals, then we may
be able to build on them to reach our ﬁnal goal.
Indirect Reasoning
Sometimes it is appropriate to attack a problem indirectly. In using
proof by contradiction to prove that 
implies , we assume that 
is true and 
is false and
try to see why this can’t happen. Somehow we have to use this information and arrive at a
contradiction to what we absolutely know is true.
Mathematical Induction
In proving statements that involve a positive integer , it is fre-
quently helpful to use the following principle.
PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION Let 
be a statement about the positive 
integer . Suppose that
1.
is true.
2.
is true whenever 
is true.
Then 
is true for all positive integers .
This is reasonable because, since 
is true, it follows from condition 2 (with 
) that 
is true. Then, using condition 2 with 
, we see that 
is true. Again using
condition 2, this time with 
, we have that 
is true. This procedure can be followed
indeﬁnitely.
Carry Out the Plan
In Step 2 a plan was devised. In carrying out that plan we have to check each stage of the
plan and write the details that prove that each stage is correct.
Look Back
Having completed our solution, it is wise to look back over it, partly to see if we have made
errors in the solution and partly to see if we can think of an easier way to solve the problem.
Another reason for looking back is that it will familiarize us with the method of solution and
this may be useful for solving a future problem. Descartes said, “Every problem that I solved
became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems.”
These principles of problem solving are illustrated in the following examples. Before you
look at the solutions, try to solve these problems yourself, referring to these Principles of
Problem Solving if you get stuck. You may ﬁnd it useful to refer to this section from time
to time as you solve the exercises in the remaining chapters of this book.

EXAMPLE 1 Express the hypotenuse of a right triangle with area 
as a function of
its perimeter P.
SOLUTION Let’s ﬁrst sort out the information by identifying the unknown quantity and the data:
It helps to draw a diagram and we do so in Figure 1.
In order to connect the given quantities to the unknown, we introduce two extra vari-
ables 
and , which are the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. This enables us
to express the given condition, which is that the triangle is right-angled, by the Pythago-
rean Theorem:
The other connections among the variables come by writing expressions for the area and
perimeter:
Since 
is given, notice that we now have three equations in the three unknowns , , 
and :
Although we have the correct number of equations, they are not easy to solve in a straight-
forward fashion. But if we use the problem-solving strategy of trying to recognize some-
thing familiar, then we can solve these equations by an easier method. Look at the right
sides of Equations 1, 2, and 3. Do these expressions remind you of anything familiar?
Notice that they contain the ingredients of a familiar formula:
Using this idea, we express 
in two ways. From Equations 1 and 2 we have
From Equation 3 we have
Thus
This is the required expression for h as a function of P.

As the next example illustrates, it is often necessary to use the problem-solving prin-
ciple of taking cases when dealing with absolute values.
EXAMPLE 2 Solve the inequality 
.
SOLUTION Recall the deﬁnition of absolute value:
It follows that
Similarly
These expressions show that we must consider three cases:
CASE I If 
, we have
CASE II If 
the given inequality becomes
(always true)
CASE III If 
, the inequality becomes
Combining cases I, II, and III, we see that the inequality is satisﬁed when

So the solution is the interval

In A Preview of Calculus (page 2) we saw how the idea of a limit underlies the various
branches of calculus. It is therefore appropriate to begin our study of calculus by
investigating limits and their properties. The special type of limit that is used to ﬁnd
tangents and velocities gives rise to the central idea in differential calculus, the
derivative.
The idea of a limit is 
illustrated by secant lines 
approaching a tangent line.
LIMITS AND 
DERIVATIVES

THE TANGENT AND VELOCITY PROBLEMS
In this section we see how limits arise when we attempt to ﬁnd the tangent to a curve or
the velocity of an object.
THE TANGENT PROBLEM
The word tangent is derived from the Latin word tangens, which means “touching.” Thus
a tangent to a curve is a line that touches the curve. In other words, a tangent line should
have the same direction as the curve at the point of contact. How can this idea be made
precise?
For a circle we could simply follow Euclid and say that a tangent is a line that intersects
the circle once and only once as in Figure 1(a). For more complicated curves this deﬁni-
tion is inadequate. Figure l(b) shows two lines and passing through a point 
on a curve
. The line intersects 
only once, but it certainly does not look like what we think of as
a tangent. The line , on the other hand, looks like a tangent but it intersects 
twice.
To be speciﬁc, let’s look at the problem of trying to ﬁnd a tangent line to the parabola
in the following example.
EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola 
at the 
point 
.
SOLUTION We will be able to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line as soon as we know its
slope . The difﬁculty is that we know only one point,
, on , whereas we need two
points to compute the slope. But observe that we can compute an approximation to 
by
choosing a nearby point 
on the parabola (as in Figure 2) and computing the
slope 
of the secant line 
.
We choose 
so that 
. Then
For instance, for the point 
we have
The tables in the margin show the values of 
for several values of close to 1. The
closer 
is to , the closer is to 1 and, it appears from the tables, the closer 
is to 2.
This suggests that the slope of the tangent line should be 
.
We say that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slopes of the secant lines,
and we express this symbolically by writing
and
Assuming that the slope of the tangent line is indeed 2, we use the point-slope form
of the equation of a line (see Appendix B) to write the equation of the tangent line
through 
as

Figure 3 illustrates the limiting process that occurs in this example. As 
approaches
along the parabola, the corresponding secant lines rotate about 
and approach the
tangent line t.

Many functions that occur in science are not described by explicit equations; they are
deﬁned by experimental data. The next example shows how to estimate the slope of the
tangent line to the graph of such a function.
EXAMPLE 2 The ﬂash unit on a camera operates by storing charge on a capacitor 
and releasing it suddenly when the ﬂash is set off. The data in the table describe the
charge Q remaining on the capacitor (measured in microcoulombs) at time t (measured
in seconds after the ﬂash goes off). Use the data to draw the graph of this function and
estimate the slope of the tangent line at the point where t ! 0.04. [Note: The slope of
the tangent line represents the electric current ﬂowing from the capacitor to the ﬂash
bulb (measured in microamperes).]
SOLUTION In Figure 4 we plot the given data and use them to sketch a curve that approxi-
mates the graph of the function.

Given the points

slope of the secant line PR is
The table at the left shows the results of similar calculations for the slopes of other
secant lines. From this table we would expect the slope of the tangent line at 
to
lie somewhere between !742 and !607.5. In fact, the average of the slopes of the two
closest secant lines is
So, by this method, we estimate the slope of the tangent line to be !675.
Another method is to draw an approximation to the tangent line at P and measure the
sides of the triangle ABC, as in Figure 4. This gives an estimate of the slope of the tan-
gent line as
M
THE VELOCITY PROBLEM
If you watch the speedometer of a car as you travel in city trafﬁc, you see that the needle
doesn’t stay still for very long; that is, the velocity of the car is not constant. We assume
from watching the speedometer that the car has a deﬁnite velocity at each moment, but how
is the “instantaneous” velocity deﬁned? Let’s investigate the example of a falling ball.
EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN
Tower in Toronto, 450 m above the ground. Find the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds.
SOLUTION Through experiments carried out four centuries ago, Galileo discovered that the
distance fallen by any freely falling body is proportional to the square of the time it has
been falling. (This model for free fall neglects air resistance.) If the distance fallen after 
seconds is denoted by 
and measured in meters, then Galileo’s law is expressed by
the equation
The difﬁculty in ﬁnding the velocity after 5 s is that we are dealing with a single
instant of time 
, so no time interval is involved. However, we can approximate the
desired quantity by computing the average velocity over the brief time interval of a tenth
of a second from 
to

The following table shows the results of similar calculations of the average velocity over
successively smaller time periods.
It appears that as we shorten the time period, the average velocity is becoming closer to
49 m#s. The instantaneous velocity when 
is deﬁned to be the limiting value of
these average velocities over shorter and shorter time periods that start at 
. Thus 
the (instantaneous) velocity after 5 s is
M
You may have the feeling that the calculations used in solving this problem are very sim-
ilar to those used earlier in this section to ﬁnd tangents. In fact, there is a close connec-
tion between the tangent problem and the problem of ﬁnding velocities. If we draw the
graph of the distance function of the ball (as in Figure 5) and we consider the points
and 
on the graph, then the slope of the secant line 
is
which is the same as the average velocity over the time interval 
. Therefore, the
velocity at time 
(the limit of these average velocities as 
approaches 0) must be
equal to the slope of the tangent line at 
(the limit of the slopes of the secant lines).
Examples 1 and 3 show that in order to solve tangent and velocity problems we must
be able to ﬁnd limits. After studying methods for computing limits in the next ﬁve sections,
we will return to the problems of ﬁnding tangents and velocities in Section 2.7.

CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION
Having seen in the preceding section how limits arise when we want to ﬁnd the tangent to
a curve or the velocity of an object, we now turn our attention to limits in general and
numerical and graphical methods for computing them.
Let’s investigate the behavior of the function 
deﬁned by 
for val-
ues of near 2. The following table gives values of 
for values of close to 2, but not
equal to 2.
From the table and the graph of 
(a parabola) shown in Figure 1 we see that when is
close to 2 (on either side of 2),
is close to 4. In fact, it appears that we can make the
values of 
as close as we like to 4 by taking 
sufﬁciently close to 2. We express this
by saying “the limit of the function 
as 
approaches 2 is equal to 4.”
The notation for this is
In general, we use the following notation.
DEFINITION We write
and say
“the limit of 
, as approaches , equals ”
if we can make the values of 
arbitrarily close to 
(as close to L as we like)
by taking x to be sufﬁciently close to (on either side of ) but not equal to .
Roughly speaking, this says that the values of 
tend to get closer and closer to the
number 
as 
gets closer and closer to the number 
(from either side of ) but 
. 
(A more precise deﬁnition will be given in Section 2.4.)
An alternative notation for
is
as
which is usually read “
approaches 
as approaches .”

SOLUTION Notice that the function 
is not deﬁned when 
, but
that doesn’t matter because the deﬁnition of 
says that we consider values of

The tables at the left give values of 
(correct to six decimal places) for values of 
that approach 1 (but are not equal to 1). On the basis of the values in the tables, we make
the guess that

Example 1 is illustrated by the graph of

slightly by
giving it the value 2 when 
and calling the resulting function :
This new function still has the same limit as approaches 1 (see Figure 4).

In Example 2 what would have happened if we had taken even smaller values of 
The
table in the margin shows the results from one calculator; you can see that something
strange seems to be happening.
If you try these calculations on your own calculator you might get different values, but
eventually you will get the value 0 if you make sufﬁciently small. Does this mean that
the answer is really 0 instead of ? No, the value of the limit is , as we will show in the

close to 3 when is small. (In fact, when t is sufﬁciently small, a calculator’s value for

to as many digits as the calculator is capable of carrying.)
Something similar happens when we try to graph the function
of Example 2 on a graphing calculator or computer. Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 5 show quite
accurate graphs of , and when we use the trace mode (if available) we can estimate eas-
ily that the limit is about . But if we zoom in too much, as in parts (c) and (d), then we get
inaccurate graphs, again because of problems with subtraction.

N COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS
Computer algebra systems (CAS) have
commands that compute limits. In order to
avoid the types of pitfalls demonstrated in
Examples 2, 4, and 5, they don’t ﬁnd limits by
numerical experimentation. Instead, they use
more sophisticated techniques such as com-
puting inﬁnite series. If you have access to a
CAS, use the limit command to compute the
limits in the examples of this section and to
check your answers in the exercises of this
chapter.

The dashed lines near the -axis indicate that the values of 
oscillate between
1 and 
inﬁnitely often as approaches 0. (See Exercise 39.) 
Since the values of 
do not approach a ﬁxed number as approaches 0,
M
EXAMPLE 5 Find 
.
SOLUTION As before, we construct a table of values. From the ﬁrst table in the margin it
appears that
But if we persevere with smaller values of , the second table suggests that
Later we will see that 
; then it follows that the limit is 0.0001.

|
Examples 4 and 5 illustrate some of the pitfalls in guessing the value of a limit. It is
easy to guess the wrong value if we use inappropriate values of , but it is difﬁcult to know
when to stop calculating values. And, as the discussion after Example 2 shows, sometimes
calculators and computers give the wrong values. In the next section, however, we will
develop foolproof methods for calculating limits.
EXAMPLE 6 The Heaviside function 
is deﬁned by
[This function is named after the electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925) and
can be used to describe an electric current that is switched on at time 
.] Its graph is
shown in Figure 8.
As approaches 0 from the left, 
approaches 0. As approaches 0 from the right,
approaches 1. There is no single number that 
approaches as
approaches 0.
Therefore, 
does not exist.
M
ONE-SIDED LIMITS

approaches 0 as approaches 0 from the left and 
approaches 1 as approaches 0 from the right. We indicate this situation symbolically by
writing
and
The symbol “

wise, “

DEFINITION We write

as 
approaches 
from the left] is equal to 
if we can make the values of 
arbi-
trarily close to L by taking x to be sufﬁciently close to a and x less than a.
Notice that Deﬁnition 2 differs from Deﬁnition 1 only in that we require 
to be less
than . Similarly, if we require that 
be greater than , we get “the right-hand limit of
as
approaches 
is equal to ” and we write
Thus the symbol “
” means that we consider only

trated in Figure 9.
By comparing Deﬁnition l with the deﬁnitions of one-sided limits, we see that the fol-
lowing is true.

SOLUTION As becomes close to 0, 
also becomes close to 0, and 
becomes very
large. (See the table in the margin.) In fact, it appears from the graph of the function
shown in Figure 11 that the values of

taking close enough to 0. Thus the values of

M
To indicate the kind of behavior exhibited in Example 8, we use the notation
| This does not mean that we are regarding 
as a number. Nor does it mean that the limit
exists. It simply expresses the particular way in which the limit does not exist: 
can be
made as large as we like by taking close enough to 0.
In general, we write symbolically
to indicate that the values of 
tend to become larger and larger (or “increase without
bound”) as becomes closer and closer to .
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on both sides of , except possibly at
itself. Then
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily large (as large as we please)
by taking sufﬁciently close to , but not equal to a.
Another notation for 
is
as
Again the symbol 
is not a number, but the expression 
is often read as
“the limit of 
, as approaches , is inﬁnity”
or
“
becomes inﬁnite as approaches ”
or
“
increases without bound as approaches ”
This deﬁnition is illustrated graphically in Figure 12.

A similar sort of limit, for functions that become large negative as gets close to , is
deﬁned in Deﬁnition 5 and is illustrated in Figure 13.
DEFINITION Let 
be deﬁned on both sides of , except possibly at itself. Then
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily large negative by taking 
sufﬁciently close to , but not equal to a.
The symbol 
can be read as “the limit of 
, as 
approaches , 
is negative inﬁnity” or “
decreases without bound as approaches .” As an example
we have
Similar deﬁnitions can be given for the one-sided inﬁnite limits
remembering that “
” means that we consider only values of 
that are less than ,
and similarly “
” means that we consider only 
. Illustrations of these four
cases are given in Figure 14.
DEFINITION The line 
is called a vertical asymptote of the curve 
if at least one of the following statements is true:
For instance, the 
-axis is a vertical asymptote of the curve 
because
. In Figure 14 the line 
is a vertical asymptote in each of the four
cases shown. In general, knowledge of vertical asymptotes is very useful in sketching
graphs.

we mean that it is negative but its magnitude

EXAMPLE 9 Find

.
SOLUTION If is close to 3 but larger than 3, then the denominator 
is a small posi-
tive number and 
is close to 6. So the quotient 
is a large positive number.
Thus, intuitively, we see that
Likewise, if is close to 3 but smaller than 3, then 
is a small negative number but
is still a positive number (close to 6). So 
is a numerically large negative
number. Thus
The graph of the curve

cal asymptote.

SOLUTION Because
there are potential vertical asymptotes where

This shows that the line 
is a vertical asymptote. Similar reasoning shows 
that the lines

M
Another example of a function whose graph has a vertical asymptote is the natural log-
arithmic function 
. From Figure 17 we see that
and so the line 
(the y-axis) is a vertical asymptote. In fact, the same is true for

CALCULATING LIMITS USING THE LIMIT LAWS
In Section 2.2 we used calculators and graphs to guess the values of limits, but we saw that
such methods don’t always lead to the correct answer. In this section we use the following
properties of limits, called the Limit Laws, to calculate limits.

These ﬁve laws can be stated verbally as follows:
SUM LAW
1. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.
DIFFERENCE LAW
2. The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits.
CONSTANT MULTIPLE LAW
3. The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the 
function.
PRODUCT LAW
4. The limit of a product is the product of the limits.
QUOTIENT LAW
5. The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of the
denominator is not 0).
It is easy to believe that these properties are true. For instance, if 
is close to 
and
is close to 
, it is reasonable to conclude that 
is close to 
. This gives
us an intuitive basis for believing that Law 1 is true. In Section 2.4 we give a precise def-
inition of a limit and use it to prove this law. The proofs of the remaining laws are given
in Appendix F.
EXAMPLE 1 Use the Limit Laws and the graphs of 
and t in Figure 1 to evaluate the
following limits, if they exist.
(a)
(b)
(c)
SOLUTION
(a) From the graphs of 
and t we see that
Therefore, we have

(by Law 3)
(b) We see that 
. But 
does not exist because the left and
right limits are different:
So we can’t use Law 4 for the desired limit. But we can use Law 4 for the one-sided
limits:
The left and right limits aren’t equal, so 
does not exist.
(c) The graphs show that
Because the limit of the denominator is 0, we can’t use Law 5. The given limit does not
exist because the denominator approaches 0 while the numerator approaches a nonzero
number.

These limits are obvious from an intuitive point of view (state them in words or draw
graphs of 
and 
), but proofs based on the precise deﬁnition are requested in the
exercises for Section 2.4.
If we now put 
in Law 6 and use Law 8, we get another useful special limit.

A similar limit holds for roots as follows. (For square roots the proof is outlined in Exer-
cise 37 in Section 2.4.)

tor is not 0.

If we let 
, then 
. In other words, we would have
gotten the correct answer in Example 2(a) by substituting 5 for x. Similarly, direct substi-
tution provides the correct answer in part (b). The functions in Example 2 are a polynomial
and a rational function, respectively, and similar use of the Limit Laws proves that direct
substitution always works for such functions (see Exercises 53 and 54). We state this fact
as follows.
DIRECT SUBSTITUTION PROPERTY If 
is a polynomial or a rational function and 
is in the domain of , then
Functions with the Direct Substitution Property are called continuous at a and will be
studied in Section 2.5. However, not all limits can be evaluated by direct substitution, as
the following examples show.
EXAMPLE 3 Find 
.
SOLUTION Let 
. We can’t ﬁnd the limit by substituting 
because 
isn’t deﬁned. Nor can we apply the Quotient Law, because the limit of the
denominator is 0. Instead, we need to do some preliminary algebra. We factor the numer-
ator as a difference of squares:
The numerator and denominator have a common factor of 
. When we take the limit
as approaches 1, we have 
and so 
. Therefore we can cancel the com-
mon factor and compute the limit as follows:
The limit in this example arose in Section 2.1 when we were trying to ﬁnd the tangent to
the parabola 
at the point 
.

In Example 3 we were able to compute the limit by replacing the given function
by a simpler function, 
, with the same limit. This is

CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day in
1642, the year of Galileo’s death. When he
entered Cambridge University in 1661 Newton
didn’t know much mathematics, but he learned
quickly by reading Euclid and Descartes and 
by attending the lectures of Isaac Barrow. 
Cambridge was closed because of the plague in
1665 and 1666, and Newton returned home to
reﬂect on what he had learned. Those two years
were amazingly productive for at that time he
made four of his major discoveries: (1) his
representation of functions as sums of inﬁnite
series, including the binomial theorem; (2) his
work on differential and integral calculus; (3) his
laws of motion and law of universal gravitation;
and (4) his prism experiments on the nature of
light and color. Because of a fear of controversy
and criticism, he was reluctant to publish his dis-
coveries and it wasn’t until 1687, at the urging of
the astronomer Halley, that Newton published
Principia Mathematica. In this work, the greatest
scientiﬁc treatise ever written, Newton set forth
his version of calculus and used it to investigate
mechanics, ﬂuid dynamics, and wave motion,
and to explain the motion of planets and comets.
The beginnings of calculus are found in the
calculations of areas and volumes by ancient
Greek scholars such as Eudoxus and Archimedes.
Although aspects of the idea of a limit are
implicit in their “method of exhaustion,” Eudoxus
and Archimedes never explicitly formulated the
concept of a limit. Likewise, mathematicians
such as Cavalieri, Fermat, and Barrow, the imme-
diate precursors of Newton in the development
of calculus, did not actually use limits. It was
Isaac Newton who was the ﬁrst to talk explicitly
about limits. He explained that the main idea
behind limits is that quantities “approach nearer
than by any given difference.” Newton stated
that the limit was the basic concept in calculus,
but it was left to later mathematicians like
Cauchy to clarify his ideas about limits.

nator is 0. Here the preliminary algebra consists of rationalizing the numerator:

Some limits are best calculated by ﬁrst ﬁnding the left- and right-hand limits. The fol-
lowing theorem is a reminder of what we discovered in Section 2.2. It says that a two-sided
limit exists if and only if both of the one-sided limits exist and are equal.
THEOREM
if and only if
When computing one-sided limits, we use the fact that the Limit Laws also hold for
one-sided limits.

SECTION 2.4 THE PRECISE DEFINITION OF A LIMIT
||||
109
THE PRECISE DEFINITION OF A LIMIT
The intuitive deﬁnition of a limit given in Section 2.2 is inadequate for some purposes
because such phrases as “ is close to 2” and “
gets closer and closer to L” are vague.
In order to be able to prove conclusively that
we must make the deﬁnition of a limit precise.
To motivate the precise deﬁnition of a limit, let’s consider the function
Intuitively, it is clear that when 
is close to 3 but 
, then 
is close to 5, and so
.
To obtain more detailed information about how 
varies when is close to 3, we ask
the following question:
How close to 3 does 
have to be so that 
differs from 5 by less than 0.l?
The distance from to 3 is 
and the distance from 
to 5 is 
, so our
problem is to ﬁnd a number such that
If 
, then 
, so an equivalent formulation of our problem is to ﬁnd a num-
ber such that
Notice that if 
, then
that is,
Thus an answer to the problem is given by 
; that is, if 
is within a distance of
0.05 from 3, then 
will be within a distance of 0.1 from 5.
If we change the number 0.l in our problem to the smaller number 0.01, then by using
the same method we ﬁnd that 
will differ from 5 by less than 0.01 provided that dif-
fers from 3 by less than (0.01)#2 ! 0.005:
Similarly,
The numbers 
and 
that we have considered are error tolerances that we
might allow. For 5 to be the precise limit of 
as 
approaches 3, we must not only be
able to bring the difference between 
and 5 below each of these three numbers; we

N It is traditional to use the Greek letter

(

must be able to bring it below any positive number. And, by the same reasoning, we can!
If we write 
(the Greek letter epsilon) for an arbitrary positive number, then we ﬁnd as 
before that
This is a precise way of saying that 
is close to 5 when is close to 3 because (1) says
that we can make the values of 
within an arbitrary distance from 5 by taking the val-
ues of within a distance 
from 3 (but 
).
Note that (1) can be rewritten as follows:
then
and this is illustrated in Figure 1. By taking the values of 
(
) to lie in the interval
we can make the values of 
lie in the interval 
.
Using (1) as a model, we give a precise deﬁnition of a limit.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on some open interval that contains
the number , except possibly at itself. Then we say that the limit of 
as 
approaches 
is L, and we write
if for every number 
there is a number 
such that
then
Since
is the distance from
to
and
is the distance from
to
,
and since 
can be arbitrarily small, the deﬁnition of a limit can be expressed in words 
as follows:
means that the distance between 
and 
can be made arbitrarily small 
by taking the distance from to sufﬁciently small (but not 0).
Alternatively,
means that the values of 
can be made as close as we please to 
by taking close enough to (but not equal to ).
We can also reformulate Deﬁnition 2 in terms of intervals by observing that the in-
equality 
is equivalent to 
, which in turn can be written 
as 
. Also 
is true if and only if 
, that is, 
. Similarly, the inequality 
is equivalent to the pair of inequalities
. Therefore, in terms of intervals, Deﬁnition 2 can be stated 
as follows:
means that for every 
(no matter how small is) we can ﬁnd
such that if lies in the open interval

SECTION 2.4 THE PRECISE DEFINITION OF A LIMIT
||||
111
The deﬁnition of limit says that if any small interval
is given around
,
then we can ﬁnd an interval 
around 
such that 
maps all the points in
(except possibly ) into the interval 
. (See Figure 3.)
Another geometric interpretation of limits can be given in terms of the graph of a func-
tion. If 
is given, then we draw the horizontal lines 
and 
and
the graph of . (See Figure 4.) If 
, then we can ﬁnd a number 
such
that if we restrict 
to lie in the interval 
and take 
, then the curve
lies between the lines 
and 
. (See Figure 5.) You can see that
if such a has been found, then any smaller will also work.
It is important to realize that the process illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 must work for
every positive number , no matter how small it is chosen. Figure 6 shows that if a smaller
is chosen, then a smaller may be required.
EXAMPLE 1 Use a graph to ﬁnd a number such that
if
then
In other words, ﬁnd a number that corresponds to 
in the deﬁnition of a limit
for the function 
with

So we need to determine the values of for which the curve 
lies
between the horizontal lines 
and 
. Therefore we graph the curves
,
, and 
near the point 
in Figure 8. Then we use
the cursor to estimate that the -coordinate of the point of intersection of the line
and the curve 
is about 
. Similarly,
intersects the line 
when 
. So, rounding to be safe, we can say that
if
This interval 
is not symmetric about 
. The distance from 
to the
left endpoint is 
and the distance to the right endpoint is 0.12. We can
choose to be the smaller of these numbers, that is,
. Then we can rewrite our
inequalities in terms of distances as follows:
if
This just says that by keeping within 0.08 of 1, we are able to keep 
within 0.2 
of 2.
Although we chose 
, any smaller positive value of would also have
worked.
M
The graphical procedure in Example 1 gives an illustration of the deﬁnition for
,
but it does not prove that the limit is equal to 2. A proof has to provide a for every .
In proving limit statements it may be helpful to think of the deﬁnition of limit as a chal-
lenge. First it challenges you with a number . Then you must be able to produce a suit-
able . You have to be able to do this for every 
, not just a particular .
Imagine a contest between two people, A and B, and imagine yourself to be B. Person
A stipulates that the ﬁxed number should be approximated by the values of 
to with-
in a degree of accuracy 
(say, 0.01). Person B then responds by ﬁnding a number 
such
that if 
, then 
. Then A may become more exacting and
challenge B with a smaller value of 
(say, 0.0001). Again B has to respond by ﬁnding a
corresponding . Usually the smaller the value of , the smaller the corresponding value
of must be. If B always wins, no matter how small A makes , then

Note that in the solution of Example 2 there were two stages—guessing and proving.
We made a preliminary analysis that enabled us to guess a value for . But then in the sec-
ond stage we had to go back and prove in a careful, logical fashion that we had made a
correct guess. This procedure is typical of much of mathematics. Sometimes it is neces-
sary to ﬁrst make an intelligent guess about the answer to a problem and then prove that
the guess is correct.
The intuitive deﬁnitions of one-sided limits that were given in Section 2.2 can be pre-
cisely reformulated as follows.

After the invention of calculus in the 17th cen-
tury, there followed a period of free development
of the subject in the 18th century. Mathemati-
cians like the Bernoulli brothers and Euler were
eager to exploit the power of calculus and boldly
explored the consequences of this new and 
wonderful mathematical theory without worrying
too much about whether their proofs were com-
pletely correct.
The 19th century, by contrast, was the Age of
Rigor in mathematics. There was a movement to
go back to the foundations of the subject—to
provide careful deﬁnitions and rigorous proofs.
At the forefront of this movement was the 
French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy
(1789–1857), who started out as a military engi-
neer before becoming a mathematics professor
in Paris. Cauchy took Newton’s idea of a limit,
which was kept alive in the 18th century by the
French mathematician Jean d’Alembert, and
made it more precise. His deﬁnition of a limit
reads as follows: “When the successive values
attributed to a variable approach indeﬁnitely a
ﬁxed value so as to end by differing from it by 
as little as one wishes, this last is called the
limit of all the others.” But when Cauchy used
this deﬁnition in examples and proofs, he often
employed delta-epsilon inequalities similar to 
the ones in this section. A typical Cauchy proof
starts with: “Designate by and two very
small numbers; . . .” He used because of the
correspondence between epsilon and the French
word erreur and 
because delta corresponds to
diff´erence. Later, the German mathematician
Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897) stated the deﬁni-
tion of a limit exactly as in our Deﬁnition 2.

We can ﬁnd such a number

In fact, since we are interested only in values of that are close to 3, it is reasonable 
to assume that is within a distance l from 3, that is,

Fortunately this is unnecessary because the Limit Laws stated in Section 2.3 can be proved
using Deﬁnition 2, and then the limits of complicated functions can be found rigorously
from the Limit Laws without resorting to the deﬁnition directly.
For instance, we prove the Sum Law: If 
and 
both
exist, then
The remaining laws are proved in the exercises and in Appendix F.

Inﬁnite limits can also be deﬁned in a precise way. The following is a precise version of
Deﬁnition 4 in Section 2.2.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on some open interval that contains
the number , except possibly at itself. Then
means that for every positive number 
there is a positive number such that
if
This says that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily large (larger than any given
number 
) by taking close enough to (within a distance , where depends on 
, but
with 
). A geometric illustration is shown in Figure 10.
Given any horizontal line 
, we can ﬁnd a number 
such that if we restrict
to lie in the interval 
but 
, then the curve 
lies above the line
. You can see that if a larger 
is chosen, then a smaller may be required.

CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES

SECTION 2.5 CONTINUITY

119
CONTINUITY
We noticed in Section 2.3 that the limit of a function as approaches can often be found
simply by calculating the value of the function at . Functions with this property are called
continuous at a. We will see that the mathematical deﬁnition of continuity corresponds
closely with the meaning of the word continuity in everyday language. (A continuous
process is one that takes place gradually, without interruption or abrupt change.)
DEFINITION A function 
is continuous at a number a if
Notice that Deﬁnition l implicitly requires three things if 
is continuous at a:
1.
is deﬁned (that is, a is in the domain of )
2.
exists
3.
The deﬁnition says that 
is continuous at if 
approaches 
as x approaches a.
Thus a continuous function 
has the property that a small change in x produces only a
small change in 
. In fact, the change in 
can be kept as small as we please by keep-
ing the change in sufﬁciently small.
If 
is deﬁned near 
(in other words,
is deﬁned on an open interval containing ,
except perhaps at ), we say that 
is discontinuous at a (or 
has a discontinuity at ) if
is not continuous at .
Physical phenomena are usually continuous. For instance, the displacement or velocity
of a vehicle varies continuously with time, as does a person’s height. But discontinuities
do occur in such situations as electric currents. [See Example 6 in Section 2.2, where the
Heaviside function is discontinuous at because 
does not exist.]
Geometrically, you can think of a function that is continuous at every number in an
interval as a function whose graph has no break in it. The graph can be drawn without
removing your pen from the paper.
EXAMPLE 1 Figure 2 shows the graph of a function f. At which numbers is f discontinu-
ous? Why?
SOLUTION It looks as if there is a discontinuity when a ! 1 because the graph has a break
there. The ofﬁcial reason that f is discontinuous at 1 is that 
is not deﬁned.
The graph also has a break when 
, but the reason for the discontinuity is differ-
ent. Here,
is deﬁned, but 
does not exist (because the left and right limits
are different). So f is discontinuous at 3.
What about 
? Here,
is deﬁned and 
exists (because the left and
right limits are the same). But
So 
is discontinuous at 5.
M
Now let’s see how to detect discontinuities when a function is deﬁned by a formula.

EXAMPLE 2 Where are each of the following functions discontinuous?
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
SOLUTION
(a) Notice that 
is not deﬁned, so f is discontinuous at 2. Later we’ll see why 
is
continuous at all other numbers.
(b) Here 
is deﬁned but
does not exist. (See Example 8 in Section 2.2.) So f is discontinuous at 0.
(c) Here 
is deﬁned and
exists. But 
so 
is not continuous at 2.
(d) The greatest integer function 
has discontinuities at all of the integers
because 
does not exist if is an integer. (See Example 10 and Exercise 49 in
Section 2.3.)
M
Figure 3 shows the graphs of the functions in Example 2. In each case the graph can’t
be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper because a hole or break or jump occurs in
the graph. The kind of discontinuity illustrated in parts (a) and (c) is called removable
because we could remove the discontinuity by redeﬁning 
at just the single number 2.
[The function 
is continuous.] The discontinuity in part (b) is called an inﬁ-
nite discontinuity. The discontinuities in part (d) are called jump discontinuities because
the function “jumps” from one value to another.

DEFINITION A function 
is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at
every number in the interval. (If f is deﬁned only on one side of an endpoint of the
interval, we understand continuous at the endpoint to mean continuous from the
right or continuous from the left.)

Instead of always using Deﬁnitions 1, 2, and 3 to verify the continuity of a function as
we did in Example 4, it is often convenient to use the next theorem, which shows how to
build up complicated continuous functions from simple ones.

PROOF Each of the ﬁve parts of this theorem follows from the corresponding Limit Law

This shows that

M
It follows from Theorem 4 and Deﬁnition 3 that if

val, then so are the functions

theorem was stated in Section 2.3 as the Direct Substitution Property.
THEOREM
(a) Any polynomial is continuous everywhere; that is, it is continuous on

(b) Any rational function is continuous wherever it is deﬁned; that is, it is contin-
uous on its domain.

(a) A polynomial is a function of the form
where 
are constants. We know that

This equation is precisely the statement that the function 
is a continuous 
function. Thus, by part 3 of Theorem 4, the function 
is continuous. Since 
is a sum of functions of this form and a constant function, it follows from part 1 of 
Theorem 4 that 
is continuous.

(b) A rational function is a function of the form
where 
and 
are polynomials. The domain of 
is 
. We know
from part (a) that 
and 
are continuous everywhere. Thus, by part 5 of Theorem 4,
is continuous at every number in .
M
As an illustration of Theorem 5, observe that the volume of a sphere varies continuously
with its radius because the formula 
shows that 
is a polynomial function 
of . Likewise, if a ball is thrown vertically into the air with a velocity of 50 ft#s, then the 
height of the ball in feet seconds later is given by the formula 
. Again this
is a polynomial function, so the height is a continuous function of the elapsed time.
Knowledge of which functions are continuous enables us to evaluate some limits very
quickly, as the following example shows. Compare it with Example 2(b) in Section 2.3.
EXAMPLE 5 Find 
.
SOLUTION The function
is rational, so by Theorem 5 it is continuous on its domain, which is 
. 
Therefore
M
It turns out that most of the familiar functions are continuous at every number in their
domains. For instance, Limit Law 10 (page 101) is exactly the statement that root functions
are continuous.
From the appearance of the graphs of the sine and cosine functions (Figure 18 in
Section 1.2), we would certainly guess that they are continuous. We know from the deﬁni-
tions of 
and 
that the coordinates of the point P in Figure 5 are 
. As
, we see that P approaches the point 
and so 
and 
. Thus
Since 
and 
, the equations in (6) assert that the cosine and sine func-
tions are continuous at 0. The addition formulas for cosine and sine can then be used to 
deduce that these functions are continuous everywhere (see Exercises 56 and 57).
It follows from part 5 of Theorem 4 that

(see Figure 6).
The inverse function of any continuous one-to-one function is also continuous. (This
fact is proved in Appendix F, but our geometric intuition makes it seem plausible: The
graph of 
is obtained by reﬂecting the graph of f about the line 
. So if the graph
of f has no break in it, neither does the graph of 
.) Thus the inverse trigonometric func-
tions are continuous.
In Section 1.5 we deﬁned the exponential function 
so as to ﬁll in the holes in the
graph of 
where x is rational. In other words, the very deﬁnition of

it a continuous function on !. Therefore its inverse function 
is continuous 
on

THEOREM The following types of functions are continuous at every number in
their domains:
polynomials
rational functions
root functions
trigonometric functions
inverse trigonometric functions
exponential functions
logarithmic functions
EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function 
continuous?
SOLUTION We know from Theorem 7 that the function 
is continuous for 
and 
is continuous on !. Thus, by part 1 of Theorem 4,
is
continuous on 
. The denominator,
, is a polynomial, so it is continuous
everywhere. Therefore, by part 5 of Theorem 4, f is continuous at all positive numbers x
except where

and

SOLUTION Theorem 7 tells us that

nator,

ous. Notice that this function is never 0 because

is continuous everywhere. Hence, by deﬁnition of a continuous function,

Another way of combining continuous functions

Thus

Theorem 9,

An important property of continuous functions is expressed by the following theorem,
whose proof is found in more advanced books on calculus.
THE INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM Suppose that 
is continuous on the
closed interval 
and let 
be any number between 
and 
, where
. Then there exists a number in 
such that 
.
The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function takes on every inter-
mediate value between the function values 
and 
. It is illustrated by Figure 8. Note
that the value 
can be taken on once [as in part (a)] or more than once [as in part (b)].
If we think of a continuous function as a function whose graph has no hole or break,
then it is easy to believe that the Intermediate Value Theorem is true. In geometric terms it
says that if any horizontal line 
is given between 
and 
as in Fig-
ure 9, then the graph of 
can’t jump over the line. It must intersect 
somewhere.
It is important that the function in Theorem 10 be continuous. The Intermediate Value
Theorem is not true in general for discontinuous functions (see Exercise 44).
One use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is in locating roots of equations as in the
following example.

EXAMPLE 10 Show that there is a root of the equation
between 1 and 2.
SOLUTION Let 
. We are looking for a solution of the given
equation, that is, a number between 1 and 2 such that 
. Therefore, we take
,
, and 
in Theorem 10. We have
and
Thus 
; that is,
is a number between 
and 
. Now 
is
continuous since it is a polynomial, so the Intermediate Value Theorem says there 
is a number between 1 and 2 such that 
. In other words, the equation
has at least one root in the interval 
.
In fact, we can locate a root more precisely by using the Intermediate Value Theorem
again. Since
a root must lie between 1.2 and 1.3. A calculator gives, by trial and error,
so a root lies in the interval 
.
M
We can use a graphing calculator or computer to illustrate the use of the Intermediate
Value Theorem in Example 10. Figure 10 shows the graph of 
in the viewing rectangle
by 
and you can see that the graph crosses the -axis between 1 and 2. Fig-
ure 11 shows the result of zooming in to the viewing rectangle 
by 
.
In fact, the Intermediate Value Theorem plays a role in the very way these graphing
devices work. A computer calculates a ﬁnite number of points on the graph and turns on
the pixels that contain these calculated points. It assumes that the function is continuous
and takes on all the intermediate values between two consecutive points. The computer
therefore connects the pixels by turning on the intermediate pixels.

LIMITS AT INFINITY; HORIZONTAL ASYMPTOTES
In Sections 2.2 and 2.4 we investigated inﬁnite limits and vertical asymptotes. There we
let 
approach a number and the result was that the values of 
became arbitrarily large
(positive or negative). In this section we let 
become arbitrarily large (positive or nega-
tive) and see what happens to .
Let’s begin by investigating the behavior of the function 
deﬁned by 
as becomes large. The table at the left gives values of this function correct to six decimal
places, and the graph of 
has been drawn by a computer in Figure 1.
As 
grows larger and larger you can see that the values of 
get closer and closer 
to 1. In fact, it seems that we can make the values of 
as close as we like to 1 by taking
sufﬁciently large. This situation is expressed symbolically by writing

In general, we use the notation
to indicate that the values of 
become closer and closer to 
as 
becomes larger and
larger.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on some interval 
. Then
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily close to 
by taking suf-
ﬁciently large.
Another notation for 
is
as
The symbol 
does not represent a number. Nonetheless, the expression
is
often read as 
“the limit of 
, as approaches inﬁnity, is ”
or
“the limit of 
, as becomes inﬁnite, is ”
or
“the limit of 
, as increases without bound, is ”
The meaning of such phrases is given by Deﬁnition 1. A more precise deﬁnition, similar
to the 
deﬁnition of Section 2.4, is given at the end of this section.
Geometric illustrations of Deﬁnition 1 are shown in Figure 2. Notice that there are
many ways for the graph of 
to approach the line 
(which is called a horizontal
asymptote) as we look to the far right of each graph.
Referring back to Figure 1, we see that for numerically large negative values of , the
values of 
are close to 1. By letting decrease through negative values without bound,
we can make 
as close as we like to 1. This is expressed by writing
The general deﬁnition is as follows.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on some interval 
. Then 
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily close to 
by taking suf-
ﬁciently large negative.

Again, the symbol 
does not represent a number, but the expression
is often read as
“the limit of 
, as x approaches negative inﬁnity, is L”
Deﬁnition 2 is illustrated in Figure 3. Notice that the graph approaches the line 
as
we look to the far left of each graph.
DEFINITION The line 
is called a horizontal asymptote of the curve
if either 
For instance, the curve illustrated in Figure 1 has the line 
as a horizontal asymp-
tote because 
An example of a curve with two horizontal asymptotes is 
. (See Figure 4.) 
In fact,
so both of the lines 
and 
are horizontal asymptotes. (This follows from
the fact that the lines 
are vertical asymptotes of the graph of tan.)
EXAMPLE 1 Find the inﬁnite limits, limits at inﬁnity, and asymptotes for the function f
whose graph is shown in Figure 5.
SOLUTION We see that the values of 
become large as 
from both sides, so
Notice that 
becomes large negative as x approaches 2 from the left, but large posi-
tive as x approaches 2 from the right. So
Thus both of the lines 
and 
are vertical asymptotes.
As x becomes large, it appears that 
approaches 4. But as x decreases through
negative values,
approaches 2. So
This means that both y ! 4 and y ! 2 are horizontal asymptotes.

SOLUTION Observe that when is large,
is small. For instance,
In fact, by taking large enough, we can make 
as close to 0 as we please. Therefore,
according to Deﬁnition 1, we have 
Similar reasoning shows that when is large negative,
is small negative, so we also
have
It follows that the line 
(the -axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the curve 
.
(This is an equilateral hyperbola; see Figure 6.)
M
Most of the Limit Laws that were given in Section 2.3 also hold for limits at inﬁnity. It
can be proved that the Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 (with the exception of Laws 9 and
10) are also valid if “
” is replaced by “
” or “
.” In particular, if we
combine Laws 6 and 11 with the results of Example 2, we obtain the following important
rule for calculating limits.
THEOREM If

If

is deﬁned for all x, then
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate
and indicate which properties of limits are used at each stage.
SOLUTION As becomes large, both numerator and denominator become large, so it isn’t
obvious what happens to their ratio. We need to do some preliminary algebra. 
To evaluate the limit at inﬁnity of any rational function, we ﬁrst divide both the
numerator and denominator by the highest power of that occurs in the denominator.

(We may assume that 
, since we are interested only in large values of .) In this
case the highest power of in the denominator is 
, so we have
(by Limit Law 5)
(by 1, 2, and 3)
(by 7 and Theorem 5)
A similar calculation shows that the limit as 
is also . Figure 7 illustrates the
results of these calculations by showing how the graph of the given rational function
approaches the horizontal asymptote

EXAMPLE 4 Find the horizontal and vertical asymptotes of the graph of the function
SOLUTION Dividing both numerator and denominator by and using the properties of lim-

(since
for 
)
Therefore the line 
is a horizontal asymptote of the graph of .
In computing the limit as

Therefore
Thus the line 
is also a horizontal asymptote.
A vertical asymptote is likely to occur when the denominator,
, is 0, that is,
when 
. If is close to and 
, then the denominator is close to 0 and 
is positive. The numerator 
is always positive, so 
is positive. Therefore
If is close to but 
, then 
and so 
is large negative. Thus
The vertical asymptote is 
. All three asymptotes are shown in Figure 8.
M
EXAMPLE 5 Compute 
.
SOLUTION Because both 
and x are large when x is large, it’s difﬁcult to see what
happens to their difference, so we use algebra to rewrite the function. We ﬁrst multiply
numerator and denominator by the conjugate radical:
The Squeeze Theorem could be used to show that this limit is 0. But an easier method is
to divide numerator and denominator by . Doing this and using the Limit Laws, we obtain
Figure 9 illustrates this result.

EXAMPLE 7 Evaluate

SOLUTION As x increases, the values of sin x oscillate between 1 and !1 inﬁnitely often
and so they don’t approach any deﬁnite number. Thus

SOLUTION When becomes large,

In fact, we can make

Similarly, when is large negative, so is

Looking at Figure 10 we see that
but, as Figure 12 demonstrates,
becomes large as 
at a much faster rate than
.
EXAMPLE 9 Find 
.
| SOLUTION It would be wrong to write
The Limit Laws can’t be applied to inﬁnite limits because 
is not a number (
can’t be deﬁned). However, we can write
because both and 
become arbitrarily large and so their product does too.
M
EXAMPLE 10 Find

SOLUTION As in Example 3, we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest
power of in the denominator, which is just x:
because

The next example shows that by using inﬁnite limits at inﬁnity, together with intercepts,
we can get a rough idea of the graph of a polynomial without having to plot a large num-
ber of points.
EXAMPLE 11 Sketch the graph of 
by ﬁnding its inter-
cepts and its limits as 
and as 
.
SOLUTION The -intercept is 
and the -intercepts are 
found by setting 
:
. Notice that since 
is positive, the function
doesn’t change sign at ; thus the graph doesn’t cross the -axis at . The graph crosses
the axis at 
and .
When is large positive, all three factors are large, so
When is large negative, the ﬁrst factor is large positive and the second and third factors
are both large negative, so 
Combining this information, we give a rough sketch of the graph in Figure 13.

PRECISE DEFINITIONS
Deﬁnition 1 can be stated precisely as follows.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on some interval 
. Then
means that for every 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
then
In words, this says that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily close to 
(within a
distance , where 
is any positive number) by taking 
sufﬁciently large (larger than 
,
where 
depends on ). Graphically it says that by choosing 
large enough (larger than
some number 
) we can make the graph of 
lie between the given horizontal lines
and 
as in Figure 14. This must be true no matter how small we
choose . Figure 15 shows that if a smaller value of 
is chosen, then a larger value of 
may be required.
Similarly, a precise version of Deﬁnition 2 is given by Deﬁnition 8, which is illustrated
in Figure 16.

In Example 3 we calculated that 
In the next example we use a graphing device to relate this statement to Deﬁnition 7 with
and 
.
EXAMPLE 12 Use a graph to ﬁnd a number 
such that 
then
SOLUTION We rewrite the given inequality as
We need to determine the values of for which the given curve lies between the horizon-
tal lines 
and 
. So we graph the curve and these lines in Figure 17. Then
we use the cursor to estimate that the curve crosses the line 
when 
. To
the right of this number the curve stays between the lines 
and 
. Round-
ing to be safe, we can say that
then
In other words, for 
we can choose 
(or any larger number) in Deﬁnition 7.

ric illustration is given in Figure 19.

DERIVATIVES AND RATES OF CHANGE
The problem of ﬁnding the tangent line to a curve and the problem of ﬁnding the velocity
of an object both involve ﬁnding the same type of limit, as we saw in Section 2.1. This spe-
cial type of limit is called a derivative and we will see that it can be interpreted as a rate
of change in any of the sciences or engineering.
TANGENTS
If a curve 
has equation 
and we want to ﬁnd the tangent line to 
at the point
, then we consider a nearby point 
, where 
, and compute the slope
of the secant line 
:
Then we let 
approach 
along the curve 
by letting approach . If 
approaches a
number 
, then we deﬁne the tangent t to be the line through 
with slope 
. (This

amounts to saying that the tangent line is the limiting position of the secant line 
as 
approaches . See Figure 1.)
DEFINITION The tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
is
the line through 
with slope
provided that this limit exists.
In our ﬁrst example we conﬁrm the guess we made in Example 1 in Section 2.1.
EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola 
at the 
point 
.
SOLUTION Here we have 
and 
, so the slope is
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we ﬁnd that an equation of the
tangent line at 
is
M
We sometimes refer to the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point as the slope of
the curve at the point. The idea is that if we zoom in far enough toward the point, the curve
looks almost like a straight line. Figure 2 illustrates this procedure for the curve 
in
Example 1. The more we zoom in, the more the parabola looks like a line. In other words,
the curve becomes almost indistinguishable from its tangent line.
There is another expression for the slope of a tangent line that is sometimes easier to
use. If 
, then 
and so the slope of the secant line 
is

VELOCITIES
In Section 2.1 we investigated the motion of a ball dropped from the CN Tower and deﬁned
its velocity to be the limiting value of average velocities over shorter and shorter time 
periods.
In general, suppose an object moves along a straight line according to an equation of
motion 
, where is the displacement (directed distance) of the object from the ori-
gin at time . The function 
that describes the motion is called the position function
of the object. In the time interval from 
to 
the change in position is
. (See Figure 5.) The average velocity over this time interval is
which is the same as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 6.
Now suppose we compute the average velocities over shorter and shorter time intervals
. In other words, we let 
approach . As in the example of the falling ball, we
deﬁne the velocity (or instantaneous velocity) 
at time 
to be the limit of these
average velocities:

This means that the velocity at time 
is equal to the slope of the tangent line at 
(compare Equations 2 and 3).
Now that we know how to compute limits, let’s reconsider the problem of the fall-
ing ball.
EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the 
CN Tower, 450 m above the ground.
(a) What is the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds?
(b) How fast is the ball traveling when it hits the ground?
SOLUTION We will need to ﬁnd the velocity both when 
and when the ball hits the
ground, so it’s efﬁcient to start by ﬁnding the velocity at a general time 
. Using the
equation of motion 
, we have
(a) The velocity after 5 s is 
m!s.
(b) Since the observation deck is 450 m above the ground, the ball will hit the ground at
the time 
when 
, that is,
This gives
The velocity of the ball as it hits the ground is therefore
M
DERIVATIVES
We have seen that the same type of limit arises in ﬁnding the slope of a tangent line
(Equation 2) or the velocity of an object (Equation 3). In fact, limits of the form
arise whenever we calculate a rate of change in any of the sciences or engineering, such as
a rate of reaction in chemistry or a marginal cost in economics. Since this type of limit
occurs so widely, it is given a special name and notation.
DEFINITION The derivative of a function 
at a number , denoted by
, is
if this limit exists.

If we write 
, then we have

approaches 
if and only if 
approaches . Therefore an equivalent way of stating the deﬁnition of the derivative, as we
saw in ﬁnding tangent lines, is
EXAMPLE 4 Find the derivative of the function

SOLUTION From Deﬁnition 4 we have
M
We deﬁned the tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
to be the line
that passes through 
and has slope 
given by Equation 1 or 2. Since, by Deﬁnition 4,
this is the same as the derivative 
, we can now say the following.
The tangent line to 
at 
is the line through 
whose slope is
equal to 
, the derivative of 
at .
If we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write an equation of the
tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
:

and the corresponding change in is
The difference quotient
is called the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval 
and
can be interpreted as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 8.
By analogy with velocity, we consider the average rate of change over smaller and
smaller intervals by letting 
approach 
and therefore letting 
approach . The limit
of these average rates of change is called the (instantaneous) rate of change of y with
respect to x at 
, which is interpreted as the slope of the tangent to the curve 
at 
:
We recognize this limit as being the derivative 
.
We know that one interpretation of the derivative 
is as the slope of the tangent line
to the curve 
when 
. We now have a second interpretation:
The derivative 
is the instantaneous rate of change of 
with respect 
to 
when 
.
The connection with the ﬁrst interpretation is that if we sketch the curve 
, then
the instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent to this curve at the point where
. This means that when the derivative is large (and therefore the curve is steep, as 
at the point 
in Figure 9), the -values change rapidly. When the derivative is small, the
curve is relatively ﬂat and the -values change slowly.
In particular, if 
is the position function of a particle that moves along a straight
line, then 
is the rate of change of the displacement 
with respect to the time . In
other words, 
is the velocity of the particle at time 
. The speed of the particle is
the absolute value of the velocity, that is, 
In the next example we discuss the meaning of the derivative of a function that is
deﬁned verbally.
EXAMPLE 6 A manufacturer produces bolts of a fabric with a ﬁxed width. The cost of
producing x yards of this fabric is 
dollars.
(a) What is the meaning of the derivative 
? What are its units?
(b) In practical terms, what does it mean to say that 
?
(c) Which do you think is greater, 
or 
? What about 
?
SOLUTION
(a) The derivative 
is the instantaneous rate of change of C with respect to x; that
is, 
means the rate of change of the production cost with respect to the number of
yards produced. (Economists call this rate of change the marginal cost. This idea is dis-
cussed in more detail in Sections 3.7 and 4.7.)

Because
the units for 
are the same as the units for the difference quotient 
. Since 
is measured in dollars and 
in yards, it follows that the units for 
are dollars
per yard.
(b) The statement that 
means that, after 1000 yards of fabric have been
manufactured, the rate at which the production cost is increasing is $9!yard. (When
, C is increasing 9 times as fast as x.)
Since 
is small compared with 
, we could use the approximation
and say that the cost of manufacturing the 1000th yard (or the 1001st) is about $9.
(c) The rate at which the production cost is increasing (per yard) is probably lower
when x ! 500 than when x ! 50 (the cost of making the 500th yard is less than the cost
of the 50th yard) because of economies of scale. (The manufacturer makes more efﬁcient
use of the ﬁxed costs of production.) So
But, as production expands, the resulting large-scale operation might become inefﬁcient
and there might be overtime costs. Thus it is possible that the rate of increase of costs
will eventually start to rise. So it may happen that
M
In the following example we estimate the rate of change of the national debt with respect
to time. Here the function is deﬁned not by a formula but by a table of values.

be the US national debt at time t. The table in the margin gives
approximate values of this function by providing end of year estimates, in billions of
dollars, from 1980 to 2000. Interpret and estimate the value of 
.
SOLUTION The derivative 
means the rate of change of D with respect to t when
, that is, the rate of increase of the national debt in 1990.
According to Equation 5,
So we compute and tabulate values of the difference quotient (the average rates of
change) as follows.

From this table we see that 
lies somewhere between 257.48 and 348.14 billion
dollars per year. [Here we are making the reasonable assumption that the debt didn’t
ﬂuctuate wildly between 1980 and 2000.] We estimate that the rate of increase of the
national debt of the United States in 1990 was the average of these two numbers, namely
Another method would be to plot the debt function and estimate the slope of the tan-
gent line when 
.

In Examples 3, 6, and 7 we saw three speciﬁc examples of rates of change: the veloci-
ty of an object is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time; marginal cost is
the rate of change of production cost with respect to the number of items produced; the
rate of change of the debt with respect to time is of interest in economics. Here is a small
sample of other rates of change: In physics, the rate of change of work with respect to time
is called power. Chemists who study a chemical reaction are interested in the rate of
change in the concentration of a reactant with respect to time (called the rate of reaction).
A biologist is interested in the rate of change of the population of a colony of bacteria with
respect to time. In fact, the computation of rates of change is important in all of the natu-
ral sciences, in engineering, and even in the social sciences. Further examples will be given
in Section 3.7.
All these rates of change are derivatives and can therefore be interpreted as slopes of
tangents. This gives added signiﬁcance to the solution of the tangent problem. Whenever
we solve a problem involving tangent lines, we are not just solving a problem in geome-
try. We are also implicitly solving a great variety of problems involving rates of change in
science and engineering.

are the units for

age rates of change, so it is measured in the
same units: billions of dollars per year.

The ﬁrst person to formulate explicitly the ideas of limits and derivatives was Sir Isaac Newton in
the 1660s. But Newton acknowledged that “If I have seen further than other men, it is because I
have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Two of those giants were Pierre Fermat (1601–1665) and
Newton’s teacher at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630–1677). Newton was familiar with the meth-
ods that these men used to ﬁnd tangent lines, and their methods played a role in Newton’s eventual
formulation of calculus.
The following references contain explanations of these methods. Read one or more of the
references and write a report comparing the methods of either Fermat or Barrow to modern 
methods. In particular, use the method of Section 2.7 to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line to the
curve 
at the point (1, 3) and show how either Fermat or Barrow would have solved
the same problem. Although you used derivatives and they did not, point out similarities between
the methods.

THE DERIVATIVE AS A FUNCTION
In the preceding section we considered the derivative of a function f at a ﬁxed number a:
.
Here we change our point of view and let the number a vary. If we replace a in Equation 1
by a variable x, we obtain
Given any number x for which this limit exists, we assign to x the number 
. So we can
regard 
as a new function, called the derivative of 
and deﬁned by Equation 2. We
know that the value of 
at ,
, can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the
tangent line to the graph of 
at the point 
.
The function 
is called the derivative of 
because it has been “derived” from 
by
the limiting operation in Equation 2. The domain of 
is the set 
exists and may
be smaller than the domain of .
EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function 
is given in Figure 1. Use it to sketch the graph
of the derivative .
SOLUTION We can estimate the value of the derivative at any value of by drawing the
tangent at the point 
and estimating its slope. For instance, for x ! 5 we draw 
the tangent at 
in Figure 2(a) and estimate its slope to be about , so 
. This
allows us to plot the point 
on the graph of 
directly beneath P. Repeating
this procedure at several points, we get the graph shown in Figure 2(b). Notice that the
tangents at ,
, and 
are horizontal, so the derivative is 0 there and the graph of 
crosses the -axis at the points 
,
, and 
, directly beneath A, B, and C. Between 
and 
the tangents have positive slope, so 
is positive there. But between 
and 
the tangents have negative slope, so 
is negative there.

these graphs serve as a check on our work in part (a).

Let’s check to see that the result of Example 3 is reasonable by looking at the graphs of

OTHER NOTATIONS
If we use the traditional notation 
to indicate that the independent variable is and
the dependent variable is , then some common alternative notations for the derivative are
as follows:
The symbols 
and 
are called differentiation operators because they indicate the
operation of differentiation, which is the process of calculating a derivative.
The symbol 
, which was introduced by Leibniz, should not be regarded as a ratio
(for the time being); it is simply a synonym for 
. Nonetheless, it is a very useful and
suggestive notation, especially when used in conjunction with increment notation. Refer-
ring to Equation 2.7.6, we can rewrite the deﬁnition of derivative in Leibniz notation in the
form
If we want to indicate the value of a derivative 
in Leibniz notation at a speciﬁc num-
ber , we use the notation
or
which is a synonym for 
.

SECTION 2.8 THE DERIVATIVE AS A FUNCTION

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig 
in 1646 and studied law, theology, philosophy, 
and mathematics at the university there, gradu-
ating with a bachelor’s degree at age 17. After
earning his doctorate in law at age 20, Leibniz
entered the diplomatic service and spent most of
his life traveling to the capitals of Europe on 
political missions. In particular, he worked to
avert a French military threat against Germany
and attempted to reconcile the Catholic and
Protestant churches.
His serious study of mathematics did not begin
until 1672 while he was on a diplomatic mission
in Paris. There he built a calculating machine and
met scientists, like Huygens, who directed his
attention to the latest developments in mathe-
matics and science. Leibniz sought to develop a
symbolic logic and system of notation that would
simplify logical reasoning. In particular, the ver-
sion of calculus that he published in 1684 estab-
lished the notation and the rules for ﬁnding
derivatives that we use today.
Unfortunately, a dreadful priority dispute arose
in the 1690s between the followers of Newton
and those of Leibniz as to who had invented 
calculus ﬁrst. Leibniz was even accused of pla-
giarism by members of the Royal Society in 
England. The truth is that each man invented 
calculus independently. Newton arrived at his 
version of calculus ﬁrst but, because of his fear 
of controversy, did not publish it immediately. So
Leibniz’s 1684 account of calculus was the ﬁrst 
to be published.
LEIBNIZ

For 
we have to investigate
Let’s compute the left and right limits separately:
and
Since these limits are different,
does not exist. Thus 
is differentiable at all 
except 0.
A formula for 
is given by  
and its graph is shown in Figure 5(b). The fact that 
does not exist is reﬂected geo-
metrically in the fact that the curve 
does not have a tangent line at 
. [See
Figure 5(a).]
M
Both continuity and differentiability are desirable properties for a function to have. The
following theorem shows how these properties are related.
THEOREM If 
is differentiable at , then 
is continuous at .
PROOF
To prove that 
is continuous at , we have to show that 
. We
do this by showing that the difference 
approaches 0.
The given information is that f is differentiable at a, that is,
exists (see Equation 2.7.5). To connect the given and the unknown, we divide and multi-
ply 
by 
(which we can do when 
):
Thus, using the Product Law and (2.7.5), we can write

The converse of Theorem 4 is false; that is, there are functions that are continuous
but not differentiable. For instance, the function 
is continuous at 0 because
(See Example 7 in Section 2.3.) But in Example 5 we showed that 
is not differentiable
at 0.
HOW CAN A FUNCTION FAIL TO BE DIFFERENTIABLE?
We saw that the function 
in Example 5 is not differentiable at 0 and Figure 5(a)
shows that its graph changes direction abruptly when 
. In general, if the graph of a
function 
has a “corner” or “kink” in it, then the graph of 
has no tangent at this point
and 
is not differentiable there. [In trying to compute 
, we ﬁnd that the left and right
limits are different.]
Theorem 4 gives another way for a function not to have a derivative. It says that if 
is
not continuous at , then 
is not differentiable at . So at any discontinuity (for instance,
a jump discontinuity) 
fails to be differentiable.
A third possibility is that the curve has a vertical tangent line when 
; that is,
is continuous at and
This means that the tangent lines become steeper and steeper as 
. Figure 6 shows one
way that this can happen; Figure 7(c) shows another. Figure 7 illustrates the three possi-
bilities that we have discussed.
A graphing calculator or computer provides another way of looking at differentiabil-
ity. If 
is differentiable at , then when we zoom in toward the point

example of this in Figure 2 in Section 2.7.) But no matter how much we zoom in toward a
point like the ones in Figures 6 and 7(a), we can’t eliminate the sharp point or corner (see
Figure 9).
HIGHER DERIVATIVES
If 
is a differentiable function, then its derivative 
is also a function, so 
may have a
derivative of its own, denoted by 
. This new function 
is called the second
derivative of 
because it is the derivative of the derivative of . Using Leibniz notation,
we write the second derivative of 
as
EXAMPLE 6 If 
, ﬁnd and interpret 
.
SOLUTION In Example 2 we found that the ﬁrst derivative is 
. So the sec-
ond derivative is
The graphs of , 
, 
are shown in Figure 10.
We can interpret 
as the slope of the curve 
at the point 
. In
other words, it is the rate of change of the slope of the original curve 
.
Notice from Figure 10 that 
is negative when 
has negative slope 
and positive when 
has positive slope. So the graphs serve as a check on our 
calculations.
M
In general, we can interpret a second derivative as a rate of change of a rate of change.
The most familiar example of this is acceleration, which we deﬁne as follows.
If 
is the position function of an object that moves in a straight line, we know
that its ﬁrst derivative represents the velocity 
of the object as a function of time:

The instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the acceleration
of the object. Thus the acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function
and is therefore the second derivative of the position function:
or, in Leibniz notation,
The third derivative
is the derivative of the second derivative: 
. So
can be interpreted as the slope of the curve 
or as the rate of change of
. If 
, then alternative notations for the third derivative are
The process can be continued. The fourth derivative 
is usually denoted by 
. In gen-
eral, the th derivative of 
is denoted by 
and is obtained from 
by differentiating 
times. If 
, we write

SOLUTION In Example 6 we found that 
. The graph of the second derivative has
equation 
and so it is a straight line with slope 6. Since the derivative 
is the
slope of 
, we have
for all values of . So 
is a constant function and its graph is a horizontal line. There-
fore, for all values of ,
M
We can interpret the third derivative physically in the case where the function is the
position function 
of an object that moves along a straight line. Because
, the third derivative of the position function is the derivative of the accel-
eration function and is called the jerk:
Thus the jerk j is the rate of change of acceleration. It is aptly named because a large jerk
means a sudden change in acceleration, which causes an abrupt movement in a vehicle.
We have seen that one application of second and third derivatives occurs in analyzing
the motion of objects using acceleration and jerk. We will investigate another applica-
tion of second derivatives in Section 4.3, where we show how knowledge of 
gives us
information about the shape of the graph of . In Chapter 11 we will see how second and
higher derivatives enable us to represent functions as sums of inﬁnite series.

In our discussion of the principles of problem solving we considered the problem-solving
strategy of introducing something extra (see page 76). In the following example we show
how this principle is sometimes useful when we evaluate limits. The idea is to change the
variable—to introduce a new variable that is related to the original variable—in such a way
as to make the problem simpler. Later, in Section 5.5, we will make more extensive use of
this general idea.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where c is a nonzero constant.
SOLUTION As it stands, this limit looks challenging. In Section 2.3 we evaluated several lim-
its in which both numerator and denominator approached 0. There our strategy was to per-
form some sort of algebraic manipulation that led to a simplifying cancellation, but here
it’s not clear what kind of algebra is necessary.
So we introduce a new variable t by the equation
We also need to express x in terms of t, so we solve this equation:
Notice that 
is equivalent to 
. This allows us to convert the given limit into one
involving the variable t:
The change of variable allowed us to replace a relatively complicated limit by a simpler
one of a type that we have seen before. Factoring the denominator as a difference of
cubes, we get
M
The following problems are meant to test and challenge your problem-solving skills.
Some of them require a considerable amount of time to think through, so don’t be discour-
aged if you can’t solve them right away. If you get stuck, you might ﬁnd it helpful to refer
to the discussion of the principles of problem solving on page 76.

We have seen how to interpret derivatives as slopes and rates of change. We have seen
how to estimate derivatives of functions given by tables of values. We have learned 
how to graph derivatives of functions that are deﬁned graphically. We have used the
deﬁnition of a derivative to calculate the derivatives of functions deﬁned by formulas.
But it would be tedious if we always had to use the deﬁnition, so in this chapter we
develop rules for ﬁnding derivatives without having to use the deﬁnition directly. These
differentiation rules enable us to calculate with relative ease the derivatives of poly-
nomials, rational functions, algebraic functions, exponential and logarithmic functions,
and trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions. We then use these rules to solve
problems involving rates of change and the approximation of functions.
By measuring slopes at points on the sine curve,
we get strong visual evidence that the derivative 
of the sine function is the cosine function.

DERIVATIVES OF POLYNOMIALS AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
In this section we learn how to differentiate constant functions, power functions, polyno-
mials, and exponential functions.
Let’s start with the simplest of all functions, the constant function 
. The graph
of this function is the horizontal line y ! c, which has slope 0, so we must have 
.
(See Figure 1.) A formal proof, from the deﬁnition of a derivative, is also easy:
In Leibniz notation, we write this rule as follows.

POWER FUNCTIONS
We next look at the functions 
, where n is a positive integer. If 
, the graph
of 
is the line y ! x, which has slope 1. (See Figure 2.) So
(You can also verify Equation 1 from the deﬁnition of a derivative.) We have already 
investigated the cases 
and 
. In fact, in Section 2.8 (Exercises 17 and 18) we
found that

be true.

The formula
can be veriﬁed simply by multiplying out the right-hand side (or by summing the second
factor as a geometric series). If 
, we can use Equation 2.7.5 for 
and the
equation above to write
SECOND PROOF
In ﬁnding the derivative of 
we had to expand 
. Here we need to expand
and we use the Binomial Theorem to do so:
because every term except the ﬁrst has as a factor and therefore approaches 0.

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES
N The Binomial Theorem is given on 
Reference Page 1.

What about power functions with negative integer exponents? In Exercise 61 we ask
you to verify from the deﬁnition of a derivative that
We can rewrite this equation as
and so the Power Rule is true when 
. In fact, we will show in the next section
[Exercise 58(c)] that it holds for all negative integers.
What if the exponent is a fraction? In Example 3 in Section 2.8 we found that
which can be written as
This shows that the Power Rule is true even when 
. In fact, we will show in Sec-
tion 3.6 that it is true for all real numbers n.

The Power Rule enables us to ﬁnd tangent lines without having to resort to the deﬁ-
nition of a derivative. It also enables us to ﬁnd normal lines. The normal line to a curve 
at a point 
is the line through 
that is perpendicular to the tangent line at . (In the study
of optics, one needs to consider the angle between a light ray and the normal line to a lens.)

So the slope of the tangent line at (1, 1) is

The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, so its slope is the negative recipro-
cal of , that is,

NEW DERIVATIVES FROM OLD
When new functions are formed from old functions by addition, subtraction, or multipli-
cation by a constant, their derivatives can be calculated in terms of derivatives of the old
functions. In particular, the following formula says that the derivative of a constant times
a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.

EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
Let’s try to compute the derivative of the exponential function 
using the deﬁni-
tion of a derivative:
The factor 
doesn’t depend on h, so we can take it in front of the limit:
Notice that the limit is the value of the derivative of 
at , that is,
Therefore we have shown that if the exponential function 
is differentiable at 0,
then it is differentiable everywhere and
This equation says that the rate of change of any exponential function is proportional to
the function itself. (The slope is proportional to the height.)

DERIVATIVE OF THE NATURAL EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION
Thus the exponential function 
has the property that it is its own derivative.
The geometrical signiﬁcance of this fact is that the slope of a tangent line to the curve
is equal to the -coordinate of the point (see Figure 7).

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES
Suppose you are asked to design the ﬁrst ascent and drop for a new roller coaster. By studying

slope of the drop 
. You decide to connect these two straight stretches 
and
with part of a parabola 
, where and

ure.) To simplify the equations you decide to place the origin at .
1. (a) Suppose the horizontal distance between 
and 
is 100 ft. Write equations in , , and 
that will ensure that the track is smooth at the transition points.
(b) Solve the equations in part (a) for

(c) Plot

to verify graphically that the transitions are smooth.
(d) Find the difference in elevation between

2. The solution in Problem 1 might look smooth, but it might not feel smooth because the piece-
wise deﬁned function [consisting of 
for 
, 
for 
, and 
for
] doesn’t have a continuous second derivative. So you decide to improve the design by
using a quadratic function 
only on the interval 
and con-
necting it to the linear functions by means of two cubic functions:
(a) Write a system of equations in 11 unknowns that ensure that the functions and their ﬁrst
two derivatives agree at the transition points.
(b) Solve the equations in part (a) with a computer algebra system to ﬁnd formulas for
.
(c) Plot

THE PRODUCT AND QUOTIENT RULES
The formulas of this section enable us to differentiate new functions formed from old func-
tions by multiplication or division.
THE PRODUCT RULE
| By analogy with the Sum and Difference Rules, one might be tempted to guess, as  Leibniz
did three centuries ago, that the derivative of a product is the product of the derivatives. We
can see, however, that this guess is wrong by looking at a particular example. Let 
and 
. Then the Power Rule gives 
and 
. But 
, so
. Thus 
. The correct formula was discovered by Leibniz (soon
after his false start) and is called the Product Rule.
Before stating the Product Rule, let’s see how we might discover it. We start by assum-
ing that 
and 
are both positive differentiable functions. Then we can
interpret the product 
as an area of a rectangle (see Figure 1). If x changes by an amount
, then the corresponding changes in u and are
and the new value of the product, 
, can be interpreted as the area of the
large rectangle in Figure 1 (provided that 
and 
happen to be positive).
The change in the area of the rectangle is
 ! the sum of the three shaded areas

The geometry of the Product Rule

If we divide by

If we now let 
, we get the derivative of 
:
(Notice that 
as 
since 
is differentiable and therefore continuous.)
Although we started by assuming (for the geometric interpretation) that all the quanti-
ties are positive, we notice that Equation 1 is always true. (The algebra is valid whether u,
, 
, and 
are positive or negative.) So we have proved Equation 2, known as the
Product Rule, for all differentiable functions u and .
THE PRODUCT RULE If 
and are both differentiable, then
In words, the Product Rule says that the derivative of a product of two functions is the
ﬁrst function times the derivative of the second function plus the second function times the
derivative of the ﬁrst function.

Don’t use the Quotient Rule every time you see a quotient. Sometimes it’s eas-
ier to rewrite a quotient ﬁrst to put it in a form that is simpler for the purpose of differen-
tiation. For instance, although it is possible to differentiate the function
using the Quotient Rule, it is much easier to perform the division ﬁrst and write the func-
tion as
before differentiating.
We summarize the differentiation formulas we have learned so far as follows.

DERIVATIVES OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Before starting this section, you might need to review the trigonometric functions. In par-
ticular, it is important to remember that when we talk about the function 
deﬁned for all
real numbers by
it is understood that 
means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is . A simi-
lar convention holds for the other trigonometric functions cos, tan, csc, sec, and cot. Recall
from Section 2.5 that all of the trigonometric functions are continuous at every number in
their domains.
If we sketch the graph of the function 
and use the interpretation of 
as the slope of the tangent to the sine curve in order to sketch the graph of

tion of a derivative, we have

puting a limit as

Trigonometric functions are often used in modeling real-world phenomena. In particu-
lar, vibrations, waves, elastic motions, and other quantities that vary in a periodic manner
can be described using trigonometric functions. In the following example we discuss an
instance of simple harmonic motion.

THE CHAIN RULE
Suppose you are asked to differentiate the function 
The differentiation formulas you learned in the previous sections of this chapter do not
enable you to calculate 
.
Observe that 
is a composite function. In fact, if we let 
and let
, then we can write 
, that is, 
. We know
how to differentiate both 
and , so it would be useful to have a rule that tells us how to
ﬁnd the derivative of 
in terms of the derivatives of 
and .
It turns out that the derivative of the composite function 
is the product of the deriv-
atives of 
and . This fact is one of the most important of the differentiation rules and is
called the Chain Rule. It seems plausible if we interpret derivatives as rates of change.
Regard 
as the rate of change of 
with respect to , 
as the rate of change of
with respect to , and 
as the rate of change of 
with respect to . If 
changes
twice as fast as 
and 
changes three times as fast as , then it seems reasonable that 
changes six times as fast as , and so we expect that 
THE CHAIN RULE If t is differentiable at and is differentiable at

COMMENTS ON THE PROOF OF THE CHAIN RULE
Let 
be the change in corresponding to a
change of 
in , that is,
Then the corresponding change in is 
It is tempting to write
The only ﬂaw in this reasoning is that in (1) it might happen that 
(even when
) and, of course, we can’t divide by 0. Nonetheless, this reasoning does at least
suggest that the Chain Rule is true. A full proof of the Chain Rule is given at the end of
this section.
M
The Chain Rule can be written either in the prime notation
or, if 
and 
, in Leibniz notation:
Equation 3 is easy to remember because if 
and 
were quotients, then we could
cancel 
. Remember, however, that 
has not been deﬁned and 
should not be
thought of as an actual quotient.

When using Formula 3 we should bear in mind that 
refers to the derivative of 
when is considered as a function of (called the derivative of
with respect to ), where-
as 
refers to the derivative of when considered as a function of (the derivative of
with respect to ). For instance, in Example 1, 
can be considered as a function of 
and also as a function of 
. Note that
whereas
In using the Chain Rule we work from the outside to the inside. Formula 2 says
that we differentiate the outer function 
[at the inner function 
] and then we multiply
by the derivative of the inner function.
EXAMPLE 2 Differentiate (a) 
and (b) 
.
SOLUTION
(a) If 
, then the outer function is the sine function and the inner function is
the squaring function, so the Chain Rule gives
(b) Note that 
. Here the outer function is the squaring function and the
inner function is the sine function. So
The answer can be left as 
or written as 
(by a trigonometric identity
known as the double-angle formula).

In Example 2(a) we combined the Chain Rule with the rule for differentiating the sine

Thus
In a similar fashion, all of the formulas for differentiating trigonometric functions can
be combined with the Chain Rule.
Let’s make explicit the special case of the Chain Rule where the outer function 
is a
power function. If

the Chain Rule and then the Power Rule, we get

If we deﬁne

for a differentiable function f, we can write
and

. This property of differentiable functions is what
enables us to prove the Chain Rule.
PROOF OF THE CHAIN RULE
Suppose 
is differentiable at a and 
is differen-
tiable at 
. If 
is an increment in x and 
and 
are the corresponding incre-
ments in u and y, then we can use Equation 7 to write
where 
as 
. Similarly
where 
as 
. If we now substitute the expression for 
from Equation 8
into Equation 9, we get
so
As 
, Equation 8 shows that 
. So both 
and 
as 
.
Therefore
This proves the Chain Rule.

The functions that we have met so far can be described by expressing one variable explic-
itly in terms of another variable—for example,
or
or, in general, 
. Some functions, however, are deﬁned implicitly by a relation
between and such as
or
In some cases it is possible to solve such an equation for as an explicit function (or sev-
eral functions) of . For instance, if we solve Equation 1 for , we get 
, 
so two of the functions determined by the implicit Equation l are 
and
. The graphs of 
and 
are the upper and lower semicircles of the 
circle 
. (See Figure 1.)
It’s not easy to solve Equation 2 for 
explicitly as a function of 
by hand. (A com-
puter algebra system has no trouble, but the expressions it obtains are very complicated.)

Nonetheless, (2) is the equation of a curve called the folium of Descartes shown in 
Figure 2 and it implicitly deﬁnes as several functions of . The graphs of three such func-
tions are shown in Figure 3. When we say that 
is a function deﬁned implicitly by Equa-
tion 2, we mean that the equation
is true for all values of in the domain of .
Fortunately, we don’t need to solve an equation for in terms of

derivative of . Instead we can use the method of implicit differentiation. This consists of
differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to

equation for

given equation determines implicitly as a differentiable function of so that the method
of implicit differentiation can be applied.

There is a formula for the three roots of a cubic equation that is like the quad-
ratic formula but much more complicated. If we use this formula (or a computer algebra
system) to solve the equation

determined by the equation: 
and
(These are the three functions whose graphs are shown in Figure 3.) You can see that the
method of implicit differentiation saves an enormous amount of work in cases such as this.
Moreover, implicit differentiation works just as easily for equations such as

of Logarithms to simplify.

sion of the Power Rule, as promised in Section 3.1.

You should distinguish carefully between the Power Rule

base is variable and the exponent is constant, and the rule for differentiating exponential
functions

RATES OF CHANGE IN THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
We know that if 
, then the derivative 
can be interpreted as the rate of change
of with respect to . In this section we examine some of the applications of this idea to
physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and other sciences.
Let’s recall from Section 2.7 the basic idea behind rates of change. If 
changes from
to 
, then the change in is
and the corresponding change in is
The difference quotient 
is the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval 
and can be
interpreted as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 1. Its limit as 
is the deriv-
ative 
, which can therefore be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change of y
with respect to x or the slope of the tangent line at 
. Using Leibniz notation,
we write the process in the form
Whenever the function 
has a speciﬁc interpretation in one of the sciences, its
derivative will have a speciﬁc interpretation as a rate of change. (As we discussed in Sec-
tion 2.7, the units for 
are the units for y divided by the units for x.) We now look at
some of these interpretations in the natural and social sciences.
PHYSICS
If 
is the position function of a particle that is moving in a straight line, then 
represents the average velocity over a time period 
, and 
represents the instan-
taneous velocity (the rate of change of displacement with respect to time). The instanta-
neous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is acceleration: 
.
This was discussed in Sections 2.7 and 2.8, but now that we know the differentiation for-
mulas, we are able to solve problems involving the motion of objects more easily.
EXAMPLE 1 The position of a particle is given by the equation
where is measured in seconds and in meters.
(a) Find the velocity at time .
(b) What is the velocity after 2 s? After 4 s?
(c) When is the particle at rest?
(d) When is the particle moving forward (that is, in the positive direction)?
(e) Draw a diagram to represent the motion of the particle.
(f) Find the total distance traveled by the particle during the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds.

(g) Find the acceleration at time and after 4 s.
(h) Graph the position, velocity, and acceleration functions for

(i) When is the particle speeding up? When is it slowing down?
SOLUTION
(a) The velocity function is the derivative of the position function.
(b) The velocity after 2 s means the instantaneous velocity when 
, that is,
The velocity after 4 s is
(c) The particle is at rest when 
, that is,
and this is true when 
or 
. Thus the particle is at rest after 1 s and after 3 s.
(d) The particle moves in the positive direction when 
, that is, 
This inequality is true when both factors are positive 
or when both factors are
negative 
. Thus the particle moves in the positive direction in the time intervals
and 
. It moves backward (in the negative direction) when 
.
(e) Using the information from part (d) we make a schematic sketch in Figure 2 of the
motion of the particle back and forth along a line (the -axis).
(f) Because of what we learned in parts (d) and (e), we need to calculate the distances
traveled during the time intervals [0, 1], [1, 3], and [3, 5] separately.
The distance traveled in the ﬁrst second is
From 
to 
the distance traveled is

(i) The particle speeds up when the velocity is positive and increasing (

positive) and also when the velocity is negative and decreasing (

tive). In other words, the particle speeds up when the velocity and acceleration have the
same sign. (The particle is pushed in the same direction it is moving.) From Figure 3 we

EXAMPLE 2 If a rod or piece of wire is homogeneous, then its linear density is uniform
and is deﬁned as the mass per unit length 
and measured in kilograms per
meter. Suppose, however, that the rod is not homogeneous but that its mass measured
from its left end to a point is 
, as shown in Figure 5.
The mass of the part of the rod that lies between 
and 
is given by
, so the average density of that part of the rod is
If we now let 
(that is, 
), we are computing the average density over
smaller and smaller intervals. The linear density
at 
is the limit of these average
densities as 
; that is, the linear density is the rate of change of mass with respect
to length. Symbolically, 
Thus the linear density of the rod is the derivative of mass with respect to length.

EXAMPLE 3 A current exists whenever electric charges move. Figure 6 shows part of
a wire and electrons moving through a shaded plane surface. If 
is the net charge that
passes through this surface during a time period 
, then the average current during this
time interval is deﬁned as
If we take the limit of this average current over smaller and smaller time intervals, we
get what is called the current
at a given time :
Thus the current is the rate at which charge ﬂows through a surface. It is measured in
units of charge per unit time (often coulombs per second, called amperes).
M
Velocity, density, and current are not the only rates of change that are important in
physics. Others include power (the rate at which work is done), the rate of heat ﬂow, tem-
perature gradient (the rate of change of temperature with respect to position), and the rate
of decay of a radioactive substance in nuclear physics.
CHEMISTRY
EXAMPLE 4 A chemical reaction results in the formation of one or more substances
(called products) from one or more starting materials (called reactants). For instance, the
“equation”
indicates that two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen form two mole-
cules of water. Let’s consider the reaction
where A and B are the reactants and C is the product. The concentration of a reactant A
is the number of moles (
6.022
10
molecules) per liter and is denoted by

time 
. The average rate of reaction of the product C over a time interval 
is
But chemists are more interested in the instantaneous rate of reaction, which is
obtained by taking the limit of the average rate of reaction as the time interval 
approaches 0:
Since the concentration of the product increases as the reaction proceeds, the derivative
will be positive, and so the rate of reaction of C is positive. The concentrations
of the reactants, however, decrease during the reaction, so, to make the rates of reaction
of A and B positive numbers, we put minus signs in front of the derivatives 
and
. Since A and B each decrease at the same rate that C increases, we have
More generally, it turns out that for a reaction of the form
we have
The rate of reaction can be determined from data and graphical methods. In some cases
there are explicit formulas for the concentrations as functions of time, which enable us to
compute the rate of reaction (see Exercise 22).
M
EXAMPLE 5 One of the quantities of interest in thermodynamics is compressibility. If a
given substance is kept at a constant temperature, then its volume 
depends on its pres-
sure . We can consider the rate of change of volume with respect to pressure—namely,
the derivative 
. As 
increases, 
decreases, so 
. The compressibility
is deﬁned by introducing a minus sign and dividing this derivative by the volume :
Thus 
measures how fast, per unit volume, the volume of a substance decreases as the
pressure on it increases at constant temperature.
For instance, the volume 
(in cubic meters) of a sample of air at 
was found to
be related to the pressure 
(in kilopascals) by the equation

EXAMPLE 6 Let 
be the number of individuals in an animal or plant popula-
tion at time . The change in the population size between the times 
and 
is
, and so the average rate of growth during the time period 
is
The instantaneous rate of growth is obtained from this average rate of growth by let-
ting the time period 
approach 0:
Strictly speaking, this is not quite accurate because the actual graph of a population
function 
would be a step function that is discontinuous whenever a birth or
death occurs and therefore not differentiable. However, for a large animal or plant 
population, we can replace the graph by a smooth approximating curve as in Figure 7.

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES

To be more speciﬁc, consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient
medium. Suppose that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined
that the population doubles every hour. If the initial population is 
and the time is
measured in hours, then
and, in general,
The population function is 
.
In Section 3.4 we showed that
So the rate of growth of the bacteria population at time t is
For example, suppose that we start with an initial population of 
bacteria. Then
the rate of growth after 4 hours is
This means that, after 4 hours, the bacteria population is growing at a rate of about
1109 bacteria per hour.

EXAMPLE 7 When we consider the ﬂow of blood through a blood vessel, such as a vein
or artery, we can model the shape of the blood vessel by a cylindrical tube with radius 
and length as illustrated in Figure 8.
Because of friction at the walls of the tube, the velocity of the blood is greatest
along the central axis of the tube and decreases as the distance from the axis increases
until becomes 0 at the wall. The relationship between and is given by the law of
laminar ﬂow discovered by the French physician Jean-Louis-Marie Poiseuille in 1840.
This law states that
where 
is the viscosity of the blood and 
is the pressure difference between the ends
of the tube. If 
and are constant, then is a function of with domain

The average rate of change of the velocity as we move from

change of velocity with respect to r:
Using Equation 1, we obtain

At

To get a feeling for what this statement means, let’s change our units from centi-
meters to micrometers (
,m). Then the radius of the artery is 
,m. The
velocity at the central axis is 
,m#s, which decreases to 
,m#s at a distance
of 
,m. The fact that

velocity is decreasing at a rate of about 
,m#s for each micrometer that we proceed
away from the center.

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES

with respect to the number of items produced, is called the marginal cost by economists:
[Since often takes on only integer values, it may not make literal sense to let 
approach 0, but we can always replace 
by a smooth approximating function as in
Example 6.]
Taking 
and large (so that 
is small compared to ), we have
Thus the marginal cost of producing units is approximately equal to the cost of pro-
ducing one more unit [the 
st unit].
It is often appropriate to represent a total cost function by a polynomial
where represents the overhead cost (rent, heat, maintenance) and the other terms 
represent the cost of raw materials, labor, and so on. (The cost of raw materials may be
proportional to , but labor costs might depend partly on higher powers of because of
overtime costs and inefﬁciencies involved in large-scale operations.)
For instance, suppose a company has estimated that the cost (in dollars) of producing
items is
Then the marginal cost function is
The marginal cost at the production level of 500 items is
This gives the rate at which costs are increasing with respect to the production level
when 
and predicts the cost of the 501st item.
The actual cost of producing the 501st item is

Economists also study marginal demand, marginal revenue, and marginal proﬁt, which
are the derivatives of the demand, revenue, and proﬁt functions. These will be considered
in Chapter 4 after we have developed techniques for ﬁnding the maximum and minimum
values of functions.

urban geographer is interested in the rate of change of the population density in a city as
the distance from the city center increases. A meteorologist is concerned with the rate of
change of atmospheric pressure with respect to height (see Exercise 17 in Section 3.8).
In psychology, those interested in learning theory study the so-called learning curve,
which graphs the performance 
of someone learning a skill as a function of the train-
ing time . Of particular interest is the rate at which performance improves as time passes,
that is, 
.
In sociology, differential calculus is used in analyzing the spread of rumors (or innova-
tions or fads or fashions). If 
denotes the proportion of a population that knows a rumor
by time , then the derivative 
represents the rate of spread of the rumor (see Exer-
cise 82 in Section 3.4).
A SINGLE IDEA, MANY INTERPRETATIONS
Velocity, density, current, power, and temperature gradient in physics; rate of reaction and
compressibility in chemistry; rate of growth and blood velocity gradient in biology; mar-
ginal cost and marginal proﬁt in economics; rate of heat ﬂow in geology; rate of improve-
ment of performance in psychology; rate of spread of a rumor in sociology—these are all
special cases of a single mathematical concept, the derivative.
This is an illustration of the fact that part of the power of mathematics lies in its
abstractness. A single abstract mathematical concept (such as the derivative) can have dif-
ferent interpretations in each of the sciences. When we develop the properties of the math-
ematical concept once and for all, we can then turn around and apply these results to all of
the sciences. This is much more efﬁcient than developing properties of special concepts in
each separate science. The French mathematician Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) put it suc-
cinctly: “Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret
analogies that unite them.”

EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND DECAY
In many natural phenomena, quantities grow or decay at a rate proportional to their size.
For instance, if 
is the number of individuals in a population of animals or bacte-
ria at time , then it seems reasonable to expect that the rate of growth 
is proportion-
al to the population 
; that is, 
for some constant . Indeed, under ideal
conditions (unlimited environment, adequate nutrition, immunity to disease) the mathe-
matical model given by the equation 
predicts what actually happens fairly
accurately. Another example occurs in nuclear physics where the mass of a radioactive
substance decays at a rate proportional to the mass. In chemistry, the rate of a unimolecu-
lar ﬁrst-order reaction is proportional to the concentration of the substance. In ﬁnance, the

value of a savings account with continuously compounded interest increases at a rate pro-
portional to that value.
In general, if 
is the value of a quantity at time and if the rate of change of with
respect to is proportional to its size 
at any time, then
where
is a constant. Equation 1 is sometimes called the law of natural growth (if 
)
or the law of natural decay (if 
). It is called a differential equation because it
involves an unknown function and its derivative 
. 
It’s not hard to think of a solution of Equation 1. This equation asks us to ﬁnd a function
whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself. We have met such functions in this chap-
ter. Any exponential function of the form 
, where 
is a constant, satisﬁes
We will see in Section 9.4 that any function that satsiﬁes 
must be of the form
. To see the signiﬁcance of the constant , we observe that
Therefore 
is the initial value of the function.
THEOREM The only solutions of the differential equation 
are the
exponential functions
POPULATION GROWTH
What is the signiﬁcance of the proportionality constant k? In the context of population
growth, where 
is the size of a population at time , we can write
The quantity
is the growth rate divided by the population size; it is called the relative growth rate.
According to (3), instead of saying “the growth rate is proportional to population size” we
could say “the relative growth rate is constant.” Then (2) says that a population with con-
stant relative growth rate must grow exponentially. Notice that the relative growth rate k
appears as the coefﬁcient of t in the exponential function 
. For instance, if
and t is measured in years, then the relative growth rate is

EXAMPLE 1 Use the fact that the world population was 2560 million in 1950 and
3040 million in 1960 to model the population of the world in the second half of the 20th
century. (Assume that the growth rate is proportional to the population size.) What is the
relative growth rate? Use the model to estimate the world population in 1993 and to
predict the population in the year 2020.
SOLUTION We measure the time t in years and let t ! 0 in the year 1950. We measure the
population 
in millions of people. Then 
and 
Since we
are assuming that

The graph in Figure 1 shows that the model is fairly accurate to the end of the 20th cen-
tury (the dots represent the actual population), so the estimate for 1993 is quite reliable.
But the prediction for 2020 is riskier.

is negative, the relative decay
rate is positive.) It follows that
where k is a negative constant. In other words, radioactive substances decay at a rate pro-
portional to the remaining mass. This means that we can use (2) to show that the mass
decays exponentially:
Physicists express the rate of decay in terms of half-life, the time required for half of
any given quantity to decay.

(a) A sample of radium-226 has a mass of 100 mg. Find a formula for the mass of the
sample that remains after years.

SOLUTION
(a) Let 
be the mass of radium-226 (in milligrams) that remains after years. Then

NEWTON’S LAW OF COOLING
Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to
the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings, provided that this
difference is not too large. (This law also applies to warming.) If we let 
be the tem-
perature of the object at time and 
be the temperature of the surroundings, then we
can formulate Newton’s Law of Cooling as a differential equation:
where 
is a constant. This equation is not quite the same as Equation 1, so we  make
the change of variable 
. Because 
is constant, we have 
and so the equation becomes
We can then use (2) to find an expression for , from which we can find .

F) is placed in a refrigerator

be the temperature of the soda after minutes. The surrounding temperature

CONTINUOUSLY COMPOUNDED INTEREST
EXAMPLE 4 If $1000 is invested at 6% interest, compounded annually, then after 
1 year the investment is worth 
, after 2 years it’s worth
, and after years it’s worth 
. In general, if
an amount 
is invested at an interest rate 
in this example), then after 
years it’s worth 
. Usually, however, interest is compounded more frequently,
say, times a year. Then in each compounding period the interest rate is 
and there
are 
compounding periods in years, so the value of the investment is

You can see that the interest paid increases as the number of compounding periods 
increases. If we let 
, then we will be compounding the interest continuously and
the value of the investment will be
(where 
)
But the limit in this expression is equal to the number e. (See Equation 3.6.6). So with
continuous compounding of interest at interest rate r, the amount after t years is
If we differentiate this function, we get
which says that, with continuous compounding of interest, the rate of increase of an
investment is proportional to its size.
Returning to the example of $1000 invested for 3 years at 6% interest, we see that
with continuous compounding of interest the value of the investment will be
Notice how close this is to the amount we calculated for daily compounding, $1197.20.
But the amount is easier to compute if we use continuous compounding.

atmosphere and animal life assimilates C through food
chains. When a plant or animal dies, it stops replacing its 
carbon and the amount of C begins to decrease through
radioactive decay. Therefore the level of radioactivity 
must also decay exponentially.

If we are pumping air into a balloon, both the volume and the radius of the balloon are
increasing and their rates of increase are related to each other. But it is much easier to
measure directly the rate of increase of the volume than the rate of increase of the radius.
In a related rates problem the idea is to compute the rate of change of one quantity in
terms of the rate of change of another quantity (which may be more easily measured). The
procedure is to ﬁnd an equation that relates the two quantities and then use the Chain Rule
to differentiate both sides with respect to time.
EXAMPLE 1 Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases
at a rate of 
. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the diameter
is 50 cm?
SOLUTION We start by identifying two things:
the given information:
the rate of increase of the volume of air is 
and the unknown:
the rate of increase of the radius when the diameter is 50 cm
In order to express these quantities mathematically, we introduce some suggestive
notation:
Let V be the volume of the balloon and let r be its radius.
The key thing to remember is that rates of change are derivatives. In this problem, the
volume and the radius are both functions of the time . The rate of increase of the vol-
ume with respect to time is the derivative 
, and the rate of increase of the radius is
. We can therefore restate the given and the unknown as follows:

N According to the Principles of Problem Solving
discussed on page 76, the ﬁrst step is to under-
stand the problem. This includes reading the
problem carefully, identifying the given and the
unknown, and introducing suitable notation.

In order to connect 
and 
, we ﬁrst relate 
and by the formula for the
volume of a sphere:
In order to use the given information, we differentiate each side of this equation with
respect to . To differentiate the right side, we need to use the Chain Rule:
Now we solve for the unknown quantity:
If we put 
and 
in this equation, we obtain
The radius of the balloon is increasing at the rate of 
cm!s.

EXAMPLE 2 A ladder 10 ft long rests against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the ladder
slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 ft!s, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding
down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the wall? 
SOLUTION We ﬁrst draw a diagram and label it as in Figure 1. Let feet be the distance
from the bottom of the ladder to the wall and feet the distance from the top of the lad-
der to the ground. Note that and are both functions of (time, measured in seconds).
We are given that

Theorem:
Differentiating each side with respect to using the Chain Rule, we have
and solving this equation for the desired rate, we obtain
When 
, the Pythagorean Theorem gives 
and so, substituting these values and
, we have
The fact that 
is negative means that the distance from the top of the ladder to
the ground is decreasing at a rate of

down the wall at a rate of

and height 4 m. If water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 2 m !min, ﬁnd the rate

STRATEGY It is useful to recall some of the problem-solving principles from page 76
and adapt them to related rates in light of our experience in Examples 1–3:
1. Read the problem carefully.
2. Draw a diagram if possible.
3. Introduce notation. Assign symbols to all quantities that are functions of time.
4. Express the given information and the required rate in terms of derivatives.
5. Write an equation that relates the various quantities of the problem. If necessary, use
the geometry of the situation to eliminate one of the variables by substitution (as in
Example 3).
6. Use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to .
7. Substitute the given information into the resulting equation and solve for the 
unknown rate.
The following examples are further illustrations of the strategy.

A common error is to sub-
stitute the given numerical information (for
quantities that vary with time) too early. This
should be done only after the differentiation.
(Step 7 follows Step 6.) For instance, in Example
3 we dealt with general values of until we
ﬁnally substituted

LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS AND DIFFERENTIALS
We have seen that a curve lies very close to its tangent line near the point of tangency. In
fact, by zooming in toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, we noticed
that the graph looks more and more like its tangent line. (See Figure 2 in Section 2.7.) This
observation is the basis for a method of ﬁnding approximate values of functions.
The idea is that it might be easy to calculate a value 
of a function, but difﬁcult (or
even impossible) to compute nearby values of f. So we settle for the easily computed val-
ues of the linear function L whose graph is the tangent line of f at 
. (See Figure 1.)
In other words, we use the tangent line at 
as an approximation to the curve
when x is near a. An equation of this tangent line is
and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or tangent line approximation of f at a. The linear

and use it
to approximate the numbers 
and 
. Are these approximations overestimates
or underestimates?
SOLUTION The derivative of 
is
and so we have 
and 
. Putting these values into Equation 2, we see that
the linearization is
The corresponding linear approximation (1) is
(when is near )
In particular, we have
The linear approximation is illustrated in Figure 2. We see that, indeed, the tangent
line approximation is a good approximation to the given function when is near l. We
also see that our approximations are overestimates because the tangent line lies above the
curve.
Of course, a calculator could give us approximations for 
and 
, but the 
linear approximation gives an approximation over an entire interval.
M
In the following table we compare the estimates from the linear approximation in
Example 1 with the true values. Notice from this table, and also from Figure 2, that the tan-
gent line approximation gives good estimates when x is close to 1 but the accuracy of the
approximation deteriorates when x is farther away from 1.

How good is the approximation that we obtained in Example 1? The next example
shows that by using a graphing calculator or computer we can determine an interval through-
out which a linear approximation provides a speciﬁed accuracy.
EXAMPLE 2 For what values of is the linear approximation
accurate to within 0.5? What about accuracy to within 0.1?
SOLUTION Accuracy to within 0.5 means that the functions should differ by less than 0.5: 
Equivalently, we could write
This says that the linear approximation should lie between the curves obtained by shift-
ing the curve 
upward and downward by an amount 0.5. Figure 3 shows 
the tangent line 
intersecting the upper curve
at 
and . Zooming in and using the cursor, we estimate that the -coordinate of 
is about 
and the -coordinate of 
is about 8.66. Thus we see from the graph that the
approximation
is accurate to within 0.5 when 
. (We have rounded to be safe.)
Similarly, from Figure 4 we see that the approximation is accurate to within 0.1 when
.

APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS
Linear approximations are often used in physics. In analyzing the consequences of an
equation, a physicist sometimes needs to simplify a function by replacing it with its linear
approximation. For instance, in deriving a formula for the period of a pendulum, physics
textbooks obtain the expression 
for tangential acceleration and then replace
by
with the remark that 
is very close to 
if 
is not too large. [See, for exam-
ple, Physics: Calculus, 2d ed., by Eugene Hecht (Paciﬁc Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 2000),
p. 431.] You can verify that the linearization of the function 
at a ! 0 is
and so the linear approximation at 0 is
(see Exercise 42). So, in effect, the derivation of the formula for the period of a pendulum
uses the tangent line approximation for the sine function.
Another example occurs in the theory of optics, where light rays that arrive at shallow
angles relative to the optical axis are called paraxial rays. In paraxial (or Gaussian) optics,
both 
and 
are replaced by their linearizations. In other words, the linear approx-
imations

is close to 0. The results of calculations made with these approxi-
mations became the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses. [See Optics, 4th ed., by
Eugene Hecht (San Francisco: Addison-Wesley, 2002), p. 154.]
In Section 11.11 we will present several other applications of the idea of linear approx-
imations to physics.
DIFFERENTIALS
The ideas behind linear approximations are sometimes formulated in the terminology and
notation of differentials. If 
, where 
is a differentiable function, then the differ-
ential
is an independent variable; that is, 
can be given the value of any real number.
The differential
is then deﬁned in terms of 
by the equation
So 
is a dependent variable; it depends on the values of 
and 
. If 
is given a spe-
ciﬁc value and is taken to be some speciﬁc number in the domain of , then the numer-
ical value of 
is determined.
The geometric meaning of differentials is shown in Figure 5. Let 
and
be points on the graph of 
and let 
. The corresponding
change in is
The slope of the tangent line 
is the derivative 
. Thus the directed distance from S
to R is 
. Therefore 
represents the amount that the tangent line rises or falls
(the change in the linearization), whereas 
represents the amount that the curve 
rises or falls when changes by an amount 
.

Notice that the approximation 
becomes better as 
becomes smaller in
Example 3. Notice also that 
was easier to compute than 
. For more complicated func-
tions it may be impossible to compute 
exactly. In such cases the approximation by dif-
ferentials is especially useful.
In the notation of differentials, the linear approximation (1) can be written as
For instance, for the function 
in Example 1, we have
If a ! 1 and 
, then
and
just as we found in Example 1.
Our ﬁnal example illustrates the use of differentials in estimating the errors that occur
because of approximate measurements.
EXAMPLE 4 The radius of a sphere was measured and found to be 21 cm with a pos-
sible error in measurement of at most 0.05 cm. What is the maximum error in using this
value of the radius to compute the volume of the sphere?
SOLUTION If the radius of the sphere is , then its volume is 
. If the error in the
measured value of is denoted by 
, then the corresponding error in the calcu-
lated value of 
is 
, which can be approximated by the differential
When 
and 
, this becomes
The maximum error in the calculated volume is about 277 cm .
M
Although the possible error in Example 4 may appear to be rather large, a bet-
ter picture of the error is given by the relative error, which is computed by dividing the
error by the total volume:
Thus the relative error in the volume is about three times the relative error in the radius. 
In Example 4 the relative error in the radius is approximately 
and it produces a relative error of about 0.007 in the volume. The errors could also be
expressed as percentage errors of 
in the radius and 
in the volume.

approximation is a good one, we stipulate the following:

HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
Certain even and odd combinations of the exponential functions 
and 
arise so fre-
quently in mathematics and its applications that they deserve to be given special names. 
In many ways they are analogous to the trigonometric functions, and they have the same
relationship to the hyperbola that the trigonometric functions have to the circle. For this
reason they are collectively called hyperbolic functions and individually called hyperbolic
sine, hyperbolic cosine, and so on.

The graphs of hyperbolic sine and cosine can be sketched using graphical addition as
in Figures 1 and 2.
Note that

and range , while 
has domain 
and range 
.
The graph of 
is shown in Figure 3. It has the horizontal asymptotes 
. (See
Exercise 23.)
Some of the mathematical uses of hyperbolic functions will be seen in Chapter 7.
Applications to science and engineering occur whenever an entity such as light, velocity,
electricity, or radioactivity is gradually absorbed or extinguished, for the decay can be rep-
resented by hyperbolic functions. The most famous application is the use of hyperbolic
cosine to describe the shape of a hanging wire. It can be proved that if a heavy ﬂexible
cable (such as a telephone or power line) is suspended between two points at the same
height, then it takes the shape of a curve with equation 
called a cate-
nary (see Figure 4). (The Latin word catena means “chain.”)
Another application of hyperbolic functions occurs in the description of ocean waves:
The velocity of a water wave with length 
moving across a body of water with depth is
modeled by the function
where is the acceleration due to gravity. (See Figure 5 and Exercise 49.)
The hyperbolic functions satisfy a number of identities that are similar to well-known
trigonometric identities. We list some of them here and leave most of the proofs to the
exercises.

(b) We start with the identity proved in part (a):
If we divide both sides by 
, we get
or
M
The identity proved in Example 1(a) gives a clue to the reason for the name “hyper-
bolic” functions:
If is any real number, then the point 
lies on the unit circle 
because 
. In fact, can be interpreted as the radian measure of 
in Figure 6. For this reason the trigonometric functions are sometimes called circular
functions.
Likewise, if is any real number, then the point 
lies on the right branch
of the hyperbola 
because 
and 
. This time, 
does not represent the measure of an angle. However, it turns out that represents twice
the area of the shaded hyperbolic sector in Figure 7, just as in the trigonometric case rep-
resents twice the area of the shaded circular sector in Figure 6.
The derivatives of the hyperbolic functions are easily computed. For example,
We list the differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions as Table 1. The remaining
proofs are left as exercises. Note the analogy with the differentiation formulas for trigono-
metric functions, but beware that the signs are different in some cases.

INVERSE HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
You can see from Figures 1 and 3 that 
and 
are one-to-one functions and so they
have inverse functions denoted by 
and 
. Figure 2 shows that 
is not one-
to-one, but when restricted to the domain 
it becomes one-to-one. The inverse hyper-
bolic cosine function is deﬁned as the inverse of this restricted function.
The remaining inverse hyperbolic functions are deﬁned similarly (see Exercise 28).
We can sketch the graphs of 
, 
, and 
in Figures 8, 9, and 10 by using
Figures 1, 2, and 3.
Since the hyperbolic functions are deﬁned in terms of exponential functions, it’s not
surprising to learn that the inverse hyperbolic functions can be expressed in terms of log-
arithms. In particular, we have:

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES

Before you look at the example, cover up the solution and try it yourself ﬁrst.
EXAMPLE 1 How many lines are tangent to both of the parabolas 
and
? Find the coordinates of the points at which these tangents touch the 
parabolas.
SOLUTION To gain insight into this problem, it is essential to draw a diagram. So we sketch
the parabolas 
(which is the standard parabola 
shifted 1 unit upward)
and 
(which is obtained by reﬂecting the ﬁrst parabola about the x-axis). If
we try to draw a line tangent to both parabolas, we soon discover that there are only two
possibilities, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Let P be a point at which one of these tangents touches the upper parabola and let a
be its x-coordinate. (The choice of notation for the unknown is important. Of course we
could have used b or c or 
or 
instead of a. However, it’s not advisable to use x in
place of a because that x could be confused with the variable x in the equation of the
parabola.) Then, since P lies on the parabola 
, its y-coordinate must be 
Because of the symmetry shown in Figure 1, the coordinates of the point Q where the
tangent touches the lower parabola must be 
.
To use the given information that the line is a tangent, we equate the slope of the line
PQ to the slope of the tangent line at P. We have
If 
, then the slope of the tangent line at P is 
. Thus the condi-
tion that we need to use is that
Solving this equation, we get 
, so 
and 
. Therefore the
points are (1, 2) and ($1, $2). By symmetry, the two remaining points are ($1, 2) 
and (1, $2).
M
EXAMPLE 2 For what values of does the equation 
have exactly one 
solution?
SOLUTION One of the most important principles of problem solving is to draw a diagram,
even if the problem as stated doesn’t explicitly mention a geometric situation. Our pres-
ent problem can be reformulated geometrically as follows: For what values of does the
curve 
intersect the curve 
in exactly one point?
Let’s start by graphing 
and 
for various values of . We know that,
for 
, 
is a parabola that opens upward if 
and downward if 
.
Figure 2 shows the parabolas 
for several positive values of . Most of them
don’t intersect 
at all and one intersects twice. We have the feeling that there
must be a value of (somewhere between 
and 
) for which the curves intersect
exactly once, as in Figure 3.
To ﬁnd that particular value of , we let be the -coordinate of the single point of
intersection. In other words, 
, so is the unique solution of the given equa-
tion. We see from Figure 3 that the curves just touch, so they have a common tangent

have the same slope when
. Therefore
Solving the equations 
and 
, we get
Thus 
and
For negative values of we have the situation illustrated in Figure 4: All parabolas
with negative values of intersect 
exactly once. And let’s not forget
about 
: The curve 
is just the -axis, which intersects 
exactly
once.

We have already investigated some of the applications of derivatives, but now that we
know the differentiation rules we are in a better position to pursue the applications of
differentiation in greater depth. Here we learn how derivatives affect the shape of a
graph of a function and, in particular, how they help us locate maximum and minimum
values of functions. Many practical problems require us to minimize a cost or maximize
an area or somehow ﬁnd the best possible outcome of a situation. In particular, we will
be able to investigate the optimal shape of a can and to explain the location of rainbows
in the sky.
Calculus reveals all the important aspects of graphs of functions.

MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES
Some of the most important applications of differential calculus are optimization prob-
lems, in which we are required to ﬁnd the optimal (best) way of doing something. Here are
examples of such problems that we will solve in this chapter:
I What is the shape of a can that minimizes manufacturing costs?
I What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle? (This is an important 
question to the astronauts who have to withstand the effects of acceleration.)
I What is the radius of a contracted windpipe that expels air most rapidly during 
a cough?
I At what angle should blood vessels branch so as to minimize the energy expended
by the heart in pumping blood?
These problems can be reduced to ﬁnding the maximum or minimum values of a function.
Let’s ﬁrst explain exactly what we mean by maximum and minimum values.
DEFINITION A function 
has an absolute maximum (or global maximum)
at if 
for all in , where 
is the domain of . The number 
is
called the maximum value of 
on . Similarly, 
has an absolute minimum at 
if 
for all in 
and the number 
is called the minimum value of 
on . The maximum and minimum values of 
are called the extreme values of .
Figure 1 shows the graph of a function 
with absolute maximum at 
and absolute 
minimum at . Note that 
is the highest point on the graph and 
is the low-
est point. If we consider only values of 
near 
[for instance, if we restrict our attention
to the interval 
], then 
is the largest of those values of 
and is called a local
maximum value of . Likewise, 
is called a local minimum value of 
because
for near [in the interval 
, for instance]. The function also has a local
minimum at . In general, we have the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION A function 
has a local maximum (or relative maximum) at 
if 
when x is near c. [This means that 
for all in some
open interval containing c.] Similarly, 
has a local minimum at if 
when is near c.
EXAMPLE 1 The function 
takes on its (local and absolute) maximum value
of 1 inﬁnitely many times, since
for any integer
and
for
all . Likewise, 
is its minimum value, where is any integer.
M
EXAMPLE 2 If 
, then 
because 
for all . Therefore 
is the absolute (and local) minimum value of . This corresponds to the fact that the
origin is the lowest point on the parabola 
. (See Figure 2.) However, there is no
highest point on the parabola and so this function has no maximum value.
M
EXAMPLE 3 From the graph of the function 
, shown in Figure 3, we see that
this function has neither an absolute maximum value nor an absolute minimum value. In
fact, it has no local extreme values either.

EXAMPLE 4 The graph of the function
is shown in Figure 4. You can see that

absolute maximum is

because it occurs at an endpoint.) Also,

is both a local and an absolute minimum. Note that

maximum at

M
We have seen that some functions have extreme values, whereas others do not. The 
following theorem gives conditions under which a function is guaranteed to possess
extreme values.
THE EXTREME VALUE THEOREM If 
is continuous on a closed interval 
,
then
attains an absolute maximum value 
and an absolute minimum value
at some numbers and 
in 
.
The Extreme Value Theorem is illustrated in Figure 5. Note that an extreme value can
be taken on more than once. Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively very plau-
sible, it is difﬁcult to prove and so we omit the proof.
Figures 6 and 7 show that a function need not possess extreme values if either hypoth-
esis (continuity or closed interval) is omitted from the Extreme Value Theorem.
The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 6 is deﬁned on the closed interval [0, 2]
but has no maximum value. (Notice that the range of f is [0, 3). The function takes on val-
ues arbitrarily close to 3, but never actually attains the value 3.) This does not contradict
the Extreme Value Theorem because f is not continuous. [Nonetheless, a discontinuous
function could have maximum and minimum values. See Exercise 13(b).]

The function t shown in Figure 7 is continuous on the open interval (0, 2) but has nei-
ther a maximum nor a minimum value. [The range of t is 
. The function takes on
arbitrarily large values.] This does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem because the
interval (0, 2) is not closed.
The Extreme Value Theorem says that a continuous function on a closed interval has a
maximum value and a minimum value, but it does not tell us how to ﬁnd these extreme
values. We start by looking for local extreme values.
Figure 8 shows the graph of a function with a local maximum at and a local minimum
at . It appears that at the maximum and minimum points the tangent lines are horizontal
and therefore each has slope 0. We know that the derivative is the slope of the tangent line,
so it appears that 
and 
. The following theorem says that this is always
true for differentiable functions.
FERMAT’S THEOREM If 
has a local maximum or minimum at , and if 
exists, then 
.
PROOF
Suppose, for the sake of deﬁniteness, that
has a local maximum at c. Then,
according to Deﬁnition 2, 
if 
is sufﬁciently close to . This implies that if 
is sufﬁciently close to 0, with being positive or negative, then
and therefore
We can divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number. Thus, if 
and is
sufﬁciently small, we have
Taking the right-hand limit of both sides of this inequality (using Theorem 2.3.2), we get
But since 
exists, we have
and so we have shown that 
.
If 
, then the direction of the inequality (5) is reversed when we divide by :
So, taking the left-hand limit, we have

N Fermat’s Theorem is named after Pierre 
Fermat (1601–1665), a French lawyer who took
up mathematics as a hobby. Despite his amateur
status, Fermat was one of the two inventors of
analytic geometry (Descartes was the other). His
methods for ﬁnding tangents to curves and maxi-
mum and minimum values (before the invention
of limits and derivatives) made him a forerunner
of Newton in the creation of differential calculus.

We have shown that 
and also that 
. Since both of these inequalities
must be true, the only possibility is that 
.
We have proved Fermat’s Theorem for the case of a local maximum. The case of a
local minimum can be proved in a similar manner, or we could use Exercise 76 to
deduce it from the case we have just proved (see Exercise 77).
M
The following examples caution us against reading too much into Fermat’s Theorem.
We can’t expect to locate extreme values simply by setting 
and solving for .
EXAMPLE 5 If 
, then 
, so 
. But 
has no maximum or
minimum at 0, as you can see from its graph in Figure 9. (Or observe that 
for
but 
for 
.) The fact that 
simply means that the curve 
has a horizontal tangent at 
. Instead of having a maximum or minimum at 
,
the curve crosses its horizontal tangent there.
M
EXAMPLE 6 The function 
has its (local and absolute) minimum value at 0,
but that value can’t be found by setting 
because, as was shown in Example 5
in Section 2.8, 
does not exist. (See Figure 10.)
M
|
WARNING Examples 5 and 6 show that we must be careful when using Fermat’s 
Theorem. Example 5 demonstrates that even when 
there need not be a maximum
or minimum at . (In other words, the converse of Fermat’s Theorem is false in general.)
Furthermore, there may be an extreme value even when 
does not exist (as in 
Example 6).
Fermat’s Theorem does suggest that we should at least start looking for extreme values
of 
at the numbers 
where 
or where 
does not exist. Such numbers are
given a special name.
DEFINITION A critical number of a function 
is a number in the domain of
such that either 
or 
does not exist.
EXAMPLE 7 Find the critical numbers of 
.
SOLUTION The Product Rule gives
[The same result could be obtained by ﬁrst writing 
.] Therefore
if 
, that is, 
, and 
does not exist when 
. Thus the
critical numbers are
and .
M
In terms of critical numbers, Fermat’s Theorem can be rephrased as follows (compare
Deﬁnition 6 with Theorem 4):
If f has a local maximum or minimum at c, then c is a critical number of f.

To ﬁnd an absolute maximum or minimum of a continuous function on a closed interval,
we note that either it is local [in which case it occurs at a critical number by (7)] or it occurs
at an endpoint of the interval. Thus the following three-step procedure always works.
THE CLOSED INTERVAL METHOD To ﬁnd the absolute maximum and minimum
values of a continuous function 
on a closed interval 
:
1. Find the values of 
at the critical numbers of 
in 
.
2. Find the values of 
at the endpoints of the interval.
3. The largest of the values from Steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; 
the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.
EXAMPLE 8 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function
SOLUTION Since 
is continuous on 
, we can use the Closed Interval Method:
Since 
exists for all , the only critical numbers of 
occur when 
, that is,
or 
. Notice that each of these critical numbers lies in the interval 
.
The values of 
at these critical numbers are
The values of 
at the endpoints of the interval are
Comparing these four numbers, we see that the absolute maximum value is 
and the absolute minimum value is 
.
Note that in this example the absolute maximum occurs at an endpoint, whereas the
absolute minimum occurs at a critical number. The graph of 
is sketched in Figure 12.
M
If you have a graphing calculator or a computer with graphing software, it is possible
to estimate maximum and minimum values very easily. But, as the next example shows,
calculus is needed to ﬁnd the exact values.
EXAMPLE 9
(a) Use a graphing device to estimate the absolute minimum and maximum values of
the function 
.
(b) Use calculus to ﬁnd the exact minimum and maximum values.
SOLUTION
(a) Figure 13 shows a graph of 
in the viewing rectangle 
by 
. By mov-
ing the cursor close to the maximum point, we see that the -coordinates don’t change
very much in the vicinity of the maximum. The absolute maximum value is about 6.97
and it occurs when 
. Similarly, by moving the cursor close to the minimum point,
we see that the absolute minimum value is about 
and it occurs when 
. It is

EXAMPLE 10 The Hubble Space Telescope was deployed on April 24, 1990, by the space
shuttle Discovery. A model for the velocity of the shuttle during this mission, from liftoff
at 
until the solid rocket boosters were jettisoned at 
, is given by
(in feet per second). Using this model, estimate the absolute maximum and minimum
values of the acceleration of the shuttle between liftoff and the jettisoning of the boosters.
SOLUTION We are asked for the extreme values not of the given velocity function, but
rather of the acceleration function. So we ﬁrst need to differentiate to ﬁnd the acceleration:
We now apply the Closed Interval Method to the continuous function a on the interval
. Its derivative is
The only critical number occurs when 
:
Evaluating 
at the critical number and at the endpoints, we have
So the maximum acceleration is about

about

73. When a foreign object lodged in the trachea (windpipe) forces
a person to cough, the diaphragm thrusts upward causing an
increase in pressure in the lungs. This is accompanied by a
contraction of the trachea, making a narrower channel for the
expelled air to ﬂow through. For a given amount of air to
escape in a ﬁxed time, it must move faster through the
narrower channel than the wider one. The greater the velocity
of the airstream, the greater the force on the foreign object.
X rays show that the radius of the circular tracheal tube
contracts to about two-thirds of its normal radius during a
cough. According to a mathematical model of coughing, the
velocity of the airstream is related to the radius of the
trachea by the equation
where is a constant and 
is the normal radius of the trachea.
The restriction on is due to the fact that the tracheal wall stiff-
ens under pressure and a contraction greater than 
is
prevented (otherwise the person would suffocate).

Rainbows are created when raindrops scatter sunlight. They have fascinated mankind since
ancient times and have inspired attempts at scientiﬁc explanation since the time of Aristotle. In
this project we use the ideas of Descartes and Newton to explain the shape, location, and colors
of rainbows. 
1. The ﬁgure shows a ray of sunlight entering a spherical raindrop at . Some of the light is
reﬂected, but the line 
shows the path of the part that enters the drop. Notice that the light
is refracted toward the normal line 
and in fact Snell’s Law says that 
,
where 
is the angle of incidence, 
is the angle of refraction, and 
is the index of
refraction for water. At 
some of the light passes through the drop and is refracted into the
air, but the line 
shows the part that is reﬂected. (The angle of incidence equals the angle
of reﬂection.) When the ray reaches , part of it is reﬂected, but for the time being we are
more interested in the part that leaves the raindrop at . (Notice that it is refracted away
from the normal line.) The angle of deviation
is the amount of clockwise rotation that
the ray has undergone during this three-stage process. Thus
Show that the minimum value of the deviation is 
and occurs when 
.
The signiﬁcance of the minimum deviation is that when 
we have 
, so
. This means that many rays with 
become deviated by approximately
the same amount. It is the concentration of rays coming from near the direction of minimum
deviation that creates the brightness of the primary rainbow. The ﬁgure at the left shows 
that the angle of elevation from the observer up to the highest point on the rainbow is
. (This angle is called the rainbow angle.)
2. Problem 1 explains the location of the primary rainbow, but how do we explain the colors?

green, blue, indigo, and violet. As Newton discovered in his prism experiments of 1666, the
index of refraction is different for each color. (The effect is called dispersion.) For red light
the refractive index is 
whereas for violet light it is 
. By repeating the
calculation of Problem 1 for these values of , show that the rainbow angle is about 
for
the red bow and 
for the violet bow. So the rainbow really consists of seven individual
bows corresponding to the seven colors.
3. Perhaps you have seen a fainter secondary rainbow above the primary bow. That results from
the part of a ray that enters a raindrop and is refracted at , reﬂected twice (at 
and ), and
refracted as it leaves the drop at 
(see the ﬁgure). This time the deviation angle 
is the
total amount of counterclockwise rotation that the ray undergoes in this four-stage process.
Show that

Taking

and so the rainbow angle for
the secondary rainbow is about

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM
We will see that many of the results of this chapter depend on one central fact, which is
called the Mean Value Theorem. But to arrive at the Mean Value Theorem we ﬁrst need the
following result.
ROLLE’S THEOREM Let 
be a function that satisﬁes the following three hypotheses:
1.
is continuous on the closed interval 
.
2.
is differentiable on the open interval 
.

N Rolle’s Theorem was ﬁrst published in 
1691 by the French mathematician Michel Rolle
(1652–1719) in a book entitled Méthode pour
résoudre les égalitéz. He was a vocal critic of the
methods of his day and attacked calculus as
being a “collection of ingenious fallacies.” Later,
however, he became convinced of the essential
correctness of the methods of calculus.

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION

Before giving the proof let’s take a look at the graphs of some typical functions that sat-
isfy the three hypotheses. Figure 1 shows the graphs of four such functions. In each case
it appears that there is at least one point 
on the graph where the tangent is hori-
zontal and therefore 
. Thus Rolle’s Theorem is plausible.
PROOF
There are three cases:
CASE I
N
, a constant
Then 
, so the number can be taken to be any number in 
.
CASE II
N
for some x in 
[as in Figure 1(b) or (c)]
By the Extreme Value Theorem (which we can apply by hypothesis 1), 
has a maxi-
mum value somewhere in 
. Since 
, it must attain this maximum value at
a number in the open interval 
. Then 
has a local maximum at and, by hypoth-
esis 2, 
is differentiable at . Therefore 
by Fermat’s Theorem.
CASE III
N
for some x in 
[as in Figure 1(c) or (d)]
By the Extreme Value Theorem, 
has a minimum value in 
and, since 
, 
it attains this minimum value at a number in 
. Again 
by Fermat’s
Theorem.
M
EXAMPLE 1 Let’s apply Rolle’s Theorem to the position function 
of a moving
object. If the object is in the same place at two different instants 
and 
, then
. Rolle’s Theorem says that there is some instant of time 
between and
when 
; that is, the velocity is 0. (In particular, you can see that this is true
when a ball is thrown directly upward.)
M
EXAMPLE 2 Prove that the equation 
has exactly one real root.
SOLUTION First we use the Intermediate Value Theorem (2.5.10) to show that a root exists.
Let 
. Then 
and 
. Since 
is a polynomi-
al, it is continuous, so the Intermediate Value Theorem states that there is a number 
between 0 and 1 such that 
. Thus the given equation has a root.
To show that the equation has no other real root, we use Rolle’s Theorem and argue by
contradiction. Suppose that it had two roots and . Then 
and, since 
is a polynomial, it is differentiable on 
and continuous on 
. Thus, by Rolle’s
Theorem, there is a number between and such that 
. But
(since 
) so 
can never be 0. This gives a contradiction. Therefore the equation
can’t have two real roots.

Our main use of Rolle’s Theorem is in proving the following important theorem, which
was ﬁrst stated by another French mathematician, Joseph-Louis Lagrange.
THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM Let 
be a function that satisﬁes the following
hypotheses:
1.
is continuous on the closed interval 
.
2.
is differentiable on the open interval 
.
Then there is a number in 
such that
or, equivalently,
Before proving this theorem, we can see that it is reasonable by interpreting it geomet-
rically. Figures 3 and 4 show the points 
and 
on the graphs of two dif-
ferentiable functions. The slope of the secant line 
is
which is the same expression as on the right side of Equation 1. Since 
is the slope of
the tangent line at the point 
, the Mean Value Theorem, in the form given by Equa-
tion 1, says that there is at least one point 
on the graph where the slope of the
tangent line is the same as the slope of the secant line 
. In other words, there is a point
where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line 
.
PROOF
We apply Rolle’s Theorem to a new function deﬁned as the difference between
and the function whose graph is the secant line 
. Using Equation 3, we see that the
equation of the line 
can be written as

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
N The Mean Value Theorem is an example of
what is called an existence theorem. Like the
Intermediate Value Theorem, the Extreme Value
Theorem, and Rolle’s Theorem, it guarantees that
there exists a number with a certain property,
but it doesn’t tell us how to ﬁnd the number.

So, as shown in Figure 5,
First we must verify that satisﬁes the three hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem.
1. The function is continuous on 
because it is the sum of and a ﬁrst-degree
polynomial, both of which are continuous.
2. The function is differentiable on 
because both and the ﬁrst-degree poly-
nomial are differentiable. In fact, we can compute 
directly from Equation 4:
(Note that 
and 
are constants.)
3.
Therefore, 
.
Since satisﬁes the hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem, that theorem says there is a num-
ber in 
such that 
. Therefore
and so
M
EXAMPLE 3 To illustrate the Mean Value Theorem with a speciﬁc function, let’s con-
sider 
. Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous and differ-
entiable for all , so it is certainly continuous on 
and differentiable on 
.
Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number in 
such that
Now 
, and

. But

The Mean Value Theorem was ﬁrst formulated by
Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813), born in Italy
of a French father and an Italian mother. He was a
child prodigy and became a professor in Turin at
the tender age of 19. Lagrange made great con-
tributions to number theory, theory of functions, 
theory of equations, and analytical and celestial
mechanics. In particular, he applied calculus to the
analysis of the stability of the solar system. At 
the invitation of Frederick the Great, he succeeded
Euler at the Berlin Academy and, when Frederick
died, Lagrange accepted King Louis XVI’s invitation
to Paris, where he was given apartments in the
Louvre and became a professor at the Ecole Poly-
technique. Despite all the trappings of luxury and
fame, he was a kind and quiet man, living only for
science.

and the velocity at 
is 
. Thus the Mean Value Theorem (in the form of Equa-
tion 1) tells us that at some time 
between and the instantaneous velocity 
is equal to that average velocity. For instance, if a car traveled 180 km in 2 hours, then
the speedometer must have read 90 km'h at least once.
In general, the Mean Value Theorem can be interpreted as saying that there is a num-
ber at which the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of change over
an interval.
M
The main signiﬁcance of the Mean Value Theorem is that it enables us to obtain infor-
mation about a function from information about its derivative. The next example provides
an instance of this principle.
EXAMPLE 5 Suppose that

SOLUTION We are given that

In particular, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem on the interval 
. There exists a
number such that
so
We are given that 
for all , so in particular we know that 
. Multiply-
ing both sides of this inequality by 2, we have 
, so
The largest possible value for

M
The Mean Value Theorem can be used to establish some of the basic facts of differen-
tial calculus. One of these basic facts is the following theorem. Others will be found in the
following sections.
THEOREM If

tiable on

ing the Mean Value Theorem to

Since 
for all , we have 
, and so Equation 6 becomes
Therefore 
has the same value at any two numbers 
and

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION

HOW DERIVATIVES AFFECT THE SHAPE OF A GRAPH
Many of the applications of calculus depend on our ability to deduce facts about a func-
tion f from information concerning its derivatives. Because 
represents the slope of
the curve 
at the point 
, it tells us the direction in which the curve proceeds
at each point. So it is reasonable to expect that information about 
will provide us with
information about 
.
WHAT DOES 
SAY ABOUT
?
To see how the derivative of
can tell us where a function is increasing or decreasing, look
at Figure 1. (Increasing functions and decreasing functions were deﬁned in Section 1.1.)
Between A and B and between C and D, the tangent lines have positive slope and so
. Between B and C, the tangent lines have negative slope and so 
. Thus
it appears that f increases when 
is positive and decreases when 
is negative. To
prove that this is always the case, we use the Mean Value Theorem.
INCREASING/DECREASING TEST
(a) If 
on an interval, then
is increasing on that interval.
(b) If 
on an interval, then
is decreasing on that interval.
PROOF
(a) Let 
and 
be any two numbers in the interval with 
. According to the deﬁ-
nition of an increasing function (page 20) we have to show that 
.
Because we are given that 
, we know that
is differentiable on 
. So,
by the Mean Value Theorem there is a number c between 
and 
such that
Now 
by assumption and 
because 
. Thus the right side of
Equation 1 is positive, and so
This shows that f is increasing.
Part (b) is proved similarly.
M
EXAMPLE 1 Find where the function 
is increasing and
where it is decreasing.
SOLUTION
To use the I'D Test we have to know where 
and where 
. This
depends on the signs of the three factors of 
, namely, 
, 
, and 
. We
divide the real line into intervals whose endpoints are the critical numbers 
, and 
and arrange our work in a chart. A plus sign indicates that the given expression is posi-
tive, and a minus sign indicates that it is negative. The last column of the chart gives the

ing on (0, 2). (It would also be true to say that f is decreasing on the closed interval
.)
The graph of f shown in Figure 2 conﬁrms the information in the chart.
M
Recall from Section 4.1 that if 
has a local maximum or minimum at , then must be
a critical number of 
(by Fermat’s Theorem), but not every critical number gives rise to a
maximum or a minimum. We therefore need a test that will tell us whether or not 
has a
local maximum or minimum at a critical number.
You can see from Figure 2 that 
is a local maximum value of 
because 
increases on 
and decreases on 
. Or, in terms of derivatives, 
for
and 
for 
. In other words, the sign of 
changes from
positive to negative at . This observation is the basis of the following test.
THE FIRST DERIVATIVE TEST Suppose that is a critical number of a continuous 
function .
(a) If 
changes from positive to negative at , then 
has a local maximum at .
(b) If 
changes from negative to positive at , then 
has a local minimum at .
(c) If 
does not change sign at (for example, if 
is positive on both sides of c
or negative on both sides), then 
has no local maximum or minimum at .
The First Derivative Test is a consequence of the I'D Test. In part (a), for instance, since
the sign of 
changes from positive to negative at c,
is increasing to the left of c and
decreasing to the right of c. It follows that
has a local maximum at c.
It is easy to remember the First Derivative Test by visualizing diagrams such as those
in Figure 3.

changes from neg-
ative to positive at #1, so 
is a local minimum value by the First Derivative
Test. Similarly, 
changes from negative to positive at 2, so

that there is a local maximum at

WHAT DOES 
SAY ABOUT
?
Figure 5 shows the graphs of two increasing functions on 
. Both graphs join point 
to point 
but they look different because they bend in different directions. How can we
distinguish between these two types of behavior? In Figure 6 tangents to these curves have
been drawn at several points. In (a) the curve lies above the tangents and 
is called con-
cave upward on 
. In (b) the curve lies below the tangents and 
is called concave
downward on 
.
DEFINITION If the graph of 
lies above all of its tangents on an interval , then it
is called concave upward on . If the graph of 
lies below all of its tangents on I,
it is called concave downward on .
Figure 7 shows the graph of a function that is concave upward (abbreviated CU) on the
intervals
,
, and
and concave downward (CD) on the intervals
,
,
and 
.
Let’s see how the second derivative helps determine the intervals of concavity. Looking
at Figure 6(a), you can see that, going from left to right, the slope of the tangent increases.

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION

This means that the derivative 
is an increasing function and therefore its derivative 
is positive. Likewise, in Figure 6(b) the slope of the tangent decreases from left to right,
so 
decreases and therefore 
is negative. This reasoning can be reversed and suggests
that the following theorem is true. A proof is given in Appendix F with the help of the
Mean Value Theorem.
CONCAVITY TEST
(a) If 
for all in , then the graph of 
is concave upward on .
(b) If 
for all in , then the graph of 
is concave downward on .
EXAMPLE 4 Figure 8 shows a population graph for Cyprian honeybees raised in an 
apiary. How does the rate of population increase change over time? When is this rate
highest? Over what intervals is P concave upward or concave downward?
SOLUTION By looking at the slope of the curve as t increases, we see that the rate of
increase of the population is initially very small, then gets larger until it reaches a maxi-
mum at about t ! 12 weeks, and decreases as the population begins to level off. As the
population approaches its maximum value of about 75,000 (called the carrying capac-
ity), the rate of increase,
, approaches 0. The curve appears to be concave upward on
(0, 12) and concave downward on (12, 18).
M
In Example 4, the population curve changed from concave upward to concave down-
ward at approximately the point (12, 38,000). This point is called an inﬂection point of the
curve. The signiﬁcance of this point is that the rate of population increase has its maximum
value there. In general, an inﬂection point is a point where a curve changes its direction of
concavity.
DEFINITION A point 
on a curve 
is called an inﬂection point if 
is
continuous there and the curve changes from concave upward to concave down-
ward or from concave downward to concave upward at .
For instance, in Figure 7,
, and 
are the points of inﬂection. Notice that if a
curve has a tangent at a point of inﬂection, then the curve crosses its tangent there.
In view of the Concavity Test, there is a point of inﬂection at any point where the sec-
ond derivative changes sign.

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch a possible graph of a function 
that satisﬁes the following 
conditions:
SOLUTION Condition (i) tells us that 
is increasing on 
and decreasing on 
.
Condition (ii) says that 
is concave upward on 
and 
, and concave down-
ward on 
. From condition (iii) we know that the graph of 
has two horizontal
asymptotes:
and 
.
We ﬁrst draw the horizontal asymptote 
as a dashed line (see Figure 9). We
then draw the graph of 
approaching this asymptote at the far left, increasing to its maxi-
mum point at 
and decreasing toward the x-axis at the far right. We also make sure
that the graph has inﬂection points when 
and 2. Notice that we made the curve
bend upward for 
and 
, and bend downward when x is between %2 and 2.
M
Another application of the second derivative is the following test for maximum and
minimum values. It is a consequence of the Concavity Test.
THE SECOND DERIVATIVE TEST Suppose 
is continuous near .
(a) If 
and 
, then 
has a local minimum at .
(b) If 
and 
, then 
has a local maximum at .
For instance, part (a) is true because 
near c and so
is concave upward near
c. This means that the graph of
lies above its horizontal tangent at c and so
has a local
minimum at c. (See Figure 10.)
EXAMPLE 6 Discuss the curve 
with respect to concavity, points of
inﬂection, and local maxima and minima. Use this information to sketch the curve.
SOLUTION If 
, then
To ﬁnd the critical numbers we set 
and obtain 
and 
. To use the
Second Derivative Test we evaluate 
at these critical numbers:
Since 
and 
,
is a local minimum. Since 
, the
Second Derivative Test gives no information about the critical number 0. But since
for 
and also for 
, the First Derivative Test tells us that 
does
not have a local maximum or minimum at 0. [In fact, the expression for 
shows that
f decreases to the left of 3 and increases to the right of 3.]

Since 
when 
or , we divide the real line into intervals with these
numbers as endpoints and complete the following chart.
The point 
is an inﬂection point since the curve changes from concave upward to
concave downward there. Also,
is an inﬂection point since the curve changes
from concave downward to concave upward there.
Using the local minimum, the intervals of concavity, and the inﬂection points, we
sketch the curve in Figure 11.
M
The Second Derivative Test is inconclusive when 
. In other words, at
such a point there might be a maximum, there might be a minimum, or there might be nei-
ther (as in Example 6). This test also fails when 
does not exist. In such cases the First
Derivative Test must be used. In fact, even when both tests apply, the First Derivative Test
is often the easier one to use.
EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION You can use the differentiation rules to check that the ﬁrst two derivatives are
Since 
when 
and 
does not exist when 
or 
, the critical
numbers are 
, and .
To ﬁnd the local extreme values we use the First Derivative Test. Since 
changes
from negative to positive at 0,
is a local minimum. Since 
changes from
positive to negative at 4,
is a local maximum. The sign of 
does not change
at 6, so there is no minimum or maximum there. (The Second Derivative Test could be
used at 4, but not at 0 or 6 since 
does not exist at either of these numbers.)
Looking at the expression for 
and noting that 
for all , we have
for 
and for 
and 
for 
. So 
is concave down-
ward on 
and 
and concave upward on 
, and the only inﬂection point
is 
. The graph is sketched in Figure 12. Note that the curve has vertical tangents at
and 
because 
as 
and as

M
EXAMPLE 8 Use the ﬁrst and second derivatives of 
, together with asymp-
totes, to sketch its graph.
SOLUTION Notice that the domain of 
is

by computing the left and right limits as 
. As

Now let’s compute the derivative. The Chain Rule gives

A drug response curve describes the level of medication in
the bloodstream after a drug is administered.  A surge func-
tion 
is often used to model the response
curve, reﬂecting an initial surge in the drug level and then a
more gradual decline.  If, for a particular drug,
, and is measured in minutes, estimate the
times corresponding to the inﬂection points and explain
their signiﬁcance.  If you have a graphing device, use it to
graph the drug response curve.
66. The family of bell-shaped curves
occurs in probability and statistics, where it is called the nor-
mal density function. The constant 
is called the mean and
the positive constant 
is called the standard deviation. For
simplicity, let’s scale the function so as to remove the factor
and let’s analyze the special case where

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
INDETERMINATE FORMS AND L’HOSPITAL’S RULE
Suppose we are trying to analyze the behavior of the function
Although 
is not deﬁned when 
, we need to know how 
behaves near 1. In partic-
ular, we would like to know the value of the limit
In computing this limit we can’t apply Law 5 of limits (the limit of a quotient is the quo-
tient of the limits, see Section 2.3) because the limit of the denominator is 0. In fact,
although the limit in (1) exists, its value is not obvious because both numerator and denom-
inator approach and is not deﬁned.
In general, if we have a limit of the form
where both 
and 
as 
, then this limit may or may not exist and is
called an indeterminate form of type . We met some limits of this type in Chapter 2. For

rational functions, we can cancel common factors:
We used a geometric argument to show that
But these methods do not work for limits such as (1), so in this section we introduce a sys-
tematic method, known as l’Hospital’s Rule, for the evaluation of indeterminate forms.
Another situation in which a limit is not obvious occurs when we look for a horizontal
asymptote of F and need to evaluate the limit
It isn’t obvious how to evaluate this limit because both numerator and denominator become
large as 
. There is a struggle between numerator and denominator. If the numerator
wins, the limit will be ; if the denominator wins, the answer will be 0. Or there may be
some compromise, in which case the answer may be some ﬁnite positive number.
In general, if we have a limit of the form
where both 
(or 
) and 
(or 
), then the limit may or may not exist
and is called an indeterminate form of type
. We saw in Section 2.6 that this type of
limit can be evaluated for certain functions, including rational functions, by dividing
numerator and denominator by the highest power of that occurs in the denominator. For
instance,
This method does not work for limits such as (2), but l’Hospital’s Rule also applies to this
type of indeterminate form.

interval that contains (except possibly at ). Suppose that

SECTION 4.4 INDETERMINATE FORMS AND L’HOSPITAL’S RULE
||||
299
L’Hospital’s Rule is named after a 
French nobleman, the Marquis de l’Hospital
(1661–1704), but was discovered by a Swiss 
mathematician, John Bernoulli (1667–1748). You
might sometimes see l’Hospital spelled as 
l’Hôpital, but he spelled his own name l’Hospital,
as was common in the 17th century. See Exer-
cise 77 for the example that the Marquis used to
illustrate his rule. See the project on page 307 
for further historical details.
L’HOSPITAL

L’Hospital’s Rule says that the limit of a quotient of functions is equal to the
limit of the quotient of their derivatives, provided that the given conditions are satisﬁed. It
is especially important to verify the conditions regarding the limits of and before using
l’Hospital’s Rule.
L’Hospital’s Rule is also valid for one-sided limits and for limits at inﬁnity or
negative inﬁnity; that is, “
” can be replaced by any of the symbols 
, 
,
, or 
.
For the special case in which 
,
and 
are continuous, and
, it is easy to see why l’Hospital’s Rule is true. In fact, using the alternative form
of the deﬁnition of a derivative, we have
It is more difﬁcult to prove the general version of l’Hospital’s Rule. See Appendix F.

The required limit is, in fact, easy to ﬁnd because the function is continuous at 
and
the denominator is nonzero there:

Example 5 shows what can go wrong if you use l’Hospital’s Rule without thinking.
Other limits can be found using l’Hospital’s Rule but are more easily found by other meth-
ods. (See Examples 3 and 5 in Section 2.3, Example 3 in Section 2.6, and the discussion
at the beginning of this section.) So when evaluating any limit, you should consider other
methods before using l’Hospital’s Rule.
INDETERMINATE PRODUCTS
If 
and 
(or 
), then it isn’t clear what the value of
, if any, will be. There is a struggle between and . If wins, the answer
will be ; if wins, the answer will be 
(or 
). Or there may be a compromise where
the answer is a ﬁnite nonzero number. This kind of limit is called an indeterminate form
of type 
. We can deal with it by writing the product 
as a quotient:
or
This converts the given limit into an indeterminate form of type or 
so that we can
use l’Hospital’s Rule.
EXAMPLE 6 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION The given limit is indeterminate because, as 
, the ﬁrst factor 
approaches 0 while the second factor 
approaches 
. Writing 
, we
have 
as 
, so l’Hospital’s Rule gives
M
In solving Example 6 another possible option would have been to write
This gives an indeterminate form of the type 
, but if we apply l’Hospital’s Rule we get
a more complicated expression than the one we started with. In general, when we rewrite
an indeterminate product, we try to choose the option that leads to the simpler limit.
INDETERMINATE DIFFERENCES
If 
and 
, then the limit
is called an indeterminate form of type
. Again there is a contest between and .
Will the answer be 
( wins) or will it be 
( wins) or will they compromise on a ﬁnite
number? To ﬁnd out, we try to convert the difference into a quotient (for instance, by using

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION

L’Hospital’s Rule was ﬁrst published in 1696 in the Marquis de l’Hospital’s calculus textbook
Analyse des Inﬁniment Petits, but the rule was discovered in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician
John (Johann) Bernoulli. The explanation is that these two mathematicians had entered into a
curious business arrangement whereby the Marquis de l’Hospital bought the rights to Bernoulli’s
mathematical discoveries. The details, including a translation of l’Hospital’s letter to Bernoulli
proposing the arrangement, can be found in the book by Eves [1].
Write a report on the historical and mathematical origins of l’Hospital’s Rule. Start by pro-
viding brief biographical details of both men (the dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is a good
source) and outline the business deal between them. Then give l’Hospital’s statement of his rule,
which is found in Struik’s sourcebook [4] and more brieﬂy in the book of Katz [3]. Notice that
l’Hospital and Bernoulli formulated the rule geometrically and gave the answer in terms of dif-
ferentials. Compare their statement with the version of l’Hospital’s Rule given in Section 4.4 and
show that the two statements are essentially the same.

SECTION 4.5 SUMMARY OF CURVE SKETCHING

307
SUMMARY OF CURVE SKETCHING
So far we have been concerned with some particular aspects of curve sketching: domain,
range, and symmetry in Chapter 1; limits, continuity, and asymptotes in Chapter 2; deriva-
tives and tangents in Chapters 2 and 3; and extreme values, intervals of increase and
decrease, concavity, points of inﬂection, and l’Hospital’s Rule in this chapter. It is now
time to put all of this information together to sketch graphs that reveal the important fea-
tures of functions.
You might ask: Why don’t we just use a graphing calculator or computer to graph a
curve? Why do we need to use calculus?
It’s true that modern technology is capable of producing very accurate graphs. But even
the best graphing devices have to be used intelligently. We saw in Section 1.4 that it is
extremely important to choose an appropriate viewing rectangle to avoid getting a mis-
leading graph. (See especially Examples 1, 3, 4, and 5 in that section.) The use of calculus
enables us to discover the most interesting aspects of graphs and in many cases to calcu-
late maximum and minimum points and inﬂection points exactly instead of approximately.
For instance, Figure 1 shows the graph of 
. At ﬁrst
glance it seems reasonable: It has the same shape as cubic curves like 
, and it
appears to have no maximum or minimum point. But if you compute the derivative, you
will see that there is a maximum when 
and a minimum when 
. Indeed, if
we zoom in to this portion of the graph, we see that behavior exhibited in Figure 2. Without
calculus, we could easily have overlooked it.
In the next section we will graph functions by using the interaction between calculus
and graphing devices. In this section we draw graphs by ﬁrst considering the following

information. We don’t assume that you have a graphing device, but if you do have one you
should use it as a check on your work.
GUIDELINES FOR SKETCHING A CURVE
The following checklist is intended as a guide to sketching a curve 
by hand. Not
every item is relevant to every function. (For instance, a given curve might not have an
asymptote or possess symmetry.) But the guidelines provide all the information you need
to make a sketch that displays the most important aspects of the function.
A. Domain It’s often useful to start by determining the domain 
of , that is, the set of
values of for which 
is deﬁned.
B. Intercepts The -intercept is 
and this tells us where the curve intersects the -axis.
To ﬁnd the -intercepts, we set 
and solve for . (You can omit this step if the
equation is difﬁcult to solve.)
C. Symmetry
(i) If 
for all 
in , that is, the equation of the curve is unchanged
when is replaced by 
, then 
is an even function and the curve is symmetric about
the -axis. This means that our work is cut in half. If we know what the curve looks like
for 
, then we need only reﬂect about the -axis to obtain the complete curve [see
Figure 3(a)]. Here are some examples: 
, and 
.
(ii) If 
for all 
in 
, then 
is an odd function and the curve is
symmetric about the origin. Again we can obtain the complete curve if we know what
it looks like for 
. [Rotate 180° about the origin; see Figure 3(b).] Some simple
examples of odd functions are 
, and 
.
(iii) If 
for all in , where is a positive constant, then is called
a periodic function and the smallest such number 
is called the period. For instance,
has period 
and 
has period . If we know what the graph looks
like in an interval of length , then we can use translation to sketch the entire graph (see
Figure 4).
D. Asymptotes
(i) Horizontal Asymptotes. Recall from Section 2.6 that if either 
or
, then the line 
is a horizontal asymptote of the curve 
.
If it turns out that 
(or 
), then we do not have an asymptote to the
right, but that is still useful information for sketching the curve.
(ii) Vertical Asymptotes. Recall from Section 2.2 that the line 
is a vertical
asymptote if at least one of the following statements is true:

(For rational functions you can locate the vertical asymptotes by equating the denomi-
nator to 0 after canceling any common factors. But for other functions this method does
not apply.) Furthermore, in sketching the curve it is very useful to know exactly which
of the statements in (1) is true. If 
is not deﬁned but is an endpoint of the domain
of , then you should compute 
or 
, whether or not this limit is
inﬁnite.
(iii) Slant Asymptotes. These are discussed at the end of this section.
E. Intervals of Increase or Decrease Use the I/D Test. Compute 
and ﬁnd the intervals 
on which 
is positive (
is increasing) and the intervals on which 
is negative
(
is decreasing).
F. Local Maximum and Minimum Values Find the critical numbers of 
[the numbers 
where 
or 
does not exist]. Then use the First Derivative Test. If 
changes from positive to negative at a critical number , then 
is a local maximum.
If 
changes from negative to positive at , then 
is a local minimum. Although it
is usually preferable to use the First Derivative Test, you can use the Second Derivative
Test if 
and 
. Then 
implies that 
is a local minimum,
whereas 
implies that 
is a local maximum.
G. Concavity and Points of Inﬂection Compute 
and use the Concavity Test. The curve
is concave upward where 
and concave downward where 
. Inﬂec-
tion points occur where the direction of concavity changes.
H. Sketch the Curve Using the information in items A–G, draw the graph. Sketch the
asymptotes as dashed lines. Plot the intercepts, maximum and minimum points, and
inﬂection points. Then make the curve pass through these points, rising and falling
according to E, with concavity according to G, and approaching the asymptotes. If addi-
tional accuracy is desired near any point, you can compute the value of the derivative
there. The tangent indicates the direction in which the curve proceeds.
EXAMPLE 1 Use the guidelines to sketch the curve 
.
A. The domain is
B. The - and -intercepts are both 0.
C. Since 
, the function 
is even. The curve is symmetric about the -axis.
D.
Therefore the line 
is a horizontal asymptote. 
Since the denominator is 0 when 
, we compute the following limits:
Therefore the lines 
and 
are vertical asymptotes. This information
about limits and asymptotes enables us to draw the preliminary sketch in Figure 5,
showing the parts of the curve near the asymptotes.

similar situation exists if we let

when the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator. In such
a case the equation of the slant asymptote can be found by long division as in the follow-

56. Coulomb’s Law states that the force of attraction between two
charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the
charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between them. The ﬁgure shows particles with charge 1 located
at positions 0 and 2 on a coordinate line and a particle with
charge 
at a position between them. It follows from Cou-
lomb’s Law that the net force acting on the middle particle is

GRAPHING WITH CALCULUS AND CALCULATORS
The method we used to sketch curves in the preceding section was a culmination of much
of our study of differential calculus. The graph was the ﬁnal object that we produced. In
this section our point of view is completely different. Here we start with a graph produced
by a graphing calculator or computer and then we reﬁne it. We use calculus to make sure
that we reveal all the important aspects of the curve. And with the use of graphing devices
we can tackle curves that would be far too complicated to consider without technology.
The theme is the interaction between calculus and calculators.
EXAMPLE 1 Graph the polynomial 
. Use the graphs of 
and 
to estimate all maximum and minimum points and intervals of concavity.
SOLUTION If we specify a domain but not a range, many graphing devices will deduce a
suitable range from the values computed. Figure 1 shows the plot from one such device
if we specify that 
. Although this viewing rectangle is useful for showing
that the asymptotic behavior (or end behavior) is the same as for 
, it is obviously
hiding some ﬁner detail. So we change to the viewing rectangle 
by 
shown in Figure 2.
From this graph it appears that there is an absolute minimum value of about 
3
when 
(by using the cursor) and 
is decreasing on 
and increas-
ing on 
. Also, there appears to be a horizontal tangent at the origin and inﬂec-
tion points when 
and when is somewhere between 
and 
.
Now let’s try to conﬁrm these impressions using calculus. We differentiate and get

N If you have not already read Section 1.4, you
should do so now. In particular, it explains how
to avoid some of the pitfalls of graphing devices
by choosing appropriate viewing rectangles.

When we graph 
in Figure 3 we see that 
changes from negative to positive when
; this conﬁrms (by the First Derivative Test) the minimum value that we
found earlier. But, perhaps to our surprise, we also notice that 
changes from posi-
tive to negative when 
and from negative to positive when 
. This means
that 
has a local maximum at 0 and a local minimum when 
, but these were
hidden in Figure 2. Indeed, if we now zoom in toward the origin in Figure 4, we see
what we missed before: a local maximum value of 0 when 
and a local minimum
value of about 
when 
.
What about concavity and inﬂection points? From Figures 2 and 4 there appear to be
inﬂection points when is a little to the left of 
and when is a little to the right of 0.
But it’s difﬁcult to determine inﬂection points from the graph of , so we graph the sec-
ond derivative 
in Figure 5. We see that 
changes from positive to negative when
and from negative to positive when 
. So, correct to two decimal
places, 
is concave upward on 
and 
and concave downward on
. The inﬂection points are 
and 
.
We have discovered that no single graph reveals all the important features of this
polynomial. But Figures 2 and 4, when taken together, do provide an accurate picture.
M
EXAMPLE 2 Draw the graph of the function
in a viewing rectangle that contains all the important features of the function. Estimate
the maximum and minimum values and the intervals of concavity. Then use calculus to
ﬁnd these quantities exactly.
SOLUTION Figure 6, produced by a computer with automatic scaling, is a disaster. Some
graphing calculators use 
by 
as the default viewing rectangle, so let’s
try it. We get the graph shown in Figure 7; it’s a major improvement.
The -axis appears to be a vertical asymptote and indeed it is because 
Figure 7 also allows us to estimate the -intercepts: about 
and 
. The exact val-
ues are obtained by using the quadratic formula to solve the equation
;
we get 
.
To get a better look at horizontal asymptotes, we change to the viewing rectangle
by 
in Figure 8. It appears that 
is the horizontal asymptote and
this is easily conﬁrmed:

in Figure 9. The cursor indicates that the absolute minimum value is about

increases on

Figure 9 also shows that an inﬂection point occurs somewhere between 
and
. We could estimate it much more accurately using the graph of the second deriv-
ative, but in this case it’s just as easy to ﬁnd exact values. Since
we see that

and concave downward on 
. The inﬂection point is

The analysis using the ﬁrst two derivatives shows that Figures 7 and 8 display all the
major aspects of the curve.

EXAMPLE 3 Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Drawing on our experience with a rational function in Example 2, let’s start by
graphing 
in the viewing rectangle 
by 
. From Figure 10 we have
the feeling that we are going to have to zoom in to see some ﬁner detail and also zoom
out to see the larger picture. But, as a guide to intelligent zooming, let’s ﬁrst take a close
look at the expression for 
. Because of the factors 
and 
in the
denominator, we expect 
and 
to be the vertical asymptotes. Indeed
To ﬁnd the horizontal asymptotes we divide numerator and denominator by 
:
This shows that 
, so the -axis is a horizontal asymptote.
It is also very useful to consider the behavior of the graph near the -intercepts using
an analysis like that in Example 11 in Section 2.6. Since 
is positive, 
does not
change sign at 0 and so its graph doesn’t cross the -axis at 0. But, because of the factor
, the graph does cross the -axis at 
and has a horizontal tangent there.
Putting all this information together, but without using derivatives, we see that the curve
has to look something like the one in Figure 11.

Now that we know what to look for, we zoom in (several times) to produce the graphs
in Figures 12 and 13 and zoom out (several times) to get Figure 14.
We can read from these graphs that the absolute minimum is about 
and occurs
when 
. There is also a local maximum
when 
and a local
minimum
when 
. These graphs also show three inﬂection points near 
and 
and two between 
and . To estimate the inﬂection points closely we
would need to graph 
, but to compute 
by hand is an unreasonable chore. If you
have a computer algebra system, then it’s easy to do (see Exercise 15).
We have seen that, for this particular function, three graphs (Figures 12, 13, and 14)
are necessary to convey all the useful information. The only way to display all these
features of the function on a single graph is to draw it by hand. Despite the exaggera-
tions and distortions, Figure 11 does manage to summarize the essential nature of the
function.

EXAMPLE 4 Graph the function 
. For 
, estimate all
maximum and minimum values, intervals of increase and decrease, and inﬂection points
correct to one decimal place.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst note that 
is periodic with period 
. Also, 
is odd and 
for all . So the choice of a viewing rectangle is not a problem for this function: We start
with 
by 
. (See Figure 15.) 
It appears that there are three local maximum values and two local minimum values in
that window. To conﬁrm this and locate them more accurately, we calculate that
and graph both 
and 
in Figure 16.

Using zoom-in and the First Derivative Test, we ﬁnd the following values to one deci-
mal place.
The second derivative is
Graphing both 
and 
in Figure 17, we obtain the following approximate values:
Having checked that Figure 15 does indeed represent 
accurately for 
, 
we can state that the extended graph in Figure 18 represents 
accurately for
.
M
Our ﬁnal example is concerned with families of functions. As discussed in Section 1.4,
this means that the functions in the family are related to each other by a formula that con-
tains one or more arbitrary constants. Each value of the constant gives rise to a member of
the family and the idea is to see how the graph of the function changes as the constant
changes.
EXAMPLE 5 How does the graph of 
vary as varies?
SOLUTION The graphs in Figures 19 and 20 (the special cases 
and 
) show
two very different-looking curves. Before drawing any more graphs, let’s see what mem-
bers of this family have in common. Since
for any value of , they all have the -axis as a horizontal asymptote. A vertical asymp-
tote will occur when 
. Solving this quadratic equation, we get
. When 
, there is no vertical asymptote (as in Figure 19). When
, the graph has a single vertical asymptote 
because
When 
, there are two vertical asymptotes: 
(as in Figure 20).
Now we compute the derivative:

, this means that 
increases on

, there is an absolute maximum value
. For 
, 
is a local maximum value and the
intervals of increase and decrease are interrupted at the vertical asymptotes.
Figure 21 is a “slide show” displaying ﬁve members of the family, all graphed in the
viewing rectangle 
by 
. As predicted, 
is the value at which a transi-
tion takes place from two vertical asymptotes to one, and then to none. As increases 
from , we see that the maximum point becomes lower; this is explained by the fact that
as 
. As decreases from , the vertical asymptotes become more
widely separated because the distance between them is 
, which becomes large
as 
. Again, the maximum point approaches the -axis because 
as 
.
There is clearly no inﬂection point when 
. For 
we calculate that
and deduce that inﬂection points occur when 
. So the inﬂection
points become more spread out as increases and this seems plausible from the last two
parts of Figure 21.

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
The methods we have learned in this chapter for ﬁnding extreme values have practical
applications in many areas of life. A businessperson wants to minimize costs and maxi-
mize proﬁts. A traveler wants to minimize transportation time. Fermat’s Principle in optics
states that light follows the path that takes the least time. In this section and the next we
solve such problems as maximizing areas, volumes, and proﬁts and minimizing distances,
times, and costs.
In solving such practical problems the greatest challenge is often to convert the word
problem into a mathematical optimization problem by setting up the function that is to be
maximized or minimized. Let’s recall the problem-solving principles discussed on page 76
and adapt them to this situation:
STEPS IN SOLVING OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
1. Understand the Problem The ﬁrst step is to read the problem carefully until it is
clearly understood. Ask yourself: What is the unknown? What are the given quanti-
ties? What are the given conditions?
2. Draw a Diagram In most problems it is useful to draw a diagram and identify the
given and required quantities on the diagram.
3. Introduce Notation Assign a symbol to the quantity that is to be maximized or
minimized (let’s call it 
for now). Also select symbols 
for other
unknown quantities and label the diagram with these symbols. It may help to use
initials as suggestive symbols—for example, 
for area, for height, for time.
4. Express 
in terms of some of the other symbols from Step 3.
5. If 
has been expressed as a function of more than one variable in Step 4, use the
given information to ﬁnd relationships (in the form of equations) among these
variables. Then use these equations to eliminate all but one of the variables in the
expression for . Thus 
will be expressed as a function of one variable , say,
. Write the domain of this function.
6. Use the methods of Sections 4.1 and 4.3 to ﬁnd the absolute maximum or mini-
mum value of . In particular, if the domain of 
is a closed interval, then the
Closed Interval Method in Section 4.1 can be used.
EXAMPLE 1 A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular ﬁeld
that borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What are the dimensions
of the ﬁeld that has the largest area?
SOLUTION In order to get a feeling for what is happening in this problem, let’s experiment
with some special cases. Figure 1 (not to scale) shows three possible ways of laying out 
the 2400 ft of fencing.

We see that when we try shallow, wide ﬁelds or deep, narrow ﬁelds, we get relatively
small areas. It seems plausible that there is some intermediate conﬁguration that pro-
duces the largest area.
Figure 2 illustrates the general case. We wish to maximize the area 
of the rectangle.
Let and be the depth and width of the rectangle (in feet). Then we express 
in terms
of and :
We want to express 
as a function of just one variable, so we eliminate by expressing
it in terms of . To do this we use the given information that the total length of the fenc-
ing is 2400 ft. Thus 
From this equation we have 
, which gives
Note that 
0 and 
(otherwise 
). So the function that we wish to maxi-
mize is
The derivative is 
, so to ﬁnd the critical numbers we solve the 
equation
which gives 
. The maximum value of 
must occur either at this critical number
or at an endpoint of the interval. Since 
, and 
,
the Closed Interval Method gives the maximum value as 
.
[Alternatively, we could have observed that 
for all , so 
is always
concave downward and the local maximum at 
must be an absolute maximum.]
Thus the rectangular ﬁeld should be 600 ft deep and 1200 ft wide.

EXAMPLE 2 A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1 L of oil. Find the dimensions
that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can.
SOLUTION Draw the diagram as in Figure 3, where is the radius and 
the height (both in
centimeters). In order to minimize the cost of the metal, we minimize the total surface
area of the cylinder (top, bottom, and sides). From Figure 4 we see that the sides are
made from a rectangular sheet with dimensions 
and h. So the surface area is
To eliminate we use the fact that the volume is given as 1 L, which we take to be
1000 cm . Thus
which gives

Therefore the function that we want to minimize is
To ﬁnd the critical numbers, we differentiate:
Then 
when 
, so the only critical number is 
.
Since the domain of 
is 
, we can’t use the argument of Example 1 concerning
endpoints. But we can observe that 
for 
and 
for
, so 
is decreasing for all
to the left of the critical number and increas-
ing for all
to the right. Thus 
must give rise to an absolute minimum.
[Alternatively, we could argue that 
as 
and 
as 
, so
there must be a minimum value of 
, which must occur at the critical number. See
Figure 5.]
The value of corresponding to 
is
Thus, to minimize the cost of the can, the radius should be 
cm and the height
should be equal to twice the radius, namely, the diameter.
M
The argument used in Example 2 to justify the absolute minimum is a variant
of the First Derivative Test (which applies only to local maximum or minimum values) and
is stated here for future reference.
FIRST DERIVATIVE TEST FOR ABSOLUTE EXTREME VALUES Suppose that is a criti-
cal number of a continuous function 
deﬁned on an interval.
(a) If 
for all 
and 
for all 
, then 
is the absolute
maximum value of .
(b) If 
for all 
and 
for all 
, then 
is the absolute
minimum value of .
An alternative method for solving optimization problems is to use implicit dif-
ferentiation. Let’s look at Example 2 again to illustrate the method. We work with the same
equations
but instead of eliminating h, we differentiate both equations implicitly with respect to r:
The minimum occurs at a critical number, so we set 
, simplify, and arrive at the
equations
and subtraction gives

EXAMPLE 3 Find the point on the parabola 
that is closest to the point 
.
SOLUTION The distance between the point 
and the point 
is
(See Figure 6.) But if 
lies on the parabola, then 
, so the expression for 
becomes
(Alternatively, we could have substituted 
to get 
in terms of alone.) Instead
of minimizing , we minimize its square:
(You should convince yourself that the minimum of 
occurs at the same point as the
minimum of 
, but 
is easier to work with.) Differentiating, we obtain
so 
when 
. Observe that 
when 
and 
when
, so by the First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values, the absolute mini-
mum occurs when 
. (Or we could simply say that because of the geometric nature
of the problem, it’s obvious that there is a closest point but not a farthest point.) The
corresponding value of is 
. Thus the point on 
closest to

EXAMPLE 4 A man launches his boat from point 
on a bank of a straight river, 3 km
wide, and wants to reach point , 8 km downstream on the opposite bank, as quickly as
possible (see Figure 7). He could row his boat directly across the river to point 
and
then run to , or he could row directly to , or he could row to some point 
between 
and 
and then run to . If he can row 6 km#h and run 8 km#h, where should he land to
reach 
as soon as possible? (We assume that the speed of the water is negligible com-
pared with the speed at which the man rows.)
SOLUTION If we let be the distance from 
to , then the running distance is
and the Pythagorean Theorem gives the rowing distance as
. We use the equation
Then the rowing time is 
and the running time is 
, so the total time
as a function of is

EXAMPLE 5 Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle
of radius .
SOLUTION 1 Let’s take the semicircle to be the upper half of the circle 
with
center the origin. Then the word inscribed means that the rectangle has two vertices on
the semicircle and two vertices on the -axis as shown in Figure 9.
Let 
be the vertex that lies in the ﬁrst quadrant. Then the rectangle has sides of
lengths 
and , so its area is
To eliminate we use the fact that 
lies on the circle 
and so
. Thus
The domain of this function is 
. Its derivative is
which is 0 when 
, that is, 
(since

maximum value of 
since

inscribed rectangle is

APPLICATIONS TO BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
In Section 3.7 we introduced the idea of marginal cost. Recall that if 
, the cost func-
tion, is the cost of producing units of a certain product, then the marginal cost is the rate
of change of 
with respect to . In other words, the marginal cost function is the deriva-
tive, 
, of the cost function.
Now let’s consider marketing. Let 
be the price per unit that the company can
charge if it sells units. Then is called the demand function (or price function) and we
would expect it to be a decreasing function of . If 
units are sold and the price per unit
is 
, then the total revenue is
and 
is called the revenue function. The derivative 
of the revenue function is called
the marginal revenue function and is the rate of change of revenue with respect to the
number of units sold.
If units are sold, then the total proﬁt is
and 
is called the proﬁt function. The marginal proﬁt function is 
, the derivative of
the proﬁt function. In Exercises 53–58 you are asked to use the marginal cost, revenue,
and proﬁt functions to minimize costs and maximize revenues and proﬁts.
EXAMPLE 6 A store has been selling 200 DVD burners a week at 
each. A mar-
ket survey indicates that for each 
rebate offered to buyers, the number of units sold
will increase by 20 a week. Find the demand function and the revenue function. How
large a rebate should the store offer to maximize its revenue?
SOLUTION If is the number of DVD burners sold per week, then the weekly increase in
sales is 
. For each increase of 20 units sold, the price is decreased by 
. So for
each additional unit sold, the decrease in price will be 
and the demand function
is
The revenue function is
Since 
, we see that 
when 
. This value of gives an
absolute maximum by the First Derivative Test (or simply by observing that the graph of
is a parabola that opens downward). The corresponding price is
and the rebate is 
. Therefore, to maximize revenue, the store should
offer a rebate of 
.

at one end with a trihedral angle at the other end as in the ﬁg-

minimize the surface area for a given volume, thus using the
least amount of wax in cell construction. Examination of these
cells has shown that the measure of the apex angle 
is amaz-
ingly consistent. Based on the geometry of the cell, it can be

An object is to be placed at a point

intensity of illumination is minimized. We need to use the

73. Ornithologists have determined that some species of birds
tend to avoid ﬂights over large bodies of water during
daylight hours. It is believed that more energy is required to
ﬂy over water than land because air generally rises over land
and falls over water during the day. A bird with these tenden-
cies is released from an island that is 5 km from the nearest
point 
on a straight shoreline, ﬂies to a point 
on the shore-
line, and then ﬂies along the shoreline to its nesting area .

APPLIED PROJECT THE SHAPE OF A CAN
||||
333
In this project we investigate the most economical shape for a can. We ﬁrst interpret this to mean
that the volume 
of a cylindrical can is given and we need to ﬁnd the height and radius that
minimize the cost of the metal to make the can (see the ﬁgure). If we disregard any waste metal
in the manufacturing process, then the problem is to minimize the surface area of the cylinder.
We solved this problem in Example 2 in Section 4.7 and we found that 
; that is, the height
should be the same as the diameter. But if you go to your cupboard or your supermarket with a
ruler, you will discover that the height is usually greater than the diameter and the ratio 
varies
from 2 up to about 3.8. Let’s see if we can explain this phenomenon.
1. The material for the cans is cut from sheets of metal. The cylindrical sides are formed by
bending rectangles; these rectangles are cut from the sheet with little or no waste. But if the

top and bottom discs are cut from squares of side 
(as in the ﬁgure), this leaves considerable
waste metal, which may be recycled but has little or no value to the can makers. If this is the
case, show that the amount of metal used is minimized when
2. A more efﬁcient packing of the discs is obtained by dividing the metal sheet into hexagons and
cutting the circular lids and bases from the hexagons (see the ﬁgure). Show that if this strategy
is adopted, then
3. The values of 
that we found in Problems 1 and 2 are a little closer to the ones that 
actually occur on supermarket shelves, but they still don’t account for everything. If we 
look more closely at some real cans, we see that the lid and the base are formed from discs
with radius larger than that are bent over the ends of the can. If we allow for this we would
increase 
. More signiﬁcantly, in addition to the cost of the metal we need to incorporate the
manufacturing of the can into the cost. Let’s assume that most of the expense is incurred in
joining the sides to the rims of the cans. If we cut the discs from hexagons as in Problem 2,
then the total cost is proportional to
where is the reciprocal of the length that can be joined for the cost of one unit area of metal.
Show that this expression is minimized when
;
4. Plot 
as a function of 
and use your graph to argue that when a can is large or
joining is cheap, we should make 
approximately 2.21 (as in Problem 2). But when the can
is small or joining is costly, 
should be substantially larger.
5. Our analysis shows that large cans should be almost square but small cans should be tall and
thin. Take a look at the relative shapes of the cans in a supermarket. Is our conclusion usually
true in practice? Are there exceptions? Can you suggest reasons why small cans are not always
tall and thin?

NEWTON’S METHOD
Suppose that a car dealer offers to sell you a car for $18,000 or for payments of $375 per
month for ﬁve years. You would like to know what monthly interest rate the dealer is, in
effect, charging you. To ﬁnd the answer, you have to solve the equation
(The details are explained in Exercise 41.) How would you solve such an equation?
For a quadratic equation 
there is a well-known formula for the roots.
For third- and fourth-degree equations there are also formulas for the roots, but they are

extremely complicated. If f is a polynomial of degree 5 or higher, there is no such formula
(see the note on page 210). Likewise, there is no formula that will enable us to ﬁnd the
exact roots of a transcendental equation such as 
.
We can ﬁnd an approximate solution to Equation 1 by plotting the left side of the equa-
tion. Using a graphing device, and after experimenting with viewing rectangles, we pro-
duce the graph in Figure 1.
We see that in addition to the solution x ! 0, which doesn’t interest us, there is a solu-
tion between 0.007 and 0.008. Zooming in shows that the root is approximately 0.0076. If
we need more accuracy we could zoom in repeatedly, but that becomes tiresome. A faster
alternative is to use a numerical rootﬁnder on a calculator or computer algebra system. If
we do so, we ﬁnd that the root, correct to nine decimal places, is 0.007628603.
How do those numerical rootﬁnders work? They use a variety of methods, but most of
them make some use of Newton’s method, also called the Newton-Raphson method. We
will explain how this method works, partly to show what happens inside a calculator or
computer, and partly as an application of the idea of linear approximation.
The geometry behind Newton’s method is shown in Figure 2, where the root that we are
trying to ﬁnd is labeled . We start with a ﬁrst approximation 
, which is obtained by
guessing, or from a rough sketch of the graph of , or from a computer-generated graph 
of f. Consider the tangent line 
to the curve 
at the point 
and look 
at the -intercept of , labeled . The idea behind Newton’s method is that the tangent line
is close to the curve and so its x-intercept, 
, is close to the x-intercept of the curve 
(namely, the root r that we are seeking). Because the tangent is a line, we can easily ﬁnd
its x-intercept.
To ﬁnd a formula for 
in terms of 
we use the fact that the slope of L is 
, so its
equation is
Since the -intercept of 
is 
, we set 
and obtain
If 
, we can solve this equation for 
:
We use 
as a second approximation to r.
Next we repeat this procedure with 
replaced by 
, using the tangent line at
. This gives a third approximation:
If we keep repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of approximations 
as shown in Figure 3. In general, if the th approximation is 
and

If the numbers 
become closer and closer to as 
becomes large, then we say that
the sequence converges to and we write
| Although the sequence of successive approximations converges to the desired root for
functions of the type illustrated in Figure 3, in certain circumstances the sequence may not
converge. For example, consider the situation shown in Figure 4. You can see that 
is a
worse approximation than . This is likely to be the case when 
is close to 0. It might
even happen that an approximation (such as 
in Figure 4) falls outside the domain of .
Then Newton’s method fails and a better initial approximation 
should be chosen. See
Exercises 31–34 for speciﬁc examples in which Newton’s method works very slowly or
does not work at all.
EXAMPLE 1 Starting with 
, ﬁnd the third approximation 
to the root of the 
equation

Newton himself used this equation to illustrate his method and he chose 
after
some experimentation because

, and

With 
we have
Then with 
we obtain
It turns out that this third approximation 
is accurate to four decimal places.
M
Suppose that we want to achieve a given accuracy, say to eight decimal places, using
Newton’s method. How do we know when to stop? The rule of thumb that is generally used
is that we can stop when successive approximations 
and 
agree to eight decimal
places. (A precise statement concerning accuracy in Newton’s method will be given in
Exercise 37 in Section 11.11.)
Notice that the procedure in going from to 
is the same for all values of . (It is
called an iterative process.) This means that Newton’s method is particularly convenient
for use with a programmable calculator or a computer.

lator or computer provides. Figure 7 suggests that we use 
as the initial approx-

and so we obtain the same answer as before, but with one fewer step.
You might wonder why we bother at all with Newton’s method if a graphing device is
available. Isn’t it easier to zoom in repeatedly and ﬁnd the roots as we did in Section 1.4?
If only one or two decimal places of accuracy are required, then indeed Newton’s method
is inappropriate and a graphing device sufﬁces. But if six or eight decimal places are
required, then repeated zooming becomes tiresome. It is usually faster and more efﬁcient
to use a computer and Newton’s method in tandem—the graphing device to get started and
Newton’s method to ﬁnish.

ANTIDERIVATIVES
A physicist who knows the velocity of a particle might wish to know its position at a given
time. An engineer who can measure the variable rate at which water is leaking from a tank
wants to know the amount leaked over a certain time period. A biologist who knows the
rate at which a bacteria population is increasing might want to deduce what the size of 
the population will be at some future time. In each case, the problem is to ﬁnd a function
F whose derivative is a known function f. If such a function F exists, it is called an anti-
derivative of f.
DEFINITION A function 
is called an antiderivative of 
on an interval if
for all in .
For instance, let 
. It isn’t difﬁcult to discover an antiderivative of if we keep
the Power Rule in mind. In fact, if 
, then 
. But the function
also satisﬁes 
. Therefore both 
and 
are antiderivatives 
of . Indeed, any function of the form 
, where 
is a constant, is an anti-
derivative of . The question arises: Are there any others?
To answer this question, recall that in Section 4.2 we used the Mean Value Theorem to
prove that if two functions have identical derivatives on an interval, then they must differ
by a constant (Corollary 4.2.7). Thus if 
and 
are any two antiderivatives of , then
so 
, where 
is a constant. We can write this as 
, so we
have the following result.
THEOREM If 
is an antiderivative of 
on an interval , then the most general
antiderivative of on is
where 
is an arbitrary constant.
Going back to the function 
, we see that the general antiderivative of 
is
. By assigning speciﬁc values to the constant , we obtain a family of functions
whose graphs are vertical translates of one another (see Figure 1). This makes sense
because each curve must have the same slope at any given value of .x

Thus the general antiderivative of

(but

As in Example 1, every differentiation formula, when read from right to left, gives rise
to an antidifferentiation formula. In Table 2 we list some particular antiderivatives. Each
formula in the table is true because the derivative of the function in the right column
appears in the left column. In particular, the ﬁrst formula says that the antiderivative of a
constant times a function is the constant times the antiderivative of the function. The sec-
ond formula says that the antiderivative of a sum is the sum of the antiderivatives. (We use
the notation

In applications of calculus it is very common to have a situation as in Example 2, where
it is required to ﬁnd a function, given knowledge about its derivatives. An equation that
involves the derivatives of a function is called a differential equation. These will be 
studied in some detail in Chapter 9, but for the present we can solve some elementary dif-
ferential equations. The general solution of a differential equation involves an arbitrary
constant (or constants) as in Example 2. However, there may be some extra conditions
given that will determine the constants and therefore uniquely specify the solution.

If we are given the graph of a function , it seems reasonable that we should be able to
sketch the graph of an antiderivative . Suppose, for instance, that we are given that
. Then we have a place to start, the point 
, and the direction in which we
move our pencil is given at each stage by the derivative 
. In the next example
we use the principles of this chapter to show how to graph 
even when we don’t have a
formula for . This would be the case, for instance, when 
is determined by experi-
mental data.

RECTILINEAR MOTION
Antidifferentiation is particularly useful in analyzing the motion of an object moving in a
straight line. Recall that if the object has position function 
, then the velocity func-
tion is 
. This means that the position function is an antiderivative of the veloc-
ity function. Likewise, the acceleration function is 
, so the velocity function is
an antiderivative of the acceleration. If the acceleration and the initial values 
and 
are known, then the position function can be found by antidifferentiating twice.
EXAMPLE 6 A particle moves in a straight line and has acceleration given by
. Its initial velocity is 
cm$s and its initial displacement is
cm. Find its position function 
.

An object near the surface of the earth is subject to a gravitational force that produces
a downward acceleration denoted by . For motion close to the ground we may assume that
is constant, its value being about 
(or 
ft$s ).
EXAMPLE 7 A ball is thrown upward with a speed of 
ft$s from the edge of a cliff 
ft above the ground. Find its height above the ground seconds later. When does it
reach its maximum height? When does it hit the ground?
SOLUTION The motion is vertical and we choose the positive direction to be upward. At
time the distance above the ground is 
and the velocity 
is decreasing. Therefore,
the acceleration must be negative and we have
Taking antiderivatives, we have
To determine 
we use the given information that 
. This gives

The maximum height is reached when 
, that is, after

Using the quadratic formula to solve this equation, we get
We reject the solution with the minus sign since it gives a negative value for . Therefore

One of the most important principles of problem solving is analogy (see page 76). If you
are having trouble getting started on a problem, it is sometimes helpful to start by solving
a similar, but simpler, problem. The following example illustrates the principle. Cover up
the solution and try solving it yourself ﬁrst.

SOLUTION It may be difﬁcult to get started on this problem. (Some students have tackled 
it by multiplying out the numerator, but that just creates a mess.) Let’s try to think of a
similar, simpler problem. When several variables are involved, it’s often helpful to think
of an analogous problem with fewer variables. In the present case we can reduce the
number of variables from three to one and prove the analogous inequality
In fact, if we are able to prove (1), then the desired inequality follows because
The key to proving (1) is to recognize that it is a disguised version of a minimum prob-
lem. If we let

and, as previously mentioned, the given inequality follows by multiplication.
The inequality in (1) could also be proved without calculus. In fact, if

In Chapter 2 we used the tangent and velocity problems to introduce the derivative,
which is the central idea in differential calculus. In much the same way, this chapter
starts with the area and distance problems and uses them to formulate the idea of a
deﬁnite integral, which is the basic concept of integral calculus. We will see in
Chapters 6 and 8 how to use the integral to solve problems concerning volumes, lengths
of curves, population predictions, cardiac output, forces on a dam, work, consumer
surplus, and baseball, among many others.
There is a connection between integral calculus and differential calculus. The Funda-
mental Theorem of Calculus relates the integral to the derivative, and we will see in this
chapter that it greatly simpliﬁes the solution of many problems.
To compute an area we approximate a region by rectangles 
and let the number of rectangles become large.The precise 
area is the limit of these sums of areas of rectangles.
INTEGRALS

AREAS AND DISTANCES
In this section we discover that in trying to ﬁnd the area under a curve or the distance 
traveled by a car, we end up with the same special type of limit.
THE AREA PROBLEM
We begin by attempting to solve the area problem: Find the area of the region 
that lies
under the curve 
from to . This means that , illustrated in Figure 1, is bounded
by the graph of a continuous function 
[where 
], the vertical lines 
and
, and the -axis.
In trying to solve the area problem we have to ask ourselves: What is the meaning of
the word area? This question is easy to answer for regions with straight sides. For a rect-
angle, the area is deﬁned as the product of the length and the width. The area of a triangle
is half the base times the height. The area of a polygon is found by dividing it into tri-
angles (as in Figure 2) and adding the areas of the triangles.
However, it isn’t so easy to ﬁnd the area of a region with curved sides. We all have an
intuitive idea of what the area of a region is. But part of the area problem is to make this
intuitive idea precise by giving an exact deﬁnition of area.
Recall that in deﬁning a tangent we ﬁrst approximated the slope of the tangent line by
slopes of secant lines and then we took the limit of these approximations. We pursue a sim-
ilar idea for areas. We ﬁrst approximate the region 
by rectangles and then we take the
limit of the areas of these rectangles as we increase the number of rectangles. The follow-
ing example illustrates the procedure.
EXAMPLE 1 Use rectangles to estimate the area under the parabola 
from 0 to 1 
(the parabolic region S illustrated in Figure 3).
SOLUTION We ﬁrst notice that the area of S must be somewhere between 0 and 1 because 
is contained in a square with side length 1, but we can certainly do better than that.

Suppose we divide S into four strips 
,
,
, and 
by drawing the vertical lines 
,
, and 
as in Figure 4(a).
We can approximate each strip by a rectangle whose base is the same as the strip and
whose height is the same as the right edge of the strip [see Figure 4(b)]. In other words,
the heights of these rectangles are the values of the function 
at the right end-
points of the subintervals 
,
,
, and 
.
Each rectangle has width and the heights are 
,
,
, and 
. If we let 
be
the sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles, we get
From Figure 4(b) we see that the area A of S is less than 
, so
Instead of using the rectangles in Figure 4(b) we could use the smaller rectangles in
Figure 5 whose heights are the values of 
at the left endpoints of the subintervals. (The
leftmost rectangle has collapsed because its height is 0.) The sum of the areas of these
approximating rectangles is
We see that the area of S is larger than 
, so we have lower and upper estimates for A:
We can repeat this procedure with a larger number of strips. Figure 6 shows what
happens when we divide the region S into eight strips of equal width.

By computing the sum of the areas of the smaller rectangles 
and the sum of the
areas of the larger rectangles 
, we obtain better lower and upper estimates for A:
So one possible answer to the question is to say that the true area of S lies somewhere
between 0.2734375 and 0.3984375.
We could obtain better estimates by increasing the number of strips. The table at the
left shows the results of similar calculations (with a computer) using n rectangles whose
heights are found with left endpoints 
or right endpoints 
. In particular, we see
by using 50 strips that the area lies between 0.3234 and 0.3434. With 1000 strips we
narrow it down even more: A lies between 0.3328335 and 0.3338335. A good estimate is
obtained by averaging these numbers:
.

From the values in the table in Example 1, it looks as if

is the sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 7. Each rectangle

Here we need the formula for the sum of the squares of the ﬁrst n positive integers:
Perhaps you have seen this formula before. It is proved in Example 5 in Appendix E.

DEFINITION The area A of the region S that lies under the graph of the contin-
uous function
is the limit of the sum of the areas of approximating rectangles:
It can be proved that the limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists, since we are assuming that
is continuous. It can also be shown that we get the same value if we use left endpoints:
In fact, instead of using left endpoints or right endpoints, we could take the height of the
ith rectangle to be the value of f at any number 
in the ith subinterval 
. We call
the numbers 
,
, . . . ,
the sample points. Figure 13 shows approximating rectangles
when the sample points are not chosen to be endpoints. So a more general expression for the
area of S is
We often use sigma notation to write sums with many terms more compactly. For
instance,

M
THE DISTANCE PROBLEM
Now let’s consider the distance problem: Find the distance traveled by an object during a
certain time period if the velocity of the object is known at all times. (In a sense this is the
inverse problem of the velocity problem that we discussed in Section 2.1.) If the velocity
remains constant, then the distance problem is easy to solve by means of the formula
But if the velocity varies, it’s not so easy to ﬁnd the distance traveled. We investigate the
problem in the following example.
EXAMPLE 4 Suppose the odometer on our car is broken and we want to estimate the
distance driven over a 30-second time interval. We take speedometer readings every ﬁve
seconds and record them in the following table:
In order to have the time and the velocity in consistent units, let’s convert the velocity
readings to feet per second (1 mi%h ! 5280%3600 ft%s):
During the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds the velocity doesn’t change very much, so we can estimate
the distance traveled during that time by assuming that the velocity is constant. If we
take the velocity during that time interval to be the initial velocity (25 ft%s), then we
obtain the approximate distance traveled during the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds:
Similarly, during the second time interval the velocity is approximately constant and we
take it to be the velocity when t ! 5 s. So our estimate for the distance traveled from
to 
is
If we add similar estimates for the other time intervals, we obtain an estimate for the
total distance traveled:

We could just as well have used the velocity at the end of each time period instead 
of the velocity at the beginning as our assumed constant velocity. Then our estimate
becomes
If we had wanted a more accurate estimate, we could have taken velocity readings
every two seconds, or even every second.
M
Perhaps the calculations in Example 4 remind you of the sums we used earlier to esti-
mate areas. The similarity is explained when we sketch a graph of the velocity function of
the car in Figure 16 and draw rectangles whose heights are the initial velocities for each
time interval. The area of the ﬁrst rectangle is 
, which is also our estimate
for the distance traveled in the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds. In fact, the area of each rectangle can be
interpreted as a distance because the height represents velocity and the width represents
time. The sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 16 is 
, which is our ini-
tial estimate for the total distance traveled.
In general, suppose an object moves with velocity 
, where 
and
(so the object always moves in the positive direction). We take velocity readings
at times 
so that the velocity is approximately constant on each
subinterval. If these times are equally spaced, then the time between consecutive readings
is 
. During the ﬁrst time interval the velocity is approximately 
and so
the distance traveled is approximately 
. Similarly, the distance traveled during the
second time interval is about 
and the total distance traveled during the time inter-
val 
is approximately
If we use the velocity at right endpoints instead of left endpoints, our estimate for the total
distance becomes
The more frequently we measure the velocity, the more accurate our estimates become, so
it seems plausible that the exact distance d traveled is the limit of such expressions:
We will see in Section 5.4 that this is indeed true.
Because Equation 5 has the same form as our expressions for area in Equations 2 and
3, it follows that the distance traveled is equal to the area under the graph of the velocity
function. In Chapters 6 and 8 we will see that other quantities of interest in the natural and
social sciences—such as the work done by a variable force or the cardiac output of the
heart—can also be interpreted as the area under a curve. So when we compute areas in this
chapter, bear in mind that they can be interpreted in a variety of practical ways.

in an Intelsat communications satellite. The table, provided
by NASA, gives the velocity data for the shuttle between
liftoff and the jettisoning of the solid rocket boosters. Use
these data to estimate the height above the earth’s surface of
the Endeavour, 62 seconds after liftoff.

THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
We saw in Section 5.1 that a limit of the form
arises when we compute an area. We also saw that it arises when we try to ﬁnd the dis-
tance traveled by an object. It turns out that this same type of limit occurs in a wide vari-
ety of situations even when is not necessarily a positive function. In Chapters 6 and 8 we
will see that limits of the form (1) also arise in ﬁnding lengths of curves, volumes of solids,
centers of mass, force due to water pressure, and work, as well as other quantities. We
therefore give this type of limit a special name and notation.
DEFINITION OF A DEFINITE INTEGRAL If 
is a function deﬁned for 
,
we divide the interval 
into n subintervals of equal width 
.
We let 
(! b) be the endpoints of these subintervals and we
let 
be any sample points in these subintervals, so 
lies in the ith
subinterval 
. Then the deﬁnite integral of f from a to b is
provided that this limit exists. If it does exist, we say that 
is integrable on 
.
The precise meaning of the limit that deﬁnes the integral is as follows:
For every number 
there is an integer 
such that
for every integer 
and for every choice of 
in 
.
The symbol 
was introduced by Leibniz and is called an integral sign. It is 
an elongated 
and was chosen because an integral is a limit of sums. In the notation
is called the integrand and 
and 
are called the limits of integration; 
is the lower limit and 
is the upper limit. For now, the symbol 
has no meaning 
by itself; 
is all one symbol. The 
simply indicates that the independent vari-
able is . The procedure of calculating an integral is called integration.

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS

The deﬁnite integral 
is a number; it does not depend on . In fact, we
could use any letter in place of without changing the value of the integral:
The sum
that occurs in Deﬁnition 2 is called a Riemann sum after the German mathematician
Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866). So Deﬁnition 2 says that the deﬁnite integral of an inte-
grable function can be approximated to within any desired degree of accuracy by a Riemann
sum.
We know that if 
happens to be positive, then the Riemann sum can be interpreted as
a sum of areas of approximating rectangles (see Figure 1). By comparing Deﬁnition 2 with
the deﬁnition of area in Section 5.1, we see that the deﬁnite integral 
can be inter-
preted as the area under the curve 
from a to b. (See Figure 2.)
If 
takes on both positive and negative values, as in Figure 3, then the Riemann sum is
the sum of the areas of the rectangles that lie above the -axis and the negatives of the areas
of the rectangles that lie below the -axis (the areas of the gold rectangles minus the areas
of the blue rectangles). When we take the limit of such Riemann sums, we get the situa-
tion illustrated in Figure 4. A deﬁnite integral can be interpreted as a net area, that is, a
difference of areas:
where 
is the area of the region above the -axis and below the graph of , and 
is the
area of the region below the -axis and above the graph of .
Although we have deﬁned 
by dividing 
into subintervals of
equal width, there are situations in which it is advantageous to work with subintervals 
of unequal width. For instance, in Exercise 14 in Section 5.1 NASA provided velocity data
at times that were not equally spaced, but we were still able to estimate the distance trav-
eled. And there are methods for numerical integration that take advantage of unequal
subintervals.

Bernhard Riemann received his Ph.D. under the
direction of the legendary Gauss at the University
of Göttingen and remained there to teach. Gauss,
who was not in the habit of praising other mathe-
maticians, spoke of Riemann’s “creative, active,
truly mathematical mind and gloriously fertile
originality.” The deﬁnition (2) of an integral that
we use is due to Riemann. He also made major
contributions to the theory of functions of a 
complex variable, mathematical physics, num-
ber theory, and the foundations of geometry. 
Riemann’s broad concept of space and geometry
turned out to be the right setting, 50 years later,
for Einstein’s general relativity theory. Riemann’s
health was poor throughout his life, and he died
of tuberculosis at the age of 39.

If the subinterval widths are 
, we have to ensure that all these widths
approach 0 in the limiting process. This happens if the largest width,
, approaches
0. So in this case the deﬁnition of a deﬁnite integral becomes
We have deﬁned the deﬁnite integral for an inegrable function, but not all func-
tions are integrable (see Exercises 67–68). The following theorem shows that the most
commonly occurring functions are in fact integrable. It is proved in more advanced courses.
THEOREM If

, or if 
has only a ﬁnite number of
jump discontinuities, then 
is integrable on 
; that is, the deﬁnite integral
exists.
If 
is integrable on 
, then the limit in Deﬁnition 2 exists and gives the same value
no matter how we choose the sample points 
. To simplify the calculation of the integral
we often take the sample points to be right endpoints. Then 
and the deﬁnition of
an integral simpliﬁes as follows.
THEOREM If 
is integrable on 
, then

SOLUTION Comparing the given limit with the limit in Theorem 4, we see that they will 
be identical if we choose 
. We are given that 
and

Therefore, by Theorem 4, we have
M
Later, when we apply the deﬁnite integral to physical situations, it will be important to
recognize limits of sums as integrals, as we did in Example 1. When Leibniz chose the
notation for an integral, he chose the ingredients as reminders of the limiting process. In
general, when we write

EVALUATING INTEGRALS
When we use a limit to evaluate a deﬁnite integral, we need to know how to work with
sums. The following three equations give formulas for sums of powers of positive integers.
Equation 5 may be familiar to you from a course in algebra. Equations 6 and 7 were dis-
cussed in Section 5.1 and are proved in Appendix E.
The remaining formulas are simple rules for working with sigma notation:

Notice that f is not a positive function and so the Riemann sum does not represent a sum
of areas of rectangles. But it does represent the sum of the areas of the gold rectangles
(above the x-axis) minus the sum of the areas of the blue rectangles (below the x-axis) in
Figure 5.

THE MIDPOINT RULE
We often choose the sample point 
to be the right endpoint of the th subinterval because
it is convenient for computing the limit. But if the purpose is to ﬁnd an approximation to
an integral, it is usually better to choose 
to be the midpoint of the interval, which we
denote by . Any Riemann sum is an approximation to an integral, but if we use midpoints
we get the following approximation.

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS

At the moment we don’t know how accurate the approximation in Example 5 is, but in
Section 7.7 we will learn a method for estimating the error involved in using the Midpoint
Rule. At that time we will discuss other methods for approximating deﬁnite integrals.
If we apply the Midpoint Rule to the integral in Example 2, we get the picture in Fig-
ure 12. The approximation 
is much closer to the true value 
than the
right endpoint approximation,
, shown in Figure 7.
PROPERTIES OF THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
When we deﬁned the deﬁnite integral 
, we implicitly assumed that

deﬁnition as a limit of Riemann sums makes sense even if 
. Notice that if we reverse
a and b, then 
changes from

Property 2 says that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. For positive func-
tions it says that the area under 
is the area under 
plus the area under t. Figure 14
helps us understand why this is true: In view of how graphical addition works, the corre-
sponding vertical line segments have equal height.
In general, Property 2 follows from Theorem 4 and the fact that the limit of a sum is the
sum of the limits:
Property 3 can be proved in a similar manner and says that the integral of a constant
times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. In other words, a con-
stant (but only a constant) can be taken in front of an integral sign. Property 4 is proved by
writing 
and using Properties 2 and 3 with 
.
EXAMPLE 6 Use the properties of integrals to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Using Properties 2 and 3 of integrals, we have
We know from Property 1 that
and we found in Example 2 in Section 5.1 that 
. So
M
The next property tells us how to combine integrals of the same function over adjacent
intervals:
5.
This is not easy to prove in general, but for the case where 
and 
Property 5 can be seen from the geometric interpretation in Figure 15: The area under
from a to c plus the area from c to b is equal to the total area from a to b.

because we know that multiplying a function

interpretation of Property 6 is simply that areas are positive. But the property can be
proved from the deﬁnition of an integral (Exercise 64). Property 7 says that a bigger func-

area of the rectangle with height 
and less than the area of the rectangle with height

PROOF OF PROPERTY 8
Since 
, Property 7 gives
Using Property 1 to evaluate the integrals on the left and right sides, we obtain
M
Property 8 is useful when all we want is a rough estimate of the size of an integral with-

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is appropriately named because it establishes a
connection between the two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calcu-
lus. Differential calculus arose from the tangent problem, whereas integral calculus arose
from a seemingly unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton’s mentor at Cambridge,
5.3

Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), discovered that these two problems are actually closely 
related. In fact, he realized that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. The
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives the precise inverse relationship between the
derivative and the integral. It was Newton and Leibniz who exploited this relationship and
used it to develop calculus into a systematic mathematical method. In particular, they saw
that the Fundamental Theorem enabled them to compute areas and integrals very easily
without having to compute them as limits of sums as we did in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
The ﬁrst part of the Fundamental Theorem deals with functions deﬁned by an equation
of the form
where 
is a continuous function on 
and 
varies between 
and . Observe that 
depends only on , which appears as the variable upper limit in the integral. If is a ﬁxed
number, then the integral 
is a deﬁnite number. If we then let 
vary, the number
also varies and deﬁnes a function of denoted by 
.
If 
happens to be a positive function, then 
can be interpreted as the area under the
graph of 
from to , where can vary from to . (Think of as the “area so far” func-
tion; see Figure 1.)
EXAMPLE 1 If 
is the function whose graph is shown in Figure 2 and
, ﬁnd the values of

, and 
. Then sketch a
rough graph of .
SOLUTION First we notice that 
. From Figure 3 we see that 
is the
area of a triangle:
To ﬁnd 
we add to 
the area of a rectangle:
We estimate that the area under 
from 2 to 3 is about 1.3, so

We use these values to sketch the graph of in Figure 4. Notice that, because

If we take

Equation 1, then 
turns out to be an antiderivative of , at least in this case. And if we
sketch the derivative of the function shown in Figure 4 by estimating slopes of tangents,
we get a graph like that of 
in Figure 2. So we suspect that 
in Example 1 too.
To see why this might be generally true we consider any continuous function 
with
. Then 
can be interpreted as the area under the graph of 
from
to , as in Figure 1.
In order to compute 
from the deﬁnition of derivative we ﬁrst observe that,
for 
is obtained by subtracting areas, so it is the area under the
graph of 
from 
to 
(the gold area in Figure 5). For small 
you can see from the
ﬁgure that this area is approximately equal to the area of the rectangle with height 
and
width :
so
Intuitively, we therefore expect that
The fact that this is true, even when is not necessarily positive, is the ﬁrst part of the Fun-
damental Theorem of Calculus.

By Property 8 of integrals, we have
that is,
Since 
, we can divide this inequality by :
Now we use Equation 2 to replace the middle part of this inequality:
Inequality 3 can be proved in a similar manner for the case
. (See Exercise 67.)
Now we let

If

M
Using Leibniz notation for derivatives, we can write FTC1 as
when 
is continuous. Roughly speaking, Equation 5 says that if we ﬁrst integrate 
and
then differentiate the result, we get back to the original function .
EXAMPLE 2 Find the derivative of the function

SOLUTION Since

Calculus gives
M
EXAMPLE 3 Although a formula of the form 
may seem like a strange
way of deﬁning a function, books on physics, chemistry, and statistics are full of such
functions. For instance, the Fresnel function
is named after the French physicist Augustin Fresnel (1788–1827), who is famous for his
works in optics. This function ﬁrst appeared in Fresnel’s theory of the diffraction of light
waves, but more recently it has been applied to the design of highways.
Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem tells us how to differentiate the Fresnel function:
This means that we can apply all the methods of differential calculus to analyze 
(see
Exercise 61).
Figure 7 shows the graphs of 
and the Fresnel function
. A computer was used to graph 
by computing the value of this 
integral for many values of . It does indeed look as if 
is the area under the graph 
of 
from to [until 
, when 
becomes a difference of areas]. Figure 8
shows a larger part of the graph of .
If we now start with the graph of 
in Figure 7 and think about what its derivative
should look like, it seems reasonable that 
. [For instance,
is increasing
when 
and decreasing when 
.] So this gives a visual conﬁrmation of
Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

In Section 5.2 we computed integrals from the deﬁnition as a limit of Riemann sums
and we saw that this procedure is sometimes long and difﬁcult. The second part of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which follows easily from the ﬁrst part, provides us
with a much simpler method for the evaluation of integrals.

N We abbreviate this theorem as FTC2.

Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem states that if we know an antiderivative 
of , then
we can evaluate 
simply by subtracting the values of 
at the endpoints of the
interval 
. It’s very surprising that 
, which was deﬁned by a complicated pro-
cedure involving all of the values of 
for 
, can be found by knowing the val-
ues of 
at only two points, and .
Although the theorem may be surprising at ﬁrst glance, it becomes plausible if we inter-
pret it in physical terms. If 
is the velocity of an object and 
is its position at time t,
then 
, so s is an antiderivative of . In Section 5.1 we considered an object that
always moves in the positive direction and made the guess that the area under the velocity
curve is equal to the distance traveled. In symbols:
That is exactly what FTC2 says in this context.
EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate the integral 
.
SOLUTION The function 
is continuous everywhere and we know that an anti-
derivative is 
, so Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem gives
Notice that FTC2 says we can use any antiderivative F of f. So we may as well use
the simplest one, namely 
, instead of 
or 
.
M
We often use the notation
So the equation of FTC2 can be written as
Other common notations are

When the French mathematician Gilles de Roberval ﬁrst found the area under the sine
and cosine curves in 1635, this was a very challenging problem that required a great deal
of ingenuity. If we didn’t have the beneﬁt of the Fundamental Theorem, we would have to
compute a difﬁcult limit of sums using obscure trigonometric identities (or a computer
algebra system as in Exercise 25 in Section 5.1). It was even more difﬁcult for Roberval
because the apparatus of limits had not been invented in 1635. But in the 1660s and 1670s,
when the Fundamental Theorem was discovered by Barrow and exploited by Newton and
Leibniz, such problems became very easy, as you can see from Example 8.

We noted that Part 1 can be rewritten as
which says that if

original function . Since 
, Part 2 can be rewritten as
This version says that if we take a function , ﬁrst differentiate it, and then integrate the
result, we arrive back at the original function , but in the form 
. Taken 
together, the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus say that differentiation
and integration are inverse processes. Each undoes what the other does.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is unquestionably the most important theorem
in calculus and, indeed, it ranks as one of the great accomplishments of the human mind.
Before it was discovered, from the time of Eudoxus and Archimedes to the time of Galileo
and Fermat, problems of ﬁnding areas, volumes, and lengths of curves were so difﬁcult
that only a genius could meet the challenge. But now, armed with the systematic method
that Newton and Leibniz fashioned out of the Fundamental Theorem, we will see in the
chapters to come that these challenging problems are accessible to all of us.

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS

INDEFINITE INTEGRALS AND THE NET CHANGE THEOREM
We saw in Section 5.3 that the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus pro-
vides a very powerful method for evaluating the deﬁnite integral of a function, assuming
that we can ﬁnd an antiderivative of the function. In this section we introduce a notation
for antiderivatives, review the formulas for antiderivatives, and use them to evaluate deﬁ-
nite integrals. We also reformulate FTC2 in a way that makes it easier to apply to science
and engineering problems.
INDEFINITE INTEGRALS
Both parts of the Fundamental Theorem establish connections between antiderivatives and
deﬁnite integrals. Part 1 says that if
is continuous, then 
is an antiderivative of . 
Part 2 says that 
can be found by evaluating 
, where F is an antideriv-
ative of f.
We need a convenient notation for antiderivatives that makes them easy to work with.
Because of the relation given by the Fundamental Theorem between antiderivatives and
integrals, the notation 
is traditionally used for an antiderivative of 
and is called
an indeﬁnite integral. Thus
means
For example, we can write
So we can regard an indeﬁnite integral as representing an entire family of functions (one
antiderivative for each value of the constant C).
|
You should distinguish carefully between deﬁnite and indeﬁnite integrals. A deﬁnite
integral 
is a number, whereas an indeﬁnite integral 
is a function (or
family of functions). The connection between them is given by Part 2 of the Fundamental
Theorem. If 
is continuous on 
, then
The effectiveness of the Fundamental Theorem depends on having a supply of anti-
derivatives of functions. We therefore restate the Table of Antidifferentiation Formulas
from Section 4.9, together with a few others, in the notation of indeﬁnite integrals. Any
formula can be veriﬁed by differentiating the function on the right side and obtaining the
integrand. For instance

TABLE OF INDEFINITE INTEGRALS
Recall from Theorem 4.9.1 that the most general antiderivative on a given interval is
obtained by adding a constant to a particular antiderivative. We adopt the convention that
when a formula for a general indeﬁnite integral is given, it is valid only on an inter-
val. Thus we write
with the understanding that it is valid on the interval 
or on the interval 
. This
is true despite the fact that the general antiderivative of the function
, 
, is

APPLICATIONS
Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem says that if f is continuous on 
, then
where F is any antiderivative of f. This means that 
, so the equation can be rewrit-
ten as
We know that 
represents the rate of change of 
with respect to x and
is the change in y when x changes from a to b. [Note that could, for instance,
increase, then decrease, then increase again. Although 
might change in both directions,
represents the net change in .] So we can reformulate FTC2 in words as 
follows.
THE NET CHANGE THEOREM The integral of a rate of change is the net change: 
This principle can be applied to all of the rates of change in the natural and social sci-
ences that we discussed in Section 3.7. Here are a few instances of this idea:
N If 
is the volume of water in a reservoir at time t, then its derivative 
is
the rate at which water ﬂows into the reservoir at time t. So
is the change in the amount of water in the reservoir between time
and time
.
N If 
is the concentration of the product of a chemical reaction at time t, then
the rate of reaction is the derivative 
. So
is the change in the concentration of C from time 
to time .
N If the mass of a rod measured from the left end to a point x is 
, then the 
linear density is 
. So
is the mass of the segment of the rod that lies between 
and 
.
N If the rate of growth of a population is 
, then
is the net change in population during the time period from 
to . (The popu-
lation increases when births happen and decreases when deaths occur. The net
change takes into account both births and deaths.)

N If 
is the cost of producing x units of a commodity, then the marginal cost is
the derivative 
. So
is the increase in cost when production is increased from 
units to
units.
N If an object moves along a straight line with position function 
, then its 
velocity is 
, so
is the net change of position, or displacement, of the particle during the time
period from 
to . In Section 5.1 we guessed that this was true for the case
where the object moves in the positive direction, but now we have proved that it
is always true.
N If we want to calculate the distance the object travels during that time interval,
we have to consider the intervals when 
(the particle moves to the right)
and also the intervals when 
(the particle moves to the left). In both cases
the distance is computed by integrating 
, the speed. Therefore
Figure 3 shows how both displacement and distance traveled can be interpreted
in terms of areas under a velocity curve.
N The acceleration of the object is 
, so
is the change in velocity from time 
to time .
EXAMPLE 6 A particle moves along a line so that its velocity at time is
(measured in meters per second).
(a) Find the displacement of the particle during the time period 
.
(b) Find the distance traveled during this time period.
SOLUTION
(a) By Equation 2, the displacement is
This means that the particle moved 4.5 m toward the left.

EXAMPLE 7 Figure 4 shows the power consumption in the city of San Francisco for a
day in September (P is measured in megawatts; t is measured in hours starting at mid-
night). Estimate the energy used on that day.
SOLUTION Power is the rate of change of energy: 
. So, by the Net Change 
Theorem,
is the total amount of energy used that day. We approximate the value of the integral
using the Midpoint Rule with 12 subintervals and 
:
The energy used was approximately 15,840 megawatt-hours.
M
How did we know what units to use for energy in Example 7? The integral 
is
deﬁned as the limit of sums of terms of the form 
. Now 
is measured in
megawatts and 
is measured in hours, so their product is measured in megawatt-hours.
The same is true of the limit. In general, the unit of measurement for 
is the prod-
uct of the unit for 
and the unit for x.

increasing, and concave upward. The points on this curve are
determined by ranking all households by income and then
computing the percentage of households whose income is less
than or equal to a given percentage of the total income of the
country. For example, the point 
is on the
Lorenz curve if the bottom 
of the households receive less
than or equal to 
of the total income. Absolute equality of
income distribution would occur if the bottom

We sometimes read that the inventors of calculus were Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and 
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). But we know that the basic ideas behind integration
were investigated 2500 years ago by ancient Greeks such as Eudoxus and Archimedes, and 
methods for ﬁnding tangents were pioneered by Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), Isaac Barrow
(1630–1677), and others. Barrow––who taught at Cambridge and was a major inﬂuence on 
Newton––was the ﬁrst to understand the inverse relationship between differentiation and integra-
tion. What Newton and Leibniz did was to use this relationship, in the form of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, in order to develop calculus into a systematic mathematical discipline. It 
is in this sense that Newton and Leibniz are credited with the invention of calculus.
Read about the contributions of these men in one or more of the given references and write a
report on one of the following three topics. You can include biographical details, but the main
thrust of your report should be a description, in some detail, of their methods and notations. In
particular, you should consult one of the sourcebooks, which give excerpts from the original
publications of Newton and Leibniz, translated from Latin to English.

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS
THE SUBSTITUTION RULE
Because of the Fundamental Theorem, it’s important to be able to ﬁnd antiderivatives. But
our antidifferentiation formulas don’t tell us how to evaluate integrals such as
To ﬁnd this integral we use the problem-solving strategy of introducing something extra.
Here the “something extra” is a new variable; we change from the variable x to a new vari-
able u. Suppose that we let be the quantity under the root sign in (1), 
. Then
the differential of is 
. Notice that if the 
in the notation for an integral were
to be interpreted as a differential, then the differential 
would occur in (1) and so, 
formally, without justifying our calculation, we could write
But now we can check that we have the correct answer by using the Chain Rule to differ-
entiate the ﬁnal function of Equation 2: 
In general, this method works whenever we have an integral that we can write in the
form

If we make the “change of variable” or “substitution” 
, then from Equation 3
we have

Thus we have proved the following rule.
THE SUBSTITUTION RULE If

is an interval and 
is continuous on , then
Notice that the Substitution Rule for integration was proved using the Chain Rule for
differentiation. Notice also that if

, so a way to remember the
Substitution Rule is to think of 
and 
in (4) as differentials.
Thus the Substitution Rule says: It is permissible to operate with dx and du after
integral signs as if they were differentials.
EXAMPLE 1 Find 
.
SOLUTION We make the substitution 
because its differential is 
,
which, apart from the constant factor 4, occurs in the integral. Thus, using 
and the Substitution Rule, we have
Notice that at the ﬁnal stage we had to return to the original variable .
M
The idea behind the Substitution Rule is to replace a relatively complicated integral 
by a simpler integral. This is accomplished by changing from the original variable 
to 
a new variable 
that is a function of . Thus, in Example 1, we replaced the integral
by the simpler integral 
.
The main challenge in using the Substitution Rule is to think of an appropriate substi-
tution. You should try to choose 
to be some function in the integrand whose differential
also occurs (except for a constant factor). This was the case in Example 1. If that is not

to be some complicated part of the integrand (perhaps the inner

unusual to guess wrong; if your ﬁrst guess doesn’t work, try another substitution.

The answer to Example 3 could be checked by differentiation, but instead let’s check

DEFINITE INTEGRALS
When evaluating a deﬁnite integral by substitution, two methods are possible. One method
is to evaluate the indeﬁnite integral ﬁrst and then use the Fundamental Theorem. For
instance, using the result of Example 2, we have 
Another method, which is usually preferable, is to change the limits of integration when
the variable is changed.

Theorem 7 is illustrated by Figure 4. For the case where 
is positive and even, part (a)
says that the area under 
from 
to 
is twice the area from 
to 
because of
symmetry. Recall that an integral 
can be expressed as the area above the -axis
and below 
minus the area below the axis and above the curve. Thus part (b) says
the integral is because the areas cancel.

Before you look at the solution of the following example, cover it up and ﬁrst try to solve
the problem yourself.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Let’s start by having a preliminary look at the ingredients of the function. What
happens to the ﬁrst factor, 
, when approaches ? The numerator approaches 
and the denominator approaches , so we have
and
The second factor approaches 
, which is . It’s not clear what happens to the
function as a whole. (One factor is becoming large while the other is becoming small.)
So how do we proceed?
One of the principles of problem solving is recognizing something familiar. Is there a
part of the function that reminds us of something we’ve seen before? Well, the integral
has as its upper limit of integration and that type of integral occurs in Part 1 of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
This suggests that differentiation might be involved.
Once we start thinking about differentiation, the denominator 
reminds us of
something else that should be familiar: One of the forms of the deﬁnition of the deriva-
tive in Chapter 2 is
and with 
this becomes
So what is the function 
in our situation? Notice that if we deﬁne
then 
. What about the factor in the numerator? That’s just a red herring, so
let’s factor it out and put together the calculation:

In this chapter we explore some of the applications of the deﬁnite integral by using it 
to compute areas between curves, volumes of solids, and the work done by a varying
force. The common theme is the following general method, which is similar to the one
we used to ﬁnd areas under curves: We break up a quantity 
into a large number of
small parts. We next approximate each small part by a quantity of the form 
and
thus approximate 
by a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit and express 
as an
integral. Finally we evaluate the integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 
or the Midpoint Rule.

AREAS BETWEEN CURVES
In Chapter 5 we deﬁned and calculated areas of regions that lie under the graphs of 
functions. Here we use integrals to ﬁnd areas of regions that lie between the graphs of two
functions.
Consider the region 
that lies between two curves 
and 
and be-
tween the vertical lines 
and 
, where 
and 
are continuous functions and
for all in 
. (See Figure 1.)
Just as we did for areas under curves in Section 5.1, we divide S into n strips of equal
width and then we approximate the ith strip by a rectangle with base 
and height
. (See Figure 2. If we like, we could take all of the sample points to be right
endpoints, in which case 
.) The Riemann sum
is therefore an approximation to what we intuitively think of as the area of S.
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
. Therefore we deﬁne
the area
of the region 
as the limiting value of the sum of the areas of these approxi-
mating rectangles.
We recognize the limit in (1) as the deﬁnite integral of 
. Therefore we have the fol-
lowing formula for area.
The area A of the region bounded by the curves 
, and the
lines 
,
, where 
and are continuous and 
for all in 
, is
Notice that in the special case where 
,
is the region under the graph of 
and our general deﬁnition of area (1) reduces to our previous deﬁnition (Deﬁnition 2 in
Section 5.1).

In the case where both 
and are positive, you can see from Figure 3 why (2) is true:
EXAMPLE 1 Find the area of the region bounded above by 
, bounded below by
, and bounded on the sides by x  0 and x  1.
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 4. The upper boundary curve is 
and the
lower boundary curve is 
. So we use the area formula (2) with 
,
,
and 
:
M
In Figure 4 we drew a typical approximating rectangle with width 
as a reminder of
the procedure by which the area is deﬁned in (1). In general, when we set up an integral
for an area, it’s helpful to sketch the region to identify the top curve 
, the bottom curve
, and a typical approximating rectangle as in Figure 5. Then the area of a typical rect-
angle is 
and the equation
summarizes the procedure of adding (in a limiting sense) the areas of all the typical 
rectangles.
Notice that in Figure 5 the left-hand boundary reduces to a point, whereas in Figure 3
the right-hand boundary reduces to a point. In the next example both of the side bound-
aries reduce to a point, so the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a and b.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the area of the region enclosed by the parabolas 
and
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst ﬁnd the points of intersection of the parabolas by solving their equa-
tions simultaneously. This gives 
, or 
. Thus 
,
so 
or 1. The points of intersection are 
and 
.
We see from Figure 6 that the top and bottom boundaries are
and
The area of a typical rectangle is
and the region lies between 
and 
. So the total area is

Sometimes it’s difﬁcult, or even impossible, to ﬁnd the points of intersection of two
curves exactly. As shown in the following example, we can use a graphing calculator or
computer to ﬁnd approximate values for the intersection points and then proceed as before.
EXAMPLE 3 Find the approximate area of the region bounded by the curves
and 
SOLUTION If we were to try to ﬁnd the exact intersection points, we would have to solve
the equation
This looks like a very difﬁcult equation to solve exactly (in fact, it’s impossible), so
instead we use a graphing device to draw the graphs of the two curves in Figure 7. One
intersection point is the origin. We zoom in toward the other point of intersection and
ﬁnd that 
. (If greater accuracy is required, we could use Newton’s method or a
rootﬁnder, if available on our graphing device.) Thus an approximation to the area
between the curves is
To integrate the ﬁrst term we use the subsitution 
. Then

EXAMPLE 4 Figure 8 shows velocity curves for two cars, A and B, that start side by side
and move along the same road. What does the area between the curves represent? Use
the Midpoint Rule to estimate it.
SOLUTION We know from Section 5.4 that the area under the velocity curve A represents
the distance traveled by car A during the ﬁrst 16 seconds. Similarly, the area under curve
B is the distance traveled by car B during that time period. So the area between these
curves, which is the difference of the areas under the curves, is the distance between the
cars after 16 seconds. We read the velocities from the graph and convert them to feet per
second

SOLUTION By solving the two equations we ﬁnd that the points of intersection are

We could have found the area in Example 6 by integrating with respect to x instead of
y, but the calculation is much more involved. It would have meant splitting the region in
two and computing the areas labeled

in Figure 14. The method we used in
Example 6 is much easier.

VOLUMES
In trying to ﬁnd the volume of a solid we face the same type of problem as in ﬁnding areas.
We have an intuitive idea of what volume means, but we must make this idea precise by
using calculus to give an exact deﬁnition of volume.
We start with a simple type of solid called a cylinder (or, more precisely, a right cylin-
der). As illustrated in Figure 1(a), a cylinder is bounded by a plane region 
, called the
base, and a congruent region 
in a parallel plane. The cylinder consists of all points on
line segments that are perpendicular to the base and join 
to 
. If the area of the base is
and the height of the cylinder (the distance from 
to 
) is , then the volume 
of the
cylinder is deﬁned as
In particular, if the base is a circle with radius , then the cylinder is a circular cylinder with
volume 
[see Figure 1(b)], and if the base is a rectangle with length and width
, then the cylinder is a rectangular box (also called a rectangular parallelepiped) with
volume 
[see Figure 1(c)].
For a solid S that isn’t a cylinder we ﬁrst “cut” S into pieces and approximate each piece
by a cylinder. We estimate the volume of S by adding the volumes of the cylinders. We
arrive at the exact volume of S through a limiting process in which the number of pieces
becomes large.
We start by intersecting S with a plane and obtaining a plane region that is called a
cross-section of 
Let 
be the area of the cross-section of 
in a plane 
perpen-
dicular to the -axis and passing through the point , where 
. (See Figure 2.
Think of slicing with a knife through and computing the area of this slice.) The cross-
sectional area 
will vary as increases from 
to .

CHAPTER 6 APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION

Let’s divide S into n “slabs” of equal width 
by using the planes 
,
, . . . to slice
the solid. (Think of slicing a loaf of bread.) If we choose sample points 
in 
, we
can approximate the th slab 
(the part of 
that lies between the planes 
and 
) by
a cylinder with base area 
and “height”
. (See Figure 3.)
FIGURE 3
The volume of this cylinder is 
, so an approximation to our intuitive concep-
tion of the volume of the th slab 
is 
Adding the volumes of these slabs, we get an approximation to the total volume (that is,
what we think of intuitively as the volume):
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
. (Think of the slices as
becoming thinner and thinner.) Therefore, we deﬁne the volume as the limit of these sums
as 
. But we recognize the limit of Riemann sums as a deﬁnite integral and so we
have the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION OF VOLUME Let 
be a solid that lies between 
and 
. If the
cross-sectional area of 
in the plane 
, through x and perpendicular to the x-axis,
is 
, where 
is a continuous function, then the volume of 
is
When we use the volume formula 
, it is important to remember that 
is the area of a moving cross-section obtained by slicing through 
perpendicular to
the -axis.
Notice that, for a cylinder, the cross-sectional area is constant:
for all . So our
deﬁnition of volume gives 
; this agrees with the formula 
EXAMPLE 1 Show that the volume of a sphere of radius is 
.
SOLUTION If we place the sphere so that its center is at the origin (see Figure 4), then the
plane

Figure 5 illustrates the deﬁnition of volume when the solid is a sphere with radius 
. From the result of Example 1, we know that the volume of the sphere is
. Here the slabs are circular cylinders, or disks, and the three parts of Fig-
ure 5 show the geometric interpretations of the Riemann sums
when n  5, 10, and 20 if we choose the sample points 
to be the midpoints . Notice
that as we increase the number of approximating cylinders, the corresponding Riemann
sums become closer to the true volume.

ing a typical approximating cylinder.

solid shown in Figure 6(b). When we slice through the point x, we get a disk with radius

SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 7(a) and the resulting solid is shown in
Figure 7(b). Because the region is rotated about the y-axis, it makes sense to slice the
solid perpendicular to the y-axis and therefore to integrate with respect to y. If we slice

N Did we get a reasonable answer in 
Example 2? As a check on our work, let’s 
replace the given region by a square with base
and height . If we rotate this square, 
we get a cylinder with radius , height , and
volume 
. We computed that the
given solid has half this volume. That seems
about right.

SOLUTION The curves 
and 
intersect at the points 
and 
. The region
between them, the solid of rotation, and a cross-section perpendicular to the -axis are
shown in Figure 8. A cross-section in the plane 
has the shape of a washer (an annular
ring) with inner radius 
and outer radius , so we ﬁnd the cross-sectional area by sub-
tracting the area of the inner circle from the area of the outer circle:
Therefore we have

CHAPTER 6 APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION

TEC

The cross-sectional area is
and so the volume of 
is
M
The solids in Examples 1–5 are all called solids of revolution because they are obtained
by revolving a region about a line. In general, we calculate the volume of a solid of revo-
lution by using the basic deﬁning formula
and we ﬁnd the cross-sectional area 
or 
in one of the following ways:
N
If the cross-section is a disk (as in Examples 1–3), we ﬁnd the radius of the
disk (in terms of x or y) and use
N
If the cross-section is a washer (as in Examples 4 and 5), we ﬁnd the inner
radius 
and outer radius 
from a sketch (as in Figures 8, 9, and 10) and
compute the area of the washer by subtracting the area of the inner disk from
the area of the outer disk:
The next example gives a further illustration of the procedure.

The volume is

We now ﬁnd the volumes of three solids that are not solids of revolution.

sections perpendicular to the base are equilateral triangles. Find the volume of the solid.

CHAPTER 6 APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
Visual 6.2C shows how the solid 
in Figure 12 is generated.

Since 
lies on the circle, we have 
and so the base of the triangle
is 
. Since the triangle is equilateral, we see from Figure 13(c) that its 
height is 
. The cross-sectional area is therefore
and the volume of the solid is
M
EXAMPLE 8 Find the volume of a pyramid whose base is a square with side 
and
whose height is .
SOLUTION We place the origin 
at the vertex of the pyramid and the -axis along its cen-
tral axis as in Figure 14. Any plane 
that passes through and is perpendicular to the 
-axis intersects the pyramid in a square with side of length , say. We can express in
terms of by observing from the similar triangles in Figure 15 that
and so 
. [Another method is to observe that the line 
has slope 
and
so its equation is 
.] Thus the cross-sectional area is
The pyramid lies between 
and 
, so its volume is
M
We didn’t need to place the vertex of the pyramid at the origin in Example 8.
We did so merely to make the equations simple. If, instead, we had placed the center of the
base at the origin and the vertex on the positive -axis, as in Figure 16, you can verify that

of 30 along a diameter of the cylinder. Find the volume of the wedge.
SOLUTION If we place the -axis along the diameter where the planes meet, then the 
base of the solid is a semicircle with equation 
,
. A cross-
section perpendicular to the -axis at a distance from the origin is a triangle 
,
as shown in Figure 17, whose base is

VOLUMES BY CYLINDRICAL SHELLS
Some volume problems are very difﬁcult to handle by the methods of the preceding sec-
tion. For instance, let’s consider the problem of ﬁnding the volume of the solid obtained
by rotating about the -axis the region bounded by 
and 
. (See Figure 1.)
If we slice perpendicular to the y-axis, we get a washer. But to compute the inner radius
and the outer radius of the washer, we would have to solve the cubic equation
for x in terms of y; that’s not easy.
Fortunately, there is a method, called the method of cylindrical shells, that is easier to
use in such a case. Figure 2 shows a cylindrical shell with inner radius , outer radius ,
and height . Its volume 
is calculated by subtracting the volume 
of the inner cylinder
from the volume 
of the outer cylinder:
If we let 
(the thickness of the shell) and 
(the average radius
of the shell), then this formula for the volume of a cylindrical shell becomes
and it can be remembered as
Now let 
be the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region bounded by

We divide the interval 
into n subintervals 
of equal width 
and let 
be
the midpoint of the ith subinterval. If the rectangle with base 
and height 
is
rotated about the y-axis, then the result is a cylindrical shell with average radius , height
, and thickness 
(see Figure 4), so by Formula 1 its volume is
Therefore an approximation to the volume 
of 
is given by the sum of the volumes of
these shells:
This approximation appears to become better as 
. But, from the deﬁnition of an inte-
gral, we know that
Thus the following appears plausible:
The volume of the solid in Figure 3, obtained by rotating about the y-axis the
region under the curve 
from a to b, is
The argument using cylindrical shells makes Formula 2 seem reasonable, but later we
will be able to prove it (see Exercise 67 in Section 7.1).
The best way to remember Formula 2 is to think of a typical shell, cut and ﬂattened as
in Figure 5, with radius x, circumference 
, height 
, and thickness 
or 
:
This type of reasoning will be helpful in other situations, such as when we rotate about
lines other than the y-axis.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region
bounded by 
and

SOLUTION From the sketch in Figure 6 we see that a typical shell has radius x, circumfer-
ence

Comparing the solution of Example 1 with the remarks at the beginning of this
section, we see that the method of cylindrical shells is much easier than the washer method
for this problem. We did not have to ﬁnd the coordinates of the local maximum and we did
not have to solve the equation of the curve for in terms of . However, in other examples
the methods of the preceding section may be easier.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the
region between 
and 
.
SOLUTION The region and a typical shell are shown in Figure 8. We see that the shell has
radius x, circumference 
, and height 
. So the volume is
M
As the following example shows, the shell method works just as well if we rotate about
the x-axis. We simply have to draw a diagram to identify the radius and height of a shell.
EXAMPLE 3 Use cylindrical shells to ﬁnd the volume of the solid obtained by rotating
about the -axis the region under the curve 
from 0 to 1.
SOLUTION This problem was solved using disks in Example 2 in Section 6.2. To use shells
we relabel the curve 
(in the ﬁgure in that example) as 
in Figure 9. For
rotation about the x-axis we see that a typical shell has radius y, circumference 
, and
height 
. So the volume is
In this problem the disk method was simpler.

WORK
The term work is used in everyday language to mean the total amount of effort required to
perform a task. In physics it has a technical meaning that depends on the idea of a force.
Intuitively, you can think of a force as describing a push or pull on an object—for example,
a horizontal push of a book across a table or the downward pull of the earth’s gravity on a
ball. In general, if an object moves along a straight line with position function 
, then
the force F on the object (in the same direction) is deﬁned by Newton’s Second Law of
Motion as the product of its mass 
and its acceleration:
In the SI metric system, the mass is measured in kilograms (kg), the displacement in
meters (m), the time in seconds (s), and the force in newtons (
). Thus a force
of 1 N acting on a mass of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 m
s . In the US Customary
system, the fundamental unit is chosen to be the unit of force, which is the pound.
In the case of constant acceleration, the force 
is also constant and the work done is
deﬁned to be the product of the force 
and the distance 
that the object moves:
If 
is measured in newtons and in meters, then the unit for 
is a newton-meter, which
is called a joule (J). If 
is measured in pounds and in feet, then the unit for 
is a foot-
pound (ft-lb), which is about 1.36 J.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) How much work is done in lifting a 1.2-kg book off the ﬂoor to put it on a desk that
is 0.7 m high? Use the fact that the acceleration due to gravity is 
m
s .
(b) How much work is done in lifting a 20-lb weight 6 ft off the ground?
SOLUTION
(a) The force exerted is equal and opposite to that exerted by gravity, so Equation 1
gives
and then Equation 2 gives the work done as
(b) Here the force is given as 
lb, so the work done is
Notice that in part (b), unlike part (a), we did not have to multiply by because we
were given the weight (which is a force) and not the mass of the object.
M
Equation 2 deﬁnes work as long as the force is constant, but what happens if the force
is variable? Let’s suppose that the object moves along the -axis in the positive direction,
from 
to 
, and at each point between and a force 
acts on the object,
where is a continuous function. We divide the interval 
into n subintervals with end-
points 
and equal width 
. We choose a sample point 
in the th sub-
interval 
. Then the force at that point is 
. If 
is large, then 
is small, and

since

don’t change very much over the interval

In other words,
is almost constant on the interval and so the work 
that is done in mov-
ing the particle from

Thus we can approximate the total work by
It seems that this approximation becomes better as we make larger. Therefore we deﬁne
the work done in moving the object from a to b as the limit of this quantity as 
.
Since the right side of (3) is a Riemann sum, we recognize its limit as being a deﬁnite inte-
gral and so

pounds acts on it. How much work is done in moving it from 
to

SOLUTION
The work done is 
ft-lb.

In the next example we use a law from physics: Hooke’s Law states that the force
required to maintain a spring stretched 
units beyond its natural length is proportional 
to :
where 
is a positive constant (called the spring constant). Hooke’s Law holds provided
that is not too large (see Figure 1).
EXAMPLE 3 A force of 40 N is required to hold a spring that has been stretched from
its natural length of 10 cm to a length of 15 cm. How much work is done in stretching
the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm?
SOLUTION According to Hooke’s Law, the force required to hold the spring stretched 
meters beyond its natural length is 
. When the spring is stretched from 10 cm
to 15 cm, the amount stretched is cm
m. This means that 
, so
Thus 
and the work done in stretching the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm is

EXAMPLE 4 A 200-lb cable is 100 ft long and hangs vertically from the top of a tall
building. How much work is required to lift the cable to the top of the building?
SOLUTION Here we don’t have a formula for the force function, but we can use an argu-
ment similar to the one that led to Deﬁnition 4.
Let’s place the origin at the top of the building and the -axis pointing downward as
in Figure 2. We divide the cable into small parts with length 
. If 
is a point in the
such interval, then all points in the interval are lifted by approximately the same
amount, namely 
. The cable weighs 2 pounds per foot, so the weight of the 
part is
. Thus the work done on the 
part, in foot-pounds, is 
We get the total work done by adding all these approximations and letting the number
of parts become large (so 
):

EXAMPLE 5 A tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with height 10 m and base
radius 4 m. It is ﬁlled with water to a height of 8 m. Find the work required to empty 
the tank by pumping all of the water to the top of the tank. (The density of water is
1000 kg
m .)
SOLUTION Let’s measure depths from the top of the tank by introducing a vertical coordi-
nate line as in Figure 3. The water extends from a depth of 2 m to a depth of 10 m and
so we divide the interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints 
and
choose 
in the th subinterval. This divides the water into 
layers. The th layer is
approximated by a circular cylinder with radius 
and height 
. We can compute 
from similar triangles, using Figure 4, as follows:
Thus an approximation to the volume of the th layer of water is
and so its mass is
The force required to raise this layer must overcome the force of gravity and so
Each particle in the layer must travel a distance of approximately
. The work
done to
raise this layer to the top is approximately the product of the force
and the distance

AVERAGE VALUE OF A FUNCTION

But how do we compute the average temperature during a day if inﬁnitely many tempera-
ture readings are possible? Figure 1 shows the graph of a temperature function 
, where
is measured in hours and 
in C, and a guess at the average temperature,

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is a consequence of the Mean Value Theorem
for derivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The proof is outlined in Exer-
cise 23.
The geometric interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is that, for posi-
tive functions , there is a number such that the rectangle with base 
and height 
has the same area as the region under the graph of

Because of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can integrate a function if we know
an antiderivative, that is, an indeﬁnite integral. We summarize here the most important
integrals that we have learned so far.
In this chapter we develop techniques for using these basic integration formulas to obtain
indeﬁnite integrals of more complicated functions. We learned the most important method of
integration, the Substitution Rule, in Section 5.5. The other general technique, integration by
parts, is presented in Section 7.1. Then we learn methods that are special to particular classes
of functions, such as trigonometric functions and rational functions.
Integration is not as straightforward as differentiation; there are no rules that absolutely
guarantee obtaining an indeﬁnite integral of a function. Therefore we discuss a strategy for
integration in Section 7.5.

INTEGRATION BY PARTS
Every differentiation rule has a corresponding integration rule. For instance, the Substi-
tution Rule for integration corresponds to the Chain Rule for differentiation. The rule that
corresponds to the Product Rule for differentiation is called the rule for integration by
parts.
The Product Rule states that if 
and are differentiable functions, then
In the notation for indeﬁnite integrals this equation becomes
or
We can rearrange this equation as
Formula 1 is called the formula for integration by parts. It is perhaps easier to remem-
ber in the following notation. Let 
and 
. Then the differentials are
and 
, so, by the Substitution Rule, the formula for integration
by parts becomes

Our aim in using integration by parts is to obtain a simpler integral than the one
we started with. Thus in Example 1 we started with 
and expressed it in terms
of the simpler integral 
. If we had instead chosen 
and 
, then
and 
, so integration by parts gives
Although this is true,
is a more difﬁcult integral than the one we started with.
In general, when deciding on a choice for 
and 
, we usually try to choose 
to
be a function that becomes simpler when differentiated (or at least not more complicated)
as long as 
can be readily integrated to give .

Then
Integrating by parts, we get
Integration by parts is effective in this example because the derivative of the function

Integration by parts gives
The integral that we obtained,

TRIGONOMETRIC INTEGRALS
In this section we use trigonometric identities to integrate certain combinations of trigo-
nometric functions. We start with powers of sine and cosine.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Simply substituting 
isn’t helpful, since then 
. In order
to integrate powers of cosine, we would need an extra 
factor. Similarly, a power of
sine would require an extra 
factor. Thus here we can separate one cosine factor and
convert the remaining 
factor to an expression involving sine using the identity
:
We can then evaluate the integral by substituting 
, so 
and
M
In general, we try to write an integrand involving powers of sine and cosine in a form
where we have only one sine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of
cosine) or only one cosine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of sine).
The identity 
enables us to convert back and forth between even powers
of sine and cosine.
EXAMPLE 2 Find 
.
SOLUTION We could convert 
to 
, but we would be left with an expression in
terms of 
with no extra 
factor. Instead, we separate a single sine factor and
rewrite the remaining 
factor in terms of

In the preceding examples, an odd power of sine or cosine enabled us to separate a 
single factor and convert the remaining even power. If the integrand contains even powers
of both sine and cosine, this strategy fails. In this case, we can take advantage of the fol-
lowing half-angle identities (see Equations 17b and 17a in Appendix D):
and
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate

SOLUTION If we write 
, the integral is no simpler to evaluate. Using the
half-angle formula for

Notice that we mentally made the substitution 
when integrating

method for evaluating this integral was given in Exercise 43 in Section 7.1.

EXAMPLE 4 Find

SOLUTION We could evaluate this integral using the reduction formula for 
(Equation 7.1.7) together with Example 3 (as in Exercise 43 in Section 7.1), but a better
method is to write 
and use a half-angle formula:
Since 
occurs, we must use another half-angle formula
This gives

STRATEGY FOR EVALUATING 
(a) If the power of cosine is odd 
, save one cosine factor and use
to express the remaining factors in terms of sine:
Then substitute 
.
(b) If the power of sine is odd 
, save one sine factor and use
to express the remaining factors in terms of cosine:
Then substitute 
. [Note that if the powers of both sine and cosine are
odd, either (a) or (b) can be used.]
(c) If the powers of both sine and cosine are even, use the half-angle identities
It is sometimes helpful to use the identity
We can use a similar strategy to evaluate integrals of the form

factor and convert the remaining (even)
power of secant to an expression involving tangent using the identity

Or, since

SOLUTION If we separate a 
factor, as in the preceding example, we are left with 
a 
factor, which isn’t easily converted to tangent. However, if we separate a
factor, we can convert the remaining power of tangent to an expression
involving only secant using the identity 
. We can then evaluate the
integral by substituting 
, so

The preceding examples demonstrate strategies for evaluating integrals of the form
for two cases, which we summarize here.

(a) If the power of secant is even 
, save a factor of 
and use
to express the remaining factors in terms of 
:
Then substitute

(b) If the power of tangent is odd 
, save a factor of 
and
use 
to express the remaining factors in terms of 
:
Then substitute 
.
For other cases, the guidelines are not as clear-cut. We may need to use identities, inte-
gration by parts, and occasionally a little ingenuity. We will sometimes need to be able to

ply numerator and denominator by

TRIGONOMETRIC SUBSTITUTION
In ﬁnding the area of a circle or an ellipse, an integral of the form 
arises,
where 
. If it were 
, the substitution 
would be effective
but, as it stands,
is more difﬁcult. If we change the variable from to 
by
the substitution 
, then the identity 
allows us to get rid of the
root sign because
Notice the difference between the substitution 
(in which the new variable is
a function of the old one) and the substitution 
(the old variable is a function of
the new one).
In general we can make a substitution of the form 
by using the Substitution
Rule in reverse. To make our calculations simpler, we assume that has an inverse func-
tion; that is,
is one-to-one. In this case, if we replace by and by in the Substitution
Rule (Equation 5.5.4), we obtain
This kind of substitution is called inverse substitution.
We can make the inverse substitution 
provided that it deﬁnes a one-to-one
function. This can be accomplished by restricting 
to lie in the interval 
.
In the following table we list trigonometric substitutions that are effective for the given
radical expressions because of the speciﬁed trigonometric identities. In each case the restric-
tion on 
is imposed to ensure that the function that deﬁnes the substitution is one-to-one.
(These are the same intervals used in Section 1.6 in deﬁning the inverse functions.)

Since this is an indeﬁnite integral, we must return to the original variable . This can be
done either by using trigonometric identities to express 
in terms of 
or 
by drawing a diagram, as in Figure 1, where 
is interpreted as an angle of a right tri-
angle. Since
, we label the opposite side and the hypotenuse as having lengths
and . Then the Pythagorean Theorem gives the length of the adjacent side as

As Example 5 illustrates, hyperbolic substitutions can be used in place of trigo-
nometric substitutions and sometimes they lead to simpler answers. But we usually use
trigonometric substitutions because trigonometric identities are more familiar than hyper-
bolic identities.

INTEGRATION OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS BY PARTIAL FRACTIONS
In this section we show how to integrate any rational function (a ratio of polynomials) by
expressing it as a sum of simpler fractions, called partial fractions, that we already know
how to integrate. To illustrate the method, observe that by taking the fractions 
and 
to a common denominator we obtain
If we now reverse the procedure, we see how to integrate the function on the right side of

this equation:
To see how the method of partial fractions works in general, let’s consider a rational
function
where 
and 
are polynomials. It’s possible to express 
as a sum of simpler fractions
provided that the degree of 
is less than the degree of . Such a rational function is called
proper. Recall that if
where 
, then the degree of 
is and we write 
.
If 
is improper, that is,
, then we must take the preliminary step 
of dividing 
into 
(by long division) until a remainder 
is obtained such that
. The division statement is
where 
and 
are also polynomials.
As the following example illustrates, sometimes this preliminary step is all that is
required.
EXAMPLE 1 Find 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator,
we ﬁrst perform the long division. This enables us to write
M
The next step is to factor the denominator 
as far as possible. It can be shown that
any polynomial 
can be factored as a product of linear factors (of the form 
) 
and irreducible quadratic factors (of the form 
, where 
). For
instance, if 
, we could factor it as
The third step is to express the proper rational function 
(from Equation 1) as
a sum of partial fractions of the form

A theorem in algebra guarantees that it is always possible to do this. We explain the details
for the four cases that occur.
CASE I
N The denominator Q(x) is a product of distinct linear factors.
This means that we can write
where no factor is repeated (and no factor is a constant multiple of another). In this case
the partial fraction theorem states that there exist constants 
such that
These constants can be determined as in the following example.
EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, we
don’t need to divide. We factor the denominator as
Since the denominator has three distinct linear factors, the partial fraction decomposition
of the integrand (2) has the form
To determine the values of ,
, and , we multiply both sides of this equation by the
product of the denominators,
, obtaining
Expanding the right side of Equation 4 and writing it in the standard form for polyno-
mials, we get
The polynomials in Equation 5 are identical, so their coefﬁcients must be equal. The
coefﬁcient of 
on the right side,
, must equal the coefﬁcient of 
on the
left side—namely, 1. Likewise, the coefﬁcients of are equal and the constant terms are
equal. This gives the following system of equations for ,
, and :

Solving, we get

In integrating the middle term we have made the mental substitution 
, which
gives 
and 
.
M
We can use an alternative method to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients 
,
, and 
in 
Example 2. Equation 4 is an identity; it is true for every value of . Let’s choose values of
that simplify the equation. If we put 
in Equation 4, then the second and third terms
on the right side vanish and the equation then becomes 
, or 
. Likewise,
gives 
and 
gives 
, so 
and 
. (You may object
that Equation 3 is not valid for 
, , or 
, so why should Equation 4 be valid for those
values? In fact, Equation 4 is true for all values of , even 
, , and 
. See Exercise 69
for the reason.)

, where 
.
SOLUTION The method of partial fractions gives
and therefore
Using the method of the preceding note, we put 
in this equation and get
, so 
. If we put 
, we get 
, so 
.
Thus
Since 
, we can write the integral as
See Exercises 55–56 for ways of using Formula 6.

fractions in Equations 2 and 7, the expression for

has a partial fraction decomposition of the form
The term given in (9) can be integrated by completing the square and using the formula

SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is not less than the degree of the denominator,
we ﬁrst divide and obtain
Notice that the quadratic 
is irreducible because its discriminant is
. This means it can’t be factored, so we don’t need to use the 
partial fraction technique.
To integrate the given function we complete the square in the denominator:
This suggests that we make the substitution 
. Then,
and
, so

Example 6 illustrates the general procedure for integrating a partial fraction of
the form
We complete the square in the denominator and then make a substitution that brings the

Then the ﬁrst integral is a logarithm and the second is expressed in terms of

ate substitutions. In particular, when an integrand contains an expression of the form

may be effective. Other instances appear in the

STRATEGY FOR INTEGRATION
As we have seen, integration is more challenging than differentiation. In ﬁnding the deriv-
ative of a function it is obvious which differentiation formula we should apply. But it may
not be obvious which technique we should use to integrate a given function.
Until now individual techniques have been applied in each section. For instance, we
usually used substitution in Exercises 5.5, integration by parts in Exercises 7.1, and partial
fractions in Exercises 7.4. But in this section we present a collection of miscellaneous inte-
grals in random order and the main challenge is to recognize which technique or formula
to use. No hard and fast rules can be given as to which method applies in a given situation,
but we give some advice on strategy that you may ﬁnd useful.
A prerequisite for strategy selection is a knowledge of the basic integration formulas.
In the following table we have collected the integrals from our previous list together with
several additional formulas that we have learned in this chapter. Most of them should be
memorized. It is useful to know them all, but the ones marked with an asterisk need not be 
7.5

memorized since they are easily derived. Formula 19 can be avoided by using partial frac-
tions, and trigonometric substitutions can be used in place of Formula 20.

Once you are armed with these basic integration formulas, if you don’t immediately see
how to attack a given integral, you might try the following four-step strategy.
1. Simplify the Integrand if Possible Sometimes the use of algebraic manipula-
tion or trigonometric identities will simplify the integrand and make the method of
integration obvious. Here are some examples:

CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION

2. Look for an Obvious Substitution Try to ﬁnd some function 
in the
integrand whose differential 
also occurs, apart from a constant fac-
tor. For instance, in the integral
we notice that if 
, then 
. Therefore we use the substitu-
tion 
instead of the method of partial fractions.
3. Classify the Integrand According to Its Form If Steps 1 and 2 have not led
to the solution, then we take a look at the form of the integrand 
.
(a) Trigonometric functions. If 
is a product of powers of 
and 
,
of 
and 
, or of 
and 
, then we use the substitutions recom-
mended in Section 7.2.
(b) Rational functions. If 
is a rational function, we use the procedure of Sec-
tion 7.4 involving partial fractions.
(c) Integration by parts. If 
is a product of a power of (or a polynomial) and
a transcendental function (such as a trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic
function), then we try integration by parts, choosing and 
according to the
advice given in Section 7.1. If you look at the functions in Exercises 7.1, you
will see that most of them are the type just described.
(d) Radicals. Particular kinds of substitutions are recommended when certain
radicals appear.
(i) If 
occurs, we use a trigonometric substitution according to
the table in Section 7.3.
(ii) If 
occurs, we use the rationalizing substitution 
.
More generally, this sometimes works for 
.
4. Try Again If the ﬁrst three steps have not produced the answer, remember that
there are basically only two methods of integration: substitution and parts.
(a) Try substitution. Even if no substitution is obvious (Step 2), some inspiration
or ingenuity (or even desperation) may suggest an appropriate substitution.
(b) Try parts. Although integration by parts is used most of the time on products
of the form described in Step 3(c), it is sometimes effective on single func-
tions. Looking at Section 7.1, we see that it works on 
,
, and 
,
and these are all inverse functions.
(c) Manipulate the integrand. Algebraic manipulations (perhaps rationalizing the
denominator or using trigonometric identities) may be useful in transforming
the integral into an easier form. These manipulations may be more substantial
than in Step 1 and may involve some ingenuity. Here is an example:
(d) Relate the problem to previous problems. When you have built up some expe-
rience in integration, you may be able to use a method on a given integral that
is similar to a method you have already used on a previous integral. Or you
may even be able to express the given integral in terms of a previous one. For

instance,
is a challenging integral, but if we make use of the iden-
tity 
, we can write
and if 
has previously been evaluated (see Example 8 in Section 7.2),
then that calculation can be used in the present problem.
(e) Use several methods. Sometimes two or three methods are required to evalu-
ate an integral. The evaluation could involve several successive substitutions 
of different types, or it might combine integration by parts with one or more
substitutions.
In the following examples we indicate a method of attack but do not fully work out the
integral.
EXAMPLE 1
In Step 1 we rewrite the integral:
The integral is now of the form 
with 
odd, so we can use the advice in
Section 7.2.
Alternatively, if in Step 1 we had written
then we could have continued as follows with the substitution 
:

EXAMPLE 2
According to (ii) in Step 3(d), we substitute

EXAMPLE 3
No algebraic simpliﬁcation or substitution is obvious, so Steps 1 and 2 don’t apply here.
The integrand is a rational function so we apply the procedure of Section 7.4, remember-
ing that the ﬁrst step is to divide.
M
EXAMPLE 4
Here Step 2 is all that is needed. We substitute 
because its differential is
, which occurs in the integral.
M
EXAMPLE 5
Although the rationalizing substitution
works here [(ii) in Step 3(d)], it leads to a very complicated rational function. An easier
method is to do some algebraic manipulation [either as Step 1 or as Step 4(c)]. Multiply-
ing numerator and denominator by 
, we have
M
CAN WE INTEGRATE ALL CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS?
The question arises: Will our strategy for integration enable us to ﬁnd the integral of every
continuous function? For example, can we use it to evaluate 
? The answer is No, at
least not in terms of the functions that we are familiar with.
The functions that we have been dealing with in this book are called elementary func-
tions. These are the polynomials, rational functions, power functions 
, exponential
functions 
, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions,
hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, and all functions that can be obtained from
these by the ﬁve operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and compo-
sition. For instance, the function
is an elementary function.
If 
is an elementary function, then 
is an elementary function but 
need not
be an elementary function. Consider

is continuous, its integral exists,

has an antiderivative , but it has been proved that 
is not an elemen-
tary function. This means that no matter how hard we try, we will never succeed in evalu-
ating 
in terms of the functions we know. (In Chapter 11, however, we will see how
to express 
as an inﬁnite series.) The same can be said of the following integrals:
In fact, the majority of elementary functions don’t have elementary antiderivatives. You
may be assured, though, that the integrals in the following exercises are all elementary
functions.

INTEGRATION USING TABLES AND COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS
In this section we describe how to use tables and computer algebra systems to integrate
functions that have elementary antiderivatives. You should bear in mind, though, that even
the most powerful computer algebra systems can’t ﬁnd explicit formulas for the antideriv-
atives of functions like 
or the other functions described at the end of Section 7.5.
TABLES OF INTEGRALS
Tables of indeﬁnite integrals are very useful when we are confronted by an integral that is
difﬁcult to evaluate by hand and we don’t have access to a computer algebra system. A rel-
atively brief table of 120 integrals, categorized by form, is provided on the Reference Pages
at the back of the book. More extensive tables are available in CRC Standard Mathe-
matical Tables and Formulae, 31st ed. by Daniel Zwillinger (Boca Raton, FL: CRC 
Press, 2002) (709 entries) or in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik’s Table of Integrals, Series, and
Products, 6e (San Diego: Academic Press, 2000), which contains hundreds of pages of
integrals. It should be remembered, however, that integrals do not often occur in exactly
the form listed in a table. Usually we need to use substitution or algebraic manipulation to
transform a given integral into one of the forms in the table.

, we see
that the closest entry is number 34:
This is not exactly what we have, but we will be able to use it if we ﬁrst make the substi-
tution 
:
Then we use Formula 34 with

COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS
We have seen that the use of tables involves matching the form of the given integrand with
the forms of the integrands in the tables. Computers are particularly good at matching pat-
terns. And just as we used substitutions in conjunction with tables, a CAS can perform sub-
stitutions that transform a given integral into one that occurs in its stored formulas. So it
isn’t surprising that computer algebra systems excel at integration. That doesn’t mean that
integration by hand is an obsolete skill. We will see that a hand computation sometimes
produces an indeﬁnite integral in a form that is more convenient than a machine answer.
To begin, let’s see what happens when we ask a machine to integrate the relatively 
simple function 
. Using the substitution 
, an easy calculation
by hand gives

whereas Derive, Mathematica, and Maple all return the answer
The ﬁrst thing to notice is that computer algebra systems omit the constant of integra-
tion. In other words, they produce a particular antiderivative, not the most general one.
Therefore, when making use of a machine integration, we might have to add a constant.
Second, the absolute value signs are omitted in the machine answer. That is ﬁne if our
problem is concerned only with values of greater than . But if we are interested in other
values of , then we need to insert the absolute value symbol.
In the next example we reconsider the integral of Example 4, but this time we ask a
machine for the answer.
EXAMPLE 5 Use a computer algebra system to ﬁnd 
.
SOLUTION Maple responds with the answer
This looks different from the answer we found in Example 4, but it is equivalent because
the third term can be rewritten using the identity
Thus
The resulting extra term 
can be absorbed into the constant of integration.
Mathematica gives the answer
Mathematica combined the ﬁrst two terms of Example 4 (and the Maple result) into a
single term by factoring.
Derive gives the answer
The ﬁrst term is like the ﬁrst term in the Mathematica answer, and the second term is
identical to the last term in Example 4.

N This is Equation 3.11.3.

It’s clear that both systems must have expanded 
by the Binomial Theorem and
then integrated each term.
If we integrate by hand instead, using the substitution 
, we get
For most purposes, this is a more convenient form of the answer.

We suspect that there are trigonometric identities which show these three answers are

APPROXIMATE INTEGRATION
There are two situations in which it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact value of a deﬁnite 
integral.
The ﬁrst situation arises from the fact that in order to evaluate 
using the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we need to know an antiderivative of . Sometimes,
however, it is difﬁcult, or even impossible, to ﬁnd an antiderivative (see Section 7.5). For
example, it is impossible to evaluate the following integrals exactly:
y

a fx dx
7.7

The second situation arises when the function is determined from a scientiﬁc experi-
ment through instrument readings or collected data. There may be no formula for the func-
tion (see Example 5).
In both cases we need to ﬁnd approximate values of deﬁnite integrals. We already know
one such method. Recall that the deﬁnite integral is deﬁned as a limit of Riemann sums,
so any Riemann sum could be used as an approximation to the integral: If we divide 
into subintervals of equal length 
, then we have
where 
is any point in the th subinterval 
. If 
is chosen to be the left endpoint
of the interval, then 
and we have
If 
, then the integral represents an area and (1) represents an approximation of this
area by the rectangles shown in Figure 1(a). If we choose 
to be the right endpoint, then
and we have
[See Figure 1(b).] The approximations 
and 
deﬁned by Equations 1 and 2 are called
the left endpoint approximation and right endpoint approximation, respectively.
In Section 5.2 we also considered the case where 
is chosen to be the midpoint 
of
the subinterval 
. Figure 1(c) shows the midpoint approximation 
, which appears
to be better than either 
or 
.
MIDPOINT RULE

Another approximation, called the Trapezoidal Rule, results from averaging the approx-
imations in Equations 1 and 2:

TRAPEZOIDAL RULE

and 
.
The reason for the name Trapezoidal Rule can be seen from Figure 2, which illustrates
the case 
. The area of the trapezoid that lies above the th subinterval is
and if we add the areas of all these trapezoids, we get the right side of the Trapezoidal
Rule.
EXAMPLE 1 Use (a) the Trapezoidal Rule and (b) the Midpoint Rule with 
to
approximate the integral 
.
SOLUTION
(a) With

zoidal Rule gives
This approximation is illustrated in Figure 3.

Rule gives

M
In Example 1 we deliberately chose an integral whose value can be computed explicitly
so that we can see how accurate the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are. By the Funda-
mental Theorem of Calculus,
The error in using an approximation is deﬁned to be the amount that needs to be added to
the approximation to make it exact. From the values in Example 1 we see that the errors

In general, we have
The following tables show the results of calculations similar to those in Example 1, but
for 
, and 
and for the left and right endpoint approximations as well as the
Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules.
We can make several observations from these tables:
1. In all of the methods we get more accurate approximations when we increase the
value of . (But very large values of result in so many arithmetic operations that
we have to beware of accumulated round-off error.)
2. The errors in the left and right endpoint approximations are opposite in sign and
appear to decrease by a factor of about 2 when we double the value of .
3. The Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are much more accurate than the endpoint
approximations.
4. The errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are opposite in sign and appear
to decrease by a factor of about 4 when we double the value of .
5. The size of the error in the Midpoint Rule is about half the size of the error in the
Trapezoidal Rule.
Figure 5 shows why we can usually expect the Midpoint Rule to be more accurate than
the Trapezoidal Rule. The area of a typical rectangle in the Midpoint Rule is the same as
the area of the trapezoid 
whose upper side is tangent to the graph at . The area of
this trapezoid is closer to the area under the graph than is the area of the trapezoid 
used in the Trapezoidal Rule. [The midpoint error (shaded red) is smaller than the trape-
zoidal error (shaded blue).]

Corresponding errors
N It turns out that these observations are true 
in most cases.
Module 5.2/7.7 allows you to 
compare approximation methods.
TEC

These observations are corroborated in the following error estimates, which are proved
in books on numerical analysis. Notice that Observation 4 corresponds to the 
in each
denominator because 
. The fact that the estimates depend on the size of the
second derivative is not surprising if you look at Figure 5, because 
measures how
much the graph is curved. [Recall that 
measures how fast the slope of 
changes.]
ERROR BOUNDS Suppose 
for 
. If 
and 
are the
errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules, then
Let’s apply this error estimate to the Trapezoidal Rule approximation in Example 1. If
, then 
and 
. Since 
, we have 
, so
Therefore, taking 
, and 
in the error estimate (3), we see that
Comparing this error estimate of 
with the actual error of about 
, we see
that it can happen that the actual error is substantially less than the upper bound for the
error given by (3).
EXAMPLE 2 How large should we take in order to guarantee that the Trapezoidal
and Midpoint Rule approximations for 
are accurate to within 
?

SIMPSON’S RULE
Another rule for approximate integration results from using parabolas instead of straight
line segments to approximate a curve. As before, we divide 
into 
subintervals of
equal length 
, but this time we assume that is an even number. Then
on each consecutive pair of intervals we approximate the curve 
by a parabola

To simplify our calculations, we ﬁrst consider the case where

and so the area under the parabola from

is
But, since the parabola passes through

and therefore
Thus we can rewrite the area under the parabola as
Now, by shifting this parabola horizontally we do not change the area under it. This means
that the area under the parabola through

is still
Similarly, the area under the parabola through

If we compute the areas under all the parabolas in this manner and add the results, we get

Notice that, in Example 4, Simpson’s Rule gives us a much better approximation
to the true value of the integral 
than does the
Trapezoidal Rule 
or the Midpoint Rule 
. It turns out
(see Exercise 48) that the approximations in Simpson’s Rule are weighted averages of
those in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules:
(Recall that 
and 
usually have opposite signs and 
is about half the size of

In many applications of calculus we need to evaluate an integral even if no explicit for-
mula is known for y as a function of x. A function may be given graphically or as a table
of values of collected data. If there is evidence that the values are not changing rapidly,
then the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’s Rule can still be used to ﬁnd an approximate value
for 
, the integral of y with respect to x.

put, measured in megabits per second

CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION
Thomas Simpson was a weaver who taught 
himself mathematics and went on to become one
of the best English mathematicians of the 18th
century. What we call Simpson’s Rule was 
actually known to Cavalieri and Gregory in the
17th century, but Simpson popularized it in his
best-selling calculus textbook, A New Treatise 
of Fluxions.
SIMPSON

SOLUTION Because we want the units to be consistent and 
is measured in megabits 
per second, we convert the units for from hours to seconds. If we let 
be the 
amount of data (in megabits) transmitted by time , where is measured in seconds, then
. So, by the Net Change Theorem (see Section 5.4), the total amount of data
transmitted by noon (when 
) is
We estimate the values of 
at hourly intervals from the graph and compile them in
the table.
Then we use Simpson’s Rule with 
and 
to estimate the integral:
Thus the total amount of data transmitted up to noon is about 144,000 megabits, or 
144 gigabits.
M
The table in the margin shows how Simpson’s Rule compares with the Midpoint Rule
for the integral 
, whose true value is about 0.69314718. The second table shows
how the error 
in Simpson’s Rule decreases by a factor of about 16 when 
is doubled.
(In Exercises 27 and 28 you are asked to verify this for two additional integrals.) That is
consistent with the appearance of 
in the denominator of the following error estimate for
Simpson’s Rule. It is similar to the estimates given in (3) for the Trapezoidal and Midpoint
Rules, but it uses the fourth derivative of .

CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION
N Many calculators and computer algebra sys-
tems have a built-in algorithm that computes an
approximation of a deﬁnite integral. Some of
these machines use Simpson’s Rule; others use
more sophisticated techniques such as adaptive
numerical integration. This means that if a func-
tion ﬂuctuates much more on a certain part of
the interval than it does elsewhere, then that
part gets divided into more subintervals. This
strategy reduces the number of calculations
required to achieve a prescribed accuracy.
N Figure 10 illustrates the calculation in
Example 7. Notice that the parabolic arcs are 
so close to the graph of 
that they are
practically indistinguishable from it.

IMPROPER INTEGRALS
In deﬁning a deﬁnite integral 
we dealt with a function deﬁned on a ﬁnite inter-
val 
and we assumed that 
does not have an inﬁnite discontinuity (see Section 5.2).
In this section we extend the concept of a deﬁnite integral to the case where the interval is
inﬁnite and also to the case where 
has an inﬁnite discontinuity in 
. In either case
the integral is called an improper integral. One of the most important applications of this
idea, probability distributions, will be studied in Section 8.5.
TYPE 1: INFINITE INTERVALS
Consider the inﬁnite region 
that lies under the curve 
, above the -axis, and to
the right of the line 
. You might think that, since 
is inﬁnite in extent, its area must
be inﬁnite, but let’s take a closer look. The area of the part of 
that lies to the left of the
line 
(shaded in Figure 1) is
Notice that 
no matter how large is chosen.
We also observe that
The area of the shaded region approaches as 
(see Figure 2), so we say that the area
of the inﬁnite region 
is equal to and we write
Using this example as a guide, we deﬁne the integral of 
(not necessarily a positive
function) over an inﬁnite interval as the limit of integrals over ﬁnite intervals.

CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION

DEFINITION OF AN IMPROPER INTEGRAL OF TYPE 1
(a) If 
exists for every number 
, then
provided this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
(b) If 
exists for every number 
, then
provided this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
The improper integrals 
and 
are called convergent if the
corresponding limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist.
(c) If both 
and 
are convergent, then we deﬁne
In part (c) any real number can be used (see Exercise 74).
Any of the improper integrals in Deﬁnition 1 can be interpreted as an area provided that
is a positive function. For instance, in case (a) if 
and the integral 
is convergent, then we deﬁne the area of the region 
in
Figure 3 to be
This is appropriate because 
is the limit as 
of the area under the graph of

EXAMPLE 1 Determine whether the integral 
is convergent or divergent.
SOLUTION According to part (a) of Deﬁnition 1, we have
The limit does not exist as a ﬁnite number and so the improper integral 
is
divergent.

section:
Geometrically, this says that although the curves 
and 
look very similar
for 
, the region under 
to the right of 
(the shaded region in Figure 4)
has ﬁnite area whereas the corresponding region under 
(in Figure 5) has inﬁnite
area. Note that both 
and 
approach 
as 
but 
approaches 
faster than

visually and numerically whether several
improper integrals are convergent or 
divergent.

Since both of these integrals are convergent, the given integral is convergent and
Since

point of

is a vertical asymptote of the integrand. Since it
occurs in the middle of the interval 
, we must use part (c) of Deﬁnition 3 with
:
where
because 
as 
. Thus 
is divergent. This implies that
is divergent. [We do not need to evaluate 
.]

WARNING If we had not noticed the asymptote 
in Example 7 and had instead 
confused the integral with an ordinary integral, then we might have made the following
erroneous calculation:
This is wrong because the integral is improper and must be calculated in terms of limits.
From now on, whenever you meet the symbol 
you must decide, by looking
at the function 
on 
, whether it is an ordinary deﬁnite integral or an improper 
integral.

SOLUTION We know that the function 
has a vertical asymptote at 0 since

To ﬁnd the limit of the ﬁrst term we use l’Hospital’s Rule:
Therefore

A COMPARISON TEST FOR IMPROPER INTEGRALS
Sometimes it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact value of an improper integral and yet it 
is important to know whether it is convergent or divergent. In such cases the following the-
orem is useful. Although we state it for Type 1 integrals, a similar theorem is true for
Type 2 integrals.
COMPARISON THEOREM Suppose that 
and are continuous functions with
for 
.
(a) If 
is convergent, then 
is convergent.
(b) If 
is divergent, then 
is divergent.
We omit the proof of the Comparison Theorem, but Figure 12 makes it seem plausible.
If the area under the top curve 
is ﬁnite, then so is the area under the bottom curve
. And if the area under 
is inﬁnite, then so is the area under 
.
[Note that the reverse is not necessarily true: If 
is convergent,
may 
or may not be convergent, and if 
is divergent,
may or may not be
divergent.]
EXAMPLE 9 Show that 
is convergent.
SOLUTION We can’t evaluate the integral directly because the antiderivative of 
is not an
elementary function (as explained in Section 7.5). We write
and observe that the ﬁrst integral on the right-hand side is just an ordinary deﬁnite inte-
gral. In the second integral we use the fact that for 
we have 
, so 
and therefore 
. (See Figure 13.) The integral of 
is easy to evaluate:

Thus, taking 
and 
in the Comparison Theorem, we see that
is convergent. It follows that 
is convergent.
M
In Example 9 we showed that 
is convergent without computing its value. In
Exercise 70 we indicate how to show that its value is approximately 0.8862. In probabil-
ity theory it is important to know the exact value of this improper integral, as we will see
in Section 8.5; using the methods of multivariable calculus it can be shown that the exact
value is 
. Table 1 illustrates the deﬁnition of an improper integral by showing how
the (computer-generated) values of 
approach 
as t becomes large. In fact,
these values converge quite quickly because 
very rapidly as 
.
EXAMPLE 10 The integral 
is divergent by the Comparison Theorem
because
and 
is divergent by Example 1 [or by (2) with 
].
M
Table 2 illustrates the divergence of the integral in Example 10. It appears that the 
values are not approaching any ﬁxed number.

EXAMPLE 1
(a) Prove that if 
is a continuous function, then
(b) Use part (a) to show that
for all positive numbers .
SOLUTION
(a) At ﬁrst sight, the given equation may appear somewhat bafﬂing. How is it possible
to connect the left side to the right side? Connections can often be made through one of
the principles of problem solving: introduce something extra. Here the extra ingredient is
a new variable. We often think of introducing a new variable when we use the Substitu-
tion Rule to integrate a speciﬁc function. But that technique is still useful in the present
circumstance in which we have a general function .
Once we think of making a substitution, the form of the right side suggests that it
should be 
. Then 
. When 
,
; when 
,
. So 
But this integral on the right side is just another way of writing 
. So the given
equation is proved.
(b) If we let the given integral be and apply part (a) with 
, we get
A well-known trigonometric identity tells us that 
and
, so we get
Notice that the two expressions for are very similar. In fact, the integrands have the
same denominator. This suggests that we should add the two expressions. If we do so,
we get
Therefore,

integration—the length of a curve, the area of a surface—as well as quantities of
interest in physics, engineering, biology, economics, and statistics. For instance, we will
investigate the center of gravity of a plate, the force exerted by water pressure on a dam,
the ﬂow of blood from the human heart, and the average time spent on hold during a
customer support telephone call.
The length of a curve 
is the limit of lengths of 
inscribed polygons.

ARC LENGTH
What do we mean by the length of a curve? We might think of ﬁtting a piece of string to
the curve in Figure 1 and then measuring the string against a ruler. But that might be 
difﬁcult to do with much accuracy if we have a complicated curve. We need a precise 
deﬁnition for the length of an arc of a curve, in the same spirit as the deﬁnitions we devel-
oped for the concepts of area and volume.
If the curve is a polygon, we can easily ﬁnd its length; we just add the lengths of the
line segments that form the polygon. (We can use the distance formula to ﬁnd the distance
between the endpoints of each segment.) We are going to deﬁne the length of a general
curve by ﬁrst approximating it by a polygon and then taking a limit as the number of seg-
ments of the polygon is increased. This process is familiar for the case of a circle, where
the circumference is the limit of lengths of inscribed polygons (see Figure 2).
Now suppose that a curve 
is deﬁned by the equation 
, where f is continuous
and 
. We obtain a polygonal approximation to 
by dividing the interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints 
and equal width 
. If 
, then 
the point 
lies on 
and the polygon with vertices 
,
, . . . ,
, illustrated in
Figure 3, is an approximation to .
The length L of 
is approximately the length of this polygon and the approximation
gets better as we let n increase. (See Figure 4, where the arc of the curve between 
and
has been magniﬁed and approximations with successively smaller values of 
are
shown.) Therefore we deﬁne the length
of the curve 
with equation 
,
, as the limit of the lengths of these inscribed polygons (if the limit exists):
Notice that the procedure for deﬁning arc length is very similar to the procedure we
used for deﬁning area and volume: We divided the curve into a large number of small parts.
We then found the approximate lengths of the small parts and added them. Finally, we took
the limit as 
.
The deﬁnition of arc length given by Equation 1 is not very convenient for compu-
tational purposes, but we can derive an integral formula for 
in the case where 
has a 
continuous derivative. [Such a function 
is called smooth because a small change in 
produces a small change in 
.]

Because of the presence of the square root sign in Formulas 2 and 4, the calculation of
an arc length often leads to an integral that is very difﬁcult or even impossible to evaluate
explicitly. Thus we sometimes have to be content with ﬁnding an approximation to the
length of a curve, as in the following example.
EXAMPLE 3
(a) Set up an integral for the length of the arc of the hyperbola 
from the

THE ARC LENGTH FUNCTION
We will ﬁnd it useful to have a function that measures the arc length of a curve from a par-
ticular starting point to any other point on the curve. Thus if a smooth curve 
has the
equation 
,
, let 
be the distance along 
from the initial point
to the point 
. Then is a function, called the arc length function, and,
by Formula 2,
(We have replaced the variable of integration by so that does not have two meanings.)
We can use Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to differentiate Equation 5
(since the integrand is continuous):

CHAPTER 8 FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
N Checking the value of the deﬁnite integral
with a more accurate approximation produced by
a computer algebra system, we see that the
approximation using Simpson’s Rule is accurate
to four decimal places.

Equation 6 shows that the rate of change of with respect to 
is always at least 1 and is
equal to 1 when 
, the slope of the curve, is 0. The differential of arc length is
and this equation is sometimes written in the symmetric form
The geometric interpretation of Equation 8 is shown in Figure 7. It can be used as a
mnemonic device for remembering both of the Formulas 3 and 4. If we write 
, then
from Equation 8 either we can solve to get (7), which gives (3), or we can solve to get
which gives (4).

CHAPTER 8 FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
AREA OF A SURFACE OF REVOLUTION
A surface of revolution is formed when a curve is rotated about a line. Such a surface is
the lateral boundary of a solid of revolution of the type discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3.
We want to deﬁne the area of a surface of revolution in such a way that it corresponds
to our intuition. If the surface area is , we can imagine that painting the surface would
require the same amount of paint as does a ﬂat region with area .
Let’s start with some simple surfaces. The lateral surface area of a circular cylinder with
radius and height 
is taken to be 
because we can imagine cutting the cylin-
der and unrolling it (as in Figure 1) to obtain a rectangle with dimensions 
and .
Likewise, we can take a circular cone with base radius and slant height , cut it along
the dashed line in Figure 2, and ﬂatten it to form a sector of a circle with radius and cen-
tral angle 
. We know that, in general, the area of a sector of a circle with radius
and angle 
is 
(see Exercise 35 in Section 7.3) and so in this case the area is
Therefore we deﬁne the lateral surface area of a cone to be 
.

What about more complicated surfaces of revolution? If we follow the strategy we used
with arc length, we can approximate the original curve by a polygon. When this polygon
is rotated about an axis, it creates a simpler surface whose surface area approximates the
actual surface area. By taking a limit, we can determine the exact surface area.
The approximating surface, then, consists of a number of bands, each formed by rotat-
ing a line segment about an axis. To ﬁnd the surface area, each of these bands can be 
considered a portion of a circular cone, as shown in Figure 3. The area of the band (or frus-
tum of a cone) with slant height 
and upper and lower radii 
and 
is found by sub-
tracting the areas of two cones:
From similar triangles we have
which gives
or
Putting this in Equation 1, we get
or
where 
is the average radius of the band.
Now we apply this formula to our strategy. Consider the surface shown in Figure 4,
which is obtained by rotating the curve 
,
, about the -axis, where 
is
positive and has a continuous derivative. In order to deﬁne its surface area, we divide the
interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints 
and equal width 
, as we
did in determining arc length. If 
, then the point 
lies on the curve. The
part of the surface between 
and 
is approximated by taking the line segment 
and rotating it about the -axis. The result is a band with slant height 
and aver-
age radius 
so, by Formula 2, its surface area is

what if we rotate about a slanted line, that is, a line that is neither horizontal nor vertical? In this

APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING
Among the many applications of integral calculus to physics and engineering, we consider
two here: force due to water pressure and centers of mass. As with our previous applica-
tions to geometry (areas, volumes, and lengths) and to work, our strategy is to break up the
physical quantity into a large number of small parts, approximate each small part, add the
results, take the limit, and then evaluate the resulting integral.
HYDROSTATIC FORCE AND PRESSURE
Deep-sea divers realize that water pressure increases as they dive deeper. This is because
the weight of the water above them increases.
In general, suppose that a thin horizontal plate with area 
square meters is submerged
in a ﬂuid of density 
kilograms per cubic meter at a depth 
meters below the surface of
the ﬂuid as in Figure 1. The ﬂuid directly above the plate has volume 
, so its mass
is 
. The force exerted by the ﬂuid on the plate is therefore

FIGURE 1

where is the acceleration due to gravity. The pressure
on the plate is deﬁned to be the
force per unit area:
The SI unit for measuring pressure is newtons per square meter, which is called a pascal
(abbreviation: 1 Nm
Pa). Since this is a small unit, the kilopascal (kPa) is often
used. For instance, because the density of water is 
, the pressure at the
bottom of a swimming pool 2 m deep is
An important principle of ﬂuid pressure is the experimentally veriﬁed fact that at any
point in a liquid the pressure is the same in all directions. (A diver feels the same pressure
on nose and both ears.) Thus the pressure in any direction at a depth in a ﬂuid with mass
density is given by
This helps us determine the hydrostatic force against a vertical plate or wall or dam in a
ﬂuid. This is not a straightforward problem because the pressure is not constant but
increases as the depth increases.
EXAMPLE 1 A dam has the shape of the trapezoid shown in Figure 2. The height is
20 m, and the width is 50 m at the top and 30 m at the bottom. Find the force on the dam
due to hydrostatic pressure if the water level is 4 m from the top of the dam.
SOLUTION We choose a vertical -axis with origin at the surface of the water as in 
Figure 3(a). The depth of the water is 16 m, so we divide the interval 
into sub-
intervals of equal length with endpoints 
and we choose 
. The 
hori-
zontal strip of the dam is approximated by a rectangle with height 
and width

on the 
strip is almost constant and we can use
Equation 1 to write
The hydrostatic force 
acting on the 
strip is the product of the pressure and the

EXAMPLE 2 Find the hydrostatic force on one end of a cylindrical drum with radius 3 ft
if the drum is submerged in water 10 ft deep.
SOLUTION In this example it is convenient to choose the axes as in Figure 4 so that the 
origin is placed at the center of the drum. Then the circle has a simple equation,
. As in Example 1 we divide the circular region into horizontal strips of
equal width. From the equation of the circle, we see that the length of the 
strip is
and so its area is
The pressure on this strip is approximately
and so the force on the strip is approximately
The total force is obtained by adding the forces on all the strips and taking the limit:
The second integral is 0 because the integrand is an odd function (see Theorem 5.5.7).
The ﬁrst integral can be evaluated using the trigonometric substitution 
, but
it’s simpler to observe that it is the area of a semicircular disk with radius 3. Thus

MOMENTS AND CENTERS OF MASS
Our main objective here is to ﬁnd the point 
on which a thin plate of any given shape bal-
ances horizontally as in Figure 5. This point is called the center of mass (or center of grav-
ity) of the plate.
We ﬁrst consider the simpler situation illustrated in Figure 6, where two masses 
and
are attached to a rod of negligible mass on opposite sides of a fulcrum and at distances
and 
from the fulcrum. The rod will balance if
This is an experimental fact discovered by Archimedes and called the Law of the Lever.
(Think of a lighter person balancing a heavier one on a seesaw by sitting farther away from
the center.)
Now suppose that the rod lies along the -axis with 
at 
and 
at 
and the center
of mass at . If we compare Figures 6 and 7, we see that 
and 
and
so Equation 2 gives
The numbers 
and 
are called the moments of the masses 
and 
(with respect
to the origin), and Equation 3 says that the center of mass 
is obtained by adding the
moments of the masses and dividing by the total mass 
.
In general, if we have a system of particles with masses 
,
. . . ,
located at the
points 
,
. . . ,
on the -axis, it can be shown similarly that the center of mass of the
system is located at
where 
is the total mass of the system, and the sum of the individual moments
is called the moment of the system about the origin. Then Equation 4 could be rewritten
as 
, which says that if the total mass were considered as being concentrated at the
center of mass , then its moment would be the same as the moment of the system.

Now we consider a system of 
particles with masses 
,
. . . ,
located at the
points 
,
, . . . ,
in the 
-plane as shown in Figure 8. By analogy with
the one-dimensional case, we deﬁne the moment of the system about the y-axis to be
and the moment of the system about the x-axis as
Then 
measures the tendency of the system to rotate about the -axis and 
measures
the tendency to rotate about the -axis.
As in the one-dimensional case, the coordinates 
of the center of mass are given
in terms of the moments by the formulas
where 
is the total mass. Since 
and 
, the center of mass 
is the point where a single particle of mass 
would have the same moments as the
system.
EXAMPLE 3 Find the moments and center of mass of the system of objects that have
masses 3, 4, and 8 at the points 
,
, and 
, respectively.
SOLUTION We use Equations 5 and 6 to compute the moments:
Since 
, we use Equations 7 to obtain
Thus the center of mass is 
. (See Figure 9.)
M
Next we consider a ﬂat plate (called a lamina) with uniform density 
that occupies a
region 
of the plane. We wish to locate the center of mass of the plate, which is called
the centroid of 
. In doing so we use the following physical principles: The symmetry
principle says that if 
is symmetric about a line , then the centroid of 
lies on . (If 
is reﬂected about , then 
remains the same so its centroid remains ﬁxed. But the only
ﬁxed points lie on .) Thus the centroid of a rectangle is its center. Moments should be
deﬁned so that if the entire mass of a region is concentrated at the center of mass, then its
moments remain unchanged. Also, the moment of the union of two nonoverlapping regions
should be the sum of the moments of the individual regions.

center of mass

Suppose that the region 
is of the type shown in Figure 10(a); that is,
lies between
the lines 
and 
, above the -axis, and beneath the graph of , where 
is a 
continuous function. We divide the interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints
and equal width 
. We choose the sample point 
to be the midpoint 
of
the th subinterval, that is,
. This determines the polygonal approxima-
tion to 
shown in Figure 10(b). The centroid of the th approximating rectangle 
is its
center 
. Its area is 
, so its mass is
The moment of 
about the -axis is the product of its mass and the distance from 
to
the -axis, which is 
Adding these moments, we obtain the moment of the polygonal approximation to 
, and
then by taking the limit as 
we obtain the moment of 
itself about the -axis:
In a similar fashion we compute the moment of 
about the -axis as the product of its
mass and the distance from 
to the -axis:
Again we add these moments and take the limit to obtain the moment of 
about the 
-axis:
Just as for systems of particles, the center of mass of the plate is deﬁned so that
and 
. But the mass of the plate is the product of its density and its area:
and so
Notice the cancellation of the ’s. The location of the center of mass is independent of the
density.

CHAPTER 8 FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
APPLICATIONS TO ECONOMICS AND BIOLOGY
In this section we consider some applications of integration to economics (consumer sur-
plus) and biology (blood ﬂow, cardiac output). Others are described in the exercises.
CONSUMER SURPLUS
Recall from Section 4.7 that the demand function 
is the price that a company has to
charge in order to sell 
units of a commodity. Usually, selling larger quantities requires
lowering prices, so the demand function is a decreasing function. The graph of a typical
demand function, called a demand curve, is shown in Figure 1. If 
is the amount of the
commodity that is currently available, then 
is the current selling price.
We divide the interval 
into 
subintervals, each of length 
, and let
be the right endpoint of the th subinterval, as in Figure 2. If, after the ﬁrst 
units were sold, a total of only 
units had been available and the price per unit had been
set at 
dollars, then the additional 
units could have been sold (but no more). The
consumers who would have paid 
dollars placed a high value on the product; they
would have paid what it was worth to them. So, in paying only 
dollars they have saved

A typical demand curve
Suppose you have a choice of two coffee cups of the type shown, one that bends outward and one
inward, and you notice that they have the same height and their shapes ﬁt together snugly. You
wonder which cup holds more coffee. Of course you could ﬁll one cup with water and pour it 
into the other one but, being a calculus student, you decide on a more mathematical approach.
Ignoring the handles, you observe that both cups are surfaces of revolution, so you can think of
the coffee as a volume of revolution.
1. Suppose the cups have height , cup A is formed by rotating the curve 
about the 
-axis, and cup B is formed by rotating the same curve about the line 
. Find the value 
of such that the two cups hold the same amount of coffee.
2. What does your result from Problem 1 say about the areas 
and 
shown in the ﬁgure?
3. Use Pappus’s Theorem to explain your result in Problems 1 and 2.
4. Based on your own measurements and observations, suggest a value for 
and an equation
for 
and calculate the amount of coffee that each cup holds.

Considering similar groups of willing consumers for each of the subintervals and adding
the savings, we get the total savings:
(This sum corresponds to the area enclosed by the rectangles in Figure 2.) If we let
,
this Riemann sum approaches the integral
which economists call the consumer surplus for the commodity.
The consumer surplus represents the amount of money saved by consumers in pur-
chasing the commodity at price , corresponding to an amount demanded of . Figure 3
shows the interpretation of the consumer surplus as the area under the demand curve and
above the line 
.
EXAMPLE 1 The demand for a product, in dollars, is
Find the consumer surplus when the sales level is 500.
SOLUTION Since the number of products sold is 
, the corresponding price is
Therefore, from Deﬁnition 1, the consumer surplus is

BLOOD FLOW
In Example 7 in Section 3.7 we discussed the law of laminar ﬂow:
which gives the velocity of blood that ﬂows along a blood vessel with radius 
and length
at a distance from the central axis, where 
is the pressure difference between the ends
of the vessel and 
is the viscosity of the blood. Now, in order to compute the rate of blood
ﬂow, or ﬂux (volume per unit time), we consider smaller, equally spaced radii

The approximate area of the ring (or washer) with inner radius 
and outer radius 
is
where
(See Figure 4.) If 
is small, then the velocity is almost constant throughout this ring and
can be approximated by 
. Thus the volume of blood per unit time that ﬂows across the
ring is approximately
and the total volume of blood that ﬂows across a cross-section per unit time is approxi-
mately
This approximation is illustrated in Figure 5. Notice that the velocity (and hence the vol-
ume per unit time) increases toward the center of the blood vessel. The approximation gets
better as n increases. When we take the limit we get the exact value of the ﬂux (or dis-
charge), which is the volume of blood that passes a cross-section per unit time:
The resulting equation
is called Poiseuille’s Law; it shows that the ﬂux is proportional to the fourth power of the
radius of the blood vessel.
CARDIAC OUTPUT
Figure 6 shows the human cardiovascular system. Blood returns from the body through the
veins, enters the right atrium of the heart, and is pumped to the lungs through the pul-
monary arteries for oxygenation. It then ﬂows back into the left atrium through the pulmo-
nary veins and then out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The cardiac output
of the heart is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit time, that is, the rate of
ﬂow into the aorta.
The dye dilution method is used to measure the cardiac output. Dye is injected into the
right atrium and ﬂows through the heart into the aorta. A probe inserted into the aorta
measures the concentration of the dye leaving the heart at equally spaced times over a time
interval 
until the dye has cleared. Let 
be the concentration of the dye at time 
If we divide 
into subintervals of equal length 
, then the amount of dye that ﬂows
past the measuring point during the subinterval from 
to 
is approximately

sion in a lake resort area. The number of mosquitos is
increasing at an estimated rate of 
per week
(where is measured in weeks). By how much does the mos-
quito population increase between the ﬁfth and ninth weeks
of summer?
15. Use Poiseuille’s Law to calculate the rate of ﬂow in a small
human artery where we can take 
,
cm,
cm, and 
dynescm .
16. High blood pressure results from constriction of the arteries. 
To maintain a normal ﬂow rate (ﬂux), the heart has to pump
harder, thus increasing the blood pressure. Use Poiseuille’s
Law to show that if 
and 
are normal values of the radius
and pressure in an artery and the constricted values are 
and
, then for the ﬂux to remain constant,

Deduce that if the radius of an artery is reduced to three-
fourths of its former value, then the pressure is more than
tripled.

SECTION 8.5 PROBABILITY

PROBABILITY
Calculus plays a role in the analysis of random behavior. Suppose we consider the choles-
terol level of a person chosen at random from a certain age group, or the height of an adult
female chosen at random, or the lifetime of a randomly chosen battery of a certain type.
Such quantities are called continuous random variables because their values actually
range over an interval of real numbers, although they might be measured or recorded only
to the nearest integer. We might want to know the probability that a blood cholesterol level
is greater than 250, or the probability that the height of an adult female is between 60 and
70 inches, or the probability that the battery we are buying lasts between 100 and 200
hours. If X represents the lifetime of that type of battery, we denote this last probability as
follows:
According to the frequency interpretation of probability, this number is the long-run pro-
portion of all batteries of the speciﬁed type whose lifetimes are between 100 and 200
hours. Since it represents a proportion, the probability naturally falls between 0 and 1.
Every continuous random variable X has a probability density function . This means
that the probability that X lies between a and b is found by integrating 
from a to b:
For example, Figure 1 shows the graph of a model for the probability density function
for a random variable X deﬁned to be the height in inches of an adult female in the
United States (according to data from the National Health Survey). The probability that the
height of a woman chosen at random from this population is between 60 and 70 inches is
equal to the area under the graph of 
from 60 to 70.
In general, the probability density function 
of a random variable X satisﬁes the con-
dition 
for all x. Because probabilities are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, it fol-
lows that

SOLUTION
(a) For 
we have

check that Equation 2 is satisﬁed:
Therefore

EXAMPLE 2 Phenomena such as waiting times and equipment failure times are com-
monly modeled by exponentially decreasing probability density functions. Find the exact
form of such a function.
SOLUTION Think of the random variable as being the time you wait on hold before an 
agent of a company you’re telephoning answers your call. So instead of x, let’s use t to
represent time, in minutes. If 
is the probability density function and you call at time
, then, from Deﬁnition 1,
represents the probability that an agent answers
within the ﬁrst two minutes and 
is the probability that your call is answered
during the ﬁfth minute.
It’s clear that 
for 
(the agent can’t answer before you place the call).
For 
we are told to use an exponentially decreasing function, that is, a function of
the form 
, where A and c are positive constants. Thus
We use Equation 2 to determine the value of A:
Therefore 
and so 
. Thus every exponential density function has the form
A typical graph is shown in Figure 2.

AVERAGE VALUES
Suppose you’re waiting for a company to answer your phone call and you wonder how
long, on average, you can expect to wait. Let 
be the corresponding density function,
where t is measured in minutes, and think of a sample of N people who have called this
company. Most likely, none of them had to wait more than an hour, so let’s restrict our
attention to the interval 
. Let’s divide that interval into n intervals of length 
and endpoints 
. . .
. (Think of 
as lasting a minute, or half a minute, or 10 sec-
onds, or even a second.) The probability that somebody’s call gets answered during the
time period from 
to 
is the area under the curve 
from 
to , which is
approximately equal to 
. (This is the area of the approximating rectangle in Fig-
ure 3, where is the midpoint of the interval.)
Since the long-run proportion of calls that get answered in the time period from 
to
is 
, we expect that, out of our sample of N callers, the number whose call was
answered in that time period is approximately 
and the time that each waited is
about . Therefore the total time they waited is the product of these numbers: approxi-
mately 
. Adding over all such intervals, we get the approximate total of every-
body’s waiting times:
If we now divide by the number of callers N, we get the approximate average waiting time:
We recognize this as a Riemann sum for the function 
. As the time interval shrinks
(that is,
and 
), this Riemann sum approaches the integral
This integral is called the mean waiting time.
In general, the mean of any probability density function 
is deﬁned to be
The mean can be interpreted as the long-run average value of the random variable X. It can
also be interpreted as a measure of centrality of the probability density function.
The expression for the mean resembles an integral we have seen before. If 
is the
region that lies under the graph of
, we know from Formula 8.3.8 that the x-coordinate of
the centroid of 
is
because of Equation 2. So a thin plate in the shape of 
balances at a point on the vertical
line

EXAMPLE 3 Find the mean of the exponential distribution of Example 2:
SOLUTION According to the deﬁnition of a mean, we have
To evaluate this integral we use integration by parts, with 
and 
:
The mean is 
, so we can rewrite the probability density function as

EXAMPLE 4 Suppose the average waiting time for a customer’s call to be answered 
by a company representative is ﬁve minutes.
(a) Find the probability that a call is answered during the ﬁrst minute.
(b) Find the probability that a customer waits more than ﬁve minutes to be answered.
SOLUTION
(a) We are given that the mean of the exponential distribution is 
min and so,
from the result of Example 3, we know that the probability density function is 
Thus the probability that a call is answered during the ﬁrst minute is
So about 18% of customers’ calls are answered during the ﬁrst minute.
(b) The probability that a customer waits more than ﬁve minutes is
About 37% of customers wait more than ﬁve minutes before their calls are answered.

Notice the result of Example 4(b): Even though the mean waiting time is 5 minutes,
only 37% of callers wait more than 5 minutes. The reason is that some callers have to wait
much longer (maybe 10 or 15 minutes), and this brings up the average.
Another measure of centrality of a probability density function is the median. That is a
number m such that half the callers have a waiting time less than m and the other callers
have a waiting time longer than m. In general, the median of a probability density func-
tion is the number m such that
This means that half the area under the graph of 
lies to the right of m. In Exercise 9 you
are asked to show that the median waiting time for the company described in Example 4
is approximately 3.5 minutes.
NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Many important random phenomena—such as test scores on aptitude tests, heights and
weights of individuals from a homogeneous population, annual rainfall in a given loca-
tion—are modeled by a normal distribution. This means that the probability density
function of the random variable X is a member of the family of functions
You can verify that the mean for this function is . The positive constant 
is called the
standard deviation; it measures how spread out the values of X are. From the bell-shaped
graphs of members of the family in Figure 5, we see that for small values of 
the values
of X are clustered about the mean, whereas for larger values of 
the values of X are more
spread out. Statisticians have methods for using sets of data to estimate 
and .
The factor 
is needed to make 
a probability density function. In fact, it can
be veriﬁed using the methods of multivariable calculus that

function.)

SOLUTION
(a) Since IQ scores are normally distributed, we use the probability density function
given by Equation 3 with 
and 
:
Recall from Section 7.5 that the function 
doesn’t have an elementary anti-
derivative, so we can’t evaluate the integral exactly. But we can use the numerical 
integration capability of a calculator or computer (or the Midpoint Rule or Simpson’s
Rule) to estimate the integral. Doing so, we ﬁnd that
So about 68% of the population has an IQ between 85 and 115, that is, within one stan-
dard deviation of the mean.
(b) The probability that the IQ score of a person chosen at random is more than 140 is
To avoid the improper integral we could approximate it by the integral from 140 to 200.
(It’s quite safe to say that people with an IQ over 200 are extremely rare.) Then
Therefore about 0.4% of the population has an IQ over 140.

Perhaps the most important of all the applications of calculus is to differential equa-
tions. When physical scientists or social scientists use calculus, more often than not 
it is to analyze a differential equation that has arisen in the process of modeling some
phenomenon that they are studying. Although it is often impossible to ﬁnd an explicit
formula for the solution of a differential equation, we will see that graphical and numer-
ical approaches provide the needed information.
Direction ﬁelds enable us 
to sketch solutions of 
differential equations with-
out an explicit formula.

MODELING WITH DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In describing the process of modeling in Section 1.2, we talked about formulating a math-
ematical model of a real-world problem either through intuitive reasoning about the phe-
nomenon or from a physical law based on evidence from experiments. The mathematical
model often takes the form of a differential equation, that is, an equation that contains an
unknown function and some of its derivatives. This is not surprising because in a real-
world problem we often notice that changes occur and we want to predict future behavior
on the basis of how current values change. Let’s begin by examining several examples of
how differential equations arise when we model physical phenomena.
MODELS OF POPULATION GROWTH
One model for the growth of a population is based on the assumption that the population
grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population. That is a reasonable assumption
for a population of bacteria or animals under ideal conditions (unlimited environment, ade-
quate nutrition, absence of predators, immunity from disease).
Let’s identify and name the variables in this model:
The rate of growth of the population is the derivative 
. So our assumption that the
rate of growth of the population is proportional to the population size is written as the
equation
where 
is the proportionality constant. Equation 1 is our ﬁrst model for population
growth; it is a differential equation because it contains an unknown function P and its
derivative 
.
Having formulated a model, let’s look at its consequences. If we rule out a population
of 0, then 
for all t. So, if 
, then Equation 1 shows that 
for all t.
This means that the population is always increasing. In fact, as 
increases, Equation 1
shows that 
becomes larger. In other words, the growth rate increases as the popula-
tion increases.
Equation 1 asks us to ﬁnd a function whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself.
We know from Chapter 3 that exponential functions have that property. In fact, if we let
, then
Thus any exponential function of the form 
is a solution of Equation 1. In Sec-
tion 9.4 we will see that there is no other solution.
Allowing C to vary through all the real numbers, we get the family of solutions
whose graphs are shown in Figure 1. But populations have only positive 
values and so we are interested only in the solutions with 
. And we are probably con-

cerned only with values of t greater than the initial time 
. Figure 2 shows the physi-
cally meaningful solutions. Putting 
, we get 
, so the constant C
turns out to be the initial population,
.
Equation 1 is appropriate for modeling population growth under ideal conditions, but
we have to recognize that a more realistic model must reﬂect the fact that a given environ-
ment has limited resources. Many populations start by increasing in an exponential man-
ner, but the population levels off when it approaches its carrying capacity K (or decreases
toward K if it ever exceeds K). For a model to take into account both trends, we make two
assumptions:
N
if P is small (Initially, the growth rate is proportional to P.)
N
if 
(P decreases if it ever exceeds K.)
A simple expression that incorporates both assumptions is given by the equation 
Notice that if P is small compared with K, then 
is close to 0 and so 
. If
, then 
is negative and so 
.
Equation 2 is called the logistic differential equation and was proposed by the Dutch
mathematical biologist Pierre-François Verhulst in the 1840s as a model for world popula-
tion growth. We will develop techniques that enable us to ﬁnd explicit solutions of the
logistic equation in Section 9.4, but for now we can deduce qualitative characteristics of
the solutions directly from Equation 2. We ﬁrst observe that the constant functions
and 
are solutions because, in either case, one of the factors on the right
side of Equation 2 is zero. (This certainly makes physical sense: If the population is ever
either 0 or at the carrying capacity, it stays that way.) These two constant solutions are
called equilibrium solutions.
If the initial population 
lies between 0 and K, then the right side of Equation 2 is
positive, so 
and the population increases. But if the population exceeds the car-
rying capacity 
, then 
is negative, so 
and the population
decreases. Notice that, in either case, if the population approaches the carrying capacity
, then 
, which means the population levels off. So we expect that the
solutions of the logistic differential equation have graphs that look something like the ones
in Figure 3. Notice that the graphs move away from the equilibrium solution 
and
move toward the equilibrium solution 
.
A MODEL FOR THE MOTION OF A SPRING
Let’s now look at an example of a model from the physical sciences. We consider the
motion of an object with mass m at the end of a vertical spring (as in Figure 4). In Sec-
tion 6.4 we discussed Hooke’s Law, which says that if the spring is stretched (or com-
pressed) x units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to x:
where k is a positive constant (called the spring constant). If we ignore any external resist-
ing forces (due to air resistance or friction) then, by Newton’s Second Law (force equals

mass times acceleration), we have
This is an example of what is called a second-order differential equation because it
involves second derivatives. Let’s see what we can guess about the form of the solution
directly from the equation. We can rewrite Equation 3 in the form
which says that the second derivative of x is proportional to x but has the opposite sign. We
know two functions with this property, the sine and cosine functions. In fact, it turns 
out that all solutions of Equation 3 can be written as combinations of certain sine 
and cosine functions (see Exercise 4). This is not surprising; we expect the spring to oscil-
late about its equilibrium position and so it is natural to think that trigonometric functions
are involved.
GENERAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In general, a differential equation is an equation that contains an unknown function and
one or more of its derivatives. The order of a differential equation is the order of the high-
est derivative that occurs in the equation. Thus, Equations 1 and 2 are ﬁrst-order equations
and Equation 3 is a second-order equation. In all three of those equations the independent
variable is called t and represents time, but in general the independent variable doesn’t
have to represent time. For example, when we consider the differential equation
it is understood that y is an unknown function of x.
A function
is called a solution of a differential equation if the equation is satisﬁed
when 
and its derivatives are substituted into the equation. Thus 
is a solution of
Equation 4 if
for all values of x in some interval.
When we are asked to solve a differential equation we are expected to ﬁnd all possible
solutions of the equation. We have already solved some particularly simple differential
equations, namely, those of the form
For instance, we know that the general solution of the differential equation
is given by
where C is an arbitrary constant.
But, in general, solving a differential equation is not an easy matter. There is no sys-
tematic technique that enables us to solve all differential equations. In Section 9.2, how-
ever, we will see how to draw rough graphs of solutions even when we have no explicit
formula. We will also learn how to ﬁnd numerical approximations to solutions.

The right side of the differential equation becomes
Therefore, for every value of c, the given function is a solution of the differential 
equation.
M
When applying differential equations, we are usually not as interested in ﬁnding a fam-
ily of solutions (the general solution) as we are in ﬁnding a solution that satisﬁes some
additional requirement. In many physical problems we need to ﬁnd the particular solution
that satisﬁes a condition of the form 
. This is called an initial condition, and the
problem of ﬁnding a solution of the differential equation that satisﬁes the initial condition
is called an initial-value problem.
Geometrically, when we impose an initial condition, we look at the family of solution
curves and pick the one that passes through the point 
. Physically, this corresponds
to measuring the state of a system at time and using the solution of the initial-value prob-
lem to predict the future behavior of the system.
EXAMPLE 2 Find a solution of the differential equation 
that satisﬁes
the initial condition

SOLUTION Substituting the values 
and 
into the formula
from Example 1, we get
Solving this equation for c, we get

Unfortunately, it’s impossible to solve most differential equations in the sense of obtain-

of an explicit solution, we can still learn a lot about the solution through a graphical
approach (direction ﬁelds) or a numerical approach (Euler’s method).
DIRECTION FIELDS
Suppose we are asked to sketch the graph of the solution of the initial-value problem 
We don’t know a formula for the solution, so how can we possibly sketch its graph? Let’s
think about what the differential equation means. The equation 
tells us that the
slope at any point 
on the graph (called the solution curve) is equal to the sum of the 
x- and y-coordinates of the point (see Figure 1). In particular, because the curve passes
through the point 
, its slope there must be 
. So a small portion of the solu-
tion curve near the point 
looks like a short line segment through 
with slope 1.
(See Figure 2.)
As a guide to sketching the rest of the curve, let’s draw short line segments at a num-
ber of points 
with slope 
. The result is called a direction ﬁeld and is shown in
Figure 3. For instance, the line segment at the point 
has slope 
. The direc-
tion ﬁeld allows us to visualize the general shape of the solution curves by indicating the
direction in which the curves proceed at each point.

Now we can sketch the solution curve through the point 
by following the direc-
tion ﬁeld as in Figure 4. Notice that we have drawn the curve so that it is parallel to near-
by line segments.
In general, suppose we have a ﬁrst-order differential equation of the form
where 
is some expression in 
and . The differential equation says that the slope
of a solution curve at a point 
on the curve is 
. If we draw short line segments
with slope 
at several points 
, the result is called a direction ﬁeld (or slope
ﬁeld). These line segments indicate the direction in which a solution curve is heading, so
the direction ﬁeld helps us visualize the general shape of these curves.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) Sketch the direction ﬁeld for the differential equation 
.
(b) Use part (a) to sketch the solution curve that passes through the origin.
SOLUTION
(a) We start by computing the slope at several points in the following chart:
Now we draw short line segments with these slopes at these points. The result is the
direction ﬁeld shown in Figure 5.
(b) We start at the origin and move to the right in the direction of the line segment
(which has slope 
). We continue to draw the solution curve so that it moves parallel
to the nearby line segments. The resulting solution curve is shown in Figure 6. Returning
to the origin, we draw the solution curve to the left as well.
M
The more line segments we draw in a direction ﬁeld, the clearer the picture becomes.
Of course, it’s tedious to compute slopes and draw line segments for a huge number of
points by hand, but computers are well suited for this task. Figure 7 shows a more detailed,
computer-drawn direction ﬁeld for the differential equation in Example 1. It enables us to
draw, with reasonable accuracy, the solution curves shown in Figure 8 with -intercepts

Now let’s see how direction ﬁelds give insight into physical situations. The simple elec-
tric circuit shown in Figure 9 contains an electromotive force (usually a battery or gener-
ator) that produces a voltage of 
volts (V) and a current of 
amperes (A) at time t.
The circuit also contains a resistor with a resistance of R ohms (
) and an inductor with
an inductance of L henries (H).
Ohm’s Law gives the drop in voltage due to the resistor as RI. The voltage drop due to
the inductor is 
. One of Kirchhoff’s laws says that the sum of the voltage drops is
equal to the supplied voltage 
. Thus we have
which is a ﬁrst-order differential equation that models the current at time .
EXAMPLE 2 Suppose that in the simple circuit of Figure 9 the resistance is 
, the
inductance is 4 H, and a battery gives a constant voltage of 60 V.
(a) Draw a direction ﬁeld for Equation 1 with these values.
(b) What can you say about the limiting value of the current?
(c) Identify any equilibrium solutions.
(d) If the switch is closed when 
so the current starts with 
, use the direc-
tion ﬁeld to sketch the solution curve.
SOLUTION
(a) If we put 
,
, and 
in Equation 1, we get
The direction ﬁeld for this differential equation is shown in Figure 10.
(b) It appears from the direction ﬁeld that all solutions approach the value 5 A, that is,
(c) It appears that the constant function 
is an equilibrium solution. Indeed, we
can verify this directly from the differential equation 
. If

M
Notice from Figure 10 that the line segments along any horizontal line are parallel. That
is because the independent variable t does not occur on the right side of the equation
. In general, a differential equation of the form
in which the independent variable is missing from the right side, is called autonomous.
For such an equation, the slopes corresponding to two different points with the same 
y-coordinate must be equal. This means that if we know one solution to an autonomous
differential equation, then we can obtain inﬁnitely many others just by shifting the graph
of the known solution to the right or left. In Figure 11 we have shown the solutions 
that result from shifting the solution curve of Example 2 one and two time units (namely,
seconds) to the right. They correspond to closing the switch when 
or 
. 
EULER’S METHOD
The basic idea behind direction ﬁelds can be used to ﬁnd numerical approximations to
solutions of differential equations. We illustrate the method on the initial-value problem
that we used to introduce direction ﬁelds:
The differential equation tells us that 
, so the solution curve has slope
1 at the point 
. As a ﬁrst approximation to the solution we could use the linear approx-
imation 
. In other words, we could use the tangent line at 
as a rough
approximation to the solution curve (see Figure 12).
Euler’s idea was to improve on this approximation by proceeding only a short distance
along this tangent line and then making a midcourse correction by changing direction as
indicated by the direction ﬁeld. Figure 13 shows what happens if we start out along the
tangent line but stop when 
. (This horizontal distance traveled is called the step
size.) Since 
, we have 
and we take 
as the starting point
for a new line segment. The differential equation tells us that 
, so
we use the linear function

as an approximation to the solution for 
(the orange segment in Figure 13). If we
decrease the step size from 
to 
, we get the better Euler approximation shown in
Figure 14.
In general, Euler’s method says to start at the point given by the initial value and pro-
ceed in the direction indicated by the direction ﬁeld. Stop after a short time, look at the
slope at the new location, and proceed in that direction. Keep stopping and changing direc-
tion according to the direction ﬁeld. Euler’s method does not produce the exact solution to
an initial-value problem—it gives approximations. But by decreasing the step size (and
therefore increasing the number of midcourse corrections), we obtain successively better
approximations to the exact solution. (Compare Figures 12, 13, and 14.)
For the general ﬁrst-order initial-value problem 
,
, our aim is to
ﬁnd approximate values for the solution at equally spaced numbers 
,
,
, . . . , where is the step size. The differential equation tells us that the slope
at

, so Figure 15 shows that the approximate value of the solution

is
Similarly,
In general,

. So we have
This means that if 
is the exact solution, then 
.
Proceeding with similar calculations, we get the values in the table:
M
For a more accurate table of values in Example 3 we could decrease the step size. But
for a large number of small steps the amount of computation is considerable and so we
need to program a calculator or computer to carry out these calculations. The following
table shows the results of applying Euler’s method with decreasing step size to the initial-
value problem of Example 3.

CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
SEPARABLE EQUATIONS
We have looked at ﬁrst-order differential equations from a geometric point of view (direc-
tion ﬁelds) and from a numerical point of view (Euler’s method). What about the symbolic
point of view? It would be nice to have an explicit formula for a solution of a differential
equation. Unfortunately, that is not always possible. But in this section we examine a cer-
tain type of differential equation that can be solved explicitly.
A separable equation is a ﬁrst-order differential equation in which the expression for
can be factored as a function of x times a function of y. In other words, it can be
written in the form
The name separable comes from the fact that the expression on the right side can be “sep-
arated” into a function of and a function of . Equivalently, if 
, we could write
where 
. To solve this equation we rewrite it in the differential form
so that all ’s are on one side of the equation and all ’s are on the other side. Then we inte-
grate both sides of the equation:
Equation 2 deﬁnes implicitly as a function of . In some cases we may be able to solve
for in terms of .
We use the Chain Rule to justify this procedure: If and satisfy (2), then
so
and
Thus Equation 1 is satisﬁed.

N The technique for solving separable differen-
tial equations was ﬁrst used by James Bernoulli
(in 1690) in solving a problem about pendulums
and by Leibniz (in a letter to Huygens in 1691).
John Bernoulli explained the general method in a
paper published in 1694.

EXAMPLE 1
(a) Solve the differential equation 
.
(b) Find the solution of this equation that satisﬁes the initial condition 
.
SOLUTION
(a) We write the equation in terms of differentials and integrate both sides:
where 
is an arbitrary constant. (We could have used a constant 
on the left side and
another constant 
on the right side. But then we could combine these constants by
writing 
.)
Solving for , we get
We could leave the solution like this or we could write it in the form
where 
. (Since 
is an arbitrary constant, so is .)
(b) If we put 
in the general solution in part (a), we get 
. To satisfy the
initial condition 
, we must have 
and so 
.
Thus the solution of the initial-value problem is
M
EXAMPLE 2 Solve the differential equation 
.
SOLUTION Writing the equation in differential form and integrating both sides, we have
where 
is a constant. Equation 3 gives the general solution implicitly. In this case it’s
impossible to solve the equation to express explicitly as a function of .

ORTHOGONAL TRAJECTORIES
An orthogonal trajectory of a family of curves is a curve that intersects each curve of the
family orthogonally, that is, at right angles (see Figure 7). For instance, each member of
the family 
of straight lines through the origin is an orthogonal trajectory of the
family 
of concentric circles with center the origin (see Figure 8). We say that
the two families are orthogonal trajectories of each other.
EXAMPLE 5 Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of curves 
, where 
is an arbitrary constant.
SOLUTION The curves 
form a family of parabolas whose axis of symmetry is 
the -axis. The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a single differential equation that is satisﬁed by all

members of the family. If we differentiate 
, we get
This differential equation depends on , but we need an equation that is valid for all
values of simultaneously. To eliminate we note that, from the equation of the given
general parabola 
, we have 
and so the differential equation can be 
written as
or
This means that the slope of the tangent line at any point 
on one of the parabolas is
. On an orthogonal trajectory the slope of the tangent line must be the nega-
tive reciprocal of this slope. Therefore the orthogonal trajectories must satisfy the differ-
ential equation
This differential equation is separable, and we solve it as follows:
where 
is an arbitrary positive constant. Thus the orthogonal trajectories are the family
of ellipses given by Equation 4 and sketched in Figure 9.
M
Orthogonal trajectories occur in various branches of physics. For example, in an elec-
trostatic ﬁeld the lines of force are orthogonal to the lines of constant potential. Also,
the streamlines in aerodynamics are orthogonal trajectories of the velocity-equipotential
curves.
MIXING PROBLEMS
A typical mixing problem involves a tank of ﬁxed capacity ﬁlled with a thoroughly mixed
solution of some substance, such as salt. A solution of a given concentration enters the tank
at a ﬁxed rate and the mixture, thoroughly stirred, leaves at a ﬁxed rate, which may differ
from the entering rate. If 
denotes the amount of substance in the tank at time t, then
is the rate at which the substance is being added minus the rate at which it is being
removed. The mathematical description of this situation often leads to a ﬁrst-order sepa-
rable differential equation. We can use the same type of reasoning to model a variety of
phenomena: chemical reactions, discharge of pollutants into a lake, injection of a drug into
the bloodstream.

EXAMPLE 6 A tank contains 20 kg of salt dissolved in 5000 L of water. Brine that con-
tains 0.03 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 25 Lmin. The solution
is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. How much salt
remains in the tank after half an hour?
SOLUTION Let 
be the amount of salt (in kilograms) after minutes. We are given that
and we want to ﬁnd 
. We do this by ﬁnding a differential equation satis-
ﬁed by 
. Note that 
is the rate of change of the amount of salt, so
where (rate in) is the rate at which salt enters the tank and (rate out) is the rate at which
salt leaves the tank. We have
The tank always contains 5000 L of liquid, so the concentration at time is 
(measured in kilograms per liter). Since the brine ﬂows out at a rate of 25 Lmin, we
have
Thus, from Equation 5, we get
Solving this separable differential equation, we obtain
Since 
, we have 
, so
Therefore
Since 
is continuous and 
and the right side is never 0, we deduce that
is always positive. Thus 
and so
The amount of salt after 30 min is

If water (or other liquid) drains from a tank, we expect that the ﬂow will be greatest at ﬁrst (when
the water depth is greatest) and will gradually decrease as the water level decreases. But we need 
a more precise mathematical description of how the ﬂow decreases in order to answer the kinds 
of questions that engineers ask: How long does it take for a tank to drain completely? How much
water should a tank hold in order to guarantee a certain minimum water pressure for a sprinkler
system?
Let 
and 
be the height and volume of water in a tank at time . If water drains through a
hole with area 
at the bottom of the tank, then Torricelli’s Law says that
where is the acceleration due to gravity. So the rate at which water ﬂows from the tank is propor-
tional to the square root of the water height.
1. (a) Suppose the tank is cylindrical with height 6 ft and radius 2 ft and the hole is circular with
radius 1 inch. If we take 
fts , show that 
satisﬁes the differential equation
(b) Solve this equation to ﬁnd the height of the water at time , assuming the tank is full at 
time

CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

2. Because of the rotation and viscosity of the liquid, the theoretical model given by Equation 1
isn’t quite accurate. Instead, the model
is often used and the constant (which depends on the physical properties of the liquid) is
determined from data concerning the draining of the tank.
(a) Suppose that a hole is drilled in the side of a cylindrical bottle and the height 
of the
water (above the hole) decreases from 10 cm to 3 cm in 68 seconds. Use Equation 2 to
ﬁnd an expression for 
. Evaluate 
for 
.
(b) Drill a 4-mm hole near the bottom of the cylindrical part of a two-liter plastic soft-drink
bottle. Attach a strip of masking tape marked in centimeters from 0 to 10, with 0 corre-
sponding to the top of the hole. With one ﬁnger over the hole, ﬁll the bottle with water 
to the 10-cm mark. Then take your ﬁnger off the hole and record the values of 
for
seconds. (You will probably ﬁnd that it takes 68 seconds for the
level to decrease to 
.) Compare your data with the values of 
from part (a).
How well did the model predict the actual values?
3. In many parts of the world, the water for sprinkler systems in large hotels and hospitals is 
supplied by gravity from cylindrical tanks on or near the roofs of the buildings. Suppose 
such a tank has radius 10 ft and the diameter of the outlet is 2.5 inches. An engineer has to
guarantee that the water pressure will be at least 2160 
for a period of 10 minutes. (When
a ﬁre happens, the electrical system might fail and it could take up to 10 minutes for the emer-
gency generator and ﬁre pump to be activated.) What height should the engineer specify for
the tank in order to make such a guarantee? (Use the fact that the water pressure at a depth of
feet is 
. See Section 8.3.)
4. Not all water tanks are shaped like cylinders. Suppose a tank has cross-sectional area 
at
height . Then the volume of water up to height 
is 
and so the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus gives 
. It follows that
and so Torricelli’s Law becomes

N This part of the project is best done as a
classroom demonstration or as a group project
with three students in each group: a time-
keeper to call out seconds, a bottle keeper to
estimate the height every 10 seconds, and a
record keeper to record these values.

Suppose you throw a ball into the air. Do you think it takes longer to reach its maximum 
height or to fall back to earth from its maximum height? We will solve the problem in this proj-
ect but, before getting started, think about that situation and make a guess based on your physical
intuition.
1. A ball with mass 
is projected vertically upward from the earth’s surface with a positive
initial velocity . We assume the forces acting on the ball are the force of gravity and a
retarding force of air resistance with direction opposite to the direction of motion and with
magnitude 
, where 
is a positive constant and 
is the velocity of the ball at time .
In both the ascent and the descent, the total force acting on the ball is 
. [During
ascent,
is positive and the resistance acts downward; during descent,
is negative and
the resistance acts upward.] So, by Newton’s Second Law, the equation of motion is
Solve this differential equation to show that the velocity is
2. Show that the height of the ball, until it hits the ground, is
3. Let 
be the time that the ball takes to reach its maximum height. Show that
Find this time for a ball with mass 1 kg and initial velocity 20 ms. Assume the air
resistance is 
of the speed.
; 4. Let 
be the time at which the ball falls back to earth. For the particular ball in Problem 3,
estimate 
by using a graph of the height function 
. Which is faster, going up or coming
down?
5. In general, it’s not easy to ﬁnd 
because it’s impossible to solve the equation 
explicitly. We can, however, use an indirect method to determine whether ascent or descent
is faster; we determine whether 
is positive or negative. Show that
where 
. Then show that 
and the function
is increasing for 
. Use this result to decide whether 
is positive or negative. 
What can you conclude? Is ascent or descent faster?

CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
N In modeling force due to air resistance, 
various functions have been used, depending
on the physical characteristics and speed of
the ball. Here we use a linear model, 
, but
a quadratic model (
on the way up and
on the way down) is another possibility for
higher speeds (see Exercise 46 in Section 9.3).
For a golf ball, experiments have shown that a
good model is 
going up and 
coming down. But no matter which force func-
tion 
is used [where 
for 
and 
for

question remains the same. See F. Brauer,

MODELS FOR POPULATION GROWTH
In this section we investigate differential equations that are used to model population
growth: the law of natural growth, the logistic equation, and several others.
THE LAW OF NATURAL GROWTH
One of the models for population growth that we considered in Section 9.1 was based 
on the assumption that the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the 
population:
Is that a reasonable assumption? Suppose we have a population (of bacteria, for instance)
with size 
and at a certain time it is growing at a rate of 
bacteria per
hour. Now let’s take another 1000 bacteria of the same type and put them with the ﬁrst pop-
ulation. Each half of the new population was growing at a rate of 300 bacteria per hour.
We would expect the total population of 2000 to increase at a rate of 600 bacteria per 
hour initially (provided there’s enough room and nutrition). So if we double the size, we
double the growth rate. In general, it seems reasonable that the growth rate should be pro-
portional to the size.
In general, if 
is the value of a quantity 
at time and if the rate of change of 
with respect to is proportional to its size 
at any time, then
where
is a constant. Equation 1 is sometimes called the law of natural growth. If is pos-
itive, then the population increases; if is negative, it decreases.
Because Equation 1 is a separable differential equation, we can solve it by the methods
of Section 9.3:
where A (
or 0) is an arbitrary constant. To see the signiﬁcance of the constant A,
we observe that
Therefore A is the initial value of the function.
The solution of the initial-value problem

N Examples and exercises on the use of (2) are
given in Section 3.8.

Another way of writing Equation 1 is
which says that the relative growth rate (the growth rate divided by the population size)
is constant. Then (2) says that a population with constant relative growth rate must grow
exponentially.
We can account for emigration (or “harvesting”) from a population by modifying Equa-
tion 1: If the rate of emigration is a constant , then the rate of change of the population
is modeled by the differential equation
See Exercise 13 for the solution and consequences of Equation 3.
THE LOGISTIC MODEL
As we discussed in Section 9.1, a population often increases exponentially in its early
stages but levels off eventually and approaches its carrying capacity because of limited
resources. If 
is the size of the population at time t, we assume that
This says that the growth rate is initially close to being proportional to size. In other words,
the relative growth rate is almost constant when the population is small. But we also want
to reﬂect the fact that the relative growth rate decreases as the population P increases and
becomes negative if P ever exceeds its carrying capacity K, the maximum population that
the environment is capable of sustaining in the long run. The simplest expression for the
relative growth rate that incorporates these assumptions is
Multiplying by P, we obtain the model for population growth known as the logistic differ-
ential equation:
Notice from Equation 4 that if P is small compared with K, then 
is close to 0 and so
. However, if 
(the population approaches its carrying capacity), then
, so 
. We can deduce information about whether solutions increase or
decrease directly from Equation 4. If the population P lies between 0 and K, then the right
side of the equation is positive, so 
and the population increases. But if the pop-
ulation exceeds the carrying capacity 
, then 
is negative, so 
and the population decreases.
Let’s start our more detailed analysis of the logistic differential equation by looking at
a direction ﬁeld.

CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

EXAMPLE 1 Draw a direction ﬁeld for the logistic equation with 
and carry-
ing capacity 
. What can you deduce about the solutions?
SOLUTION In this case the logistic differential equation is
A direction ﬁeld for this equation is shown in Figure 1. We show only the ﬁrst quadrant
because negative populations aren’t meaningful and we are interested only in what hap-
pens after 
.
The logistic equation is autonomous (
depends only on P, not on t), so the
slopes are the same along any horizontal line. As expected, the slopes are positive for
and negative for 
.
The slopes are small when P is close to 0 or 1000 (the carrying capacity). Notice that
the solutions move away from the equilibrium solution 
and move toward the
equilibrium solution 
.
In Figure 2 we use the direction ﬁeld to sketch solution curves with initial populations
,
, and 
. Notice that solution curves that start below
are increasing and those that start above 
are decreasing. The slopes
are greatest when 
and therefore the solution curves that start below 
have inﬂection points when 
. In fact we can prove that all solution curves that
start below 
have an inﬂection point when P is exactly 500. (See Exercise 9.)

COMPARISON OF THE NATURAL GROWTH AND LOGISTIC MODELS
In the 1930s the biologist G. F. Gause conducted an experiment with the protozoan Para-
mecium and used a logistic equation to model his data. The table gives his daily count 
of the population of protozoa. He estimated the initial relative growth rate to be 0.7944 and
the carrying capacity to be 64.
EXAMPLE 3 Find the exponential and logistic models for Gause’s data. Compare the 
predicted values with the observed values and comment on the ﬁt.
SOLUTION Given the relative growth rate 
and the initial population 
, the
exponential model is
Gause used the same value of k for his logistic model. [This is reasonable because
is small compared with the carrying capacity (
). The equation
shows that the value of k for the logistic model is very close to the value for the expo-
nential model.]
Then the solution of the logistic equation in Equation 7 gives
where
So
We use these equations to calculate the predicted values (rounded to the nearest integer)
and compare them in the following table.
We notice from the table and from the graph in Figure 4 that for the ﬁrst three or four
days the exponential model gives results comparable to those of the more sophisticated
logistic model. For 
, however, the exponential model is hopelessly inaccurate, but
the logistic model ﬁts the observations reasonably well.

Many countries that formerly experienced exponential growth are now ﬁnding that their
rates of population growth are declining and the logistic model provides a better model.
The table in the margin shows midyear values of 
, the population of Belgium, in thou-
sands, at time , from 1980 to 2000. Figure 5 shows these data points together with a
shifted logistic function obtained from a calculator with the ability to ﬁt a logistic function
to these points by regression. We see that the logistic model provides a very good ﬁt.
OTHER MODELS FOR POPULATION GROWTH
The Law of Natural Growth and the logistic differential equation are not the only equa-
tions that have been proposed to model population growth. In Exercise 18 we look at the
Gompertz growth function and in Exercises 19 and 20 we investigate seasonal-growth
models.
Two of the other models are modiﬁcations of the logistic model. The differential 
equation
has been used to model populations that are subject to harvesting of one sort or another.
(Think of a population of ﬁsh being caught at a constant rate.) This equation is explored
in Exercises 15 and 16.
For some species there is a minimum population level m below which the species tends
to become extinct. (Adults may not be able to ﬁnd suitable mates.) Such populations have
been modeled by the differential equation
where the extra factor, 
, takes into account the consequences of a sparse popula-
tion (see Exercise 17).

CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

In this project we explore three of the many applications of calculus to baseball. The physical
interactions of the game, especially the collision of ball and bat, are quite complex and their
models are discussed in detail in a book by Robert Adair, The Physics of Baseball, 3d ed. 
(New York: HarperPerennial, 2002).
1. It may surprise you to learn that the collision of baseball and bat lasts only about a thou-
sandth of a second. Here we calculate the average force on the bat during this collision by
ﬁrst computing the change in the ball’s momentum.
The 
of an object is the product of its mass 
and its velocity , that is,
. Suppose an object, moving along a straight line, is acted on by a force 
that is a continuous function of time.
(a) Show that the change in momentum over a time interval 
is equal to the integral 
of 
from 
to ; that is, show that
This integral is called the impulse of the force over the time interval.
(b) A pitcher throws a 90-mih fastball to a batter, who hits a line drive directly back 
to the pitcher. The ball is in contact with the bat for 0.001 s and leaves the bat with
velocity 110 mih. A baseball weighs 5 oz and, in US Customary units, its mass is
measured in slugs: 
where 
.
(i) Find the change in the ball’s momentum.
(ii) Find the average force on the bat.
2. In this problem we calculate the work required for a pitcher to throw a 90-mih fastball by
ﬁrst considering kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy
of an object of mass 
and velocity is given by 
. Sup-
pose an object of mass , moving in a straight line, is acted on by a force 
that
depends on its position . According to Newton’s Second Law
where 
and denote the acceleration and velocity of the object. 
(a) Show that the work done in moving the object from a position 
to a position 
is equal
to the change in the object’s kinetic energy; that is, show that
where 
and 
are the velocities of the object at the positions 
and .
Hint: By the Chain Rule, 
(b) How many foot-pounds of work does it take to throw a baseball at a speed of 90 mih?
3. (a) An outﬁelder ﬁelds a baseball 280 ft away from home plate and throws it directly to the
catcher with an initial velocity of 100 fts. Assume that the velocity 
of the ball after
seconds satisﬁes the differential equation 
because of air resistance. How
long does it take for the ball to reach home plate? (Ignore any vertical motion of the
ball.)
(b) The manager of the team wonders whether the ball will reach home plate sooner if it 
is relayed by an inﬁelder. The shortstop can position himself directly between the out-
ﬁelder and home plate, catch the ball thrown by the outﬁelder, turn, and throw the ball to

CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
LINEAR EQUATIONS
A ﬁrst-order linear differential equation is one that can be put into the form
where 
and 
are continuous functions on a given interval. This type of equation occurs
frequently in various sciences, as we will see.
An example of a linear equation is 
because, for 
, it can be written
in the form
Notice that this differential equation is not separable because it’s impossible to factor the
expression for 
as a function of x times a function of y. But we can still solve the equa-
tion by noticing, by the Product Rule, that
and so we can rewrite the equation as
If we now integrate both sides of this equation, we get
or
If we had been given the differential equation in the form of Equation 2, we would have
had to take the preliminary step of multiplying each side of the equation by x.
It turns out that every ﬁrst-order linear differential equation can be solved in a similar
fashion by multiplying both sides of Equation 1 by a suitable function 
called an 
integrating factor. We try to ﬁnd so that the left side of Equation 1, when multiplied by
, becomes the derivative of the product 
:
If we can ﬁnd such a function , then Equation 1 becomes

Integrating both sides, we would have
so the solution would be
To ﬁnd such an , we expand Equation 3 and cancel terms:
This is a separable differential equation for , which we solve as follows:
where 
. We are looking for a particular integrating factor, not the most general
one, so we take 
and use
Thus a formula for the general solution to Equation 1 is provided by Equation 4, where 
is given by Equation 5. Instead of memorizing this formula, however, we just remember
the form of the integrating factor.
To solve the linear differential equation 
, multiply both sides by
the integrating factor
and integrate both sides.
EXAMPLE 1 Solve the differential equation

APPLICATION TO ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
In Section 9.2 we considered the simple electric circuit shown in Figure 4: An electro-
motive force (usually a battery or generator) produces a voltage of 
volts (V) and a cur-
rent of 
amperes (A) at time . The circuit also contains a resistor with a resistance of
ohms ( ) and an inductor with an inductance of 
henries (H).
Ohm’s Law gives the drop in voltage due to the resistor as 
. The voltage drop due to
the inductor is 
. One of Kirchhoff’s laws says that the sum of the voltage drops is
equal to the supplied voltage 
. Thus we have
which is a ﬁrst-order linear differential equation. The solution gives the current
at time .
EXAMPLE 4 Suppose that in the simple circuit of Figure 4 the resistance is 
and
the inductance is 4 H. If a battery gives a constant voltage of 60 V and the switch is

CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEMS
We have looked at a variety of models for the growth of a single species that lives alone in
an environment. In this section we consider more realistic models that take into account
the interaction of two species in the same habitat. We will see that these models take the
form of a pair of linked differential equations.
We ﬁrst consider the situation in which one species, called the prey, has an ample food
supply and the second species, called the predator, feeds on the prey. Examples of prey and
predators include rabbits and wolves in an isolated forest, food ﬁsh and sharks, aphids and
ladybugs, and bacteria and amoebas. Our model will have two dependent variables and
both are functions of time. We let 
be the number of prey (using R for rabbits) and 
be the number of predators (with W for wolves) at time t.
In the absence of predators, the ample food supply would support exponential growth
of the prey, that is,
In the absence of prey, we assume that the predator population would decline at a rate pro-
portional to itself, that is,
With both species present, however, we assume that the principal cause of death among the
prey is being eaten by a predator, and the birth and survival rates of the predators depend
on their available food supply, namely, the prey. We also assume that the two species
encounter each other at a rate that is proportional to both populations and is therefore pro-
portional to the product RW. (The more there are of either population, the more encoun-
ters there are likely to be.) A system of two differential equations that incorporates these
assumptions is as follows:
where k, r, a, and b are positive constants. Notice that the term aRW decreases the nat-
ural growth rate of the prey and the term bRW increases the natural growth rate of the 
predators.

W represents the predator.
R represents the prey.

The equations in (1) are known as the predator-prey equations, or the Lotka-Volterra
equations. A solution of this system of equations is a pair of functions 
and 
that
describe the populations of prey and predator as functions of time. Because the system is
coupled (R and W occur in both equations), we can’t solve one equation and then the other;
we have to solve them simultaneously. Unfortunately, it is usually impossible to ﬁnd
explicit formulas for R and W as functions of t. We can, however, use graphical methods
to analyze the equations. 
EXAMPLE 1 Suppose that populations of rabbits and wolves are described by the
Lotka-Volterra equations (1) with 
, 
, 
, and 
. The
time is measured in months.
(a) Find the constant solutions (called the equilibrium solutions) and interpret 
the answer.
(b) Use the system of differential equations to ﬁnd an expression for 
.
(c) Draw a direction ﬁeld for the resulting differential equation in the RW-plane. Then
use that direction ﬁeld to sketch some solution curves.
(d) Suppose that, at some point in time, there are 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves. Draw the
corresponding solution curve and use it to describe the changes in both population levels.
(e) Use part (d) to make sketches of R and W as functions of t.
SOLUTION
(a) With the given values of k, a, r, and b, the Lotka-Volterra equations become
Both R and W will be constant if both derivatives are 0, that is,
One solution is given by R  0 and W  0. (This makes sense: If there are no rabbits or
wolves, the populations are certainly not going to increase.) The other constant solution is
So the equilibrium populations consist of 80 wolves and 1000 rabbits. This means that
1000 rabbits are just enough to support a constant wolf population of 80. There are 
neither too many wolves (which would result in fewer rabbits) nor too few wolves
(which would result in more rabbits).

N The Lotka-Volterra equations were proposed
as a model to explain the variations in the shark
and food-ﬁsh populations in the Adriatic Sea 
by the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra
(1860–1940).

(c) If we think of W as a function of R, we have the differential equation
We draw the direction ﬁeld for this differential equation in Figure 1 and we use it to
sketch several solution curves in Figure 2. If we move along a solution curve, we
observe how the relationship between R and W changes as time passes. Notice that the
curves appear to be closed in the sense that if we travel along a curve, we always return
to the same point. Notice also that the point (1000, 80) is inside all the solution curves.
That point is called an equilibrium point because it corresponds to the equilibrium solu-
tion R  1000, W  80.
When we represent solutions of a system of differential equations as in Figure 2, we
refer to the RW-plane as the phase plane, and we call the solution curves phase trajec-
tories. So a phase trajectory is a path traced out by solutions 
as time goes by. A
phase portrait consists of equilibrium points and typical phase trajectories, as shown in
Figure 2.
(d) Starting with 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves corresponds to drawing the solution curve
through the point 
. Figure 3 shows this phase trajectory with the direction
ﬁeld removed. Starting at the point 
at time
and letting increase, do we move
clockwise or counterclockwise around the phase trajectory? If we put

in the ﬁrst differential equation, we get
Since 
, we conclude that R is increasing at 
and so we move counter-
clockwise around the phase trajectory.
We see that at 
there aren’t enough wolves to maintain a balance between the popu-
lations, so the rabbit population increases. That results in more wolves and eventually
there are so many wolves that the rabbits have a hard time avoiding them. So the number
of rabbits begins to decline (at 
, where we estimate that R reaches its maximum popu-
lation of about 2800). This means that at some later time the wolf population starts to
fall (at 
, where 
and 
). But this beneﬁts the rabbits, so their popula-
tion later starts to increase (at 
, where 
and 
). As a consequence, the
wolf population eventually starts to increase as well. This happens when the populations
return to their initial values of 
and 
, and the entire cycle begins again.
(e) From the description in part (d) of how the rabbit and wolf populations rise and fall,
we can sketch the graphs of 
and 
. Suppose the points 
, 
, and 
in Figure 3
are reached at times , , and . Then we can sketch graphs of R and W as in Figure 4.
To make the graphs easier to compare, we draw the graphs on the same axes but with
different scales for R and W, as in Figure 5. Notice that the rabbits reach their maximum
populations about a quarter of a cycle before the wolves.

TEC

An important part of the modeling process, as we discussed in Section 1.2, is to inter-
pret our mathematical conclusions as real-world predictions and to test the predictions
against real data. The Hudson’s Bay Company, which started trading in animal furs in
Canada in 1670, has kept records that date back to the 1840s. Figure 6 shows graphs of the
number of pelts of the snowshoe hare and its predator, the Canada lynx, traded by the com-
pany over a 90-year period. You can see that the coupled oscillations in the hare and lynx
populations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra model do actually occur and the period of
these cycles is roughly 10 years.
Although the relatively simple Lotka-Volterra model has had some success in explain-
ing and predicting coupled populations, more sophisticated models have also been pro-
posed. One way to modify the Lotka-Volterra equations is to assume that, in the absence
of predators, the prey grow according to a logistic model with carrying capacity K. Then
the Lotka-Volterra equations (1) are replaced by the system of differential equations
This model is investigated in Exercises 9 and 10.
Models have also been proposed to describe and predict population levels of two
species that compete for the same resources or cooperate for mutual beneﬁt. Such models
are explored in Exercise 2.

CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
2. Each system of differential equations is a model for two
species that either compete for the same resources or cooperate
for mutual beneﬁt (ﬂowering plants and insect pollinators, for
instance). Decide whether each system describes competition
or cooperation and explain why it is a reasonable model. (Ask
yourself what effect an increase in one species has on the
growth rate of the other.)

implicitly as a function of

for describing curves.
Some curves, such as the cycloid, are best handled when both and are given in
terms of a third variable called a parameter 
. Other curves, such as
the cardioid, have their most convenient description when we use a new coordinate
system, called the polar coordinate system.

describe C by an equation of the form 
because C fails the Vertical Line Test. But
the x- and y-coordinates of the particle are functions of time and so we can write 
and 
. Such a pair of equations is often a convenient way of describing a curve and
gives rise to the following deﬁnition.
Suppose that and are both given as functions of a third variable (called a param-
eter) by the equations
(called parametric equations). Each value of determines a point 
, which we can
plot in a coordinate plane. As varies, the point 
varies and traces out
a curve , which we call a parametric curve. The parameter t does not necessarily repre-
sent time and, in fact, we could use a letter other than t for the parameter. But in many
applications of parametric curves, t does denote time and therefore we can interpret
as the position of a particle at time t.
EXAMPLE 1 Sketch and identify the curve deﬁned by the parametric equations
SOLUTION Each value of gives a point on the curve, as shown in the table. For instance, if
, then 
, 
and so the corresponding point is 
. In Figure 2 we plot the
points 
determined by several values of the parameter and we join them to produce
a curve.
A particle whose position is given by the parametric equations moves along the curve
in the direction of the arrows as increases. Notice that the consecutive points marked on
the curve appear at equal time intervals but not at equal distances. That is because the
particle slows down and then speeds up as increases.
It appears from Figure 2 that the curve traced out by the particle may be a parabola.
This can be conﬁrmed by eliminating the parameter as follows. We obtain 
from the second equation and substitute into the ﬁrst equation. This gives
and so the curve represented by the given parametric equations is the parabola
.

No restriction was placed on the parameter in Example 1, so we assumed that t could
be any real number. But sometimes we restrict t to lie in a ﬁnite interval. For instance, the
parametric curve
shown in Figure 3 is the part of the parabola in Example 1 that starts at the point 
and
ends at the point 
. The arrowhead indicates the direction in which the curve is traced
as increases from 0 to 4.
In general, the curve with parametric equations
has initial point 
and terminal point
.
EXAMPLE 2 What curve is represented by the following parametric equations?
SOLUTION If we plot points, it appears that the curve is a circle. We can conﬁrm this
impression by eliminating 
Observe that
Thus the point 
moves on the unit circle 
. Notice that in this example
the parameter can be interpreted as the angle (in radians) shown in Figure 4. As 
increases from 0 to 
, the point 
moves once around the circle in
the counterclockwise direction starting from the point 
.
M
EXAMPLE 3 What curve is represented by the given parametric equations?
SOLUTION Again we have
so the parametric equations again represent the unit circle 
. But as 
increases from 0 to 
, the point 
starts at 
and moves twice
around the circle in the clockwise direction as indicated in Figure 5.
M
Examples 2 and 3 show that different sets of parametric equations can represent the
same curve. Thus we distinguish between a curve, which is a set of points, and a parametric
curve, in which the points are traced in a particular way.

sions for and by , we get

represent a circle with radius and center the origin traced counterclockwise. We now
shift units in the -direction and units in the -direction and obtain parametric equa-
tions of the circle (Figure 6) with center

GRAPHING DEVICES
Most graphing calculators and computer graphing programs can be used to graph curves
deﬁned by parametric equations. In fact, it’s instructive to watch a parametric curve being
drawn by a graphing calculator because the points are plotted in order as the correspon-
ding parameter values increase.
EXAMPLE 6 Use a graphing device to graph the curve 
.
SOLUTION If we let the parameter be 
, then we have the equations
Using these parametric equations to graph the curve, we obtain Figure 9. It would be
possible to solve the given equation 
for y as four functions of x and
graph them individually, but the parametric equations provide a much easier method.
M
In general, if we need to graph an equation of the form 
, we can use the para-
metric equations
Notice also that curves with equations 
(the ones we are most familiar with—
graphs of functions) can also be regarded as curves with parametric equations
Graphing devices are particularly useful when sketching complicated curves. For 
instance, the curves shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12 would be virtually impossible to pro-
duce by hand.
One of the most important uses of parametric curves is in computer-aided design
(CAD). In the Laboratory Project after Section 10.2 we will investigate special parametric
curves, called Bézier curves, that are used extensively in manufacturing, especially in the
automotive industry. These curves are also employed in specifying the shapes of letters and
other symbols in laser printers.
THE CYCLOID
EXAMPLE 7 The curve traced out by a point 
on the circumference of a circle as the
circle rolls along a straight line is called a cycloid (see Figure 13). If the circle has
radius and rolls along the -axis and if one position of 
is the origin, ﬁnd parametric
equations for the cycloid.

SOLUTION We choose as parameter the angle of rotation 
of the circle 
when 
is at
the origin). Suppose the circle has rotated through 
radians. Because the circle has been
in contact with the line, we see from Figure 14 that the distance it has rolled from the
origin is
Therefore the center of the circle is 
. Let the coordinates of 
be 
. Then
from Figure 14 we see that
Therefore parametric equations of the cycloid are
One arch of the cycloid comes from one rotation of the circle and so is described by
. Although Equations 1 were derived from Figure 14, which illustrates the
case where 
, it can be seen that these equations are still valid for other
values of (see Exercise 39).
Although it is possible to eliminate the parameter 
from Equations 1, the resulting
Cartesian equation in and is very complicated and not as convenient to work with as
the parametric equations.
M
One of the ﬁrst people to study the cycloid was Galileo, who proposed that bridges be
built in the shape of cycloids and who tried to ﬁnd the area under one arch of a cycloid.
Later this curve arose in connection with the brachistochrone problem: Find the curve
along which a particle will slide in the shortest time (under the inﬂuence of gravity) from
a point 
to a lower point 
not directly beneath 
. The Swiss mathematician John
Bernoulli, who posed this problem in 1696, showed that among all possible curves that
join 
to , as in Figure 15, the particle will take the least time sliding from 
to 
if the
curve is part of an inverted arch of a cycloid.
The Dutch physicist Huygens had already shown that the cycloid is also the solution to
the tautochrone problem; that is, no matter where a particle 
is placed on an inverted
cycloid, it takes the same time to slide to the bottom (see Figure 16). Huygens proposed
that pendulum clocks (which he invented) swing in cycloidal arcs because then the pendu-
lum takes the same time to make a complete oscillation whether it swings through a wide
or a small arc.

SOLUTION We use a graphing device to produce the graphs for the cases 
, 
,
, 
, , 
, , and 
shown in Figure 17. Notice that all of these curves (except
the case 
) have two branches, and both branches approach the vertical asymptote
as approaches from the left or right.
When 
, both branches are smooth; but when reaches 
, the right branch
acquires a sharp point, called a cusp. For between 
and 0 the cusp turns into a loop,
which becomes larger as approaches 0. When 
, both branches come together and
form a circle (see Example 2). For between 0 and 1, the left branch has a loop, which
shrinks to become a cusp when 
. For 
, the branches become smooth again,
and as increases further, they become less curved. Notice that the curves with posi-
tive are reﬂections about the -axis of the corresponding curves with negative.
These curves are called conchoids of Nicomedes after the ancient Greek scholar
Nicomedes. He called them conchoids because the shape of their outer branches 
resembles that of a conch shell or mussel shell.

In this project we investigate families of curves, called hypocycloids and epicycloids, that are
generated by the motion of a point on a circle that rolls inside or outside another circle.
1. A hypocycloid is a curve traced out by a ﬁxed point P on a circle C of radius b as C rolls on
the inside of a circle with center O and radius a. Show that if the initial position of P is 
and the parameter 
is chosen as in the ﬁgure, then parametric equations of the hypocycloid
are

CALCULUS WITH PARAMETRIC CURVES
Having seen how to represent curves by parametric equations, we now apply the methods
of calculus to these parametric curves. In particular, we solve problems involving tangents,
area, arc length, and surface area.
TANGENTS
In the preceding section we saw that some curves deﬁned by parametric equations 
and 
can also be expressed, by eliminating the parameter, in the form 
.
(See Exercise 67 for general conditions under which this is possible.) If we substitute
and 
in the equation 
, we get
and so, if ,
, and 
are differentiable, the Chain Rule gives
If 
, we can solve for 
:
Since the slope of the tangent to the curve 
at 
is 
, Equation 1
enables us to ﬁnd tangents to parametric curves without having to eliminate the parameter.
Using Leibniz notation, we can rewrite Equation 1 in an easily remembered form:
It can be seen from Equation 2 that the curve has a horizontal tangent when 
(provided that 
) and it has a vertical tangent when 
(provided that
). This information is useful for sketching parametric curves.

N If we think of a parametric curve as being
traced out by a moving particle, then 
and
are the vertical and horizontal velocities
of the particle and Formula 2 says that the slope
of the tangent is the ratio of these velocities.

dydt

As we know from Chapter 4, it is also useful to consider 
. This can be found by
replacing y by dydx in Equation 2:
EXAMPLE 1 A curve 
is deﬁned by the parametric equations 
,
(a) Show that 
has two tangents at the point (3, 0) and ﬁnd their equations.
(b) Find the points on 
where the tangent is horizontal or vertical.
(c) Determine where the curve is concave upward or downward.
(d) Sketch the curve.
SOLUTION
(a) Notice that

. Therefore the
point 
on 
arises from two values of the parameter,
and

indicates that

the slope of the tangent when

tions of the tangents at 
are
(b)

Since

. The corresponding
points on 
are 
and (1, 2). 
has a vertical tangent when 
, that is,
.  (Note that 
there.) The corresponding point on 
is (0, 0).
(c) To determine concavity we calculate the second derivative:
Thus the curve is concave upward when 
and concave downward when 
.
(d) Using the information from parts (b) and (c), we sketch 
in Figure 1.

ARC LENGTH
We already know how to ﬁnd the length

Suppose that

right, as increases from

3 and using the Substitution Rule, we obtain
Since 
, we have
Even if 
can’t be expressed in the form 
, Formula 4 is still valid but we obtain
it by polygonal approximations. We divide the parameter interval 
into n subintervals
of equal width

N The result of Example 3 says that the area
under one arch of the cycloid is three times the
area of the rolling circle that generates the
cycloid (see Example 7 in Section 10.1). Galileo
guessed this result but it was ﬁrst proved by the
French mathematician Roberval and the Italian
mathematician Torricelli.

| Notice that the integral gives twice the arc length of the circle because as increases
from 0 to

traverses the circle twice. In general, when ﬁnding
the length of a curve

that 
is traversed only once as increases from

surface area. If the curve given by the parametric equations

N The result of Example 5 says that the length of
one arch of a cycloid is eight times the radius of
the generating circle (see Figure 5). This was ﬁrst
proved in 1658 by Sir Christopher Wren, who
later became the architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral
in London.

CHAPTER 10 PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS AND POLAR COORDINATES

The Bézier curves are used in computer-aided design and are named after the French mathema-
tician Pierre Bézier (1910–1999), who worked in the automotive industry. A cubic Bézier curve 
is determined by four control points,
and 
, and is 
deﬁned by the parametric equations
where 
. Notice that when 
we have 
and when 
we have
, so the curve starts at 
and ends at 
.
1.
Graph the Bézier curve with control points 
,
,
, and 
Then, on the same screen, graph the line segments 
,
, and 
. (Exercise 31 in 
Section 10.1 shows how to do this.) Notice that the middle control points 
and 
don’t lie
on the curve; the curve starts at 
, heads toward 
and 
without reaching them, and ends 
at 
2.
From the graph in Problem 1, it appears that the tangent at 
passes through 
and the 
tangent at 
passes through 
. Prove it.
3.
Try to produce a Bézier curve with a loop by changing the second control point in 
Problem 1.
4.
Some laser printers use Bézier curves to represent letters and other symbols. Experiment 
with control points until you ﬁnd a Bézier curve that gives a reasonable representation of the 
letter C.
5.
More complicated shapes can be represented by piecing together two or more Bézier curves.
Suppose the ﬁrst Bézier curve has control points 
and the second one has con-
trol points 
. If we want these two pieces to join together smoothly, then the
tangents at 
should match and so the points 
,
, and 
all have to lie on this common
tangent line. Using this principle, ﬁnd control points for a pair of Bézier curves that repre-
sent the letter S.

SECTION 10.3 POLAR COORDINATES

POLAR COORDINATES
A coordinate system represents a point in the plane by an ordered pair of numbers called
coordinates. Usually we use Cartesian coordinates, which are directed distances from two
perpendicular axes. Here we describe a coordinate system introduced by Newton, called
the polar coordinate system, which is more convenient for many purposes.
We choose a point in the plane that is called the pole (or origin) and is labeled . Then
we draw a ray (half-line) starting at 
called the polar axis. This axis is usually drawn hor-
izontally to the right and corresponds to the positive -axis in Cartesian coordinates.
If 
is any other point in the plane, let be the distance from 
to 
and let 
be the
angle (usually measured in radians) between the polar axis and the line 
as in Figure 1.
Then the point 
is represented by the ordered pair 
and ,
are called polar coordi-
nates of . We use the convention that an angle is positive if measured in the counter-
clockwise direction from the polar axis and negative in the clockwise direction. If
,
then 
and we agree that 
represents the pole for any value of .

We extend the meaning of polar coordinates 
to the case in which is negative by
agreeing that, as in Figure 2, the points 
and 
lie on the same line through 
and at the same distance 
from , but on opposite sides of . If 
, the point 
lies in the same quadrant as ; if 
, it lies in the quadrant on the opposite side of the
pole. Notice that 
represents the same point as 
.
EXAMPLE 1 Plot the points whose polar coordinates are given.
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
SOLUTION The points are plotted in Figure 3. In part (d) the point 
is located
three units from the pole in the fourth quadrant because the angle 
is in the second
quadrant and 
is negative.
M
In the Cartesian coordinate system every point has only one representation, but in the
polar coordinate system each point has many representations. For instance, the point
in Example 1(a) could be written as 
or 
or 
.
(See Figure 4.)
In fact, since a complete counterclockwise rotation is given by an angle 2 , the point
represented by polar coordinates 
is also represented by
where is any integer.
The connection between polar and Cartesian coordinates can be seen from Figure 5, in
which the pole corresponds to the origin and the polar axis coincides with the positive 
-axis. If the point 
has Cartesian coordinates 
and polar coordinates 
, then,
from the ﬁgure, we have
and so
Although Equations 1 were deduced from Figure 5, which illustrates the case where
and

Equations 1 allow us to ﬁnd the Cartesian coordinates of a point when the polar coor-
dinates are known. To ﬁnd and when and are known, we use the equations
which can be deduced from Equations 1 or simply read from Figure 5.
EXAMPLE 2 Convert the point 
from polar to Cartesian coordinates.
SOLUTION Since 
and 
, Equations 1 give
Therefore the point is 
in Cartesian coordinates.
M
EXAMPLE 3 Represent the point with Cartesian coordinates 
in terms of polar
coordinates.
SOLUTION If we choose to be positive, then Equations 2 give
Since the point 
lies in the fourth quadrant, we can choose 
or
. Thus one possible answer is 
; another is 
.
M
Equations 2 do not uniquely determine 
when and are given because, as 
increases through the interval 
, each value of 
occurs twice. Therefore, in
converting from Cartesian to polar coordinates, it’s not good enough just to ﬁnd 
and 
that satisfy Equations 2. As in Example 3, we must choose 
so that the point 
lies in
the correct quadrant.
POLAR CURVES
The graph of a polar equation
, or more generally 
, consists of all
points 
that have at least one polar representation 
whose coordinates satisfy the
equation.
EXAMPLE 4 What curve is represented by the polar equation 
?
SOLUTION The curve consists of all points 
with 
. Since represents the distance
from the point to the pole, the curve 
represents the circle with center 
and radius
. In general, the equation 
represents a circle with center 
and radius 
. (See
Figure 6.)

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the polar curve 
.
SOLUTION This curve consists of all points 
such that the polar angle 
is 1 radian. It 
is the straight line that passes through 
and makes an angle of 1 radian with the polar
axis (see Figure 7). Notice that the points 
on the line with 
are in the ﬁrst
quadrant, whereas those with 
are in the third quadrant.

EXAMPLE 6
(a) Sketch the curve with polar equation 
.
(b) Find a Cartesian equation for this curve.
SOLUTION
(a) In Figure 8 we ﬁnd the values of for some convenient values of and plot the
corresponding points 
. Then we join these points to sketch the curve, which appears
to be a circle. We have used only values of 
between 0 and , since if we let 
increase
beyond , we obtain the same points again.
(b) To convert the given equation to a Cartesian equation we use Equations 1 and 2.
From 
we have 
, so the equation 
becomes 
,
which gives 
or
Completing the square, we obtain
which is an equation of a circle with center 
and radius 1.

EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION Instead of plotting points as in Example 6, we ﬁrst sketch the graph of
in Cartesian coordinates in Figure 10 by shifting the sine curve up one
unit. This enables us to read at a glance the values of that correspond to increasing 
values of . For instance, we see that as 
increases from 0 to 
, (the distance from )
increases from 1 to 2, so we sketch the corresponding part of the polar curve in Figure
11(a). As
increases from 
to , Figure 10 shows that decreases from 2 to 1, so we
sketch the next part of the curve as in Figure 11(b). As 
increases from 
to 
, 
decreases from 1 to 0 as shown in part (c). Finally, as 
increases from 
to 
, 
increases from 0 to 1 as shown in part (d). If we let 
increase beyond 
or decrease
beyond 0, we would simply retrace our path. Putting together the parts of the curve from
Figure 11(a)–(d), we sketch the complete curve in part (e). It is called a cardioid,
because it’s shaped like a heart.
M
EXAMPLE 8 Sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION As in Example 7, we ﬁrst sketch 
, 
, in Cartesian coordi-
nates in Figure 12. As 
increases from 0 to 
, Figure 12 shows that decreases from
1 to 0 and so we draw the corresponding portion of the polar curve in Figure 13 (indi-
cated by !). As 
increases from 
to 
, goes from 0 to 
. This means that the
distance from 
increases from 0 to 1, but instead of being in the ﬁrst quadrant this por-
tion of the polar curve (indicated by @) lies on the opposite side of the pole in the third
quadrant. The remainder of the curve is drawn in a similar fashion, with the arrows and
numbers indicating the order in which the portions are traced out. The resulting curve
has four loops and is called a four-leaved rose.

SYMMETRY
When we sketch polar curves, it is sometimes helpful to take advantage of symmetry. The
following three rules are explained by Figure 14.
(a) If a polar equation is unchanged when 
is replaced by 
, the curve is symmetric
about the polar axis.
(b) If the equation is unchanged when is replaced by 
, or when 
is replaced by
, the curve is symmetric about the pole. (This means that the curve remains
unchanged if we rotate it through 180° about the origin.)
(c) If the equation is unchanged when 
is replaced by 
, the curve is symmetric
about the vertical line 
.
The curves sketched in Examples 6 and 8 are symmetric about the polar axis, since
. The curves in Examples 7 and 8 are symmetric about 
because
and 
. The four-leaved rose is also symmetric
about the pole. These symmetry properties could have been used in sketching the curves.
For instance, in Example 6 we need only have plotted points for 
and then
reﬂected about the polar axis to obtain the complete circle.
TANGENTS TO POLAR CURVES
To ﬁnd a tangent line to a polar curve 
, we regard 
as a parameter and write its
parametric equations as
Then, using the method for ﬁnding slopes of parametric curves (Equation 10.2.2) and the
Product Rule, we have
We locate horizontal tangents by ﬁnding the points where 
(provided that
). Likewise, we locate vertical tangents at the points where 
(pro-
vided that 
).

By symmetry,
Thus there is a vertical tangent line at the pole (see Figure 15).

Instead of having to remember Equation 3, we could employ the method used
to derive it. For instance, in Example 9 we could have written
Then we would have
which is equivalent to our previous expression.
GRAPHING POLAR CURVES WITH GRAPHING DEVICES
Although it’s useful to be able to sketch simple polar curves by hand, we need to use a
graphing calculator or computer when we are faced with a curve as complicated as the ones
shown in Figures 16 and 17.
Some graphing devices have commands that enable us to graph polar curves directly.
With other machines we need to convert to parametric equations ﬁrst. In this case we take
the polar equation 
and write its parametric equations as
Some machines require that the parameter be called rather than .
EXAMPLE 10 Graph the curve 
.
SOLUTION Let’s assume that our graphing device doesn’t have a built-in polar graphing
command. In this case we need to work with the corresponding parametric equations,
which are
In any case, we need to determine the domain for . So we ask ourselves: How many
complete rotations are required until the curve starts to repeat itself? If the answer is 
, then

and so we require that 
be an even multiple of . This will ﬁrst occur when
. Therefore we will graph the entire curve if we specify that 
.
Switching from 
to , we have the equations
and Figure 18 shows the resulting curve. Notice that this rose has 16 loops.

EXAMPLE 11 Investigate the family of polar curves given by 
. How
does the shape change as changes? (These curves are called limaçons, after a French
word for snail, because of the shape of the curves for certain values of .)
SOLUTION Figure 19 shows computer-drawn graphs for various values of . For 
there
is a loop that decreases in size as decreases. When 
the loop disappears and the
curve becomes the cardioid that we sketched in Example 7. For between 1 and the
cardioid’s cusp is smoothed out and becomes a “dimple.” When decreases from to ,
the limaçon is shaped like an oval. This oval becomes more circular as 
, and when
the curve is just the circle 
.
The remaining parts of Figure 19 show that as becomes negative, the shapes change 
in reverse order. In fact, these curves are reﬂections about the horizontal axis of the corre-
sponding curves with positive .

AREAS AND LENGTHS IN POLAR COORDINATES
In this section we develop the formula for the area of a region whose boundary is given by
a polar equation. We need to use the formula for the area of a sector of a circle
where, as in Figure 1,
is the radius and 
is the radian measure of the central angle.
Formula 1 follows from the fact that the area of a sector is proportional to its central angle:
. (See also Exercise 35 in Section 7.3.)
Let 
be the region, illustrated in Figure 2, bounded by the polar curve 
and by the rays 
and 
, where 
is a positive continuous function and where
. We divide the interval 
into subintervals with endpoints 
,
,
, . . . ,
and equal width 
. The rays 
then divide 
into smaller regions with
central angle 
. If we choose 
in the 
subinterval 
, then the area
of the th region is approximated by the area of the sector of a circle with central angle
and radius 
. (See Figure 3.)
Thus from Formula 1 we have
and so an approximation to the total area 
of 
is
It appears from Figure 3 that the approximation in (2) improves as 
. But the sums
in (2) are Riemann sums for the function 
, so
It therefore appears plausible (and can in fact be proved) that the formula for the area 
of
the polar region 
is
Formula 3 is often written as
with the understanding that 
. Note the similarity between Formulas 1 and 4.
When we apply Formula 3 or 4, it is helpful to think of the area as being swept out by
a rotating ray through 
that starts with angle and ends with angle .
EXAMPLE 1 Find the area enclosed by one loop of the four-leaved rose 
.
SOLUTION The curve 
was sketched in Example 8 in Section 10.3. Notice from
Figure 4 that the region enclosed by the right loop is swept out by a ray that rotates from

EXAMPLE 2 Find the area of the region that lies inside the circle 
and
outside the cardioid 
.
SOLUTION The cardioid (see Example 7 in Section 10.3) and the circle are sketched in
Figure 5 and the desired region is shaded. The values of and in Formula 4 are deter-
mined by ﬁnding the points of intersection of the two curves. They intersect when
, which gives 
, so 
,
. The desired area can be
found by subtracting the area inside the cardioid between 
and 
from
the area inside the circle from 
to 
. Thus
Since the region is symmetric about the vertical axis 
, we can write
[because 
]
M
Example 2 illustrates the procedure for ﬁnding the area of the region bounded by two
polar curves. In general, let 
be a region, as illustrated in Figure 6, that is bounded by
curves with polar equations 
,
,
, and 
, where 
and 
. The area 
of 
is found by subtracting the area inside 
from the area inside 
, so using Formula 3 we have
| CAUTION The fact that a single point has many representations in polar coordinates
sometimes makes it difﬁcult to ﬁnd all the points of intersection of two polar curves. 
For instance, it is obvious from Figure 5 that the circle and the cardioid have three 
points of intersection; however, in Example 2 we solved the equations 
and
and found only two such points,
and 
. The origin is also
a point of intersection, but we can’t ﬁnd it by solving the equations of the curves because
the origin has no single representation in polar coordinates that satisﬁes both equations.
Notice that, when represented as 
or 
, the origin satisﬁes 
and so it
lies on the circle; when represented as 
, it satisﬁes 
and so it lies on
the cardioid. Think of two points moving along the curves as the parameter value 
increases from 0 to 
. On one curve the origin is reached at 
and 
; on the

other curve it is reached at 
. The points don’t collide at the origin because they
reach the origin at different times, but the curves intersect there nonetheless.
Thus, to ﬁnd all points of intersection of two polar curves, it is recommended that you
draw the graphs of both curves. It is especially convenient to use a graphing calculator or
computer to help with this task.
EXAMPLE 3 Find all points of intersection of the curves

SOLUTION If we solve the equations

intersection:

However, you can see from Figure 7 that the curves have four other points of inter-
section—namely,
,
,
, and 
. These can be found using
symmetry or by noticing that another equation of the circle is 
and then solving
the equations

ARC LENGTH
To ﬁnd the length of a polar curve 
,
, we regard 
as a parameter and
write the parametric equations of the curve as
Using the Product Rule and differentiating with respect to , we obtain
so, using 
, we have
Assuming that 
is continuous, we can use Theorem 10.2.6 to write the arc length as
Therefore the length of a curve with polar equation 
,
, is

CONIC SECTIONS
In this section we give geometric deﬁnitions of parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas and
derive their standard equations. They are called conic sections, or conics, because they
result from intersecting a cone with a plane as shown in Figure 1.

CHAPTER 10 PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS AND POLAR COORDINATES

PARABOLAS
A parabola is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a ﬁxed point 
(called
the focus) and a ﬁxed line (called the directrix). This deﬁnition is illustrated by Figure 2.
Notice that the point halfway between the focus and the directrix lies on the parabola; it is
called the vertex. The line through the focus perpendicular to the directrix is called the
axis of the parabola.
In the 16th century Galileo showed that the path of a projectile that is shot into the 
air at an angle to the ground is a parabola. Since then, parabolic shapes have been used 
in designing automobile headlights, reﬂecting telescopes, and suspension bridges.
(See Problem 18 on page 268 for the reﬂection property of parabolas that makes them so
useful.)
We obtain a particularly simple equation for a parabola if we place its vertex at the ori-
gin 
and its directrix parallel to the -axis as in Figure 3. If the focus is the point 
,
then the directrix has the equation 
. If 
is any point on the parabola, then the
distance from 
to the focus is
and the distance from 
to the directrix is 
. (Figure 3 illustrates the case where
.) The deﬁning property of a parabola is that these distances are equal:
We get an equivalent equation by squaring and simplifying:
An equation of the parabola with focus 
and directrix 
is
If we write 
, then the standard equation of a parabola (1) becomes 
.
It opens upward if 
and downward if 
[see Figure 4, parts (a) and (b)]. The
graph is symmetric with respect to the -axis because (1) is unchanged when is replaced
by 
.

If we interchange and in (1), we obtain
which is an equation of the parabola with focus 
and directrix 
. (Inter-
changing and amounts to reﬂecting about the diagonal line 
.) The parabola opens
to the right if 
and to the left if 
[see Figure 4, parts (c) and (d)]. In both cases
the graph is symmetric with respect to the -axis, which is the axis of the parabola.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the focus and directrix of the parabola 
and sketch 
the graph.
SOLUTION If we write the equation as 
and compare it with Equation 2, we see
that 
, so 
. Thus the focus is 
and the directrix is 
.
The sketch is shown in Figure 5.
M
ELLIPSES
An ellipse is the set of points in a plane the sum of whose distances from two ﬁxed points
and 
is a constant (see Figure 6). These two ﬁxed points are called the foci (plural of
focus). One of Kepler’s laws is that the orbits of the planets in the solar system are ellipses
with the sun at one focus.
In order to obtain the simplest equation for an ellipse, we place the foci on the -axis at
the points 
and 
as in Figure 7 so that the origin is halfway between the foci.
Let the sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to the foci be 
. Then 
is a point on the ellipse when
that is,
or
Squaring both sides, we have

Since 
, it follows that 
. The -intercepts are found by setting
. Then 
, or 
, so 
. The corresponding points 
and
are called the vertices of the ellipse and the line segment joining the vertices 
is called the major axis. To ﬁnd the -intercepts we set 
and obtain

. Equation 3 is unchanged if 
is replaced by 
or 
is replaced by

ellipse is symmetric about both axes. Notice that if the foci coincide, then 
, so 
and the ellipse becomes a circle with radius 
.
We summarize this discussion as follows (see also Figure 8).
The ellipse

If the foci of an ellipse are located on the -axis at

tion by interchanging and in (4). (See Figure 9.)

Like parabolas, ellipses have an interesting reﬂection property that has practical conse-
quences. If a source of light or sound is placed at one focus of a surface with elliptical
cross-sections, then all the light or sound is reﬂected off the surface to the other focus (see
Exercise 63). This principle is used in lithotripsy, a treatment for kidney stones. A reﬂec-
tor with elliptical cross-section is placed in such a way that the kidney stone is at one focus.
High-intensity sound waves generated at the other focus are reﬂected to the stone and
destroy it without damaging surrounding tissue. The patient is spared the trauma of sur-
gery and recovers within a few days.
HYPERBOLAS
A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two
ﬁxed points 
and 
(the foci) is a constant. This deﬁnition is illustrated in Figure 11.
Hyperbolas occur frequently as graphs of equations in chemistry, physics, biology, and
economics (Boyle’s Law, Ohm’s Law, supply and demand curves). A particularly signiﬁ-
cant application of hyperbolas is found in the navigation systems developed in World Wars
I and II (see Exercise 51).
Notice that the deﬁnition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse; the only change
is that the sum of distances has become a difference of distances. In fact, the derivation of
the equation of a hyperbola is also similar to the one given earlier for an ellipse. It is left
as Exercise 52 to show that when the foci are on the -axis at 
and the difference of
distances is 
, then the equation of the hyperbola is
where 
. Notice that the -intercepts are again 
and the points 
and
are the vertices of the hyperbola. But if we put 
in Equation 6 we get
, which is impossible, so there is no -intercept. The hyperbola is symmetric
with respect to both axes.
To analyze the hyperbola further, we look at Equation 6 and obtain
This shows that 
, so 
. Therefore we have 
or 
. This
means that the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches.
When we draw a hyperbola it is useful to ﬁrst draw its asymptotes, which are the dashed
lines 
and 
shown in Figure 12. Both branches of the hyperbola
approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes. [See
Exercise 69 in Section 4.5, where these lines are shown to be slant asymptotes.]
The hyperbola
has foci 
, where 
, vertices 
, and asymptotes

CONIC SECTIONS IN POLAR COORDINATES
In the preceding section we deﬁned the parabola in terms of a focus and directrix, but we
deﬁned the ellipse and hyperbola in terms of two foci. In this section we give a more uni-
ﬁed treatment of all three types of conic sections in terms of a focus and directrix. Further-
more, if we place the focus at the origin, then a conic section has a simple polar equation,
which provides a convenient description of the motion of planets, satellites, and comets.
THEOREM Let 
be a ﬁxed point (called the focus) and be a ﬁxed line
(called the directrix) in a plane. Let be a ﬁxed positive number (called the
eccentricity). The set of all points 
in the plane such that

to the distance from is the constant )

PROOF
Notice that if the eccentricity is 
, then 
and so the given condi-
tion simply becomes the deﬁnition of a parabola as given in Section 10.5.
Let us place the focus 
at the origin and the directrix parallel to the -axis and
units to the right. Thus the directrix has equation 
and is perpendicular to the
polar axis. If the point 
has polar coordinates 
, we see from Figure 1 that
Thus the condition 
, or 
, becomes
If we square both sides of this polar equation and convert to rectangular coordinates,
we get
or
After completing the square, we have
If 
, we recognize Equation 3 as the equation of an ellipse. In fact, it is of the form
where
In Section 10.5 we found that the foci of an ellipse are at a distance from the center,
where
This shows that
and conﬁrms that the focus as deﬁned in Theorem 1 means the same as the focus deﬁned
in Section 10.5. It also follows from Equations 4 and 5 that the eccentricity is given by
If 
, then 
and we see that Equation 3 represents a hyperbola. Just as we
did before, we could rewrite Equation 3 in the form
and see that

By solving Equation 2 for , we see that the polar equation of the conic shown in Fig-
ure 1 can be written as
If the directrix is chosen to be to the left of the focus as 
, or if the directrix is cho-
sen to be parallel to the polar axis as

by the following theorem, which is illustrated by Figure 2. (See Exercises 21–23.)

When rotating conic sections, we ﬁnd it much more convenient to use polar equations
than Cartesian equations. We just use the fact (see Exercise 77 in Section 10.3) that the
graph of 
is the graph of 
rotated counterclockwise about the origin
through an angle .
EXAMPLE 4 If the ellipse of Example 2 is rotated through an angle 
about the
origin, ﬁnd a polar equation and graph the resulting ellipse.
SOLUTION We get the equation of the rotated ellipse by replacing 
with

equation given in Example 2. So the new equation is

of varying the eccentricity . Notice that when is close to 0 the ellipse is nearly circular,

KEPLER’S LAWS
In 1609 the German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler, on the basis of huge
amounts of astronomical data, published the following three laws of planetary motion.
KEPLER’S LAWS
1. A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus.
2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of
the length of the major axis of its orbit.
Although Kepler formulated his laws in terms of the motion of planets around the sun,
they apply equally well to the motion of moons, comets, satellites, and other bodies that
orbit subject to a single gravitational force. In Section 13.4 we will show how to deduce
Kepler’s Laws from Newton’s Laws. Here we use Kepler’s First Law, together with the
polar equation of an ellipse, to calculate quantities of interest in astronomy.
For purposes of astronomical calculations, it’s useful to express the equation of an
ellipse in terms of its eccentricity and its semimajor axis . We can write the distance 
from the focus to the directrix in terms of if we use (4):
So 
. If the directrix is 
, then the polar equation is

The polar equation of an ellipse with focus at the origin, semimajor axis ,
eccentricity , and directrix 
can be written in the form
The positions of a planet that are closest to and farthest from the sun are called its peri-
helion and aphelion, respectively, and correspond to the vertices of the ellipse. (See 
Figure 7.) The distances from the sun to the perihelion and aphelion are called the peri-
helion distance and aphelion distance, respectively. In Figure 1 the sun is at the focus ,
so at perihelion we have 
and, from Equation 7,
Similarly, at aphelion 
and 
.
The perihelion distance from a planet to the sun is 
and the aphelion
distance is 
.

INFINITE SEQUENCES
AND SERIES
11
Inﬁnite sequences and series were introduced brieﬂy in A Preview of Calculus in
connection with Zeno’s paradoxes and the decimal representation of numbers. Their
importance in calculus stems from Newton’s idea of representing functions as sums 
of inﬁnite series. For instance, in ﬁnding areas he often integrated a function by ﬁrst
expressing it as a series and then integrating each term of the series. We will pursue his
idea in Section 11.10 in order to integrate such functions as 
. (Recall that we have
previously been unable to do this.) Many of the functions that arise in mathematical
physics and chemistry, such as Bessel functions, are deﬁned as sums of series, so it is
important to be familiar with the basic concepts of convergence of inﬁnite sequences
and series.
Physicists also use series in another way, as we will see in Section 11.11. In studying
ﬁelds as diverse as optics, special relativity, and electromagnetism, they analyze phe-
nomena by replacing a function with the ﬁrst few terms in the series that represents it.

SEQUENCES
A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a deﬁnite order:
The number 
is called the ﬁrst term,
is the second term, and in general 
is the nth
term. We will deal exclusively with inﬁnite sequences and so each term 
will have a 
successor 
.
Notice that for every positive integer 
there is a corresponding number 
and so a
sequence can be deﬁned as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. But we
usually write 
instead of the function notation 
for the value of the function at the
number .
The sequence {
,
,
, . . .} is also denoted by
EXAMPLE 1 Some sequences can be deﬁned by giving a formula for the nth term. In the
following examples we give three descriptions of the sequence: one by using the preced-
ing notation, another by using the deﬁning formula, and a third by writing out the terms
of the sequence. Notice that doesn’t have to start at 1.

EXAMPLE 2 Find a formula for the general term 
of the sequence
assuming that the pattern of the ﬁrst few terms continues.
SOLUTION We are given that
Notice that the numerators of these fractions start with 3 and increase by 1 whenever we
go to the next term. The second term has numerator 4, the third term has numerator 5; in
general, the th term will have numerator 
. The denominators are the powers of 5,
so 
has denominator 
. The signs of the terms are alternately positive and negative, so

This sequence arose when the 13th-century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci
solved a problem concerning the breeding of rabbits (see Exercise 71).
M
A sequence such as the one in Example 1(a),
, can be pictured either by
plotting its terms on a number line as in Figure 1 or by plotting its graph as in Figure 2.
Note that, since a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers, its
graph consists of isolated points with coordinates
. . .
. . .
From Figure 1 or 2 it appears that the terms of the sequence 
are
approaching 1 as becomes large. In fact, the difference
can be made as small as we like by taking sufﬁciently large. We indicate this by writing
In general, the notation
means that the terms of the sequence 
approach 
as 
becomes large. Notice that the
following deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence is very similar to the deﬁnition of a limit of
a function at inﬁnity given in Section 2.6.

DEFINITION A sequence 
has the limit
and we write
if we can make the terms 
as close to 
as we like by taking sufﬁciently large.
If 
exists, we say the sequence converges (or is convergent). Otherwise,
we say the sequence diverges (or is divergent).
Figure 3 illustrates Deﬁnition 1 by showing the graphs of two sequences that have the
limit .
A more precise version of Deﬁnition 1 is as follows.
DEFINITION A sequence 
has the limit
and we write
if for every 
there is a corresponding integer 
such that
if
then
Deﬁnition 2 is illustrated by Figure 4, in which the terms 
,
,
, . . . are plotted on
a number line. No matter how small an interval 
is chosen, there exists an
such that all terms of the sequence from 
onward must lie in that interval.
Another illustration of Deﬁnition 2 is given in Figure 5. The points on the graph of 
must lie between the horizontal lines 
and 
if 
. This picture
must be valid no matter how small
is chosen, but usually a smaller 
requires a larger

N Compare this deﬁnition with Deﬁnition 2.6.7.

If you compare Deﬁnition 2 with Deﬁnition 2.6.7, you will see that the only difference
between 
and 
is that 
is required to be an integer. Thus
we have the following theorem, which is illustrated by Figure 6.
THEOREM If

In particular, since we know that

If 
becomes large as n becomes large, we use the notation

lowing precise deﬁnition is similar to Deﬁnition 2.6.9.

N CREATING GRAPHS OF SEQUENCES
Some computer algebra systems have special
commands that enable us to create sequences
and graph them directly. With most graphing
calculators, however, sequences can be graphed
by using parametric equations. For instance, the
sequence in Example 9 can be graphed by enter-
ing the parametric equations
and graphing in dot mode, starting with 
and setting the -step equal to . The result is
shown in Figure 10.

DEFINITION A sequence 
is bounded above if there is a number 
such
that
It is bounded below if there is a number 
such that
If it is bounded above and below, then 
is a bounded sequence.
For instance, the sequence 
is bounded below 
but not above. The
sequence 
is bounded because 
for all .
We know that not every bounded sequence is convergent [for instance, the sequence
satisﬁes 
but is divergent from Example 6] and not every mono-
tonic sequence is convergent 
. But if a sequence is both bounded and
monotonic, then it must be convergent. This fact is proved as Theorem 12, but intuitively
you can understand why it is true by looking at Figure 12. If 
is increasing and 
for all , then the terms are forced to crowd together and approach some number .
The proof of Theorem 12 is based on the Completeness Axiom for the set 
of real
numbers, which says that if 
is a nonempty set of real numbers that has an upper bound
(
for all in ), then has a least upper bound . (This means that is an upper
bound for , but if 
is any other upper bound, then 
.) The Completeness Axiom is
an expression of the fact that there is no gap or hole in the real number line.

MONOTONIC SEQUENCE THEOREM Every bounded, monotonic sequence is 
convergent.
PROOF
Suppose 
is an increasing sequence. Since 
is bounded, the set
has an upper bound. By the Completeness Axiom it has a least upper
bound . Given 
,
is not an upper bound for 
(since 
is the least upper
bound). Therefore
But the sequence is increasing so 
for every 
. Thus if 
, we have
so
since 
. Thus
so 
.
A similar proof (using the greatest lower bound) works if 
is decreasing.
M
The proof of Theorem 12 shows that a sequence that is increasing and bounded above
is convergent. (Likewise, a decreasing sequence that is bounded below is convergent.) This
fact is used many times in dealing with inﬁnite series.
EXAMPLE 13 Investigate the sequence 
deﬁned by the recurrence relation
SOLUTION We begin by computing the ﬁrst several terms:
These initial terms suggest that the sequence is increasing and the terms are approaching

that 
for all 
. This is true for

N Mathematical induction is often used in 
dealing with recursive sequences. See page 77
for a discussion of the Principle of Mathematical
Induction.

We have deduced that 
is true for 
. Therefore the inequality is true
for all 
by induction.
Next we verify that 
is bounded by showing that 
for all . (Since the
sequence is increasing, we already know that it has a lower bound: 
for 
all .) We know that 
, so the assertion is true for 
. Suppose it is true for

so
Thus
This shows, by mathematical induction, that

Since the sequence 
is increasing and bounded, Theorem 12 guarantees that it has
a limit. The theorem doesn’t tell us what the value of the limit is. But now that we know
exists, we can use the recurrence relation to write
Since

A sequence that arises in ecology as a model for population growth is deﬁned by the logistic 
difference equation
where
measures the size of the population of the 
generation of a single species. To keep the
numbers manageable,
is a fraction of the maximal size of the population, so 
. Notice
that the form of this equation is similar to the logistic differential equation in Section 9.4. The
discrete model—with sequences instead of continuous functions—is preferable for modeling insect
populations, where mating and death occur in a periodic fashion.
An ecologist is interested in predicting the size of the population as time goes on, and asks 
these questions: Will it stabilize at a limiting value? Will it change in a cyclical fashion? Or will 
it exhibit random behavior?
Write a program to compute the ﬁrst 
terms of this sequence starting with an initial population
. Use this program to do the following.
1. Calculate 20 or 30 terms of the sequence for 
and for two values of such that
. Graph the sequences. Do they appear to converge? Repeat for a different value of
between 0 and 1. Does the limit depend on the choice of 
? Does it depend on the choice
of ?
2. Calculate terms of the sequence for a value of between 3 and 3.4 and plot them. What do
you notice about the behavior of the terms?
3. Experiment with values of between 3.4 and 3.5. What happens to the terms?
4. For values of between 3.6 and 4, compute and plot at least 100 terms and comment on the
behavior of the sequence. What happens if you change 
by 0.001? This type of behavior is
called chaotic and is exhibited by insect populations under certain conditions.

SERIES
If we try to add the terms of an inﬁnite sequence 
we get an expression of the form
which is called an inﬁnite series (or just a series) and is denoted, for short, by the symbol
But does it make sense to talk about the sum of inﬁnitely many terms?
It would be impossible to ﬁnd a ﬁnite sum for the series
because if we start adding the terms we get the cumulative sums 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . .
and, after the 
term, we get 
, which becomes very large as increases.
However, if we start to add the terms of the series

we get , , , , , , . . . , 
, . . . . The table shows that as we add more and more
terms, these partial sums become closer and closer to 1. (See also Figure 11 in A Preview
of Calculus, page 7.) In fact, by adding sufﬁciently many terms of the series we can make
the partial sums as close as we like to 1. So it seems reasonable to say that the sum of this
inﬁnite series is 1 and to write
We use a similar idea to determine whether or not a general series (1) has a sum. We
consider the partial sums
and, in general,
These partial sums form a new sequence 
, which may or may not have a limit. If
exists (as a ﬁnite number), then, as in the preceding example, we call it the
sum of the inﬁnite series 
.
DEFINITION Given a series 
, let 
denote its
partial sum:
If the sequence 
is convergent and 
exists as a real number, then
the series 
is called convergent and we write
The number is called the sum of the series. Otherwise, the series is called divergent.
Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So when we write
, we mean that by adding sufﬁciently many terms of the series we can get as
close as we like to the number . Notice that

N What do we really mean when we say that
the sum of the series in Example 2 is 3? Of
course, we can’t literally add an inﬁnite number
of terms, one by one. But, according to Deﬁnition
2, the total sum is the limit of the sequence of
partial sums. So, by taking the sum of sufﬁciently
many terms, we can get as close as we like to
the number 3. The table shows the ﬁrst ten par-
tial sums 
and the graph in Figure 2 shows how
the sequence of partial sums approaches 3.

We can simplify this expression if we use the partial fraction decomposition
(see Section 7.4). Thus we have

an example of a telescoping sum: Because of
all the cancellations, the sum collapses (like a
pirate’s collapsing telescope) into just two terms.

This shows that

series diverges.
M
THEOREM If the series 
is convergent, then 
.
PROOF
Let 
. Then 
. Since 
is convergent, the
sequence 
is convergent. Let 
. Since 
as 
, we also
have 
. Therefore
M
With any series
we associate two sequences: the sequence 
of its par-
tial sums and the sequence 
of its terms. If 
is convergent, then the limit of the
sequence 
is 
(the sum of the series) and, as Theorem 6 asserts, the limit of the
sequence 
is 0.
|
The converse of Theorem 6 is not true in general. If 
, we cannot
conclude that 
is convergent. Observe that for the harmonic series 
we have
as 
, but we showed in Example 7 that 
is divergent.
THE TEST FOR DIVERGENCE If 
does not exist or if 
, then the
series 
is divergent.
The Test for Divergence follows from Theorem 6 because, if the series is not divergent,
then it is convergent, and so 
.
EXAMPLE 8 Show that the series 
diverges.
SOLUTION
So the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.
M
If we ﬁnd that

ber the warning in Note 2: If

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
N The method used in Example 7 for showing
that the harmonic series diverges is due to the
French scholar Nicole Oresme (1323–1382).

(where is a constant), 
, and 
, and
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
These properties of convergent series follow from the corresponding Limit Laws for
Sequences in Section 11.1. For instance, here is how part (ii) of Theorem 8 is proved:
Let
The nth partial sum for the series 
is
and, using Equation 5.2.10, we have
Therefore

M
EXAMPLE 9 Find the sum of the series 
.
SOLUTION The series 
is a geometric series with 
and 
, so
In Example 6 we found that
So, by Theorem 8, the given series is convergent and
M
A ﬁnite number of terms doesn’t affect the convergence or divergence of a
series. For instance, suppose that we were able to show that the series

57. When money is spent on goods and services, those who
receive the money also spend some of it. The people receiv-
ing some of the twice-spent money will spend some of that,
and so on. Economists call this chain reaction the multiplier
effect. In a hypothetical isolated community, the local govern-
ment begins the process by spending 
dollars. Suppose that
each recipient of spent money spends 
and saves
of the money that he or she receives. The values and
s are called the marginal propensity to consume and the mar-
ginal propensity to save and, of course,
.
(a) Let 
be the total spending that has been generated after 
transactions. Find an equation for 
.
(b) Show that 
, where 
. The number 
is called the multiplier. What is the multiplier if the 
marginal propensity to consume is 
?
Note: The federal government uses this principle to justify
deﬁcit spending. Banks use this principle to justify lending a
large percentage of the money that they receive in deposits.

The Cantor set, named after the German mathematician
Georg Cantor (1845–1918), is constructed as follows. We
start with the closed interval 
and remove the open inter-
val 
. That leaves the two intervals 
and 
and
we remove the open middle third of each. Four intervals
remain and again we remove the open middle third of each of
them. We continue this procedure indeﬁnitely, at each step
removing the open middle third of every interval that remains
from the preceding step. The Cantor set consists of the num-
bers that remain in 
after all those intervals have been
removed.
(a) Show that the total length of all the intervals that are
removed is 1. Despite that, the Cantor set contains inﬁ-
nitely many numbers. Give examples of some numbers in
the Cantor set.
(b) The Sierpinski carpet is a two-dimensional counterpart
of the Cantor set. It is constructed by removing the center
one-ninth of a square of side 1, then removing the centers
of the eight smaller remaining squares, and so on. (The
ﬁgure shows the ﬁrst three steps of the construction.)
Show that the sum of the areas of the removed squares 
is 1. This implies that the Sierpinski carpet has area 0.

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

THE INTEGRAL TEST AND ESTIMATES OF SUMS
In general, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the exact sum of a series. We were able to accomplish this
for geometric series and the series 
because in each of those cases we could
ﬁnd a simple formula for the 
partial sum 
. But usually it isn’t easy to compute
. Therefore, in the next few sections, we develop several tests that enable us to
determine whether a series is convergent or divergent without explicitly ﬁnding its sum.
(In some cases, however, our methods will enable us to ﬁnd good estimates of the sum.)
Our ﬁrst test involves improper integrals.
We begin by investigating the series whose terms are the reciprocals of the squares of
the positive integers:
There’s no simple formula for the sum 
of the ﬁrst n terms, but the computer-generated
table of values given in the margin suggests that the partial sums are approaching a num-
ber near 1.64 as 
and so it looks as if the series is convergent.
We can conﬁrm this impression with a geometric argument. Figure 1 shows the curve
and rectangles that lie below the curve. The base of each rectangle is an interval
of length 1; the height is equal to the value of the function 
at the right endpoint
of the interval. So the sum of the areas of the rectangles is

If we exclude the ﬁrst rectangle, the total area of the remaining rectangles is smaller
than the area under the curve 
for 
, which is the value of the integral
. In Section 7.8 we discovered that this improper integral is convergent and has
value 1. So the picture shows that all the partial sums are less than
Thus the partial sums are bounded. We also know that the partial sums are increasing
(because all the terms are positive). Therefore the partial sums converge (by the Monotonic
Sequence Theorem) and so the series is convergent. The sum of the series (the limit of the
partial sums) is also less than 2:
[The exact sum of this series was found by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler
(1707–1783) to be 
, but the proof of this fact is quite difﬁcult. (See Problem 6 in the
Problems Plus following Chapter 15.)]
Now let’s look at the series
The table of values of 
suggests that the partial sums aren’t approaching a ﬁnite number,
so we suspect that the given series may be divergent. Again we use a picture for conﬁrma-
tion. Figure 2 shows the curve 
, but this time we use rectangles whose tops lie
above the curve.
The base of each rectangle is an interval of length 1. The height is equal to the value of
the function 
at the left endpoint of the interval. So the sum of the areas of all the
rectangles is
This total area is greater than the area under the curve 
for 
, which is equal
to the integral 
. But we know from Section 7.8 that this improper integral is
divergent. In other words, the area under the curve is inﬁnite. So the sum of the series must
be inﬁnite; that is, the series is divergent.
The same sort of geometric reasoning that we used for these two series can be used to
prove the following test. (The proof is given at the end of this section.)

THE INTEGRAL TEST Suppose 
is a continuous, positive, decreasing function on
and let 
. Then the series 
is convergent if and only if the
improper integral 
is convergent. In other words:
(i) If 
is convergent, then 
is convergent.
(ii) If 
is divergent, then 
is divergent.
When we use the Integral Test, it is not necessary to start the series or the inte-
gral at 
. For instance, in testing the series
Also, it is not necessary that 
be always decreasing. What is important is that

mately decreasing, that is, decreasing for 
larger than some number . Then

convergent, so 
is convergent by Note 4 of Section 11.2.
EXAMPLE 1 Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION The function 
is continuous, positive, and decreasing on
so we use the Integral Test:
Thus 
is a convergent integral and so, by the Integral Test, the series
is convergent.
M
EXAMPLE 2 For what values of 
is the series 
convergent?
SOLUTION If 
, then 
. If 
, then 
. In either
case,
, so the given series diverges by the Test for Divergence (11.2.7).
If 
, then the function 
is clearly continuous, positive, and decreasing
on 
. We found in Chapter 7 [see (7.8.2)] that
It follows from the Integral Test that the series 
converges if 
and diverges if
. (For 
, this series is the harmonic series discussed in Example 7 in
Section 11.2.)
M
The series in Example 2 is called the p-series. It is important in the rest of this chapter,
so we summarize the results of Example 2 for future reference as follows.

have to be able to ﬁnd an antiderivative of .
Frequently this is difﬁcult or impossible, so we
need other tests for convergence too.

We should not infer from the Integral Test that the sum of the series is equal to
the value of the integral. In fact,
Therefore, in general,
EXAMPLE 4 Determine whether the series 
converges or diverges.
SOLUTION The function

because the
logarithm function is continuous. But it is not obvious whether or not

we compute its derivative:
Thus

and so we can apply the Integral Test:
Since this improper integral is divergent, the series 
is also divergent by the
Integral Test.

ESTIMATING THE SUM OF A SERIES
Suppose we have been able to use the Integral Test to show that a series 
is conver-
gent and we now want to ﬁnd an approximation to the sum of the series. Of course, any
partial sum 
is an approximation to because 
. But how good is such an
approximation? To ﬁnd out, we need to estimate the size of the remainder

The remainder 
is the error made when , the sum of the ﬁrst 
terms, is used as an
approximation to the total sum.
We use the same notation and ideas as in the Integral Test, assuming that 
is decreas-
ing on 
. Comparing the areas of the rectangles with the area under 
for

Similarly, we see from Figure 4 that

Solving this inequality, we get
We need 32 terms to ensure accuracy to within

If we add 
to each side of the inequalities in (2), we get
because

for . They provide a more accurate approximation to the sum of the series than the partial
sum 
does.

SOLUTION The inequalities in (3) become
From Example 5 we know that
so
Using 
, we get
If we approximate by the midpoint of this interval, then the error is at most half the
length of the interval. So
M
If we compare Example 6 with Example 5, we see that the improved estimate in (3) can
be much better than the estimate 
. To make the error smaller than 
we had to
use 32 terms in Example 5 but only 10 terms in Example 6.
PROOF OF THE INTEGRAL TEST
We have already seen the basic idea behind the proof of the Integral Test in Figures 1 and
2 for the series 
and 
. For the general series 
, look at Figures 5 and 6. The
area of the ﬁrst shaded rectangle in Figure 5 is the value of

shows that

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

THE COMPARISON TESTS
In the comparison tests the idea is to compare a given series with a series that is known to
be convergent or divergent. For instance, the series
reminds us of the series 
, which is a geometric series with 
and 
and
is therefore convergent. Because the series (1) is so similar to a convergent series, we have
the feeling that it too must be convergent. Indeed, it is. The inequality
shows that our given series (1) has smaller terms than those of the geometric series and
therefore all its partial sums are also smaller than 1 (the sum of the geometric series). This
means that its partial sums form a bounded increasing sequence, which is convergent. It
also follows that the sum of the series is less than the sum of the geometric series:
Similar reasoning can be used to prove the following test, which applies only to series
whose terms are positive. The ﬁrst part says that if we have a series whose terms are 
smaller than those of a known convergent series, then our series is also convergent. The
second part says that if we start with a series whose terms are larger than those of a known
divergent series, then it too is divergent.
THE COMPARISON TEST Suppose that 
and 
are series with positive terms.
(i) If 
is convergent and 
for all , then 
is also convergent.
(ii) If 
is divergent and 
for all , then 
is also divergent.
PROOF
(i) Let
Since both series have positive terms, the sequences 
and 
are increasing
. Also 
, so 
for all . Since 
.
Thus 
for all . This means that 
is increasing and bounded above and therefore
converges by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Thus 
converges.
(ii) If 
is divergent, then 
(since 
is increasing). But 
so 
.
Thus 
. Therefore 
diverges.
M
In using the Comparison Test we must, of course, have some known series 
for
the purpose of comparison. Most of the time we use one of these series:
N A 
-series [
converges if 
and diverges if 
; see (11.3.1)]
N A geometric series [
converges if 
and diverges if 
; 
see (11.2.4)]

N It is important to keep in mind the distinction
between a sequence and a series. A sequence is
a list of numbers, whereas a series is a sum.
With every series 
there are associated two
sequences: the sequence 
of terms and the
sequence 
of partial sums.

Standard Series for Use
with the Comparison Test

EXAMPLE 1 Determine whether the series 
converges or diverges.
SOLUTION For large the dominant term in the denominator is 
so we compare the
given series with the series 
. Observe that
because the left side has a bigger denominator. (In the notation of the Comparison Test,
is the left side and 
is the right side.) We know that
is convergent because it’s a constant times a -series with 
. Therefore
is convergent by part (i) of the Comparison Test.
M
Although the condition 
or 
in the Comparison Test is given for
all , we need verify only that it holds for 
, where 
is some ﬁxed integer, because
the convergence of a series is not affected by a ﬁnite number of terms. This is illustrated
in the next example.
EXAMPLE 2 Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION This series was tested (using the Integral Test) in Example 4 in Section 11.3,
but it is also possible to test it by comparing it with the harmonic series. Observe that
for 
and so
We know that 
is divergent ( -series with 
). Thus the given series is divergent
by the Comparison Test.
M
The terms of the series being tested must be smaller than those of a convergent
series or larger than those of a divergent series. If the terms are larger than the terms of a
convergent series or smaller than those of a divergent series, then the Comparison Test
doesn’t apply. Consider, for instance, the series
The inequality
is useless as far as the Comparison Test is concerned because 
is convergent
and 
. Nonetheless, we have the feeling that 
ought to be convergent
because it is very similar to the convergent geometric series 
. In such cases the fol-
lowing test can be used.

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

THE LIMIT COMPARISON TEST Suppose that 
and 
are series with positive
terms. If
where c is a ﬁnite number and 
, then either both series converge or both
diverge.
PROOF
Let m and M be positive numbers such that 
. Because 
is close
to c for large n, there is an integer N such that
and so
If

diverges.

Since 
is divergent ( -series with

by the Limit Comparison Test.
M
Notice that in testing many series we ﬁnd a suitable comparison series 
by keeping
only the highest powers in the numerator and denominator.
ESTIMATING SUMS
If we have used the Comparison Test to show that a series 
converges by comparison
with a series 
, then we may be able to estimate the sum 
by comparing remainders.
As in Section 11.3, we consider the remainder
For the comparison series 
we consider the corresponding remainder
Since 
for all , we have 
. If 
is a -series, we can estimate its remain-
der 
as in Section 11.3. If 
is a geometric series, then 
is the sum of a geometric
series and we can sum it exactly (see Exercises 35 and 36). In either case we know that 
is smaller than 
.
EXAMPLE 5 Use the sum of the ﬁrst 100 terms to approximate the sum of the series
. Estimate the error involved in this approximation.
SOLUTION Since
the given series is convergent by the Comparison Test. The remainder 
for the compari-
son series 
was estimated in Example 5 in Section 11.3 using the Remainder Esti-
mate for the Integral Test. There we found that
Therefore the remainder 
for the given series satisﬁes
With 
we have
Using a programmable calculator or a computer, we ﬁnd that

ALTERNATING SERIES
The convergence tests that we have looked at so far apply only to series with positive
terms. In this section and the next we learn how to deal with series whose terms are not
necessarily positive. Of particular importance are alternating series, whose terms alternate
in sign.
An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative. Here
are two examples:
We see from these examples that the th term of an alternating series is of the form
where 
is a positive number. (In fact,
.)
The following test says that if the terms of an alternating series decrease toward 0 in
absolute value, then the series converges.
THE ALTERNATING SERIES TEST
If the alternating series
satisﬁes
(i)
(ii)
then the series is convergent.
Before giving the proof let’s look at Figure 1, which gives a picture of the idea behind
the proof. We ﬁrst plot 
on a number line. To ﬁnd 
we subtract 
, so 
is to the
left of . Then to ﬁnd 
we add 
, so 
is to the right of . But, since 
,
is to
the left of 
. Continuing in this manner, we see that the partial sums oscillate back and

, the successive steps are becoming smaller and smaller. The even par-
tial sums ,

Thus it seems plausible that both are converging to some number , which is the sum of
the series. Therefore we consider the even and odd partial sums separately in the follow-
ing proof.

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

PROOF OF THE ALTERNATING SERIES TEST
We ﬁrst consider the even partial sums:
In general
Thus
But we can also write
Every term in brackets is positive, so 
for all . Therefore the sequence 
of even partial sums is increasing and bounded above. It is therefore convergent by the
Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Let’s call its limit , that is,
Now we compute the limit of the odd partial sums:
[by condition (ii)]
Since both the even and odd partial sums converge to , we have 
[see Exercise 80(a) in Section 11.1] and so the series is convergent.

SOLUTION The given series is alternating so we try to verify conditions (i) and (ii) of the

Unlike the situation in Example 1, it is not obvious that the sequence given by

can be veriﬁed directly but
all that really matters is that the sequence 
is eventually decreasing.)
Condition (ii) is readily veriﬁed:
Thus the given series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test.

ESTIMATING SUMS
A partial sum 
of any convergent series can be used as an approximation to the total sum
, but this is not of much use unless we can estimate the accuracy of the approximation. The
error involved in using 
is the remainder 
. The next theorem says that 
for series that satisfy the conditions of the Alternating Series Test, the size of the error is
smaller than 
, which is the absolute value of the ﬁrst neglected term.
ALTERNATING SERIES ESTIMATION THEOREM If

alternating series that satisﬁes
(i)
and
(ii)

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
ABSOLUTE CONVERGENCE AND THE RATIO AND ROOT TESTS
Given any series 
, we can consider the corresponding series
whose terms are the absolute values of the terms of the original series.
DEFINITION A series 
is called absolutely convergent if the series of
absolute values 
is convergent.
Notice that if 
is a series with positive terms, then 
and so absolute con-
vergence is the same as convergence in this case.

N We have convergence tests for series with
positive terms and for alternating series. But
what if the signs of the terms switch back and
forth irregularly? We will see in Example 3 that
the idea of absolute convergence sometimes
helps in such cases.

is absolutely convergent because
is a convergent -series (
).
M
EXAMPLE 2 We know that the alternating harmonic series
is convergent (see Example 1 in Section 11.5), but it is not absolutely convergent
because the corresponding series of absolute values is
which is the harmonic series ( -series with 
) and is therefore divergent.
M
DEFINITION A series 
is called conditionally convergent if it is conver-
gent but not absolutely convergent.
Example 2 shows that the alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent. Thus
it is possible for a series to be convergent but not absolutely convergent. However, the next
theorem shows that absolute convergence implies convergence.
THEOREM If a series 
is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent.
PROOF
Observe that the inequality
is true because 
is either 
or 
. If 
is absolutely convergent, then 
is
convergent, so 
is convergent. Therefore, by the Comparison Test,
is convergent. Then
is the difference of two convergent series and is therefore convergent.
M
EXAMPLE 3 Determine whether the series
is convergent or divergent.
SOLUTION This series has both positive and negative terms, but it is not alternating. 
(The ﬁrst term is positive, the next three are negative, and the following three are posi-
tive: The signs change irregularly.) We can apply the Comparison Test to the series of
absolute values

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Now the series
is convergent because it is a geometric series with 
. So the inequality (5),
together with the Comparison Test, shows that the series
is also convergent. It follows that the series 
is convergent. (Recall that a ﬁnite
number of terms doesn’t affect convergence.) Therefore 
is absolutely convergent.
(ii) If 
or 
, then the ratio 
will eventually be
greater than 1; that is, there exists an integer

diverges by the Test for Divergence.
M
Part (iii) of the Ratio Test says that if 
, the test gives no
information. For instance, for the convergent series 
we have
whereas for the divergent series 
we have
Therefore, if 
, the series 
might converge or it might diverge. In
this case the Ratio Test fails and we must use some other test.

N ESTIMATING SUMS
In the last three sections we used various meth-
ods for estimating the sum of a series—the
method depended on which test was used to
prove convergence. What about series for which
the Ratio Test works? There are two possibilities:
If the series happens to be an alternating series,
as in Example 4, then it is best to use the meth-
ods of Section 11.5. If the terms are all positive,
then use the special methods explained in 
Exercise 34.

Thus, by the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent and therefore 
convergent.
M
EXAMPLE 5 Test the convergence of the series 
.
SOLUTION Since the terms 
are positive, we don’t need the absolute value signs.
(See Equation 3.6.6.) Since 
, the given series is divergent by the Ratio Test.
M
Although the Ratio Test works in Example 5, an easier method is to use the Test
for Divergence. Since
it follows that 
does not approach 0 as 
. Therefore the given series is divergent 
by the Test for Divergence.
The following test is convenient to apply when th powers occur. Its proof is similar to
the proof of the Ratio Test and is left as Exercise 37.
THE ROOT TEST
(i) If 
, then the series 
is absolutely convergent 
(and therefore convergent).
(ii) If 
or 
, then the series 
is divergent.
(iii) If 
, the Root Test is inconclusive.
If 
, then part (iii) of the Root Test says that the test gives no infor-
mation. The series 
could converge or diverge. (If 
in the Ratio Test, don’t try the
Root Test because will again be 1. And if 
in the Root Test, don’t try the Ratio Test
because it will fail too.)
EXAMPLE 6 Test the convergence of the series 
.
SOLUTION
Thus the given series converges by the Root Test.

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

REARRANGEMENTS
The question of whether a given convergent series is absolutely convergent or condi-
tionally convergent has a bearing on the question of whether inﬁnite sums behave like
ﬁnite sums.
If we rearrange the order of the terms in a ﬁnite sum, then of course the value of the
sum remains unchanged. But this is not always the case for an inﬁnite series. By a
rearrangement of an inﬁnite series 
we mean a series obtained by simply changing
the order of the terms. For instance, a rearrangement of 
could start as follows:
It turns out that
if 
is an absolutely convergent series with sum s,
then any rearrangement of 
has the same sum s.
However, any conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to give a different sum. To
illustrate this fact let’s consider the alternating harmonic series
(See Exercise 36 in Section 11.5.) If we multiply this series by , we get
Inserting zeros between the terms of this series, we have
Now we add the series in Equations 6 and 7 using Theorem 11.2.8:
Notice that the series in (8) contains the same terms as in (6), but rearranged so that one
negative term occurs after each pair of positive terms. The sums of these series, however,
are different. In fact, Riemann proved that
if 
is a conditionally convergent series and r is any real number what-
soever, then there is a rearrangement of 
that has a sum equal to r.
A proof of this fact is outlined in Exercise 40.

SECTION 11.7 STRATEGY FOR TESTING SERIES
||||
721
STRATEGY FOR TESTING SERIES
We now have several ways of testing a series for convergence or divergence; the problem
is to decide which test to use on which series. In this respect, testing series is similar to
integrating functions. Again there are no hard and fast rules about which test to apply to a
given series, but you may ﬁnd the following advice of some use.
It is not wise to apply a list of the tests in a speciﬁc order until one ﬁnally works. That
would be a waste of time and effort. Instead, as with integration, the main strategy is to
classify the series according to its form.
1. If the series is of the form 
, it is a -series, which we know to be convergent
if 
and divergent if 
.
2. If the series has the form 
or 
, it is a geometric series, which converges
if 
and diverges if 
. Some preliminary algebraic manipulation may
be required to bring the series into this form.
3. If the series has a form that is similar to a -series or a geometric series, then 
one of the comparison tests should be considered. In particular, if 
is a rational 
function or an algebraic function of (involving roots of polynomials), then the
series should be compared with a -series. Notice that most of the series in Exer-
cises 11.4 have this form. (The value of 
should be chosen as in Section 11.4 by
keeping only the highest powers of in the numerator and denominator.) The com-
parison tests apply only to series with positive terms, but if 
has some negative
terms, then we can apply the Comparison Test to 
and test for absolute 
convergence.
4. If you can see at a glance that 
, then the Test for Divergence should
be used.
5. If the series is of the form 
or 
, then the Alternating Series
Test is an obvious possibility.
6. Series that involve factorials or other products (including a constant raised to the
power) are often conveniently tested using the Ratio Test. Bear in mind that
as 
for all -series and therefore all rational or algebraic 
functions of . Thus the Ratio Test should not be used for such series.
7. If 
is of the form 
, then the Root Test may be useful.
8. If 
, where 
is easily evaluated, then the Integral Test is effective
(assuming the hypotheses of this test are satisﬁed).
In the following examples we don’t work out all the details but simply indicate which
tests should be used.

Since 
as 
, we should use the Test for Divergence.

POWER SERIES
A power series is a series of the form
where is a variable and the ’s are constants called the coefﬁcients of the series. For each
ﬁxed , the series (1) is a series of constants that we can test for convergence or divergence.
A power series may converge for some values of and diverge for other values of . The
sum of the series is a function
whose domain is the set of all for which the series converges. Notice that 
resembles a
polynomial. The only difference is that 
has inﬁnitely many terms.
For instance, if we take 
for all , the power series becomes the geometric series
which converges when 
and diverges when 
(see Equation 11.2.5).
More generally, a series of the form
is called a power series in 
or a power series centered at a or a power series
about a. Notice that in writing out the term corresponding to 
in Equations 1 and 2
we have adopted the convention that 
even when 
. Notice also that when
, all of the terms are 0 for 
and so the power series (2) always converges when
.
EXAMPLE 1 For what values of is the series 
convergent?
SOLUTION We use the Ratio Test. If we let 
, as usual, denote the nth term of the series,
then 
. If 
, we have
By the Ratio Test, the series diverges when 
. Thus the given series converges only
when

N TRIGONOMETRIC SERIES
A power series is a series in which each term is
a power function. A trigonometric series
is a series whose terms are trigonometric func-
tions. This type of series is discussed on the

By the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent, and therefore convergent,
when 
and divergent when 
. Now
so the series converges when 
and diverges when 
or 
.
The Ratio Test gives no information when 
so we must consider 
and 
separately. If we put 
in the series, it becomes 
, the harmonic
series, which is divergent. If 
, the series is 
, which converges by the
Alternating Series Test. Thus the given power series converges for 
.
M
We will see that the main use of a power series is that it provides a way to represent
some of the most important functions that arise in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In
particular, the sum of the power series in the next example is called a Bessel function, after
the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846), and the function given in Exer-
cise 35 is another example of a Bessel function. In fact, these functions ﬁrst arose when
Bessel solved Kepler’s equation for describing planetary motion. Since that time, these
functions have been applied in many different physical situations, including the tempera-
ture distribution in a circular plate and the shape of a vibrating drumhead.
EXAMPLE 3 Find the domain of the Bessel function of order 0 deﬁned by

. Then
Thus, by the Ratio Test, the given series converges for all values of . In other words, the
domain of the Bessel function 
is

Recall that the sum of a series is equal to the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So
when we deﬁne the Bessel function in Example 3 as the sum of a series we mean that, for

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
N Notice how closely the computer-generated
model (which involves Bessel functions and
cosine functions) matches the photograph of a
vibrating rubber membrane.

Figure 1 shows the graphs of these partial sums, which are polynomials. They are all
approximations to the function 
, but notice that the approximations become better when
more terms are included. Figure 2 shows a more complete graph of the Bessel function.
For the power series that we have looked at so far, the set of values of for which the
series is convergent has always turned out to be an interval [a ﬁnite interval for the 
geometric series and the series in Example 2, the inﬁnite interval 
in Example 3,
and a collapsed interval 
in Example 1]. The following theorem, proved in
Appendix F, says that this is true in general.
THEOREM For a given power series 
, there are only three 
possibilities:
(i) The series converges only when 
.
(ii) The series converges for all .
(iii) There is a positive number 
such that the series converges if 
and diverges if 
.
The number 
in case (iii) is called the radius of convergence of the power series. By
convention, the radius of convergence is 
in case (i) and 
in case (ii). The
interval of convergence of a power series is the interval that consists of all values of for
which the series converges. In case (i) the interval consists of just a single point . In case
(ii) the interval is 
. In case (iii) note that the inequality 
can be rewrit-
ten as 
. When 
is an endpoint of the interval, that is,
,
anything can happen—the series might converge at one or both endpoints or it might
diverge at both endpoints. Thus in case (iii) there are four possibilities for the interval of
convergence:
The situation is illustrated in Figure 3.
We summarize here the radius and interval of convergence for each of the examples
already considered in this section.

In general, the Ratio Test (or sometimes the Root Test) should be used to determine the
radius of convergence . The Ratio and Root Tests always fail when 
is an endpoint of
the interval of convergence, so the endpoints must be checked with some other test.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the series
SOLUTION Let 
. Then
By the Ratio Test, the given series converges if 
and diverges if 
.
Thus it converges if 
and diverges if 
. This means that the radius of con-
vergence is 
.
We know the series converges in the interval 
, but we must now test for con-
vergence at the endpoints of this interval. If 
, the series becomes
which diverges. (Use the Integral Test or simply observe that it is a -series with
.) If 
, the series is 
which converges by the Alternating Series Test. Therefore the given power series con-
verges when 
, so the interval of convergence is 
.
M
EXAMPLE 5 Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the series
SOLUTION If 
, then
Using the Ratio Test, we see that the series converges if 
and it diverges if
. So it converges if 
and diverges if 
. Thus the
radius of convergence is 
.

doesn’t converge to 0]. When

the series is
which also diverges by the Test for Divergence. Thus the series converges only when

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
REPRESENTATIONS OF FUNCTIONS AS POWER SERIES
In this section we learn how to represent certain types of functions as sums of power series
by manipulating geometric series or by differentiating or integrating such a series. You might
wonder why we would ever want to express a known function as a sum of inﬁnitely many
terms. We will see later that this strategy is useful for integrating functions that don’t have
elementary antiderivatives, for solving differential equations, and for approximating func-
tions by polynomials. (Scientists do this to simplify the expressions they deal with; com-
puter scientists do this to represent functions on calculators and computers.)
We start with an equation that we have seen before:
We ﬁrst encountered this equation in Example 5 in Section 11.2, where we obtained it by
observing that it is a geometric series with 
and 
. But here our point of view is
different. We now regard Equation 1 as expressing the function 
as a sum
of a power series.

EXAMPLE 1 Express 
as the sum of a power series and ﬁnd the interval of 
convergence.
SOLUTION Replacing by 
in Equation 1, we have
Because this is a geometric series, it converges when 
, that is,
, or
. Therefore the interval of convergence is 
. (Of course, we could have
determined the radius of convergence by applying the Ratio Test, but that much work is
unnecessary here.)

EXAMPLE 2 Find a power series representation for

SOLUTION In order to put this function in the form of the left side of Equation 1 we ﬁrst
factor a 2 from the denominator:
This series converges when 
, that is,
. So the interval of convergence
is 
.
M
EXAMPLE 3 Find a power series representation of 
.
SOLUTION Since this function is just 
times the function in Example 2, all we have to do
is to multiply that series by 
:
Another way of writing this series is as follows:
As in Example 2, the interval of convergence is 
.
M
DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION OF POWER SERIES
The sum of a power series is a function 
whose domain is the inter-
val of convergence of the series. We would like to be able to differentiate and integrate
such functions, and the following theorem (which we won’t prove) says that we can do so
by differentiating or integrating each individual term in the series, just as we would for a
polynomial. This is called term-by-term differentiation and integration.

THEOREM If the power series 
has radius of convergence 
,
then the function 
deﬁned by
is differentiable (and therefore continuous) on the interval 
and
(i)
(ii)
The radii of convergence of the power series in Equations (i) and (ii) are both .
Equations (i) and (ii) in Theorem 2 can be rewritten in the form
(iii)
(iv)
We know that, for ﬁnite sums, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives and the
integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. Equations (iii) and (iv) assert that the same is
true for inﬁnite sums, provided we are dealing with power series. (For other types of series
of functions the situation is not as simple; see Exercise 36.)
Although Theorem 2 says that the radius of convergence remains the same
when a power series is differentiated or integrated, this does not mean that the interval of
convergence remains the same. It may happen that the original series converges at an end-
point, whereas the differentiated series diverges there. (See Exercise 37.)
The idea of differentiating a power series term by term is the basis for a power-
ful method for solving differential equations. We will discuss this method in Chapter 17.
EXAMPLE 4 In Example 3 in Section 11.8 we saw that the Bessel function
is deﬁned for all . Thus, by Theorem 2,
is differentiable for all and its derivative is
found by term-by-term differentiation as follows:

According to Theorem 2, the radius of convergence of the differentiated series is the

Since the radius of convergence of the series for

gence of this series for 
is also 1.

EXAMPLE 8
(a) Evaluate 
as a power series.
(b) Use part (a) to approximate 
correct to within 
.
SOLUTION
(a) The ﬁrst step is to express the integrand,
, as the sum of a power series.
As in Example 1, we start with Equation 1 and replace by 
:
Now we integrate term by term:
This series converges for 
, that is, for 
.
(b) In applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, it doesn’t matter which anti-
derivative we use, so let’s use the antiderivative from part (a) with C  0:
This inﬁnite series is the exact value of the deﬁnite integral, but since it is an alternating
series, we can approximate the sum using the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. 
If we stop adding after the term with 
, the error is smaller than the term with 
n  4:

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
N The power series for 
obtained in Exam-
ple 7 is called Gregory’s series after the Scottish
mathematician James Gregory (1638–1675), who
had anticipated some of Newton’s discoveries.
We have shown that Gregory’s series is valid
when 
, but it turns out (although it
isn’t easy to prove) that it is also valid when
. Notice that when 
the series

N This example demonstrates one way in 
which power series representations are useful.
Integrating 
by hand is incredibly dif-
ﬁcult. Different computer algebra systems return
different forms of the answer, but they are all
extremely complicated. (If you have a CAS, try 
it yourself.) The inﬁnite series answer that we
obtain in Example 8(a) is actually much easier to
deal with than the ﬁnite answer provided by a
CAS.

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
TAYLOR AND MACLAURIN SERIES
In the preceding section we were able to ﬁnd power series representations for a certain
restricted class of functions. Here we investigate more general problems: Which functions
have power series representations? How can we ﬁnd such representations?
We start by supposing that 
is any function that can be represented by a power series
Let’s try to determine what the coefﬁcients 
must be in terms of . To begin, notice that
if we put 
in Equation 1, then all terms after the ﬁrst one are 0 and we get
By Theorem 11.9.2, we can differentiate the series in Equation 1 term by term:
and substitution of 
in Equation 2 gives

Now we differentiate both sides of Equation 2 and obtain
Again we put 
in Equation 3. The result is
Let’s apply the procedure one more time. Differentiation of the series in Equation 3 gives
and substitution of 
in Equation 4 gives
By now you can see the pattern. If we continue to differentiate and substitute 
, we
obtain
Solving this equation for the 
coefﬁcient 
This formula remains valid even for 
if we adopt the conventions that 
and
. Thus we have proved the following theorem.
THEOREM If 
has a power series representation (expansion) at , that is, if
then its coefﬁcients are given by the formula
Substituting this formula for 
back into the series, we see that if
has a power series
expansion at , then it must be of the following form.

The series in Equation 6 is called the Taylor series of the function f at a (or about a
or centered at a). For the special case 
the Taylor series becomes
This case arises frequently enough that it is given the special name Maclaurin series.
We have shown that if
can be represented as a power series about , then 
is
equal to the sum of its Taylor series. But there exist functions that are not equal to the sum
of their Taylor series. An example of such a function is given in Exercise 70.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the Maclaurin series of the function 
and its radius of 
convergence.
SOLUTION If 
, then 
, so 
for all . Therefore the
Taylor series for 
at 0 (that is, the Maclaurin series) is
To ﬁnd the radius of convergence we let 
. Then
so, by the Ratio Test, the series converges for all and the radius of convergence 
is 
.
M
The conclusion we can draw from Theorem 5 and Example 1 is that if
has a power
series expansion at 0, then
So how can we determine whether 
does have a power series representation?
Let’s investigate the more general question: Under what circumstances is a function
equal to the sum of its Taylor series? In other words, if has derivatives of all orders, when
is it true that
As with any convergent series, this means that 
is the limit of the sequence of partial
sums. In the case of the Taylor series, the partial sums are

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
The Taylor series is named after the English 
mathematician Brook Taylor (1685–1731) and the
Maclaurin series is named in honor of the Scot-
tish mathematician Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746)
despite the fact that the Maclaurin series is 
really just a special case of the Taylor series. But
the idea of representing particular functions as
sums of power series goes back to Newton, and
the general Taylor series was known to the Scot-
tish mathematician James Gregory in 1668 and 
to the Swiss mathematician John Bernoulli in 
the 1690s. Taylor was apparently unaware of the
work of Gregory and Bernoulli when he published
his discoveries on series in 1715 in his book
Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa.
Maclaurin series are named after Colin Maclau-
rin because he popularized them in his calculus
textbook Treatise of Fluxions published in 1742.
TAYLOR AND MACLAURIN

Notice that 
is a polynomial of degree 
called the nth-degree Taylor polynomial of f
at a. For instance, for the exponential function 
, the result of Example 1 shows
that the Taylor polynomials at 0 (or Maclaurin polynomials) with 
, 2, and 3 are
The graphs of the exponential function and these three Taylor polynomials are drawn in
Figure 1.
In general,

If we let

then 
is called the remainder of the Taylor series. If we can somehow show that
, then it follows that
We have therefore proved the following.

In trying to show that 
for a speciﬁc function , we usually use the
following fact.

In Section 11.11 we will explore the use of Taylor’s Inequality in approxi-
mating functions. Our immediate use of it is in conjunction with Theorem 8.
In applying Theorems 8 and 9 it is often helpful to make use of the following fact.

This is true because we know from Example 1 that the series 
converges for all

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
N As alternatives to Taylor’s Inequality, we have
the following formulas for the remainder term. If
is continuous on an interval and 
,
then
This is called the integral form of the remainder
term. Another formula, called Lagrange’s form of
the remainder term, states that there is a number
between and such that
This version is an extension of the Mean Value
Theorem (which is the case 
).
Proofs of these formulas, together with dis-
cussions of how to use them to solve the exam-
ples of Sections 11.10 and 11.11, are given on the

In particular, if we put 
in Equation 11, we obtain the following expression
for the number as a sum of an inﬁnite series:

SOLUTION We have 
and so, putting 
in the deﬁnition of a Taylor series
(6), we get
Again it can be veriﬁed, as in Example 1, that the radius of convergence is

Example 2 we can verify that

We have two power series expansions for 
, the Maclaurin series in Equation 11 and
the Taylor series in Equation 13. The ﬁrst is better if we are interested in values of near
0 and the second is better if is near 2.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the Maclaurin series for

for all .

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Using the binomial series with 
and with replaced by

We know from (17) that this series converges when 
, that is,
, so the
radius of convergence is 
.
M
We collect in the following table, for future reference, some important Maclaurin series
that we have derived in this section and the preceding one.
One reason that Taylor series are important is that they enable us to integrate functions
that we couldn’t previously handle. In fact, in the introduction to this chapter we men-
tioned that Newton often integrated functions by ﬁrst expressing them as power series and
then integrating the series term by term. The function 
can’t be integrated by
techniques discussed so far because its antiderivative is not an elementary function (see
Section 7.5). In the following example we use Newton’s idea to integrate this function.

(a) Evaluate 
as an inﬁnite series.
(b) Evaluate 
correct to within an error of 
.
SOLUTION
(a) First we ﬁnd the Maclaurin series for 
. Although it’s possible to use the
direct method, let’s ﬁnd it simply by replacing with 
in the series for 
given in
Table 1. Thus, for all values of x,
Now we integrate term by term:
This series converges for all because the original series for 
converges for all .
(b) The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives
The Alternating Series Estimation Theorem shows that the error involved in this approxi-
mation is less than
M
Another use of Taylor series is illustrated in the next example. The limit could be found
with l’Hospital’s Rule, but instead we use a series.

N Some computer algebra systems compute

MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF POWER SERIES
If power series are added or subtracted, they behave like polynomials (Theorem 11.2.8
shows this). In fact, as the following example illustrates, they can also be multiplied and
divided like polynomials. We ﬁnd only the ﬁrst few terms because the calculations for the
later terms become tedious and the initial terms are the most important ones.
EXAMPLE 12 Find the ﬁrst three nonzero terms in the Maclaurin series for (a) 
and (b) 
.
SOLUTION
(a) Using the Maclaurin series for 
and 
in Table 1, we have
We multiply these expressions, collecting like terms just as for polynomials:
Thus
(b) Using the Maclaurin series in Table 1, we have
We use a procedure like long division:
Thus
M
Although we have not attempted to justify the formal manipulations used in Exam-
ple 12, they are legitimate. There is a theorem which states that if both 
and
converge for 
and the series are multiplied as if they were polyno-
mials, then the resulting series also converges for 
and represents 
. For
division we require 
; the resulting series converges for sufﬁciently small 
.

The Binomial Theorem, which gives the expansion of 
, was known to Chinese mathe-
maticians many centuries before the time of Newton for the case where the exponent k is a 
positive integer. In 1665, when he was 22, Newton was the ﬁrst to discover the inﬁnite series
expansion of 
when k is a fractional exponent (positive or negative). He didn’t publish 
his discovery, but he stated it and gave examples of how to use it in a letter (now called the 
epistola prior) dated June 13, 1676, that he sent to Henry Oldenburg, secretary of the Royal
Society of London, to transmit to Leibniz. When Leibniz replied, he asked how Newton had
discovered the binomial series. Newton wrote a second letter, the epistola posterior of Octo-
ber 24, 1676, in which he explained in great detail how he arrived at his discovery by a very
indirect route. He was investigating the areas under the curves 
from 0 to x for
, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . . These are easy to calculate if n is even. By observing patterns and inter-
polating, Newton was able to guess the answers for odd values of n. Then he realized he could
get the same answers by expressing 
as an inﬁnite series.
Write a report on Newton’s discovery of the binomial series. Start by giving the statement of
the binomial series in Newton’s notation (see the epistola prior on page 285 of [4] or page 402 
of [2]). Explain why Newton’s version is equivalent to Theorem 17 on page 742. Then read
Newton’s epistola posterior (page 287 in [4] or page 404 in [2]) and explain the patterns that
Newton discovered in the areas under the curves 
. Show how he was able to 
guess the areas under the remaining curves and how he veriﬁed his answers. Finally, explain how
these discoveries led to the binomial series. The books by Edwards [1] and Katz [3] contain
commentaries on Newton’s letters.

APPLICATIONS OF TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS
In this section we explore two types of applications of Taylor polynomials. First we look
at how they are used to approximate functions––computer scientists like them because
polynomials are the simplest of functions. Then we investigate how physicists and engi-
neers use them in such ﬁelds as relativity, optics, blackbody radiation, electric dipoles, the
velocity of water waves, and building highways across a desert.
APPROXIMATING FUNCTIONS BY POLYNOMIALS
Suppose that 
is equal to the sum of its Taylor series at a:
In Section 11.10 we introduced the notation 
for the th partial sum of this series
and called it the th-degree Taylor polynomial of 
at . Thus
Since 
is the sum of its Taylor series, we know that 
as 
and so 
can
be used as an approximation to :
.
Notice that the ﬁrst-degree Taylor polynomial
is the same as the linearization of f at a that we discussed in Section 3.10. Notice also that
and its derivative have the same values at a that
and 
have. In general, it can be
shown that the derivatives of 
at 
agree with those of 
up to and including derivatives
of order (see Exercise 38).
To illustrate these ideas let’s take another look at the graphs of 
and its ﬁrst few
Taylor polynomials, as shown in Figure 1. The graph of 
is the tangent line to 
at 
; this tangent line is the best linear approximation to 
near 
. The graph 
of 
is the parabola 
, and the graph of 
is the cubic curve
, which is a closer ﬁt to the exponential curve 
than 
.
The next Taylor polynomial 
would be an even better approximation, and so on.
The values in the table give a numerical demonstration of the convergence of the Taylor
polynomials 
to the function 
. We see that when 
the convergence is
very rapid, but when 
it is somewhat slower. In fact, the farther is from 0, the more
slowly 
converges to 
.
When using a Taylor polynomial 
to approximate a function , we have to ask the
questions: How good an approximation is it? How large should we take to be in order to
achieve a desired accuracy? To answer these questions we need to look at the absolute
value of the remainder:

There are three possible methods for estimating the size of the error:
1. If a graphing device is available, we can use it to graph 
and thereby esti-
mate the error.
2. If the series happens to be an alternating series, we can use the Alternating Series
Estimation Theorem.
3. In all cases we can use Taylor’s Inequality (Theorem 11.10.9), which says that if
, then

(b) How accurate is this approximation when

SOLUTION
(a)
Thus the second-degree Taylor polynomial is
The desired approximation is
(b) The Taylor series is not alternating when 
, so we can’t use the Alternating
Series Estimation Theorem in this example. But we can use Taylor’s Inequality with

CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Let’s use a graphing device to check the calculation in Example 1. Figure 2 shows that
the graphs of 
and 
are very close to each other when 
is near 8. Fig-
ure 3 shows the graph of 
computed from the expression
We see from the graph that
when 
. Thus the error estimate from graphical methods is slightly better than the
error estimate from Taylor’s Inequality in this case.
EXAMPLE 2
(a) What is the maximum error possible in using the approximation 
when 
? Use this approximation to ﬁnd 
correct to six decimal
places.
(b) For what values of is this approximation accurate to within 
?
SOLUTION
(a) Notice that the Maclaurin series
is alternating for all nonzero values of , and the successive terms decrease in size
because 
, so we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The error 
in approximating 
by the ﬁrst three terms of its Maclaurin series is at most
If 
, then 
, so the error is smaller than
To ﬁnd 
we ﬁrst convert to radian measure.
Thus, correct to six decimal places,
.
(b) The error will be smaller than 
if

Solving this inequality for , we get
So the given approximation is accurate to within

M
What if we use Taylor’s Inequality to solve Example 2? Since 
, we
have 
and so
So we get the same estimates as with the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.
What about graphical methods? Figure 4 shows the graph of
and we see from it that 
when 
. This is the same estimate
that we obtained in Example 2. For part (b) we want 
, so we graph both
and 
in Figure 5. By placing the cursor on the right intersection
point we ﬁnd that the inequality is satisﬁed when 
. Again this is the same esti-
mate that we obtained in the solution to Example 2.
If we had been asked to approximate 
instead of 
in Example 2, it would
have been wise to use the Taylor polynomials at 
(instead of 
) because they
are better approximations to 
for values of close to 
. Notice that 
is close to
(or 
radians) and the derivatives of 
are easy to compute at 
.
Figure 6 shows the graphs of the Maclaurin polynomial approximations
to the sine curve. You can see that as increases,
is a good approximation to 
on
a larger and larger interval.
One use of the type of calculation done in Examples 1 and 2 occurs in calculators and
computers. For instance, when you press the 
or 
key on your calculator, or when a
computer programmer uses a subroutine for a trigonometric or exponential or Bessel func-
tion, in many machines a polynomial approximation is calculated. The polynomial is often
a Taylor polynomial that has been modiﬁed so that the error is spread more evenly through-
out an interval.
APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS
Taylor polynomials are also used frequently in physics. In order to gain insight into an
equation, a physicist often simpliﬁes a function by considering only the ﬁrst two or three
terms in its Taylor series. In other words, the physicist uses a Taylor polynomial as an

Another application to physics occurs in optics. Figure 8 is adapted from Optics,
4th ed., by Eugene Hecht (San Francisco: Addison-Wesley, 2002), page 153. It depicts a
wave from the point source S meeting a spherical interface of radius R centered at C. The
ray SA is refracted toward P.
Using Fermat’s principle that light travels so as to minimize the time taken, Hecht
derives the equation
where 
and 
are indexes of refraction and 
, , , and 
are the distances indicated in
Figure 8. By the Law of Cosines, applied to triangles ACS and ACP, we have
Because Equation 1 is cumbersome to work with, Gauss, in 1841, simpliﬁed it by using
the linear approximation 
for small values of 
. (This amounts to using the
Taylor polynomial of degree 1.) Then Equation 1 becomes the following simpler equation
[as you are asked to show in Exercise 34(a)]:
The resulting optical theory is known as Gaussian optics, or ﬁrst-order optics, and has
become the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses.
A more accurate theory is obtained by approximating 
by its Taylor polynomial of
degree 3 (which is the same as the Taylor polynomial of degree 2). This takes into account
rays for which 
is not so small, that is, rays that strike the surface at greater distances h
above the axis. In Exercise 34(b) you are asked to use this approximation to derive the

A car is moving with speed 20 ms and acceleration 2 ms
at a given instant. Using a second-degree Taylor polynomial,
estimate how far the car moves in the next second. Would it
be reasonable to use this polynomial to estimate the distance
traveled during the next minute?
32. The resistivity 
of a conducting wire is the reciprocal of the
conductivity and is measured in units of ohm-meters (
-m).
The resistivity of a given metal depends on the temperature
according to the equation
where is the temperature in 
. There are tables that list the
values of 
(called the temperature coefﬁcient) and 
(the
resistivity at 
C) for various metals. Except at very low
temperatures, the resistivity varies almost linearly with tem-
perature and so it is common to approximate the expression
for 
by its ﬁrst- or second-degree Taylor polynomial 
at

(a) Find expressions for these linear and quadratic
approximations.

Any object emits radiation when heated. A blackbody is a system that absorbs all the radiation
that falls on it. For instance, a matte black surface or a large cavity with a small hole in its wall
(like a blastfurnace) is a blackbody and emits blackbody radiation. Even the radiation from the
sun is close to being blackbody radiation.
Proposed in the late 19th century, the Rayleigh-Jeans Law expresses the energy density of
blackbody radiation of wavelength 
as
where 
is measured in meters, 
is the temperature in kelvins (K), and is Boltzmann’s con-
stant. The Rayleigh-Jeans Law agrees with experimental measurements for long wavelengths 
but disagrees drastically for short wavelengths. [The law predicts that 
as 
but
experiments have shown that 
.] This fact is known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.
In 1900 Max Planck found a better model (known now as Planck’s Law) for blackbody 
radiation:
where 
is measured in meters, 
is the temperature (in kelvins), and
1. Use l’Hospital’s Rule to show that
for Planck’s Law. So this law models blackbody radiation better than the Rayleigh-Jeans
Law for short wavelengths.

VECTORS AND THE
GEOMETRY OF SPACE
12
In this chapter we introduce vectors and coordinate systems for three-dimensional
space. This will be the setting for our study of the calculus of functions of two variables
in Chapter 14 because the graph of such a function is a surface in space. In this chapter
we will see that vectors provide particularly simple descriptions of lines and planes 
in space.
Wind velocity is a vector because it has both magnitude
and direction. Pictured are velocity vectors showing 
the wind pattern over the North Atlantic and Western
Europe on February 28, 2007. Larger arrows indicate
stronger winds.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL COORDINATE SYSTEMS
To locate a point in a plane, two numbers are necessary. We know that any point in 
the plane can be represented as an ordered pair 
of real numbers, where 
is the 
-coordinate and is the -coordinate. For this reason, a plane is called two-dimensional.
To locate a point in space, three numbers are required. We represent any point in space by
an ordered triple 
of real numbers.
In order to represent points in space, we ﬁrst choose a ﬁxed point 
(the origin) and
three directed lines through 
that are perpendicular to each other, called the coordinate
axes and labeled the -axis, -axis, and -axis. Usually we think of the - and -axes as
being horizontal and the -axis as being vertical, and we draw the orientation of the axes
as in Figure 1. The direction of the -axis is determined by the right-hand rule as illus-
trated in Figure 2: If you curl the ﬁngers of your right hand around the -axis in the direc-
tion of a 
counterclockwise rotation from the positive -axis to the positive -axis, then
your thumb points in the positive direction of the -axis.
The three coordinate axes determine the three coordinate planes illustrated in Fig-
ure 3(a). The 
-plane is the plane that contains the - and -axes; the 
-plane contains
the - and -axes; the 
-plane contains the - and -axes. These three coordinate planes
divide space into eight parts, called octants. The ﬁrst octant, in the foreground, is deter-
mined by the positive axes.
Because many people have some difﬁculty visualizing diagrams of three-dimensional
ﬁgures, you may ﬁnd it helpful to do the following [see Figure 3(b)]. Look at any bottom
corner of a room and call the corner the origin. The wall on your left is in the 
-plane, the
wall on your right is in the 
-plane, and the ﬂoor is in the 
-plane. The -axis runs along
the intersection of the ﬂoor and the left wall. The -axis runs along the intersection of the
ﬂoor and the right wall. The -axis runs up from the ﬂoor toward the ceiling along the inter-
section of the two walls. You are situated in the ﬁrst octant, and you can now imagine seven
other rooms situated in the other seven octants (three on the same ﬂoor and four on the
ﬂoor below), all connected by the common corner point .
Now if 
is any point in space, let 
be the (directed) distance from the 
-plane to 
let 
be the distance from the 
-plane to 
and let be the distance from the 
-plane to
. We represent the point
by the ordered triple
of real numbers and we call
,
, and 
the coordinates of ; 
is the -coordinate, 
is the -coordinate, and 
is the 
-coordinate. Thus, to locate the point 
, we can start at the origin 
and move units
along the -axis, then 
units parallel to the -axis, and then 
units parallel to the -axis
as in Figure 4.

The point 
determines a rectangular box as in Figure 5. If we drop a perpen-
dicular from 
to the 
-plane, we get a point 
with coordinates 
called the pro-
jection of 
on the 
-plane. Similarly, 
and 
are the projections of 
on
the 
-plane and 
-plane, respectively.
As numerical illustrations, the points 
and 
are plotted in Fig-
ure 6.
The Cartesian product 
is the set of all ordered
triples of real numbers and is denoted by 
. We have given a one-to-one correspon-
dence between points 
in space and ordered triples 
in 
. It is called a three-
dimensional rectangular coordinate system. Notice that, in terms of coordinates, the
ﬁrst octant can be described as the set of points whose coordinates are all positive.
In two-dimensional analytic geometry, the graph of an equation involving 
and 
is a
curve in 
. In three-dimensional analytic geometry, an equation in , , and represents
a surface in 
.

and three units above it as in Figure 7(a).
(b) The equation 
represents the set of all points in 
whose -coordinate is 5.
This is the vertical plane that is parallel to the 
-plane and ﬁve units to the right of it as
in Figure 7(b).

CHAPTER 12 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE

When an equation is given, we must understand from the context whether it rep-
resents a curve in
or a surface in
. In Example 1,
represents a plane in
, but
of course 
can also represent a line in 
if we are dealing with two-dimensional ana-
lytic geometry. See Figure 7(b) and (c).
In general, if 
is a constant, then 
represents a plane parallel to the
-plane,
is a plane parallel to the 
-plane, and 
is a plane parallel to the 
-plane. In
Figure 5, the faces of the rectangular box are formed by the three coordinate planes 
(the
-plane),
(the
-plane), and
(the
-plane), and the planes
,
,
and 
.
EXAMPLE 2 Describe and sketch the surface in 
represented by the equation 
.
SOLUTION The equation represents the set of all points in 
whose - and -coordinates
are equal, that is, 
. This is a vertical plane that intersects the 
-plane in the line 
, 
. The portion of this plane that lies in the ﬁrst octant is
sketched in Figure 8.
M
The familiar formula for the distance between two points in a plane is easily extended
to the following three-dimensional formula.
DISTANCE FORMULA IN THREE DIMENSIONS The distance 
between the
points 
and 
is
To see why this formula is true, we construct a rectangular box as in Figure 9, where 
and 
are opposite vertices and the faces of the box are parallel to the coordinate planes.
If 
and 
are the vertices of the box indicated in the ﬁgure, then
Because triangles 
and 
are both right-angled, two applications of the Pythago-
rean Theorem give
and
Combining these equations, we get

The result of Example 4 is worth remembering.

In particular, if the center is the origin , then an equation of the sphere is
EXAMPLE 5 Show that

SOLUTION We can rewrite the given equation in the form of an equation of a sphere if we
complete squares:
Comparing this equation with the standard form, we see that it is the equation of a
sphere with center 
and radius

EXAMPLE 6 What region in

SOLUTION The inequalities
can be rewritten as
so they represent the points 
whose distance from the origin is at least 1 and at
most 2. But we are also given that 
, so the points lie on or below the xy-plane. 
Thus the given inequalities represent the region that lies between (or on) the spheres
and 
and beneath (or on) the xy-plane. It is sketched
in Figure 11.

CHAPTER 12 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE
VECTORS
The term vector is used by scientists to indicate a quantity (such as displacement or veloc-
ity or force) that has both magnitude and direction. A vector is often represented by an
arrow or a directed line segment. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the
vector and the arrow points in the direction of the vector. We denote a vector by printing a
letter in boldface 
or by putting an arrow above the letter 
For instance, suppose a particle moves along a line segment from point 
to point .
The corresponding displacement vector , shown in Figure 1, has initial point
(the tail)
and terminal point
(the tip) and we indicate this by writing 
AB
l. Notice that the vec-
tor 
CD
l has the same length and the same direction as 
even though it is in a differ-
ent position. We say that 
and are equivalent (or equal) and we write 
. The zero
vector, denoted by 0, has length . It is the only vector with no speciﬁc direction.
COMBINING VECTORS
Suppose a particle moves from 
, so its displacement vector is AB
l. Then the particle
changes direction and moves from 
, with displacement vector BC
las in Figure 2. The
combined effect of these displacements is that the particle has moved from 
. The
resulting displacement vector AC
l is called the sum of AB
l and BC
l and we write
AC
l
AB
l
BC
l
In general, if we start with vectors and , we ﬁrst move so that its tail coincides with
the tip of 
and deﬁne the sum of 
and as follows.
DEFINITION OF VECTOR ADDITION If 
and are vectors positioned so the initial
point of is at the terminal point of , then the sum
is the vector from the
initial point of

The deﬁnition of vector addition is illustrated in Figure 3. You can see why this deﬁni-
tion is sometimes called the Triangle Law.
In Figure 4 we start with the same vectors 
and 
as in Figure 3 and draw another 
copy of 
with the same initial point as . Completing the parallelogram, we see that
. This also gives another way to construct the sum: If we place 
and so
they start at the same point, then 
lies along the diagonal of the parallelogram with
and as sides. (This is called the Parallelogram Law.)
EXAMPLE 1 Draw the sum of the vectors 
shown in Figure 5.
SOLUTION First we translate 
and place its tail at the tip of , being careful to draw a 
copy of 
that has the same length and direction. Then we draw the vector 
[see
Figure 6(a)] starting at the initial point of and ending at the terminal point of the 
copy of .
Alternatively, we could place 
so it starts where 
starts and construct 
by the
Parallelogram Law as in Figure 6(b).
M
It is possible to multiply a vector by a real number . (In this context we call the real
number a scalar to distinguish it from a vector.) For instance, we want 
to be the same
vector as 
, which has the same direction as but is twice as long. In general, we mul-
tiply a vector by a scalar as follows.
DEFINITION OF SCALAR MULTIPLICATION If is a scalar and 
is a vector, then the
scalar multiple
is the vector whose length is 
times the length of 
and
whose direction is the same as if 
and is opposite to if 
. If 
or 
, then 
.
This deﬁnition is illustrated in Figure 7. We see that real numbers work like scaling fac-
tors here; that’s why we call them scalars. Notice that two nonzero vectors are parallel if
they are scalar multiples of one another. In particular, the vector 
has the same
length as but points in the opposite direction. We call it the negative of .

So we can construct 
by ﬁrst drawing the negative of , 
, and then adding it to
by the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 8(a). Alternatively, since
the vec-
tor 
, when added to , gives . So we could construct 
as in Figure 8(b) by
means of the Triangle Law.
EXAMPLE 2 If 
are the vectors shown in Figure 9, draw

SOLUTION We ﬁrst draw the vector 
pointing in the direction opposite to 
and twice
as long. We place it with its tail at the tip of and then use the Triangle Law to draw
as in Figure 10.
M
COMPONENTS
For some purposes it’s best to introduce a coordinate system and treat vectors algebra-
ically. If we place the initial point of a vector 
at the origin of a rectangular coordinate
system, then the terminal point of 
has coordinates of the form 
or 
,
depending on whether our coordinate system is two- or three-dimensional (see Figure 11).
These coordinates are called the components of and we write
or
We use the notation 
for the ordered pair that refers to a vector so as not to confuse
it with the ordered pair 
that refers to a point in the plane.
For instance, the vectors shown in Figure 12 are all equivalent to the vector
OP
l
whose terminal point is 
. What they have in common is that the ter-
minal point is reached from the initial point by a displacement of three units to the right 
and two upward. We can think of all these geometric vectors as representations of the

is denoted by the symbol 
or 
. By using the distance formula to compute the length
of a segment 
, we obtain the following formulas.
The length of the two-dimensional vector 
is

How do we add vectors algebraically? Figure 14 shows that if 
and
, then the sum is 
, at least for the case where the
components are positive. In other words, to add algebraic vectors we add their compo-
nents. Similarly, to subtract vectors we subtract components. From the similar triangles in
Figure 15 we see that the components of 
are 
and 
. So to multiply a vector by a
scalar we multiply each component by that scalar.

These eight properties of vectors can be readily veriﬁed either geometrically or alge-
braically. For instance, Property 1 can be seen from Figure 4 (it’s equivalent to the Paral-
lelogram Law) or as follows for the case 
:
We can see why Property 2 (the associative law) is true by looking at Figure 16 and
applying the Triangle Law several times: The vector PQ
l is obtained either by ﬁrst con-
structing a  b and then adding c or by adding a to the vector b  c.

N Vectors in dimensions are used to list vari-
ous quantities in an organized way. For instance,
the components of a six-dimensional vector
might represent the prices of six different ingre-
dients required to make a particular product.
Four-dimensional vectors 
are used in
relativity theory, where the ﬁrst three compo-
nents specify a position in space and the fourth
represents time.

APPLICATIONS
Vectors are useful in many aspects of physics and engineering. In Chapter 13 we will see
how they describe the velocity and acceleration of objects moving in space. Here we look
at forces.
A force is represented by a vector because it has both a magnitude (measured in pounds
or newtons) and a direction. If several forces are acting on an object, the resultant force
experienced by the object is the vector sum of these forces.
EXAMPLE 7 A 100-lb weight hangs from two wires as shown in Figure 19. Find the
tensions (forces)

SOLUTION We ﬁrst express 
and 
in terms of their horizontal and vertical components.
From Figure 20 we see that
.
The resultant 
of the tensions counterbalances the weight 
and so we must have
Thus
Equating components, we get
Solving the ﬁrst of these equations for 
and substituting into the second, we get
So the magnitudes of the tensions are
and
Substituting these values in (5) and (6), we obtain the tension vectors

CHAPTER 12 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE

THE DOT PRODUCT
So far we have added two vectors and multiplied a vector by a scalar. The question arises:
Is it possible to multiply two vectors so that their product is a useful quantity? One such
product is the dot product, whose deﬁnition follows. Another is the cross product, which
is discussed in the next section.
DEFINITION If 
and 
, then the dot product of
and 
is the number 
given by
Thus, to ﬁnd the dot product of 
and , we multiply corresponding components and
add. The result is not a vector. It is a real number, that is, a scalar. For this reason, the dot
product is sometimes called the scalar product (or inner product). Although Deﬁnition 1
is given for three-dimensional vectors, the dot product of two-dimensional vectors is
deﬁned in a similar fashion:
EXAMPLE 1
M
The dot product obeys many of the laws that hold for ordinary products of real num-
bers. These are stated in the following theorem.
PROPERTIES OF THE DOT PRODUCT If , , and are vectors in 
and is a
scalar, then

These properties are easily proved using Deﬁnition 1. For instance, here are the proofs
of Properties 1 and 3:

The proofs of the remaining properties are left as exercises.

The dot product 
can be given a geometric interpretation in terms of the angle 
between

Two nonzero vectors 
and 
are called perpendicular or orthogonal if the angle
between them is 
. Then Theorem 3 gives
and conversely if 
, then 
, so 
. The zero vector is considered
to be perpendicular to all vectors. Therefore we have the following method for determin-
ing whether two vectors are orthogonal.
Two vectors

Because

as measuring 
the extent to which a and b point in the same direction. The dot product 
is positive
if a and b point in the same general direction, 0 if they are perpendicular, and negative if
they point in generally opposite directions (see Figure 2). In the extreme case where a and
b point in exactly the same direction, we have 
, so 
and
If a and b point in exactly opposite directions, then

DIRECTION ANGLES AND DIRECTION COSINES
The direction angles of a nonzero vector are the angles , , and
(in the interval
that makes with the positive -, -, and -axes. (See Figure 3.)
The cosines of these direction angles, 
, 
, and 
, are called the direction
cosines of the vector . Using Corollary 6 with 
replaced by , we obtain

The vector projection is this scalar projection times the unit vector in the direction of :
M
One use of projections occurs in physics in calculating work. In Section 6.4 we deﬁned
the work done by a constant force
in moving an object through a distance
as
,
but this applies only when the force is directed along the line of motion of the object.
Suppose, however, that the constant force is a vector 
PR
l pointing in some other direc-
tion, as in Figure 6. If the force moves the object from 
to 
, then the displacement 
vector is

CHAPTER 12 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE
THE CROSS PRODUCT
The cross product
of two vectors 
and , unlike the dot product, is a vector. For
this reason it is also called the vector product. Note that 
is deﬁned only when and
are three-dimensional vectors.
DEFINITION If 
and 
, then the cross product
of and 
is the vector
This may seem like a strange way of deﬁning a product. The reason for the particular
form of Deﬁnition 1 is that the cross product deﬁned in this way has many useful proper-
ties, as we will soon see. In particular, we will show that the vector 
is perpendicu-
lar to both and .
In order to make Deﬁnition 1 easier to remember, we use the notation of determinants.
A determinant of order 2 is deﬁned by
For example,
A determinant of order 3 can be deﬁned in terms of second-order determinants as 
follows:

Observe that each term on the right side of Equation 2 involves a number 
in the ﬁrst row
of the determinant, and 
is multiplied by the second-order determinant obtained from the
left side by deleting the row and column in which 
appears. Notice also the minus sign
in the second term. For example,
If we now rewrite Deﬁnition 1 using second-order determinants and the standard basis
vectors , , and , we see that the cross product of the vectors 
and
is
In view of the similarity between Equations 2 and 3, we often write
Although the ﬁrst row of the symbolic determinant in Equation 4 consists of vectors, if we
expand it as if it were an ordinary determinant using the rule in Equation 2, we obtain
Equation 3. The symbolic formula in Equation 4 is probably the easiest way of remember-
ing and computing cross products.

SECTION 12.4 THE CROSS PRODUCT
||||
787

One of the most important properties of the cross product is given by the following 
theorem.
THEOREM The vector 
is orthogonal to both and .
PROOF
In order to show that 
is orthogonal to , we compute their dot product as
follows:
A similar computation shows that 
. Therefore 
is orthogonal to
both and .
M
If 
and 
are represented by directed line segments with the same initial point (as in
Figure 1), then Theorem 5 says that the cross product 
points in a direction perpen-
dicular to the plane through and . It turns out that the direction of 
is given by the
right-hand rule: If the ﬁngers of your right hand curl in the direction of a rotation (through
an angle less than 
) from to , then your thumb points in the direction of 
.
Now that we know the direction of the vector 
, the remaining thing we need to
complete its geometric description is its length 
. This is given by the following 
theorem.
THEOREM If 
is the angle between 
and 
(so 
), then
PROOF
From the deﬁnitions of the cross product and length of a vector, we have
(by Theorem 12.3.3)
Taking square roots and observing that 
because 
when
, we have
M
Since a vector is completely determined by its magnitude and direction, we can now say
that 
is the vector that is perpendicular to both 
and , whose orientation is deter-

COROLLARY Two nonzero vectors and

PROOF
Two nonzero vectors and 
are parallel if and only if 
or . In either case
, so 
and therefore 
.
M
The geometric interpretation of Theorem 6 can be seen by looking at Figure 2. If and
are represented by directed line segments with the same initial point, then they determine
a parallelogram with base 
, altitude 
, and area
Thus we have the following way of interpreting the magnitude of a cross product.
The length of the cross product 
is equal to the area of the parallelogram
determined by and .
EXAMPLE 3 Find a vector perpendicular to the plane that passes through the points
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION The vector PQ
l
PR
l is perpendicular to both PQ
l and PR
l and is therefore per-
pendicular to the plane through , , and . We know from (12.2.1) that
PQ
l
PR
l
We compute the cross product of these vectors:
PQ
l
PR
l
So the vector 
is perpendicular to the given plane. Any nonzero scalar
multiple of this vector, such as 
, is also perpendicular to the plane.

CHAPTER 12 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE

The geometric signiﬁcance of the scalar triple product can be seen by considering the
parallelepiped determined by the vectors , , and . (See Figure 3.) The area of the base 
parallelogram is 
. If 
is the angle between 
and 
, then the height 
of the parallelepiped is 
. (We must use 
instead of 
in case
.) Therefore the volume of the parallelepiped is
Thus we have proved the following formula.
The volume of the parallelepiped determined by the vectors , , and is the
magnitude of their scalar triple product:
If we use the formula in (11) and discover that the volume of the parallelepiped 
determined by a, b, and c is 0, then the vectors must lie in the same plane; that is, they are
coplanar.
EXAMPLE 5 Use the scalar triple product to show that the vectors 
,
, and 
are coplanar.
SOLUTION We use Equation 10 to compute their scalar triple product:
Therefore, by (11), the volume of the parallelepiped determined by , , and is 0. This
means that , , and are coplanar.
M
The product 
that occurs in Property 6 is called the vector triple product
of , , and . Property 6 will be used to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion in
Chapter 13. Its proof is left as Exercise 46.
TORQUE
The idea of a cross product occurs often in physics. In particular, we consider a force 
acting on a rigid body at a point given by a position vector . (For instance, if we tighten
a bolt by applying a force to a wrench as in Figure 4, we produce a turning effect.) The
torque
(relative to the origin) is deﬁned to be the cross product of the position and force
vectors
and measures the tendency of the body to rotate about the origin. The direction of the
torque vector indicates the axis of rotation. According to Theorem 6, the magnitude of the

EQUATIONS OF LINES AND PLANES
A line in the 
-plane is determined when a point on the line and the direction of the line
(its slope or angle of inclination) are given. The equation of the line can then be written
using the point-slope form.
Likewise, a line 
in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point
on 
and the direction of . In three dimensions the direction of a line is con-
veniently described by a vector, so we let 
be a vector parallel to . Let 
be an
arbitrary point on 
and let 
and be the position vectors of 
and 
(that is, they have
representations OP
A and OP
A). If 
is the vector with representation P P
A, as in Figure 1,
then the Triangle Law for vector addition gives 
. But, since and are parallel
vectors, there is a scalar such that

of a point on . In other words, as varies, the line is traced out by the tip of the vec-
tor . As Figure 2 indicates, positive values of correspond to points on

If the vector 
that gives the direction of the line

. We can also write

Two vectors are equal if and only if corresponding components are equal. Therefore we
have the three scalar equations:
where 
. These equations are called parametric equations of the line 
through the
point 
and parallel to the vector 
. Each value of the parameter 
gives a point 
on .
EXAMPLE 1

M
The vector equation and parametric equations of a line are not unique. If we change the
point or the parameter or choose a different parallel vector, then the equations change. For
instance, if, instead of 
, we choose the point 
in Example 1, then the para-
metric equations of the line become
Or, if we stay with the point 
but choose the parallel vector

arrive at the equations

used as a set of direction numbers for .
Another way of describing a line 
is to eliminate the parameter from Equations 2. If
none of , , or is , we can solve each of these equations for , equate the results, and
obtain
These equations are called symmetric equations of . Notice that the numbers , , and
that appear in the denominators of Equations 3 are direction numbers of , that is, com-
ponents of a vector parallel to . If one of , , or 
is , we can still eliminate . For
instance, if

This means that

EXAMPLE 2
(a) Find parametric equations and symmetric equations of the line that passes through
the points 
and 
.
(b) At what point does this line intersect the 
-plane?
SOLUTION
(a) We are not explicitly given a vector parallel to the line, but observe that the vector 
with representation 
is parallel to the line and
Thus direction numbers are 
, 
, and 
. Taking the point 
as 
, we see that parametric equations (2) are
and symmetric equations (3) are
(b) The line intersects the 
-plane when 
, so we put 
in the symmetric equa-
tions and obtain
This gives 
and 
, so the line intersects the 
-plane at the point 
.

In general, the procedure of Example 2 shows that direction numbers of the line
through the points

are

Often, we need a description, not of an entire line, but of just a line segment. How, for
instance, could we describe the line segment 
in Example 2? If we put 
in the para-
metric equations in Example 2(a), we get the point 
and if we put 
we get
. So the line segment 
is described by the parametric equations
or by the corresponding vector equation
In general, we know from Equation 1 that the vector equation of a line through the (tip
of the) vector 
in the direction of a vector is 
. If the line also passes through
(the tip of) , then we can take 
and so its vector equation is
The line segment from 
to 
is given by the parameter interval 
.
The line segment from
to 
is given by the vector equation
EXAMPLE 3 Show that the lines 
and 
with parametric equations
are skew lines; that is, they do not intersect and are not parallel (and therefore do not lie
in the same plane).
SOLUTION The lines are not parallel because the corresponding vectors 
and
are not parallel. (Their components are not proportional.) If 
and 
had a
point of intersection, there would be values of and such that
But if we solve the ﬁrst two equations, we get 
and 
, and these values don’t
satisfy the third equation. Therefore there are no values of and that satisfy the three
equations, so 
and 
do not intersect. Thus 
and 
are skew lines.
M
PLANES
Although a line in space is determined by a point and a direction, a plane in space is 
more difﬁcult to describe. A single vector parallel to a plane is not enough to convey the
“direction” of the plane, but a vector perpendicular to the plane does completely specify
its direction. Thus a plane in space is determined by a point 
in the plane and
a vector 
that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector 
is called a normal 
vector. Let 
be an arbitrary point in the plane, and let 
and 
be the position
vectors of 
and . Then the vector 
is represented by P P
A. (See Figure 6.) The nor-
mal vector 
is orthogonal to every vector in the given plane. In particular, 
is orthogonal

which can be rewritten as
Either Equation 5 or Equation 6 is called a vector equation of the plane.
To obtain a scalar equation for the plane, we write 
,

Equation 7 is the scalar equation of the plane through

To ﬁnd the -intercept we set 
in this equation and obtain 
. Similarly, 
the -intercept is 4 and the -intercept is 3. This enables us to sketch the portion of the
plane that lies in the ﬁrst octant (see Figure 7).

Since both and 
lie in the plane, their cross product 
is orthogonal to the plane
and can be taken as the normal vector. Thus
With the point

SOLUTION We substitute the expressions for , , and from the parametric equations into

This simpliﬁes to

when the parameter value is

Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel. For instance, the planes
and 
are parallel because their normal vectors are
and 
and 
. If two planes are not parallel, then
they intersect in a straight line and the angle between the two planes is deﬁned as the acute
angle between their normal vectors (see angle 
in Figure 9).
EXAMPLE 7
(a) Find the angle between the planes 
and 
.
(b) Find symmetric equations for the line of intersection 
of these two planes.
SOLUTION
(a) The normal vectors of these planes are
and so, if is the angle between the planes, Corollary 12.3.6 gives
(b) We ﬁrst need to ﬁnd a point on . For instance, we can ﬁnd the point where the line
intersects the 
-plane by setting 
in the equations of both planes. This gives the
equations

Now we observe that, since 
lies in both planes, it is perpendicular to both of the
normal vectors. Thus a vector parallel to 
is given by the cross product
and so the symmetric equations of 
can be written as
M
Since a linear equation in , , and 
represents a plane and two nonparallel
planes intersect in a line, it follows that two linear equations can represent a line. The
points 
that satisfy both 
and 
lie on both of these planes, and so the pair of linear equations represents the line of inter-
section of the planes (if they are not parallel). For instance, in Example 7 the line 
was
given as the line of intersection of the planes 
and 
. The
symmetric equations that we found for 
could be written as
which is again a pair of linear equations. They exhibit 
as the line of intersection of the
planes 
and 
. (See Figure 11.)
In general, when we write the equations of a line in the symmetric form
we can regard the line as the line of intersection of the two planes
EXAMPLE 8 Find a formula for the distance 
from a point

plane 
.
SOLUTION Let 
be any point in the given plane and let 
be the vector
corresponding to P P
A. Then
From Figure 12 you can see that the distance 
from 
to the plane is equal to the
absolute value of the scalar projection of 
onto the normal vector

Since 
lies in the plane, its coordinates satisfy the equation of the plane and so we

EXAMPLE 9 Find the distance between the parallel planes 
and 
.
SOLUTION First we note that the planes are parallel because their normal vectors
and 
are parallel. To ﬁnd the distance 
between the planes, 
we choose any point on one plane and calculate its distance to the other plane. In par-
ticular, if we put 
in the equation of the ﬁrst plane, we get 
and so
is a point in this plane. By Formula 9, the distance between 
and the
plane 
is
So the distance between the planes is 
.
M
EXAMPLE 10 In Example 3 we showed that the lines
are skew. Find the distance between them.
SOLUTION Since the two lines 
and 
are skew, they can be viewed as lying on two 
parallel planes 
and 
. The distance between 
and 
is the same as the distance
between 
and 
, which can be computed as in Example 9. The common normal 
vector to both planes must be orthogonal to both 
(the direction of 
)
and 
(the direction of 
). So a normal vector is
If we put 
in the equations of 
, we get the point 
on 
and so an equa-
tion for 
is
If we now set 
in the equations for 
, we get the point 
on 
. So 
the distance between

Computer graphics programmers face the same challenge as the great painters of the past: how 
to represent a three-dimensional scene as a ﬂat image on a two-dimensional plane (a screen or a
canvas). To create the illusion of perspective, in which closer objects appear larger than those
farther away, three-dimensional objects in the computer’s memory are projected onto a rect-
angular screen window from a viewpoint where the eye, or camera, is located. The viewing
volume––the portion of space that will be visible––is the region contained by the four planes that
pass through the viewpoint and an edge of the screen window. If objects in the scene extend
beyond these four planes, they must be truncated before pixel data are sent to the screen. These
planes are therefore called clipping planes.
1. Suppose the screen is represented by a rectangle in the 
-plane with vertices 
and 
, and the camera is placed at 
. A line 
in the scene passes
through the points 
and 
. At what points should 
be clipped
by the clipping planes?
2. If the clipped line segment is projected on the screen window, identify the resulting line
segment.
3. Use parametric equations to plot the edges of the screen window, the clipped line segment,
and its projection on the screen window. Then add sight lines connecting the viewpoint to
each end of the clipped segments to verify that the projection is correct.
4. A rectangle with vertices 
, 
, 
, and
is added to the scene. The line 
intersects this rectangle. To make the rect-
angle appear opaque, a programmer can use hidden line rendering, which removes portions
of objects that are behind other objects. Identify the portion of 
that should be removed.

CYLINDERS AND QUADRIC SURFACES
We have already looked at two special types of surfaces: planes (in Section 12.5) and
spheres (in Section 12.1). Here we investigate two other types of surfaces: cylinders and
quadric surfaces.
In order to sketch the graph of a surface, it is useful to determine the curves of intersec-
tion of the surface with planes parallel to the coordinate planes. These curves are called
traces (or cross-sections) of the surface.
12.6

CYLINDERS
A cylinder is a surface that consists of all lines (called rulings) that are parallel to a given
line and pass through a given plane curve.
EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of the surface 
.
SOLUTION Notice that the equation of the graph, 
, doesn’t involve y. This means that
any vertical plane with equation 
(parallel to the 
-plane) intersects the graph in a
curve with equation 
. So these vertical traces are parabolas. Figure 1 shows how
the graph is formed by taking the parabola 
in the 
-plane and moving it in the
direction of the y-axis. The graph is a surface, called a parabolic cylinder, made up of
inﬁnitely many shifted copies of the same parabola. Here the rulings of the cylinder are
parallel to the y-axis.
M
We noticed that the variable y is missing from the equation of the cylinder in Exam-
ple 1. This is typical of a surface whose rulings are parallel to one of the coordinate axes.
If one of the variables x, y, or is missing from the equation of a surface, then the surface
is a cylinder.
EXAMPLE 2 Identify and sketch the surfaces.
(a)
(b)
SOLUTION
(a) Since is missing and the equations 
, 
represent a circle with
radius 1 in the plane 
, the surface 
is a circular cylinder whose axis is
the -axis. (See Figure 2.) Here the rulings are vertical lines.
(b) In this case x is missing and the surface is a circular cylinder whose axis is the x-axis.
(See Figure 3.) It is obtained by taking the circle 
, 
in the 
-plane and
moving it parallel to the x-axis.
M
|
When you are dealing with surfaces, it is important to recognize that an equa-
tion like 
represents a cylinder and not a circle. The trace of the cylinder
in the 
-plane is the circle with equations 
, 
.
QUADRIC SURFACES
A quadric surface is the graph of a second-degree equation in three variables , , and .

Quadric surfaces are the counterparts in three dimensions of the conic sections in the plane.
(See Section 10.5 for a review of conic sections.)
EXAMPLE 3 Use traces to sketch the quadric surface with equation
SOLUTION By substituting 
, we ﬁnd that the trace in the xy-plane is 
,
which we recognize as an equation of an ellipse. In general, the horizontal trace in the
plane 
is
which is an ellipse, provided that 
, that is, 
.
Similarly, the vertical traces are also ellipses:
Figure 4 shows how drawing some traces indicates the shape of the surface. It’s called an
ellipsoid because all of its traces are ellipses. Notice that it is symmetric with respect to
each coordinate plane; this is a reﬂection of the fact that its equation involves only even
powers of x, y, and .
M
EXAMPLE 4 Use traces to sketch the surface 
.
SOLUTION If we put 
, we get 
, so the 
-plane intersects the surface in a
parabola. If we put 
(a constant), we get 
. This means that if we 
slice the graph with any plane parallel to the 
-plane, we obtain a parabola that opens
upward. Similarly, if 
, the trace is 
, which is again a parabola that
opens upward. If we put 
, we get the horizontal traces 
, which we
recognize as a family of ellipses. Knowing the shapes of the traces, we can sketch the
graph in Figure 5. Because of the elliptical and parabolic traces, the quadric surface
is called an elliptic paraboloid.

that of a saddle. This surface will be investigated further in Section 14.7 when we dis-
cuss saddle points.

This surface is called a hyperboloid of one sheet and is sketched in Figure 9.
M
The idea of using traces to draw a surface is employed in three-dimensional graphing
software for computers. In most such software, traces in the vertical planes 
and
are drawn for equally spaced values of , and parts of the graph are eliminated using
hidden line removal. Table 1 shows computer-drawn graphs of the six basic types of
quadric surfaces in standard form. All surfaces are symmetric with respect to the -axis. If
a quadric surface is symmetric about a different axis, its equation changes accordingly.

TABLE 1 Graphs of quadric surfaces

EXAMPLE 7 Identify and sketch the surface 
.
SOLUTION Dividing by 
, we ﬁrst put the equation in standard form:
Comparing this equation with Table 1, we see that it represents a hyperboloid of two
sheets, the only difference being that in this case the axis of the hyperboloid is the 
-axis. The traces in the 
- and 
-planes are the hyperbolas
The surface has no trace in the 
-plane, but traces in the vertical planes 
for
are the ellipses
which can be written as
These traces are used to make the sketch in Figure 10.

EXAMPLE 8 Classify the quadric surface 
.
SOLUTION By completing the square we rewrite the equation as
Comparing this equation with Table 1, we see that it represents an elliptic paraboloid.
Here, however, the axis of the paraboloid is parallel to the -axis, and it has been shifted
so that its vertex is the point 
. The traces in the plane 
are the
ellipses
The trace in the 
-plane is the parabola with equation 
, 
. The
paraboloid is sketched in Figure 11.

APPLICATIONS OF QUADRIC SURFACES
Examples of quadric surfaces can be found in the world around us. In fact, the world itself
is a good example. Although the earth is commonly modeled as a sphere, a more accurate
model is an ellipsoid because the earth’s rotation has caused a ﬂattening at the poles. (See
Exercise 47.)
Circular paraboloids, obtained by rotating a parabola about its axis, are used to collect
and reﬂect light, sound, and radio and television signals. In a radio telescope, for instance,
signals from distant stars that strike the bowl are reﬂected to the receiver at the focus and
are therefore ampliﬁed. (The idea is explained in Problem 18 on page 268.) The same prin-
ciple applies to microphones and satellite dishes in the shape of paraboloids.
Cooling towers for nuclear reactors are usually designed in the shape of hyperboloids
of one sheet for reasons of structural stability. Pairs of hyperboloids are used to transmit
rotational motion between skew axes. (The cogs of gears are the generating lines of the
hyperboloids. See Exercise 49.)

VECTOR 
FUNCTIONS
13
The functions that we have been using so far have been real-valued functions. We now
study functions whose values are vectors because such functions are needed to describe
curves and surfaces in space. We will also use vector-valued functions to describe the
motion of objects through space. In particular, we will use them to derive Kepler’s laws
of planetary motion.
Tangent vectors show the direction in 
which a space curve proceeds at any point.

VECTOR FUNCTIONS AND SPACE CURVES
In general, a function is a rule that assigns to each element in the domain an element in the
range. A vector-valued function, or vector function, is simply a function whose domain
is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. We are most interested in vec-
tor functions whose values are three-dimensional vectors. This means that for every num-
ber in the domain of there is a unique vector in 
denoted by 
. If 
, 
, and 
are the components of the vector 
, then , , and are real-valued functions called the
component functions of and we can write
We usually use the letter to denote the independent variable because it represents time in
most applications of vector functions.
EXAMPLE 1 If
then the component functions are
By our usual convention, the domain of consists of all values of for which the expres-
sion for 
is deﬁned. The expressions , 
, and 
are all deﬁned when
and 
. Therefore the domain of is the interval 
.
M
The limit of a vector function is deﬁned by taking the limits of its component func-
tions as follows.
If 
, then
provided the limits of the component functions exist.
Equivalently, we could have used an 
deﬁnition (see Exercise 45). Limits of vector
functions obey the same rules as limits of real-valued functions (see Exercise 43).
EXAMPLE 2 Find 
, where 
.
SOLUTION According to Deﬁnition 1, the limit of r is the vector whose components are the
limits of the component functions of r:

A vector function is continuous at a if
In view of Deﬁnition 1, we see that is continuous at if and only if its component func-
tions , , and 
are continuous at .
There is a close connection between continuous vector functions and space curves.
Suppose that , , and are continuous real-valued functions on an interval . Then the set
of all points 
in space, where
and 
varies throughout the interval , is called a space curve. The equations in (2) are
called parametric equations of C and is called a parameter. We can think of 
as being
traced out by a moving particle whose position at time is 
. If we now con-
sider the vector function 
, then 
is the position vector of the
point 
on . Thus any continuous vector function deﬁnes a space curve
that is traced out by the tip of the moving vector 
, as shown in Figure 1.
EXAMPLE 3 Describe the curve deﬁned by the vector function
SOLUTION The corresponding parametric equations are
which we recognize from Equations 12.5.2 as parametric equations of a line passing
through the point 
and parallel to the vector 
. Alternatively, we could
observe that the function can be written as 
, where 
and
, and this is the vector equation of a line as given by Equation 12.5.1.
M
Plane curves can also be represented in vector notation. For instance, the curve given
by the parametric equations 
and 
(see Example 1 in Section 10.1)
could also be described by the vector equation
where 
and 
.
EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the curve whose vector equation is
SOLUTION The parametric equations for this curve are
Since 
, the curve must lie on the circular cylinder
. The point 
lies directly above the point 
, which moves 
counterclockwise around the circle 
in the xy-plane. (See Example 2 in
Section 10.1.) Since 
, the curve spirals upward around the cylinder as increases.
The curve, shown in Figure 2, is called a helix.

The corkscrew shape of the helix in Example 4 is familiar from its occurrence in coiled
springs. It also occurs in the model of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic material
of living cells). In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the structure of the
DNA molecule is that of two linked, parallel helixes that are intertwined as in Figure 3.
In Examples 3 and 4 we were given vector equations of curves and asked for a geo-
metric description or sketch. In the next two examples we are given a geometric descrip-
tion of a curve and are asked to ﬁnd parametric equations for the curve.
EXAMPLE 5 Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line segment that
joins the point 
to the point 
.
SOLUTION In Section 12.5 we found a vector equation for the line segment that joins the tip
of the vector 
to the tip of the vector :
(See Equation 12.5.4.) Here we take 
and

vector equation of the line segment from

The projection of C onto the xy-plane is the circle 
. So we know
from Example 2 in Section 10.1 that we can write
From the equation of the plane, we have
So we can write parametric equations for C as
The corresponding vector equation is
This equation is called a parametrization of the curve C. The arrows in Figure 6 indicate
the direction in which C is traced as the parameter t increases.
M
USING COMPUTERS TO DRAW SPACE CURVES
Space curves are inherently more difﬁcult to draw by hand than plane curves; for an accu-
rate representation we need to use technology. For instance, Figure 7 shows a computer-
generated graph of the curve with parametric equations
It’s called a toroidal spiral because it lies on a torus. Another interesting curve, the tre-
foil knot, with equations
is graphed in Figure 8. It wouldn’t be easy to plot either of these curves by hand.
Even when a computer is used to draw a space curve, optical illusions make it difﬁcult
to get a good impression of what the curve really looks like. (This is especially true in
Figure 8. See Exercise 44.) The next example shows how to cope with this problem.
EXAMPLE 7 Use a computer to draw the curve with vector equation 
This curve is called a twisted cubic.
SOLUTION We start by using the computer to plot the curve with parametric equations
, 
, 
for 
. The result is shown in Figure 9(a), but it’s hard to
see the true nature of the curve from that graph alone. Most three-dimensional computer
graphing programs allow the user to enclose a curve or surface in a box instead of dis-
playing the coordinate axes. When we look at the same curve in a box in Figure 9(b), we
have a much clearer picture of the curve. We can see that it climbs from a lower corner
of the box to the upper corner nearest us, and it twists as it climbs.

We get an even better idea of the curve when we view it from different vantage
points. Part (c) shows the result of rotating the box to give another viewpoint. Parts (d),
(e), and (f) show the views we get when we look directly at a face of the box. In par-
ticular, part (d) shows the view from directly above the box. It is the projection of the
curve on the 
-plane, namely, the parabola 
. Part (e) shows the projection on 
the 
-plane, the cubic curve 
. It’s now obvious why the given curve is called a
twisted cubic.
M
Another method of visualizing a space curve is to draw it on a surface. For instance, the
twisted cubic in Example 7 lies on the parabolic cylinder 
. (Eliminate the parame-
ter from the ﬁrst two parametric equations, 
and 
.) Figure 10 shows both the
cylinder and the twisted cubic, and we see that the curve moves upward from the origin
along the surface of the cylinder. We also used this method in Example 4 to visualize the
helix lying on the circular cylinder (see Figure 2).
A third method for visualizing the twisted cubic is to realize that it also lies on the cylin-
der 
. So it can be viewed as the curve of intersection of the cylinders 
and
. (See Figure 11.)

We have seen that an interesting space curve, the helix, occurs in the model of DNA.
Another notable example of a space curve in science is the trajectory of a positively
charged particle in orthogonally oriented electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B. Depending
on the initial velocity given the particle at the origin, the path of the particle is either a
space curve whose projection on the horizontal plane is the cycloid we studied in Section
10.1 [Figure 12(a)] or a curve whose projection is the trochoid investigated in Exercise 40
in Section 10.1 [Figure 12(b)].

the particles, see the following websites:

with a clearer picture of a space curve by enclos-
ing it in a tube. Such a plot enables us to see
whether one part of a curve passes in front of or
behind another part of the curve. For example,

it’s often important to know whether they will collide. (Will a
missile hit its moving target? Will two aircraft collide?) The
curves might intersect, but we need to know whether the
objects are in the same position at the same time. Suppose the
trajectories of two particles are given by the vector functions

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR FUNCTIONS
DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS OF VECTOR FUNCTIONS
Later in this chapter we are going to use vector functions to describe the motion of plan-
ets and other objects through space. Here we prepare the way by developing the calculus
of vector functions.
DERIVATIVES
The derivative 
of a vector function 
is deﬁned in much the same way as for real-
valued functions:
if this limit exists. The geometric signiﬁcance of this deﬁnition is shown in Figure 1. If the
points 
and 
have position vectors 
and 
, then PQ
l represents the vector
, which can therefore be regarded as a secant vector. If 
, the scalar
multiple 
has the same direction as 
. As 
, it
appears that this vector approaches a vector that lies on the tangent line. For this reason,
the vector 
is called the tangent vector to the curve deﬁned by 
at the point , pro-
vided that 
exists and 
. The tangent line to 
at 
is deﬁned to be the line
through 
parallel to the tangent vector 
. We will also have occasion to consider the
unit tangent vector, which is
The following theorem gives us a convenient method for computing the derivative of a
vector function : just differentiate each component of .

ARC LENGTH AND CURVATURE
In Section 10.2 we deﬁned the length of a plane curve with parametric equations
,
, 
, as the limit of lengths of inscribed polygons and, for the case where
and 
are continuous, we arrived at the formula
The length of a space curve is deﬁned in exactly the same way (see Figure 1). Suppose
that the curve has the vector equation 
, 
, or, equivalently,
the parametric equations 
, 
, 
, where , 
, and 
are continuous.
If the curve is traversed exactly once as
increases from 
to , then it can be shown that
its length is
Notice that both of the arc length formulas (1) and (2) can be put into the more com-
pact form
because, for plane curves 
,
and for space curves 
,
EXAMPLE 1 Find the length of the arc of the circular helix with vector equation
from the point 
to the point 
.
SOLUTION Since 
, we have
The arc from 
to 
is described by the parameter interval 
and so, from Formula 3, we have

could also be represented by the function
where the connection between the parameters 
and 
is given by 
. We say that
Equations 4 and 5 are parametrizations of the curve . If we were to use Equation 3 to
compute the length of 
using Equations 4 and 5, we would get the same answer. In gen-
eral, it can be shown that when Equation 3 is used to compute arc length, the answer is
independent of the parametrization that is used.
Now we suppose that 
is a curve given by a vector function
where 
is continuous and 
is traversed exactly once as increases from to . We deﬁne
its arc length function
by
Thus 
is the length of the part of 
between 
and 
. (See Figure 3.) If we differ-
entiate both sides of Equation 6 using Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we
obtain
It is often useful to parametrize a curve with respect to arc length because arc length
arises naturally from the shape of the curve and does not depend on a particular coordinate
system. If a curve 
is already given in terms of a parameter and 
is the arc length
function given by Equation 6, then we may be able to solve for as a function of :
Then the curve can be reparametrized in terms of by substituting for : 
. Thus,
if 
for instance, 
is the position vector of the point 3 units of length along the
curve from its starting point.
EXAMPLE 2 Reparametrize the helix 
with respect to arc
length measured from 
in the direction of increasing .
SOLUTION The initial point 
corresponds to the parameter value 
. From 
Example 1 we have
and so
Therefore 
and the required reparametrization is obtained by substituting for :
M
CURVATURE
A parametrization 
is called smooth on an interval if 
is continuous and 
on . A curve is called smooth if it has a smooth parametrization. A smooth curve has no
sharp corners or cusps; when the tangent vector turns, it does so continuously.

If 
is a smooth curve deﬁned by the vector function , recall that the unit tangent vec-
tor 
is given by
and indicates the direction of the curve. From Figure 4 you can see that 
changes direc-
tion very slowly when 
is fairly straight, but it changes direction more quickly when 
bends or twists more sharply.
The curvature of 
at a given point is a measure of how quickly the curve changes direc-
tion at that point. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne it to be the magnitude of the rate of change of the
unit tangent vector with respect to arc length. (We use arc length so that the curvature will
be independent of the parametrization.)
DEFINITION The curvature of a curve is
where 
is the unit tangent vector.
The curvature is easier to compute if it is expressed in terms of the parameter instead
of , so we use the Chain Rule (Theorem 13.2.3, Formula 6) to write
But 
from Equation 7, so
EXAMPLE 3 Show that the curvature of a circle of radius is 
.
SOLUTION We can take the circle to have center the origin, and then a parametrization is
Therefore
so
and
This gives 
, so using Equation 9, we have
M
The result of Example 3 shows that small circles have large curvature and large circles
have small curvature, in accordance with our intuition. We can see directly from the deﬁ-

THE NORMAL AND BINORMAL VECTORS
At a given point on a smooth space curve 
, there are many vectors that are orthogonal
to the unit tangent vector 
. We single out one by observing that, because 
for all , we have 
by Example 4 in Section 13.2, so 
is orthogonal to
. Note that 
is itself not a unit vector. But if 
is also smooth, we can deﬁne the
principal unit normal vector
(or simply unit normal) as
The vector 
is called the binormal vector. It is perpendicular to both 
and 
and is also a unit vector. (See Figure 6.)

The plane determined by the normal and binormal vectors 
and 
at a point 
on a
curve 
is called the normal plane of 
at . It consists of all lines that are orthogonal 
to the tangent vector . The plane determined by the vectors 
and 
is called the oscu-
lating plane of 
at . The name comes from the Latin osculum, meaning “kiss.” It is the
plane that comes closest to containing the part of the curve near . (For a plane curve, the
osculating plane is simply the plane that contains the curve.)
The circle that lies in the osculating plane of 
at , has the same tangent as 
at , lies
on the concave side of 
(toward which 
points), and has radius 
(the reciprocal
of the curvature) is called the osculating circle (or the circle of curvature) of 
at . It is
the circle that best describes how 
behaves near ; it shares the same tangent, normal,
and curvature at .
EXAMPLE 7 Find the equations of the normal plane and osculating plane of the helix
in Example 6 at the point 
.
SOLUTION The normal plane at 
has normal vector 
, so an equation
is
The osculating plane at

and , so its normal vector is

A simpler normal vector is

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR FUNCTIONS
MOTION IN SPACE: VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION
In this section we show how the ideas of tangent and normal vectors and curvature can be
used in physics to study the motion of an object, including its velocity and acceleration,
along a space curve. In particular, we follow in the footsteps of Newton by using these
methods to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion.
Suppose a particle moves through space so that its position vector at time 
is 
.
Notice from Figure 1 that, for small values of , the vector
approximates the direction of the particle moving along the curve 
. Its magnitude mea-
sures the size of the displacement vector per unit time. The vector (1) gives the average

velocity over a time interval of length 
and its limit is the velocity vector
at time :
Thus the velocity vector is also the tangent vector and points in the direction of the tangent
line.
The speed of the particle at time is the magnitude of the velocity vector, that is,
.
This is appropriate because, from (2) and from Equation 13.3.7, we have
As in the case of one-dimensional motion, the acceleration of the particle is deﬁned as the
derivative of the velocity:
EXAMPLE 1 The position vector of an object moving in a plane is given by

EXAMPLE 3 A moving particle starts at an initial position

velocity

Putting 
, we ﬁnd that

M
In general, vector integrals allow us to recover velocity when acceleration is known and
position when velocity is known:
If the force that acts on a particle is known, then the acceleration can be found from
Newton’s Second Law of Motion. The vector version of this law states that if, at any time
, a force 
acts on an object of mass 
producing an acceleration 
, then
EXAMPLE 4 An object with mass 
that moves in a circular path with constant angular
speed 
has position vector 
. Find the force acting on the
object and show that it is directed toward the origin.
SOLUTION To ﬁnd the force, we ﬁrst need to know the acceleration:

SOLUTION We set up the axes so that the projectile starts at the origin. Since the force due

Since

Integrating again, we obtain
But

If we write

TANGENTIAL AND NORMAL COMPONENTS OF ACCELERATION
When we study the motion of a particle, it is often useful to resolve the acceleration into
two components, one in the direction of the tangent and the other in the direction of the
normal. If we write 
for the speed of the particle, then
and so
If we differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to , we get
If we use the expression for the curvature given by Equation 13.3.9, then we have
The unit normal vector was deﬁned in the preceding section as

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR FUNCTIONS

Writing 
and 
for the tangential and normal components of acceleration, we have
where
This resolution is illustrated in Figure 7.
Let’s look at what Formula 7 says. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that the binormal vector
B is absent. No matter how an object moves through space, its acceleration always lies in
the plane of T and N (the osculating plane). (Recall that T gives the direction of motion
and N points in the direction the curve is turning.) Next we notice that the tangential com-
ponent of acceleration is , the rate of change of speed, and the normal component of
acceleration is 
, the curvature times the square of the speed. This makes sense if we
think of a passenger in a car—a sharp turn in a road means a large value of the curvature
, so the component of the acceleration perpendicular to the motion is large and the pas-
senger is thrown against a car door. High speed around the turn has the same effect; in fact,
if you double your speed, 
is increased by a factor of 4.
Although we have expressions for the tangential and normal components of accelera-
tion in Equations 8, it’s desirable to have expressions that depend only on , , and 
. To
this end we take the dot product of 
with as given by Equation 7:
(since 
and 
)
Therefore

KEPLER’S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION
We now describe one of the great accomplishments of calculus by showing how the mate-
rial of this chapter can be used to prove Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. After 20 years
of studying the astronomical observations of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, the
German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) formulated the fol-
lowing three laws.
KEPLER’S LAWS
1. A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one 
focus.
2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of
the length of the major axis of its orbit.
In his book Principia Mathematica of 1687, Sir Isaac Newton was able to show that
these three laws are consequences of two of his own laws, the Second Law of Motion and
the Law of Universal Gravitation. In what follows we prove Kepler’s First Law. The 
remaining laws are proved as exercises (with hints).
Since the gravitational force of the sun on a planet is so much larger than the forces
exerted by other celestial bodies, we can safely ignore all bodies in the universe except the
sun and one planet revolving about it. We use a coordinate system with the sun at the ori-
gin and we let 
be the position vector of the planet. (Equally well, could be the
position vector of the moon or a satellite moving around the earth or a comet moving
around a star.) The velocity vector is 
and the acceleration vector is 
. We use
the following laws of Newton:
where 
is the gravitational force on the planet, 
and 
are the masses of the planet and
the sun, 
is the gravitational constant, 
, and 
is the unit vector in the
direction of .
We ﬁrst show that the planet moves in one plane. By equating the expressions for 
in
Newton’s two laws, we ﬁnd that

and so 
is parallel to . It follows that 
. We use Formula 5 in Theorem 13.2.3
to write
Therefore
where is a constant vector. (We may assume that 
; that is, and are not parallel.)
This means that the vector 
is perpendicular to 
for all values of t, so the planet
always lies in the plane through the origin perpendicular to . Thus the orbit of the planet
is a plane curve.
To prove Kepler’s First Law we rewrite the vector 
as follows:
Then
(by Theorem 12.4.8, Property 6)
But 
and, since 
, it follows from Example 4 in Section 13.2 that
. Therefore
and so
Integrating both sides of this equation, we get
where is a constant vector.
At this point it is convenient to choose the coordinate axes so that the standard basis
vector 
points in the direction of the vector . Then the planet moves in the 
-plane.
Since both 
and 
are perpendicular to , Equation 11 shows that 
lies in the 
-plane. This means that we can choose the - and -axes so that the vector lies in the
direction of , as shown in Figure 8.
If

are polar coordinates of the planet. From

where 
. So
Writing 
, we obtain the equation
Comparing with Theorem 10.6.6, we see that Equation 12 is the polar equation of a conic
section with focus at the origin and eccentricity . We know that the orbit of a planet is a
closed curve and so the conic must be an ellipse.
This completes the derivation of Kepler’s First Law. We will guide you through the der-
ivation of the Second and Third Laws in the Applied Project on page 848. The proofs of
these three laws show that the methods of this chapter provide a powerful tool for describ-
ing some of the laws of nature.

words, does the ball clear the fence?)
29. A medieval city has the shape of a square and is protected 
by walls with length 500 m and height 15 m. You are the
commander of an attacking army and the closest you can get
to the wall is 100 m. Your plan is to set ﬁre to the city by cat-
apulting heated rocks over the wall (with an initial speed of
). At what range of angles should you tell your men to
set the catapult? (Assume the path of the rocks is perpendicu-
lar to the wall.)
30. A ball with mass 0.8 kg is thrown southward into the air with
a speed of 
at an angle of 
to the ground. A west
wind applies a steady force of 4 N to the ball in an easterly
direction. Where does the ball land and with what speed?
; 31. Water traveling along a straight portion of a river normally
ﬂows fastest in the middle, and the speed slows to almost
zero at the banks. Consider a long straight stretch of river
ﬂowing north, with parallel banks 40 m apart. If the maxi-
mum water speed is 3 
, we can use a quadratic function
as a basic model for the rate of water ﬂow units from the
west bank: 
.
(a) A boat proceeds at a constant speed of 
from a point
on the west bank while maintaining a heading perpen-
dicular to the bank. How far down the river on the oppo-
site bank will the boat touch shore? Graph the path of the
boat.
(b) Suppose we would like to pilot the boat to land at the
point 
on the east bank directly opposite . If we main-
tain a constant speed of 
and a constant heading,
ﬁnd the angle at which the boat should head. Then graph
the actual path the boat follows. Does the path seem 
realistic?
32. Another reasonable model for the water speed of the river in
Exercise 31 is a sine function: 
. If a
boater would like to cross the river from 
to 
with con-
stant heading and a constant speed of 
, determine the
angle at which the boat should head.

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR FUNCTIONS
Johannes Kepler stated the following three laws of planetary motion on the basis of masses of
data on the positions of the planets at various times.
KEPLER’S LAWS
1. A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus.
2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the length
of the major axis of its orbit.
Kepler formulated these laws because they ﬁtted the astronomical data. He wasn’t able to see 
why they were true or how they related to each other. But Sir Isaac Newton, in his Principia 
Mathematica of 1687, showed how to deduce Kepler’s three laws from two of Newton’s own 
laws, the Second Law of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In Section 13.4 we 
proved Kepler’s First Law using the calculus of vector functions. In this project we guide you
through the proofs of Kepler’s Second and Third Laws and explore some of their consequences.
1. Use the following steps to prove Kepler’s Second Law. The notation is the same as in 
the proof of the First Law in Section 13.4. In particular, use polar coordinates so that
.
(a) Show that 
.
(b) Deduce that 
.
(c) If

(d) Deduce that
This says that the rate at which 
is swept out is constant and proves Kepler’s Second
Law.
2. Let 
be the period of a planet about the sun; that is, 
is the time required for it to travel once
around its elliptical orbit. Suppose that the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse
are 
and 
.
(a) Use part (d) of Problem 1 to show that 
.
(b) Show that 
.
(c) Use parts (a) and (b) to show that 
.
This proves Kepler’s Third Law. [Notice that the proportionality constant 
is 
independent of the planet.]
3. The period of the earth’s orbit is approximately 365.25 days. Use this fact and Kepler’s 
Third Law to ﬁnd the length of the major axis of the earth’s orbit. You will need the mass of
the sun, 
kg, and the gravitational constant, 
kg .
4. It’s possible to place a satellite into orbit about the earth so that it remains ﬁxed above a 
given location on the equator. Compute the altitude that is needed for such a satellite. The
earth’s mass is 
; its radius is 
. (This orbit is called the Clarke
Geosynchronous Orbit after Arthur C. Clarke, who ﬁrst proposed the idea in 1945. The ﬁrst
such satellite, Syncom 2, was launched in July 1963.)

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR FUNCTIONS

(c) Determine the Coriolis acceleration of a particle that moves
on a rotating disk according to the equation
22. In designing transfer curves to connect sections of straight rail-
road tracks, it’s important to realize that the acceleration of the
train should be continuous so that the reactive force exerted by
the train on the track is also continuous. Because of the formu-
las for the components of acceleration in Section 13.4, this will
be the case if the curvature varies continuously.
(a) A logical candidate for a transfer curve to join existing
tracks given by 
for 
and 
for 
might be the function 
,
, whose graph is the arc of the circle shown
in the ﬁgure. It looks reasonable at ﬁrst glance. Show that
the function
is continuous and has continuous slope, but does not have
continuous curvature. Therefore 
is not an appropriate
transfer curve.
;
(b) Find a ﬁfth-degree polynomial to serve as a transfer curve
between the following straight line segments: 
for
and 
for 
. Could this be done with a
fourth-degree polynomial? Use a graphing calculator or
computer to sketch the graph of the “connected” function
and check to see that it looks like the one in the ﬁgure.

2. A circular curve of radius 
on a highway is banked at an angle
so that a car can safely
traverse the curve without skidding when there is no friction between the road and the tires.
The loss of friction could occur, for example, if the road is covered with a ﬁlm of water or ice.
The rated speed 
of the curve is the maximum speed that a car can attain without skidding.
Suppose a car of mass 
is traversing the curve at the rated speed 
Two forces are acting on
the car: the vertical force, 
, due to the weight of the car, and a force 
exerted by, and
normal to, the road. (See the ﬁgure.)
The vertical component of 
balances the weight of the car, so that 
. The
horizontal component of

ond Law and part (d) of Problem 1,

, but wish to increase the
rated speed by 
. What should the radius of the curve be?
3. A projectile is ﬁred from the origin with angle of elevation 
and initial speed . Assuming
that air resistance is negligible and that the only force acting on the projectile is gravity, , we
showed in Example 5 in Section 13.4 that the position vector of the projectile is
We also showed that the maximum horizontal distance of the projectile is achieved when
and in this case the range is 
.
(a) At what angle should the projectile be ﬁred to achieve maximum height and what is the
maximum height?
(b) Fix the initial speed 
and consider the parabola 
, whose graph is
shown in the ﬁgure. Show that the projectile can hit any target inside or on the boundary
of the region bounded by the parabola and the -axis, and that it can’t hit any target out-
side this region.
(c) Suppose that the gun is elevated to an angle of inclination 
in order to aim at a target that
is suspended at a height 
directly over a point 
units downrange. The target is released
at the instant the gun is ﬁred. Show that the projectile always hits the target, regardless of
the value , provided the projectile does not hit the ground “before” .

4. (a) A projectile is ﬁred from the origin down an inclined plane that makes an angle 
with the
horizontal. The angle of elevation of the gun and the initial speed of the projectile are 
and , respectively. Find the position vector of the projectile and the parametric equations
of the path of the projectile as functions of the time . (Ignore air resistance.)
(b) Show that the angle of elevation 
that will maximize the downhill range is the angle
halfway between the plane and the vertical.
(c) Suppose the projectile is ﬁred up an inclined plane whose angle of inclination is . Show
that, in order to maximize the (uphill) range, the projectile should be ﬁred in the direction
halfway between the plane and the vertical.
(d) In a paper presented in 1686, Edmond Halley summarized the laws of gravity and projectile
motion and applied them to gunnery. One problem he posed involved ﬁring a projectile to
hit a target a distance 
up an inclined plane. Show that the angle at which the projectile
should be ﬁred to hit the target but use the least amount of energy is the same as the angle
in part (c). (Use the fact that the energy needed to ﬁre the projectile is proportional to the
square of the initial speed, so minimizing the energy is equivalent to minimizing the initial
speed.)
5. A ball rolls off a table with a speed of 2 fts. The table is 3.5 ft high.
(a) Determine the point at which the ball hits the ﬂoor and ﬁnd its speed at the instant of
impact.
(b) Find the angle 
between the path of the ball and the vertical line drawn through the point
of impact. (See the ﬁgure.)
(c) Suppose the ball rebounds from the ﬂoor at the same angle with which it hits the ﬂoor, but
loses 
of its speed due to energy absorbed by the ball on impact. Where does the ball
strike the ﬂoor on the second bounce?
6. Find the curvature of the curve with parametric equations
; 7. If a projectile is ﬁred with angle of elevation 
and initial speed , then parametric equations
for its trajectory are
(See Example 5 in Section 13.4.) We know that the range (horizontal distance traveled) 
is maximized when 
. What value of

projectile? (State your answer correct to the nearest degree.)

So far we have dealt with the calculus of functions of a single variable. But, in the real
world, physical quantities often depend on two or more variables, so in this chapter 
we turn our attention to functions of several variables and extend the basic ideas of
differential calculus to such functions.
Functions of two variables can be visualized by means of level curves, which con-
nect points where the function takes on a given value. Atmospheric pressure at a
given time is a function of longitude and latitude and is measured in millibars. Here
the level curves are called isobars and those pictured join locations that had the
same pressure on March 7, 2007. (The curves labeled 1028, for instance, connect
points with pressure 1028 mb.) Surface winds tend to ﬂow from areas of high
pressure across the isobars toward areas of low pressure, and are strongest
where the isobars are tightly packed.

FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
In this section we study functions of two or more variables from four points of view:
N verbally
(by a description in words)
N numerically
(by a table of values)
N algebraically
(by an explicit formula)
N visually
(by a graph or level curves)
FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES
The temperature 
at a point on the surface of the earth at any given time depends on the
longitude 
and latitude 
of the point. We can think of 
as being a function of the two
variables and , or as a function of the pair 
. We indicate this functional dependence
by writing 
.
The volume 
of a circular cylinder depends on its radius and its height . In fact, we
know that
. We say that
is a function of
and , and we write
.
DEFINITION A function
of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered
pair of real numbers 
in a set 
a unique real number denoted by 
. The
set 
is the domain of 
and its range is the set of values that 
takes on, that is,
.
We often write 
to make explicit the value taken on by 
at the general point
. The variables and are independent variables and is the dependent variable.
[Compare this with the notation 
for functions of a single variable.]
A function of two variables is just a function whose domain is a subset of 
and whose
range is a subset of . One way of visualizing such a function is by means of an arrow dia-
gram (see Figure 1), where the domain 
is represented as a subset of the 
-plane.
If a function 
is given by a formula and no domain is speciﬁed, then the domain of 
is understood to be the set of all pairs 
for which the given expression is a well-
deﬁned real number.

square root sign is nonnegative. So the domain of

The inequality

the line

means that the points on the line

excluded from the domain. (See Figure 2.)

Not all functions are given by explicit formulas. The function in the next example is
described verbally and by numerical estimates of its values.
EXAMPLE 2 In regions with severe winter weather, the wind-chill index is often used to
describe the apparent severity of the cold. This index W is a subjective temperature that
depends on the actual temperature T and the wind speed . So W is a function of T and ,
and we can write 
. Table 1 records values of W compiled by the NOAA
National Weather Service of the US and the Meteorological Service of Canada.
For instance, the table shows that if the temperature is 
and the wind speed is
50 kmh, then subjectively it would feel as cold as a temperature of about 
with
no wind. So

TABLE 1
Wind-chill index as a function of 
air temperature and wind speed
N THE NEW WIND-CHILL INDEX
A new wind-chill index was introduced in
November of 2001 and is more accurate than the
old index at measuring how cold it feels when
it’s windy. The new index is based on a model of
how fast a human face loses heat. It was devel-
oped through clinical trials in which volunteers
were exposed to a variety of temperatures and
wind speeds in a refrigerated wind tunnel.

sidered a simpliﬁed view of the economy in which production output is determined by
the amount of labor involved and the amount of capital invested. While there are many
other factors affecting economic performance, their model proved to be remarkably
accurate. The function they used to model production was of the form
where P is the total production (the monetary value of all goods produced in a year), 
L is the amount of labor (the total number of person-hours worked in a year), and K is
the amount of capital invested (the monetary worth of all machinery, equipment, and
buildings). In Section 14.3 we will show how the form of Equation 1 follows from cer-
tain economic assumptions.
Cobb and Douglas used economic data published by the government to obtain
Table 2. They took the year 1899 as a baseline, and P, L, and K for 1899 were each
assigned the value 100. The values for other years were expressed as percentages of 
the 1899 ﬁgures.
Cobb and Douglas used the method of least squares to ﬁt the data of Table 2 to the
function
(See Exercise 75 for the details.)
If we use the model given by the function in Equation 2 to compute the production in
the years 1910 and 1920, we get the values
which are quite close to the actual values, 159 and 231.
The production function (1) has subsequently been used in many settings, ranging
from individual ﬁrms to global economic questions. It has become known as the 
Cobb-Douglas production function. Its domain is 
because 
L and K represent labor and capital and are therefore never negative.

GRAPHS
Another way of visualizing the behavior of a function of two variables is to consider its
graph.
DEFINITION If
is a function of two variables with domain D, then the graph of
is the set of all points 
in 
such that 
and 
is in D.
Just as the graph of a function 
of one variable is a curve 
with equation 
so
the graph of a function 
of two variables is a surface with equation 
. We can
visualize the graph 
of 
as lying directly above or below its domain 
in the 
-plane.
(See Figure 5.)
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION The graph of 
has the equation 
, or 
, which
represents a plane. To graph the plane we ﬁrst ﬁnd the intercepts. Putting 
in
the equation, we get 
as the -intercept. Similarly, the -intercept is 3 and the 
-intercept is 6. This helps us sketch the portion of the graph that lies in the ﬁrst octant.
(See Figure 6.)
M
The function in Example 5 is a special case of the function
which is called a linear function. The graph of such a function has the equation
or
so it is a plane. In much the same way that linear functions of one variable are important
in single-variable calculus, we will see that linear functions of two variables play a central
role in multivariable calculus.
EXAMPLE 6 Sketch the graph of 
.
SOLUTION The graph has equation 
. We square both sides of this equa-
tion to obtain 
, or 
, which we recognize as an equa-
tion of the sphere with center the origin and radius 3. But, since 
, the graph of is
just the top half of this sphere (see Figure 7).

An entire sphere can’t be represented by a single function of and . As we saw
in Example 6, the upper hemisphere of the sphere 
is represented by the
function 
. The lower hemisphere is represented by the function
.
EXAMPLE 7 Use a computer to draw the graph of the Cobb-Douglas production function
.
SOLUTION Figure 8 shows the graph of P for values of the labor L and capital K that lie
between 0 and 300. The computer has drawn the surface by plotting vertical traces. 
We see from these traces that the value of the production P increases as either L or K
increases, as is to be expected.

EXAMPLE 8 Find the domain and range and sketch the graph of

SOLUTION Notice that

,
so the domain is 
, the entire xy-plane. The range of h is the set 
of all nonnega-
tive real numbers. [Notice that 
and 
, so 
for all x and y.]
The graph of h has the equation 
, which is the elliptic paraboloid that
we sketched in Example 4 in Section 12.6. Horizontal traces are ellipses and vertical
traces are parabolas (see Figure 9).
M
Computer programs are readily available for graphing functions of two variables. In
most such programs, traces in the vertical planes 
and 
are drawn for equally
spaced values of and parts of the graph are eliminated using hidden line removal.

Figure 10 shows computer-generated graphs of several functions. Notice that we get an
especially good picture of a function when rotation is used to give views from different
vantage points. In parts (a) and (b) the graph of 
is very ﬂat and close to the 
-plane
except near the origin; this is because 
is very small when or is large.
LEVEL CURVES
So far we have two methods for visualizing functions: arrow diagrams and graphs. A third
method, borrowed from mapmakers, is a contour map on which points of constant eleva-
tion are joined to form contour curves, or level curves.
DEFINITION The level curves of a function 
of two variables are the curves with
equations 
, where is a constant (in the range of ).
A level curve 
is the set of all points in the domain of 
at which 
takes on
a given value . In other words, it shows where the graph of 
has height .
You can see from Figure 11 the relation between level curves and horizontal traces. The
level curves 
are just the traces of the graph of 
in the horizontal plane 
projected down to the 
-plane. So if you draw the level curves of a function and visual-
ize them being lifted up to the surface at the indicated height, then you can mentally piece

together a picture of the graph. The surface is steep where the level curves are close 
together. It is somewhat ﬂatter where they are farther apart.
One common example of level curves occurs in topographic maps of mountainous
regions, such as the map in Figure 12. The level curves are curves of constant elevation
above sea level. If you walk along one of these contour lines, you neither ascend nor descend.
Another common example is the temperature function introduced in the opening paragraph
of this section. Here the level curves are called isothermals and join locations with the
same temperature. Figure 13 shows a weather map of the world indicating the average
January temperatures. The isothermals are the curves that separate the colored bands. The
isobars in the atmospheric pressure map on page 854 provide another example of level
curves.

shows a contour map of h drawn by a computer with level curves corresponding to

of h (an elliptic paraboloid) where they become horizontal traces. We see from Figure 17
how the graph of h is put together from the level curves.

EXAMPLE 13 Plot level curves for the Cobb-Douglas production function of Example 3.
SOLUTION In Figure 18 we use a computer to draw a contour plot for the Cobb-Douglas
production function
Level curves are labeled with the value of the production P. For instance, the level curve
labeled 140 shows all values of the labor L and capital investment K that result in a pro-
duction of 
. We see that, for a ﬁxed value of P, as L increases K decreases, and
vice versa.
M
For some purposes, a contour map is more useful than a graph. That is certainly true in
Example 13. (Compare Figure 18 with Figure 8.) It is also true in estimating function val-
ues, as in Example 9.

Figure 19 shows some computer-generated level curves together with the corresponding
computer-generated graphs. Notice that the level curves in part (c) crowd together near the
origin. That corresponds to the fact that the graph in part (d) is very steep near the origin.
FUNCTIONS OF THREE OR MORE VARIABLES
A function of three variables, , is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple 
in a
domain 
a unique real number denoted by 
. For instance, the temperature
at a point on the surface of the earth depends on the longitude x and latitude y of the
point and on the time t, so we could write 
.

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

It’s very difﬁcult to visualize a function 
of three variables by its graph, since that
would lie in a four-dimensional space. However, we do gain some insight into 
by exam-
ining its level surfaces, which are the surfaces with equations 
, where 
is 
a constant. If the point 
moves along a level surface, the value of 
remains
ﬁxed.
EXAMPLE 15 Find the level surfaces of the function
SOLUTION The level surfaces are 
, where 
. These form a family of
concentric spheres with radius 
. (See Figure 20.) Thus, as 
varies over any
sphere with center , the value of 
remains ﬁxed.
M
Functions of any number of variables can be considered. A function of n variables
is a rule that assigns a number 
to an -tuple 
of real
numbers. We denote by 
the set of all such n-tuples. For example, if a company uses 
different ingredients in making a food product, 
is the cost per unit of the 
ingredient,
and 
units of the 
ingredient are used, then the total cost 
of the ingredients is a func-
tion of the variables 
:
The function is a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of 
. Sometimes we
will use vector notation to write such functions more compactly: If 
,
we often write 
in place of 
. With this notation we can rewrite the
function deﬁned in Equation 3 as
where 
and 
denotes the dot product of the vectors c and x in 
.
In view of the one-to-one correspondence between points 
in 
and
their position vectors 
in 
, we have three ways of looking at a func-
tion f deﬁned on a subset of 
:
1. As a function of real variables 
2. As a function of a single point variable 
3. As a function of a single vector variable 
We will see that all three points of view are useful.

to indicate that the values of 
approach the number L as the point 
approaches
the point 
along any path that stays within the domain of
. In other words, we can
make the values of 
as close to L as we like by taking the point 
sufﬁciently
close to the point 
, but not equal to 
. A more precise deﬁnition follows.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function of two variables whose domain D includes
points arbitrarily close to 
. Then we say that the limit of 
as 
approaches 
is 
and we write
if for every number 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
and
then
Other notations for the limit in Deﬁnition 1 are
and
Notice that 
is the distance between the numbers 
and , and
is the distance between the point 
and the point 
. Thus
Deﬁnition 1 says that the distance between 
and 
can be made arbitrarily small by
making the distance from 
to 
sufﬁciently small (but not 0). Figure 1 illustrates
Deﬁnition 1 by means of an arrow diagram. If any small interval 
is given
around , then we can ﬁnd a disk 
with center 
and radius 
such that 
maps
all the points in 
[except possibly 
] into the interval 
.
Another illustration of Deﬁnition 1 is given in Figure 2 where the surface is the graph
of . If 
is given, we can ﬁnd 
such that if 
is restricted to lie in the disk
and 
, then the corresponding part of lies between the horizontal planes
and 
.
For functions of a single variable, when we let 
approach , there are only two pos-
sible directions of approach, from the left or from the right. We recall from Chapter 2 that
if 
, then 
does not exist.
For functions of two variables the situation is not as simple because we can let 
approach 
from an inﬁnite number of directions in any manner whatsoever (see
Figure 3) as long as 
stays within the domain of .f

Deﬁnition 1 says that the distance between 
and L can be made arbitrarily small
by making the distance from 
to 
sufﬁciently small (but not 0). The deﬁnition
refers only to the distance between 
and 
. It does not refer to the direction of
approach. Therefore, if the limit exists, then 
must approach the same limit no mat-
ter how 
approaches 
. Thus if we can ﬁnd two different paths of approach along
which the function 
has different limits, then it follows that 
does
not exist.
If 
as

and 
as
along a path 
, where 
, then

EXAMPLE 1 Show that 
does not exist.
SOLUTION Let 
. First let’s approach 
along the -axis.
Then 
gives 
for all 
, so
We now approach along the -axis by putting 
. Then 
for 
all 
, so
(See Figure 4.) Since 
has two different limits along two different lines, the given limit
does not exist. (This conﬁrms the conjecture we made on the basis of numerical evidence
at the beginning of this section.)

EXAMPLE 2 If 
, does 
exist?
SOLUTION If 
, then 
. Therefore
If 
, then 
, so
Although we have obtained identical limits along the axes, that does not show that the
given limit is 0. Let’s now approach 
along another line, say 
. For all 
,
Therefore
(See Figure 5.) Since we have obtained different limits along different paths, the given
limit does not exist.

So
Thus

that does not show that the given limit is 0, for if we now let

so
Since different paths lead to different limiting values, the given limit does not exist.

Now let’s look at limits that do exist. Just as for functions of one variable, the calcula-
tion of limits for functions of two variables can be greatly simpliﬁed by the use of proper-
ties of limits. The Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 can be extended to functions of two
variables: The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, the limit of a product is the product
of the limits, and so on. In particular, the following equations are true.
The Squeeze Theorem also holds.
EXAMPLE 4 Find 
if it exists.
SOLUTION As in Example 3, we could show that the limit along any line through the 
origin is 0. This doesn’t prove that the given limit is 0, but the limits along the parabolas

CONTINUITY
Recall that evaluating limits of continuous functions of a single variable is easy. It can be
accomplished by direct substitution because the deﬁning property of a continuous function
is 
. Continuous functions of two variables are also deﬁned by the direct
substitution property.
DEFINITION A function 
of two variables is called continuous at
if
We say 
is continuous on 
if 
is continuous at every point 
in .
The intuitive meaning of continuity is that if the point 
changes by a small amount,
then the value of 
changes by a small amount. This means that a surface that is the
graph of a continuous function has no hole or break.
Using the properties of limits, you can see that sums, differences, products, and quo-
tients of continuous functions are continuous on their domains. Let’s use this fact to give
examples of continuous functions.
A polynomial function of two variables (or polynomial, for short) is a sum of terms
of the form 
, where is a constant and 
and are nonnegative integers. A rational
function is a ratio of polynomials. For instance,

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
N Another way to do Example 4 is to use the
Squeeze Theorem instead of Deﬁnition 1. From
(2) it follows that
and so the ﬁrst inequality in (3) shows that the
given limit is 0.

is a polynomial, whereas
is a rational function.
The limits in (2) show that the functions 
, 
, and 
are
continuous. Since any polynomial can be built up out of the simple functions , , and 
by multiplication and addition, it follows that all polynomials are continuous on 
.
Likewise, any rational function is continuous on its domain because it is a quotient of 
continuous functions.
EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate

SOLUTION Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous every-
where, so we can ﬁnd the limit by direct substitution:
M
EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function 
continuous?
SOLUTION The function 
is discontinuous at 
because it is not deﬁned there. 
Since 
is a rational function, it is continuous on its domain, which is the set

Also, from Example 4, we have
Therefore

Just as for functions of one variable, composition is another way of combining two con-
tinuous functions to get a third. In fact, it can be shown that if
is a continuous function
of two variables and 
is a continuous function of a single variable that is deﬁned on the
range of , then the composite function 
deﬁned by 
is also a
continuous function.

FUNCTIONS OF THREE OR MORE VARIABLES
Everything that we have done in this section can be extended to functions of three or more
variables. The notation
means that the values of 
approach the number L as the point 
approaches
the point 
along any path in the domain of f. Because the distance between two
points 
and 
in 
is given by 
, we can
write the precise deﬁnition as follows: For every number 
there is a corresponding
number 
such that
if
and
then
The function f is continuous at 
if
For instance, the function
is a rational function of three variables and so is continuous at every point in 
except
where 
. In other words, it is discontinuous on the sphere with center the
origin and radius 1.
If we use the vector notation introduced at the end of Section 14.1, then we can write
the deﬁnitions of a limit for functions of two or three variables in a single compact form
as follows.
If

, then 
means that for
every number 
there is a corresponding number 
such that

Notice that if

functions of a single variable. For the case 
, we have

and

,

three variables. In each case the deﬁnition of continuity can be written as

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
On a hot day, extreme humidity makes us think the temperature is higher than it really 
is, whereas in very dry air we perceive the temperature to be lower than the thermom-
eter indicates. The National Weather Service has devised the heat index (also called the
temperature-humidity index, or humidex, in some countries) to describe the combined
effects of temperature and humidity. The heat index I is the perceived air temperature when
the actual temperature is T and the relative humidity is H. So I is a function of T and H and
we can write 
The following table of values of I is an excerpt from a table
compiled by the National Weather Service.
If we concentrate on the highlighted column of the table, which corresponds to a rela-
tive humidity of H  70%, we are considering the heat index as a function of the single
variable T for a ﬁxed value of H. Let’s write 
. Then 
describes how the
heat index I increases as the actual temperature T increases when the relative humidity is
70%. The derivative of t when 
is the rate of change of I with respect to T when

TABLE 1
Heat index as a function of 
temperature and humidity
I

We can approximate 
using the values in Table 1 by taking 
and 
:
Averaging these values, we can say that the derivative 
is approximately 3.75. This
means that, when the actual temperature is 
and the relative humidity is 70%, the
apparent temperature (heat index) rises by about 
for every degree that the actual
temperature rises!
Now let’s look at the highlighted row in Table 1, which corresponds to a ﬁxed temper-
ature of 
. The numbers in this row are values of the function 
,
which describes how the heat index increases as the relative humidity H increases when
the actual temperature is 
. The derivative of this function when H  70% is the
rate of change of I with respect to H when H  70%:
By taking h  5 and 5, we approximate 
using the tabular values:
By averaging these values we get the estimate 
. This says that, when the tem-
perature is 
and the relative humidity is 70%, the heat index rises about

With this notation for partial derivatives, we can write the rates of change of the heat

INTERPRETATIONS OF PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
To give a geometric interpretation of partial derivatives, we recall that the equation
represents a surface (the graph of ). If 
, then the point 
lies on . By ﬁxing 
, we are restricting our attention to the curve 
in which the ver-
tical plane 
intersects S. (In other words, 
is the trace of 
in the plane 
.)
Likewise, the vertical plane 
intersects in a curve 
. Both of the curves 
and 
pass through the point . (See Figure 1.)
Notice that the curve 
is the graph of the function 
, so the slope of its
tangent
at
is
. The curve
is the graph of the function
,
so the slope of its tangent 
at 
is 
.
Thus the partial derivatives 
and 
can be interpreted geometrically as the
slopes of the tangent lines at 
to the traces 
and 
of 
in the planes 
and 
.
As we have seen in the case of the heat index function, partial derivatives can also be
interpreted as rates of change. If 
, then 
represents the rate of change of 
with respect to 
when is ﬁxed. Similarly, 
represents the rate of change of with
respect to when is ﬁxed.

N Alexis Clairaut was a child prodigy in 
mathematics: he read l’Hospital’s textbook 
on calculus when he was ten and presented a
paper on geometry to the French Academy of 
Sciences when he was 13. At the age of 18,
Clairaut published Recherches sur les courbes à
double courbure, which was the ﬁrst systematic
treatise on three-dimensional analytic geometry
and included the calculus of space curves.

PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Partial derivatives occur in partial differential equations that express certain physical laws.
For instance, the partial differential equation
is called Laplace’s equation after Pierre Laplace (1749–1827). Solutions of this equation
are called harmonic functions; they play a role in problems of heat conduction, ﬂuid ﬂow,
and electric potential.
EXAMPLE 8 Show that the function 
is a solution of Laplace’s 
equation.
SOLUTION
Therefore 
satisﬁes Laplace’s equation.
M
The wave equation
describes the motion of a waveform, which could be an ocean wave, a sound wave, a light
wave, or a wave traveling along a vibrating string. For instance, if 
represents the dis-
placement of a vibrating violin string at time 
and at a distance 
from one end of the
string (as in Figure 8), then 
satisﬁes the wave equation. Here the constant depends
on the density of the string and on the tension in the string.
EXAMPLE 9 Verify that the function 
satisﬁes the wave equation.

So satisﬁes the wave equation.

THE COBB-DOUGLAS PRODUCTION FUNCTION
In Example 3 in Section 14.1 we described the work of Cobb and Douglas in modeling the
total production P of an economic system as a function of the amount of labor L and the
capital investment K. Here we use partial derivatives to show how the particular form of
their model follows from certain assumptions they made about the economy.
If the production function is denoted by 
, then the partial derivative 
is the rate at which production changes with respect to the amount of labor. Economists
call it the marginal production with respect to labor or the marginal productivity of labor.
Likewise, the partial derivative 
is the rate of change of production with respect to
capital and is called the marginal productivity of capital. In these terms, the assumptions
made by Cobb and Douglas can be stated as follows.
(i) If either labor or capital vanishes, then so will production.
(ii) The marginal productivity of labor is proportional to the amount of production
per unit of labor.
(iii) The marginal productivity of capital is proportional to the amount of production
per unit of capital.
Because the production per unit of labor is 
, assumption (ii) says that
for some constant . If we keep K constant 
, then this partial differential equa-
tion becomes an ordinary differential equation:
If we solve this separable differential equation by the methods of Section 9.3 (see also
Exercise 79), we get
Notice that we have written the constant 
as a function of 
because it could depend on
the value of 
.
Similarly, assumption (iii) says that
and we can solve this differential equation to get

The temperature 
at a location in the Northern Hemisphere
depends on the longitude , latitude , and time , so we can
write 
. Let’s measure time in hours from the
beginning of January.
(a) What are the meanings of the partial derivatives 
, and 
?
(b) Honolulu has longitude 
and latitude 
.
Suppose that at 9:00 AM on January 1 the wind is blowing
hot air to the northeast, so the air to the west and south is
warm and the air to the north and east is cooler. Would you
expect 
, and 
to be
positive or negative? Explain.
2. At the beginning of this section we discussed the function
, where is the heat index, 
is the temperature,
and 
is the relative humidity. Use Table 1 to estimate
and 
. What are the practical interpretations
of these values?
3. The wind-chill index 
is the perceived temperature when the
actual temperature is 
and the wind speed is , so we can
write

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
TANGENT PLANES AND LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS
One of the most important ideas in single-variable calculus is that as we zoom in toward a
point on the graph of a differentiable function, the graph becomes indistinguishable from
its tangent line and we can approximate the function by a linear function. (See Sec-
tion 3.10.) Here we develop similar ideas in three dimensions. As we zoom in toward a
point on a surface that is the graph of a differentiable function of two variables, the surface
looks more and more like a plane (its tangent plane) and we can approximate the function
by a linear function of two variables. We also extend the idea of a differential to functions
of two or more variables.
TANGENT PLANES
Suppose a surface 
has equation 
, where 
has continuous ﬁrst partial deriva-
tives, and let 
be a point on . As in the preceding section, let 
and 
be the
curves obtained by intersecting the vertical planes 
and 
with the surface .
Then the point 
lies on both 
and 
. Let 
and 
be the tangent lines to the curves 
and 
at the point . Then the tangent plane to the surface 
at the point 
is deﬁned to
be the plane that contains both tangent lines 
and 
. (See Figure 1.)
We will see in Section 14.6 that if 
is any other curve that lies on the surface 
and
passes through , then its tangent line at 
also lies in the tangent plane. Therefore you 
can think of the tangent plane to 
at 
as consisting of all possible tangent lines at 
to
curves that lie on 
and pass through . The tangent plane at 
is the plane that most 
closely approximates the surface 
near the point .
We know from Equation 12.5.7 that any plane passing through the point 
has
an equation of the form
By dividing this equation by 
and letting 
and 
, we can write it in
the form
If Equation 1 represents the tangent plane at , then its intersection with the plane 
must be the tangent line 
. Setting 
in Equation 1 gives
and we recognize these as the equations (in point-slope form) of a line with slope . 
But from Section 14.3 we know that the slope of the tangent 
is 
. Therefore
.
Similarly, putting 
in Equation 1, we get 
, which must repre-
sent the tangent line 
, so 
.
Suppose 
has continuous partial derivatives. An equation of the tangent plane
to the surface 
at the point 
is

Figure 2(a) shows the elliptic paraboloid and its tangent plane at

in Example 1. In parts (b) and (c) we zoom in toward the point 
by restricting the
domain of the function

the graph appears and the more it resembles its tangent plane.
In Figure 3 we corroborate this impression by zooming in toward the point 
on a
contour map of the function

more the level curves look like equally spaced parallel lines, which is characteristic of a
plane.

LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS
In Example 1 we found that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of the function
at the point 
is 
. Therefore, in view of the
visual evidence in Figures 2 and 3, the linear function of two variables
is a good approximation to 
when 
is near 
. The function L is called the
linearization of f at 
and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or tangent plane approximation of f at 
.
For instance, at the point (1.1, 0.95) the linear approximation gives
which is quite close to the true value of 
. But if
we take a point farther away from 
, such as 
, we no longer get a good approxi-
mation. In fact, 
whereas 
.
In general, we know from (2) that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of a
function f of two variables at the point 
is
The linear function whose graph is this tangent plane, namely
is called the linearization of f at 
and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or the tangent plane approximation of 
at
We have deﬁned tangent planes for surfaces 
, where 
has continuous ﬁrst
partial derivatives. What happens if 
and 
are not continuous? Figure 4 pictures such a
function; its equation is
You can verify (see Exercise 46) that its partial derivatives exist at the origin and, in fact,
and 
, but 
and 
are not continuous. The linear approximation
would be 
, but 
at all points on the line 
. So a function of two
variables can behave badly even though both of its partial derivatives exist. To rule out
such behavior, we formulate the idea of a differentiable function of two variables.
Recall that for a function of one variable, 
, if x changes from a to 
we

In Chapter 3 we showed that if 
is differentiable at a, then
Now consider a function of two variables, 
, and suppose x changes from a to
and y changes from b to 
. Then the corresponding increment of is
Thus the increment 
represents the change in the value of 
when 
changes from
to 
. By analogy with (5) we deﬁne the differentiability of a func-
tion of two variables as follows.
DEFINITION If 
, then 
is differentiable at 
if

expressed in the form
where 
and 
as 
.
Deﬁnition 7 says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approxima-
tion (4) is a good approximation when 
is near 
. In other words, the tangent
plane approximates the graph of f well near the point of tangency.
It’s sometimes hard to use Deﬁnition 7 directly to check the differentiability of a func-
tion, but the next theorem provides a convenient sufﬁcient condition for differentiability.
THEOREM If the partial derivatives 
and 
exist near 
and are continu-
ous at 
, then 
is differentiable at

EXAMPLE 2 Show that

tion there. Then use it to approximate

SOLUTION The partial derivatives are
Both 
and 
are continuous functions, so

linearization is
The corresponding linear approximation is

EXAMPLE 3 At the beginning of Section 14.3 we discussed the heat index (perceived
temperature) as a function of the actual temperature 
and the relative humidity 
and
gave the following table of values from the National Weather Service.
Find a linear approximation for the heat index 
when 
is near 
and 
is
near 70%. Use it to estimate the heat index when the temperature is 
and the relative
humidity is 72%.
SOLUTION We read from the table that 
. In Section 14.3 we used the tabu-
lar values to estimate that 
and

So the linear approximation is
In particular,
Therefore, when

, we deﬁne the differential dx to be
an independent variable; that is, dx can be given the value of any real number. The differ-
ential of is then deﬁned as

and the dif-

For a differentiable function of two variables,

SOLUTION The volume

Since each error is at most

FUNCTIONS OF THREE OR MORE VARIABLES
Linear approximations, differentiability, and differentials can be deﬁned in a similar man-
ner for functions of more than two variables. A differentiable function is deﬁned by an
expression similar to the one in Deﬁnition 7. For such functions the linear approximation
is
and the linearization 
is the right side of this expression.
If 
, then the increment of 
is
The differential
is deﬁned in terms of the differentials

, and 
of the independ-
ent variables by
EXAMPLE 6 The dimensions of a rectangular box are measured to be 75 cm, 60 cm, 
and 40 cm, and each measurement is correct to within 
cm. Use differentials to esti-
mate the largest possible error when the volume of the box is calculated from these
measurements.
SOLUTION If the dimensions of the box are , , and , its volume is 
and so
We are given that 
, 
, and 
. To ﬁnd the largest error in
the volume, we therefore use 
, 
, and 
together with 
,
, and 
:
Thus an error of only 
cm in measuring each dimension could lead to an error of as
much as 1980 cm in the calculated volume! This may seem like a large error, but it’s
only about 1% of the volume of the box.

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

THE CHAIN RULE
Recall that the Chain Rule for functions of a single variable gives the rule for differenti-
ating a composite function: If 
and 
, where and are differentiable func-
tions, then is indirectly a differentiable function of and
For functions of more than one variable, the Chain Rule has several versions, each of
them giving a rule for differentiating a composite function. The ﬁrst version (Theorem 2)
deals with the case where 
and each of the variables and is, in turn, a func-
tion of a variable . This means that is indirectly a function of , 
, and the
Chain Rule gives a formula for differentiating as a function of . We assume that 
is dif-
ferentiable (Deﬁnition 14.4.7). Recall that this is the case when 
and 
are continuous
(Theorem 14.4.8).
THE CHAIN RULE (CASE 1) Suppose that 
is a differentiable func-
tion of and , where 
and 
are both differentiable functions of .
Then is a differentiable function of and
PROOF
A change of 
in produces changes of 
in and 
in . These, in turn, pro-
duce a change of 
in , and from Deﬁnition 14.4.7 we have
where 
and 
as 
. [If the functions 
and 
are not
deﬁned at 
, we can deﬁne them to be 0 there.] Dividing both sides of this equation
by 
, we have
If we now let 
, then 
because is differentiable and
therefore continuous. Similarly, 
. This, in turn, means that

Since we often write 
in place of 
, we can rewrite the Chain Rule in the form
EXAMPLE 1 If 
, where 
and 
, ﬁnd 
when 
.
SOLUTION The Chain Rule gives
It’s not necessary to substitute the expressions for and in terms of . We simply
observe that when 
, we have x  sin 0  0 and y  cos 0  1. Therefore
M
The derivative in Example 1 can be interpreted as the rate of change of with respect
to 
as the point 
moves along the curve 
with parametric equations 
,
. (See Figure 1.) In particular, when 
, the point 
is 
and 
is the rate of increase as we move along the curve 
through 
. If, for instance,
represents the temperature at the point 
, then the compos-
ite function 
represents the temperature at points on 
and the deriva-
tive 
represents the rate at which the temperature changes along .
EXAMPLE 2 The pressure 
(in kilopascals), volume 
(in liters), and temperature 
(in kelvins) of a mole of an ideal gas are related by the equation 
. Find the
rate at which the pressure is changing when the temperature is 
and increasing at a
rate of 
and the volume is 100 L and increasing at a rate of 
.
SOLUTION If represents the time elapsed in seconds, then at the given instant we have
, 
, 
, 
. Since
the Chain Rule gives
The pressure is decreasing at a rate of about 
kPa	s.

wish to ﬁnd 
and 
. Recall that in computing 
we hold ﬁxed and compute
the ordinary derivative of with respect to . Therefore we can apply Theorem 2 to obtain
A similar argument holds for 
and so we have proved the following version of the
Chain Rule.
THE CHAIN RULE (CASE 2) Suppose that 
is a differentiable func-
tion of and , where 
and 
are differentiable functions of s
and t. Then
EXAMPLE 3 If 
, where 
and

and 
.
SOLUTION Applying Case 2 of the Chain Rule, we get
M
Case 2 of the Chain Rule contains three types of variables: 
and 
are independent
variables, 
and 
are called intermediate variables, and 
is the dependent variable.
Notice that Theorem 3 has one term for each intermediate variable and each of these terms
resembles the one-dimensional Chain Rule in Equation 1.
To remember the Chain Rule, it’s helpful to draw the tree diagram in Figure 2. We draw
branches from the dependent variable 
to the intermediate variables 
and 
to indicate
that 
is a function of 
and . Then we draw branches from 
and 
to the independent
variables 
and . On each branch we write the corresponding partial derivative. To ﬁnd
, we ﬁnd the product of the partial derivatives along each path from to and then
add these products:
Similarly, we ﬁnd 
by using the paths from to .
Now we consider the general situation in which a dependent variable is a function of
intermediate variables 
, 
, each of which is, in turn, a function of 
independent
variables , 
. Notice that there are 
terms, one for each intermediate variable. The
proof is similar to that of Case 1.

IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION
The Chain Rule can be used to give a more complete description of the process of implicit
differentiation that was introduced in Sections 3.5 and 14.3. We suppose that an equa-
tion of the form

implicitly as a differentiable function of , that is,
, where

apply Case 1 of the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation

To derive this equation we assumed that 
deﬁnes 
implicitly as a function
of . The Implicit Function Theorem, proved in advanced calculus, gives conditions
under which this assumption is valid: It states that if 
is deﬁned on a disk containing
where 
, 
, and 
and 
are continuous on the disk, then the
equation 
deﬁnes as a function of near the point 
and the derivative of
this function is given by Equation 6.
EXAMPLE 8 Find 
if 
.
SOLUTION The given equation can be written as
so Equation 6 gives
M
Now we suppose that is given implicitly as a function 
by an equation of
the form 
. This means that 
for all 
in the domain 
of . If 
and are differentiable, then we can use the Chain Rule to differentiate the equa-
tion 
as follows:
But
so this equation becomes
If 
, we solve for 
and obtain the ﬁrst formula in Equations 7. The formula
for 
is obtained in a similar manner.
Again, a version of the Implicit Function Theorem gives conditions under which 
our assumption is valid: If 
is deﬁned within a sphere containing 
, where
, 
, and 
, 
, and 
are continuous inside the sphere, then the
equation 
deﬁnes as a function of 
and 
near the point 
and this
function is differentiable, with partial derivatives given by (7).

35 parts per thousand has been modeled by the equation
where 
is the speed of sound (in meters per second), 
is the
temperature (in degrees Celsius), and 
is the depth below the
ocean surface (in meters). A scuba diver began a leisurely dive
into the ocean water; the diver’s depth and the surrounding
water temperature over time are recorded in the following
graphs. Estimate the rate of change (with respect to time) of 
the speed of sound through the ocean water experienced by the
diver 20 minutes into the dive. What are the units?

west on Highway 83. Each car is approaching the intersection
of these highways. At a certain moment, car A is 0.3 km from

from the intersection and traveling at 80 kmh. How fast is the
distance between the cars changing at that moment?

DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT VECTOR
The weather map in Figure 1 shows a contour map of the temperature function 
for
the states of California and Nevada at 3:00 PM on a day in October. The level curves, or
isothermals, join locations with the same temperature. The partial derivative 
at a loca-
tion such as Reno is the rate of change of temperature with respect to distance if we travel
east from Reno; 
is the rate of change of temperature if we travel north. But what if we
want to know the rate of change of temperature when we travel southeast (toward Las
Vegas), or in some other direction? In this section we introduce a type of derivative, called
a directional derivative, that enables us to ﬁnd the rate of change of a function of two or
more variables in any direction.
DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES
Recall that if 
, then the partial derivatives 
and 
are deﬁned as
and represent the rates of change of in the - and -directions, that is, in the directions of
the unit vectors and .

THE GRADIENT VECTOR
Notice from Theorem 3 that the directional derivative can be written as the dot product of
two vectors:
The ﬁrst vector in this dot product occurs not only in computing directional derivatives but
in many other contexts as well. So we give it a special name (the gradient of ) and a spe-
cial notation (grad
or 
, which is read “del ”).
DEFINITION If 
is a function of two variables and , then the gradient of 
is the vector function 
deﬁned by
EXAMPLE 3 If

With this notation for the gradient vector, we can rewrite the expression (7) for the
directional derivative as
This expresses the directional derivative in the direction of as the scalar projection of the
gradient vector onto .

FUNCTIONS OF THREE VARIABLES
For functions of three variables we can deﬁne directional derivatives in a similar manner.

can be interpreted as the rate of change of the function in the direction
of a unit vector .
DEFINITION The directional derivative of

if this limit exists.
If we use vector notation, then we can write both deﬁnitions (2 and 10) of the direc-
tional derivative in the compact form

the vector equation of the line through

TANGENT PLANES TO LEVEL SURFACES
Suppose 
is a surface with equation 
, that is, it is a level surface of a func-
tion 
of three variables, and let 
be a point on . Let 
be any curve that lies
on the surface and passes through the point . Recall from Section 13.1 that the curve 
is described by a continuous vector function 
. Let 
be the param-
eter value corresponding to 
; that is, 
. Since 
lies on , any point
must satisfy the equation of , that is,
If , , and are differentiable functions of and 
is also differentiable, then we can use
the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of Equation 16 as follows:
But, since 
and 
, Equation 17 can be written in
terms of a dot product as
In particular, when 
we have 
, so
Equation 18 says that the gradient vector at , 
, is perpendicular to the 
tangent vector 
to any curve 
on 
that passes through . (See Figure 9.) If
, it is therefore natural to deﬁne the tangent plane to the level surface
at
as the plane that passes through 
and has normal vector
. Using the standard equation of a plane (Equation 12.5.7), we can write the

The normal line to 
at 
is the line passing through 
and perpendicular to the tan-

and so, by Equation 12.5.3, its symmetric equations are
In the special case in which the equation of a surface

(that
is, 
is the graph of a function

so Equation 19 becomes
which is equivalent to Equation 14.4.2. Thus our new, more general, deﬁnition of a tangent
plane is consistent with the deﬁnition that was given for the special case of Section 14.4.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GRADIENT VECTOR
We now summarize the ways in which the gradient vector is signiﬁcant. We ﬁrst consider
a function 
of three variables and a point 
in its domain. On the one hand, we
know from Theorem 15 that the gradient vector 
gives the direction of fastest
increase of . On the other hand, we know that 
is orthogonal to the level sur-
face of 
through . (Refer to Figure 9.) These two properties are quite compatible intu-
itively because as we move away from 
on the level surface , the value of 
does not
change at all. So it seems reasonable that if we move in the perpendicular direction, we get
the maximum increase.
In like manner we consider a function 
of two variables and a point 
in its
domain. Again the gradient vector 
gives the direction of fastest increase of .
Also, by considerations similar to our discussion of tangent planes, it can be shown that
is perpendicular to the level curve 
that passes through . Again this
is intuitively plausible because the values of 
remain constant as we move along the
curve. (See Figure 11.)
If we consider a topographical map of a hill and let 
represent the height above
sea level at a point with coordinates 
, then a curve of steepest ascent can be drawn as
in Figure 12 by making it perpendicular to all of the contour lines. This phenomenon can
also be noticed in Figure 12 in Section 14.1, where Lonesome Creek follows a curve of
steepest descent.
Computer algebra systems have commands that plot sample gradient vectors. Each gra-
dient vector 
is plotted starting at the point 
. Figure 13 shows such a plot
(called a gradient vector ﬁeld) for the function 
superimposed on a con-
tour map of f. As expected, the gradient vectors point “uphill” and are perpendicular to the
level curves.

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES
As we saw in Chapter 4, one of the main uses of ordinary derivatives is in ﬁnding maxi-
mum and minimum values. In this section we see how to use partial derivatives to locate
maxima and minima of functions of two variables. In particular, in Example 6 we will see
how to maximize the volume of a box without a lid if we have a ﬁxed amount of cardboard
to work with.
14.7

Look at the hills and valleys in the graph of 
shown in Figure 1. There are two points
where 
has a local maximum, that is, where 
is larger than nearby values of
. The larger of these two values is the absolute maximum. Likewise, 
has two local
minima, where 
is smaller than nearby values. The smaller of these two values is the
absolute minimum.
DEFINITION A function of two variables has a local maximum at
if
when 
is near 
. [This means that 
for
all points 
in some disk with center 
.] The number 
is called a
local maximum value. If 
when 
is near 
, then 
has a
local minimum at
and
is a local minimum value.
If the inequalities in Deﬁnition 1 hold for all points 
in the domain of , then has
an absolute maximum (or absolute minimum) at 
.
THEOREM If 
has a local maximum or minimum at 
and the ﬁrst-order
partial derivatives of 
exist there, then 
and 
.
PROOF
Let 
. If 
has a local maximum (or minimum) at 
, then has a
local maximum (or minimum) at , so 
by Fermat’s Theorem (see Theorem 4.1.4).
But 
(see Equation 14.3.1) and so 
. Similarly, by applying
Fermat’s Theorem to the function 
, we obtain 
.
M
If we put 
and 
in the equation of a tangent plane (Equation
14.4.2), we get 
. Thus the geometric interpretation of Theorem 2 is that if the graph
of 
has a tangent plane at a local maximum or minimum, then the tangent plane must be
horizontal.
A point 
is called a critical point (or stationary point) of 
if 
and
, or if one of these partial derivatives does not exist. Theorem 2 says that if 
has a local maximum or minimum at 
, then 
is a critical point of . However, as
in single-variable calculus, not all critical points give rise to maxima or minima. At a crit-
ical point, a function could have a local maximum or a local minimum or neither.
EXAMPLE 1 Let 
. Then
These partial derivatives are equal to 0 when 
and 
, so the only critical point
is 
. By completing the square, we ﬁnd that
Since 
and 
, we have 
for all values of and .
Therefore 
is a local minimum, and in fact it is the absolute minimum 
of . This can be conﬁrmed geometrically from the graph of 
which is the elliptic
paraboloid with vertex 
shown in Figure 2.

EXAMPLE 2 Find the extreme values of

SOLUTION Since 
and 
, the only critical point is 
. Notice that 
for points on the -axis we have 
, so 
(if 
). However, for
points on the -axis we have 
, so 
(if 
). Thus every disk 
with center 
contains points where 
takes positive values as well as points where 
takes negative values. Therefore 
can’t be an extreme value for , so 
has
no extreme value.

Example 2 illustrates the fact that a function need not have a maximum or minimum
value at a critical point. Figure 3 shows how this is possible. The graph of 
is the hyper-
bolic paraboloid 
, which has a horizontal tangent plane (
) at the origin.
You can see that 
is a maximum in the direction of the -axis but a minimum
in the direction of the -axis. Near the origin the graph has the shape of a saddle and so
is called a saddle point of .
We need to be able to determine whether or not a function has an extreme value at a
critical point. The following test, which is proved at the end of this section, is analogous
to the Second Derivative Test for functions of one variable.
SECOND DERIVATIVES TEST Suppose the second partial derivatives of 
are
continuous on a disk with center 
, and suppose that 
and
[that is, 
is a critical point of ]. Let
(a) If 
and 
, then 
is a local minimum.
(b) If 
and 
, then 
is a local maximum.
(c) If 
, then 
is not a local maximum or minimum.
In case (c) the point 
is called a saddle point of 
and the graph of 
crosses its tangent plane at 
.
If 
, the test gives no information: 
could have a local maximum or local
minimum at 
, or 
could be a saddle point of .
To remember the formula for , it’s helpful to write it as a determinant:
EXAMPLE 3 Find the local maximum and minimum values and saddle points of
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst locate the critical points:
Setting these partial derivatives equal to 0, we obtain the equations
To solve these equations we substitute 
from the ﬁrst equation into the second
one. This gives

so there are three real roots:

. The three critical points are

Next we calculate the second partial derivatives and 
:
Since 
, it follows from case (c) of the Second Derivatives Test that
the origin is a saddle point; that is, 
has no local maximum or minimum at

Since

In the second case

and, putting this in Equation 5, we have 
. So we have to
solve the cubic equation
Using a graphing calculator or computer to graph the function
as in Figure 6, we see that Equation 7 has three real roots. By zooming in, we can ﬁnd
the roots to four decimal places:
(Alternatively, we could have used Newton’s method or a rootﬁnder to locate these
roots.) From Equation 6, the corresponding -values are given by
If

points, which are analyzed in the following chart. All quantities are rounded to two 
decimal places.
Figures 7 and 8 give two views of the graph of

ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES
For a function 
of one variable the Extreme Value Theorem says that if 
is continuous
on a closed interval 
, then 
has an absolute minimum value and an absolute maxi-
mum value. According to the Closed Interval Method in Section 4.1, we found these by
evaluating 
not only at the critical numbers but also at the endpoints and .
There is a similar situation for functions of two variables. Just as a closed interval con-
tains its endpoints, a closed set in 
is one that contains all its boundary points. [A bound-
ary point of D is a point 
such that every disk with center 
contains points in D
and also points not in D.] For instance, the disk
which consists of all points on and inside the circle 
, is a closed set because it
contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle 
). But if
even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would not be closed. (See 
Figure 11.)
A bounded set in 
is one that is contained within some disk. In other words, it is
ﬁnite in extent. Then, in terms of closed and bounded sets, we can state the following coun-
terpart of the Extreme Value Theorem in two dimensions.
EXTREME VALUE THEOREM FOR FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES If 
is continu-
ous on a closed, bounded set 
in 
, then 
attains an absolute maximum value
and an absolute minimum value 
at some points

To ﬁnd the extreme values guaranteed by Theorem 8, we note that, by Theorem 2, if 
has an extreme value at 
, then 
is either a critical point of 
or a boundary
point of . Thus we have the following extension of the Closed Interval Method.
To ﬁnd the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function 
on a closed, bounded set 
:
1. Find the values of 
at the critical points of 
in .
2. Find the extreme values of 
on the boundary of .
3. The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; 
the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.
EXAMPLE 7 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function
on the rectangle 
.
SOLUTION Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous on the closed, bounded rectangle , 
so Theorem 8 tells us there is both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.
According to step 1 in (9), we ﬁrst ﬁnd the critical points. These occur when
so the only critical point is 
, and the value of 
there is 
.
In step 2 we look at the values of 
on the boundary of , which consists of the four
line segments 
, 
, 
, 
shown in Figure 12. On 
we have 
and
This is an increasing function of , so its minimum value is 
and its maxi-
mum value is 
. On 
we have 
and
This is a decreasing function of , so its maximum value is 
and its minimum
value is 
. On 
we have 
and
By the methods of Chapter 4, or simply by observing that 
, we see
that the minimum value of this function is 
and the maximum value is
. Finally, on 
we have 
and
with maximum value 
and minimum value 
. Thus, on the bound-
ary, the minimum value of 
is 0 and the maximum is 9.
In step 3 we compare these values with the value 
at the critical point and
conclude that the absolute maximum value of 
on 
is 
and the absolute
minimum value is 
. Figure 13 shows the graph of .

We close this section by giving a proof of the ﬁrst part of the Second Derivatives Test.
Part (b) has a similar proof.
PROOF OF THEOREM 3, PART (A)
We compute the second-order directional derivative of 
in
the direction of 
. The ﬁrst-order derivative is given by Theorem 14.6.3:
Applying this theorem a second time, we have
(by Clairaut’s Theorem)
If we complete the square in this expression, we obtain
We are given that 
and 
. But 
and 
are con-
tinuous functions, so there is a disk 
with center 
and radius 
such that
and 
whenever 
is in . Therefore, by looking at Equation
10, we see that 
whenever 
is in . This means that if 
is the curve
obtained by intersecting the graph of 
with the vertical plane through 
in
the direction of , then 
is concave upward on an interval of length 
. This is true in
the direction of every vector , so if we restrict 
to lie in , the graph of 
lies
above its horizontal tangent plane at . Thus 
whenever 
is in .
This shows that 
is a local minimum.

For this project we locate a trash dumpster in order to study its shape and construction. We 
then attempt to determine the dimensions of a container of similar design that minimize 
construction cost.
1. First locate a trash dumpster in your area. Carefully study and describe all details of its con-
struction, and determine its volume. Include a sketch of the container.
2. While maintaining the general shape and method of construction, determine the dimensions
such a container of the same volume should have in order to minimize the cost of construc-
tion. Use the following assumptions in your analysis:
N The sides, back, and front are to be made from 12-gauge (0.1046 inch thick) steel sheets,
which cost $0.70 per square foot (including any required cuts or bends).
N The base is to be made from a 10-gauge (0.1345 inch thick) steel sheet, which costs $0.90
per square foot.
N Lids cost approximately $50.00 each, regardless of dimensions.
N Welding costs approximately $0.18 per foot for material and labor combined.
Give justiﬁcation of any further assumptions or simpliﬁcations made of the details of 
construction.
3. Describe how any of your assumptions or simpliﬁcations may affect the ﬁnal result.
4. If you were hired as a consultant on this investigation, what would your conclusions be?
Would you recommend altering the design of the dumpster? If so, describe the savings that
would result.

The Taylor polynomial approximation to functions of one variable that we discussed in Chap-
ter 11 can be extended to functions of two or more variables. Here we investigate quadratic
approximations to functions of two variables and use them to give insight into the Second 
Derivatives Test for classifying critical points.
In Section 14.4 we discussed the linearization of a function 
of two variables at a 
point 
:
Recall that the graph of

at

corresponding linear approximation is 
. The linearization 
is also called the
ﬁrst-degree Taylor polynomial of

polynomial of

is called the quadratic approximation to

LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
In Example 6 in Section 14.7 we maximized a volume function 
subject to the
constraint 
, which expressed the side condition that the surface area
was 12 m . In this section we present Lagrange’s method for maximizing or minimizing 
a general function 
subject to a constraint (or side condition) of the form
.
It’s easier to explain the geometric basis of Lagrange’s method for functions of two
variables. So we start by trying to ﬁnd the extreme values of 
subject to a constraint
of the form 
. In other words, we seek the extreme values of 
when the
point 
is restricted to lie on the level curve 
. Figure 1 shows this curve
together with several level curves of . These have the equations
where
,
, , 
, 
. To maximize 
subject to 
is to ﬁnd the largest value of such
that the level curve 
intersects 
. It appears from Figure 1 that this
happens when these curves just touch each other, that is, when they have a common tan-
gent line. (Otherwise, the value of c could be increased further.) This means that the nor-
mal lines at the point 
where they touch are identical. So the gradient vectors are
parallel; that is, 
for some scalar .
This kind of argument also applies to the problem of ﬁnding the extreme values of
subject to the constraint 
. Thus the point 
is restricted to lie
on the level surface 
with equation 
. Instead of the level curves in Figure 1,
we consider the level surfaces 
and argue that if the maximum value of 
is 
, then the level surface 
is tangent to the level surface
and so the corresponding gradient vectors are parallel.

This intuitive argument can be made precise as follows. Suppose that a function 
has
an extreme value at a point 
on the surface 
and let 
be a curve with vector
equation 
that lies on 
and passes through . If 
is the parameter
value corresponding to the point , then 
. The composite function
represents the values that 
takes on the curve . Since 
has an
extreme value at 
, it follows that has an extreme value at , so 
. But
if 
is differentiable, we can use the Chain Rule to write
This shows that the gradient vector 
is orthogonal to the tangent vector 
to every such curve . But we already know from Section 14.6 that the gradient vector 
of , 
, is also orthogonal to 
for every such curve. (See Equation 14.6.18.)
This means that the gradient vectors 
and 
must be parallel.
Therefore, if 
, there is a number 
such that
The number 
in Equation 1 is called a Lagrange multiplier. The procedure based on
Equation 1 is as follows.
METHOD OF LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS To ﬁnd the maximum and minimum values
of 
subject to the constraint 
[assuming that these extreme
values exist and 
on the surface 
]:
(a) Find all values of , , , and 
such that
and
(b) Evaluate 
at all the points 
that result from step (a). The largest of
these values is the maximum value of ; the smallest is the minimum value 
of .
If we write the vector equation 
in terms of its components, then the equa-
tions in step (a) become
This is a system of four equations in the four unknowns , , , and , but it is not neces-
sary to ﬁnd explicit values for .
For functions of two variables the method of Lagrange multipliers is similar to the
method just described. To ﬁnd the extreme values of 
subject to the constraint
, we look for values of , , and

This amounts to solving three equations in three unknowns:
Our ﬁrst illustration of Lagrange’s method is to reconsider the problem given in
Example 6 in Section 14.7.
EXAMPLE 1 A rectangular box without a lid is to be made from 12 m of cardboard.
Find the maximum volume of such a box.
SOLUTION As in Example 6 in Section 14.7, we let , , and be the length, width, and
height, respectively, of the box in meters. Then we wish to maximize
subject to the constraint
Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we look for values of , , , and 
such that
and 
. This gives the equations
which become
There are no general rules for solving systems of equations. Sometimes some ingenuity
is required. In the present example you might notice that if we multiply (2) by 
(3) by ,
and (4) by , then the left sides of these equations will be identical. Doing this, we have
We observe that 
because 
would imply 
from (2), (3), and
(4) and this would contradict (5). Therefore, from (6) and (7), we have
which gives 
. But 
(since 
would give 
), so 
. From (7) and
(8) we have
which gives 
and so (since 
) 
. If we now put 
in (5),
we get
Since , , and are all positive, we therefore have 
and so 
and 
. This
agrees with our answer in Section 14.7.

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
N Another method for solving the system of
equations (2–5) is to solve each of Equations 2,
3, and 4 for 
and then to equate the resulting
expressions.

EXAMPLE 2 Find the extreme values of the function 
on the 
circle 
.
SOLUTION We are asked for the extreme values of 
subject to the constraint
. Using Lagrange multipliers, we solve the equations 
and 
, which can be written as
or as
From (9) we have 
or 
. If 
, then (11) gives 
. If 
, then
from (10), so then (11) gives 
. Therefore 
has possible extreme values 
at the points 
, 
, 
, and 
. Evaluating 
at these four points, we
ﬁnd that
Therefore the maximum value of 
on the circle 
is 
and the
minimum value is 
. Checking with Figure 2, we see that these values look
reasonable.

EXAMPLE 3 Find the extreme values of 
on the disk 
.
SOLUTION According to the procedure in (14.7.9), we compare the values of 
at the criti-
cal points with values at the points on the boundary. Since 
and 
, the only
critical point is 
. We compare the value of 
at that point with the extreme values
on the boundary from Example 2:
Therefore the maximum value of 
on the disk 
is 
and the
minimum value is 
.
M
EXAMPLE 4 Find the points on the sphere 
that are closest to and 
farthest from the point 
.
SOLUTION The distance from a point 
to the point 
is
but the algebra is simpler if we instead maximize and minimize the square of the 
distance:
The constraint is that the point 
lies on the sphere, that is,

Therefore, from (15), we have

APPLIED PROJECT ROCKET SCIENCE
||||
941
Many rockets, such as the Pegasus XL currently used to launch satellites and the Saturn V that
ﬁrst put men on the moon, are designed to use three stages in their ascent into space. A large ﬁrst
stage initially propels the rocket until its fuel is consumed, at which point the stage is jettisoned
to reduce the mass of the rocket. The smaller second and third stages function similarly in order
to place the rocket’s payload into orbit about the earth. (With this design, at least two stages are
required in order to reach the necessary velocities, and using three stages has proven to be a good
compromise between cost and performance.) Our goal here is to determine the individual masses
of the three stages, which are to be designed in such a way as to minimize the total mass of the
rocket while enabling it to reach a desired velocity.

mass of the rocket vehicle without fuel to the total mass of the rocket with payload), and is the
(constant) speed of exhaust relative to the rocket.
Now consider a rocket with three stages and a payload of mass . Assume that outside forces
are negligible and that and 
remain constant for each stage. If 
is the mass of the 
stage, 
we can initially consider the rocket engine to have mass 
and its payload to have mass
; the second and third stages can be handled similarly.
1. Show that the velocity attained after all three stages have been jettisoned is given by
2. We wish to minimize the total mass 
of the rocket engine subject 
to the constraint that the desired velocity 
from Problem 1 is attained. The method of
Lagrange multipliers is appropriate here, but difﬁcult to implement using the current expres-
sions. To simplify, we deﬁne variables 
so that the constraint equation may be expressed as
. Since 
is now difﬁcult to express in terms of the 
’s, we
wish to use a simpler function that will be minimized at the same place as 
. Show that
and conclude that
3. Verify that 
is minimized at the same location as 
; use Lagrange multipliers
and the results of Problem 2 to ﬁnd expressions for the values of 
where the minimum
occurs subject to the constraint 
. [Hint: Use properties of 
logarithms to help simplify the expressions.]
4. Find an expression for the minimum value of 
as a function of .
5. If we want to put a three-stage rocket into orbit 100 miles above the earth’s surface, a ﬁnal
velocity of approximately 
is required. Suppose that each stage is built with a
structural factor 
and an exhaust speed of 
.
(a) Find the minimum total mass 
of the rocket engines as a function of .
(b) Find the mass of each individual stage as a function of . (They are not equally sized!)
6. The same rocket would require a ﬁnal velocity of approximately 
in order to
escape earth’s gravity. Find the mass of each individual stage that would minimize the total
mass of the rocket engines and allow the rocket to propel a 500-pound probe into deep space.

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

The Katahdin Paper Company in Millinocket, Maine, operates a hydroelectric generating station
on the Penobscot River. Water is piped from a dam to the power station. The rate at which the
water ﬂows through the pipe varies, depending on external conditions.
The power station has three different hydroelectric turbines, each with a known (and unique)
power function that gives the amount of electric power generated as a function of the water ﬂow
arriving at the turbine. The incoming water can be apportioned in different volumes to each
turbine, so the goal is to determine how to distribute water among the turbines to give the maxi-
mum total energy production for any rate of ﬂow.
Using experimental evidence and Bernoulli’s equation, the following quadratic models were
determined for the power output of each turbine, along with the allowable ﬂows of operation:
,
,
where
1. If all three turbines are being used, we wish to determine the ﬂow 
to each turbine that will
give the maximum total energy production. Our limitations are that the ﬂows must sum to 
the total incoming ﬂow and the given domain restrictions must be observed. Consequently,
use Lagrange multipliers to ﬁnd the values for the individual ﬂows (as functions of 
) 
that maximize the total energy production 
subject to the constraints
and the domain restrictions on each 
.
2. For which values of 
is your result valid?
3. For an incoming ﬂow of 
, determine the distribution to the turbines and verify 
(by trying some nearby distributions) that your result is indeed a maximum.
4. Until now we have assumed that all three turbines are operating; is it possible in some situa-
tions that more power could be produced by using only one turbine? Make a graph of the
three power functions and use it to help decide if an incoming ﬂow of 
should be
distributed to all three turbines or routed to just one. (If you determine that only one turbine
should be used, which one would it be?) What if the ﬂow is only 
?
5. Perhaps for some ﬂow levels it would be advantageous to use two turbines. If the incoming
ﬂow is 
, which two turbines would you recommend using? Use Lagrange multi-
pliers to determine how the ﬂow should be distributed between the two turbines to maxi-
mize the energy produced. For this ﬂow, is using two turbines more efﬁcient than using all
three?
6. If the incoming ﬂow is 
, what would you recommend to the company?

In this chapter we extend the idea of a deﬁnite integral to double and triple integrals 
of functions of two or three variables. These ideas are then used to compute volumes,
masses, and centroids of more general regions than we were able to consider in
Chapters 6 and 8. We also use double integrals to calculate probabilities when two
random variables are involved.
We will see that polar coordinates are useful in computing double integrals over some
types of regions. In a similar way, we will introduce two new coordinate systems in
three-dimensional space––cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates––that
greatly simplify the computation of triple integrals over certain commonly occurring
solid regions.
A double integral of a positive function is a volume, which 
is the limit of sums of volumes of rectangular columns.

DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER RECTANGLES
In much the same way that our attempt to solve the area problem led to the deﬁnition of a
deﬁnite integral, we now seek to ﬁnd the volume of a solid and in the process we arrive at
the deﬁnition of a double integral.
REVIEW OF THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
First let’s recall the basic facts concerning deﬁnite integrals of functions of a single vari-
able. If 
is deﬁned for 
, we start by dividing the interval 
into n sub-
intervals 
of equal width 
and we choose sample points 
in these
subintervals. Then we form the Riemann sum
and take the limit of such sums as 
to obtain the deﬁnite integral of 
from 
to :
In the special case where 
, the Riemann sum can be interpreted as the sum of the
areas of the approximating rectangles in Figure 1, and 
represents the area under
the curve 
from to .
VOLUMES AND DOUBLE INTEGRALS
In a similar manner we consider a function 
of two variables deﬁned on a closed rectangle
and we ﬁrst suppose that
. The graph of f is a surface with equation
.
Let S be the solid that lies above R and under the graph of f, that is,
(See Figure 2.) Our goal is to ﬁnd the volume of S.
The ﬁrst step is to divide the rectangle 
into subrectangles. We accomplish this by
dividing the interval 
into m subintervals 
of equal width 
and dividing 
into n subintervals 
of equal width 
. By draw-

ing lines parallel to the coordinate axes through the endpoints of these subintervals, as in
Figure 3, we form the subrectangles
each with area

If we choose a sample point
in each 
, then we can approximate the part of
S that lies above each 
by a thin rectangular box (or “column”) with base 
and height
as shown in Figure 4. (Compare with Figure 1.) The volume of this box is the
height of the box times the area of the base rectangle:
If we follow this procedure for all the rectangles and add the volumes of the corresponding
boxes, we get an approximation to the total volume of S:
(See Figure 5.) This double sum means that for each subrectangle we evaluate at the cho-
sen point and multiply by the area of the subrectangle, and then we add the results.

CHAPTER 15 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

Our intuition tells us that the approximation given in (3) becomes better as 
and 
become larger and so we would expect that
We use the expression in Equation 4 to deﬁne the volume of the solid that lies under the
graph of and above the rectangle . (It can be shown that this deﬁnition is consistent with
our formula for volume in Section 6.2.)
Limits of the type that appear in Equation 4 occur frequently, not just in ﬁnding vol-
umes but in a variety of other situations as well—as we will see in Section 15.5—even
when 
is not a positive function. So we make the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION The double integral of over the rectangle 
is
if this limit exists.
The precise meaning of the limit in Deﬁnition 5 is that for every number 
there is
an integer 
such that
for all integers 
and greater than 
and for any choice of sample points 
in 
A function 
is called integrable if the limit in Deﬁnition 5 exists. It is shown in courses
on advanced calculus that all continuous functions are integrable. In fact, the double inte-
gral of 
exists provided that 
is “not too discontinuous.” In particular, if 
is bounded
[that is, there is a constant 
such that 
for all 
in ], and 
is con-
tinuous there, except on a ﬁnite number of smooth curves, then 
is integrable over .
The sample point 
can be chosen to be any point in the subrectangle 
but if
we choose it to be the upper right-hand corner of 
[namely 
, see Figure 3], then
the expression for the double integral looks simpler:
By comparing Deﬁnitions 4 and 5, we see that a volume can be written as a double
integral:
If 
, then the volume 
of the solid that lies above the rectangle 
and
below the surface

The sum in Deﬁnition 5,
is called a double Riemann sum and is used as an approximation to the value of the 
double integral. [Notice how similar it is to the Riemann sum in (1) for a function of a 
single variable.] If 
happens to be a positive function, then the double Riemann sum 
represents the sum of volumes of columns, as in Figure 5, and is an approximation to the
volume under the graph of and above the rectangle .
EXAMPLE 1 Estimate the volume of the solid that lies above the square
and below the elliptic paraboloid 
. Divide 
into four equal squares and choose the sample point to be the upper right corner of 
each square 
. Sketch the solid and the approximating rectangular boxes.
SOLUTION The squares are shown in Figure 6. The paraboloid is the graph of
and the area of each square is 1. Approximating the volume 
by the Riemann sum with 
, we have
This is the volume of the approximating rectangular boxes shown in Figure 7.
M
We get better approximations to the volume in Example 1 if we increase the number of
squares. Figure 8 shows how the columns start to look more like the actual solid and the
corresponding approximations become more accurate when we use 16, 64, and 256
squares. In the next section we will be able to show that the exact volume is 48.

SOLUTION It would be very difﬁcult to evaluate this integral directly from Deﬁnition 5 but,
because 
, we can compute the integral by interpreting it as a volume. If

volume of the solid S that lies below the circular cylinder 
and above the 
rectangle R. (See Figure 9.) The volume of S is the area of a semicircle with radius 1
times the length of the cylinder. Thus

THE MIDPOINT RULE
The methods that we used for approximating single integrals (the Midpoint Rule, the
Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule) all have counterparts for double integrals. Here we
consider only the Midpoint Rule for double integrals. This means that we use a double Rie-
mann sum to approximate the double integral, where the sample point 
in 
is
chosen to be the center 
of 
. In other words, 
is the midpoint of 
and 
is the midpoint of

In the next section we will develop an efficient method for com-
puting double integrals and then we will see that the exact value of the double integral in
Example 3 is 
. (Remember that the interpretation of a double integral as a volume is
valid only when the integrand 
is a positive function. The integrand in Example 3 is not
a positive function, so its integral is not a volume. In Examples 2 and 3 in Section 15.2 we
will discuss how to interpret integrals of functions that are not always positive in terms of
volumes.) If we keep dividing each subrectangle in Figure 10 into four smaller ones with

AVERAGE VALUE
Recall from Section 6.5 that the average value of a function 
of one variable deﬁned on
an interval 
is
In a similar fashion we deﬁne the average value of a function 
of two variables deﬁned
on a rectangle R to be
where 
is the area of R.
If

says that the box with base 
and height

describes a mountainous region and you chop off the
tops of the mountains at height 
, then you can use them to ﬁll in the valleys so that the
region becomes completely ﬂat. See Figure 11.]
EXAMPLE 4 The contour map in Figure 12 shows the snowfall, in inches, that fell on the
state of Colorado on December 20 and 21, 2006. (The state is in the shape of a rectangle
that measures 388 mi west to east and 276 mi south to north.) Use the contour map to
estimate the average snowfall for the entire state of Colorado on those days.

ITERATED INTEGRALS
Recall that it is usually difﬁcult to evaluate single integrals directly from the deﬁnition of
an integral, but the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a much easier method. The
evaluation of double integrals from ﬁrst principles is even more difﬁcult, but in this sec- 
15.2

tion we see how to express a double integral as an iterated integral, which can then be eval-
uated by calculating two single integrals.
Suppose that 
is a function of two variables that is integrable on the rectangle
. We use the notation 
to mean that 
is held ﬁxed and
is integrated with respect to 
from 
to 
. This procedure is called par-
tial integration with respect to . (Notice its similarity to partial differentiation.) Now
is a number that depends on the value of , so it deﬁnes a function of :
If we now integrate the function 
with respect to from 
to 
, we get
The integral on the right side of Equation 1 is called an iterated integral. Usually the
brackets are omitted. Thus
means that we ﬁrst integrate with respect to from to 
and then with respect to from
to .
Similarly, the iterated integral
means that we ﬁrst integrate with respect to 
(holding 
ﬁxed) from 
to 
and
then we integrate the resulting function of with respect to from 
to 
Notice
that in both Equations 2 and 3 we work from the inside out.

CHAPTER 15 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

(b) Here we ﬁrst integrate with respect to :
M
Notice that in Example 1 we obtained the same answer whether we integrated with
respect to or ﬁrst. In general, it turns out (see Theorem 4) that the two iterated integrals
in Equations 2 and 3 are always equal; that is, the order of integration does not matter.
(This is similar to Clairaut’s Theorem on the equality of the mixed partial derivatives.)
The following theorem gives a practical method for evaluating a double integral by
expressing it as an iterated integral (in either order).
FUBINI’S THEOREM If 
is continuous on the rectangle 
, 
, then
More generally, this is true if we assume that 
is bounded on , 
is discontin-
uous only on a ﬁnite number of smooth curves, and the iterated integrals exist.
The proof of Fubini’s Theorem is too difﬁcult to include in this book, but we can at least
give an intuitive indication of why it is true for the case where 
. Recall that if
is positive, then we can interpret the double integral 
as the volume 
of
the solid 
that lies above 
and under the surface 
. But we have another for-
mula that we used for volume in Chapter 6, namely,
where 
is the area of a cross-section of 
in the plane through 
perpendicular to the 
-axis. From Figure 1 you can see that 
is the area under the curve 
whose equation
is 
, where is held constant and 
. Therefore
and we have
A similar argument, using cross-sections perpendicular to the -axis as in Figure 2, shows
that

N Theorem 4 is named after the Italian mathe-

a very general version of this theorem in 1907.
But the version for continuous functions was
known to the French mathematician Augustin-

N Notice the negative answer in Example 2;
nothing is wrong with that. The function 
in
that example is not a positive function, so its
integral doesn’t represent a volume. From 
Figure 3 we see that 
is always negative on 
, so the value of the integral is the negative
of the volume that lies above the graph of

SOLUTION We ﬁrst observe that is the solid that lies under the surface

Example 1 in Section 15.1, but we are now in a position to evaluate the double integral
using Fubini’s Theorem. Therefore

In the special case where

form. To be speciﬁc, suppose that

Fubini’s Theorem gives
In the inner integral, is a constant, so

N In Example 2, Solutions 1 and 2 are equally
straightforward, but in Example 3 the ﬁrst solu-
tion is much easier than the second one. There-

DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER GENERAL REGIONS
For single integrals, the region over which we integrate is always an interval. But for 
double integrals, we want to be able to integrate a function 
not just over rectangles but
also over regions 
of more general shape, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1. We sup-
pose that 
is a bounded region, which means that 
can be enclosed in a rectangular
region 
as in Figure 2. Then we deﬁne a new function 
with domain 
by

If F is integrable over R, then we deﬁne the double integral of
over D by
Deﬁnition 2 makes sense because R is a rectangle and so 
has been previ-
ously deﬁned in Section 15.1. The procedure that we have used is reasonable because the
values of 
are 0 when 
lies outside 
and so they contribute nothing to the inte-
gral. This means that it doesn’t matter what rectangle 
we use as long as it contains .
In the case where 
, we can still interpret 
as the volume of the
solid that lies above 
and under the surface 
(the graph of ). You can see that
this is reasonable by comparing the graphs of 
and 
in Figures 3 and 4 and remember-
ing that 
is the volume under the graph of .
Figure 4 also shows that 
is likely to have discontinuities at the boundary points of 
Nonetheless, if 
is continuous on 
and the boundary curve of 
is “well behaved” 
(in a sense outside the scope of this book), then it can be shown that 
exists
and therefore 
exists. In particular, this is the case for the following types
of regions.
A plane region 
is said to be of type I if it lies between the graphs of two continuous
functions of , that is,
where 
and 
are continuous on 
. Some examples of type I regions are shown in
Figure 5.
In order to evaluate 
when 
is a region of type I, we choose a rectangle
that contains , as in Figure 6, and we let 
be the function given by
Equation 1; that is, 
agrees with 
on 
and 
is outside . Then, by Fubini’s Theorem,
Observe that

that enables us to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral.
If 
is continuous on a type I region D such that
then
The integral on the right side of (3) is an iterated integral that is similar to the ones we
considered in the preceding section, except that in the inner integral we regard as being
constant not only in 
but also in the limits of integration, 
and 
We also consider plane regions of type II, which can be expressed as 
where 
and 
are continuous. Two such regions are illustrated in Figure 7.
Using the same methods that were used in establishing (3), we can show that
where D is a type II region given by Equation 4.

SOLUTION The parabolas intersect when

note that the region , sketched in Figure 8, is a type I region but not a type II region

When we set up a double integral as in Example 1, it is essential to draw a 
diagram. Often it is helpful to draw a vertical arrow as in Figure 8. Then the limits of 
integration for the inner integral can be read from the diagram as follows: The arrow 
starts at the lower boundary 
, which gives the lower limit in the integral, and 
the arrow ends at the upper boundary 
, which gives the upper limit of integration.
For a type II region the arrow is drawn horizontally from the left boundary to the right
boundary.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid that lies under the paraboloid 
and
above the region 
in the

and the parabola 
.
SOLUTION 1 From Figure 9 we see that 
is a type I region and
Therefore the volume under 
and above 
is
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 10 we see that 
can also be written as a type II region:
Therefore another expression for

EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate 
where 
is the region bounded by the line 
and the parabola 
.
SOLUTION The region 
is shown in Figure 12. Again 
is both type I and type II, but the
description of 
as a type I region is more complicated because the lower boundary con-
sists of two parts. Therefore we prefer to express 
as a type II region:

EXAMPLE 4 Find the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by the planes 
,
,

.
SOLUTION In a question such as this, it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of the three-
dimensional solid and another of the plane region 
over which it lies. Figure 13 shows
the tetrahedron 
bounded by the coordinate planes 
, 
, the vertical plane
, and the plane 
. Since the plane 
intersects the 
-plane (whose equation is 
) in the line 
, we see that 
lies above the
triangular region 
in the 
-plane bounded by the lines 
, 
, and 
.
(See Figure 14.)
The plane 
can be written as 
, so the required volume
lies under the graph of the function 
and above

EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate the iterated integral 
.
SOLUTION If we try to evaluate the integral as it stands, we are faced with the task of ﬁrst
evaluating 
. But it’s impossible to do so in ﬁnite terms since 
is
not an elementary function. (See the end of Section 7.5.) So we must change the order 
of integration. This is accomplished by ﬁrst expressing the given iterated integral as a
double integral. Using (3) backward, we have
where
We sketch this region 
in Figure 15. Then from Figure 16 we see that an alternative
description of 
is
This enables us to use (5) to express the double integral as an iterated integral in the
reverse order:

The next property of double integrals is similar to the property of single integrals given
by the equation

If 
, where 
and 
don’t overlap except perhaps on their boundaries
(see Figure 17), then
Property 9 can be used to evaluate double integrals over regions 
that are neither type I
nor type II but can be expressed as a union of regions of type I or type II. Figure 18 illus-
trates this procedure. (See Exercises 51 and 52.)
The next property of integrals says that if we integrate the constant function 
over a region , we get the area of 
:
Figure 19 illustrates why Equation 10 is true: A solid cylinder whose base is 
and whose
height is 1 has volume 
, but we know that we can also write its volume
as 
.
Finally, we can combine Properties 7, 8, and 10 to prove the following property. (See

DOUBLE INTEGRALS IN POLAR COORDINATES
Suppose that we want to evaluate a double integral 
, where 
is one of the
regions shown in Figure 1. In either case the description of 
in terms of rectangular coor-
dinates is rather complicated but 
is easily described using polar coordinates.
Recall from Figure 2 that the polar coordinates 
of a point are related to the rect-
angular coordinates 
by the equations
(See Section 10.3.)
The regions in Figure 1 are special cases of a polar rectangle
which is shown in Figure 3. In order to compute the double integral 
, where
is a polar rectangle, we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals 
of equal
width 
and we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals 
of
equal width 
. Then the circles 
and the rays 
divide the polar
rectangle R into the small polar rectangles shown in Figure 4.

The “center” of the polar subrectangle

We compute the area of

and central angle 
is 
. Subtracting the areas of two such sectors, each of which has
central angle 
, we ﬁnd that the area of

Although we have deﬁned the double integral 
in terms of ordinary rect-
angles, it can be shown that, for continuous functions , we always obtain the same 
answer using polar rectangles. The rectangular coordinates of the center of

ten as

The formula in (2) says that we convert from rectangular to polar coordinates in a 
double integral by writing 
and 
, using the appropriate limits of 
| integration for and , and replacing 
by 
. Be careful not to forget the additional
factor r on the right side of Formula 2. A classical method for remembering this is shown
in Figure 5, where the “inﬁnitesimal” polar rectangle can be thought of as an ordinary rect-
angle with dimensions 
and 
and therefore has “area” 
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate

is the region in the upper half-plane
bounded by the circles

SOLUTION The region 
can be described as
It is the half-ring shown in Figure 1(b), and in polar coordinates it is given by
,
. Therefore, by Formula 2,

SOLUTION If we put 
in the equation of the paraboloid, we get 
. This
means that the plane intersects the paraboloid in the circle 
, so the solid 
lies under the paraboloid and above the circular disk 
given by 
[see

If we had used rectangular coordinates instead of polar coordinates, then we would have
obtained

What we have done so far can be extended to the more complicated type of region
shown in Figure 7. It’s similar to the type II rectangular regions considered in Section 15.3.
In fact, by combining Formula 2 in this section with Formula 15.3.5, we obtain the fol-
lowing formula.
If

In particular, taking

in this formula, we see

APPLICATIONS OF DOUBLE INTEGRALS
We have already seen one application of double integrals: computing volumes. Another
geometric application is ﬁnding areas of surfaces and this will be done in Section 16.6. In
this section we explore physical applications such as computing mass, electric charge, cen-
ter of mass, and moment of inertia. We will see that these physical ideas are also impor-
tant when applied to probability density functions of two random variables.
DENSITY AND MASS
In Section 8.3 we were able to use single integrals to compute moments and the center of
mass of a thin plate or lamina with constant density. But now, equipped with the double
integral, we can consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a
region 
of the 
-plane and its density (in units of mass per unit area) at a point 
in
is given by 
, where is a continuous function on . This means that
where 
and 
are the mass and area of a small rectangle that contains 
and the
limit is taken as the dimensions of the rectangle approach 0. (See Figure 1.)
To ﬁnd the total mass 
of the lamina, we divide a rectangle 
containing 
into sub-
rectangles 
of equal size (as in Figure 2) and consider 
to be 0 outside 
. If 
we choose a point 
in 
, then the mass of the part of the lamina that occupies 
is approximately 
, where 
is the area of 
. If we add all such masses, we
get an approximation to the total mass:
If we now increase the number of subrectangles, we obtain the total mass 
of the lamina
as the limiting value of the approximations:
Physicists also consider other types of density that can be treated in the same manner.
For example, if an electric charge is distributed over a region 
and the charge density (in
units of charge per unit area) is given by 
at a point 
in , then the total charge
is given by
EXAMPLE 1 Charge is distributed over the triangular region 
in Figure 3 so that the
charge density at 
is 
, measured in coulombs per square meter (Cm ).
Find the total charge.

MOMENTS AND CENTERS OF MASS
In Section 8.3 we found the center of mass of a lamina with constant density; here we con-
sider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a region 
and has den-
sity function 
. Recall from Chapter 8 that we deﬁned the moment of a particle about
an axis as the product of its mass and its directed distance from the axis. We divide 
into
small rectangles as in Figure 2. Then the mass of 
is approximately 
, so we
can approximate the moment of 
with respect to the -axis by
If we now add these quantities and take the limit as the number of subrectangles becomes
large, we obtain the moment of the entire lamina about the x-axis:
Similarly, the moment about the y-axis is 
As before, we deﬁne the center of mass 
so that 
and 
. The physi-
cal signiﬁcance is that the lamina behaves as if its entire mass is concentrated at its center
of mass. Thus the lamina balances horizontally when supported at its center of mass (see
Figure 4).
The coordinates 
of the center of mass of a lamina occupying the region

EXAMPLE 3 The density at any point on a semicircular lamina is proportional to the
distance from the center of the circle. Find the center of mass of the lamina.
SOLUTION Let’s place the lamina as the upper half of the circle 
. (See Fig-
ure 6.) Then the distance from a point 
to the center of the circle (the origin) is
. Therefore the density function is
where 
is some constant. Both the density function and the shape of the lamina suggest
that we convert to polar coordinates. Then 
and the region 
is given by

. Thus the mass of the lamina is
Both the lamina and the density function are symmetric with respect to the -axis, so the

MOMENT OF INERTIA
The moment of inertia (also called the second moment) of a particle of mass 
about an
axis is deﬁned to be 
, where is the distance from the particle to the axis. We extend
this concept to a lamina with density function 
and occupying a region 
by pro-
ceeding as we did for ordinary moments. We divide 
into small rectangles, approximate
the moment of inertia of each subrectangle about the -axis, and take the limit of the sum
as the number of subrectangles becomes large. The result is the moment of inertia of the
lamina about the x-axis:
Similarly, the moment of inertia about the y-axis is
It is also of interest to consider the moment of inertia about the origin, also called the
polar moment of inertia:

ﬁrst:
Instead of computing

In Example 4 notice that the mass of the disk is
so the moment of inertia of the disk about the origin (like a wheel about its axle) can be
written as
Thus if we increase the mass or the radius of the disk, we thereby increase the moment of
inertia. In general, the moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational motion
that mass plays in linear motion. The moment of inertia of a wheel is what makes it difﬁ-
cult to start or stop the rotation of the wheel, just as the mass of a car is what makes it dif-
ﬁcult to start or stop the motion of the car.
The radius of gyration of a lamina about an axis is the number 
such that
where 
is the mass of the lamina and 
is the moment of inertia about the given axis.
Equation 9 says that if the mass of the lamina were concentrated at a distance 
from the
axis, then the moment of inertia of this “point mass” would be the same as the moment of
inertia of the lamina.
In particular, the radius of gyration with respect to the -axis and the radius of gyra-
tion with respect to the -axis are given by the equations
Thus 
is the point at which the mass of the lamina can be concentrated without chang-
ing the moments of inertia with respect to the coordinate axes. (Note the analogy with the
center of mass.)
EXAMPLE 5 Find the radius of gyration about the -axis of the disk in Example 4.
SOLUTION As noted, the mass of the disk is 
, so from Equations 10 we have
Therefore the radius of gyration about the -axis is 
, which is half the radius of
the disk.

CHAPTER 15 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

PROBABILITY
In Section 8.5 we considered the probability density function of a continuous random
variable X. This means that 
for all x, 
, and the probability that X
lies between a and b is found by integrating f from a to b:
Now we consider a pair of continuous random variables X and Y, such as the lifetimes
of two components of a machine or the height and weight of an adult female chosen at ran-
dom. The joint density function of X and Y is a function f of two variables such that the
probability that 
lies in a region D is
In particular, if the region is a rectangle, the probability that X lies between a and b and Y
lies between c and d is
(See Figure 7.)
Because probabilities aren’t negative and are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, the joint
density function has the following properties:
As in Exercise 36 in Section 15.4, the double integral over 
is an improper integral
deﬁned as the limit of double integrals over expanding circles or squares and we can write

EXAMPLE 6 If the joint density function for X and Y is given by
ﬁnd the value of the constant C. Then ﬁnd 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁnd the value of C by ensuring that the double integral of f is equal to 1.
Because 
outside the rectangle 
, we have
Therefore 
and so 
.
Now we can compute the probability that X is at most 7 and Y is at least 2:
M
Suppose X is a random variable with probability density function 
and Y is a ran-
dom variable with density function 
. Then X and Y are called independent random
variables if their joint density function is the product of their individual density functions:
In Section 8.5 we modeled waiting times by using exponential density functions
where 
is the mean waiting time. In the next example we consider a situation with two
independent waiting times.
EXAMPLE 7 The manager of a movie theater determines that the average time movie-
goers wait in line to buy a ticket for this week’s ﬁlm is 10 minutes and the average time
they wait to buy popcorn is 5 minutes. Assuming that the waiting times are independent,
ﬁnd the probability that a moviegoer waits a total of less than 20 minutes before taking
his or her seat.
SOLUTION Assuming that both the waiting time X for the ticket purchase and the waiting
time Y in the refreshment line are modeled by exponential probability density functions,
we can write the individual density functions as

We are asked for the probability that

This means that about 75% of the moviegoers wait less than 20 minutes before taking
their seats.
M
EXPECTED VALUES
Recall from Section 8.5 that if X is a random variable with probability density function
then its mean is
Now if X and Y are random variables with joint density function f, we deﬁne the X-mean
and Y-mean, also called the expected values of X and Y, to be
Notice how closely the expressions for 
and 
in (11) resemble the moments 
and 
of a lamina with density function 
in Equations 3 and 4. In fact, we can think of proba-
bility as being like continuously distributed mass. We calculate probability the way we cal-
culate mass—by integrating a density function. And because the total “probability mass”
is 1, the expressions for and in (5) show that we can think of the expected values of X
and Y, 
and 
, as the coordinates of the “center of mass” of the probability distribution.
In the next example we deal with normal distributions. As in Section 8.5, a single ran-
dom variable is normally distributed if its probability density function is of the form
where 
is the mean and 
is the standard deviation.

EXAMPLE 8 A factory produces (cylindrically shaped) roller bearings that are sold as
having diameter 4.0 cm and length 6.0 cm. In fact, the diameters X are normally distrib-
uted with mean 4.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm while the lengths Y are normally
distributed with mean 6.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm. Assuming that X and Y are
independent, write the joint density function and graph it. Find the probability that a
bearing randomly chosen from the production line has either length or diameter that
differs from the mean by more than 0.02 cm.
SOLUTION We are given that X and Y are normally distributed with 
, 
and
. So the individual density functions for X and Y are
Since X and Y are independent, the joint density function is the product:
A graph of this function is shown in Figure 9.
Let’s ﬁrst calculate the probability that both X and Y differ from their means by less
than 0.02 cm. Using a calculator or computer to estimate the integral, we have
Then the probability that either X or Y differs from its mean by more than 0.02 cm is

TRIPLE INTEGRALS
Just as we deﬁned single integrals for functions of one variable and double integrals for
functions of two variables, so we can deﬁne triple integrals for functions of three variables.
Let’s ﬁrst deal with the simplest case where 
is deﬁned on a rectangular box:
The ﬁrst step is to divide B into sub-boxes. We do this by dividing the interval 
into
l subintervals 
of equal width 
, dividing 
into m subintervals of width 
,
and dividing 
into n subintervals of width 
. The planes through the endpoints of
these subintervals parallel to the coordinate planes divide the box 
into 
sub-boxes
which are shown in Figure 1. Each sub-box has volume 
.
Then we form the triple Riemann sum
where the sample point 
is in 
. By analogy with the deﬁnition of a double
integral (15.1.5), we deﬁne the triple integral as the limit of the triple Riemann sums in (2).
DEFINITION The triple integral of 
over the box 
is
if this limit exists.
Again, the triple integral always exists if 
is continuous. We can choose the sample
point to be any point in the sub-box, but if we choose it to be the point 
we get a
simpler-looking expression for the triple integral:
Just as for double integrals, the practical method for evaluating triple integrals is to
express them as iterated integrals as follows.

FUBINI’S THEOREM FOR TRIPLE INTEGRALS If 
is continuous on the rectan-
gular box 
, then
The iterated integral on the right side of Fubini’s Theorem means that we integrate ﬁrst
with respect to 
(keeping 
and 
ﬁxed), then we integrate with respect to 
(keeping 
ﬁxed), and ﬁnally we integrate with respect to . There are ﬁve other possible orders in
which we can integrate, all of which give the same value. For instance, if we integrate with
respect to , then , and then , we have
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate the triple integral 
, where 
is the rectangular box
given by
SOLUTION We could use any of the six possible orders of integration. If we choose to 
integrate with respect to , then , and then , we obtain
M
Now we deﬁne the triple integral over a general bounded region E in three-
dimensional space (a solid) by much the same procedure that we used for double integrals
(15.3.2). We enclose 
in a box 
of the type given by Equation 1. Then we deﬁne a 
function 
so that it agrees with 
on 
but is 0 for points in 
that are outside . By 
deﬁnition,
This integral exists if 
is continuous and the boundary of 
is “reasonably smooth.” The
triple integral has essentially the same properties as the double integral (Properties 6–9 in
Section 15.3).
We restrict our attention to continuous functions and to certain simple types of regions.
A solid region 
is said to be of type 1 if it lies between the graphs of two continuous func-
tions of and , that is,
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane as shown in Figure 2. Notice that the
upper boundary of the solid 
is the surface with equation 
, while the lower
boundary is the surface

By the same sort of argument that led to Formula 15.3.3, it can be shown that if 
is a 
type 1 region given by Equation 5, then
The meaning of the inner integral on the right side of Equation 6 is that 
and 
are held
ﬁxed, and therefore 
and 
are regarded as constants, while 
is inte-
grated with respect to .
In particular, if the projection 
of

Figure 3), then

In each of Equations 10 and 11 there may be two possible expressions for the integral
depending on whether 
is a type I or type II plane region (and corresponding to Equa-
tions 7 and 8).
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate 
, where 
is the region bounded by the parabo-
loid 
and the plane 
.
SOLUTION The solid 
is shown in Figure 9. If we regard it as a type 1 region, then we
need to consider its projection 
onto the 
-plane, which is the parabolic region in
Figure 10. (The trace of 
in the plane 
is the parabola 
.)
From 
we obtain 
, so the lower boundary surface of 
is
and the upper surface is 
. Therefore the description of 
as
a type 1 region is
and so we obtain
Although this expression is correct, it is extremely difﬁcult to evaluate. So let’s
instead consider 
as a type 3 region. As such, its projection 
onto the 
-plane is the
disk 
shown in Figure 11.
Then the left boundary of 
is the paraboloid 
and the right boundary is
the plane 
, so taking 
and 
in Equation 11, we have
Although this integral could be written as
it’s easier to convert to polar coordinates in the 
-plane: 
, 
. This

| The most difﬁcult step in evaluating a triple
integral is setting up an expression for the region
of integration (such as Equation 9 in Example 2).
Remember that the limits of integration in the
inner integral contain at most two variables, the
limits of integration in the middle integral con-
tain at most one variable, and the limits of inte-
gration in the outer integral must be constants.

APPLICATIONS OF TRIPLE INTEGRALS
Recall that if 
, then the single integral 
represents the area under the
curve 
from to , and if 
, then the double integral 
rep-
resents the volume under the surface 
and above 
. The corresponding inter-
pretation of a triple integral 
, where 
, is not very useful
because it would be the “hypervolume” of a four-dimensional object and, of course, that
is very difﬁcult to visualize. (Remember that 
is just the domain of the function ; the
graph of 
lies in four-dimensional space.) Nonetheless, the triple integral 
can be interpreted in different ways in different physical situations, depending on the phys-
ical interpretations of , , and 
.
Let’s begin with the special case where 
for all points in . Then the triple
integral does represent the volume of :
For example, you can see this in the case of a type 1 region by putting 
in
Formula 6:
and from Section 15.3 we know this represents the volume that lies between the surfaces
and 
.
EXAMPLE 4 Use a triple integral to ﬁnd the volume of the tetrahedron 
bounded by the
planes 
, 
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION The tetrahedron 
and its projection 
on the 
-plane are shown in Figures 12
and 13. The lower boundary of 
is the plane 
and the upper boundary is the plane
, that is, 
.
Therefore we have
by the same calculation as in Example 4 in Section 15.3.

(Notice that it is not necessary to use triple integrals to compute volumes. They 
simply give an alternative method for setting up the calculation.)
M
All the applications of double integrals in Section 15.5 can be immediately extended to
triple integrals. For example, if the density function of a solid object that occupies the
region 
is 
, in units of mass per unit volume, at any given point 
, then its
mass is
and its moments about the three coordinate planes are
The center of mass is located at the point 
, where
If the density is constant, the center of mass of the solid is called the centroid of . The
moments of inertia about the three coordinate axes are
As in Section 15.5, the total electric charge on a solid object occupying a region 
and
having charge density 
is
If we have three continuous random variables X, Y, and Z, their joint density function
is a function of three variables such that the probability that 
lies in E is
In particular,

TRIPLE INTEGRALS IN CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES
In plane geometry the polar coordinate system is used to give a convenient description of
certain curves and regions. (See Section 10.3.) Figure 1 enables us to recall the connection
between polar and Cartesian coordinates. If the point 
has Cartesian coordinates 
and polar coordinates 
, then, from the ﬁgure,
In three dimensions there is a coordinate system, called cylindrical coordinates, that is
similar to polar coordinates and gives convenient descriptions of some commonly occur-
ring surfaces and solids. As we will see, some triple integrals are much easier to evaluate
in cylindrical coordinates.

CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES
In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point 
in three-dimensional space is represented
by the ordered triple 
, where 
and 
are polar coordinates of the projection of 
onto the 
-plane and 
is the directed distance from the 
-plane to . (See Figure 2.)
To convert from cylindrical to rectangular coordinates, we use the equations
whereas to convert from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates, we use
EXAMPLE 1
(a) Plot the point with cylindrical coordinates 
and ﬁnd its rectangular 
coordinates.
(b) Find cylindrical coordinates of the point with rectangular coordinates 
.
SOLUTION
(a) The point with cylindrical coordinates 
is plotted in Figure 3. From
Equations 1, its rectangular coordinates are
Thus the point is 
in rectangular coordinates.
(b) From Equations 2 we have
so
Therefore one set of cylindrical coordinates is 
. Another is
. As with polar coordinates, there are inﬁnitely many choices.
M
Cylindrical coordinates are useful in problems that involve symmetry about an axis, and
the -axis is chosen to coincide with this axis of symmetry. For instance, the axis of the
circular cylinder with Cartesian equation 
is the -axis. In cylindrical coordi-
nates this cylinder has the very simple equation 
. (See Figure 4.) This is the reason 
for the name “cylindrical” coordinates.

EXAMPLE 2 Describe the surface whose equation in cylindrical coordinates is 
.
SOLUTION The equation says that the -value, or height, of each point on the surface is the
same as r, the distance from the point to the -axis. Because 
doesn’t appear, it can
vary. So any horizontal trace in the plane 
is a circle of radius k. These
traces suggest that the surface is a cone. This prediction can be conﬁrmed by converting
the equation into rectangular coordinates. From the ﬁrst equation in (2) we have
We recognize the equation 
(by comparison with Table 1 in Section 12.6) as
being a circular cone whose axis is the -axis. (See Figure 5.)
M
EVALUATING TRIPLE INTEGRALS WITH CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES
Suppose that 
is a type 1 region whose projection 
on the 
-plane is conveniently
described in polar coordinates (see Figure 6). In particular, suppose that 
is continuous
and
where 
is given in polar coordinates by
We know from Equation 15.6.6 that
But we also know how to evaluate double integrals in polar coordinates. In fact, combin-
ing Equation 3 with Equation 15.4.3, we obtain
Formula 4 is the formula for triple integration in cylindrical coordinates. It says that
we convert a triple integral from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates by writing
, 
, leaving as it is, using the appropriate limits of integration for ,
, and , and replacing 
by 
. (Figure 7 shows how to remember this.) It is
worthwhile to use this formula when 
is a solid region easily described in cylindrical
coordinates, and especially when the function 
involves the expression 
.
EXAMPLE 3 A solid 
lies within the cylinder 
, below the plane 
,
and above the paraboloid 
. (See Figure 8.) The density at any point is
proportional to its distance from the axis of the cylinder. Find the mass of .

SOLUTION In cylindrical coordinates the cylinder is 
and the paraboloid is 
,
so we can write
Since the density at 
is proportional to the distance from the -axis, the density
function is
where

of

is the cone 
and its upper surface is the plane 
. (See Figure 9.)
This region has a much simpler description in cylindrical coordinates:

TRIPLE INTEGRALS IN SPHERICAL COORDINATES
Another useful coordinate system in three dimensions is the spherical coordinate system.
It simpliﬁes the evaluation of triple integrals over regions bounded by spheres or cones.
SPHERICAL COORDINATES
The spherical coordinates
of a point 
in space are shown in Figure 1, where
is the distance from the origin to , 
is the same angle as in cylindrical coor-
dinates, and 
is the angle between the positive -axis and the line segment 
. Note that

The ﬁgure shows the solid enclosed by three circular cylinders with the same diameter that inter-
sect at right angles. In this project we compute its volume and determine how its shape changes if
the cylinders have different diameters.
1. Sketch carefully the solid enclosed by the three cylinders 
, 
, and
. Indicate the positions of the coordinate axes and label the faces with the equa-
tions of the corresponding cylinders.
2. Find the volume of the solid in Problem 1.
3. Use a computer algebra system to draw the edges of the solid.
4. What happens to the solid in Problem 1 if the radius of the ﬁrst cylinder is different from 1?
Illustrate with a hand-drawn sketch or a computer graph.

The spherical coordinate system is especially useful in problems where there is symmetry
about a point, and the origin is placed at this point. For example, the sphere with center the
origin and radius has the simple equation 
(see Figure 2); this is the reason for the
name “spherical” coordinates. The graph of the equation 
is a vertical half-plane (see
Figure 3), and the equation 
represents a half-cone with the -axis as its axis (see
Figure 4).
The relationship between rectangular and spherical coordinates can be seen from Fig-
ure 5. From triangles 
and 
we have
But 
and 
, so to convert from spherical to rectangular coordinates,
we use the equations
Also, the distance formula shows that
We use this equation in converting from rectangular to spherical coordinates.
EXAMPLE 1 The point 
is given in spherical coordinates. Plot the point
and ﬁnd its rectangular coordinates.
SOLUTION We plot the point in Figure 6. From Equations 1 we have
Thus the point 
is 
in rectangular coordinates.

EVALUATING TRIPLE INTEGRALS WITH SPHERICAL COORDINATES
In the spherical coordinate system the counterpart of a rectangular box is a spherical
wedge
where 
, 
, and 
. Although we deﬁned triple integrals by divid-
ing solids into small boxes, it can be shown that dividing a solid into small spherical
wedges always gives the same result. So we divide 
into smaller spherical wedges
by
means of equally spaced spheres 
, half-planes 
, and half-cones 
.
Figure 7 shows that 
is approximately a rectangular box with dimensions 
, 
(arc
of a circle with radius 
angle 
), and 
(arc of a circle with radius 
angle 
). So an approximation to the volume of 
is given by
In fact, it can be shown, with the aid of the Mean Value Theorem (Exercise 45), that the
volume of 
is given exactly by
where 
is some point in 
. Let 
be the rectangular coordinates of
this point. Then
But this sum is a Riemann sum for the function
Consequently, we have arrived at the following formula for triple integration in spherical
coordinates.

Formula 3 says that we convert a triple integral from rectangular coordinates to spher-
ical coordinates by writing
using the appropriate limits of integration, and replacing 
by 
. This is
illustrated in Figure 8.
This formula can be extended to include more general spherical regions such as
In this case the formula is the same as in (3) except that the limits of integration for 
are
and 
.
Usually, spherical coordinates are used in triple integrals when surfaces such as cones
and spheres form the boundary of the region of integration.
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate 
where 
is the unit ball:
SOLUTION Since the boundary of 
is a sphere, we use spherical coordinates:
In addition, spherical coordinates are appropriate because
Thus (3) gives
M
It would have been extremely awkward to evaluate the integral in Example 3
without spherical coordinates. In rectangular coordinates the iterated integral would have

CHAPTER 15 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
Suppose that a solid ball (a marble), a hollow ball (a squash ball), a solid cylinder (a steel bar),
and a hollow cylinder (a lead pipe) roll down a slope. Which of these objects reaches the bottom
ﬁrst? (Make a guess before proceeding.)
To answer this question, we consider a ball or cylinder with mass , radius , and moment of
inertia (about the axis of rotation). If the vertical drop is , then the potential energy at the top
is 
. Suppose the object reaches the bottom with velocity and angular velocity , so 
.
The kinetic energy at the bottom consists of two parts: 
from translation (moving down the
slope) and 
from rotation. If we assume that energy loss from rolling friction is negligible,
then conservation of energy gives

CHANGE OF VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
In one-dimensional calculus we often use a change of variable (a substitution) to simplify
an integral. By reversing the roles of and , we can write the Substitution Rule (5.5.6) as
where

A change of variables can also be useful in double integrals. We have already seen one
example of this: conversion to polar coordinates. The new variables and 
are related to
the old variables and by the equations
and the change of variables formula (15.4.2) can be written as
where 
is the region in the 
-plane that corresponds to the region 
in the
-plane.
More generally, we consider a change of variables that is given by a transformation
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane:
where and are related to 
and by the equations
or, as we sometimes write,
We usually assume that 
is a C transformation, which means that and have contin-
uous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives.
A transformation 
is really just a function whose domain and range are both subsets
of
. If
, then the point
is called the image of the point
.
If no two points have the same image, 
is called one-to-one. Figure 1 shows the effect of
a transformation 
on a region 
in the 
-plane. 
transforms 
into a region 
in the 
-plane called the image of S, consisting of the images of all points in .
If 
is a one-to-one transformation, then it has an inverse transformation
from the
-plane to the 
-plane and it may be possible to solve Equations 3 for 
and in terms
of and :
EXAMPLE 1 A transformation is deﬁned by the equations

Now let’s see how a change of variables affects a double integral. We start with a small
rectangle 
in the 
-plane whose lower left corner is the point 
and whose dimen-
sions are

The image of

at 
to this image curve is

to the image curve of the left side of

We can approximate the image region 
by a parallelogram determined by the
secant vectors
shown in Figure 4. But
and so
Similarly
This means that we can approximate R by a parallelogram determined by the vectors
and

of this parallelogram, which, from Section 12.4, is

N The Jacobian is named after the German
mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi
(1804–1851). Although the French mathematician
Cauchy ﬁrst used these special determinants
involving partial derivatives, Jacobi developed
them into a method for evaluating multiple 
integrals.

Next we divide a region in the 
-plane into rectangles 
and call their images in the
-plane 
. (See Figure 6.)
Applying the approximation (8) to each 
we approximate the double integral of 
over 
as follows:
where the Jacobian is evaluated at 
. Notice that this double sum is a Riemann sum
for the integral
The foregoing argument suggests that the following theorem is true. (A full proof is
given in books on advanced calculus.)
CHANGE OF VARIABLES IN A DOUBLE INTEGRAL Suppose that 
is a 
trans-
formation whose Jacobian is nonzero and that maps a region 
in the 
-plane onto
a region 
in the 
-plane. Suppose that 
is continuous on 
and that 
and 
are
type I or type II plane regions. Suppose also that 
is one-to-one, except perhaps
on the boundary of . Then
Theorem 9 says that we change from an integral in and to an integral in and by
expressing and in terms of and and writing
Notice the similarity between Theorem 9 and the one-dimensional formula in Equation 2.
Instead of the derivative

CHAPTER 15 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

As a ﬁrst illustration of Theorem 9, we show that the formula for integration in polar
coordinates is just a special case. Here the transformation 
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane is given by
and the geometry of the transformation is shown in Figure 7. 
maps an ordinary rectangle
in the 
-plane to a polar rectangle in the 
-plane. The Jacobian of 
is
Thus Theorem 9 gives
which is the same as Formula 15.4.2.
EXAMPLE 2 Use the change of variables 
, 
to evaluate the integral
, where 
is the region bounded by the -axis and the parabolas 
and 
, 
.
SOLUTION The region 
is pictured in Figure 2 (on page 1014). In Example 1 we discov-
ered that 
, where 
is the square 
. Indeed, the reason for making
the change of variables to evaluate the integral is that 
is a much simpler region than .
First we need to compute the Jacobian:

Example 2 was not a very difﬁcult problem to solve because we were given a
suitable change of variables. If we are not supplied with a transformation, then the ﬁrst step
is to think of an appropriate change of variables. If 
is difﬁcult to integrate, then the
form of 
may suggest a transformation. If the region of integration 
is awkward,
then the transformation should be chosen so that the corresponding region in the 
-plane
has a convenient description.
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate the integral 
, where 
is the trapezoidal region with
vertices 
, 
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION Since it isn’t easy to integrate 
, we make a change of variables sug-
gested by the form of this function:
These equations deﬁne a transformation 
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane. 
Theorem 9 talks about a transformation 
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane. It is
obtained by solving Equations 10 for and :
The Jacobian of 
is
To ﬁnd the region 
in the 
-plane corresponding to , we note that the sides of 
lie on
the lines
and, from either Equations 10 or Equations 11, the image lines in the 
-plane are
Thus the region 
is the trapezoidal region with vertices

TRIPLE INTEGRALS
There is a similar change of variables formula for triple integrals. Let 
be a transfor-
mation that maps a region 
in 
-space onto a region 
in 
-space by means of the
equations
The Jacobian of 
is the following 
determinant:
Under hypotheses similar to those in Theorem 9, we have the following formula for triple
integrals:
EXAMPLE 4 Use Formula 13 to derive the formula for triple integration in spherical
coordinates.
SOLUTION Here the change of variables is given by
We compute the Jacobian as follows:
Since 
, we have 
. Therefore
and Formula 13 gives
which is equivalent to Formula 15.8.3.

In this chapter we study the calculus of vector ﬁelds. (These are functions that assign
vectors to points in space.) In particular we deﬁne line integrals (which can be used to
ﬁnd the work done by a force ﬁeld in moving an object along a curve). Then we deﬁne
surface integrals (which can be used to ﬁnd the rate of ﬂuid ﬂow across a surface). The
connections between these new types of integrals and the single, double, and triple
integrals that we have already met are given by the higher-dimensional versions of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the
Divergence Theorem.
Parametric equations enable us to plot surfaces with 
strange and beautiful shapes.

VECTOR FIELDS
The vectors in Figure 1 are air velocity vectors that indicate the wind speed and direction
at points 10 m above the surface elevation in the San Francisco Bay area. (Notice that the
wind patterns on consecutive days are quite different.) Associated with every point in the
air we can imagine a wind velocity vector. This is an example of a velocity vector ﬁeld.
Other examples of velocity vector ﬁelds are illustrated in Figure 2: ocean currents and
ﬂow past an airfoil.
Another type of vector ﬁeld, called a force ﬁeld, associates a force vector with each
point in a region. An example is the gravitational force ﬁeld that we will look at in 
Example 4.

In general, a vector ﬁeld is a function whose domain is a set of points in 
(or 
) and
whose range is a set of vectors in 
(or 
).
DEFINITION Let 
be a set in 
(a plane region). A vector ﬁeld on 
is a
function 
that assigns to each point 
in 
a two-dimensional vector 
.
The best way to picture a vector ﬁeld is to draw the arrow representing the vector 
starting at the point 
. Of course, it’s impossible to do this for all points 
, but we
can gain a reasonable impression of 
by doing it for a few representative points in 
as
in Figure 3. Since 
is a two-dimensional vector, we can write it in terms of its com-
ponent functions
and 
as follows:
or, for short,
Notice that 
and 
are scalar functions of two variables and are sometimes called scalar
ﬁelds to distinguish them from vector ﬁelds.
DEFINITION Let 
be a subset of 
. A vector ﬁeld on
is a function 
that
assigns to each point 
in 
a three-dimensional vector 
.
A vector ﬁeld 
on 
is pictured in Figure 4. We can express it in terms of its compo-
nent functions , , and 
as
As with the vector functions in Section 13.1, we can deﬁne continuity of vector ﬁelds 
and show that 
is continuous if and only if its component functions , 
, and 
are 
continuous.
We sometimes identify a point 
with its position vector 
and write
instead of 
. Then 
becomes a function that assigns a vector 
to a vec-
tor .
EXAMPLE 1 A vector ﬁeld on 
is deﬁned by 
. Describe 
by
sketching some of the vectors 
as in Figure 3.
SOLUTION Since 
, we draw the vector 
starting at the point 
in
Figure 5. Since 
, we draw the vector 
with starting point 
.
Continuing in this way, we calculate several other representative values of 
in the
table and draw the corresponding vectors to represent the vector ﬁeld in Figure 5.
It appears from Figure 5 that each arrow is tangent to a circle with center the origin.

To conﬁrm this, we take the dot product of the position vector 
with the
vector 
:
This shows that 
is perpendicular to the position vector 
and is therefore
tangent to a circle with center the origin and radius 
. Notice also that
so the magnitude of the vector 
is equal to the radius of the circle.
M
Some computer algebra systems are capable of plotting vector ﬁelds in two or three
dimensions. They give a better impression of the vector ﬁeld than is possible by hand
because the computer can plot a large number of representative vectors. Figure 6 shows a
computer plot of the vector ﬁeld in Example 1; Figures 7 and 8 show two other vector
ﬁelds. Notice that the computer scales the lengths of the vectors so they are not too long
and yet are proportional to their true lengths.
EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the vector ﬁeld on 
given by 
.
SOLUTION The sketch is shown in Figure 9. Notice that all vectors are vertical and point
upward above the 
-plane or downward below it. The magnitude increases with the 
distance from the 
-plane.
M
We were able to draw the vector ﬁeld in Example 2 by hand because of its particularly
simple formula. Most three-dimensional vector ﬁelds, however, are virtually impossible to

sketch by hand and so we need to resort to a computer algebra system. Examples are
shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12. Notice that the vector ﬁelds in Figures 10 and 11 have simi-
lar formulas, but all the vectors in Figure 11 point in the general direction of the negative
y-axis because their y-components are all 2. If the vector ﬁeld in Figure 12 represents a
velocity ﬁeld, then a particle would be swept upward and would spiral around the -axis in
the clockwise direction as viewed from above.
EXAMPLE 3 Imagine a ﬂuid ﬂowing steadily along a pipe and let 
be the 
velocity vector at a point 
. Then 
assigns a vector to each point 
in a
certain domain 
(the interior of the pipe) and so 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
called a
velocity ﬁeld. A possible velocity ﬁeld is illustrated in Figure 13. The speed at any given
point is indicated by the length of the arrow.
Velocity ﬁelds also occur in other areas of physics. For instance, the vector ﬁeld in
Example 1 could be used as the velocity ﬁeld describing the counterclockwise rotation of
a wheel. We have seen other examples of velocity ﬁelds in Figures 1 and 2.
M
EXAMPLE 4 Newton’s Law of Gravitation states that the magnitude of the gravitational
force between two objects with masses 
and 
is
where is the distance between the objects and 
is the gravitational constant. (This 
is an example of an inverse square law.) Let’s assume that the object with mass 
is 
located at the origin in 
. (For instance, 
could be the mass of the earth and the origin
would be at its center.) Let the position vector of the object with mass
be
.
Then 
, so 
. The gravitational force exerted on this second object acts
toward the origin, and the unit vector in this direction is
Therefore the gravitational force acting on the object at 
is

Formula 3 written in the form 
.] The function given by Equation 3 is
an example of a vector ﬁeld, called the gravitational ﬁeld, because it associates a vector
[the force 
] with every point 
in space.
Formula 3 is a compact way of writing the gravitational ﬁeld, but we can also write 
it in terms of its component functions by using the facts that
and
:
The gravitational ﬁeld 
is pictured in Figure 14.

EXAMPLE 5 Suppose an electric charge 
is located at the origin. According to
Coulomb’s Law, the electric force 
exerted by this charge on a charge located at 
a point 
with position vector 
is
where is a constant (that depends on the units used). For like charges, we have 
and the force is repulsive; for unlike charges, we have 
and the force is attractive.
Notice the similarity between Formulas 3 and 4. Both vector ﬁelds are examples of force
ﬁelds.
Instead of considering the electric force , physicists often consider the force per unit
charge:
Then 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
called the electric ﬁeld of .

Therefore

and is called a gradient vector ﬁeld. Likewise,
if 
is a scalar function of three variables, its gradient is a vector ﬁeld on 
given by

vector ﬁeld together with a contour map of f. How are they related?
SOLUTION The gradient vector ﬁeld is given by
Figure 15 shows a contour map of 
with the gradient vector ﬁeld. Notice that the gradi-
ent vectors are perpendicular to the level curves, as we would expect from Section 14.6.

Notice also that the gradient vectors are long where the level curves are close to each
other and short where the curves are farther apart. That’s because the length of the gradi-
ent vector is the value of the directional derivative of 
and closely spaced level curves
indicate a steep graph.
M
A vector ﬁeld 
is called a conservative vector ﬁeld if it is the gradient of some scalar
function, that is, if there exists a function 
such that 
. In this situation 
is called
a potential function for .
Not all vector ﬁelds are conservative, but such ﬁelds do arise frequently in physics. For
example, the gravitational ﬁeld F in Example 4 is conservative because if we deﬁne
then
In Sections 16.3 and 16.5 we will learn how to tell whether or not a given vector ﬁeld is
conservative.

lines.

LINE INTEGRALS
In this section we deﬁne an integral that is similar to a single integral except that instead
of integrating over an interval 
, we integrate over a curve . Such integrals are called
line integrals, although “curve integrals” would be better terminology. They were invented
in the early 19th century to solve problems involving ﬂuid ﬂow, forces, electricity, and
magnetism.
We start with a plane curve 
given by the parametric equations
or, equivalently, by the vector equation 
, and we assume that 
is a
smooth curve. [This means that 
is continuous and 
. See Section 13.3.] If we
divide the parameter interval 
into n subintervals 
of equal width and we let
and 
, then the corresponding points 
divide 
into 
subarcs
with lengths 
(See Figure 1.) We choose any point 
in the th
subarc. (This corresponds to a point 
in 
.) Now if 
is any function of two vari-
ables whose domain includes the curve , we evaluate 
at the point 
, multiply by
the length 
of the subarc, and form the sum
which is similar to a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit of these sums and make the fol-
lowing deﬁnition by analogy with a single integral.
DEFINITION If 
is deﬁned on a smooth curve 
given by Equations 1, then
the line integral of f along C is
if this limit exists.
In Section 10.2 we found that the length of 
is
A similar type of argument can be used to show that if 
is a continuous function, then the
limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists and the following formula can be used to evaluate the
line integral:
The value of the line integral does not depend on the parametrization of the curve, pro-
vided that the curve is traversed exactly once as t increases from a to b.

If

So the way to remember Formula 3 is to express everything in terms of the parameter 
Use the parametric equations to express and in terms of t and write ds as
In the special case where 
is the line segment that joins 
to 
, using as the
parameter, we can write the parametric equations of 
as follows: 
, 
,
. Formula 3 then becomes
and so the line integral reduces to an ordinary single integral in this case.
Just as for an ordinary single integral, we can interpret the line integral of a positive
function as an area. In fact, if 
, 
represents the area of one side of
the “fence” or “curtain” in Figure 2, whose base is 
and whose height above the point
is 
.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where 
is the upper half of the unit circle
.
SOLUTION In order to use Formula 3, we ﬁrst need parametric equations to represent C.
Recall that the unit circle can be parametrized by means of the equations
and the upper half of the circle is described by the parameter interval 
(See Figure 3.) Therefore Formula 3 gives
M
Suppose now that 
is a piecewise-smooth curve; that is, 
is a union of a ﬁnite num-
ber of smooth curves 
where, as illustrated in Figure 4, the initial point of
is the terminal point of

along 
as the sum of the
integrals of 
along each of the smooth pieces of :

Any physical interpretation of a line integral 
depends on the physical inter-
pretation of the function . Suppose that 
represents the linear density at a point
of a thin wire shaped like a curve . Then the mass of the part of the wire from 
to 
in Figure 1 is approximately 
and so the total mass of the wire is approx-
imately 
. By taking more and more points on the curve, we obtain the mass
of the wire as the limiting value of these approximations:
[For example, if 
represents the density of a semicircular wire, then the
integral in Example 1 would represent the mass of the wire.] The center of mass of the
wire with density function 
is located at the point 
, where
Other physical interpretations of line integrals will be discussed later in this chapter.
EXAMPLE 3 A wire takes the shape of the semicircle 
, 
, and is
thicker near its base than near the top. Find the center of mass of the wire if the linear
density at any point is proportional to its distance from the line 
.
SOLUTION As in Example 1 we use the parametrization 
,

and ﬁnd that

Two other line integrals are obtained by replacing 
by either 
or
in Deﬁnition 2. They are called the line integrals of 
along 
with
respect to x and y:
When we want to distinguish the original line integral 
from those in Equa-
tions 5 and 6, we call it the line integral with respect to arc length.
The following formulas say that line integrals with respect to 
and 
can also be 
evaluated by expressing everything in terms of : 
, 
, 
,
.
It frequently happens that line integrals with respect to 
and 
occur together. When
this happens, it’s customary to abbreviate by writing
When we are setting up a line integral, sometimes the most difﬁcult thing is to think of
a parametric representation for a curve whose geometric description is given. In particular,
we often need to parametrize a line segment, so it’s useful to remember that a vector rep-

Notice that we got different answers in parts (a) and (b) of Example 4 even though the
two curves had the same endpoints. Thus, in general, the value of a line integral depends
not just on the endpoints of the curve but also on the path. (But see Section 16.3 for con-
ditions under which the integral is independent of the path.)
Notice also that the answers in Example 4 depend on the direction, or orientation, of the
curve. If

In general, a given parametrization 
, 
, 
, determines an orien-
tation of a curve , with the positive direction corresponding to increasing values of the
parameter 
(See Figure 8, where the initial point 
corresponds to the parameter value 
and the terminal point 
corresponds to 
.)
If 
denotes the curve consisting of the same points as 
but with the opposite ori-
entation (from initial point 
to terminal point 
in Figure 8), then we have
But if we integrate with respect to arc length, the value of the line integral does not change
when we reverse the orientation of the curve:
This is because 
is always positive, whereas 
and 
change sign when we reverse
the orientation of .
LINE INTEGRALS IN SPACE
We now suppose that 
is a smooth space curve given by the parametric equations
or by a vector equation 
. If 
is a function of three variables
that is continuous on some region containing 
, then we deﬁne the line integral of
along 
(with respect to arc length) in a manner similar to that for plane curves:
We evaluate it using a formula similar to Formula 3:
Observe that the integrals in both Formulas 3 and 9 can be written in the more compact
vector notation
For the special case 
, we get

LINE INTEGRALS OF VECTOR FIELDS
Recall from Section 6.4 that the work done by a variable force 
in moving a particle
from 
to 
along the -axis is 
. Then in Section 12.3 we found that the
work done by a constant force 
in moving an object from a point
to another point 
in
space is 
, where 
l is the displacement vector.
Now suppose that 
is a continuous force ﬁeld on 
, such as the
gravitational ﬁeld of Example 4 in Section 16.1 or the electric force ﬁeld of Example 5 in
Section 16.1. (A force ﬁeld on 
could be regarded as a special case where 
and 
and 
depend only on and .) We wish to compute the work done by this force in mov-
ing a particle along a smooth curve .
We divide 
into subarcs 
with lengths 
by dividing the parameter interval
into subintervals of equal width. (See Figure 1 for the two-dimensional case or 
Figure 11 for the three-dimensional case.) Choose a point 
on the th subarc
corresponding to the parameter value 
. If 
is small, then as the particle moves from
to 
along the curve, it proceeds approximately in the direction of 
, the unit tan-
gent vector at 
. Thus the work done by the force 
in moving the particle from 
to
is approximately
and the total work done in moving the particle along 
is approximately
where 
is the unit tangent vector at the point 
on . Intuitively, we see that
these approximations ought to become better as becomes larger. Therefore we deﬁne the
work
done by the force ﬁeld 
as the limit of the Riemann sums in (11), namely,
Equation 12 says that work is the line integral with respect to arc length of the tangential
component of the force.
If the curve 
is given by the vector equation 
, then
, so using Equation 9 we can rewrite Equation 12 in the form

This integral is often abbreviated as 
and occurs in other areas of physics as well.
Therefore we make the following deﬁnition for the line integral of any continuous vector
ﬁeld.

given by a vector function 
, 
. Then the line integral of 
along C is
When using Definition 13, remember that

simply by putting

Finally, we note the connection between line integrals of vector ﬁelds and line integrals
of scalar ﬁelds. Suppose the vector ﬁeld 
on 
is given in component form by the equa-
tion 
. We use Deﬁnition 13 to compute its line integral along :
But this last integral is precisely the line integral in (10). Therefore we have

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM FOR LINE INTEGRALS
Recall from Section 5.3 that Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be writ-
ten as
where 
is continuous on 
. We also called Equation 1 the Net Change Theorem: The
integral of a rate of change is the net change.
If we think of the gradient vector 
of a function 
of two or three variables as a sort
of derivative of , then the following theorem can be regarded as a version of the Funda-
mental Theorem for line integrals.
THEOREM Let
be a smooth curve given by the vector function
,
.
Let 
be a differentiable function of two or three variables whose gradient vector
is continuous on . Then
Theorem 2 says that we can evaluate the line integral of a conservative vector
ﬁeld (the gradient vector ﬁeld of the potential function ) simply by knowing the value of
at the endpoints of 
. In fact, Theorem 2 says that the line integral of 
is the net
change in f. If 
is a function of two variables and 
is a plane curve with initial point
and terminal point 
, as in Figure 1, then Theorem 2 becomes
If 
is a function of three variables and 
is a space curve joining the point 
to the point 
, then we have
Let’s prove Theorem 2 for this case.

PROOF OF THEOREM 2
Using Deﬁnition 16.2.13, we have
(by the Chain Rule)
The last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Equation 1).
M
Although we have proved Theorem 2 for smooth curves, it is also true for piecewise-
smooth curves. This can be seen by subdividing 
into a ﬁnite number of smooth curves
and adding the resulting integrals.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the work done by the gravitational ﬁeld
in moving a particle with mass 
from the point 
to the point 
along a
piecewise-smooth curve . (See Example 4 in Section 16.1.)
SOLUTION From Section 16.1 we know that 
is a conservative vector ﬁeld and, in fact,
, where
Therefore, by Theorem 2, the work done is

INDEPENDENCE OF PATH
Suppose 
and 
are two piecewise-smooth curves (which are called paths) that have the
same initial point 
and terminal point . We know from Example 4 in Section 16.2 that,
in general, 
. But one implication of Theorem 2 is that
whenever 
is continuous. In other words, the line integral of a conservative vector ﬁeld
depends only on the initial point and terminal point of a curve.
In general, if 
is a continuous vector ﬁeld with domain , we say that the line integral
is independent of path if 
for any two paths

that have the same initial and terminal points. With this terminology we can say that line
integrals of conservative vector ﬁelds are independent of path.
A curve is called closed if its terminal point coincides with its initial point, that is,
. (See Figure 2.) If 
is independent of path in 
and 
is any closed
path in , we can choose any two points 
and 
on 
and regard 
as being composed
of the path 
from 
to 
followed by the path 
from 
to . (See Figure 3.) Then
since 
and 
have the same initial and terminal points.
Conversely, if it is true that 
whenever 
is a closed path in 
, then we
demonstrate independence of path as follows. Take any two paths 
and 
from 
to 
in 
and deﬁne 
to be the curve consisting of 
followed by 
. Then
and so 
. Thus we have proved the following theorem.
THEOREM
is independent of path in 
if and only if 
for
every closed path 
in .
Since we know that the line integral of any conservative vector ﬁeld 
is independent
of path, it follows that 
for any closed path. The physical interpretation is that
the work done by a conservative force ﬁeld (such as the gravitational or electric ﬁeld in
Section 16.1) as it moves an object around a closed path is 0.
The following theorem says that the only vector ﬁelds that are independent of path are
conservative. It is stated and proved for plane curves, but there is a similar version for
space curves. We assume that 
is open, which means that for every point 
in 
there is
a disk with center 
that lies entirely in 
. (So 
doesn’t contain any of its boundary
points.) In addition, we assume that 
is connected. This means that any two points in 
can be joined by a path that lies in .
THEOREM Suppose 
is a vector ﬁeld that is continuous on an open connected
region . If 
is independent of path in , then 
is a conservative vector
ﬁeld on 
; that is, there exists a function 
such that 
.
PROOF
Let 
be a ﬁxed point in . We construct the desired potential function 
by
deﬁning
for any point 
in . Since 
is independent of path, it does not matter 
which path 
from 
to 
is used to evaluate 
. Since 
is open, there
exists a disk contained in 
with center 
. Choose any point 
in the disk with
and let 
consist of any path 
from 
to 
followed by the horizontal
line segment 
from 
to 
. (See Figure 4.) Then

The question remains: How is it possible to determine whether or not a vector ﬁeld 
is conservative? Suppose it is known that 
is conservative, where 
and 
have continuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives. Then there is a function 
such that 
, that is,
Therefore, by Clairaut’s Theorem,

The converse of Theorem 5 is true only for a special type of region. To explain this, we
ﬁrst need the concept of a simple curve, which is a curve that doesn’t intersect itself any-
where between its endpoints. [See Figure 6; 
for a simple closed curve, but
when

In Theorem 4 we needed an open connected region. For the next theorem we need a
stronger condition. A simply-connected region in the plane is a connected region

7 that, intuitively speaking, a simply-connected region contains no hole and can’t consist
of two separate pieces.
In terms of simply-connected regions we can now state a partial converse to Theorem 5
that gives a convenient method for verifying that a vector ﬁeld on 
is conservative. The
proof will be sketched in the next section as a consequence of Green’s Theorem.
THEOREM Let

region . Suppose that

Also, the domain of 
is the entire plane

the (potential) function 
such that

how to ﬁnd . We use “partial integration” as in the following example.

SOLUTION
(a) From Example 3 we know that

with

Integrating (7) with respect to , we obtain
Notice that the constant of integration is a constant with respect to , that is, a function
of , which we have called 
. Next we differentiate both sides of (9) with respect to :
Comparing (8) and (10), we see that
Integrating with respect to , we have

value of the constant 
will do, so let’s choose

This method is much shorter than the straightforward method for evaluating line inte-
grals that we learned in Section 16.2.

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

that moves an object
along a path 
given by 
, 
, where 
is the initial point and 
is the terminal point of 
. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion (see Sec-
tion 13.4), the force 
at a point on 
is related to the acceleration 
by the
equation
So the work done by the force on the object is
(Theorem 13.2.3, Formula 4)
(Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)
Therefore
where 
is the velocity.
The quantity 
, that is, half the mass times the square of the speed, is called the
kinetic energy of the object. Therefore we can rewrite Equation 15 as

energy at the endpoints of .
Now let’s further assume that 
is a conservative force ﬁeld; that is, we can write
. In physics, the potential energy of an object at the point

. Then by Theorem 2 we have
Comparing this equation with Equation 16, we see that
which says that if an object moves from one point 
to another point 
under the inﬂuence
of a conservative force ﬁeld, then the sum of its potential energy and its kinetic energy
remains constant. This is called the Law of Conservation of Energy and it is the reason
the vector ﬁeld is called conservative.

CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS

GREEN’S THEOREM
Green’s Theorem gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed
curve 
and a double integral over the plane region 
bounded by . (See Figure 1. We
assume that 
consists of all points inside 
as well as all points on .) In stating Green’s
Theorem we use the convention that the positive orientation of a simple closed curve 
refers to a single counterclockwise traversal of . Thus if 
is given by the vector func-
tion 
, 
, then the region 
is always on the left as the point 
traverses .
(See Figure 2.)
GREEN’S THEOREM Let 
be a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple
closed curve in the plane and let 
be the region bounded by . If 
and 
have
continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains , then
The notation
gC
is sometimes used to indicate that the line integral is calculated using the positive orienta-
tion of the closed curve . Another notation for the positively oriented boundary curve of
is 
, so the equation in Green’s Theorem can be written as
Green’s Theorem should be regarded as the counterpart of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus for double integrals. Compare Equation 1 with the statement of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, in the following equation:
In both cases there is an integral involving derivatives (
, 
, and 
) on the left
side of the equation. And in both cases the right side involves the values of the original
functions ( , , and ) only on the boundary of the domain. (In the one-dimensional case,
the domain is an interval 
whose boundary consists of just two points, and .)

Green’s Theorem is not easy to prove in general, but we can give a proof for the special
case where the region is both of type I and of type II (see Section 15.3). Let’s call such
regions simple regions.
PROOF OF GREEN’S THEOREM FOR THE CASE IN WHICH
IS A SIMPLE REGION Notice that Green’s
Theorem will be proved if we can show that
and
We prove Equation 2 by expressing 
as a type I region:
where 
and 
are continuous functions. This enables us to compute the double integral
on the right side of Equation 2 as follows:
where the last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Now we compute the left side of Equation 2 by breaking up 
as the union of the
four curves 
, 
, 
, and 
shown in Figure 3. On 
we take as the parameter and
write the parametric equations as 
, 
, 
. Thus
Observe that 
goes from right to left but 
goes from left to right, so we can write
the parametric equations of 
as 
, 
, 
. Therefore
On

CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS
N Green’s Theorem is named after the 
self-taught English scientist George Green
(1793–1841). He worked full-time in his father’s
bakery from the age of nine and taught himself
mathematics from library books. In 1828 he 
published privately An Essay on the Application
of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of
Electricity and Magnetism, but only 100 copies
were printed and most of those went to his
friends. This pamphlet contained a theorem 
that is equivalent to what we know as Green’s
Theorem, but it didn’t become widely known 
at that time. Finally, at age 40, Green entered 
Cambridge University as an undergraduate 
but died four years after graduation. In 1846 
William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) located a copy 
of Green’s essay, realized its signiﬁcance, and
had it reprinted. Green was the ﬁrst person to 
try to formulate a mathematical theory of elec-
tricity and magnetism. His work was the basis
for the subsequent electromagnetic theories of
Thomson, Stokes, Rayleigh, and Maxwell.

Comparing this expression with the one in Equation 4, we see that
Equation 3 can be proved in much the same way by expressing 
as a type II region (see
Exercise 28). Then, by adding Equations 2 and 3, we obtain Green’s Theorem.

EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate

line segments from 
to

to

to

SOLUTION Although the given line integral could be evaluated as usual by the methods of
Section 16.2, that would involve setting up three separate integrals along the three sides
of the triangle, so let’s use Green’s Theorem instead. Notice that the region 
enclosed
by 
is simple and 
has positive orientation (see Figure 4). If we let

EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate

SOLUTION The region 
bounded by 
is the disk 
, so let’s change to polar
coordinates after applying Green’s Theorem:
M
In Examples 1 and 2 we found that the double integral was easier to evaluate than the
line integral. (Try setting up the line integral in Example 2 and you’ll soon be convinced!)
But sometimes it’s easier to evaluate the line integral, and Green’s Theorem is used in the
reverse direction. For instance, if it is known that 
on the curve ,
then Green’s Theorem gives
no matter what values 
and 
assume in the region .
Another application of the reverse direction of Green’s Theorem is in computing areas.
Since the area of

There are several possibilities:
Then Green’s Theorem gives the following formulas for the area of 
:
EXAMPLE 3 Find the area enclosed by the ellipse
.
SOLUTION The ellipse has parametric equations 
and 
, where
. Using the third formula in Equation 5, we have
M
Although we have proved Green’s Theorem only for the case where 
is simple, we can
now extend it to the case where 
is a ﬁnite union of simple regions. For example, if 
is
the region shown in Figure 5, then we can write 
, where 
and 
are both
simple. The boundary of 
is 
and the boundary of 
is 
so, apply-
ing Green’s Theorem to 
and 
separately, we get
If we add these two equations, the line integrals along 
and 
cancel, so we get
which is Green’s Theorem for 
, since its boundary is 
.
The same sort of argument allows us to establish Green’s Theorem for any ﬁnite union
of nonoverlapping simple regions (see Figure 6).
EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate 
, where 
is the boundary of the semiannular
region 
in the upper half-plane between the circles 
and

is not simple, the -axis divides it into two simple
regions (see Figure 7). In polar coordinates we can write

Therefore Green’s Theorem gives
M
Green’s Theorem can be extended to apply to regions with holes, that is, regions that
are not simply-connected. Observe that the boundary 
of the region 
in Figure 8 con-
sists of two simple closed curves 
and 
. We assume that these boundary curves are 
oriented so that the region 
is always on the left as the curve 
is traversed. Thus the 
positive direction is counterclockwise for the outer curve 
but clockwise for the inner
curve 
. If we divide 
into two regions 
and 
by means of the lines shown in 
Figure 9 and then apply Green’s Theorem to each of 
and 
we get
Since the line integrals along the common boundary lines are in opposite directions, they
cancel and we get
which is Green’s Theorem for the region .
EXAMPLE 5 If 
, show that 
for every
positively oriented simple closed path that encloses the origin.
SOLUTION Since 
is an arbitrary closed path that encloses the origin, it’s difﬁcult to 
compute the given integral directly. So let’s consider a counterclockwise-oriented circle 
with center the origin and radius , where is chosen to be small enough that 
lies
inside . (See Figure 10.) Let 
be the region bounded by 
and 
. Then its positively
oriented boundary is 
and so the general version of Green’s Theorem gives

We end this section by using Green’s Theorem to discuss a result that was stated in the

SKETCH OF PROOF OF THEOREM 16.3.6
We’re assuming that 
is a vector ﬁeld on
an open simply-connected region , that 
and 
have continuous ﬁrst-order partial
derivatives, and that
If 
is any simple closed path in 
and 
is the region that 
encloses, then Green’s
Theorem gives
A curve that is not simple crosses itself at one or more points and can be broken up into
a number of simple curves. We have shown that the line integrals of 
around these 
simple curves are all 0 and, adding these integrals, we see that 
for any
closed curve . Therefore 
is independent of path in 
by Theorem 16.3.3. It
follows that 
is a conservative vector ﬁeld.

CURL AND DIVERGENCE
In this section we deﬁne two operations that can be performed on vector ﬁelds and that
play a basic role in the applications of vector calculus to ﬂuid ﬂow and electricity and mag-
netism. Each operation resembles differentiation, but one produces a vector ﬁeld whereas
the other produces a scalar ﬁeld.

CURL

is a vector ﬁeld on 
and the partial derivatives of , , and 
all exist, then the curl of 
is the vector ﬁeld on 
deﬁned by
As an aid to our memory, let’s rewrite Equation 1 using operator notation. We introduce
the vector differential operator 
(“del”) as
It has meaning when it operates on a scalar function to produce the gradient of :
If we think of 
as a vector with components 
, 
, and 
, we can also consider
the formal cross product of 
with the vector ﬁeld 
as follows:
Thus the easiest way to remember Deﬁnition 1 is by means of the symbolic expression

CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS
N Most computer algebra systems have
commands that compute the curl and divergence
of vector ﬁelds. If you have access to a CAS, use
these commands to check the answers to the
examples and exercises in this section.

Recall that the gradient of a function 
of three variables is a vector ﬁeld on 
and so
we can compute its curl. The following theorem says that the curl of a gradient vector ﬁeld
is .
THEOREM If 
is a function of three variables that has continuous second-
order partial derivatives, then
PROOF
We have
by Clairaut’s Theorem.
M
Since a conservative vector ﬁeld is one for which 
, Theorem 3 can be rephrased
as follows:
If 
is conservative, then 
.
This gives us a way of verifying that a vector ﬁeld is not conservative.
EXAMPLE 2 Show that the vector ﬁeld 
is not 
conservative.
SOLUTION In Example 1 we showed that
This shows that 
and so, by Theorem 3, 
is not conservative.
M
The converse of Theorem 3 is not true in general, but the following theorem says the
converse is true if 
is deﬁned everywhere. (More generally it is true if the domain is 
simply-connected, that is, “has no hole.”) Theorem 4 is the three-dimensional version of
Theorem 16.3.6. Its proof requires Stokes’ Theorem and is sketched at the end of 
Section 16.8.
THEOREM If 
is a vector ﬁeld deﬁned on all of 
whose component func-
tions have continuous partial derivatives and 
, then 
is a conservative
vector ﬁeld.

(a) We compute the curl of :

Theorem 4.

Integrating (5) with respect to , we obtain
Differentiating (8) with respect to , we get 
, so comparison
with (6) gives

and
Then (7) gives 
. Therefore
M
The reason for the name curl is that the curl vector is associated with rotations. One
connection is explained in Exercise 37. Another occurs when 
represents the velocity
ﬁeld in ﬂuid ﬂow (see Example 3 in Section 16.1). Particles near (x, y, ) in the ﬂuid tend
to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of 
and the length of this
curl vector is a measure of how quickly the particles move around the axis (see Figure 1).
If 
at a point , then the ﬂuid is free from rotations at 
and 
is called irro-
tational at . In other words, there is no whirlpool or eddy at P. If 
, then a 
tiny paddle wheel moves with the ﬂuid but doesn’t rotate about its axis. If 
, the
paddle wheel rotates about its axis. We give a more detailed explanation in Section 16.8 as
a consequence of Stokes’ Theorem.

the divergence of

SOLUTION By the deﬁnition of divergence (Equation 9 or 10) we have
M
If

. As such, we can 
compute its divergence. The next theorem shows that the result is 0.
THEOREM If

Using the deﬁnitions of divergence and curl, we have
because the terms cancel in pairs by Clairaut’s Theorem.

M
Again, the reason for the name divergence can be understood in the context of ﬂuid
ﬂow. If 
is the velocity of a ﬂuid (or gas), then 
represents the net rate
of change (with respect to time) of the mass of ﬂuid (or gas) ﬂowing from the point 
per unit volume. In other words, 
measures the tendency of the ﬂuid to diverge
from the point 
. If 
, then 
is said to be incompressible.
Another differential operator occurs when we compute the divergence of a gradient vec-
tor ﬁeld 
. If 
is a function of three variables, we have
and this expression occurs so often that we abbreviate it as 
. The operator
is called the Laplace operator because of its relation to Laplace’s equation
We can also apply the Laplace operator 
to a vector ﬁeld
in terms of its components:
VECTOR FORMS OF GREEN’S THEOREM
The curl and divergence operators allow us to rewrite Green’s Theorem in versions that
will be useful in our later work. We suppose that the plane region , its boundary curve 
, and the functions 
and 
satisfy the hypotheses of Green’s Theorem. Then we con-
sider the vector ﬁeld 
. Its line integral is
and, regarding 
as a vector ﬁeld on 
with third component , we have

CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS
PARAMETRIC SURFACES AND THEIR AREAS
So far we have considered special types of surfaces: cylinders, quadric surfaces, graphs of
functions of two variables, and level surfaces of functions of three variables. Here we use
vector functions to describe more general surfaces, called parametric surfaces, and com-
pute their areas. Then we take the general surface area formula and see how it applies to
special surfaces.
PARAMETRIC SURFACES
In much the same way that we describe a space curve by a vector function 
of a single
parameter , we can describe a surface by a vector function 
of two parameters and
. We suppose that
is a vector-valued function deﬁned on a region 
in the 
-plane. So x, y, and , the com-
ponent functions of r, are functions of the two variables u and with domain D. The set
of all points 
in 
such that
and 
varies throughout , is called a parametric surface
and Equations 2 are called
parametric equations of . Each choice of u and 
gives a point on S; by making all 
choices, we get all of S. In other words, the surface 
is traced out by the tip of the posi-
tion vector 
as 
moves throughout the region . (See Figure 1.)
EXAMPLE 1 Identify and sketch the surface with vector equation
SOLUTION The parametric equations for this surface are
So for any point 
on the surface, we have
This means that vertical cross-sections parallel to the 
-plane (that is, with y constant)
are all circles with radius 2. Since 
and no restriction is placed on , the surface is a
circular cylinder with radius 2 whose axis is the y-axis. (See Figure 2.)

In Example 1 we placed no restrictions on the parameters 
and and so we obtained
the entire cylinder. If, for instance, we restrict u and by writing the parameter domain as
then
and we get the quarter-cylinder with length 3 illustrated in
Figure 3.
If a parametric surface S is given by a vector function 
, then there are two useful
families of curves that lie on S, one family with u constant and the other with constant.
These families correspond to vertical and horizontal lines in the 
-plane. If we keep 
constant by putting 
becomes a vector function of the single parame-
ter and deﬁnes a curve 
lying on . (See Figure 4.)
Similarly, if we keep constant by putting 
given by 
that lies on . We call these curves grid curves. (In Example 1, for instance, the grid 
curves obtained by letting u be constant are horizontal lines whereas the grid curves with
constant are circles.) In fact, when a computer graphs a parametric surface, it usually
depicts the surface by plotting these grid curves, as we see in the following example.
EXAMPLE 2 Use a computer algebra system to graph the surface
Which grid curves have u constant? Which have constant?
SOLUTION We graph the portion of the surface with parameter domain 
in Figure 5. It has the appearance of a spiral tube. To identify the grid
curves, we write the corresponding parametric equations:
If is constant, then 
and 
are constant, so the parametric equations resemble
those of the helix in Example 4 in Section 13.1. So the grid curves with constant are
the spiral curves in Figure 5. We deduce that the grid curves with u constant must be the
curves that look like circles in the ﬁgure. Further evidence for this assertion is that if u
is kept constant, 
, then the equation 
shows that the -values vary
from 
to 
.
M
In Examples 1 and 2 we were given a vector equation and asked to graph the corre-
sponding parametric surface. In the following examples, however, we are given the more
challenging problem of ﬁnding a vector function to represent a given surface. In the rest of
this chapter we will often need to do exactly that.

EXAMPLE 3 Find a vector function that represents the plane that passes through the

and that contains two nonparallel vectors a and b.

distance in the direction of and another distance in the direction of . So there are
scalars u and such that A

EXAMPLE 4 Find a parametric representation of the sphere
SOLUTION The sphere has a simple representation 
in spherical coordinates, so let’s
choose the angles

in spherical coordinates as the parameters (see Section 15.8).
Then, putting 
in the equations for conversion from spherical to rectangular coordi-
nates (Equations 15.8.1), we obtain
as the parametric equations of the sphere. The corresponding vector equation is
We have 
and 
, so the parameter domain is the rectangle
. The grid curves with 
constant are the circles of constant lati-
tude (including the equator). The grid curves with
constant are the meridians (semi-
circles), which connect the north and south poles.

In general, a surface given as the graph of a function of

tion of the form 
, can always be regarded as a parametric surface by taking 
and as parameters and writing the parametric equations as
Parametric representations (also called parametrizations) of surfaces are not unique. The
next example shows two ways to parametrize a cone.
EXAMPLE 7 Find a parametric representation for the surface 
, that is, the
top half of the cone 
.
SOLUTION 1 One possible representation is obtained by choosing x and y as parameters:
So the vector equation is
SOLUTION 2 Another representation results from choosing as parameters the polar coor-
dinates r and . A point 
on the cone satisﬁes

TANGENT PLANES
We now ﬁnd the tangent plane to a parametric surface traced out by a vector function
at a point 
with position vector 
. If we keep 
constant by putting

becomes a vector function of the single parameter 
and deﬁnes a grid curve 
lying on . (See Figure 11.) The tangent vector to 
at 
is obtained by taking the partial
derivative of with respect to :
Similarly, if we keep

If 
is not , then the surface is called smooth (it has no “corners”). For a smooth
surface, the tangent plane is the plane that contains the tangent vectors 
and
, and the
vector 
is a normal vector to the tangent plane.
EXAMPLE 9 Find the tangent plane to the surface with parametric equations 
,
, 
at the point 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst compute the tangent vectors:
Thus a normal vector to the tangent plane is
Notice that the point 
corresponds to the parameter values 
and 
, so
the normal vector there is
Therefore an equation of the tangent plane at 
is

SURFACE AREA
Now we deﬁne the surface area of a general parametric surface given by Equation 1. For
simplicity we start by considering a surface whose parameter domain 
is a rectangle, and
we divide it into subrectangles 
. Let’s choose 
to be the lower left corner of 
.
(See Figure 13.) The part 
of the surface 
that corresponds to 
is called a patch and 
has the point 
with position vector 
as one of its corners. Let
be the tangent vectors at 
as given by Equations 5 and 4.

Figure 14(a) shows how the two edges of the patch that meet at 
can be approximated
by vectors. These vectors, in turn, can be approximated by the vectors 
and 
because partial derivatives can be approximated by difference quotients. So we approxi-
mate 
by the parallelogram determined by the vectors 
and 
. This parallelo-
gram is shown in Figure 14(b) and lies in the tangent plane to 
at 
The area of this 
parallelogram is
and so an approximation to the area of 
is
Our intuition tells us that this approximation gets better as we increase the number of sub-
rectangles, and we recognize the double sum as a Riemann sum for the double integral
. This motivates the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION

is given by the equation

is covered just once as 
ranges throughout the parameter domain ,

is continuous. From Equations 3 we know that para-
metric equations of

To compute the surface area of

SURFACE INTEGRALS
The relationship between surface integrals and surface area is much the same as the rela-
tionship between line integrals and arc length. Suppose is a function of three variables
whose domain includes a surface . We will deﬁne the surface integral of over 
in such
a way that, in the case where 
, the value of the surface integral is equal to the
surface area of . We start with parametric surfaces and then deal with the special case
where 
is the graph of a function of two variables.
PARAMETRIC SURFACES
Suppose that a surface 
has a vector equation
We ﬁrst assume that the parameter domain 
is a rectangle and we divide it into subrect-
angles 
with dimensions 
and 
. Then the surface 
is divided into corresponding
patches 
as in Figure 1. We evaluate 
at a point 
in each patch, multiply by the area
of the patch, and form the Riemann sum
Then we take the limit as the number of patches increases and deﬁne the surface integral
of f over the surface S as
Notice the analogy with the deﬁnition of a line integral (16.2.2) and also the analogy with
the deﬁnition of a double integral (15.1.5).
To evaluate the surface integral in Equation 1 we approximate the patch area 
by the
area of an approximating parallelogram in the tangent plane. In our discussion of surface
area in Section 16.6 we made the approximation

ORIENTED SURFACES
To deﬁne surface integrals of vector ﬁelds, we need to rule out nonorientable surfaces such
as the Möbius strip shown in Figure 4. [It is named after the German geometer August
Möbius (1790–1868).] You can construct one for yourself by taking a long rectangular
strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and taping the short edges together as in Figure 5. 
If an ant were to crawl along the Möbius strip starting at a point , it would end up on 
the “other side” of the strip (that is, with its upper side pointing in the opposite direction).
Then, if the ant continued to crawl in the same direction, it would end up back at the 
same point without ever having crossed an edge. (If you have constructed a Möbius strip,
try drawing a pencil line down the middle.) Therefore a Möbius strip really has only 
one side. You can graph the Möbius strip using the parametric equations in Exercise 32 in 
Section 16.6.

TEC

From now on we consider only orientable (two-sided) surfaces. We start with a surface
that has a tangent plane at every point 
on (except at any boundary point). There
are two unit normal vectors 
and 
at 
. (See Figure 6.) 
If it is possible to choose a unit normal vector 
at every such point 
so that 
varies continuously over , then is called an oriented surface and the given choice of 
provides with an orientation. There are two possible orientations for any orientable sur-
face (see Figure 7).
For a surface 
given as the graph of , we use Equation 3 to associate with
the surface a natural orientation given by the unit normal vector
Since the -component is positive, this gives the upward orientation of the surface.
If 
is a smooth orientable surface given in parametric form by a vector function 
, then it is automatically supplied with the orientation of the unit normal vector
and the opposite orientation is given by 
. For instance, in Example 4 in Section 16.6 we
found the parametric representation
for the sphere 
. Then in Example 10 in Section 16.6 we found that
and
So the orientation induced by 
is deﬁned by the unit normal vector
Observe that points in the same direction as the position vector, that is, outward from the
sphere (see Figure 8). The opposite (inward) orientation would have been obtained (see
Figure 9) if we had reversed the order of the parameters because 
.
For a closed surface, that is, a surface that is the boundary of a solid region , the 
convention is that the positive orientation is the one for which the normal vectors point
outward from , and inward-pointing normals give the negative orientation (see Figures 8
and 9).

SURFACE INTEGRALS OF VECTOR FIELDS
Suppose that 
is an oriented surface with unit normal vector , and imagine a ﬂuid with
density 
and velocity ﬁeld 
ﬂowing through . (Think of 
as an imagi-
nary surface that doesn’t impede the ﬂuid ﬂow, like a ﬁshing net across a stream.) Then the
rate of ﬂow (mass per unit time) per unit area is 
. If we divide 
into small patches 
,
as in Figure 10 (compare with Figure 1), then 
is nearly planar and so we can approxi-
mate the mass of ﬂuid crossing 
in the direction of the normal 
per unit time by the
quantity
where , , and are evaluated at some point on 
. (Recall that the component of the vec-
tor 
in the direction of the unit vector is 
.) By summing these quantities and tak-
ing the limit we get, according to Deﬁnition 1, the surface integral of the function 
over :
and this is interpreted physically as the rate of ﬂow through .
If we write 
, then 
is also a vector ﬁeld on 
and the integral in Equation 7
becomes
A surface integral of this form occurs frequently in physics, even when 
is not 
, and is
called the surface integral (or ﬂux integral) of 
over .
DEFINITION If 
is a continuous vector ﬁeld deﬁned on an oriented surface 
with unit normal vector , then the surface integral of 
over S is
This integral is also called the ﬂux of 
across .
In words, Deﬁnition 8 says that the surface integral of a vector ﬁeld over 
is equal to
the surface integral of its normal component over 
(as previously deﬁned).
If 
is given by a vector function 
, then 
is given by Equation 6, and from Def-
inition 8 and Equation 2 we have
where 
is the parameter domain. Thus we have

EXAMPLE 4 Find the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld

SOLUTION Using the parametric representation
we have
and, from Example 10 in Section 16.6,
Therefore
and, by Formula 9, the ﬂux is
by the same calculation as in Example 1.
M
If, for instance, the vector ﬁeld in Example 4 is a velocity ﬁeld describing the ﬂow of a
ﬂuid with density 1, then the answer, 
, represents the rate of ﬂow through the unit
sphere in units of mass per unit time.
In the case of a surface given by a graph 
, we can think of and as param-
eters and use Equation 3 to write
Thus Formula 9 becomes

ply by

consists of a parabolic top surface 
and a circular bottom surface 
. (See
Figure 12.) Since 
is a closed surface, we use the convention of positive (outward) 
orientation. This means that 
is oriented upward and we can use Equation 10 with

on the

. Since

The disk 
is oriented downward, so its unit normal vector is 
and we have

Although we motivated the surface integral of a vector ﬁeld using the example of ﬂuid
ﬂow, this concept also arises in other physical situations. For instance, if 
is an electric
ﬁeld (see Example 5 in Section 16.1), then the surface integral
is called the electric ﬂux of 
through the surface . One of the important laws of electro-

statics is Gauss’s Law, which says that the net charge enclosed by a closed surface 
is
where 
is a constant (called the permittivity of free space) that depends on the units used.
(In the SI system, 
.) Therefore, if the vector ﬁeld 
in
Example 4 represents an electric ﬁeld, we can conclude that the charge enclosed by 
is
.
Another application of surface integrals occurs in the study of heat ﬂow. Suppose the
temperature at a point 
in a body is 
. Then the heat ﬂow is deﬁned as the
vector ﬁeld
where 
is an experimentally determined constant called the conductivity of the sub-
stance. The rate of heat ﬂow across the surface 
in the body is then given by the surface
integral
EXAMPLE 6 The temperature in a metal ball is proportional to the square of the
distance from the center of the ball. Find the rate of heat ﬂow across a sphere 
of 
radius with center at the center of the ball.
SOLUTION Taking the center of the ball to be at the origin, we have
where 
is the proportionality constant. Then the heat ﬂow is
where 
is the conductivity of the metal. Instead of using the usual parametrization of
the sphere as in Example 4, we observe that the outward unit normal to the sphere
at the point 
is
and so
But on 
we have 
, so

ﬂow across

CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS
STOKES’ THEOREM
Stokes’ Theorem can be regarded as a higher-dimensional version of Green’s Theorem.
Whereas Green’s Theorem relates a double integral over a plane region 
to a line integral
around its plane boundary curve, Stokes’ Theorem relates a surface integral over a surface
to a line integral around the boundary curve of (which is a space curve). Figure 1 shows 
S
S

an oriented surface with unit normal vector . The orientation of 
induces the positive
orientation of the boundary curve C shown in the ﬁgure. This means that if you walk in
the positive direction around 
with your head pointing in the direction of , then the sur-
face will always be on your left.
STOKES’ THEOREM Let 
be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded
by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve 
with positive orientation.
Let 
be a vector ﬁeld whose components have continuous partial derivatives on 
an open region in 
that contains . Then
Since
Stokes’ Theorem says that the line integral around the boundary curve of 
of the tangen-
tial component of 
is equal to the surface integral of the normal component of the curl 
of .
The positively oriented boundary curve of the oriented surface 
is often written as 
, so Stokes’ Theorem can be expressed as
There is an analogy among Stokes’ Theorem, Green’s Theorem, and the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus. As before, there is an integral involving derivatives on the left side
of Equation 1 (recall that 
is a sort of derivative of ) and the right side involves the
values of 
only on the boundary of .
In fact, in the special case where the surface 
is ﬂat and lies in the 
-plane with
upward orientation, the unit normal is , the surface integral becomes a double integral,
and Stokes’ Theorem becomes
This is precisely the vector form of Green’s Theorem given in Equation 16.5.12. Thus we
see that Green’s Theorem is really a special case of Stokes’ Theorem.
Although Stokes’ Theorem is too difﬁcult for us to prove in its full generality, we can
give a proof when 
is a graph and , , and 
are well behaved.
PROOF OF A SPECIAL CASE OF STOKES’ THEOREM
We assume that the equation of 
is 
, where has continuous second-order partial derivatives and 
is a simple
plane region whose boundary curve 
corresponds to . If the orientation of 
is
upward, then the positive orientation of 
corresponds to the positive orientation of 
.
(See Figure 2.) We are also given that 
, where the partial deriva-
tives of , , and 
are continuous.

N Stokes’ Theorem is named after the Irish
mathematical physicist Sir George Stokes
(1819–1903). Stokes was a professor at Cam-
bridge University (in fact he held the same 
position as Newton, Lucasian Professor of 
Mathematics) and was especially noted for his
studies of ﬂuid ﬂow and light. What we call
Stokes’ Theorem was actually discovered by 
the Scottish physicist Sir William Thomson
(1824–1907, known as Lord Kelvin). Stokes
learned of this theorem in a letter from Thomson
in 1850 and asked students to prove it on an
examination at Cambridge University in 1854.
We don’t know if any of those students was 
able to do so.

This allows us, with the aid of the Chain Rule, to evaluate the line integral as follows:
where we have used Green’s Theorem in the last step. Then, using the Chain Rule again
and remembering that , , and 
are functions of , , and and that is itself a func-
tion of and , we get
Four of the terms in this double integral cancel and the remaining six terms can be
arranged to coincide with the right side of Equation 2. Therefore

Note that in Example 2 we computed a surface integral simply by knowing the values
of 
on the boundary curve . This means that if we have another oriented surface with the
same boundary curve , then we get exactly the same value for the surface integral!
In general, if 
and 
are oriented surfaces with the same oriented boundary curve 
and both satisfy the hypotheses of Stokes’ Theorem, then
This fact is useful when it is difﬁcult to integrate over one surface but easy to integrate over
the other.
We now use Stokes’ Theorem to throw some light on the meaning of the curl vector.
Suppose that 
is an oriented closed curve and represents the velocity ﬁeld in ﬂuid ﬂow.
Consider the line integral
and recall that 
is the component of 
in the direction of the unit tangent vector .
This means that the closer the direction of is to the direction of , the larger the value of
. Thus 
is a measure of the tendency of the ﬂuid to move around 
and is
called the circulation of around . (See Figure 5.)
Now let 
be a point in the ﬂuid and let 
be a small disk with radius and
center 
Then (
for all points 
on 
because 
is con-
tinuous. Thus, by Stokes’ Theorem, we get the following approximation to the circulation
around the boundary circle 
:
This approximation becomes better as 
and we have
Equation 4 gives the relationship between the curl and the circulation. It shows that
is a measure of the rotating effect of the ﬂuid about the axis n. The curling effect
is greatest about the axis parallel to 
.
Finally, we mention that Stokes’ Theorem can be used to prove Theorem 16.5.4 (which
states that if 
on all of 
, then 
is conservative). From our previous work
(Theorems 16.3.3 and 16.3.4), we know that 
is conservative if 
for every
closed path . Given , suppose we can ﬁnd an orientable surface 
whose boundary is 
. (This can be done, but the proof requires advanced techniques.) Then Stokes’ Theorem
gives
A curve that is not simple can be broken into a number of simple curves, and the integrals
around these simple curves are all 0. Adding these integrals, we obtain 
for
any closed curve .

CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS
Although two of the most important theorems in vector calculus are named after George Green 
and George Stokes, a third man, William Thomson (also known as Lord Kelvin), played a large
role in the formulation, dissemination, and application of both of these results. All three men 
were interested in how the two theorems could help to explain and predict physical phenomena 
in electricity and magnetism and ﬂuid ﬂow. The basic facts of the story are given in the margin
notes on pages 1056 and 1093.
Write a report on the historical origins of Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem. Explain the
similarities and relationship between the theorems. Discuss the roles that Green, Thomson, and
Stokes played in discovering these theorems and making them widely known. Show how both
theorems arose from the investigation of electricity and magnetism and were later used to study a
variety of physical problems.
The dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is a good source for both biographical and scientiﬁc 
information. The book by Hutchinson [5] gives an account of Stokes’ life and the book by 
Thompson [8] is a biography of Lord Kelvin. The articles by Grattan-Guinness [3] and Gray [4]
and the book by Cannell [1] give background on the extraordinary life and works of Green. 
Additional historical and mathematical information is found in the books by Katz [6] and 
Kline [7].

THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
In Section 16.5 we rewrote Green’s Theorem in a vector version as
where 
is the positively oriented boundary curve of the plane region . If we were seek-
ing to extend this theorem to vector ﬁelds on 
, we might make the guess that
where 
is the boundary surface of the solid region . It turns out that Equation 1 is true,
under appropriate hypotheses, and is called the Divergence Theorem. Notice its similarity
to Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem in that it relates the integral of a derivative of a
function (
in this case) over a region to the integral of the original function 
over the
boundary of the region.
At this stage you may wish to review the various types of regions over which we were
able to evaluate triple integrals in Section 15.6. We state and prove the Divergence Theo-
rem for regions 
that are simultaneously of types 1, 2, and 3 and we call such regions 
simple solid regions. (For instance, regions bounded by ellipsoids or rectangular boxes are
simple solid regions.) The boundary of 
is a closed surface, and we use the convention,
introduced in Section 16.7, that the positive orientation is outward; that is, the unit normal
vector 
is directed outward from .
THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM Let 
be a simple solid region and let S be the bound-
ary surface of E, given with positive (outward) orientation. Let 
be a vector ﬁeld
whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives on an open region
that contains . Then
Thus the Divergence Theorem states that, under the given conditions, the ﬂux of 
across the boundary surface of 
is equal to the triple integral of the divergence of 
over .

SECTION 16.9 THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
||||
1099
N The Divergence Theorem is sometimes called
Gauss’s Theorem after the great German mathe-
matician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), who
discovered this theorem during his investigation
of electrostatics. In Eastern Europe the Diver-
gence Theorem is known as Ostrogradsky’s 
Theorem after the Russian mathematician
Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1801–1862), who pub-
lished this result in 1826.

Divergence Theorem is
Therefore, to prove the Divergence Theorem, it sufﬁces to prove the following three
equations:
To prove Equation 4 we use the fact that 
is a type 1 region:
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane. By Equation 15.6.6, we have
and therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
The boundary surface 
consists of three pieces: the bottom surface 
, the top surface
, and possibly a vertical surface 
, which lies above the boundary curve of D. (See
Figure 1. It might happen that 
doesn’t appear, as in the case of a sphere.) Notice that
on 
we have 
, because k is vertical and n is horizontal, and so
Thus, regardless of whether there is a vertical surface, we can write
The equation of

is much less complicated than 
itself:
Therefore we use the Divergence Theorem to transform the given surface integral into a
triple integral. The easiest way to evaluate the triple integral is to express 
as a type 3

Although we have proved the Divergence Theorem only for simple solid regions, it can be
proved for regions that are ﬁnite unions of simple solid regions. (The procedure is similar
to the one we used in Section 16.4 to extend Green’s Theorem.)
For example, let’s consider the region
that lies between the closed surfaces
and
,
where 
lies inside 
. Let 
and 
be outward normals of 
and 
. Then the boundary
surface of

and its normal 
is given by 
on 
and 
on 
(See Figure 3.) Applying the Divergence Theorem to , we get
Let’s apply this to the electric ﬁeld (see Example 5 in Section 16.1):
where 
is a small sphere with radius 
and center the origin. You can verify that
. (See Exercise 23.) Therefore Equation 7 gives
The point of this calculation is that we can compute the surface integral over 
because 
is a sphere. The normal vector at 
is 
. Therefore
since the equation of 
is 
. Thus we have
This shows that the electric ﬂux of

Another application of the Divergence Theorem occurs in ﬂuid ﬂow. Let 
be
the velocity ﬁeld of a ﬂuid with constant density . Then 
is the rate of ﬂow per
unit area. If 
is a point in the ﬂuid and 
is a ball with center 
and very small
radius , then 
for all points in 
since 
is continuous. We
approximate the ﬂux over the boundary sphere 
as follows:
This approximation becomes better as 
and suggests that
Equation 8 says that 
is the net rate of outward ﬂux per unit volume at 
. (This
is the reason for the name divergence.) If 
, the net ﬂow is outward near 
and
is called a source. If 
, the net ﬂow is inward near 
and 
is called a sink.
For the vector ﬁeld in Figure 4, it appears that the vectors that end near 
are shorter
than the vectors that start near 
Thus the net ﬂow is outward near 
so 
and 
is a source. Near 
on the other hand, the incoming arrows are longer than the 
outgoing arrows. Here the net ﬂow is inward, so 
and 
is a sink. We 
can use the formula for F to conﬁrm this impression. Since 
, we have
, which is positive when 
. So the points above the line 
are sources and those below are sinks.

SUMMARY
The main results of this chapter are all higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus. To help you remember them, we collect them together here (with-
out hypotheses) so that you can see more easily their essential similarity. Notice that in
each case we have an integral of a “derivative” over a region on the left side, and the right
side involves the values of the original function only on the boundary of the region.

1. Let 
be a smooth parametric surface and let 
be a point such that each line that starts 
at 
intersects 
at most once. The solid angle
subtended by 
at 
is the set of lines
starting at 
and passing through . Let 
be the intersection of 
with the surface of
the sphere with center 
and radius . Then the measure of the solid angle (in steradians) is
deﬁned to be
Apply the Divergence Theorem to the part of 
between 
and 
to show that
where is the radius vector from 
to any point on , 
, and the unit normal vector 
is
directed away from .
This shows that the deﬁnition of the measure of a solid angle is independent of the radius 
of the sphere. Thus the measure of the solid angle is equal to the area subtended on a unit
sphere. (Note the analogy with the deﬁnition of radian measure.) The total solid angle sub-
tended by a sphere at its center is thus 
steradians.
2. Find the positively oriented simple closed curve 
for which the value of the line integral
is a maximum.
3. Let 
be a simple closed piecewise-smooth space curve that lies in a plane with unit normal

. Start by graphing the surface from several points of view. Explain the 
appearance of the graphs by determining the traces in the horizontal planes 
, 
,
and 
.
5. Prove the following identity:
6. The ﬁgure depicts the sequence of events in each cylinder of a four-cylinder internal combus-
tion engine. Each piston moves up and down and is connected by a pivoted arm to a rotating
crankshaft. Let 
and 
be the pressure and volume within a cylinder at time , where
gives the time required for a complete cycle. The graph shows how 
and 
vary
through one cycle of a four-stroke engine. During the intake stroke (from ①to ②) a mixture
of air and gasoline at atmospheric pressure is drawn into a cylinder through the intake valve 
as the piston moves downward. Then the piston rapidly compresses the mix with the valves
closed in the compression stroke (from ②to ③) during which the pressure rises and the vol-
ume decreases. At ③the sparkplug ignites the fuel, raising the temperature and pressure at
almost constant volume to ④. Then, with valves closed, the rapid expansion forces the piston
downward during the power stroke (from ④to ⑤). The exhaust valve opens, temperature and
pressure drop, and mechanical energy stored in a rotating ﬂywheel pushes the piston upward,
forcing the waste products out of the exhaust valve in the exhaust stroke. The exhaust valve
closes and the intake valve opens. We’re now back at ①and the cycle starts again.
(a) Show that the work done on the piston during one cycle of a four-stroke engine is

the force on the piston is

is given by 
. An alternative approach is 
to work directly with Riemann sums.]

two loops of .

The basic ideas of differential equations were explained in Chapter 9; there we concen-
trated on ﬁrst-order equations. In this chapter we study second-order linear differential
equations and learn how they can be applied to solve problems concerning the vibrations
of springs and the analysis of electric circuits. We will also see how inﬁnite series can be
used to solve differential equations.
Most of the solutions of the differential equation 
resemble sine functions when is negative but they all look like 
exponential functions when is large.

SECOND-ORDER LINEAR EQUATIONS
A second-order linear differential equation has the form
where , , , and 
are continuous functions. We saw in Section 9.1 that equations of
this type arise in the study of the motion of a spring. In Section 17.3 we will further pur-
sue this application as well as the application to electric circuits.
In this section we study the case where 
, for all , in Equation 1. Such equa-
tions are called homogeneous linear equations. Thus the form of a second-order linear homo-
geneous differential equation is
If 
for some , Equation 1 is nonhomogeneous and is discussed in Section 17.2.
Two basic facts enable us to solve homogeneous linear equations. The ﬁrst of these says
that if we know two solutions 
and 
of such an equation, then the linear combination
is also a solution.
THEOREM If 
and 
are both solutions of the linear homogeneous
equation (2) and 
and 
are any constants, then the function
is also a solution of Equation 2.
PROOF
Since 
and 
are solutions of Equation 2, we have
and
Therefore, using the basic rules for differentiation, we have
Thus 
is a solution of Equation 2.

The other fact we need is given by the following theorem, which is proved in more
advanced courses. It says that the general solution is a linear combination of two linearly
independent solutions 
and 
This means that neither 
nor 
is a constant multiple
of the other. For instance, the functions 
and 
are linearly dependent,
but 
and 
are linearly independent.
THEOREM If 
and 
are linearly independent solutions of Equation 2, and
is never 0, then the general solution is given by
where 
and 
are arbitrary constants.
Theorem 4 is very useful because it says that if we know two particular linearly inde-
pendent solutions, then we know every solution.
In general, it is not easy to discover particular solutions to a second-order linear equa-
tion. But it is always possible to do so if the coefﬁcient functions , , and 
are constant
functions, that is, if the differential equation has the form
where , , and are constants and 
.
It’s not hard to think of some likely candidates for particular solutions of Equation 5 if
we state the equation verbally. We are looking for a function such that a constant times
its second derivative 
plus another constant times 
plus a third constant times is equal
to 0. We know that the exponential function 
(where is a constant) has the prop-
erty that its derivative is a constant multiple of itself: 
. Furthermore, 
.
If we substitute these expressions into Equation 5, we see that 
is a solution if
or
But 
is never 0. Thus 
is a solution of Equation 5 if is a root of the equation
Equation 6 is called the auxiliary equation (or characteristic equation) of the differen-
tial equation 
. Notice that it is an algebraic equation that is obtained
from the differential equation by replacing 
by 
, 
by , and by .
Sometimes the roots 
and 
of the auxiliary equation can be found by factoring. In
other cases they are found by using the quadratic formula:

In this case the roots

are real numbers. [In fact, 
, 
.] Then,
using Euler’s equation
from Appendix H, we write the solution of the differential equation as
where 
,

ferential equation. The solutions are real when the constants

INITIAL-VALUE AND BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEMS
An initial-value problem for the second-order Equation 1 or 2 consists of ﬁnding a solu-
tion of the differential equation that also satisﬁes initial conditions of the form
where 
and 
are given constants. If , , , and 
are continuous on an interval and
there, then a theorem found in more advanced books guarantees the existence
and uniqueness of a solution to this initial-value problem. Examples 5 and 6 illustrate the
technique for solving such a problem.
EXAMPLE 5 Solve the initial-value problem
SOLUTION From Example 1 we know that the general solution of the differential equa-
tion is
Differentiating this solution, we get
To satisfy the initial conditions we require that
From (13), we have 
and so (12) gives
Thus the required solution of the initial-value problem is

A boundary-value problem for Equation 1 or 2 consists of ﬁnding a solution of the
differential equation that also satisﬁes boundary conditions of the form
In contrast with the situation for initial-value problems, a boundary-value problem does
not always have a solution. The method is illustrated in Example 7.

NONHOMOGENEOUS LINEAR EQUATIONS
In this section we learn how to solve second-order nonhomogeneous linear differential equa-
tions with constant coefﬁcients, that is, equations of the form
where , , and are constants and 
is a continuous function. The related homogeneous
equation
is called the complementary equation and plays an important role in the solution of the
original nonhomogeneous equation (1).

THEOREM The general solution of the nonhomogeneous differential equation
(1) can be written as
where 
is a particular solution of Equation 1 and 
is the general solution of the
complementary Equation 2.
PROOF
All we have to do is verify that if is any solution of Equation 1, then 
is a
solution of the complementary Equation 2. Indeed
M
We know from Section 17.1 how to solve the complementary equation. (Recall that the
solution is 
, where 
and 
are linearly independent solutions of Equa-
tion 2.) Therefore Theorem 3 says that we know the general solution of the nonhomoge-
neous equation as soon as we know a particular solution 
. There are two methods for
ﬁnding a particular solution: The method of undetermined coefﬁcients is straightforward
but works only for a restricted class of functions . The method of variation of parameters
works for every function 
but is usually more difﬁcult to apply in practice.
THE METHOD OF UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS
We ﬁrst illustrate the method of undetermined coefﬁcients for the equation
where 
) is a polynomial. It is reasonable to guess that there is a particular solution 
that is a polynomial of the same degree as 
because if 
is a polynomial, then
is also a polynomial. We therefore substitute 
a polynomial (of the
same degree as ) into the differential equation and determine the coefﬁcients.
EXAMPLE 1 Solve the equation 
.
SOLUTION The auxiliary equation of 
is
with roots 
, 
. So the solution of the complementary equation is
Since 
is a polynomial of degree 2, we seek a particular solution of the form
Then 
and 
so, substituting into the given differential equation, we
have

Polynomials are equal when their coefﬁcients are equal. Thus
The solution of this system of equations is
A particular solution is therefore
and, by Theorem 3, the general solution is
M
If 
(the right side of Equation 1) is of the form 
, where

then we take as a trial solution a function of the same form, 
, because the

APPLICATIONS OF SECOND-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Second-order linear differential equations have a variety of applications in science and
engineering. In this section we explore two of them: the vibration of springs and electric
circuits.
VIBRATING SPRINGS
We consider the motion of an object with mass 
at the end of a spring that is either ver-
tical (as in Figure 1) or horizontal on a level surface (as in Figure 2).
In Section 6.4 we discussed Hooke’s Law, which says that if the spring is stretched (or
compressed) units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to :
where is a positive constant (called the spring constant). If we ignore any external resist-
ing forces (due to air resistance or friction) then, by Newton’s Second Law (force equals
mass times acceleration), we have
This is a second-order linear differential equation. Its auxiliary equation is 
with roots 
, where

EXAMPLE 1 A spring with a mass of 2 kg has natural length 
m. A force of 
N
is required to maintain it stretched to a length of 
m. If the spring is stretched to a
length of 
m and then released with initial velocity 0, ﬁnd the position of the mass at
any time .
SOLUTION From Hooke’s Law, the force required to stretch the spring is
so 
. Using this value of the spring constant , together with 
in Equation 1, we have
As in the earlier general discussion, the solution of this equation is

Therefore

Since the initial velocity is given as

and so the solution is
M
DAMPED VIBRATIONS
We next consider the motion of a spring that is subject to a frictional force (in the case of
the horizontal spring of Figure 2) or a damping force (in the case where a vertical spring
moves through a ﬂuid as in Figure 3). An example is the damping force supplied by a
shock absorber in a car or a bicycle.
We assume that the damping force is proportional to the velocity of the mass and acts
in the direction opposite to the motion. (This has been conﬁrmed, at least approximately,
by some physical experiments.) Thus
where is a positive constant, called the damping constant. Thus, in this case, Newton’s
Second Law gives

because 
means that there is a strong damping force (high-viscosity oil or grease)
compared with a weak spring or small mass.

This case corresponds to equal roots
and the solution is given by
It is similar to Case I, and typical graphs resemble those in Figure 4 (see Exercise 12), but
the damping is just sufﬁcient to suppress vibrations. Any decrease in the viscosity of the
ﬂuid leads to the vibrations of the following case.

Suppose that, in addition to the restoring force and the damping force, the motion of the
spring is affected by an external force

Thus, instead of the homogeneous equation (3), the motion of the spring is now governed
by the following nonhomogeneous differential equation:

A commonly occurring type of external force is a periodic force function
In this case, and in the absence of a damping force (
), you are asked in Exercise 9 to
use the method of undetermined coefﬁcients to show that
If 
, then the applied frequency reinforces the natural frequency and the result is
vibrations of large amplitude. This is the phenomenon of resonance (see Exercise 10).
ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
In Sections 9.3 and 9.5 we were able to use ﬁrst-order separable and linear equations to
analyze electric circuits that contain a resistor and inductor (see Figure 5 on page 582 or
Figure 4 on page 605) or a resistor and capacitor (see Exercise 29 on page 607). Now that
we know how to solve second-order linear equations, we are in a position to analyze the
circuit shown in Figure 7. It contains an electromotive force 
(supplied by a battery or
generator), a resistor , an inductor , and a capacitor , in series. If the charge on the
capacitor at time 
is 
, then the current is the rate of change of 
with respect 
to : 
. As in Section 9.5, it is known from physics that the voltage drops across
the resistor, inductor, and capacitor are
respectively. Kirchhoff’s voltage law says that the sum of these voltage drops is equal to
the supplied voltage:
Since 
, this equation becomes
which is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients. If the charge
and the current 
are known at time 0, then we have the initial conditions
and the initial-value problem can be solved by the methods of Section 17.2.

To impose the other initial condition, we ﬁrst differentiate to ﬁnd the current:

So, for large values of ,
and, for this reason, 
is called the steady state solution. Figure 8 shows how the graph
of the steady state solution compares with the graph of 
in this case.
Comparing Equations 5 and 7, we see that mathematically they are identical.
This suggests the analogies given in the following chart between physical situations that,
at ﬁrst glance, are very different.
We can also transfer other ideas from one situation to the other. For instance, the steady
state solution discussed in Note 1 makes sense in the spring system. And the phenomenon
of resonance in the spring system can be usefully carried over to electric circuits as elec-
trical resonance.

SERIES SOLUTIONS
Many differential equations can’t be solved explicitly in terms of ﬁnite combinations of
simple familiar functions. This is true even for a simple-looking equation like
But it is important to be able to solve equations such as Equation 1 because they arise from
physical problems and, in particular, in connection with the Schrödinger equation in quan-
tum mechanics. In such a case we use the method of power series; that is, we look for a
solution of the form
The method is to substitute this expression into the differential equation and determine the
values of the coefﬁcients 
This technique resembles the method of undeter-
mined coefﬁcients discussed in Section 17.2.
Before using power series to solve Equation 1, we illustrate the method on the simpler
equation 
in Example 1. It’s true that we already know how to solve this equa-
tion by the techniques of Section 17.1, but it’s easier to understand the power series
method when it is applied to this simpler equation.
EXAMPLE 1 Use power series to solve the equation 
.
SOLUTION We assume there is a solution of the form
We can differentiate power series term by term, so
In order to compare the expressions for and 
more easily, we rewrite 
as follows:
Substituting the expressions in Equations 2 and 4 into the differential equation, we
obtain

If two power series are equal, then the corresponding coefﬁcients must be equal. There-
fore the coefﬁcients of 
in Equation 5 must be 0:
Equation 6 is called a recursion relation. If 
and 
are known, this equation allows 
us to determine the remaining coefﬁcients recursively by putting 
in 
succession.
By now we see the pattern:
Putting these values back into Equation 2, we write the solution as

NUMBERS, INEQUALITIES, AND ABSOLUTE VALUES
Calculus is based on the real number system. We start with the integers:
Then we construct the rational numbers, which are ratios of integers. Thus any rational
number can be expressed as
Examples are
(Recall that division by 
is always ruled out, so expressions like and are undeﬁned.)
Some real numbers, such as 
, can’t be expressed as a ratio of integers and are therefore
called irrational numbers. It can be shown, with varying degrees of difﬁculty, that the fol-
lowing are also irrational numbers:
The set of all real numbers is usually denoted by the symbol 
. When we use the word
number without qualiﬁcation, we mean “real number.”
Every number has a decimal representation. If the number is rational, then the corre-
sponding decimal is repeating. For example,
(The bar indicates that the sequence of digits repeats forever.) On the other hand, if the
number is irrational, the decimal is nonrepeating:
If we stop the decimal expansion of any number at a certain place, we get an approxima-
tion to the number. For instance, we can write
where the symbol 
is read “is approximately equal to.” The more decimal places we
retain, the better the approximation we get.
The real numbers can be represented by points on a line as in Figure 1. The positive
direction (to the right) is indicated by an arrow. We choose an arbitrary reference point
,
called the origin, which corresponds to the real number . Given any convenient unit of
measurement, each positive number is represented by the point on the line a distance of
units to the right of the origin, and each negative number 
is represented by the point
units to the left of the origin. Thus every real number is represented by a point on the
line, and every point 
on the line corresponds to exactly one real number. The number
associated with the point 
is called the coordinate of 
and the line is then called a coor-

dinate line, or a real number line, or simply a real line. Often we identify the point with
its coordinate and think of a number as being a point on the real line.
The real numbers are ordered. We say is less than
and write 
if 
is a pos-
itive number. Geometrically this means that 
lies to the left of 
on the number line.
(Equivalently, we say 
is greater than
and write 
.) The symbol 
(or 
)
means that either 
or 
and is read “
is less than or equal to .” For instance,
the following are true inequalities:
In what follows we need to use set notation. A set is a collection of objects, and these
objects are called the elements of the set. If 
is a set, the notation 
means that 
is
an element of , and 
means that 
is not an element of . For example, if 
repre-
sents the set of integers, then 
but 
. If 
and 
are sets, then their union
is the set consisting of all elements that are in or 
(or in both and ). The inter-
section of 
and 
is the set 
consisting of all elements that are in both 
and . In
other words,
is the common part of and . The empty set, denoted by ∅, is the set
that contains no element.
Some sets can be described by listing their elements between braces. For instance, the
set 
consisting of all positive integers less than 7 can be written as
We could also write 
in set-builder notation as
which is read “
is the set of such that is an integer and 
.”
INTERVALS
Certain sets of real numbers, called intervals, occur frequently in calculus and correspond
geometrically to line segments. For example, if 
, the open interval from to con-
sists of all numbers between and and is denoted by the symbol 
. Using set-builder
notation, we can write
Notice that the endpoints of the interval—namely,
and —are excluded. This is indicated
by the round brackets 
and by the open dots in Figure 2. The closed interval from 
to
is the set
Here the endpoints of the interval are included. This is indicated by the square brackets 
and by the solid dots in Figure 3. It is also possible to include only one endpoint in an inter-
val, as shown in Table 1.

TABLE OF INTERVALS
We also need to consider inﬁnite intervals such as
This does not mean that 
(“inﬁnity”) is a number. The notation 
stands for the set
of all numbers that are greater than , so the symbol 
simply indicates that the interval
extends indeﬁnitely far in the positive direction.
INEQUALITIES
When working with inequalities, note the following rules.
RULES FOR INEQUALITIES
1. If 
, then 
.
2. If 
and 
, then 
.
3. If 
and 
, then 
.
4. If 
and 
, then 
.
5. If 
, then 
.
Rule 1 says that we can add any number to both sides of an inequality, and Rule 2 says
that two inequalities can be added. However, we have to be careful with multiplication.
Rule 3 says that we can multiply both sides of an inequality by a positive number, but
| Rule 4 says that if we multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, then we
reverse the direction of the inequality. For example, if we take the inequality 
and
multiply by , we get 
, but if we multiply by 
, we get 
. Finally, Rule 5
says that if we take reciprocals, then we reverse the direction of an inequality (provided
the numbers are positive).
EXAMPLE 1 Solve the inequality 
.
SOLUTION The given inequality is satisﬁed by some values of but not by others. To solve
an inequality means to determine the set of numbers for which the inequality is true.
This is called the solution set.

First we subtract 1 from each side of the inequality (using Rule 1 with 
):
Then we subtract 
from both sides (Rule 1 with 
):
Now we divide both sides by 
(Rule 4 with 
):
These steps can all be reversed, so the solution set consists of all numbers greater than
. In other words, the solution of the inequality is the interval 
.
M
EXAMPLE 2 Solve the inequalities 
.
SOLUTION Here the solution set consists of all values of that satisfy both inequalities.
Using the rules given in (2), we see that the following inequalities are equivalent:
(add 2)
(divide by 3)
Therefore the solution set is 
.
M
EXAMPLE 3 Solve the inequality 
.
SOLUTION First we factor the left side:
We know that the corresponding equation 
has the solutions 2 and 3.
The numbers 2 and 3 divide the real line into three intervals:
On each of these intervals we determine the signs of the factors. For instance,
Then we record these signs in the following chart:
Another method for obtaining the information in the chart is to use test values. For
instance, if we use the test value 
for the interval 
, then substitution in

The polynomial 
doesn’t change sign inside any of the three intervals, so we
conclude that it is positive on 
.
Then we read from the chart that 
is negative when 
. Thus
the solution of the inequality 
is
Notice that we have included the endpoints 2 and 3 because we are looking for values of
such that the product is either negative or zero. The solution is illustrated in Figure 5.

SOLUTION First we take all nonzero terms to one side of the inequality sign and factor the
resulting expression:

and use the
solutions

to divide the real line into four intervals 
,

, and

in the following chart:
Then we read from the chart that the solution set is

Another important property of absolute value, called the Triangle Inequality, is used fre-
quently not only in calculus but throughout mathematics in general.
THE TRIANGLE INEQUALITY If and are any real numbers, then
Observe that if the numbers 
and 
are both positive or both negative, then the two
sides in the Triangle Inequality are actually equal. But if 
and 
have opposite signs,
the left side involves a subtraction and the right side does not. This makes the Triangle
Inequality seem reasonable, but we can prove it as follows.
Notice that

APPENDIX B COORDINATE GEOMETRY AND LINES
COORDINATE GEOMETRY AND LINES
Just as the points on a line can be identiﬁed with real numbers by assigning them coordi-
nates, as described in Appendix A, so the points in a plane can be identiﬁed with ordered
pairs of real numbers. We start by drawing two perpendicular coordinate lines that inter-
sect at the origin 
on each line. Usually one line is horizontal with positive direction to
the right and is called the -axis; the other line is vertical with positive direction upward
and is called the -axis.
Any point 
in the plane can be located by a unique ordered pair of numbers as follows.
Draw lines through 
perpendicular to the - and -axes. These lines intersect the axes in
points with coordinates 
and 
as shown in Figure 1. Then the point 
is assigned the
ordered pair 
. The ﬁrst number is called the x-coordinate of ; the second number
is called the y-coordinate of . We say that 
is the point with coordinates 
, and
we denote the point by the symbol 
. Several points are labeled with their coordi-
nates in Figure 2.
By reversing the preceding process we can start with an ordered pair 
and arrive
at the corresponding point . Often we identify the point 
with the ordered pair 
and
refer to “the point 
.” [Although the notation used for an open interval

same as the notation used for a point 
, you will be able to tell from the context which
meaning is intended.]
This coordinate system is called the rectangular coordinate system or the Cartesian
coordinate system in honor of the French mathematician René Descartes (1596–1650),
even though another Frenchman, Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), invented the principles of
analytic geometry at about the same time as Descartes. The plane supplied with this coor-
dinate system is called the coordinate plane or the Cartesian plane and is denoted by
.
The - and -axes are called the coordinate axes and divide the Cartesian plane into
four quadrants, which are labeled I, II, III, and IV in Figure 1. Notice that the ﬁrst quad-
rant consists of those points whose - and -coordinates are both positive.
EXAMPLE 1 Describe and sketch the regions given by the following sets.
(a)
(b)
(c )
SOLUTION
(a) The points whose -coordinates are 0 or positive lie on the -axis or to the right of it
as indicated by the shaded region in Figure 3(a).
(b) The set of all points with -coordinate 1 is a horizontal line one unit above the -axis
[see Figure 3(b)].
(c) Recall from Appendix A that
The given region consists of those points in the plane whose -coordinates lie between
and . Thus the region consists of all points that lie between (but not on) the hori-
zontal lines 
and 
. [These lines are shown as dashed lines in Figure 3(c) to
indicate that the points on these lines don’t lie in the set.]
M
Recall from Appendix A that the distance between points 
and 
on a number line is
. Thus the distance between points 
and 
on a hor-
izontal line must be 
and the distance between 
and 
on a ver-
tical line must be 
. (See Figure 4.)
To ﬁnd the distance 
between any two points 
and 
, we note
that triangle
in Figure 4 is a right triangle, and so by the Pythagorean Theorem 
we have

LINES
We want to ﬁnd an equation of a given line ; such an equation is satisﬁed by the coordi-
nates of the points on 
and by no other point. To ﬁnd the equation of 
we use its slope,
which is a measure of the steepness of the line.
DEFINITION The slope of a nonvertical line that passes through the points
and 
is
The slope of a vertical line is not deﬁned.
Thus the slope of a line is the ratio of the change in ,
, to the change in ,
. (See
Figure 5.) The slope is therefore the rate of change of y with respect to x. The fact that the
line is straight means that the rate of change is constant.
Figure 6 shows several lines labeled with their slopes. Notice that lines with positive
slope slant upward to the right, whereas lines with negative slope slant downward to the
right. Notice also that the steepest lines are the ones for which the absolute value of the
slope is largest, and a horizontal line has slope 0.
Now let’s ﬁnd an equation of the line that passes through a given point 
and
has slope . A point 
with 
lies on this line if and only if the slope of the line
through 
and 
is equal to ; that is,
This equation can be rewritten in the form
and we observe that this equation is also satisﬁed when 
and 
. Therefore it is
an equation of the given line.

SOLUTION Using 
with

which we can rewrite as
M
EXAMPLE 4 Find an equation of the line through the points 
and 
.
SOLUTION By Deﬁnition 2 the slope of the line is
Using the point-slope form with 
and 
, we obtain
which simpliﬁes to
M
Suppose a nonvertical line has slope 
and -intercept . (See Figure 7.) This means it
intersects the -axis at the point 
, so the point-slope form of the equation of the line,
with 
and 
, becomes
This simpliﬁes as follows.
SLOPE-INTERCEPT FORM OF THE EQUATION OF A LINE An equation of the line
with slope 
and -intercept is
In particular, if a line is horizontal, its slope is 
, so its equation is 
, where
is the -intercept (see Figure 8). A vertical line does not have a slope, but we can write
its equation as 
, where 
is the -intercept, because the -coordinate of every point
on the line is .
Observe that the equation of every line can be written in the form
because a vertical line has the equation 
or 
(
,
,
) and
a nonvertical line has the equation 
or 
(
,
,
). Conversely, if we start with a general ﬁrst-degree equation, that is, an equation
of the form (5), where ,
, and 
are constants and 
and 
are not both 0, then we can
show that it is the equation of a line. If 
, the equation becomes 
or
, which represents a vertical line with -intercept 
. If

can be rewritten by solving for :
and we recognize this as being the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line
(
,
). Therefore an equation of the form (5) is called a linear 
equation or the general equation of a line. For brevity, we often refer to “the line
” instead of “the line whose equation is 
.”
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the equation 
.
SOLUTION Since the equation is linear, its graph is a line. To draw the graph, we can sim-
ply ﬁnd two points on the line. It’s easiest to ﬁnd the intercepts. Substituting 
(the
equation of the -axis) in the given equation, we get 
, so 
is the -intercept.
Substituting 
in the equation, we see that the -intercept is 
. This allows us to
sketch the graph as in Figure 9.
M
EXAMPLE 6 Graph the inequality 
.
SOLUTION We are asked to sketch the graph of the set 
and we do so by
solving the inequality for :
Compare this inequality with the equation 
, which represents a line with
slope 
and -intercept . We see that the given graph consists of points whose 
-coordinates are larger than those on the line 
. Thus the graph is the
region that lies above the line, as illustrated in Figure 10.

PARALLEL AND PERPENDICULAR LINES
Slopes can be used to show that lines are parallel or perpendicular. The following facts are
proved, for instance, in Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus, Fifth Edition by Stewart,
Redlin, and Watson (Thomson BrooksCole, Belmont, CA, 2006).
PARALLEL AND PERPENDICULAR LINES
1. Two nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
2. Two lines with slopes 
and 
are perpendicular if and only if 
;
that is, their slopes are negative reciprocals:

APPENDIX C GRAPHS OF SECOND-DEGREE EQUATIONS
GRAPHS OF SECOND-DEGREE EQUATIONS
In Appendix B we saw that a ﬁrst-degree, or linear, equation 
represents
a line. In this section we discuss second-degree equations such as
which represent a circle, a parabola, an ellipse, and a hyperbola, respectively.
The graph of such an equation in 
and 
is the set of all points 
that satisfy the
equation; it gives a visual representation of the equation. Conversely, given a curve in the
-plane, we may have to ﬁnd an equation that represents it, that is, an equation satisﬁed
by the coordinates of the points on the curve and by no other point. This is the other half
of the basic principle of analytic geometry as formulated by Descartes and Fermat. The
idea is that if a geometric curve can be represented by an algebraic equation, then the rules
of algebra can be used to analyze the geometric problem.
CIRCLES
As an example of this type of problem, let’s ﬁnd an equation of the circle with radius and
center 
. By deﬁnition, the circle is the set of all points 
whose distance from

the center 
is . (See Figure 1.) Thus 
is on the circle if and only if 
. From
the distance formula, we have
or equivalently, squaring both sides, we get
This is the desired equation.
EQUATION OF A CIRCLE An equation of the circle with center 
and 
radius is
In particular, if the center is the origin 
, the equation is
EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the circle with radius 3 and center 
.
SOLUTION From Equation 1 with 
,
, and 
, we obtain
M
EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph of the equation 
by ﬁrst show-
ing that it represents a circle and then ﬁnding its center and radius.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst group the -terms and -terms as follows:
Then we complete the square within each grouping, adding the appropriate constants to
both sides of the equation:
or
Comparing this equation with the standard equation of a circle (1), we see that 
,
, and 
, so the given equation represents a circle with center 
and
radius 
. It is sketched in Figure 2.

PARABOLAS
The geometric properties of parabolas are reviewed in Section 10.5. Here we regard a
parabola as a graph of an equation of the form 
.
EXAMPLE 3 Draw the graph of the parabola 
.
SOLUTION We set up a table of values, plot points, and join them by a smooth curve to
obtain the graph in Figure 3.
.
M
Figure 4 shows the graphs of several parabolas with equations of the form 
for
various values of the number . In each case the vertex, the point where the parabola
changes direction, is the origin. We see that the parabola 
opens upward if 
and downward if 
(as in Figure 5).
Notice that if 
satisﬁes 
, then so does 
. This corresponds to the geo-
metric fact that if the right half of the graph is reﬂected about the -axis, then the left half
of the graph is obtained. We say that the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the -axis if the equation is
unchanged when is replaced by 
.
If we interchange and in the equation 
, the result is 
, which also rep-
resents a parabola. (Interchanging 
and 
amounts to reﬂecting about the diagonal line
.) The parabola 
opens to the right if 
and to the left if 
. (See

satisﬁes 
, then so does 
.
The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the -axis if the equation is
unchanged when is replaced by 
.
EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the region bounded by the parabola
and the line
.
SOLUTION First we ﬁnd the points of intersection by solving the two equations. Substituting
into the equation 
, we get 
, which gives
so 
or 
. Thus the points of intersection are 
and 
, and we draw 
the line 
passing through these points. We then sketch the parabola 
by
referring to Figure 6(a) and having the parabola pass through 
and 
. The
region bounded by 
and 
means the ﬁnite region whose boundaries are
these curves. It is sketched in Figure 7.
M
ELLIPSES
The curve with equation
where 
and 
are positive numbers, is called an ellipse in standard position. (Geometric
properties of ellipses are discussed in Section 10.5.) Observe that Equation 2 is unchanged
if 
is replaced by 
or 
is replaced by 
, so the ellipse is symmetric with respect to
both axes. As a further aid to sketching the ellipse, we ﬁnd its intercepts.
The x-intercepts of a graph are the -coordinates of the points where the graph
intersects the -axis. They are found by setting 
in the equation of the graph.
The y-intercepts are the -coordinates of the points where the graph intersects the
-axis. They are found by setting 
in its equation.
If we set 
in Equation 2, we get 
and so the -intercepts are 
. Setting
, we get 
, so the -intercepts are 
. Using this information, together with
symmetry, we sketch the ellipse in Figure 8. If

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of

SOLUTION We divide both sides of the equation by 144:
The equation is now in the standard form for an ellipse (2), so we have 
,
,
, and 
. The -intercepts are 
; the -intercepts are 
. The graph is
sketched in Figure 9.
M
HYPERBOLAS
The curve with equation
is called a hyperbola in standard position. Again, Equation 3 is unchanged when 
is
replaced by 
or is replaced by 
, so the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both
axes. To ﬁnd the -intercepts we set 
and obtain 
and 
. However, if
we put 
in Equation 3, we get 
, which is impossible, so there is no -inter-
cept. In fact, from Equation 3 we obtain
which shows that 
and so 
. Therefore we have 
or 
.
This means that the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches. It is sketched in
Figure 10.
In drawing a hyperbola it is useful to draw ﬁrst its asymptotes, which are the lines
and 
shown in Figure 10. Both branches of the hyperbola
approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes. This
involves the idea of a limit, which is discussed in Chapter 2. (See also Exercise 55 in
Section 4.5.)
By interchanging the roles of and we get an equation of the form
which also represents a hyperbola and is sketched in Figure 11.

SOLUTION Dividing both sides by 36, we obtain
which is the standard form of the equation of a hyperbola (Equation 3). Since

the -intercepts are

, we have
and the asymptotes are

The hyperbola is sketched in Figure 12.

If 
, a hyperbola has the equation 
(or 
) and is called an
equilateral hyperbola [see Figure 13(a)]. Its asymptotes are 
, which are perpendi-
cular. If an equilateral hyperbola is rotated by

Notice that in shifting the ellipse, we replaced by

in Equation 4

(a) From Equation 1 or 2 we see that to convert from degrees to radians we multiply by

(b) To convert from radians to degrees we multiply by

M
In calculus we use radians to measure angles except when otherwise indicated. The fol-
lowing table gives the correspondence between degree and radian measures of some com-
mon angles.
Figure 1 shows a sector of a circle with central angle 
and radius subtending an arc
with length . Since the length of the arc is proportional to the size of the angle, and since
the entire circle has circumference 
and central angle 
, we have
Solving this equation for and for , we obtain

In particular, putting 
in Equation 3, we see that an angle of 1 rad is the angle sub-
tended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle (see
Figure 2).
EXAMPLE 2
(a) If the radius of a circle is 5 cm, what angle is subtended by an arc of 6 cm?
(b) If a circle has radius 3 cm, what is the length of an arc subtended by a central angle
of 
rad?
SOLUTION
(a) Using Equation 3 with 
and 
, we see that the angle is
(b) With 
cm and 
rad, the arc length is
M
The standard position of an angle occurs when we place its vertex at the origin of a
coordinate system and its initial side on the positive -axis as in Figure 3. A positive angle
is obtained by rotating the initial side counterclockwise until it coincides with the termi-
nal side. Likewise, negative angles are obtained by clockwise rotation as in Figure 4.
Figure 5 shows several examples of angles in standard position. Notice that different
angles can have the same terminal side. For instance, the angles 
,
, and 
have the same initial and terminal sides because
and 
rad represents a complete revolution.

THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
For an acute angle 
the six trigonometric functions are deﬁned as ratios of lengths of sides
of a right triangle as follows (see Figure 6).
This deﬁnition doesn’t apply to obtuse or negative angles, so for a general angle 
in
standard position we let 
be any point on the terminal side of 
and we let be the
distance 
as in Figure 7. Then we deﬁne
Since division by 0 is not deﬁned,
and 
are undeﬁned when 
and 
and 
are undeﬁned when 
. Notice that the deﬁnitions in (4) and (5) are consis-
tent when 
is an acute angle.
If 
is a number, the convention is that 
means the sine of the angle whose radian
measure is . For example, the expression 
implies that we are dealing with an angle
of 3 rad. When ﬁnding a calculator approximation to this number, we must remember to
set our calculator in radian mode, and then we obtain
If we want to know the sine of the angle 
we would write 
and, with our calculator
in degree mode, we ﬁnd that

TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES
A trigonometric identity is a relationship among the trigonometric functions. The most ele-
mentary are the following, which are immediate consequences of the deﬁnitions of the trig-
onometric functions.
For the next identity we refer back to Figure 7. The distance formula (or, equivalently,
the Pythagorean Theorem) tells us that 
. Therefore
We have therefore proved one of the most useful of all trigonometric identities:
If we now divide both sides of Equation 7 by 
and use Equations 6, we get
Similarly, if we divide both sides of Equation 7 by 
, we get
The identities
show that 
is an odd function and 
is an even function. They are easily proved by
drawing a diagram showing 
and 
in standard position (see Exercise 39).
Since the angles 
and 
have the same terminal side, we have
These identities show that the sine and cosine functions are periodic with period 
.
The remaining trigonometric identities are all consequences of two basic identities
called the addition formulas:

N Odd functions and even functions are
discussed in Section 1.1.

The proofs of these addition formulas are outlined in Exercises 85, 86, and 87.
By substituting 
for 
in Equations 12a and 12b and using Equations 10a and 10b,
we obtain the following subtraction formulas:
Then, by dividing the formulas in Equations 12 or Equations 13, we obtain the corre-
sponding formulas for

If we put 
in the addition formulas (12), we get the double-angle formulas:
Then, by using the identity 
, we obtain the following alternate forms of
the double-angle formulas for

If we now solve these equations for 
and 
, we get the following half-angle for-
mulas, which are useful in integral calculus:

Because of the identity
(which can be veriﬁed using Equation 12a), the graph of cosine is obtained by shifting the
graph of sine by an amount 
to the left [see Figure 13(b)]. Note that for both the sine
and cosine functions the domain is

Thus, for all values of , we have

SIGMA NOTATION
A convenient way of writing sums uses the Greek letter 
(capital sigma, corresponding to
our letter S) and is called sigma notation.
DEFINITION If 
are real numbers and 
and are integers
such that 
then
With function notation, Deﬁnition 1 can be written as
Thus the symbol 
indicates a summation in which the letter 
(called the index of 
summation) takes on consecutive integer values beginning with m and ending with n, that
is,
. Other letters can also be used as the index of summation.

We use the method of proof by contradiction. Suppose, if possible, that

Law 2 of limits says that
Therefore, for any

In particular, taking

Since

But this contradicts

SECTION 2.5
THEOREM If 
is a one-to-one continuous function deﬁned on an interval 
,
then its inverse function 
is also continuous.
PROOF
First we show that if 
is both one-to-one and continuous on 
, then it must
be either increasing or decreasing on 
. If it were neither increasing nor decreasing,
then there would exist numbers 
,
, and 
in 
with 
such that 
does not lie between 
and 
. There are two possibilities: either (1) 
lies
between 
and 
or (2) 
lies between 
and 
. (Draw a picture.) In
case (1) we apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to the continuous function 
to get a
number between 
and 
such that 
. In case (2) the Intermediate Value
Theorem gives a number between 
and 
such that 
. In either case we
have contradicted the fact that 
is one-to-one.
Let us assume, for the sake of deﬁniteness, that 
is increasing on 
. We take any
number 
in the domain of 
and we let 
; that is,
is the number in
such that 
. To show that 
is continuous at 
we take any 
such
that the interval 
is contained in the interval 
. Since 
is increasing,
it maps the numbers in the interval 
onto the numbers in the interval
and 
reverses the correspondence. If we let 
denote the
smaller of the numbers 
and 
, then the interval
is contained in the interval 
and so is mapped
into the interval 
by 
. (See the arrow diagram in Figure 1.) We have

SECTION 4.4
In order to give the promised proof of l’Hospital’s Rule, we ﬁrst need a generalization of
the Mean Value Theorem. The following theorem is named after another French mathema-
tician, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857).
CAUCHY’S MEAN VALUE THEOREM Suppose that the functions 
and are con-
tinuous on 
and differentiable on 
, and 
for all in 
. Then
there is a number in 
such that
Notice that if we take the special case in which 
, then 
and Theorem 1
is just the ordinary Mean Value Theorem. Furthermore, Theorem 1 can be proved in a sim-
ilar manner. You can verify that all we have to do is change the function given by Equa-
tion 4.2.4 to the function
and apply Rolle’s Theorem as before.
L’HOSPITAL’S RULE Suppose 
and are differentiable and 
on an open
interval that contains (except possibly at ). Suppose that

(In other words, we have an indeterminate form of type or 
.) Then

PROOF OF 1
Suppose that

. According to Deﬁnition 11.1.2 with 
, there is a positive integer 
such that 
whenever 
. Thus, for 
, we have
If 
, then 
, so 
is a convergent geometric series. Therefore,
by the Comparison Test, the series 
is convergent. Thus the series 
is
absolutely convergent and therefore convergent.
M
PROOF OF 2
Suppose that 
diverges. If is any number such that 
, then
cannot converge because, by part 1, the convergence of 
would imply the
convergence of 
. Therefore 
diverges whenever 
.
M
THEOREM For a power series 
there are only three possibilities:
1. The series converges only when 
.
2. The series converges for all .
3. There is a positive number 
such that the series converges if 
and
diverges if 
.
PROOF
Suppose that neither case 1 nor case 2 is true. Then there are nonzero numbers 
and such that 
converges for 
and diverges for 
. Therefore the set
is not empty. By the preceding theorem, the series diverges if
, so 
for all 
. This says that 
is an upper bound for the set .
Thus, by the Completeness Axiom (see Section 11.1),
has a least upper bound . If
, then 
, so 
diverges. If 
, then 
is not an upper bound for
and so there exists 
such that 
. Since 
,
converges, so by the
preceding theorem 
converges.
M
THEOREM For a power series 
there are only three possibilities:
1. The series converges only when 
.
2. The series converges for all .
3. There is a positive number 
such that the series converges if

diverges if 
.
PROOF
If we make the change of variable 
, then the power series becomes
and we can apply the preceding theorem to this series. In case 3 we have con-
vergence for 
and divergence for 
. Thus we have convergence for
and divergence for

THE LOGARITHM DEFINED AS AN INTEGRAL
Our treatment of exponential and logarithmic functions until now has relied on our intuition,
which is based on numerical and visual evidence. (See Sections 1.5, 1.6, and 3.1.) Here we
use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to give an alternative treatment that provides a
surer footing for these functions.
Instead of starting with 
and deﬁning 
as its inverse, this time we start by deﬁn-
ing 
as an integral and then deﬁne the exponential function as its inverse. You should
bear in mind that we do not use any of our previous deﬁnitions and results concerning
exponential and logarithmic functions.
THE NATURAL LOGARITHM
We ﬁrst deﬁne 
as an integral.
DEFINITION The natural logarithmic function is the function deﬁned by
The existence of this function depends on the fact that the integral of a continuous func-
tion always exists. If 
, then 
can be interpreted geometrically as the area under
the hyperbola 
from 
to 
. (See Figure 1.) For 
, we have
For 
,
and so 
is the negative of the area shown in Figure 2.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) By comparing areas, show that 
.
(b) Use the Midpoint Rule with 
to estimate the value of 
.
SOLUTION
(a) We can interpret 
as the area under the curve 
from 1 to 2. From Figure 3
we see that this area is larger than the area of rectangle 
and smaller than the area
of trapezoid 
. Thus we have
(b) If we use the Midpoint Rule with 
, and 
, we get

logarithmic function).

Using the ﬁrst law of logarithms and Equation 10, we have
Since ln is a one-to-one function, it follows that 
Laws 2 and 3 are proved similarly (see Exercises 6 and 7). As we will soon see,
Law 3 actually holds when is any real number.

the inverse function method. Let

COMPLEX NUMBERS
A complex number can be represented by an expression of the form 
, where and
are real numbers and is a symbol with the property that 
. The complex num-
ber 
can also be represented by the ordered pair 
and plotted as a point in a
plane (called the Argand plane) as in Figure 1. Thus the complex number 
is
identiﬁed with the point 
.
The real part of the complex number 
is the real number 
and the imaginary
part is the real number . Thus the real part of 
is 
and the imaginary part is 
.
Two complex numbers 
and 
are equal if 
and 
; that is, their real
parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. In the Argand plane the horizontal axis
is called the real axis and the vertical axis is called the imaginary axis.
The sum and difference of two complex numbers are deﬁned by adding or subtracting
their real parts and their imaginary parts:
For instance,
The product of complex numbers is deﬁned so that the usual commutative and distributive
laws hold:
Since 
, this becomes
EXAMPLE 1

Division of complex numbers is much like rationalizing the denominator of a rational
expression. For the complex number 
, we deﬁne its complex conjugate to be

denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.

We observe that the solutions of the equation in Example 3 are complex conjugates of
each other. In general, the solutions of any quadratic equation 
with real
coefﬁcients , , and are always complex conjugates. (If is real,
, so is its own
conjugate.)
We have seen that if we allow complex numbers as solutions, then every quadratic equa-
tion has a solution. More generally, it is true that every polynomial equation
of degree at least one has a solution among the complex numbers. This fact is known as
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and was proved by Gauss.
POLAR FORM
We know that any complex number 
can be considered as a point 
and that
any such point can be represented by polar coordinates 
with 
. In fact,
as in Figure 4. Therefore we have
Thus we can write any complex number in the form
where
The angle 
is called the argument of and we write

The polar form of complex numbers gives insight into multiplication and division. Let
be two complex numbers written in polar form. Then
Therefore, using the addition formulas for cosine and sine, we have
This formula says that to multiply two complex numbers we multiply the moduli and add
the arguments. (See Figure 6.)
A similar argument using the subtraction formulas for sine and cosine shows that to
divide two complex numbers we divide the moduli and subtract the arguments.
In particular, taking 
and 
(and therefore

lowing, which is illustrated in Figure 7.

In general, we obtain the following result, which is named after the French mathematician
Abraham De Moivre (1667–1754).
DE MOIVRE’S THEOREM If 
and is a positive integer,
then
This says that to take the nth power of a complex number we take the nth power of the
modulus and multiply the argument by n.

From the fact that sine and cosine have period 
it follows that
Thus
Since this expression gives a different value of 
for 
, 1, 2, . . . ,
, we have the
following.
ROOTS OF A COMPLEX NUMBER Let 
and let be a posi-
tive integer. Then has the distinct th roots
where 
, 1, 2, . . . ,
.
Notice that each of the th roots of has modulus 
. Thus all the th roots 
of lie on the circle of radius 
in the complex plane. Also, since the argument of each
successive th root exceeds the argument of the previous root by 
, we see that the 
th roots of are equally spaced on this circle.

plane.
SOLUTION In trigonometric form,

COMPLEX EXPONENTIALS
We also need to give a meaning to the expression 
when 
is a complex num-
ber. The theory of inﬁnite series as developed in Chapter 11 can be extended to the case
where the terms are complex numbers. Using the Taylor series for 
(11.10.11) as our
guide, we deﬁne
and it turns out that this complex exponential function has the same properties as the real
exponential function. In particular, it is true that
If we put 
, where is a real number, in Equation 4, and use the facts that
. . .
we get
Here we have used the Taylor series for 
and 
(Equations 11.10.16 and 11.10.15).
The result is a famous formula called Euler’s formula:
Combining Euler’s formula with Equation 5, we get
EXAMPLE 8 Evaluate:

a maximum point. These humps get ﬂatter as c increases until at
two of the humps disappear and there is only one mini-
mum point. This single hump then moves to the right and
approaches the origin as c increases.
31. The hump gets larger and moves to the right.
33. If
