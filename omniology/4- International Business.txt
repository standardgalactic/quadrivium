 In the Sixth Edition, in the strategy section of Part Three, 
there is a new chapter on “Innovation, Entrepreneurship 
and ‘Born Global’ Firms.” Innovation is the lifeblood of 
any firm, large or small. By persistently creating new and 
better products and services, new production processes, 
management practices and business models, they can 
stay ahead of the competition. Multinational firms have 
an added competitive advantage. Small firms lack the 
scale and scope advantages of large multinationals but 
can still benefit from a diversity of options for sourcing 
inputs and accessing markets if they internationalize. 
However, they arguably face greater challenges and 
risks than large firms when they do expand abroad. 
Those that succeed against the odds provide lessons 
for all entrepreneurs and innovators. Five new cases 
feature in this chapter: “Facebook: Global and Local?”, 
“Innovation Networks at IBM,” “Spreadshirt: Open 
Innovation,” “GE Healthcare: Product Innovation 
Driven by Local Needs in India,” and “SetJam: the Mini 
Multinational.” 
 The book is also reorganized into five parts, of which 
three parts focus on strategies. Part One  introduces the 
world of international business. Part Two  discusses 
the environment of international business. Part Three 
focuses on international business strategies. Part Four 
deals with functional area strategies. Part Five pays 
 specific attention to regional strategies. The major 
changes are in Part Three which now include the 
new  Chapter 11  “Innovation, Entrepreneurship and 
‘Born Global’ Firms,” and the former  Chapter 15  
“Corporate Strategy and National Competitiveness” 
which now becomes  Chapter 10 . This chapter  discusses 
the  integration and responsiveness framework of 
 multinational business strategy as well as the  diamond 
and double diamond approach to international 
 competitiveness. This now provides a more logical 
development of the key frameworks in the text which 
are: the FSA/CSA framework in  Chapter 2  and through-
out Parts One and Two; integration and responsiveness 
in  Chapter 10  and throughout Parts Three and Four; 
the diamond and double diamond in  Chapter 10 ; and 
the five-partners flagship framework in  Chapter 22 . 
 In addition, all tables and figures in the text and cases 
have been updated. As listed in the Guide to the Case 
Studies, all the cases have been updated and several new 
cases have been added. About 75 of the 105 cases have 
been revised and/or updated. There are seven new case 
studies (five new cases for the new  Chapter 11 ), one 
new case each for  Chapters 12  and  22  respectively. At 
the end of each chapter the bibliographies have been 
substantially revised and updated.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
and some researchers have raised the question of how the same rivalry determinant can 
both include multinationality for global industries and yet exclude it for multidomestic 
industries. As Dunning notes, “There is ample evidence to suggest that MNEs are influ-
enced in their competitiveness by the configuration of the diamond in other than their 
home countries, and that this in turn may impinge upon the competitiveness of home 
countries.” 13 For example, Nestlé earns 98 percent of its sales outside Switzerland; 14 thus, 
the Swiss diamond of competitive advantage is less relevant than that of the countries in 
which Nestlé operates. This is true not only for MNEs in Switzerland but for 95 percent of 
the world’s MNEs as well. For example, virtually all of Canada’s large multinationals rely 
on sales in the United States and other triad markets. Indeed, it could be argued that the 
US diamond is more relevant for Canada’s industrial multinationals than Canada’s own 
diamond, since more than 70 percent of Canadian MNE sales take place in the United 
States. Other nations with MNEs based on small home diamonds include Australia, New 
Zealand, Finland, and most, if not all, Asian and Latin American countries as well as a 
large number of other small countries. Even small nations in the EU, such as Denmark, 
have been able to overcome the problem of a small domestic market by gaining access to 
one of the triad markets. So in applying Porter’s framework to international business at 
large, one conclusion is irrefutable:  Different diamonds need to be constructed and analyzed 
for different countries .

 In what way does ABB’s strategy incorporate Porter’s four country-specific 
determinants and two external variables? 
 The strategy incorporates Porter’s country-specific determinants as part of a well-
formulated global strategy designed to tap the strengths of various markets. For example, 
the company draws on the factor conditions and demand conditions in Europe to support 
its power and automation business. It also draws on supporting industries to help sustain 
its worldwide competitive advantage in that industry. At the same time the company’s 
strategy, structure, and rivalry are designed to help it compete at the local level. The strat-
egy incorporates the external variable of government by considering relations between 
countries as a lubricant for worldwide economic integration. It addresses the variable 
of chance by operating globally and thus reducing the likelihood that a war or a regional 
recession will have a major negative effect on operations. The firm’s heavy focus on core 
technologies and R&D also helps minimize this chance variable. 
 Researchers have recently begun using Porter’s single diamond as a basis for analyzing the 
international competitiveness of smaller countries. This approach builds on Porter’s theme 
of corporate strategy and process as a source of competitive advantage for a nation.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 In this chapter we are going to define the boundaries of the field 
of international business in an introductory overview of the main 
themes of this book. We will then examine trade and foreign direct 
investment, as well as the emergence of the triad economic blocs of 
North America, the European Union (EU), and Japan. We will then 
examine some of the worldwide economic and political changes 
that are taking place and look at how technology is altering the way 
international business is conducted. We will also study some of the 
approaches being used by multinational enterprises both to establish 
and to maintain their competitive advantage. In the last part of the 
chapter, we will present the framework that we are going to use in 
our study of international business. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Define  the terms international business and multinational 
enterprise.  
 2  Discuss  the two primary ways in which international business 
occurs: trade and foreign direct investment.  
 3  Examine  the impact of the triad on international trade and 
investment.  
 4  Describe  the current state of world economies and the role of 
government and trade regulations in the conduct of international 
business.  
 5  Discuss  the importance of technology and the role of small and 
medium-sized enterprises in the international business arena.  
 6  Examine  how multinational enterprises use triad/regional 
strategies to compete effectively in the international marketplace.  
 7  Discuss  the determinants of national competitive advantage.  
 8  Present  the model that will be used in this text for studying 
international business.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
 Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, Asea Brown Boveri 
(ABB) is one of Europe’s major industrial firms. Since the 
merger in 1987 that created it, ABB has been acquiring or 
taking minority positions in a large number of companies 
throughout the world. In recent years it has purchased 
Westinghouse’s transmission and distribution operations 
and Combustion Engineering, the manufacturer of power 
generation and process automation equipment.  
 ABB Ltd (ABB) provides power and automation technologies 
for its utility and industrial customers. It focuses on power 
transmission, distribution, and power-plant automation
and serves electric, gas, and water utilities, as well as 
industrial and commercial customers. ABB also delivers 
automation systems that measure, control, protect, and 
optimize plant applications across a range of industries. By 
2009, the conglomerate, which employs over 116,000 people 
worldwide, had annual revenues of $31.797 billion; 41.18 per-
cent of its revenues comes from Europe, 19.03 percent from 
the Americas, and 27.31 percent from Asia. The remainder, 
12.48 percent, comes from Africa and the Middle East. 
 ABB operates on both local and global terms. On the one 
hand it attempts to maintain deep local roots wherever it 
operates so that it can modify both products and operations 
for that market. For example, managers are trained to 
adapt to cultural differences and to learn how to communi-
cate effectively with local customers. At the same time the 
company works to be global and to make products that can 
be sold anywhere in the world because their technology 
and quality give them a worldwide appeal. 
 A good example of a business that demonstrates ABB’s 
advantages is products and services. In 2009, the com-
pany generates $9.370 billion revenues in power products 
(29.47 percent), $7.897 billion in automation products 
(24.84 percent), $7.150 billion in process automation 
(22.49 percent), $6.356 billion in power systems (20 per-
cent), and the balance in robotics. This is possible for four 
reasons: (1) ABB’s research and development makes it a 
leader in power and automation technology, enabling it to 
develop and build products and services throughout the 
world; (2) its operations are structured to take advantage 
of economies of scale and thus keep prices competitive; 
(3) it adapts to local environments and works closely with 
customers so that it is viewed as a national rather than a 
foreign company; and (4) it works closely with companies 
in other countries that are favored by their own government 
but need assistance in financing and producing equipment 
for that market. As a result, ABB is able to capitalize on 
its technological and manufacturing expertise and develop 
competitive advantages in both triad and non-triad markets. 
 In some cases ABB has gone so far as to take an owner-
ship position in companies located in emerging economic 
markets. For example, the firm purchased 76 percent of 
Zamech, Poland’s leading manufacturer of steam turbines, 
transmission gears, marine equipment, and metal cast-
ings. And it has bought into two other Polish firms that 
make a wide range of generating equipment and electric 
drives. ABB reorganized these firms into profit centers, 
transferring its own expertise to local operations, and 
developing worldwide quality standards and controls for 
production. In Mexico, ABB acquired FIP SA in 2001, an 
oil and gas production equipment company. In October 
2009, ABB Ltd. acquired Sinai Engineering Corporation to 
enhance its presence and capabilities in Western Canada. 
In January 2011, the Company acquired Baldor Electric 
Company (the United States) at the value of $4.2 billion, 
including $1.1 billion of net debt. These acquisitions also 
need to be better incorporated into its structure. 
 ABB works hard to be a “good citizen” of every country in 
which it operates, while also maintaining its supranational 
status. As a result, the company is proving that it is possible 
to have worldwide operations and local strategies that 
work harmoniously.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 1   International business is the study of transactions taking place across national borders 
for the purpose of satisfying the needs of individuals and organizations. Two of the most 
common types of international business activity are export/import and foreign direct 
investment (FDI). In recent years both have been on the rise. Much of this is a result 
of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) that are headquartered in triad countries. 
In particular, triad members account for most of the worldwide trade and FDI. The 
majority of trade is intra-regional.  
 2   Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often function as the backbone of large 
MNEs, efficiently providing goods and services that are integrated into the production 
process of large MNEs. SMEs also compete with MNEs in niche markets.  
 3   Trade regulation has become an important issue in international business. Today the 
World Trade Organization is the major group responsible for governing the inter-
national trading system.  
 4   Changes taking place in both communication and production technologies are trans-
forming the way in which MNEs do business.  
 5   One way in which MNEs are competing is by drawing up strategies that focus on regions 
and geographic areas, thus ensuring that they are addressing the needs of their local 
customers. Another way is by continuing to be innovative. A third is by maintaining 
competitive position by addressing the determinants of national competitive advantage: 
(a) creating the necessary factor conditions; (b) having strong local demand for the 
goods and services that are being produced; (c) having related and supporting industries 
that are internationally competitive; and (d) having a suitable strategy and structure and 
domestic rivalry that encourages continued innovation.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Nokia and Ericsson 
 Based in one of the world’s smallest countries, the largest 
producer of mobile phones is Finland’s Nokia. Founded in 
1865, Nokia was a major manufacturer of paper products 
before it transformed itself into a high-tech producer of 
electronic products, especially cellular phones, starting 
in the 1970s. By 2009, Nokia was the largest company in 
Finland and also among the world’s largest 500 companies 
with sales of US $56.966 billion. Production facilities span 
13 countries, and R&D is performed in 13 locations world-
wide. It generates sales in 130 countries and employs 
some 132,427 people. In 2009, Nokia derived 36 percent of 
its total sales from Europe, 38 percent from Asia–Pacific, 
including China, the Middle East and Africa 14 percent, Latin 
America 7 percent, and North America 5 percent. However, 
Nokia’s 2009 sales dropped 23 percent compared to 2008 
sales as industry watchers comment that Nokia has been 
falling behind its competitors (for example, Apple) for some 
years. In February 2011, Nokia announced a strategic alli-
ance whereby it plans to abandon its Symbian smartphone 
operating system in favour of Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7, 
in order to challenge the growing popularity of phones pow-
ered by Google’s Android operating software and the Apple 
iPhone. The Apple’s iPhone (driven by Apple’s proprietary 
iOS) has captured the top of the smartphone market while 
devices powered by Android—free, open source software—
are now available from a number of manufacturers. In fact, 
there are now more smartphones powered by Android than 
iPhones in the hands of users. The iPhone benefits from 
a “cool” and desirable image and a huge store of proved 
applications, while Android phones are cheaper and have an 
impressive user interface. RIM’s BlackBerry e-mail devices, 
which enjoyed a very short “cycle of dominance,” may also 
have missed the leading position. Taiwanese smartphone 
maker HTC is the world’s third-biggest mobile phone maker 
by market value. Samsung (Korea) is one of leading players 
in the fast growing smartphone and tablet PC market. 
 From the beginning, Nokia has pursued foreign sales. 
In 2009, Nokia derives less than 1 percent of its total sales 
from Finland, and 99 percent are foreign sales. This inter-
nationalization strategy is necessary because Finland has 
only 3 million people and only a small share of its sales 
originates in its home base. So Nokia became the mobile 
phone leader in Scandinavia, despite competition from 
Ericsson of Sweden. From there it progressed to becoming 
the leader in the UK and then the rest of Europe, and formed 
strategic alliances with US distributors such as Radio Shack 
and US telecom companies like AT&T. The firm has also 
developed special phones for Chinese and Japanese users. 
Nokia spends a large amount on R&D, which allows it to 
continuously introduce new handset models. For instance 
it introduced handsets with MP3 technology that allows a 
mobile phone to also be a portable music player. Nokia has 
a joint venture with the German electronic and electrical 
engineering Siemens AG to form Nokia Siemens Networks. 
 L. M. Ericsson employs more than 82,493 people and has 
sales of US $26.997 billion in the 140 countries in which it 
operates. In 1997, Ericsson was the world’s largest pro-
ducer of digital mobile phones. In 2009, 1.98 percent of its 
sales are from Sweden, 19.61 percent in Western Europe, 
24.57 per cent in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East 
and Africa, 31.86 percent in Asia Pacific (including China 
and India), 12.28 percent in North America, and 9.70 per-
cent in South America. Unlike Nokia, which started as a 
paper and rubber producer, Ericsson has always been in 
telecommunications, beginning in 1876 as a telephone 
manufacturer. It has always been innovative; today, one in 
four employees works in R&D. In other areas of business 
it has developed telephone switches in which it competes 
with firms such as Siemens Nokia Networks, France’s 
Alcatel Lucent and Japan’s NEC. Ericsson was well positioned 
to benefit from the telecom deregulation of the 1980s 
and 1990s. This has created new demand, especially for 
new equipment like mobile phones in areas with few local 
monopoly producers. 
 Ericsson has formed alliances with Intel, Hewlett-
Packard, and Texas Instruments. These firms act as key 
suppliers of components and products that Ericsson uses 
for voice and data transmission. The company’s relative 
weakness, compared to Nokia and Motorola, is its brand 
name. Ericsson has strong production technology but 
needs to improve on its marketing side. 
 Companies like Ericsson and Nokia will benefit from the 
alliance between AT&T and British Telecom (BT), and that 
between Sprint, France Telecom, and Deutsche Telekom. 
Such big alliances help set standardized services to which 
mobile phone producers can respond efficiently. In the 
future, mobile phones will become even smaller, but the 
two producers from small countries, Nokia of Finland and 
Ericsson of Sweden, will become even bigger.

CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 REAL CASE 
 Panasonic and Philips 
 In terms of triad-based competition, the 1980s saw the 
emergence of Japanese firms in the consumer electronics 
industry. One of the major companies is Panasonic, which 
was formerly known as Matsushita. The firm was initially 
successful with color TVs, but its best-known product has 
been the video cassette recorder (VCR), a field it dominates 
by using the VHS system instead of the Sony Betamax for-
mat VCR and others produced by European and US rivals. 
Paradoxically, the VCR was developed in California in 1956 
by a US firm, Ampex, but the product development and 
distribution was captured by the clever global strategy of 
Matsushita/Panasonic. 
 To dominate world business in VCRs, by that time, 
Matsushita managed to make the VHS format the industry 
standard. The company achieved this not just by its own 
massive production and worldwide sales, but by licens-
ing the VHS format to other MNEs such as Hitachi, Sharp, 
Mitsubishi, and even the major European-based rival, 
Philips. Other companies such as GE, RCA, and Zenith 
(which sold VCRs under their own brand names) were tied 
into the VHS format because of the production and process 
technology retained by Matsushita in its strong Japanese 
home base. The company’s massive global economies of 
scale enabled it to cut VCR prices by 50 percent over its 
first five years. 
 In contrast, Philips was in desperate trouble by the 
1980s. Built up in the interwar period of protectionism and 
strong government regulation, the company had devel-
oped a very highly decentralized organizational structure. 
Individual national country managers held the power in 
Philips, and they were slow to respond to the Japanese 
threat in the postwar period. As a result, Philips lacked 
economies of scale and its radios, TVs, and VCRs were too 
expensive compared to comparable Japanese products. 
Philips had more than 600 manufacturing plants across the 
world, all developing products for local markets. However, 
the challenge facing the firm was how to restructure its 
entire business away from locally responsive national 
organizations toward a more integrated and leaner manu-
facturer capable of reaping the necessary economies of 
scale through standard global production. 
 In essence, the Japanese changed the rules of the 
game in the consumer electronics business. Matsushita/ 
Panasonic, as a centralized, high-quality, low-price, and 
innovative company, was able to beat the decentralized 
and nationally responsive European firm. One tactic used 
by European firms was to lobby their governments for 
protection in the form of antidumping actions and tougher 
customs inspection of Japanese products. But such “shel-
ters” only bought some breathing room before MNEs such 
as Philips restructured and fitted their organizational 
capabilities to the required industry strategy. 
 Finally, the response of Matsushita/ Panasonic to more 
protection has been to switch overseas sales from export 
to foreign direct investment (FDI). With FDI the firm has 
been able to evade European trade barriers such as anti-
dumping actions. For example, today it manufactures in a 
number of European countries including the UK, where it 
has a major plant in Cardiff, Wales. At the same time this 
means that Matsushita/Panasonic must make its foreign 
subsidiaries as effective as possible by encouraging local 
initiatives, and this strategy can conflict with its inter-
nationally centralized Japanese-based management cul-
ture. In short, the very government regulations that have 
made Philips too decentralized are now being reapplied 
half a century later to make Matsushita/Panasonic less 
global and more local.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 In this chapter we are going to define the boundaries of the field 
of international business in an introductory overview of the main 
themes of this book. We will then examine trade and foreign direct 
investment, as well as the emergence of the triad economic blocs of 
North America, the European Union (EU), and Japan. We will then 
examine some of the worldwide economic and political changes 
that are taking place and look at how technology is altering the way 
international business is conducted. We will also study some of the 
approaches being used by multinational enterprises both to establish 
and to maintain their competitive advantage. In the last part of the 
chapter, we will present the framework that we are going to use in 
our study of international business. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Define  the terms international business and multinational 
enterprise. 
 2  Discuss  the two primary ways in which international business 
occurs: trade and foreign direct investment.  
 3  Examine  the impact of the triad on international trade and 
investment. 
 4  Describe  the current state of world economies and the role of 
government and trade regulations in the conduct of international 
business. 
 5  Discuss  the importance of technology and the role of small and 
medium-sized enterprises in the international business arena.  
 6  Examine  how multinational enterprises use triad/regional 
strategies to compete effectively in the international marketplace.  
 7  Discuss  the determinants of national competitive advantage.  
 8  Present  the model that will be used in this text for studying 
international business.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Coca-Cola is the largest-selling soft drink in the world, but 
sales vary by nation. For example, Americans consume 
almost 30 gallons (135 liters) of Coke annually, in contrast 
to Europeans who drink less than half this amount, and in 
some countries, such as France, Italy, and Portugal, the 
average is in the range of 10 gallons. In the 1990s, Coke 
took a number of steps to increase its European sales. 
  One of these was to replace local franchisors who had 
become too complacent with more active, market-driven 
sellers. In France, for example, Pernod, a Coca-Cola fran-
chisee, was forced to sell some of its operations back to 
Coke which, in turn, appointed a new marketing manager 
for the country. In addition, Coke’s price was lowered and 
advertising was sharply increased. As a result, per capita 
consumption in France went up. 
 In England, Beecham and Grand Metropolitan used to 
be Coke’s national bottlers but that was turned over to 
Cadbury Schweppes, most famous for its Schweppes 
 mixers. The latter immediately began a series of marketing 
programs that resulted in sales tripling within three years. 
 In Germany the pace has been even faster. Beginning 
in the early 1990s Coke identified Germany as one of its 
primary targets and began building a distribution network 
there to both package and sell Coke locally. Meanwhile, 
throughout the entire country the company has taken even 
bolder steps including the replacement of an inefficient 
bottling network and the institution of a new, well-financed 
marketing campaign. As a result, Germany became Coke’s 
largest and most profitable market in Europe. 
 But all of this came at a price. For example, some 
government agencies and companies expressed concern 
about Coke’s overriding emphasis on cost control and 
market growth and its willingness to push aside those 
who are unable to meet these goals. As a result, the 
European Union’s Competition Department was asked 
to investigate possible anti-competitiveness tactics. 
Meanwhile, in the UK, the British Monopolies and Mergers 
Commission investigated Coke regarding its joint venture 
with Schweppes, and San Pellegrino, the mineral water 
company, filed a complaint with the Commission of the 
European Communities, contending that Coca-Cola abused 
its dominant position by giving discounts to Italian retailers 
who promised to stock only Coke. 
 Yet none of these actions stopped Coke’s efforts to 
establish a strong foothold in Europe. As the European 
Union eliminated all internal tariffs, it became possible for 
a chain store with operations in France, Germany, Italy, 
and the Netherlands to buy soft drinks from the lowest-
cost supplier on the continent and not have to worry about 
paying import duties for shipping them to the retail stores. 
Low cost and rapid delivery were going to be key stra-
tegic factors for success. Coke believes that its current 
European strategy puts it in an ideal competitive position 
against competitors. 
 Recent developments shed some doubt on whether 
the company will be as successful as it is forecasting. 
Worldwide market growth has been flat and there has been 
a move away from carbonated drinks. In Eastern Europe; it 
is the market for bottled water that is booming. Between 
1998 and 2004, per capita consumption of bottled water 
in Eastern Europe doubled. Although Coca-Cola Water 
Division is one of four major players, it is not the market 
leader and smaller, local competitors account for a large 
portion of the market. Other efforts to develop innovative, 
non-carbonated products have not proven very success-
ful. The company knows that its future growth is going to 
depend heavily on its ability to supplement its current prod-
uct line with new offerings such as vitamin-enriched drinks, 
and perhaps coffee and tea offerings. Worst of all perhaps, 
a few years ago the company began centralizing control 
and encouraging consolidation among its bottling partners. 
Coke believed that by making all key operating decisions in 
Atlanta, it could drive up profitability. Unfortunately, at the 
same time that it was pushing for this centralized type of 
operation, regional markets began demanding that the com-
pany be more responsive to local needs. In short, Coke was 
going global while the market wanted it to go local. 
 Coke is now trying to turn things around. In particular, 
the firm is implementing three principles that are designed 
to make it more locally responsive. First, the company is

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
instituting a strategy of “think local, act local” by putting 
increased decision making in the hands of local  managers. 
Second, the firm is focusing itself as a pure marketing 
company and pushing its brands on a regional basis and 
local basis rather than on a worldwide basis. Third, Coke is 
now working to become a model citizen by reaching out to 
local communities and getting involved in civic and chari-
table activities. 
 Europe remains an important market for Coke, which 
derives about a quarter of its revenues from the region, 
about the same as the Asia–Pacific region. North America, 
though the dominant market, accounts for just under a 
third of Coke’s revenues. Indeed, Coke now attracts both 
investors and consumers in Europe as it listed on the 
Paris NYSE Euronext from May 2011. Similar to many sec-
ondary listings, this move to Paris is more about raising 
awareness than cash. John Brock, chairman and chief 
executive, said the secondary listing “reflects our com-
mitment to Europe and will provide convenient access” for 
European investors. 
 In the past, Coke succeeded as a multinational because 
of its understanding and appeal to global commonalities. 
Today, it is trying to hold its market share by better under-
standing and appealing to local differences.

 International business is a wonderful and exciting ﬁ eld of study. Today it can be said that 
all business is international business. The days are over when an understanding of domes-
tic business alone was sufﬁ cient to prosper. In this book we will examine the basic data on 
business activities, operations, supply chains, strategies, structures, ethics, etc., and we will 
ﬁ nd that all of these have strong international elements. In other words, international busi-
ness is not just the study of international trade, foreign direct investment, international 
joint ventures, cross-cultural management, international organizations, etc., although these 
topics will all be covered in the book. Today international business is much more than this: 
it is the study of the international aspects of business itself. Therefore, in this book, two 
parallel lines of thinking will be developed. 
  Country and firm factors 
 First, the book will help students to review and understand the classic components of an 
international business course. We will deﬁ ne and discuss country-level issues on inter-
national business. These will cover the importance and growth of international trade 
(imports and exports) and of foreign direct investment (FDI). We will deﬁ ne these terms 
and provide summary data on them later in this chapter. Next, we will discuss the nature 
and role of international institutions such as the World Bank, World Trade Organization, 
United Nations agencies, etc. We will deﬁ ne many of these terms later in this chapter and 
then explore them in greater detail in  Chapter 4  which deals with the role of governments as 
they affect international business. We also discuss the relevance of the regional economies 
of the European Union, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the major 
 OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
economies in the Asia–Paciﬁ c. We refer to these as the broad “triad” regions, and again we 
will deﬁ ne these in more detail later in this chapter and, then discuss their importance in 
 Chapter 3 . 
 Second, the major focus of this book is upon the key actor on the stage of inter-
national business: the multinational enterprise (MNE). The MNE is defined later in this 
chapter, and, in  Chapter 2 , as a firm operating across national borders. The world’s 
largest 500 MNEs dominate international business. It has been shown that they account 
for 90 percent of the world’s stock of FDI and that they also undertake over half the 
world’s trade. 1  In addition to these extremely large MNEs (with sales of $15 billion or 
more) there are thousands of smaller MNEs. There are also thousands of mainly small 
domestic firms. These small MNEs and small domestic firms are often parts of clusters 
(a type of network) affiliated with one or more of the world’s large MNEs. The nature of 
these business clusters is analyzed in  Chapter 22  of this book using the “flagship” frame-
work of international business. Other forms of business organization besides the MNE 
are also studied. These include: international joint ventures, licensing agreements, and 
franchises. We explore the timing of foreign entry for these types of organizational forms 
starting in  Chapter 2  and then in later parts of the book. We also report new research on 
the relationship between the degree of multinationality and the performance of MNEs 
and other types of organizations. 
 The preceding two paragraphs indicate that the book will have a focus upon country 
factors and firm factors. In  Chapter 2  we develop a framework to integrate these two basic 
aspects of international business. We look into the advantages and disadvantages of the 
home-country effect. For example, when countries such as Canada or Sweden are endowed 
with bountiful natural resources, for example, trees, then this is likely to lead to the growth 
of pulp and paper and newsprint firms. Similarly, countries with oil deposits will generate 
energy firms. We call these country-specific advantages (CSAs). Of course some countries, 
for example, Japan, have no oil, so we can say that Japan has a country disadvantage in 
energy (a negative CSA). In a similar manner, using modern concepts about the strategic 
advantages of firms, we can use the concept of firm-specific advantages (FSAs). These are 
unique assets proprietary to the firm, sometimes called capabilities and/or core competen-
cies in the resourced-based view of the firm.  
  International competitiveness and firm strategy 
 In order to examine the country effect in full detail, we will introduce issues in international 
competitiveness. We will examine the home-country “diamond” model popularized by 
Michael Porter. 2  This diamond framework is relevant for mainly large countries, but for 
smaller economies a double-diamond framework will be introduced in  Chapter 10 . 
 In a similar vein some of the complexities of international management strategy can 
be captured through use of an economic integration and national responsiveness frame-
work. This integration responsiveness model of international management strategy is also 
introduced in  Chapter 10 and is then used as a basis for the remaining sections of the 
book. We also discuss organizational structures which are used by MNEs and other types 
of businesses. 
 To summarize, building upon the distinction between country and firm factors in this 
book we adopt a strategic management focus. This serves to integrate and simplify the 
many topics relevant in the study of international business. To illustrate the relevance of 
the strategic management approach to international business we include over a hundred 
case studies in the book. There are five of these in each chapter. In addition, in the text 
itself we discuss many other examples of individual firm strategy and country-level 
institutions.

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
 Globalization 
 International business is sometimes confused with globalization. We deﬁ ne international 
business as the study of country-level and ﬁ rm-level factors, as outlined above. However, 
globalization needs to be more narrowly deﬁ ned. In its extreme form, globalization means 
the existence of a perfectly integrated world economic system. In such a global system there 
would be perfect mobility of ﬁ nancial capital, goods, and people. There would be a glo-
bal commonality whereby identical values and tastes would occur. Yet, such a situation of 
perfect integration (technically called homogenization) does not exist. In fact, the data in 
this book will demonstrate that there is not even a trend toward globalization; nor do most 
ﬁ rms have a global strategy, deﬁ ned as selling the same product at the same price around 
the world. Instead, there remain strong barriers to the integration of the world’s goods mar-
kets and people tend to be highly immobile (only ﬁ nancial markets appear to be global). 
Government regulation, at the national and regional levels, serves to segment country and 
regional markets. As a result, international business needs to study the nature of regions 
and the importance of regional strategy.  
 Regionalization 
 This book on international business differs from all other textbooks in this area because of its 
focus on the reality of regionalization. Most of the world’s business activity takes place across 
countries but within the broad triad regions of Europe, North America, and Asia–Paciﬁ c. 
Indeed, the core triad of the EU, NAFTA, and Japan account for the majority of world trade 
and FDI. Of the world’s 500 largest ﬁ rms, the vast majority are home-region based. There 
are only a handful of “global” ﬁ rms operating at a signiﬁ cant level in all three broad regions 
of the triad. In fact the world’s 500 largest ﬁ rms average 77 percent of their sales (and assets) 
in their home region. (We discuss these data in  Chapter 3 .) This indicates that international 
business needs to be analyzed more carefully than is the tradition in international business 
textbooks. We are proud that this book offers students up-to-date data and new insights 
into the true nature of globalization and the reality of regional business activity. Again, these 
themes are illustrated in the dozens of cases reported throughout the book. It will be seen 
that the majority of the world’s MNEs have a regional strategy rather than a global strategy. 
 International business   is the study of transactions taking place across national borders for 
the purpose of satisfying the needs of individuals and organizations. These economic trans-
actions consist of trade, as in the case of exporting and importing, and foreign direct invest-
ment, as in the case of companies funding operations in other countries. Over half of all 
world trade and approximately 80 percent of all foreign direct investment is made by the 
500 largest ﬁ rms in the world. These companies, called   multinational enterprises (MNEs) , 
are ﬁ rms that are headquartered in one country but have operations in one or more other 
countries. Who are these ﬁ rms? Some of them you know by name because you have used 
their products or seen their advertising. In order of annual revenue, here is a list of the 
largest 20 MNEs that each grossed more than $125 billion in 2009 (Fortune Global 500, 
2010 ranking, data are for 2009):

 20  Allianz (Germany) 
 A close look at this list shows that 17 of these 20 companies come from one of three 
geographic regions: the United States, the EU, or Japan. We call this the core “triad.” And 
of these 17 companies, 6 were from the United States, 9 from the EU, and 2 from Japan. 
It is noteworthy that 3 of the top 20 companies are from China. The list helps point up 
an important fact and one that we will continue to emphasize throughout the book: com-
panies from one of these core three geographic regions account for most of the world’s 
international business. 
 In the next section we will discuss the core triad in more detail. It is important that we 
include Japan in the core triad as in Asia there are 71 firms from Japan and 46 from China 
in the top 500. Overall there are 155 firms from Asia, 160 from the EU(15), and 152 from 
North America. So later, from  Table   2.1   , we can develop the concept of the “broad” triad 
of the EU, North America, and Asia. The implications of this statement will be explained 
in greater detail in this next section where a brief overview of the world of international 
business is provided. We then elaborate on the triad theme in  Chapter 3 .  
 There are thousands of MNEs that collectively perform a wide range of operations and 
services. 3  However, if we were to examine what these companies are doing, we would dis-
cover that much of their activity could be classiﬁ ed into two major categories: (1) exports 
and imports and (2) foreign direct investment (FDI). International business operations are 
discussed in more detail in  Chapter 2 . 
 Exports and imports 
 International trade   is the exchange of goods and services across international borders and 
is also known as exports and imports.   Exports   are goods and services produced by a ﬁ rm 
in one country and then sent to another country. For example, many companies in China 
export clothing and other textile products to the United States.   Imports are goods and 
services produced in one country and brought in by another country. Japan, for example, 
is a major importer of petroleum because it must rely on outside suppliers for all of its 
energy needs. For the UK, the City of London generates exports of ﬁ nancial services that are 
“invisibles” in the British balance of payments. (See the Appendix to  Chapter 6  for further 
discussion of the balance of payments.)    
 In most cases people think of exports and imports as physical goods (clothes, oil, cars), 
but they also include services such as those provided by international airlines, cruise lines, 
reservation agencies, and hotels. Indeed, many international business experts now recog-
nize that one of the major US exports is its entertainment and pop culture such as movies, 
television, and related offerings.

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
  Table   1.1    provides a breakdown of worldwide trade in a recent year. The data show that 
the EU is the world’s single largest exporter, followed by Asia and North America. These 
data are for 2008, when there were 15 member countries in the EU (there are now 27). 
We call them the EU15. The EU is also the largest importer, followed by Asia and North 
America. If you were to investigate further, you would find that the majority of this export 
and import activity involves manufactured goods such as industrial machinery, computers, 
cars, televisions, Consumer electronics, and other electronic goods. However, as will be 
seen later, an increasing proportion of world trade is in services.  
 Information on exports and imports is important to the study of international business 
for a number of reasons. First, trade is the historical basis of international business and 
trade activities help us understand MNE practices and strategies. In 2008 the world’s largest 
importers were the United States, China, and Germany (see the Appendix,  Table   1A   ). The 
world’s largest exporters were China, Germany, and the United States (see the Appendix, 
 Table   1B   ). Note that the world’s top importers are also the world’s largest exporters but in 
a different order. Some of the major products that are traded by these countries include 
computers, farm machinery, machine tools, automobiles, and electronic goods.  
 Second, trade helps us better understand the impact of international business on world 
economies. For example, Japan imports all of its oil. So when the price of oil in the world 
market rises sharply, we can readily predict that the cost of manufacturing cars in Japan 
will rise and Japanese auto exports will decline. Conversely, if oil prices decline, we can 
predict that world imports of Japanese cars are likely to increase. 
 A third reason why exports and imports are important in the study of international 
business is that they are the main drivers of international trade (FDI is another driver, 
which we discuss below and then in detail in  Chapter 3 ). When worldwide exports and 
imports begin to slow down, this is a very good sign that world economies are going into 
a slump. 
 The US trade ties to Canada and Mexico reflect the triad effect, as these three countries 
are members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Indeed, more than 
57 percent of the exports of the United States, Canada, and Mexico are intra-regional, 
that is, to each other. 4  A similar picture of regional trade concentrations appears in the 
EU, where over 67 percent of all the exports of the EU 15 member states are with each 
other. 5  Similarly, over 54 percent of Asian exports are to other Asian countries.       6  Table  1.2

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
reports that the majority of exports of these triad areas now occurs within each region and 
that this intra-regional trade has increased significantly since 1980. The recent decrease 
in intra-regional trade in the Asian region is partly due to the emergence of China as a 
manufacturer for the US market.   
 Foreign direct investment 
 Foreign direct investment (FDI)   is equity funds invested in other nations. It is different 
from portfolio (ﬁ nancial) investment in that FDI is undertaken by MNEs which exercise 
control of their foreign afﬁ liates. Like exports and imports, FDI is a driver of international 
business and many companies use FDI to establish footholds in the world marketplace by 
setting up operations in foreign markets or by acquiring businesses there. Firms engage in 
FDI for a number of reasons: to increase sales and proﬁ ts, to enter rapidly growing markets, 
to reduce costs, to gain a foothold in economic unions, to protect domestic markets, to 
protect foreign markets, and to acquire technological and managerial know-how. These will 
be discussed in more detail in  Chapter 3 .  
 When examined from an overall perspective, FDI data show that industrialized 
 countries have invested very large amounts of money in other industrialized nations 
as well as smaller amounts in less developed countries (LDCs) such as those in Eastern 
Europe or newly industrialized countries (NICs) such as Korea and Singapore. However, 
most of the world’s FDI is invested both by and within the three broad triad groups we 
identified earlier: NAFTA, EU 15, and Asia. The United States is an excellent example of a 
country that is a major target of investment as well as a major investor in other countries. 
Its high GDP per capita and consumer spending make it an attractive market for foreign 
multinationals. Conversely, US firms have specialized capabilities that can be exploited 
in other countries. 
 By 2008 the United States had become such a major investment target that foreign hold-
ings were over $2.3 trillion. (See  Table   1.3a    on stocks of FDI in the United States.) The 
largest investors are the UK, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and 
France. Collectively these countries account for over two-thirds of the stock of all FDI in 
the United States. Note that the Chinese stock of FDI in the United States is still so small 
that it does not make the list. At the same time, as seen in  Table   1.3b   , US companies have 
substantial FDI in other countries which amounts to more than $3.2 trillion. The major 
areas for this FDI are the Netherlands, the UK, Canada, Bermuda, and Luxembourg. Note 
that the US FDI stock in China is now on this list, but still only 1.45 percent of the total. 
Using FDI flow data the amount of Chinese FDI in the United States is much higher, but

this is not reflected in the stock FDI data as it is much newer than the US FDI in Europe 
and Japan, where this grows through retained earnings. 
 A close look at  Tables   1.3a    and  Table   1.3b    shows that the UK and Japan have larger FDI 
stocks in the United States than the United States has FDI stock in the UK and Japan. The 
United States has larger FDI stocks in Europe than Europe has FDI stocks in the United 
States. On the other hand, US businesses have more FDI in Latin America and the Western 
hemisphere relative to the Europeans or Japanese. US companies have put much more FDI 
into Australia than Australia has FDI in the United States.     
 These recent data reveal two important trends. First, the United States is a prime site 
for FDI by both Japan and countries in Western Europe. Second, US firms have invested 
most heavily in Canada, Europe, Latin America, and other Western hemisphere areas, and 
Asia–Pacific. These four areas account for over 97.8 percent of the stock of all US FDI. 
(For more on FDI see the Appendix, Tables 1C and 1D, at the end of this chapter. We also 
discuss FDI and the role of MNEs in more detail in  Chapter 2 .)

Why did Coke engage in foreign direct investments in Europe? 
 Coke made these investments in order to improve its market position. This is being done in 
three ways. First, the construction of new bottling plants is helping the company produce 
a low-cost product. Second, marketing expenditures are helping the firm gain the product 
recognition needed for growth. Third, direct investments in facilities closer to the market 
are reducing delivery time and eliminating associated expenses.

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
 The triad 
 As we noted above, companies in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan conduct 
most of the world’s trade and FDI. Of these companies, those located in Western Europe 
mainly come from nations that are members of the EU. The core   triad   is a group of three 
major trading and investment blocs in the international arena: the United States, the EU, 
and Japan. Before looking more closely at the impact of the triad on international business, 
it is important to discuss the countries that are members of this group.   
 The first of these, the  United States , has the largest economy in the world with a GDP 
of over $14.14 trillion (2009 estimate)! 7  Sometimes when the United States is discussed 
as a member of the triad, Canada and Mexico are included. This is because these three 
countries implemented the   North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)   in 1994, an 
international covenant that has resulted in the elimination of many trade and investment 
barriers between the three. We further discuss NAFTA in  Chapter 19 . In our discussions 
of the triad in the book, we will be talking only about the United States; if we intend 
to include Canada and Mexico we will indicate so by referring to them as members of 
NAFTA. The reason that our triad discussions will include only the United States is that the 
US economy is extremely large when compared to those of Canada and Mexico. As a result, 
if we were to talk about the 25 largest MNEs in NAFTA we would be discussing US firms 
only. Canadian or Mexican firms are not big enough to make this list of 25. Simply put, 
the US economy is so large that this one country constitutes an entire segment of the triad.  
 The second segment of the triad is the  European Union . This group of nations, whose 
history and current developments will be discussed in  Chapters 3  and  17 , was formed by 
six countries in the late 1950s. Today there are 27 members of the EU. This includes the 
EU15—Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the UK—an additional 8 
East European countries that joined on May 1, 2004—Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and Slovakia—as well as Cyprus and Malta. 
Bulgaria and Romania became members of the EU in 2007 (see map, European Union 
timeline) while Turkey continues to negotiate its entry into the union. In this book, unless 
noted otherwise, data are for the EU15. These are the largest countries in the group, 
accounting for 90 percent of the GDP of the EU. Statistical information on the EU27 is 
not yet generally available. The collective GDP of the EU is greater than that of the United 
States or Japan, and a brief look at some of the economic data in this chapter helps show 
how important the EU is in the international arena. For example, in terms of imports and 
exports, as seen back in  Table   1.1   , the EU accounts for more than 35 percent of all imports 
and over 38.4 percent of all world exports. Again, over 60 percent is intra-EU trade. Quite 
clearly, the EU is a worldwide economic force.   
 The third group in the core triad is  Japan , which like the other two members plays a 
major role in international business. This is made particularly clear by looking at areas 
such as importing, exporting, and FDI. As seen in the Appendix, Tables 1A and 1B, at the 
end of the chapter, Japan is the world’s fourth largest importer and fourth largest exporter. 
At market prices it is the largest economy in Asia and it has by far the highest GDP per 
capita. Japan accounts for 5 percent of all the world’s imports and 4.3 percent of all of the 
world’s exports. Japan also accounts for 4.2 percent of all outward stocks of FDI. (See the 
Appendix, Table 1D.) 
 In examining the current state of world business, the core triad merits close attention. 
Every year companies from these three groups account for more trade and FDI than those 
of any other economic bloc. As a result, during the twenty-first century the triad will be of 
central importance in the study of international business. We will discuss the power of the 
core triad in greater detail in  Chapter 3 .

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Although the triad dominates international business, as discussed in this book, over the 
past few years a number of emerging economies have become increasingly important for 
international business. In particular, Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) are growing 
players in international trade and FDI. These countries will be explored further in  Chapters 20  
and  21 , which deal with non-triad economies. ( Chapter 21 deals entirely with China.)   
 
 Although the triad continues to dominate the international business arena, the inter-
national environment has been changing rapidly in recent years. Today the world economy 
is quite different from what it was just ﬁ ve years ago. Some of the reasons include an overall 
slowdown in the triad economies, the introduction of more local and international trade

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
regulation, the impact of technology, and the rise of small and medium-sized multinationals. 
The following brieﬂ y examines each of these. 
 Economic developments are detailed by the   Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD)  , a Paris-based intergovernmental organization of the world’s 
most economically advanced nations that provides its members with a forum for examin-
ing their economic problems and discussing solutions.  
 International trade regulation 
 Another important international business trend has been the emergence of trade and 
investment liberalization. Firms in triad countries have prospered in more open markets. 
Yet, at the same time, triad rivalry has led to some setbacks in trade liberalization. For 
example, Japan and China have been threatened with trade sanctions by the United States 
unless they allow US ﬁ rms to sell products and services in their countries. There are also 
trade conﬂ icts between the EU and the United States over biotech foods and crops, steel, 
beef hormones, and export subsidies. 8 Many such trade disputes, however, are handled not 
by countries but by international organizations set up to regulate international commerce. 
The main one is the World Trade Organization. 
 The  World Trade Organization (WTO)   was established on January 1, 1995, and it is 
now the umbrella organization that governs the international trading system. It is the 
successor to the   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  . The GATT was 
established in 1947. The purpose of the GATT was to liberalize trade and to negotiate 
trade concessions among member countries. Although the early years saw a great deal of 
progress in reducing tariffs, by the 1980s there was a trend toward protectionism by many 
countries. At the GATT’s eighth round of negotiations in 1986 (called the Uruguay Round 
because this is where the group met), negotiations dragged on for years before culminat-
ing in a number of agreements including reductions on industrial goods and agricultural 
subsidies, the increased protection of intellectual property rights under the Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the creation of the General 
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and the creation of the WTO to implement the 
GATT agreement. Today the WTO is enforcing these agreements. Presently, the Doha 
Round of the WTO has opened the door for further trade negotiations.     
 When member nations have a dispute they can turn to the WTO to help resolve it. For 
example, the United States brought a case against the EU charging it with a discriminatory 
banana import policy and the WTO ruled in its favor. In another case the United States 
requested that Japan be instructed to reorganize its commercial economy so that Kodak could 
better compete in that market against Fuji, its major rival, but the WTO rejected the claim 
and ruled in Japan’s favor. In recent years the United States, the EU, and Japan, in particular, 
have been using the WTO to help resolve trade disputes, and this bodes well for the future of 
the organization. The important thing to remember about the WTO is that it can enforce its 
decisions. Countries that refuse to comply can find themselves suffering severe consequences 
in the form of trade retaliation. Despite minor conflicts, international trade liberalization has 
arrived and this promises to help stimulate international business transactions.  
 Technology 
 Another major development that is changing the way MNEs do business is technology. Two 
areas, in particular, are having a major impact. One is communication technology that has 
advanced at such a rapid rate that all businesses now use computers and rely on the World 
Wide Web to both access and send information. In addition, thanks to cellular technol-
ogy, individuals can now remain in constant contact with both their customers and their 
home ofﬁ ce. Communication technology has advanced so much that the latest technology

 Amazon.com is not a global business 
 There are thousands of “global” businesses on the internet. 
However, the best known of these may well be Amazon.com. 
Everyday, thousands of people go to the company’s website 
to browse and purchase books. A novel that is reviewed 
by Sunday in  New York Times Book Review  is likely to get a 
minimum of 10,000 hits within the next week, as readers 
read the comments of others, and check for price and 
availability. For example, the  Times Book Review  gave a 
good review to  Nickel and Dimed , a book which had to that 
date generated lukewarm sales and for which its publisher 
had little hope, thousands went to Amazon.com to place 
an order and within a few hours the current inventory was 
exhausted. The incident shows the impact of not only the 
 Times Book Review but also Amazon.com. The first created 
the demand while the second facilitated the distribution. 
 Amazon.com was founded in 1995 by Jeff Bezos. In less 
than 10 years the company became one of the largest 
1,000 US corporations according to Fortune. In 2009, sales 
were $24,509 million. On the other hand, Amazon.com has 
consistently lost money. In 2000, every dollar sales the 
company took in, it lost 51 cents. Losses continued through 
to 2003, when a small profit was first reported.  
 Amazon was initially created to change the way people 
buy books. The company wanted to offer buyers a virtual 
store where they could use their computer to place an 
order that would then be delivered to them by mail. Going to 
a bookstore was going to be a thing of the past. In addition 
to making it easy to buy books, Amazon’s prices were lower 
than those at most bookstores – even when shipping costs 
were added in, it was often less expensive to shop online 
with Amazon than it was to visit the local bookstore. 
 From the beginning, Bezos’s strategy was to grow as 
fast as possible. He began recruiting highly skilled staff 
to design the e-commerce end of the business, as well as 
less skilled workers to handle warehouse, distribution, 
and supply operations. Initially, all of the employees had a 
common vision regarding what the company wanted to do. 
However, in a few short years, this rapid growth resulted in 
both confusion and internal problems. Among other things, 
some of the personnel filed lawsuits against the company 
for better compensation. Continued losses and the dot.com 
crash of 2000 severely reduced the price of its stock. 
 Today the biggest problem for Amazon.com is that it 
is not a global company – it is a US firm. The Internet is 
really only a tool for business and, in Amazon’s case, a 
way to sell products that are produced by others. While 
the company now sells more than just books, it continues 
to be a US company. One reason is because books tend to 
sell most heavily in the market where they are published. 
A college text published in North America, for example, 
will not sell very much in Europe or Japan. Quite simply, 
triad and geographic regions segment the market—and 
even within this grouping, it can be difficult to sell to 
other countries. For example, in 2009, Amazon generated 
53.3 percent of its sales in North America and 47.7 percent 
internationally. But even in Canada, the firm continually 
confronts a number of problems doing business includ-
ing how to address Canadian sales taxes and how to 
deal with the threat by Canadian publishers of having the 
state-run postal service refuse to deliver “foreign” books. 
In fact, these problems have created such a headache for 
Canadian buyers that many of them now order their online 
books from Canadian suppliers such as Chapters and 
Borders rather than from Amazon. And in Europe, where 
Amazon operates through foreign subsidiaries, such as 
Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr, and Amazon.de, the company 
offers a totally different stock of books from those mar-
keted in North America, and it targets a smaller, more 
affluent group of customers in this niche. The same mar-
keting strategy is used in Asia. On both of these continents, 
customers are finding that local book suppliers often do 
a better job of meeting their needs in terms of both the 
range of their offerings and the price of their products. In 
short, Amazon.com is finding that if it wants to be a global 
competitor it is going to have to formulate a strategy that 
helps it expand out of the US market and become much 
more competitive throughout the triad. At the present time, 
Amazon.com is only half of the way there.

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
 The other major application of technology is for the production of goods and services. 
Modern factories can now produce goods in a shorter period of time and with fewer 
defects thanks to production process programs. One example is the introduction of “Six 
Sigma”— a statistical term that means 3.4 errors per million—that eliminates performance 
problems in the production process and encourages worker participation and innovation 
to create products that meet the needs and wants of consumers.       11  Since Motorola engineers 
introduced the concept into their production process in the 1980s, hundreds of MNEs, 
including GE, Coca-Cola, and Boeing, have adopted the process, reducing defects, lower-
ing costs, and improving quality. 12  (See  Chapter 12  for a discussion of Six Sigma and other 
production process programs.) 
  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
 Whenever MNEs are discussed, it is common to hear about large ﬁ rms. In fact, the best-
known multinationals are companies that have become household words. In the auto 
industry everyone knows of Honda, General Motors, and Volkswagen. However, there are 
thousands of   small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  , many of whom are  suppliers 
to these MNEs. 13  Most of these companies have annual sales of less than $5 million, but 
thanks to innovation, technology, and a well-trained workforce, they are able to compete 
effectively and perform functions that multinationals cannot do as efﬁ ciently. For exam-
ple, some SMEs are able to provide their customers with two-day deliveries. In this way, 
their customers can keep a minimum amount of inventory on hand because the suppliers 
will replenish the stock every other day. And since these SMEs are small operations that 
focus heavily on cost control and quality, they are critical to the success of their customers. 
The result is that SMEs are proving to be the backbone of many industries because of their 
 efﬁ ciency and ﬂ exibility. In addition, a number of SMEs compete effectively against large 
companies in niche markets. In this book we will be studying a large number of inter-
national business concepts that are used not just by MNEs but also by SMEs. In particular, 
we discuss the strategies of some SMEs in cases like Command Alkon in  Chapter 9  and 
Mountain Equipment Co-op in  Chapter 8 .   
 SMEs or small-
and-medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs)

using different criteria for 
policy purposes. SMEs 
are firms with less than 
250 employees in Europe, 
but less than 500 in the 
United States. Indian 
manufacturing firms qualify 
as SMEs if they invest less 
than US$2 million in plant 
and equipment. 
 At the end of each chapter in this book we use Real Cases to illustrate some of the ways 
MNEs use the ideas that have been presented. In this opening chapter we introduced the 
world of international business and showed the impact of the triad on international trade 
and investment. We also noted that the major world economies are beginning to slow down 
and this, of course, is putting increased pressure on MNEs to maintain growth and proﬁ t-
ability. In this section we want to address three areas that are important in understanding 
how companies are coping with this international environment. First, we are going to look 
at some of the misconceptions that people have about MNEs and how they formulate their 
international strategies. Second, we are going to look at some of the criteria that are impor-
tant to MNEs in achieving strategic competitive advantage. Third, we are going to examine 
some examples of MNEs that are using concepts that we have introduced in this chapter. 
 Regional triad strategies 
 There are a number of misconceptions that people have about the world of international 
business, and it is important to dispel these at the very start of this book. One is the belief 
that multinationals have far-ﬂ ung operations and earn most of their revenues overseas. 
 GLOBALIZATION AND STRATEGIC 
MANAGEMENT 

18
PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
Nestlé is often cited as an example. This company sells over 8,500 products in more than 
100 countries and earns more than 65 percent of its revenues outside of Switzerland.       14 
Although this is true, Nestlé is an exception to the rule. Most MNEs earn the bulk of their 
revenues either within their home country or by selling in nearby locales. In fact, recent 
research reports that: 
  More than 85 percent of all automobiles sold in North America are built in North American 
factories owned by General Motors, Ford, Daimler, Chrysler, or European or Japanese MNEs; 
over 90 percent of the cars produced in the EU are sold there; and more than 93 percent of all 
cars registered in Japan are manufactured domestically. 
 In the specialty chemicals sector over 90 percent of all paint is made and used regionally 
by triad based MNEs and the same is true for steel, heavy electrical equipment, energy, and 
transportation. 
 In the services sector, which now employs approximately 70 percent of the work force in North 
America, Western Europe, and Japan, these activities are all essentially local or regional.       15 
 To be successful, MNEs need to create strategies that are regional, not worldwide, in 
focus and they need to be responsive to local consumers as opposed to being global in 
nature and uniform throughout. 
 Another misunderstanding about MNEs is the belief that they are globally monolithic 
and excessively powerful in political terms. Actually, the latest research shows that, of the 
500 largest MNEs, well over 400 are headquartered in North America, the EU, and in Japan/
Asia. We discuss this further in  Chapter 2 ,  Table   2.1   . In short, these firms are not spread out 
around the world but are clustered in the triad. This relatively even distribution across the 
three regions of the triad implies not a dominant MNE culture but the interaction of differ-
ent cultures in the international business arena. Recent research has also shown that the vast 
majority of MNEs have not been able to spread their marketing operations evenly across 
the world but depend on their own regions of the triad for over half of their revenue.       16 
These companies are engaged not in global competition but in triad/regional competition, 
and this rivalry is so strong that it has effectively eliminated the possibility of their either 
achieving sustainable long-term profits or building strong, enduring political advantage. In 
fact, it is now common to find MNEs joining forces with local firms which can help them 
in their efforts to penetrate local markets. In recent years the  strategic alliance , a busi-
ness relationship in which two or more companies work together to achieve a collective 
advantage, has become extremely popular with MNEs which now realize that they need to 
develop strategies with a regional or local focus if they hope to succeed.   
 A third misunderstanding is the belief that MNEs develop homogeneous products for 
the world market and through their efficient production techniques are able to dominate 
local markets everywhere. In fact, multinationals have to adapt their products for the local 
market. For example, there is no worldwide, global car. Rather, there are regionally based 
auto factories that are supported by local and regional suppliers which provide steel, plastic, 
paint, seats, tires, radios, and other necessary inputs for producing cars for that geographic 
region. Additionally, the car designs that are popular in one area of the world are typically 
rejected by buyers in other geographic areas. The Toyota Camry that dominates the US 
auto market is a poor seller in Japan and fares even worse in Europe.       17  And the Volkswagen 
Golf, which does extremely well in Europe, has not made much of an impact in North 
America. Pharmaceutical firms, which manufacture medicines that are often referred to as 
“universal products,” have to modify their goods to satisfy national and state regulations, 
thus making centralized production and worldwide distribution economically difficult. 18  
 In this book we are going to use examples throughout of what is happening in the inter-
national environment and show how an understanding of international business concepts 
can be useful to companies in addressing these developments. In many cases you will find 
that things you believed to be true are not. There is a great deal of misinformation about

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
the world of international business. One of these misperceptions is that MNEs are giant 
corporations that are world dominant. In fact, their success comes most heavily from for-
mulating and implementing strategies on a regional and local basis. 
 Maintaining economic competitiveness 
 The United States is one of the most competitive nations in the world.       19  How do US com-
panies manage to achieve and then maintain this international competitive advantage? 
Another way of asking this question is: why are some ﬁ rms able to innovate consistently 
while others cannot? Michael Porter of Harvard University has provided one of the best 
answers to this question. After conducting a comprehensive study of 100 industries in 
10 countries, Porter found that the success of nations in international competition is 
determined by four broad attributes that individually and interactively determine national 
competitive advantage: factor conditions, demand conditions, related and supporting 
industries, and the environment in which ﬁ rms compete. 20  These four determinants are 
brieﬂ y discussed below. This “diamond” model of Porter can be applied not only to US 
ﬁ rms but to ﬁ rms from any country. 
 Factor conditions 
 According to basic international trade theory, a nation will export those goods that make 
most use of the factor conditions with which it is relatively well endowed. These   factor 
conditions include land, labor, and capital. As a result, if a country has a large, relatively 
uneducated workforce, it will seek to export goods that are highly labor intensive. On the 
other hand, if the workforce is highly educated, the country will seek to produce goods 
and services that tap the intellectual abilities of these people. However, there is more to 
international trade theory than merely capitalizing on these basic factors. To maintain a 
competitive position, a country must continually upgrade or adjust its factor conditions. 
For example, Denmark has two hospitals that specialize in studying and treating diabetes; 
Denmark also is a world leader in the export of insulin. By creating specialized factors and 
then working to upgrade them, the country has maintained its premier position in the 
health-care ﬁ eld. Similarly, the Netherlands, the world’s leading exporter of ﬂ owers, has cre-
ated research institutes in the cultivation, packaging, and shipping of ﬂ owers. As a result, no 
one has been able to dislodge that country’s foothold in the international ﬂ ower industry.

How did Coke improve its factor conditions in Europe? 
 Coke’s factor conditions include land, labor, and capital. The company is using land and capital 
to build new bottling plants that are more efficient and better suited to meet market demand. 
It is working to improve the effectiveness of the labor force by getting the personnel to become 
more market oriented and to sell the product more vigorously throughout Europe.  
 Demand conditions 
 Porter states that a nation’s competitive advantage is strengthened if there is strong local 
demand for its goods and services. This demand provides a number of beneﬁ ts. First, it 
helps the seller understand what buyers want. Second, if changes become necessary, such as 
customer desires for a product that is smaller, lighter, or more fuel efﬁ cient, the local seller 

20
PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
has early warning and can adjust or innovate for the market before more distant competi-
tors can respond. In fact, the more sophisticated the local buyers, the greater the advan-
tage to the local seller. For example, one reason that Japanese ﬁ rms pioneered small, quiet 
air-conditioning units is that many Japanese live in small houses and apartments where 
loud noise can be a problem. Japanese ﬁ rms also developed units that were powered by 
energy-saving rotary compressors because customers complained that the price of energy 
was very high and they wanted a more fuel-efﬁ cient unit. Similarly, Sweden, long concerned 
with helping the disabled, has spawned a competitive industry that focuses on the special 
needs of these people, and Denmark’s environmental concern has resulted in Danish com-
panies developing highly effective water-pollution control equipment and windmills. In 
the United States, consumers helped to develop a highly efﬁ cient fast-food industry, and as 
the desire for this cuisine spread worldwide, US franchisors like McDonald’s and Pizza Hut 
have been able to tap international demand for their products. 
  Related and supporting industries 
 Porter’s third major determinant of national competitive advantage is the presence of related 
and supporting industries that are internationally competitive. When suppliers are located 
near the producer, these ﬁ rms often provide lower-cost inputs that are not available to the 
producer’s distant competitors. In addition, suppliers typically know what is happening in 
the industry environment and are in a position to both forecast and react to these changes. 
By sharing this information with the producer, they help the producer maintain its com-
petitive position. The Italian shoe industry is an excellent example. Shoe producers interact 
on a regular basis with leather manufacturers, exchanging information that is useful to each 
in remaining competitive. This interaction is mutually beneﬁ cial to both parties.       21   
  Firm strategy, structure, and rivalry 
 Porter’s fourth broad determinant of national advantage is the context in which the ﬁ rms 
are created, organized, and managed, as well as the nature of domestic rivalry. No one man-
agerial system is universally appropriate. Nations tend to do well in industries where the 
management practices favored by the national environment are suited to their industries’ 
sources of competitive advantage. In Italy, for example, successful ﬁ rms typically are small 
or medium sized; operate in fragmented industries such as lighting, furniture, footwear, 
and packaging machines; are managed like extended families; and employ a focus strategy 
geared toward meeting the needs of small market niches. Germany, in contrast, tends to 
have hierarchical organizations that emphasize technical or engineering content (optics, 
chemicals, complicated machinery) that demand precision manufacturing, a careful devel-
opment process, after-sale service, and a highly disciplined management structure. In 
Japan, successful ﬁ rms are often those that require unusual cooperation across functional 
lines and that demand management of complex assembly operations. Auto production, 
 television manufacturing, and computer assembly are examples of such industries. 
 National goals are also important. Some countries want rapid results. Others tend to 
do best in industries where long-term development is valued more. In the United States, 
for example, investors like fast financial returns. So US firms are more likely to invest in 
new industries such as software and biotechnology where success can come quickly. In 
Germany and Switzerland, investments are held for long-term appreciation and are rarely 
traded. These countries are more likely to invest in mature industries where ongoing 
investment in research and development and new facilities are important but return on 
investment is only moderate. 
 Another area of importance is domestic rivalry. Researchers have found that vigorous 
domestic rivalry and competitive advantage are related. Nations with leading world positions 
often have a number of strong, local rivals. For example, in Switzerland, the pharmaceutical 

21
CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
firms Roche and Novartis help the country to maintain its internationally competitive edge. 
In Germany, BASF and Bayer help the country to keep ahead in chemicals.

How is local rivalry helping to improve Coke’s competitive advantage? 
 Coke faces strong competition in Europe. Europeans do not drink as much Coke as do 
Americans; beverages such as coffee and tea are more popular. As a result, Coke has had to 
modify its strategy to address this market. This includes the building of new bottling plants 
that can help drive down costs and make the company more price competitive, and new mar-
keting campaigns that are designed to draw customers away from competing products. Coke 
is also working to develop non-carbonated drinks to address local tastes. Finally, competition 
from locals who better understand their market is forcing Coke to “think local, act local.”  
✔
  Porter’s determinants as a system 
 As noted earlier, each of Porter’s determinants of international competitiveness often 
depends on the others. For example, even if a country has sophisticated buyers that can 
provide a company with feedback about how to modify or improve its product (demand 
conditions), this information will not be useful if the ﬁ rm lacks personnel with the skills to 
carry out these functions (factor conditions). Similarly, if suppliers can provide the com-
pany with low-cost inputs and fresh ideas for innovation (related and supporting indus-
tries) but the ﬁ rm clearly and easily dominates the industry (ﬁ rm strategy, structure, and 
rivalry) and does not feel a need to upgrade the quality of its products and services, it will 
eventually lose this competitive advantage. 
 Research shows that of Porter’s determinants of competitiveness, domestic rivalry/
geographic clustering is particularly important. Domestic rivalry promotes improvements 
in the other three determinants and geographic concentration magnifies the interaction of 
the four separate influences. 22 
 A firm’s international abilities and competitiveness can also be described through a com-
bination of firm-specific advantages (FSAs) and country-specific advantages (CSAs). This 
theoretical framework is developed in  Chapter 2 . The Porter country diamond framework, 
discussed in this section, is an excellent framework to capture the CSAs. In  Chapter 2 , we 
will start to discuss the FSAs of the MNE. The CSAs and FSAs can then be combined into the 
matrix of  Chapter 2 . This becomes the building block for the book. For example, the CSAs 
will be explored in more detail in Part Two of the book ( Chapters 4 ,  5 ,  6 , and  7 ), which deal 
respectively with political, cultural, trade, and financial issues. These are all issues affecting 
the environment of international business. Then, Part Three of the book looks into inter-
national business strategies. These includes MNE strategy, organizing strategy, corporate 
strategy and national responsiveness, and innovation, entrepreneurship and born global firms. 
Part Five provides insights of regional strategies. These includes European Union, Japan, 
North America, Emerging economies, China and corporate ethics and natural environment.  
 Multinationals in action 
 In each chapter of this book we are going to provide examples of how MNEs are using 
the ideas that we have been presenting. Usually we do this by highlighting a relevant case 
example, as in the box  International Business Strategy in Action: Tata . In this ﬁ rst chapter we 

22
PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Tata 
 One of India’s largest multinational enterprises is Tata 
Group. In 2009, the total revenues for Tata Group are US 
$70.9 billion. The majority of its sales are still in Asia. Tata 
Group is one of the world’s largest emerging economy 
MNEs. Its financial clout was shown when it purchased 
Corus in 2007, beating off a competing bid from a Brazilian 
company, Cia Siderurgica National.   
 Tata has about 100 different operating companies in all 
three regions of the triad, but still mainly in Asia. There 
are no data on its regional sales. Its major enterprises are: 
Tata Steel; Tata Consulting Services; Tata Motors; and Tata 
Tea. It employs over 250,000 people. 
 Its foreign holdings include the UK’s largest steel com-
pany, Corus Group, which it bought in February 2007 for 
$12.2 billion. Its first foreign purchase was of the former 
stalwart of the British Empire, Tetley Tea, which it bought 
in 2000. Tata Group also own Eight O’Clock Coffee Co. 
of the United States which it bought in 2006 and Daewoo 
Commercial Vehicle Co. of South Korea which it bought in 
2004. In September 2007 it was announced that Tata Motors 
Limited (part of the Tata Group) was going to buy up Jaguar 
and Land Rover from Ford Motor Company at a price of 
over $2 billion. Why has Tata become so successful? 
 Tata’s history is tightly intertwined with the history of 
India. Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata founded a trading com-
pany in 1868, when India was still under British control, 
and soon entered the textiles market. It then forayed into 
the hotels business with the construction, in Mumbai, of the 
Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, the first Indian-owned luxury 
hotel. The story surrounding this event is that the owner 
of Tata was not allowed into British hotels because he was 
Indian and so now the international hotel chain has become 
a symbol of national pride. Today, Tata’s influence can be 
seen throughout the Indian economy. Near the hotel you 
can see a Tata Power Plant that generates about 80 percent 
of the power in India’s largest city. The urban landscape is 
filled with Tata cars, buses, and trucks as well as billboards 
advertising everything from Tata Tea to Tata credit cards.  
 The recent growth of this vast conglomerate is the result 
of two important events, deregulation and the appoint-
ment of Ratan Tata as chairman of the company. In 1991, 
the Indian government began to dismantle many of the 
bureaucratic impediments that had constrained Indian 
businesses. The same year, Ratan Tata took control of his 
family’s company and began to rationalize the group by 
divesting itself of hundreds of companies. He kept about a 
hundred companies in key sectors and began to implement 
a series of strategic plans, including internationalization. 
Since 2000, Tata has purchased Tetley Tea (of the UK), 
30 percent of Glaceu (a US manufacturer of bottled water), 
and Eight O’Clock Coffee (a US firm), all these in the bever-
ages sector alone. Foreign acquisitions have also been part 
of the strategic plan of Tata Steel and Tata Motors. 
 Over the past few years, the steel industry has been 
consolidating through acquisitions. One example of this 
is Mittal Steel’s purchase of Arcelor in 2007. Run by an 
India-born UK entrepreneur, the new company had shown 
interest in setting up integrated iron and steel plants in 
India. Tata Steel is considered the lowest-cost producer 
in the world but it felt threatened by such industry-wide 
consolidation. Mittal–Arcelor production capacity is much 
higher than Tata Steel’s and its entry into the Indian mar-
ket could reduce its costs, thus eroding Tata Steel’s com-
petitive advantage. For years, Tata Steel has been growing 
its capacity through acquisitions. In 2004 it purchased 
Singapore’s NatSteel and the following year Thailand’s 
Millennium Steel. Its biggest acquisition, however, came 
at the heels of Mittal’s acquisition of Arcelor. In 2007 Tata 
Steel beat a Brazilian company to purchase Corus, an 
Anglo-Dutch steel maker that was much larger than itself. 
The price was $12 billion, the largest outward foreign 
acquisition by an Indian firm. Together, the new company 
is the world’s fifth-largest steel producer, though, notably, 
it is still smaller than Mittal–Arcelor.

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
 In the automotive sector, Tata chose not to partner up 
with a foreign company to produce passenger cars. The 
company’s strategy is to create a cheap, functional car for 
the large untapped markets of developing nations and use 
that as a stepping stone for markets in developed countries. 
In 1988, Tata Motors launched the Indica, and in 2005 
the car was retailing at $7,000. Not cheap enough. The 
company then developed the Ace, a small car that turned 
profitable rather quickly, covering its developing costs 
within a year of its release. The car cannot be exported to 
developed countries because of safety and emission regu-
lations. If all goes well Tata Motors will start production of 
a $3,000 car. However, it is not going at it alone. In 2004 it 
purchased Daewoo’s Commercial Vehicles of South Korea 
and in 2008 it bought up Jaguar and Rover from Ford Motor 
for a price of about $2.3 billion. This will infuse the com-
pany with the knowledge, technology, and capacity to carve 
itself a new and more upmarket niche in the automobile 
world market.  
 Tata companies might have the highest profile, but they 
are hardly the only ambitious Indian companies expand-
ing overseas. In the first three quarters for 2006, Indian 
companies made 115 foreign acquisitions for a total value 
of $7.4 billion. Almost as many as foreign companies 
have invested in Indian companies. Over the past few 
years, Wipro, an IT company, has purchased companies 
in Portugal, Finland, and California. Ranbaxy, a maker or 
generic drugs, purchased Etimed of Belgium and Munogen 
of Spain, the generics arm of GlaxoSmithKline. This foreign 
expansion is being driven by strong balance sheets due to 
a domestic boom in India, the availability of credit, and a 
capable and ambitious group of entrepreneurs with a new-
found confidence.  
 In summary, with total group revenue of $70.9 billion and 
about 100 companies, the Tata Group is the largest publicly 
traded company in India. Highly diversified, the conglomer-
ate produces steel, cars, tea, and chemicals, and provides a 
series of services, including hotels, consulting, and telecom-
munications. Most of its operations are in its home market of 
India, where it derives about two-thirds of its total revenues, 
but it has recently aggressively increased its international 
presence to access the triad markets of Europe and North 
America, in addition to its presence in Asia.

petitive advantage. Here are an additional three examples of how multinationals are using 
some of these ideas in their operations. 
 Volkswagen 
 Volkswagen (VW) is well known in the auto market, although like most MNEs it does much 
better in its regional market (Europe, where it has 71.41 percent of its sales in 2009) than it 
does in other areas of the triad. North America, VW’s second-largest market, accounts for 
just 10.83 percent of total sales. The company’s VW and Audi brand groups collectively hold 
18.2 percent of the West European new passenger car market and 4.8 percent of the US mar-
ket. In the past decade VW’s market share in both Europe and America has increased because 
the company has been doing a number of things well. One is the use of innovative design. 
The top-selling VW brands in the United States, for example, all have innovative features, 
such that dashboard instruments such as the speedometer and clock light up in red at night, 
while those items that the driver touches, such as the radio, are backlit in blue. Commenting 
on these design features, one auto researcher remarked, “It gives the vehicle some soul, which 
many of VW’s competitors lack horribly.” 23  A second factor accounting for VW’s success is its 
commitment to using the most efﬁ cient technology in building its cars. Its Wolfsburg plant 
in Germany is one of the most innovative in the world. It has the largest state-of-the-art 
paint shop in Europe, which uses eco-friendly, water-based paints. A combination of human 
skill and automation allows VW to design each car to each customer’s speciﬁ cations. Yet VW 
is not counting on its present achievements in design and production processes to maintain 
its competitive advantage. It must continuously update these to keep at the top of its game.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Carrefour 
 Carrefour is the world’s second-largest retailer (behind Wal-Mart) and the largest in terms 
of number of stores and geographic coverage. In 2009, Carrefour had 69 percent of its sales 
in Europe but it had almost 15,594 stores spread throughout 29 countries on four conti-
nents. What makes the company particularly successful is its ability to create a local strat-
egy for each of its units. Carrefour has a knack for designing its stores to meet local tastes. 
At least 90 percent of the goods that it sells in a store cater to the local market because the 
company believes that each unit should reﬂ ect the image of that country. 24  “You have to 
adapt your food and other products to the local culture,” notes the company’s chairman and 
chief executive ofﬁ cer; and this is done in a wide variety of ways. 25 For example, in Catholic 
Poland, the latest Carrefour hypermarket has a special religion section featuring Bibles, 
candles, and primers for children who are preparing for their ﬁ rst communion. In China, 
where many shoppers are superstitious, the company takes care to ensure that vegetables 
are chopped vertically—not laterally—so as not to bring bad luck to shoppers. And to make 
sure that it does not stumble badly by getting into countries where it truly does not know 
how to do business effectively, the company never sets up operations until it has researched 
the local market for at least one year so that it familiarizes itself with the customs of doing 
business there. As a result, while Wal-Mart has had a wide variety of operating problems in 
markets such as China, Thailand, and Brazil, Carrefour’s efforts in these countries have all 
worked out well. 
 Kawasaki and Suzuki 
 Competition in the international motorcycle marketplace today is greater than ever. 
Japan is a good example. In this market where Honda and Yamaha are the leaders and 
Kawasaki and Suzuki are the next largest competitors, the four ﬁ rms have consistently 
led the world market with their technologically innovative sports bikes. The problem for 
all four, however, is that the high cost of R&D has resulted in very high prices for their 
bikes. And to make matters worse, international rivals such as Harley Davidson of the 
United States, Triumph of the UK, Ducati of Italy, and BMW of Germany have all been 
aggressively remodeling their own products, improving the quality and speciﬁ cations 
of these machines, setting competitive prices, and stepping up their worldwide market-
ing efforts. To meet these challenges, Kawasaki and Suzuki have now created a strategic 
alliance. 26  This alliance, the ﬁ rst ever in the Japanese motorcycle industry, breaks the 
pattern of each company competing ﬁ ercely with the other three. In particular, the two 
ﬁ rms are going to jointly develop new models and unify their parts procurement and 
production activities in order to cut costs. They also plan on developing and building 
off-road motorcycles and high-powered scooters. The alliance could not have come at 
a better time. Worldwide market demand for motorcycles is poor, and both companies 
have seen declining sales in all three of their market regions: Asia, Europe, and the United 
States. However, the biggest competition is in the large-bike market, and Kawasaki and 
Suzuki intend to bypass this niche and focus instead on small bikes and scooters. The two 
believe that, if they can produce quality products at a competitive price, they can make 
major inroads in China. In the past this market has proved very difﬁ cult for Japanese 
motorcycle makers because Chinese companies have been able to pirate copies of their 
machines and then produce them in their own factories, without fear of any government 
intervention to stop such practices. 27  Under WTO rules this is something that China will 
have to do in the future or run the risk of severe economic retaliation. The decision by 
Kawasaki and Suzuki to form a strategic alliance and focus on China may prove to be a 
very proﬁ table strategic move.

Is the Coca-Cola Company a multinational enterprise? Is it global? Why? 
 Coke indeed is an MNE. The firm conducts production and distribution activities in nations 
other than its home country. And in terms of strategy and management orientation, Coke 
does three things that illustrate its multinational nature. First, the company modifies its 
operations to meet local needs. The firm markets on a country-by-country basis. Second, 
Coke has international partners which help to run the operation and do not report directly 
to the company on day-to-day matters. Third, the multinational relies heavily on teamwork 
by all involved parties and, to a large degree, serves more as a coordinator and cheer-
leader for the product than as an on-site manager. 
 Coke is a global company. Together, the United States and Canada account for just a 
third of its revenues. European and Asian operations are just as important for the com-
pany. No one region absolutely dominates. Unlike MNEs that depend predominantly on 
their home market, Coke has a global view and a global strategy.

 As you have seen from the material in this chapter, the world of international business is 
undergoing a number of major changes. Quite clearly, international business is both an 
interesting and a challenging area! In this book we are going to study what international 
business is all about and what MNEs are now doing in order to compete effectively. In this 
section we examine the current state of the ﬁ eld of international business and then discuss 
the approach that will be used in this book in studying this ﬁ eld. 
  From general to strategic emphasis 
 The ﬁ eld of modern international business began to develop in the 1950s. At this time 
there were not a great number of MNEs and most of them were American. World War II 
had ended less than a decade before and many nations, including Japan and the European 
countries, were more concerned with rebuilding than with overseas investing. Early inter-
national business textbooks were often written by US professors and offered a general, 
descriptive approach to the ﬁ eld. There were few international research studies to provide 
substantive information. International companies that served as teaching examples were 
often those with international divisions, rather than true MNEs. And professors teaching 
international business were frequently educated in areas such as economics or general busi-
ness and relied on an interdisciplinary approach to address the varied needs of the course. 
( Table  1.4 provides additional comparisons.)  
 During the 1970s and 1980s the field of international business changed greatly. The 
economic growth of Europe and Japan, coupled with great strides by newly industrialized 
countries (NICs), resulted in more and more attention being focused on international 
business. Professors were now becoming much more research oriented and the number 
of PhD-granting institutions offering at least a minor in international business began 
to increase. Articles and books by Canadian, European, and Asian professors started to 
appear and US research sophistication significantly improved. International economics

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
and finance now became primary areas of interest and the general research approach of 
the 1950s and 1960s was supplanted by more rigorous quantitative and methodological 
designs. More and more research studies were conducted and the number of journals in 
the field rose sharply. In the latter part of the 1980s we also saw the beginning of efforts 
to bring together much of what was happening into a meaningful composite. How could 
we understand what was going on in the world of international business, when so much 
seemed to be occurring at the same time? It was becoming evident that many of the devel-
opments of the 1970s and 1980s were being studied in too micro a fashion and a more 
macro approach to the field was needed. 
 The 1990s saw the emergence of a strategic management focus for drawing together 
the field of international business. The descriptive ideas of the 1950s and 1960s and the 
analytical ideas of the 1970s and 1980s were now being combined into an integrative 
approach. Historical and quantitative research was now being incorporated into models 
for describing, explaining, and helping predict what was happening in the international 
business arena. The earlier interdisciplinary and functional approaches were being supple-
mented by a multidisciplinary approach that drew on information from a wide variety of 
disciplines that affected international business. New journals in the field were also taking a 
more strategic management view of developments. This theme of   strategic management , 
managerial actions that include strategy formulation, strategy implementation, evaluation, 
and control, encompasses a wide range of activities, including environmental analysis of 
external and internal conditions and evaluation of organizational strengths and weak-
nesses. In this text strategic management will serve as the basis for our overall framework.

how MNEs integrate these concepts into their overall strategy. 
 FRAMEWORK FOR THIS BOOK 

27
CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
 There are five major parts in this text. Part One is an introduction and encompasses this 
chapter and  Chapters 2  and  3 . The focus of attention in this part of the book is on such 
areas as imports, exports, FDI, the nature of MNEs, and the role and importance of the 
triad. Part Two examines the environments of international business with particular atten-
tion on international politics, culture, trade, and finance. Part Three focuses on overall 
international business strategies with a new chapter on Entrepreneurship and Innovation 
(Chapter 11). Part Four focuses on functional area strategies with particular attention to 
production strategy, marketing strategy, human resource management strategy, political 
risk, negotiation strategies, and international financial management and accounting. Part 
Five looks at the ways in which the information presented thus far in the book is being 
used by organizations to do business internationally. In this part, specific attention is given 
to strategic alliances, the flagship framework, and ways of doing business in the EU, Asia, 
North America, and emerging economies, including China. 
  Figure   1.1    presents an illustration of the model that will be used throughout this book. 
The current chapter has set the stage for the study of international business. In  Chapter 2  
we will examine the key actor on this stage: the MNE.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 1   International business is the study of transactions taking place across national borders 
for the purpose of satisfying the needs of individuals and organizations. Two of the most 
common types of international business activity are export/import and foreign direct 
investment (FDI). In recent years both have been on the rise. Much of this is a result 
of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) that are headquartered in triad countries. 
In particular, triad members account for most of the worldwide trade and FDI. The 
majority of trade is intra-regional.  
 2   Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often function as the backbone of large 
MNEs, efficiently providing goods and services that are integrated into the production 
process of large MNEs. SMEs also compete with MNEs in niche markets.  
 3   Trade regulation has become an important issue in international business. Today the 
World Trade Organization is the major group responsible for governing the inter-
national trading system.  
 4   Changes taking place in both communication and production technologies are trans-
forming the way in which MNEs do business.  
 5   One way in which MNEs are competing is by drawing up strategies that focus on regions 
and geographic areas, thus ensuring that they are addressing the needs of their local 
customers. Another way is by continuing to be innovative. A third is by maintaining 
competitive position by addressing the determinants of national competitive advantage: 
(a) creating the necessary factor conditions; (b) having strong local demand for the 
goods and services that are being produced; (c) having related and supporting industries 
that are internationally competitive; and (d) having a suitable strategy and structure and 
domestic rivalry that encourages continued innovation.

Real Case
Big oil gets bigger
Between 1998 and 2009 there were a series of mergers in 
the oil industry that resulted in a handful of private com-
panies emerging as dominant players. In the United States 
the largest of these was Exxon Mobil, the result of a 1999 
merger. In 2009 this company had sales of $284.650 billion 
(see Table 1).

In Europe mergers and acquisitions had created two 
dominant firms. Royal Dutch Shell Group is the largest with 
$285.129 billion in revenues, overtaking BP. In 2002, Royal 
Dutch Shell purchased Pennzoil-Quaker State for $1.8 
billion and consistently purchases stakes in other compa-
nies. Unlike most of its competitors, however, Royal Dutch 
has remained clear of any major mergers with competitors 
and has instead opted to rely on restructuring of its opera-
tions to remain competitive. 
With $246.138 billion in revenues, the next largest 
European firm in the oil industry is BP. In 1998 Amoco 
merged with BP and subsequently the firm acquired a 
number of other companies, including Arco and Burmah 
Castrol. However, in 2010, BP had to conduct a massive 
divestment to raise funds of $30 billion by the end of 2011 
to help meet the legal obligations for the environmental 
clean up arising from the explosion and fire accident on the 
Deep Horizon Rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010.
The fourth and fifth largest oil firms are Sinopec and 
China National Petroleum from China.
Texaco and Chevron merged in 2000 creating the world’s 
sixth-largest oil firm. In 2001, Oklahoma-based Phillips 
Petroleum acquired Tosco, a major oil refiner. Soon after, 
Phillips merged into Conoco. Conoco Phillips is the world’s 
eighth-largest oil firm, with revenues of $139.515 billion.
The seventh-largest firm in the industry is French-based 
Total, the result of a merger between Total Fina and Elf in 
2000. Today the firm has revenues of $155.887 billion.
This pattern of increasing company size through acqui­
sitions has also been occurring in Asia. In 1999 Nippon Oil 
bought Mitsubishi Oil, creating Japan’s largest oil com-
pany. In 2005, Nippon Oil merged with Nippon Petroleum 
Gas. In 2006 Nippon Oil had revenues of $48.01 billion. In 
2008, Nippon Oil conducted a management integration with 
Kyushu Oil.
Why are these oil companies merging? One of the main 
reasons is that the maturity of existing oil fields is forcing 
companies to search for new oil deposits in areas that 
are not easily accessible. Oil exploration in mountainous 
t

regions, the frigid Arctic, and ocean depths of more than a 
mile (1.6 km) requires extremely large capital outlays and 
entails a great deal of risk. In addition, these firms have 
to invest millions of dollars in research and development 
and sometimes end up spending years negotiating with 
governments for the right to drill for oil in the country (or 
in offshore waters that are controlled by them) and to build 
refineries and pipelines there. Only large companies with 
enormous financial resources are able to do this. State-
owned oil MNEs are major competitors (see  Table  2 ) and 
often hold a privileged position when accessing their own 
country’s reserves. Moreover, if a company has a major 
oil strike, it has to be able to take advantage of economies 
of scale in order to bring the oil to market at competitive 
prices. Again, this development favors large firms. This 
is why experts in the energy business predict that there 
will be continual mergers and acquisitions in the industry 
as the large firms jockey for position and acquire smaller 
rivals and others in complementary businesses such as 
chemicals and oil-related products.

and Royal Dutch/Shell MNEs? What criteria do they 
meet that makes them MNEs?   
 2 How important is an understanding of governmental 
regulation to success in this industry?   
 3 In terms of Porter’s determinants of national 
competitive advantage, which one of these four 
determinants is most important for these oil 
companies? Why? 
 Wal-Mart 
 In 2001, Wal-Mart became the world’s biggest company in 
terms of sales revenues, a title it has kept to date, a breath-
taking achievement for the company that Sam Walton 
started in Arkansas as recently as 1962. Indeed, with 
revenues of $408.214 billion for the year ending in 2009, 
Wal-Mart is now ahead of General Motors and Exxon Mobil. 
The second-largest retailer, Carrefour with revenues of 
$121.452, is only about one-fourth the size of Wal-Mart. 
 Wal-Mart’s success can be attributed to a scale strat-
egy based on reduction of costs to steadily generate its 
“always low prices” formula and physical growth or mar-
ket coverage. The United States offers the perfect land-
scape for Wal-Mart’s expansion. Large, wealthy suburbs 
with vast, inexpensive land allow the firm to set up huge 
warehouse-style retail centers, reducing overall prices. 
This is complemented by an entrepreneurial culture in 
which store managers have a lot of decision-making power. 
Wal-Mart pushes its suppliers to provide the best product 
they can at the lowest possible price, making its products 
of better quality than those of other discount stores. 
 Presently, Wal-Mart commands an 8 percent share of 
the retail sales in its home market and its growth shows 
no signs of slowing down any time soon. The firm’s critics 
accuse it of exploiting its workers, destroying traditional 
retail stores, and eroding the manufacturing industry by 
importing from countries with low labor costs, among other 
things. Even those who sympathize with objectors, however, 
might not resist saving $100 for an appliance. The criticism 
can be argued both ways. Some traditional retail stores suf-
fered as a result of Wal-Mart’s expansion, but if Wal-Mart

CHAPTER 1 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL STRATEGY
sets up shop in a run-down mall, neighboring stores benefit 
from the increased traffic. This might include dollar-stores, 
haircutting places, and sportswear outlets, among others. 
Wal-Mart’s bicycle section falls short of offering all the 
equipment, not to mention the service, of a traditional 
bicycle store. A mother buying her daughter her first bicycle 
might go to Wal-Mart, but a young woman looking for qual-
ity, accessories, service, and a knowledgeable salesperson 
might instead visit her local bike store. The same can be 
said for most product sections within the store. Large 
competitors have either stopped competing with Wal-Mart 
or sought to beat it at its own game. Indeed, Wal-Mart may 
be responsible for a more consumer-oriented retail service 
sector in the United States. 
 One main criticism of Wal-Mart is its dependence on 
imports from low-cost countries such as China. In 2003, 
the firm purchased approximately $15 billion in Chinese 
products, a fraction of revenues perhaps, but a sizeable 
amount just above the total revenues of McDonald’s for the 
same year. Here, Wal-Mart had done nothing more than 
take advantage of the opportunities, available to all US 
retailers, that arose from the liberalization of China. 
 Those things that have helped Wal-Mart grow might 
be the same things that eventually will halt its growth. 
Low-cost laborers have a higher turnover. The firm hires 
approximately 600,000 new employees a year, and if it 
wants to reduce the costs of searching for personnel and 
training them, it might find that increased salaries and 
benefits are its only alternative. The firm has been con-
stantly lowering the prices of its products, but this too will 
come to a stop when it exploits all available opportunities 
in low-cost areas and as China begins to see its produc-
tion costs increase in the face of development. Finally, 
the entrepreneurial nature of Wal-Mart’s decentralized 
business structure has meant that the organization lacks a 
coordinated bureaucracy with the power to impose corpo-
rate rules on store managers. For that reason, the firm is 
now being plagued with lawsuits, including a class action 
suit by its female employees for gender discrimination. 
 For future long-term growth, Wal-Mart has looked 
beyond its borders. However, while it has done extremely 
well in Canada, Mexico, and the UK, it has had a rough time 
in other markets, including Germany, Japan and Korea. 
 Wal-Mart’s international expansion began in 1992 when 
it entered into a joint venture with Cifra SA, a successful 
Mexican retailer, in which it held 50 percent interest in 
its partner’s retail operations. In 1998, Wal-Mart acquired 
a controlling interest in Cifra and officially changed the 
company’s name to Wal-Mart of Mexico in 2000. Wal-Mart 
entered Canada in 1994 when it acquired 122 Woolco 
stores. Since then, the firm has established itself success-
fully in the markets of its NAFTA partners. One reason for 
this success is that it can rely on suppliers for its US stores 
to deliver products for the Canadian and Mexican market. 
In addition, the landscape, culture, and economic situation 
in Canada are much like in the United States. 
 The group entered Europe in the late 1990s, by purchas-
ing the Wertkauf and Interspar supermarkets in Germany. 
Here, Wal-Mart ran into some trouble. Competitors in 
Europe had emulated the company’s most successful 
strategies in cost reduction and supply-chain manage-
ment, reducing Wal-Mart’s relative competitive advantage. 
In Germany, local competitors offer very low prices, and 
Wal-Mart is not big enough to achieve the local economies 
of scale required to compete on price alone. There was also 
a different cost structure. Real estate development, when 
possible, was more costly and wages were also higher. The 
scale effect does not work in Europe. When the company 
must source 90 percent of its goods locally, which bargain 
or logistics savings can it cash in with so few stores? To top 
it all, Wal-Mart’s US managers had problems adapting to 
the culture and did not speak German. 
 Wal-Mart entered the British market by acquiring ASDA 
and retained the name. ASDA had already adopted a focus 
on low prices and so it had exactly the type of consumer that 
Wal-Mart was looking for. Even though it has done relatively 
well in England, a low-cost strategy was secondary to devel-
oping long-term relationships with suppliers of well-known, 
quality-oriented, differentiated brands. 
 Wal-Mart launched its first store in South Korea in 1998, 
but in 2005, it ranked bottom of the nation’s five discount 
store chains. Wal-Mart lost about 9.9 billion won in 2005 
from its business in Korea, on sales of 750 billion won. 
In 2006, Wal-Mart pulled out of South Korea—selling its 
16 Korean stores to the country’s biggest discount chain. 
Shinsegae paid 825 billion won ($882 million) for Wal-
Mart’s South Korean operations. 
 Time, patient investment, and key expertise in each 
 foreign market may help Wal-Mart to successfully expand 
its international operations to become a more international 
player. Until then, however, the firm remains extremely 
NAFTA focused.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Most of the best-known companies in the world are multinational 
enterprises, and many of their names are easily recognized because 
their products and services are so popular. This is true for US 
multinational enterprises, such as General Electric, Exxon Mobil, 
and Ford, but for others as well. Consider, for example, some of the 
largest industrial multinationals headquartered in the European 
Union: Unilever (UK/Netherlands), Fiat (Italy), Nokia (Finland), 
Volkswagen (Germany), Philips (Netherlands), and Peugeot (France); 
and in Japan: Sony, Fuji, and Toyota. There are also MNEs from 
non-triad areas such as Sinopec (China), Samsung (South Korea), 
Codelco (Chile), AngloGold (South Africa), and Bombardier (Canada). 
The primary objective of this chapter is to examine the nature and 
operations of multinational enterprises. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Describe  the characteristics of multinational enterprises.  
 2  Explain  the internationalization process.  
 3  Explain  why firms become multinational enterprises.  
 4  Discuss  the strategic philosophy of these firms.  
 5  Introduce  a country/firm framework for examining a firm’s 
competitiveness. 
 6  Study  some of the ways in which these firms use strategic 
management.

CHAPTER 2 THE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE
 Between 1988 and 1990 three $150 million amusement 
parks opened in France. By 1991 two of them were bank-
rupt and the third was doing poorly. Despite this, the Walt 
Disney Company went ahead with a plan to open Europe’s 
first Disneyland in 1992. Far from being concerned about 
the theme park doing well, Disney executives were wor-
ried that Euro Disneyland would be too small to handle 
the giant crowds. The $4.4 billion project was to be located 
on 5,000 acres in Seine-et-Marne, 20 miles (32 km) east 
of Paris. And the city seemed to be an excellent location; 
there were 17 million people within a two-hour drive of 
Euro Disneyland, 41 million within a four-hour drive, and 
109 million within six hours of the park. This included people 
from seven countries: France, Switzerland, Germany, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK. 
 Disney officials were optimistic about the project. Their 
US parks, Disneyland and Disneyworld, were extremely 
successful, and Tokyo Disneyland was so popular that on 
some days it could not accommodate the large number 
of visitors. Simply put, the company was making a great 
deal of money from its parks. However, the Tokyo park was 
franchised to others—and Disney management felt that it 
had given up too much profit with this arrangement. This 
would not be the case at Euro Disneyland. The company’s 
share of the venture was to be 49 percent for which it would 
put up $160 million. Other investors put in $1.2 billion, 
the French government provided a low-interest $900 mil-
lion loan, banks loaned the business $1.6 billion, and the 
remaining $400 million was to come from special partner-
ships formed to buy properties and to lease them back. For 
its investment and management of the operation, the Walt 
Disney Company was to receive 10 percent of Euro Disney’s 
admission fees, 5 percent of food and merchandise rev-
enues, and 49 percent of all profits. 
 The location of the amusement park was thoroughly 
researched. The number of people who could be attracted 
to various locations throughout Europe and the amount of 
money they were likely to spend during a visit to the park 
were carefully calculated. In the end, France and Spain 
had proved to offer the best locations. Both countries 
were well aware of the park’s capability for creating jobs 
and stimulating their economy. As a result, each actively 
wooed the company. In addition to offering a central loca-
tion in the heart of Europe, France was prepared to provide 
considerable financial incentives. Among other things, the 
French government promised to build a train line to con-
nect the amusement park to the European train system. 
Thus after carefully comparing the advantages offered by 
both  countries, France was chosen as the site for the park. 
 At first things appeared to be off to a roaring start. 
Unfortunately, by the time the park was ready to open, a 
number of problems had developed, and some of these had 
a very dampening effect on early operations. One was the 
concern of some French people that Euro Disney was noth-
ing more than a transplanting of Disneyland into Europe. 
In their view the park did not fit into the local culture, and 
some of the French press accused Disney of “cultural 
imperialism.” Others objected to the fact that the French 
government, as promised in the contract, had expropri-
ated the necessary land and sold it without profit to the 
Euro Disneyland development people. Signs reading “Don’t 
gnaw away our national wealth” and “Disney go home” 
began appearing along roadways. These negative feelings 
may well have accounted for the fact that on opening day 
only 50,000 visitors showed up, in contrast to the 500,000 
that were expected. Soon thereafter, operations at the park 
came under criticism from both visitors and employees. 
Many visitors were upset about the high prices. In the 
case of British tourists, for example, because of the franc 
exchange rate, it was cheaper for them to go to Florida 
than to Euro Disney. In the case of employees, many of 
them objected to the pay rates and the working conditions. 
They also raised concerns about a variety of company poli-
cies ranging from personal grooming to having to speak 
English in meetings, even if most people in attendance 
spoke French. Within the first month 3,000 employees 
quit. Some of the other operating problems were a result 
of Disney’s previous experiences. In the United States, 
for example, liquor was not sold outside of the hotels or 
specific areas. The general park was kept alcohol free, 
including the restaurants, in order to maintain a family 
atmosphere. In Japan, this policy was accepted and worked 
very well. However, Europeans were used to having out-
ings with alcoholic beverages. As a result of these types of 
problems, Euro Disney soon ran into financial problems. 
 In 1994, after three years of heavy losses, the operation 
was in such bad shape that some people were predicting 
that the park would close. However, a variety of develop-
ments saved the operation. For one thing, a major investor 
purchased 24.6 percent (reducing Disney’s share to 39 per-
cent) of the company, injecting $500 million of much needed 
cash. Additionally, Disney waived its royalty fees and worked 
out a new loan repayment plan with the banks, and new 
shares were issued. These measures allowed Euro Disney

to buy time while it restructured its marketing and general 
policies to fit the European market. 
 In October 1994, Euro Disney officially changed its name 
to “Disneyland Paris.” This made the park more French and 
permitted it to capitalize on the romanticism that the word 
“Paris” conveys. Most importantly, the new name allowed 
for a new beginning, disassociating the park from the fail-
ure of Euro Disney. This was accompanied with measures 
designed to remedy past failures. The park changed its most 
offensive labor rules, reduced prices, and began being more 
culturally conscious. Among other things, alcoholic bever-
ages were now allowed to be served just about anywhere. 
 The company also began making the park more appeal-
ing to local visitors by giving it a “European” focus: 92 per-
cent of the park’s visitors are from eight nearby European 
countries. Disney Tomorrowland, with its dated images of 
the space age, was jettisoned entirely and replaced by a 
gleaming brass and wood complex called Discoveryland, 
which was based on themes of Jules Verne and Leonardo 
da Vinci. In Disneyland food services were designed to 
reflect the fable’s country of origin: Pinocchio’s facility 
served German food, Cinderella’s had French offerings, 
and at Bella Notte’s the cuisine was Italian. The company 
also shot a 360-degree movie about French culture and 
showed it in the “Visionarium” exhibit.   
 These changes were designed to draw more visitors, and 
they seemed to have worked. Disneyland Paris reported a 
slight profit in 1996, and the park continued to make a mod-
est profit through to the early 2000s. In 2002 and 2003, the 
company was once again making losses, and new deals had 
to be worked out with creditors. This time, however, it wasn’t 
insensitivity to local customs but a slump in the travel and 
tourism industry, strikes and stoppages in France, and an 
economic downturn in many of the surrounding markets.

 Euro Disney has cut its annual losses by 28 percent, 
despite a fall in visitor numbers to Disneyland Paris. The 
company that runs the theme park said its net loss for 
the 12 months to 30 September, 2010 was €45.2m ($62m; 
£38m), down from €63m a year ago. Euro Disney said that 
while visitor numbers to Disneyland Paris fell 2.6 percent 
to 15 million, average spending per tourist rose 2.4 per-
cent to €45.30. Annual revenues at the company were up 
4 percent to €1.28bn. Euro Disney is 40 percent owned 
by Walt Disney, 10 percent by the Saudi royal family, and 
50 percent by other shareholders. Philippe Gas, Euro Disney 
chief executive, said that despite a difficult economic con-
text, Disneyland Paris remained Europe’s most popular 
tourist destination.

 A  multinational enterprise (MNE)   is a company that is headquartered in one country but 
has operations in one or more other countries. Sometimes it is difﬁ cult to know if a ﬁ rm 
is an MNE because multinationals often downplay the fact that they are foreign held. For

example, many people are unaware that Bayer, the drug company, is German owned; Nestlé, 
the chocolate manufacturer, is a Swiss company; NEC is Japanese; and Tata of Mumbai, 
India, now owns Jaguar, the British-based auto maker. Similarly, approximately 25 percent 
of banks in California are Japanese owned, but this is often not evident from their names. 
Simply put, many large MNEs have world holdings far beyond what is known to the casual 
observer. A closer look at these MNEs will reveal the impact they have on international 
business and the world economy.   
 The United Nations has identiﬁ ed over 60,000 MNEs, but the largest 500 account for 
80 percent of the world’s foreign direct investment.       1  Table  2.1 shows the distribution of the 
world’s largest 500 ﬁ rms, most of which are MNEs. Of these, 370 are from the core “triad.” 
There are 160 from the EU, 139 from the United States and 71 from Japan. The fact that 
nearly 80 percent of the world’s largest 500 MNEs are from the core triad is highly sig-
niﬁ cant. It means that the triad is the basic unit of analysis for MNE strategy. Also, about 
80–85 percent of the world’s top MNEs have been from the triad for the past 20–30 years.       2 
Total annual sales of these 500 ﬁ rms are in excess of $23 trillion. 3  These ﬁ rms are engaged 
in a wide variety of operations including autos, chemicals, computers, consumer goods, 
ﬁ nancial services, industrial equipment, and oil and steel production. 
 The names of the largest triad-based MNEs, as well as those from non-triad countries, 
are listed in the Appendix,  Tables   2A   –   2D   . There are now 73 MNEs from the emerging 
economies of China, Korea, and India, as well as several others from similar economies. 
You should become familiar with at least some of these MNEs as we proceed through this 
book. We provide the websites for all the MNEs we discuss in the cases.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Characteristics of MNEs 
 One way of identifying the characteristics of MNEs is by looking at the environment in 
which they operate.  Figure   2.1    shows some of the major forces in this environment. Notice 
that an MNE has two major areas of concern: the home country of its headquarters and 
the host countries in which it does business. Stakeholders are not included within these 
two areas of  Figure   2.1    because they can come from anywhere in the world. For example, 
an investor in Switzerland can purchase stock in Sears Roebuck even though the company 
does not do business in Switzerland.   
 One characteristic of MNEs is that their affiliates must be responsive to a number of 
important environmental forces, including competitors, customers, suppliers, financial 
institutions, and government (again see  Figure   2.1   ). In some cases the same forces are at 
work in both the home- and host-country environments. For example, many of Ford’s 
competitors in the US market are the same as those in Europe: Toyota, BMW,  Daimler, 
Honda, and Volkswagen, among others. Similarly, MNEs often use the same suppliers 
overseas that they employ domestically, and it is common to find home-country-based 
suppliers following their MNE customer to other geographic locales in order to provide 
the same types of services worldwide. In other cases, however, these same environmental 
factors can be very different on each of the markets in which the firm operates. 
 A second characteristic of an MNE is that it draws on a common pool of resources, 
including assets, patents, trademarks, information, and human resources. Because the affili-
ates are all part of the same company, they have access to assets that are often not available 
to outsiders. For example, both Ford and General Motors compete vigorously in Europe 
and many of the design and styling changes developed for their European cars have now 
been introduced in US models. The flow of information and technology between European 
and US affiliates has led to success in the worldwide market for many MNEs. Similarly, if 
an affiliate needs expansion funds, an MNE will often help out by working with the affiliate 
to raise the money. If a loan is needed, the affiliate is likely to find many financial insti-
tutions that are willing to provide the money because the MNE will back the loan. 
 A third characteristic of an MNE is that it links together the affiliates and business part-
ners with a common strategic vision. Simply put, all of the firms with whom the MNE works 
fit into the company’s overall plan of what it wants to do and how it intends to go about 
implementing this strategy. General Motors (GM) used to be a good example. The auto 
firm relied heavily on partnerships to help it grow.       4  GM realized that no auto maker has all 
of the resources for achieving leadership in every region of the world or in every product 
segment. As a result, the company  formed a manufacturing partnership with Toyota to 
conduct research and development on fuel cell and gas–electric hybrid vehicles. GM also 
created an alliance with Fuji Heavy Industries and its Subaru brand that allowed GM to ben-
efit from Fuji’s strengths in small sport utility vehicles, continuously variable transmissions, 
and all-wheel-drive systems and, in turn, gave Fuji access to GM’s vehicle platforms and 
other important manufacturing technologies. Today the company has been restructured

following its bankruptcy in 2008/9 after the international financial crisis.  Part of its failure 
was its diversification into financing whereby its credit division diverted it from its core 
business. And its Japanese competitors ended up making better cars—with better quality 
and lower prices. Today China and India are becoming big players in the car business.

 What are some of the characteristics of multinational enterprises that are 
displayed by the Walt Disney Company? 
 One of the characteristics of an MNE is that ties of common ownership link affiliated firms. 
In this case the Walt Disney Company holds a substantial interest in Disneyland Paris, in 
addition to its ownership of Disneyland and Disneyworld in the United States. A second 
characteristic is that the MNE draws on a common pool of resources. One way Euro Disney 
does this is through the use of trademarks and characters (Mickey Mouse, Goofy, Donald 
Duck) and the experience of the Disney team in setting up and running similar theme parks 
in the United States. A third characteristic is that MNEs have a common strategy for linking 
together the affiliates. The Walt Disney Company does this through its overall plan, such 
as the one it used for deciding where to set up Euro Disney and how to manage the park.    
 The internationalization process 
 Not all international business is done by MNEs. Indeed, setting up a wholly owned sub-
sidiary is usually the last stage of doing business abroad, as is shown in  Figure  2.2   . 
  Figure   2.2    outlines the typical process by which a firm producing a standardized prod-
uct will seek to involve itself in a foreign market.       5  This, however, is a generalization as 
firms ultimately make decisions depending on their particular circumstances. The process 
we illustrate here, however, is important because it is based on how the firm perceives risk 
and how it deals with it. In this   internationalization   process the firm regards foreign mar-
kets as risky due to the fact that, as these markets are unknown to it, the firm faces export 
 Figure 2.2  Entry into foreign markets: the internationalization process

market 

42
PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
marketing costs. To avoid such information costs and risk, its strategy is to go abroad at a 
slow and cautious pace, often using the services of specialists in international trade outside 
the firm. Over time, familiarity with the foreign environment will reduce the information 
costs and help to alleviate the perceived risk of foreign involvement. There is a “learning” 
effect as firms become familiar with a foreign market. 6    
 Initially the firm may seek to avoid the risks of foreign involvement by arranging a 
joint venture or a license. A   license   is a contractual arrangement in which one firm, the 
 licensor  , provides access to some of its patents, trademarks, or technology to another firm, 
the   licensee  , in exchange for a fee or royalty. This fee often involves a fixed amount upon 
signing the contract and then a royalty of 2–5 percent on sales generated by the agree-
ment. A typical licensing contract will run from five to seven years and be renewable at the 
option of either or both parties. This strategy is most suitable for a standardized product 
where there is no risk of dissipation of the firm’s technological or managerial advantages. 
Otherwise, licensing will be reserved for a much later stage of entry. Indeed, when it is 
important for the firm to retain control over its firm-specific advantage in technology (as 
in internalization theory), 7  licensing will be the last stage of entry. The firms involved in the 
process of internationalization, on the other hand, typically are not concerned about losing 
their firm-specific advantages. Rather, they want to avoid exposure to an uncertain foreign 
environment. Abstracting from the licensing option (and the more complex problem of 
joint ventures), the major types of foreign entry for a firm are as follows:     
 1   The firm sees potential extra sales by  exporting  and uses a  local agent or distributor to 
enter a particular market. Often the firm uses exporting as a “vent” for its surplus pro-
duction and may have no long-run commitment to the international market. If it does 
well abroad, however, it may then set up its own local sales representative or marketing 
subsidiary, in the hope of securing a more stable stream of export sales. 
 2   As exports come to represent a larger share of sales, the firm may increase its capacity to 
serve the export market. It will set an office for its  sales representative  in a major market, 
or set up a  sales subsidiary . This stage marks an important departure for the firm from 
simply viewing exports as a marginal contributor to sales volume or as a vent for sur-
plus in times of excess capacity. At this stage the firm will often set up a separate  export 
department  to manage foreign sales and production for such markets and product design 
and the production process itself may be modified to tailor products for export markets.  
 3   After the firm has become more familiar with the local market, some of the uncertainty 
associated with foreign involvement has been overcome. Now the firm may begin to 
move on the foreign production side. Initially it may start to use host-country workers to 
engage in  local assembly and packaging  of its product lines. This is a crucial step, because 
the firm is now involved in the host-country factor market and must deal with such 
environmental variables as wage rates, cultural attitudes, and worker expectations in its 
new labor force.  
 4   The final stage of foreign involvement comes when the firm has generated sufficient 
knowledge about the host country to overcome its perceptions of risk. Because it is 
more familiar with the host-country environment, it may now consider a  foreign direct 
investment  (FDI) activity. In this it produces the entire product line in the host nation 
and sells its output there, or it may even be able to re-export back to the home country. 
These decisions depend on the relative country-specific costs; for example, if labor is 
inexpensive in the host nation (as in South-East Asia), more exporting takes place than 
if it is expensive (as in Western Europe and the United States).   
 It has become clear that the internationalization process is more complicated than it 
seems at first glance. Like all generalizations, this schematic path of export commitment

relies on simplifications. In reality, the process of foreign entry is sufficiently complicated 
to depend on a careful weighing of many firm-specific and country-specific factors. A 
framework to model these firm-specific advantages (FSAs) and country-specific advan-
tages (CSAs) is developed in the next section.

 Why did Disney take an ownership position in the firm rather than simply 
licensing some other firm to build and operate the park and settling for a 
royalty on all sales? 
 Disney believed that the theme park was too lucrative a venture to settle for just a royalty 
on sales. The company felt that it would be giving up too much to simply “take the money 
and run” when by remaining and managing the operation it could garner a great deal 
more revenue. Moreover, not only is the revenue potential of the park extremely high, but 
Disney’s initial investment of $160 million was extremely low given the amount of control it 
maintains and the fees and profits that would be generated should the park prove as highly 
attractive as company executives were forecasting. Disney also wanted to retain control 
over its brand name products and services in order to prevent imitation by substandard 
rivals, and this is best done with an ownership position.      
  Why firms become MNEs 
 Companies become MNEs for a number of reasons. One is to  diversify  themselves against 
the risks and uncertainties of the domestic business cycle. By setting up operations in 
another country, multinationals can often diminish the negative effects of economic swings 
in the home country. This is a form of international diversiﬁ cation, and it has been widely 
used by Japanese MNEs, for example, which have found that, while their home economy 
has been in an economic slump since the 1990s, their US operations have done quite well. 
 A second reason is to tap the growing world market for goods and services. For example, 
many MNEs have targeted the United States because of its large population and high per 
capita income. It is the world’s single largest market in terms of gross domestic product. 
And since Americans have both a desire for new goods and services and the money to buy 
them, the United States can be an ideal market. MNEs are also targeting China. Although 
per capita gross domestic product is not very high, the country’s large population and 
growing economy make it very attractive to multinationals. In 2001, China entered the 
World Trade Organization, and this acceptance of international rules made China more 
attractive for MNEs. 
 Firms also become MNEs in response to increased foreign competition and a desire to 
protect their home market share. Using a  follow the competitor  strategy, a growing number 
of MNEs now set up operations in the home countries of their major competitors. This 
approach serves a dual purpose: (1) it takes away business from their competitors by offer-
ing customers other choices; and (2) it lets competitors know that, if they attack the MNE’s 
home market, they will face a similar response. This strategy of staking out global market 
shares is particularly important when MNEs want to communicate the conditions under 
which they will retaliate. 
 A fourth reason why companies become an MNE is to reduce costs. By setting up oper-
ations close to the foreign customer, these firms can eliminate transportation expenses, 

44
PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
avoid the overhead associated with having intermediaries handle the product, respond more 
accurately and rapidly to customer needs, and take advantage of local resources. This process, 
known as  internalization  of control within the MNE, can help to reduce overall costs.   
 A fifth reason is to overcome  protective  devices such as tariff and non-tariff barriers 
by serving a foreign market from within. The EU provides an excellent example. Firms 
outside the EU are subject to tariffs on goods exported to EU countries. Firms producing 
the goods within the EU, however, can transport them to any other country in the bloc 
without paying tariffs. The same is now occurring in North America, thanks to the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has eliminated tariffs among Canada, 
the United States, and Mexico. 
 A sixth reason for becoming an MNE is to take advantage of technological expertise by 
manufacturing goods directly (by FDI) rather than allowing others to do it under a license. 
Although the benefits of a licensing agreement are obvious, in recent years some MNEs 
have concluded that it is unwise to give another firm access to proprietary information 
such as patents, trademarks, or technological expertise, and they have allowed current 
licensing agreements to lapse. This has allowed them to reclaim their exclusive rights and 
then to manufacture and directly sell the products in overseas markets. 
 Italian family firms 
 In Italy more than 90 percent of all small and medium-
sized companies and some of the largest enterprises 
are family owned. In the fashion industry, for example, 
Versace, Missoni, and Benetton are family-held firms. In 
addition, Italian families own important manufacturers 
and hold operating control of some of the major banks 
and transportation companies in the country. For exam-
ple, in 2009, the Fiat SpA Group’s annual revenue is 
€50.102 billion and employs 190,014 people. It does this 
as a conglomerate consisting of 777 firms with holdings 
in agricultural and construction equipment, automobiles, 
aviation, commercial vehicles, communications, insurance 
services, metallurgical products, production systems, 
and publishing. 
 Another large family-owned Italian company is Pirelli 
&C SpA, which, in 2009, has had annual revenues of over 
€4.462 billion and employs about 29,570 people. Most of 
the firm’s revenues (82 percent) are generated from its 
tire and cable businesses. Along with Benetton, Pirelli 
bought a controlling interest in Olivetti, the giant Italian 
computer and telecommunications corporation. Through 
Olimpia, Pirelli has an 18 percent stake in Telecom Italia 
SpA, a telecommunications, information, and communi-
cation technology company with annual revenues of 
€27.163 billion and a workforce of around 73,533 people in 
2009. This acquisition has also brought both Benetton and 
Pirelli into the wireless telecommunications business. 
 These two examples, Fiat and Pirelli, are typical of 
the holdings and influence of large Italian families in the 
 country. Through their vast holdings and political power, 
they have been able to maintain a tight rein on various 
sectors of the economy. In addition, these family firms are 
protected against foreign investment by a secretive bank-
ing system that is headed by the Milan Bank, Mediobanca. 
This bank has financed nearly all of the takeover deals in 
Italy during the last 35 years. The bank also holds board 
positions on many of the country’s conglomerates. 
 On a macro basis, the Italian business system reflects 
the twin pressures of local family culture and the increas-
ing demands of international business. Like their larger 
counterparts, small and medium-sized family businesses 
are now using their personal and business networks to 
create MNEs that are branching out into the EU, as well 
as putting together deals in both North America and Asia.

CHAPTER 2 THE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE
 Firms become MNEs for the same reasons they engage in FDI. The next chapter will 
provide a more detailed examination of some of the reasons introduced in this chapter.  
  The strategic philosophy of MNEs 
 MNEs make decisions based on what is best for the overall company, even if this means 
transferring jobs to other countries and cutting back the local workforce. In the past dec-
ade IBM, ABB, and Sony, for example, have spent considerable sums of money to train and 
develop local managers to handle overseas operations because the companies are ﬁ nding 
that these managers are often much more effective than those sent from the home country. 
MNEs also hire large numbers of non-managerial workers in overseas countries. For 
example, US-based Ford Motor has 66,000 employees in Europe and 15,000 employees in 
the Asia–Paciﬁ c region. European ﬁ rm Siemens has 277,000 employees outside Germany.       8 
 As a result there is a great deal of economic interaction in the international arena, giving 
business firms headquartered in one country a significant impact on the economies of other 
countries. This is true both when things are going well as well as when they are not. For 
example, with the recent slowdown of the world economy more and more MNEs are now 
trimming their workforces. Alcatel, the giant French telecommunications equipment maker, 
announced plans to cut 29 percent of its workforce and to reduce its factories to a dozen, using 
outsourcing to handle all other production needs.       9  Philips, the giant Dutch electronics firm, 
reacted to a severe slowdown in demand for mobile phones and semiconductors, and elimi-
nated more than 7,000 jobs; 10  and Disney cut 4,000 positions, about 3 percent of its worldwide 
workforce. 11  These decisions were made to improve the situation of the company as a unit. 
 This same worldwide approach to operations can be seen in the way MNEs team up to 
get things done. One example is Embraer of Brazil, the fourth-largest aircraft manufac-
turer in the world. The company teamed up with 22 of its main suppliers, many of which 
are Japanese, to introduce a new family of aircraft. Suppliers became risk investors and 
by funding Embraer’s plan secured future contracts from the company. 12  For more on 
Embraer, see the Real Case in  Chapter 4 . Another example is provided by the production 
of the V2500 engine by a consortium led by US Pratt & Whitney and British Rolls-Royce. 
Other partners are Japanese Aero Engines and Germany’s MTU Aero Engines.       13 Simply 
put, MNEs make whatever agreements are in their best interests, even if this means bring-
ing in firms from three or four different countries.

 In what way did Euro Disney reflect the strategic philosophy of Walt Disney as 
a multinational enterprise? 
 One way in which Euro Disney reflects the strategic philosophy of the company as an 
MNE is that Disney is willing to modify the park to meet the preferences of local visitors 
by catering to their markets. Euro Disney is not identical to Disneyland in California. The 
focus on European roots and culture is now an integral part of the park. In addition, notice 
how the company used an international approach to funding the project. The monies were 
not all raised in France. The government helped, but so did banks, private investors, and 
Disney itself. And when the operation ran into trouble, the company was willing to recon-
figure its arrangement and give up some ownership and some revenue in order to get 
things back on an even keel.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
  Table   2.2    reports the geographical expansion between 1970 and 2000 of four of the 
world’s largest MNEs, especially since 1985. The international scope of these MNEs is 
measured by the number of majority-owned foreign affiliates (subsidiaries) that they have. 
A similar picture emerges with later data. 
 As noted earlier, one of the characteristics of MNE afﬁ liates is that they are linked by a stra-
tegic plan. As a result, units that are geographically dispersed and/or have diverse product 
offerings all work in accord with a strategic vision. The formulation and implementation 
of strategy will be discussed in detail in  Chapter 8 . Here we will look at the basic nature of 
the strategic management process and how select MNEs use strategic planning in managing 
their far-ﬂ ung enterprises. 
  Strategic management of MNEs: an introduction 
 The strategic management process involves four major functions: strategy formulation, 
strategy implementation, evaluation, and the control of operations. These functions encom-
pass a wide range of activities, beginning with an environmental analysis of external and 
internal conditions and an evaluation of organizational strengths and weaknesses. These 
activities serve as the basis for a well-formulated strategic plan, and by carefully implement-
ing and controlling this plan, the MNE is able to compete effectively in the international 
arena.  Figure  2.3 illustrates the ﬁ ve speciﬁ c steps in this overall process. 
  Steps in the strategic management process 
 Strategic planning typically begins with a review of the company’s   basic mission , which 
is determined by answering the questions: What is the ﬁ rm’s business? What is its reason 
for existence? By answering these questions, the company clearly determines the direction 
in which it wants to go. Shell Oil, BP, and Chevron, for example, see themselves as being in

CHAPTER 2 THE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE
the energy business, not in the oil business, and this focus helps to direct their long-range 
thinking. AT&T and France Telecom view themselves as being in the communications busi-
ness, not in the telephone business. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo see themselves in the food busi-
ness, not in the soft drink business. One of their strategic rivals is Nestlé.    
 In recent years a growing number of MNEs have revised their strategic plans because 
they realized that they had drifted too far away from their basic mission. Unilever, the 
giant Anglo-Dutch MNE, is a good example. After assessing its operations, the company 
concluded that it needed to adopt a “back to the core” strategy. As a result, it sold a wide 
range of peripheral operations, including transport, oil, milling, wallpaper, floor cover-
ings, specialty chemicals, and turkey breeding. Today Unilever confines its business to 
consumer product goods: food, health and wellness products, personal care, and home 
care. The firm’s strong research and development labs continue to develop new products 
in each of these areas, thus helping Unilever to remain competitive in worldwide markets.       14 
 After determining its mission, an MNE will evaluate the external and internal environ-
ment. The goal of external environmental analysis is to identify opportunities and threats 
that will need to be addressed. Based on opportunity analysis, for example, a number of 
MNEs have been moving into the former East Germany. Adidas-Salomon now produces 
a large portion of its textiles in this part of Germany. Metro, a German retailer, now has a 
large presence in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Russia.       15  These companies all 
see the region as having tremendous financial potential. 
 However, these expansion decisions were made only after the companies had analyzed 
the potential pitfalls, and there were many of them. One is that East Germans lived in a 
centrally planned bureaucracy for almost a half-century. Could they adapt to a free market 
economy? Would they be able to accept individual responsibility in a country where the 
state was no longer the major provider? Would they be able to upgrade their inefficient 
factories and improve the quality of output? Many MNEs believed that, with an influx of 
capital, the country’s economy could be turned around. At the same time, their external 
environmental analysis showed that it would be necessary to increase worker productivity, 
improve the local infrastructure, and bring in qualified managers to run the operations 
until a local cadre could be developed. 
 The purpose of internal environmental analysis is to evaluate the company’s financial 
and personnel strengths and weaknesses. Examining its financial picture will help the MNE 
decide what it can afford to do in terms of expansion and capital investment. Examining 
its financial picture will also help it to identify areas where cost cutting or divestment is in 
order. By making an evaluation of its personnel, an MNE will be able to determine how 
well its current workforce can meet the challenges of the future and what types of people 
will have to be hired or let go. In addition, the firm might like to include in its internal 
environmental analysis the reputation of its products, the structure of its organization, and 
its relationship with suppliers. 
 Internal and external analyses will also help the MNE to identify both long-range goals 
(typically two to five years) and short-range goals (less than two years). The plan is then 
broken down into major parts, and each affiliate and department will be assigned goals and 
responsibilities. This begins the implementation process. Progress is then periodically 
evaluated and changes are made in the plan. For example, an MNE might realize that it 
must stop offering a particular good or service because the market is no longer profitable 
or it might create a new product in order to take advantage of an emerging demand.  Figure   2.3    
describes the strategic management process. External and internal environmental assess-
ments are discussed in more detail in  Chapter 8 . 
 The case  International Business Strategy in Action: Nestlé  provides an example of 
some aspects of the strategic management process.

  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Nestlé 
 With 230,000 employees, 6,000 brands, and factories 
spread around the world, Nestlé is the world’s largest food 
company. Nescafé instant coffee, Perrier water, and KitKat 
chocolate are just some of the products that the company 
produces and markets around the world. 
 A significant portion of Nestlé’s revenues derives from 
developing countries. In 2002, developing nations in Latin 
America, Africa, and the Middle East accounted for 33.7 per-
cent of all sales. Nestlé’s strategy in these nations consists 
of purchasing successful local brands, keeping their origi-
nal names, and adding its own brand. In Peru, for instance, 
the company purchased ice cream and chocolate maker 
D’Onofrio, and continued to market its products under 
the D’Onofrio brand, capitalizing on the reputation of this 
brand while adding the Nestlé logo as a parent brand to all 
packaging. Not a bad analogy to the entire Nestlé business 
where a “think local” philosophy is meshed together at the 
multinational level. 
 Entering Third World countries can be risky and unre-
warding. For one thing, there is a currency risk. During 
1998–2002, Nestlé’s volume sales in Brazil rose by 10 per-
cent but because of the devaluation of Brazil’s currency, 
revenues in Swiss francs fell by 30 percent. Products must 
be adapted to the local tastes. In China, red bean and 
sesame-flavored chocolate ice cream cubes are two of the 
more than 100 flavors of ice cream that Nestlé markets in 
China alone. Political risk, in terms of expropriation or war, 
is also higher in developing countries. 
 Dealings with Third World countries may also affect a 
company’s reputation in its large industrialized markets. 
In 2002, Nestlé demanded that the Ethiopian government 
deliver $6 million for a company that was expropriated 
in 1975 under a communist regime. Non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and concerned citizens were out-
raged. At the time, Ethiopia was undergoing a famine that 
threatened as many as 11 million citizens with starvation. 
The Ethiopian government offered $1 million, but Nestlé 
rejected the offer. Oxfam decried the company’s stance 
claiming that one of the richest companies in the world 
was trying to squeeze as much as it could from one of the 
poorest countries in the world. A spokesperson for the 
World Bank, which was brokering the deal, stated that the 
$1 million offer seemed reasonable and accused Nestlé of 
trying to get as much as it could. The backlash led Nestlé 
to accept $1.5 million in compensation and to donate the 
entire amount for famine relief in the country.

 Did Disney management conduct an external environmental analysis before 
going forward with Euro Disney? Explain. 
 The company conducted a thorough external environmental analysis. First, the location 
of the European population was examined to identify how far people would have to travel 
to visit the park. Second, the company examined the cost of building the park and identi-
fied potential sources of funds. Third, the firm determined how the park was to be built 
and where it would find the necessary contractors. Fourth, the company made a forecast 
regarding the number of visitors to the park each year, how much they would spend, and 
what the firm’s profit would be on the venture. 
 
 However, the company failed in its examination of the cultural preferences of 
Europeans and the relative competitiveness of its European operation against its North 
American operation. In particular, Disney failed to take into consideration the effect of 
exchange rates on the affordability of traveling to France as opposed to Florida to visit its 
amusement park. 
 Much of the material in this book can be synthesized within a single analytical framework.       16 
We develop this here to help summarize our key points. There are two basic building blocks 
in an international business course, as illustrated in  Figure   2.4   . First, there is a set of ﬁ rm-
speciﬁ c factors that determine the competitive advantage of an organization. We call these 
 ﬁ rm-speciﬁ c advantages (FSAs)  . An FSA is deﬁ ned as a unique capability proprietary to 
the organization. It may be built on product or process technology, marketing, or distribu-
tional skills. Second, there are country factors. These, of course, are unique to an inter-
national business course. They can lead to   country-speciﬁ c advantages (CSAs) . The CSAs 
can be based on natural resource endowments (minerals, energy, forests) or on the labor 
force and associated cultural factors.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Managers of most MNEs use strategies that build on the interactions of CSAs and FSAs. 
They do this so that they can be positioned in a unique strategic space. The CSAs represent 
the natural factor endowments of a nation; they are based on the key variables in its aggre-
gate production function. For example, CSAs can consist of the quantity, quality, and cost 
of the major factor endowment, namely resources. 
 Using Porter’s terminology, the CSAs form the basis of the global platform from 
which the multinational firm derives a home-base “diamond” advantage in global 
competition. 17  Tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and government regulation also 
influence CSAs. Building on these CSAs, the firm makes decisions about the efficient 
global configuration and coordination between segments of its value chain (operations, 
marketing, R&D, and logistics). The skill in making such decisions represents a strong, 
managerial FSA. 
 The FSAs possessed by a firm are based ultimately on its internalization of an asset, such 
as production knowledge, managerial or marketing capabilities, over which the firm has 
proprietary control. FSAs are thus related to the firm’s ability to coordinate the use of the 
advantage in production, marketing, or the customization of services. 
 The FSA–CSA matrix 
 To help formulate the strategic options of the MNE, it is useful to identify the relative 
strengths and weaknesses of the CSAs and FSAs they possess.  Figure   2.5   , the FSA–CSA 
matrix, provides a useful framework for discussion of these issues. The “strength” or “weak-
ness” of FSAs and CSAs is a relative notion, depending on the relevant market and the CSAs 
and FSAs of potential competitors. A strong FSA implies that, under identical CSAs, a ﬁ rm 
has a potential competitive advantage over its rivals. 
 Quadrants (or cells) 1, 2, and 3 correspond broadly to the three generic strategies 
suggested: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. 18  Quadrant 1 firms are generally 
resource based and/or mature, globally oriented firms producing a commodity-type 
product. Given their late stage in the product life cycle, production FSAs flowing from 
the possession of intangible skills are less important than the CSAs of location and energy 
 Figure 2.5  The FSA–CSA matrix 

51
CHAPTER 2 THE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE
costs, which are the main sources of the firm’s competitive advantage. Quadrant 2 firms 
represent inefficient, floundering firms with no consistent strategy, nor any intrinsic CSAs 
or FSAs. These firms are preparing to exit or to restructure. Quadrant 2 can also represent 
domestically based small and medium-sized firms with little global exposure. Quadrant 3 
firms generally can choose to follow any of the generic strategies listed above because of 
the strength of both their CSAs and FSAs.   
 Firms in quadrant 4 are generally differentiated firms with strong FSAs in marketing 
and customization. These firms follow basically a differentiation strategy. In quadrant 4 the 
FSAs dominate, so in world markets the home-country CSAs are not essential in the long 
run. Thus these firms are following low-cost and price competition strategies. 
 In terms of business strategy, quadrants 3 and 2 are unambiguous in their implications. 
A quadrant 3 firm can benefit from strategies of both low cost and differentiation. Such 
a firm is constantly evaluating its production mix. As a product line matures and then 
declines, it eventually graduates to quadrant 2. However, by adopting new product lines, 
developing dynamic organizational capabilities, and maintaining an effective strategy, the 
firm can maintain its overall position in quadrant 3. In quadrant 2 there is no alternative 
but to restructure or to eventually leave the market. 
 Quadrants 4 and 1 are credible positions for different types of firms. For instance, a 
quadrant 4 firm that has strong FSAs in marketing (customization) can operate globally 
without reliance on its home-market CSA, or the CSAs of the host nation. For such a firm, 
quadrant 4 does not signal a CSA weakness; the CSA is not relevant. In contrast, quadrant 1 
has mature multinationals or product lines determined more by CSAs than by FSAs. By 
improving potential FSAs in marketing or product innovation and increasing value added 
through vertical integration, the quadrant 1 firm can move to quadrant 3, where its profit-
ability should be enhanced. 
 Although quadrants 1, 3, and 4 represent appropriate strategic positioning for some 
firms, there exists an asymmetry between quadrants 4 and 1. A quadrant 4 strategic choice 
may be a stable one for some firms; however, quadrant 1 firms should be able to aim for 
quadrant 3. The reason for this asymmetry is rooted in the fact that CSAs are for the most 
part exogenous to the firm, whereas FSAs are not. Even to the extent that CSAs can be 
influenced by government protection, there is always increased uncertainty associated with 
such strategies. For the firm in quadrant 4 already following an efficiency-based strategy 
there is no incentive, nor need, to move to quadrant 3. 
 It is useful to note the following two points. First, if the firm has a conglomerate 
structure it would be more useful to situate each division or product line individually, 
recognizing that different units of the diversified firm would use different generic strat-
egies. Second, changes in the trading environment—such as the EU 1992 single-market 
measures, or the EU 1999 single currency, or the United States–Canada Free Trade 
Agreement and NAFTA—will affect the relative CSAs of the firms. To the extent that 
CSAs are improved, the firms will tend to move to quadrant 3, and, to the extent that 
the CSAs are hampered, the firm or some of its product lines may move to exit, as in 
quadrant 2. 
 For Dunning’s related OLI theoretical framework see  Appendix B  to  Chapter 2  ( Table   2A   ). 
  Figure   2.5    can be reconciled with the OLI framework of Dunning (1981). In this eclectic 
paradigm Dunning has location factors (L), internalization factors (I), and ownership fac-
tors (O). The location variable (L) is entirely consistent with the vertical axis of  Figure   2.5   . 
The CSAs can be relabeled as location-specific advantages (LSAs) in order to better link to 
the eclectic paradigm. Indeed, given the finding that many MNEs operate largely within 
their home region of the triad, which implies that national borders are less important than 
triad borders, it would make sense to replace CSAs by LSAs. The logic of the axis remains 
entirely the same. 

52
PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 The horizontal axis shows the unique capabilities of the firm called FSAs. There is little 
value in distinguishing between the O and I aspects of FSAs. Clearly property rights (O) 
need to be established to overcome market imperfections, especially in the pricing and pro-
tection of knowledge, and it is clear that imperfect markets trigger internalization (I) by an 
institution such as the MNE. Thus O and I, in practice, are integrated features of FSA man-
agement within the MNE that cannot be decoupled in strategic decision making. While 
in principle the conceptual analysis of MNE evolution can indeed distinguish between O, 
L, and I, the more reductionist focus on FSAs and CSAs/LSAs alone provides an equally 
powerful theoretical tool, whereby any observation of internalization/de-internalization 
can be explained on the basis of the nature of FSAs and CSAs/LSAs and the interactions 
between these two sets of parameters. 
 If MNEs are the key drivers of globalization and they operate regionally, why is it thought 
that globalization exists? For example, Thomas Friedman, the  New York Times journalist, 
has sold over 3 million copies of his  The World is Flat . 19  This is unfortunate since this 
book is based upon a faulty understanding of globalization, and it lacks any insight and 
balance into the underlying empirical context of world business. Basically, Friedman 
makes one point in his book, namely that today a large proportion of international busi-
ness take place through offshoring. Indeed, much manufacturing and cost innovation 
take place in China with ser vice sector activities, especially in information technology 
sectors, taking place in India. While both types of offshoring certainly exist (and are 
explained by factor cost arbitrage) it is apparent that Friedman vastly exaggerates the 
importance of offshoring in the IT-related area. 
 Friedman’s book largely consists of interesting and well-written anecdotes referring to 
this particular sector. But it is incorrect to generalize the country effect (the CSA axis in 
 Figure   2.5   ) and make it the sole explanation of globalization. Instead, the firm effects need 
to be analyzed across other sectors and the integration of firm and country effects needs to 
be brought together, as in quadrant 3 of  Figure   2.5   . It can be seen that Friedman’s book is 
mainly about quadrant 1, and that he presents no evidence of the way FSAs can be devel-
oped such that CSAs in China and India are transformed into quadrant 3 firm-specific 
attributes. 
 This analysis counters the simplistic notions of writers such as Thomas Friedman. The 
world is not flat. International business suggests that there remain strong barriers as a 
business attempts to cross the boundaries of triad regions. It is pointless to assume globaliz-
ation; instead, it is necessary to investigate the manner in which a firm’s business model 
may need to be adapted such that its FSAs can overcome the liability of inter-regional 
foreignness.

well known internationally in electronics manufacturing services (EMS), although the 
company’s name does not appear on any of its products. This is because Solectron is 
an outsourcer that generates its revenues by producing goods for other companies. 20 
Today Solectron runs a factory it bought from Sony and is able to provide the same 
type of electronic products to Sony at a lower cost than the giant Japanese ﬁ rm could 
do itself. Like many electronic companies that design, manufacture, and sell their own 
products, Sony’s return on investment has been shockingly low because of the large 
amount of capital that is tied up in its factories. In a typical year Sony’s return on equity 
is around 5 percent. In contrast, Solectron is able to earn a return on equity in the range 
of 12 percent. By focusing exclusively on such things as customized electronics tech-
nology, state-of-the-art manufacturing, and supply-chain assistance, Solectron is able 
to achieve economies of scale that allow it to produce and deliver goods both quickly 
and inexpensively. As a result, its customer list is extensive. Large ﬁ rms such as Cisco 
Systems, the giant Internet equipment company, rely on Solectron to handle a signiﬁ -
cant portion of their manufacturing needs. So too do smaller ﬁ rms such as Handspring 
Inc., a California-based company that competes in the palm-size organizer market. In 
Handspring’s case, the company realizes that its expertise is in designing and developing 
organizers as well as marketing them. As a result, it has turned over the production of 
these units to Solectron. 
 Today the cost of building new manufacturing plants is prohibitive for many firms. 
At the same time, the life cycle of products is becoming increasingly shorter. So if firms 
are going to reach their profit goals, they are going to have to find new ways to cut their 
expenses by outsourcing. (For more on contract manufacturing, see the Real Case: 
Flextronics, in  Chapter 12 .) 
 BMW 
 BMW is one of the world’s best-known auto ﬁ rms and for many years it has successfully 
produced and sold quality cars. As a result, the company has been able to capture and hold 
a solid share of the middle and upper-middle car market. In 2009, BMW has 56 percent of 
its sales in Europe and 25 percent in North America, where its cars and SUVs sell well in 
the upper end of the market. More recently, however, BMW has been turning its attention 
to the lower end of the market. One of its new objectives is to produce a small BMW and 
sell it at a premium price. This car line, which has been dubbed the 2 Series by the press, hit 
the market in 2004. 21 
 Will BMW be successful in this venture? Some observers are quick to point out 
that small cars are a tempting but dangerous segment of the market. Profits are often 
elusive and competition is fierce. One of the big questions that is yet to be answered is 
how much of a premium buyers will be willing to pay for a small BMW. The company 
believes that there are customers who will pay a premium for value-added features 
and high performance. One of the features in the 2 Series will be rear-wheel drive, 
not the front-wheel drive that is common in most small cars. While front-wheel drive 
offers better fuel economy, BMW believes that rear-wheel drive will provide better 
handling and give the driver a better feel for the road. In addition, the company 
intends to give the 2 Series the same distinctive exterior look as its larger cars. As a 
result of these types of features, BMW feels that it will be able to attract buyers who 
are willing to pay a premium. In addition, the company is convinced that its name 
and reputation for quality will help it garner market share. In the past the firm has 
done exceptionally well and has consistently been one of the most profitable car makers 
in the world. However, this success has been in the upscale market. Making money

in the small-car market while charging a premium price is going to be an interesting 
challenge for it.  
 Levi Strauss 
 Bruce Springsteen wore a pair of Levi’s jeans on the cover of his  Born in the USA album, 
and James Dean and Madonna also did their part in marketing the brand. Levi’s success at 
inﬁ ltrating itself into US pop culture is such that it pops up in the memory of many baby 
boomers remembering their school years: The “cool” kids wore Levi’s. 
 In the mid-nineteenth century denim was considered work wear, and Levi Strauss & Co. 
was a small dry goods store that sold functional items like clothing, linens, and bedding 
in California. Marketing of Levi’s denim products borrowed from the American Western 
landscape featuring cowboys, fishermen, and mechanics, among others, at work in every-
thing from their catalogues to the garment’s tag. Durable, functional, and guaranteed were 
the pillars on which the firm built the reputation of its products. 
 By the start of the twentieth century, the firm had expanded its product line to include 
children’s clothing. At the same time, the firm’s marketing became more “artistic,” taking 
on the cultural trends of the times and marking a significant shift in philosophy that would 
turn the brand into a US icon and make jeans a fashion statement. 
 Being a US tradition, however, has not been enough to spare the firm from the chal-
lenges facing the industry around the world. Over the past two decades the firm has under-
performed as a result of increased competition and changing consumer trends around the 
world. Protecting the brand name it so painstakingly built might never have been such a 
difficult task. 
 Levi Strauss was one of the last firms to hold on to domestic manufacturing. After all, 
the value of the brand was closely tied to US manufacturing quality. As competitors flocked 
to Asia in the mid-1990s, the firm remained hopeful that its brand would survive the price 
competition. By 1999, the strategy shifted as Levi Strauss announced it would turn itself 
into a marketing firm and shed the manufacturing side of its supply chain. This, it argued, 
would allow the firm to have a more flexible price structure. By 2004, all US-based factories 
had been closed. 22 
 Diesel, Guess, Buffalo, Silver, and Gap have also eroded the star power of Levi’s jeans. 
Diesel jeans, for example, are considered a step above in terms of quality and design. 
While some competing brands might not be as durable as Levi’s, they are less traditional 
in design, accommodating the ever-changing tastes of consumers who seasonally update 
their wardrobes. 
 In England, Levi Strauss went as far as suing Tesco, a major supermarket, for selling 
Levi’s products at a discounted price. Levi Strauss argued that Tesco’s actions devalued the 
brand by selling jeans next to household products, groceries, and produce. Tesco had pur-
chased Levi’s jeans in the gray market—from distributors whose products originated from 
Levi’s, because it refused to sell jeans directly to Tesco or other supermarkets. A European 
Union law prohibits branded products purchased abroad from being sold in the EU mar-
ket without the consent of the brand owner. The ruling forbade Tesco from purchasing 
products outside the EU for sale in the UK, but allowed it to continue purchasing jeans in 
other EU countries.       23 
 Winning the lawsuit did little to solve the erosion of its market by competitors, and the 
company continued to make losses. Realizing the potential of using these “discount” mar-
keting channels, Levi Strauss introduced a cheaper version of its jeans to be sold directly 
to supermarkets, including Tesco. Levi’s “Signature” brand may solve the firm’s problem 
of attracting as wide a customer base as possible while retaining the value of its original 
line of jeans. 24 

55
CHAPTER 2 THE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE
 Levi Strauss is one of the few companies that pulled out of China during the mid-1990s 
because it felt that the government was guilty of pervasive human rights violations. The 
company stopped manufacturing jeans in China after it found evidence of child labor, 
forced labor, and a military presence at factories that were producing clothing for the 
firm. The company did not own any of these factories on the mainland; it relied on local 
subcontractors to perform the manufacturing. However, company guidelines prohibited 
the suppliers from using child labor, forced labor, or excessive work hours. So when Levi 
Strauss learned of these violations, it concluded that its association with the contractors 
would damage its reputation, and it began a phased withdrawal from China. 
 Now Levi Strauss is coming back into the marketplace and even has plans to start a 
direct-marketing operation on the mainland. The firm has promised to monitor its new 
Chinese factories carefully to ensure that they comply with human rights guidelines. At 
the same time, however, Levi Strauss is glad to be back because, like many other MNEs, the 
company believes that China is a marketplace of the future.       25  One senior executive in the 
company put it this way: “You’re nowhere in Asia without being in China.”  
 Canon 
 Canon is one of the world’s leading camera and printer ﬁ rms, but this has not always been 
true. For many years Canon followed the leaders and worked to improve its technology. 
However, in recent years the company has taken the lead against ﬁ rms such as Leica in cam-
eras and Xerox in photocopiers. 26  It is a “global” ﬁ rm with 27.1 percent of its sales in North 
America, 41.0 percent in Asia, and 30.9 percent in Europe in 2009. 27 
 Today Canon is in the top three in all of its major business lines, and its original prod-
uct, cameras, now accounts for less than 10 percent of sales. However, the firm is the world 
leader in both single-lens reflexes and compacts, and earns almost one-third of its income 
from copiers. And to maintain its momentum, Canon has adopted a two-pronged strategy. 
First, it is seeking to maintain profits by cutting costs in its core business by making sup-
pliers more efficient and by shifting work to factories in Taiwan, in order to reduce the 
high cost of building some of its products in Japan. 
 Second, Canon is moving into the digital age by cultivating alliances with companies 
that know the networking and computer world better than it does. For example, Canon 
has teamed with Hewlett-Packard, one of its major competitors, to build laser printers. 
The company is also looking into developing smart printers with personal-computer-like 
abilities, including electronic mail, and printers that produce high-quality photo prints 
on plain paper. Quite clearly, Canon believes that its future rests with the continued 
development of innovative products that draw on its core competencies in the optical 
field.  
 Zara 
 Zara is the world’s fastest-growing fashion retailer. Its ultimate parent is Inditex S.A. 
Headquartered in north-western Spain, the company has expanded rapidly in recent 
years. 28  There are only a few Zara units in the United States, but the company’s plans call 
for a rapid expansion there too. 
 There are two things that make Zara’s implementation of its strategic plan so successful. 
One is that the company has created a lightning-speed production and distribution system. 
In an industry where competitors have their goods produced as much as five months in 
advance of delivery to stores, Zara’s turnaround time is a mere three weeks. This means 
that the company can alter its designs and create new ones as the season moves along, thus 
allowing it to continually accommodate the changing tastes of its customers. Moreover, 

56
PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
because Zara can change designs so quickly, none of its styles last more than four weeks. 
Coupled with this flexibility is a computerized inventory system that helps the firm 
minimize warehousing costs. Clothes are sorted in a single distribution center and then 
shipped out in preprogrammed lots directly to the stores. Twice a week each store receives 
deliveries that have been triggered by real-time inventory data that are collected through a 
network of computer handsets that feed information through the Internet into computers 
at headquarters. This system is so sophisticated and accurate that the company’s inventory 
level is a mere 7 percent of annual revenues, sharply lower than the 13 percent of its main 
competitor. 
 The other factor that helps account for the firm’s success in implementing its plan is the 
salespeople who act as grassroots market researchers. Each person has a wireless organizer 
that is used to enter trends, customer comments, and orders. As a result, if an item does 
not sell well, it can be off the shelf within weeks. Conversely, if it is successful, company 
designers can quickly learn this and turn out a new version in a myriad of colors in record 
time. As an example, when Zara store personnel sold pink dress shirts for men, they 
learned from the customers that they would have preferred purple. This information was 
conveyed to the company’s in-house manufacturing team, which raced into action. Within 
two weeks Zara stores were selling purple shirts. 
 The company implements the same basic strategy worldwide. It does no advertising, 
and the products that it sells in Europe are similar to those in its stores in the United States. 
Inventory control is also given a strong emphasis with all US stores supplied by air from 
Spain. At the same time, however, Zara does try to create an image that fits local taste. 
For example, in one of its mid-Manhattan stores the company tore out the entire interior 
and put in marble-like floors and high-tech lights to create a stunning 10,000 ft 2  (900 m 2 ) 
emporium. Customers, most of whom are in their 20s, are attracted by the feeling of being 
in an upscale European boutique, even though the prices are sharply lower and are targeted 
to compete with those at Gap. 29 
 Zara has been very effective in implementing its strategic plan as seen by the financial 
results. In an industry that has been seeing sluggish growth, Zara’s sales have been rising 
by over 20 percent annually up to 2008, growing at 15.8 percent in 2009 in the context of 
economic slowdown. As a result the company is now increasing the number of stores in 
Europe, North America, and Asia, using the same basic approach for implementation that 
has proven successful thus far. 
 These examples of large MNEs sometimes give the misleading impression that MNEs 
are larger than some countries. This mistake is compounded by the simple listing of the 
sales of MNEs against the GDP of nations (see  Table   2.3   ). In such a listing Wal-Mart 
appears 25th in the list and it is larger than Austria. Altogether there are 45 MNEs in the 
top 50. There are two problems with this. 
 First, even the sales of GM at $104.589 billion are tiny in comparison to the size of the 
US GDP at $14.14 trillion (2009 estimate). Similarly, the European MNEs are small com-
pared to the EU size (which is not recognized in  Table   2.3   —as the individual 15 members 
are included—but was estimated at more than $26 trillion in 2009 (Eurostat). And the 
largest Japanese MNE, Toyota, at $204.106 billion is tiny compared to the GDP of Japan 
at $4,149 trillion. 30 
 Second, the measures are biased against the countries. The GDP is a “value-added” 
concept. It considers the final sales of goods and services. To develop a comparable 
measure for MNEs requires that only their value added be calculated, not the total sales. 
If this is done, then the “size” of the MNEs is reduced by 70–80 percent. For example, 
in 2000, the value added of GM was only $46.2 billion, not the $176.6 billion reported 
as revenues. 31

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 1   A multinational enterprise is a company that is headquartered in one country but has 
operations in two or more countries. There is a series of characteristics that are common 
to multinational enterprises. These include (a) affiliated firms that are linked by ties of 
common ownership, (b) a common pool of resources, and (c) a strategic vision that 
guides all the affiliates.  
 2   Multinationals, especially large industrial enterprises, account for a large percentage 
of world sales and employment. MNEs, large or small, also engage in a wide variety of 
business activities ranging from manufacturing to retailing to consulting services.  
 3   The internationalization process is one of going abroad at incremental stages, on the 
premise that foreign markets are risky. Thus, a typical process is: license, export, sales 
office, and, finally, FDI.  
 4   Companies become MNEs for a number of reasons, including (a) a desire to protect 
themselves from the risks and uncertainties of the domestic business cycle, (b) a grow-
ing world market for their goods or services, (c) a response to increased foreign compe-
tition, (d) a desire to internalize in order to reduce costs, (e) a desire to overcome tariff 
barriers, and (f) the chance to take advantage of technological expertise by manufactur-
ing goods directly rather than allowing others to do it under a license agreement.  
 5   MNEs do not see themselves as an extension of their domestic roots. They hire, fire, 
and transfer personnel to meet global needs, even if this means laying off home-country 
employees. They also combine their talents with those of other MNEs in creating, 
financing, and managing joint ventures.  
 6   Successful MNEs rely on the strategic management process, which has five major 
phases: (a) identification of the firm’s basic mission, (b) external and internal environ-
mental analysis, (c) formulation of objectives and overall plans, (d) implementation of 
these plans, and (e) evaluation and control of operations.  
 7   Managers of most MNEs use strategies that build on firm-specific advantages (FSAs) 
and country-specific advantages (CSAs). CSAs are natural factor endowments of a 
nation. FSAs are based on the firm’s internalization of an asset.  
 8   The key concepts in this book can be brought together in the framework of the 
CSA–FSA matrix. The MNEs have FSAs that can be related to home and host CSAs.

 REAL CASE 
 Starbucks 
 From its first location in Seattle’s Pike Place Market in 
1971, Starbucks has grown into one of the largest coffee 
chains with 16,635 locations in markets across the world 
in 2009. The company purchases and roasts high-quality 
coffee beans that are then brewed and retailed in trendy 
designer coffee shops that cater to a loyal following of 
young urban professionals who appreciate the distinct 
taste of Starbucks’ coffee. In 2009 its sales were US $9.774 
billion, about two-third the size needed to be in the top 500 
world firms. 
 The company’s road to success began in 1985, when, 
after convincing the founders of Starbucks to test the coffee 
bar concept, the then director of retail operations, Howard 
Schultz, started his own coffee house to sell Starbucks 
coffee under the name Il Giornale. Within two years, 
Schultz purchased Starbucks and changed its company 
name to Starbucks Corporation. Since then, the company 
has expanded rapidly, opening stores in key markets and 
creating a “corporate coffee culture” in each of the urban 
areas in which it settled. Coffee bars are located in high-
traffic areas and include large bookstores, suburban malls, 
universities, and high-traffic intra-urban communities. 
 Popularity has not come without a price for Starbucks. 
Coffee prices fell considerably in the late 1990s and led 
to the displacement of thousands of farmers. The main 
reason for a fall in the price of coffee was the oversup-
ply that arose from improved production techniques and 
from a crop boom in the 1990s. Although Starbucks only 
purchases approximately 1 percent of the global supply of 
coffee, its high profile has made it a main target for protes-
tors who accuse the coffee giant of not providing a fair price 
to coffee growers; this, despite Starbucks’ policy of pur-
chasing high-quality beans at premium market prices. To 
address the concerns of protestors, Starbucks introduced 
Fairtrade-endorsed coffee to its coffee houses. While the 
amount of Fairtrade coffee sold by the company is insig-
nificant, at 1 percent of total sales, it is enough to portray 
the company as progressive and avert a consumer boycott.   
 The company directly operates 6,764 coffee houses in 
the United States in 2009. Unlike many coffee and fast-food 
chains, Starbucks does not franchise (license the right to 
operate one of its stores) to individuals in the United States. 
It does, however, negotiate licensing agreements with com-
panies that have control over valuable retail space, such as 
an airport or hospital. In 2009, there were 4,364 Starbucks 
stores operating under licenses. 
 With coffee houses in 40 countries, today Starbucks has 
a global presence. In contrast to its domestic operations, 
the vast majority of Starbucks’ international operations are 
through licenses. Indeed, of 5,507 international stores in 
2009, 3,439 were licensed and in joint venture. 
 Starbucks might have operations in far-away countries 
like Australia, Oman, and China, but it is not global in its 
scope of operations. In 2009, 85.36 percent of its stores

were located in its home region of North America, includ-
ing operations in Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. An 
even larger portion of Starbucks’ revenues and operat-
ing income are home-region oriented. The United States 
alone accounts for 79.7 percent of revenues and 99 percent 
of operating income. International operations, including 
those that are directly owned and operated by Starbucks, 
require a higher degree of administrative support to be 
responsive to country-specific regulatory requirements. 
In addition, because these are mainly new markets, econ-
omies of scale in marketing and production have not yet 
materialized.

 1 Why does Starbucks rely on licenses for most of 
its international operations? Does the firm risk 
the dissipation of its managerial or technological 
advantages?   
 2 Can you argue that Starbucks is a global company 
regardless of the strong dominance of its home 
region in terms of sales and locations? Explain.   
 3 What accounts for the discrepancy between 
percentage of foreign locations and percentage of 
foreign net revenues?   
 4 What are some of the reasons why Starbucks 
chooses to retain operational control of its domestic 
operations? 
 Sony 
 Very few companies can claim to be globally successful, 
but Sony, which brought us the Walkman and co-developed 
the CD and the DVD, has the numbers to prove it. In 2009, 
the company’s $76.361 billion in revenues were evenly 
distributed across mainly three markets: Japan, the United 
States, and Europe. 
 Headquartered in Japan, Sony is best known for its high-
quality consumer electronics, which account for 61 percent 
of total revenues, but the firm also produces games, music, 
and pictures. Consumers might not own a Sony electronic 
system, but the movie they watched last night or the CD 
they listen to while jogging may be the intellectual property 
of a Sony company. Sony’s strategy boils down to produc-
ing electrical gadgets and controlling the content that 
goes through them much in the same way as its successful 
PlayStation 2 game console provides the hardware necess-
ary for the firm to capture the games market. 
 In the 1980s, Sony’s Betamax lost the VCR war to 
JVC’s VHS. Both systems had been developed in the mid-
1970s and initially Sony’s Betamax was the clear winner. 
Indeed, all movies were originally released in Betamax 
format. General wisdom argues that Betamax lost the 
VCR war because it failed to license its software to rival 
manufacturers while Matsushita licensed to all. Today, the 
Betamax–VHS battle is often cited to argue the benefits of 
licensing new technology. 
 Yet, how could Sony have been so reckless as to ignore 
the benefits of licensing? The answer is that it did not. In 
1974, a year before the Betamax release, Sony approached 
JVC and Matsushita seeking to reach an agreement on 
standards for the new product. In doing so, it freely dis-
closed Betamax’s patented specification and technology 
to its rivals. The VHS format developed by JVC used very 
similar technology, but, because of its different size, was 
incompatible with Betamax. Matsushita was asked to 
choose between Sony’s and JVC’s product. Its decision 
came down to cost. It was cheaper to produce the VHS 
format because it had fewer components. With this, the 
players for the market were defined. The Betamax was to 
be manufactured by Toshiba, Sanyo Electric, NEC, Aiwa, and 
Pioneer. Matsushita, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric, Sharp, and 
Akai Electric manufactured JVC’s VHS. 
 Perhaps more important than the size of the VCR disks of 
the two formats was that the VHS format allowed record-
ing for two hours, twice that of Betamax. This would have 
allowed consumers to record an entire movie while away 
for the night. Sony was close to integrating technology into 
its format that would have increased the recording time 
to that of the VHS. If this was what tilted the balance, then 
all Sony would have needed is a bit of time. Potentially, 
at least, it could have bought itself some time if it owned 
the rights of the movies and refused to release them in 
 REAL CASE

CHAPTER 2 THE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE
anything but Betamax format. And so it is that Sony’s lat-
est technological bets, the CD and DVD, have Sony Music 
Entertainment Inc. and Sony Pictures Entertainment to 
back them up. 
 In today’s market, however, this type of vertical inte-
gration can hamper the ability of the consumer electronics 
division to develop the products that consumers want. 
Practically every major development in the consumer elec-
tronics industry in recent years has been developed by, or 
with the help of, Sony. Yet, very recently, Apple introduced 
the iPod, a very small and light device that can store up to 
10,000 music files. The iPod is based on a small hard drive 
equipped with an audio function. Since similar memory 
cards are available across product lines in the industry and 
no other firm has Sony’s reputation in the audio market, 
why, then, did Sony not come up with its own version? One 
argument is that the conglomerate must now weigh the 
benefits of developing a product in one division that may 
increase piracy of its music in another division. 
 If that is so, Sony is walking a fine line. Its electronics 
branch has ceased to produce stand-alone products and 
is instead integrating new products with others, which is 
likely to make piracy even easier than it is now. Soon, Sony 
hopes, your computer will be able to communicate with 
your television, stereo, and DVD player wirelessly, creating 
an integrated network of consumer electronics. And, if it 
all goes according to plan, Sony’s media content will flow 
within these networks.   
 With PlayStation 2, Sony’s dominance in the market for 
games was assured, at least in the short term, because it 
managed to capture most of the market and a games con-
sole creates a barrier to other game marketers because 
of lack of compatibility and intellectual property owned by 
the firm. Other forms of entertainment, however, are not 
as easily monopolized. Indeed, most new products, like the 
iPod, are based on technology that is standardized or can 
be adapted to work with that of competitors. If products do 
not do this, they might suffer the fate of the Betamax.

 1 Is Sony a multinational enterprise?   
 2 If the vast majority of Sony’s consumer electronics 
business is based and developed in Japan and the 
vast majority of Sony’s music and movie business 
is based in the United States, does Sony make 
decisions that are best for the entire company 
regardless of location?   
 3 Why does Sony need to license its technology to 
competitors?

 In this chapter we developed the CSA–FSA framework for the study of international busi-
ness. Here we examine a related approach to the study of the reasons behind the invest-
ments made by MNEs. The “eclectic” approach, ﬁ rst developed by John Dunning, provides 
a consolidation of the literature on FDI that draws on industrial organization theories, 
location theory, and market imperfections approaches. 
  Dunning’s “eclectic” theory of MNEs 
 The eclectic theory speciﬁ es a set of three conditions that must be met if a ﬁ rm is to engage 
in foreign operations: ﬁ rm-speciﬁ c advantages (FSAs), internalization advantages, and 
country-speciﬁ c advantages (CSAs). (See  Table  2E .) 
  Firm-specific (ownership-specific) advantages (FSAs) 
 The firm must possess net ownership advantages vis-à-vis firms of other nationalities 
in serving particular (and, in practice, mainly foreign) markets. These firm-specific 
 APPENDIX B TO  CHAPTER 2

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
(or  ownership) advantages largely take the form of the possession of intangible assets, 
which are, at least for a period of time, exclusive or specific to the firm possessing 
them.    
 Internalization advantages 
 A ﬁ rm possessing an advantage can either use the advantage itself (internalize it) or sell or 
lease the advantage to other ﬁ rms. This choice is usually explained in the context of trans-
actions costs and internalization theory (Rugman 1981). There are costs involved in use 
of markets and in internal coordination and control. The FDI decision depends on which 
option presents the best net return (revenue minus cost), when the risks associated with 
each alternative are taken into account. According to internalization theory, both natural 
and unnatural market imperfections induce internalization by MNEs. The ﬁ rm must con-
sider not only government-imposed regulations, but also natural barriers and other trans-
action costs such as the creation of buyer uncertainty. 
 Assuming that a firm possesses unique ownership advantages, if it is to engage in FDI 
it must be more beneficial for it to internalize its FSA, for example, to secure property 
rights over its FSAs in knowledge, rather than to sell or lease them to foreign firms. This 
internalization is done through an extension of its own activities rather than by external-
izing them through contacts at arm’s-length prices (which, in any case, may not exist) with 
independent firms. The management of the firm must judge that alternatives to internaliz-
ation such as licensing, management contracts, franchises, technical service agreements, 
turnkey projects, and subcontracts are either not feasible or the most profitable method of 
appropriating its FSAs. 
  Country-specific (location-specific) advantages (CSAs) 
 Assuming that the conditions stated in the two preceding sections are satisﬁ ed, if FDI is 
to take place it must be proﬁ table for the enterprise to locate abroad, that is, to utilize 
these FSAs in conjunction with at least some factor inputs (including natural resources) 
outside its home country. Otherwise foreign markets would be served entirely by exports 
and home markets by domestic production. Therefore, the location-speciﬁ c advan-
tages of the MNE are important elements in its choice of modality for servicing foreign 
markets.

CHAPTER 2 THE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE
  Relevance of the Dunning model 
 The net ownership, or ﬁ rm-speciﬁ c, advantages are required to offset the costs incurred 
by the MNE of operating at a distance from its home base. In the literature on the MNE, 
these costs are referred to, following Williamson (1975), as transaction costs. Transaction 
costs arise from the difﬁ culties of communicating over large distances and of controlling 
many subsidiaries. Both factors come into play once production decisions are made across 
national boundaries. In contrast, these costs of operating internationally are not incurred 
by a local ﬁ rm. The MNE must possess advantages that offset the disadvantages (additional 
costs) incurred in operating transnationally. If assets corresponding to those conferring the 
advantages to the MNE were available to local host-country ﬁ rms, the MNE would not be 
able to compensate for the transaction costs of operating at a distance. 
 The use of the advantage in the host country is required if FDI is to take place. The 
cost of moving resources used in the host country must exceed the costs of controlling a 
subsidiary at a distance plus the costs of trade. Otherwise, the resource would be exported 
or moved to the home country, production would take place in the home country, and the 
foreign-country market would be served by exports.  
 Sources of FSAs 
 The range of advantages that can lead to FDI is large but can be summarized as follows: 
 1  Proprietary technology due to research and development activities. 
 2   Managerial, marketing, or other skills specific to the organizational function of the firm.  
 3  Product differentiation, trademarks, or brand names. 
 4  Large size, reflecting scale economies. 
 5  Large capital requirements for plants of the minimum efficient size. 
  Sources of internalization advantages 
 The conditions that favor internalization include: 
 1  The high costs of making and enforcing contracts. 
 2  Buyer uncertainty about the value of the technology being sold. 
 3  A need to control the use or resale of the product. 
 4  Advantages to using price discrimination or cross-subsidization. 
 Sources of CSAs 
 The location-speciﬁ c advantages of the host country can include: 
 1  Natural resources. 
 2  Efficient and skilled, relatively low-cost labor force. 
 3  Trade barriers restricting imports. 
 The first and second of these CSAs can result in FDI that leads to exports as well as to 
production for the local market. The third CSA will be associated with production for the 
local market only. 
 Tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, the country’s competitive environment, and 
government regulations also influence CSAs. Building on these CSAs, the firm makes 

70
PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
decisions about the efficient international configuration and coordination between seg-
ments of its value chain (operations, marketing, R&D, and logistics). The skill in making 
such organizational decisions represents a strong, managerial firm-specific asset in itself. 
 In a perfect market situation, free trade would be the most efficient means of servicing 
markets abroad; however, given the many barriers to trade presently affecting the market, 
MNEs are a necessary alternative. The ability of MNEs to create internal markets enables 
them to bypass the barriers to trade that governments often erect. 
 Managers and most MNEs use strategies that build on the interactions of CSAs and 
FSAs. They do this to position themselves in a unique strategic space. In Porter’s ter-
minology, the CSAs form the basis of the global platform from which the multinational 
firm derives a home-base “diamond” advantage of global competitiveness. The Porter 
“ diamond” was discussed in  Chapter 1 under “Maintaining economic competitiveness.”

  Objectives of the chapter 
 As we noted in  Chapter 1 , a small number of economies account for 
a large portion of international investment and international trade. 
These triad economies—the United States, the EU15, and Japan—
are referred to collectively as the core triad. In this chapter we are 
going to look more closely at the “broad” triad of North America, 
Europe, and Asia and examine the role and impact of these regions 
on international business activity. We will also consider their role 
in both trade and FDI, and look at examples of how each member 
of the triad pursues target markets in other triad countries. We 
will also examine some of the economic and political relationships 
that exist between triad members and how these can have an 
impact on the international business community. We will also link 
to future chapters, such as  Chapters 8  and  9 , dealing with strategy 
and structure, respectively. In this context, we develop reasons for 
the need for MNEs to develop regional/triad strategies rather than 
“global” strategies. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Describe  the major reasons for FDI.  
 2  Explain  the role of triad-based MNEs in worldwide FDI and trade.  
 3  Relate  select examples of inter-triad MNE business activity.  
 4  Discuss  the economic interrelationships among triad members.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 In 1970 a European consortium consisting of Germany, 
France, and the UK (Spain later became a member) cre-
ated Airbus Industrie. The objective of the consortium was 
to build commercial aircraft with Germany, the UK, and 
Spain taking on the job of constructing the aircraft and 
France assuming responsibility for assembling it. The logic 
of the arrangement was fairly straightforward. Given the 
growth of international travel, there would be a continual 
need for new commercial aircraft, and Airbus wanted to be 
a major player in this industry. 
 Until this time, when major air carriers such as American 
Airlines, Japan Airlines, and Lufthansa needed to replace 
aging aircraft or increase the size of their fleet, they turned 
to Boeing or McDonnell Douglas, the two giant US aircraft 
manufacturers. Cargo carriers such as FedEx and DHL 
also bought aircraft from them, and, as international air 
shipments continued to grow rapidly, the annual demand 
proved to be a boon for Boeing and McDonnell. 
 The initial challenge for Airbus was to capture some 
market share and thus establish a toehold in the industry. 
This, fortunately, was not a problem. The consortium had 
divided up the responsibility for building the aircraft among 
its members. In this way, each country was guaranteed 
some of the work and, in turn, could count on its respective 
government to provide financial assistance and contracts. 
In particular, the consortium would have to spend large 
amounts of money for research and development in order 
to build competitive, state-of-the-art craft, but by getting 
support from their respective governments a great deal of 
the initial risk would be eliminated. This, by the way, was 
the same approach that had been used in the United States 
and helped account for much of Boeing’s and McDonnell’s 
success in building large aircraft. For example, much of the 
funding to build the giant C-5A cargo plane was provided by 
the US military. Then, by using this same technology, it was 
possible for Boeing to build its giant passenger aircraft. 
 Realizing that the consortium would eventually be able 
to build competitive craft, Boeing and McDonnell lodged 
complaints with the US government claiming that Airbus 
was being subsidized by its governments, and Washington 
needed to take steps to protect the US commercial air-
craft manufacturing industry. As the governments on both 
sides met to talk and discuss these issues, Airbus started 
building aircraft. It took quite a while, but by 1990 the 
consortium not only was becoming well established but 
had back orders for 1,100 aircraft and by 1997 this number 
had reached 2,300. In the process Airbus captured over 
30 percent of the world market. One of the major reasons 
for its success was that it focused on building fuel-efficient 
craft at competitive prices. Its wide-body, medium-range 
models, the A300 and A310, for example, were very reli-
able and the orders started flowing in from a wide number 
of buyers including large US carriers such as American 
Airlines and Northwest. During the 1990s the battle in the 
aircraft market also saw Boeing and McDonnell Douglas 
merge their operations. McDonnell could not compete 
effectively in this new, highly competitive market, but when 
merged with Boeing it could provide the latter with a good 
chance to prevent Airbus from steamrolling the US aircraft 
manufacturing industry. 
 By 2001 Airbus was doing better than ever. Not only had 
it managed to catch up with Boeing and hold 50 percent of 
the overall market, but it was in the throes of making major 
decisions that could result in its becoming the dominant 
player in the industry. The company had decided to build a 
giant, double-decker superjumbo jet. Known as the A380, 
this aircraft is capable of carrying 555 passengers, and the 
first craft made its first commercial flight in 2007. A host 
of buyers signed firm orders with the company, including 
Qantas, which ordered 12 of the craft, Singapore Airlines, 
and Air France, which each placed orders for 10. In 
 addition Singapore Airlines took an option for 15 more. The 
Singapore deal alone was worth over $8 billion to Airbus, 
showing how lucrative the market for a superjumbo jet 
could be. By 2010, other A380 users are Lufthansa and 
Emirates. However, the engine explosion on one of Qantas’ 
A380 on November 4, 2010 sparked a safety review, in what 
was considered to be the most serious safety incident yet 
for the superjumbo in its three years of operation. The 
plane experienced midair explosion shortly after taking 
off. The pilots of the flight made a successful emergency 
 landing in Singapore. The aircraft have undergone inten-
sive work before they were resumed to fly three weeks 
later. The decision to restore A380 services followed an 
intensive Trent 900 engine inspection program carried 
out in close consultation with Rolls Royce and Airbus. 
Modifications have been made to the Rolls Royce engines 
used on 20 A380s by three airlines—Qantas, Lufthansa, and 
Singapore Airlines.  
 In response to Airbus’s A380 aircraft, Boeing announced 
that it was going to build a smaller, faster, longer-range 
plane that would fly just below the speed of sound. Quite 
clearly the two competitors were moving in different 
directions. 
 ACTIVE LEARNING CASE 
 Boeing versus Airbus 

73
CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Airbus was betting more than $12 billion that airlines 
will want a superjumbo jet that can carry a large number 
of passengers on long trips to a given region. Boeing was 
betting that there is a much larger demand for smaller, 
faster planes that can take people directly to their desti-
nation. In doing so, Boeing has ceded to Airbus a highly 
profitable jumbo market, wagering that the European 
group will not earn back its huge investment but rather 
end up stumbling badly. Boeing’s decision to abandon 
the development of a larger plane (similar to what Airbus 
proposed) relied heavily on follow-on studies of the giant 
747. The company’s engineers concluded that, except in 
the case of a huge 800-passenger plane, a double-decker 
design had to be scaled back to a single decker to satisfy 
technical and safety standards. One reason, according to 
Boeing engineers, is because a double-decker arrange-
ment is very inefficient. Another is that, in case of evacu-
ation, a two-level aircraft can present major problems for 
those on board. 
 At this same time Airbus announced that its consortium 
arrangement was coming to an end and that the company 
would now be managed as a corporation. This move effec-
tively ended Airbus’s life as an organization that operated 
in the world of business and politics and one in which each 
partner held a veto, politically motivated committees made 
many of the important decisions, and when things did not 
go well state funds could be counted on to prop up the 
consortium. Now, with all of that behind it, Airbus worked 
to streamline its operations and, according to the business 
partners, shave off about $400 million in annual expenses. 
 Will Airbus continue to dominate the airways? Its initial 
challenge was to build the A380 superjumbo. If the demand 
for the huge craft does materialize, Boeing may find itself 
as a minor player in the industry. On the other hand, while 
in late 2001 Airbus recruited thousands of new workers to 
help with the project, it had trouble finding partners to help 
fund the venture. A number of European suppliers signed 
up but US and Japanese companies did not. For example, 
Airbus had offered Japanese manufacturers up to 8 per-
cent of the work on the A380 in return for funding but had 
no takers. The company also wanted to get US firms to 
invest and thus defuse a potential political problem that 
could result in the US government making it difficult for 
Airbus to do business in the United States. When Airbus 
first got started, it relied heavily on governmental support. 
Now that it was very successful, it no longer needed this 
type of help. However, the US government was unlikely 
to sit by and let this company dominate the industry while 
Boeing might be forced to take a back seat. In a way, the 
situation is similar to that in 1970 when Airbus first got 
started—the main difference is that the two companies 
now seem to be in opposite positions.  
 The US and EU have been involved in a long dispute on 
subsidies for Boeing and Airbus. In 2004, the US lodged 
a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 
2010, the WTO ruled  that the EU paid illegal subsidies 
to Airbus. EU governments were found to have unfairly 
financed Airbus through risk free loans, research and 
infrastructure funding. But the WTO did not uphold all of 
the US complaints. However, the EU rejected the US claim 
that state support had materially impacted the sector and 
challenged the WTO ruling.  The EU said that support for 
Airbus was not found to have affected jobs and profits in 
the US aircraft industry. And Airbus said that the support 
system itself—based on loans repaid as planes are sold—
had not been faulted. 
 Meanwhile, the EU has made a similar complaint over 
the US’s alleged support of Boeing. However, the WTO’s 
report into US government funding received by Boeing has 
been delayed.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 INTRODUCTION 
 Over the past decade international business activity has increased dramatically, especially 
among the   triad   nations. As has already been noted in  Chapter 1 , foreign direct investment 
and trade are at an all-time high. At the same time, however, the most active econ omies in 
the international arena have remained the same: the United States, Japan, and the members 
of the EU15, especially Germany, France, the UK, and Italy. During the current decade, a 
growing number of other countries will become increasingly prominent on the interna-
tional business stage. China is moving quickly to establish itself as a major player. Others 
that we will be hearing from increasingly will include Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, 
Mexico, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Singapore, South Korea, and China to 
name but 10. Yet despite the increase of international activity by these countries and others 
in emerging economies, MNEs from the triad will continue to account for most of the 
world’s foreign direct investment and trade. For this reason, every student of international 
business should be familiar with the triad and be aware of its impact on world commerce.  
 In  Chapter 1  we pointed out that two of the drivers of globalization are foreign direct 
investment and trade. In this chapter we want to look more closely at these drivers and 
the role that the triad plays in both. We begin by examining some of the main reasons for 
 foreign direct investment (FDI)   in a triad context.  
 Much FDI is intra-regional (see  Table   3.1   ). It has also been growing faster within 
the EU15 region of the triad, rather than globally. It has, however, declined in North 
America as NAFTA has substituted freer trade for FDI. In Asia, there has been a recent 
increase in intra-regional FDI. Japan, the largest source of FDI in the region, has only 
26.4  percent of its FDI in other Asian countries. The vast majority of Japanese FDI is in 
North America (33.6 percent) and Western Europe (36.5 percent).       1 ( Table  3.1 on FDI is 
similar to  Table  1.2 on trade.)

 FDI is the ownership and control of foreign assets. In practice, FDI usually involves the own-
ership, whole or partial, of a company in a foreign country. This is called a foreign subsidiary. 
This equity investment can take a variety of forms. One is through the purchase of an ongoing 
company. For example, Solectron, the world’s largest contract electronics ﬁ rm, bought 
C-Mac Industries of Canada in order to acquire C-Mac’s expertise in assembling high-end 
telecommunications and networking systems. 2  Rather than building this business from 
scratch, Solectron bought its way into the industry through FDI. Later Flextronics, Singapore 
acquired Selectron in 2007. Another common example of FDI is to set up a new overseas oper-
ation as either a joint venture or a totally owned enterprise. For example, Panasonic, formerly 
known as Matsushita has positioned itself to become a major competitor in the European 
digital industry. It has entered into a joint venture with British Telecommunications plc for

CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
the purpose of developing multimedia wireless services and products.       3  It is important to 
remember that FDI is different from   portfolio investment  , which entails the purchase of 
ﬁ nancial securities (especially bonds) in other ﬁ rms for the purpose of realizing a ﬁ nancial 
gain when these marketable assets are sold. The objective of FDI is to provide the investing 
company with the opportunity to actively manage and control a foreign ﬁ rm’s activities, 
whereas the objective of portfolio investment is to achieve growth in the value of its ﬁ nan-
cial holdings. 4  
 Businesses are interested in taking an ownership position or gaining control of foreign 
assets for a number of reasons. In  Chapter 2  we briefly discussed six of these reasons. The 
following section elaborates on these reasons.

the UN’s World Investment Report ranking. In the EU, for example, companies in smaller 
economies need to look outside of their home borders. This helps to explain why 78.73 per-
cent of Royal Dutch/Shell’s assets and 82.79 percent of BP’s assets are in foreign markets, 
including the markets of other EU members. General Electric has over 50 percent of its sales 
outside of the United States. Another 4.5 percent of GE’s sales are in Canada and Mexico, 
yielding intra-regional sales at 54.85 per cent.  
 The same is true of revenues. In 2008, about 60 percent of Royal Dutch/Shell’s sales 
originate outside its markets in the EU home region. Similarly 63 percent of BP’s sales 
are from outside the EU. 5  Similarly, in North America, where Canada’s economy is only 
10 percent the size of that of the United States, Canadian companies like Thomson Reuters 
Corporation have 96.5 percent of their assets in foreign markets, most notably the United 
States whereas the assets in Canada only accounts for 3.5 percent in 2008.       6 
 In regional terms, among firms with large foreign assets some continue to derive a con-
siderable amount of revenues in their home region. For example, Vodafone and France 
Telecom derive 82.21 and 79.35 percent of total revenues, respectively, in the EU. Only 8 
of the 25 firms with the highest assets abroad, as listed in  Table   3.2   , have over 50 percent 
of their sales in a region other than their own. 
 There are also thousands of smaller firms worldwide that earn the bulk of their rev-
enue from international customers. For an example, see the case  International Business 
Strategy in Action: Aflac . SMEs also find that with the growth of large multinationals there 
is often a need for local suppliers; if they do well, there is a good chance that the MNE will 
extend the contract and allow them to supply other worldwide locations. So they, too, are 
interested in FDI because it can help them increase their sales and profits.  
 Foreign markets often offer more lucrative opportunities than do domestic markets. 
This helps to explain why Coca-Cola and IBM now earn more sales revenue and profits 
overseas than they do in the United States and why PepsiCo has become Mexico’s larg-
est consumer products company. In Japan, it helps to explain why in 2009, 63 percent of 
Honda’s and over 70 percent of Sony’s revenues come from overseas sales (see Table 2C, 
 Chapter 2 ). 7  It also helps account for the decision by Tesco plc, the British supermarket 
firm, to expand operations into Eastern Europe and Asia. And the same is true for Wal-
Mart, which in recent years has expanded rapidly and now has stores on four continents 
and appears on the verge of becoming a major competitor in the EU thanks to its FDI in 
the UK. 8  However, for most firms, including some listed above, “foreign” means in its own 
region; for example, Wal-Mart has 94.5 percent in North America; Tesco has 93.6 percent 
in Europe. 
  Enter rapidly growing markets 
 Some international markets are growing much faster than others, and FDI provides 
MNEs with the chance to take advantage of these opportunities. A good example is China. 
Over the past few years the Chinese economy has grown at an annual rate of around 
7–11 percent. 9  These data also suggest that, as the country continues to move toward a 
market-driven economy, MNEs are likely to ﬁ nd a huge demand for goods and services 
that cannot be satisﬁ ed by local ﬁ rms alone. Simply put, China is a market where most 
multinationals want to have a presence despite the fact that there are many problems in 
doing business there, and few MNEs have been able to extract an adequate return on their 
investment. 
 China is not the only emerging market being targeted by multinationals. A growing 
number of companies are using FDI to gain a foothold in Eastern Europe by acquiring 
local firms or setting up joint ventures there. India has also become a large recipient of FDI, 
particularly in the technology sector (see the Real Case in  Chapter 14 ).

CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Reduce costs 
 An MNE can sometimes achieve substantially lower costs by going abroad than by produc-
ing at home (see the case  International Business Strategy in Action: Lafarge and Cemex: 
concrete multinationals ). If labor expenses are high and represent a signiﬁ cant portion 
of overall costs, an MNE may be well advised to look to other geographic areas where the 
goods can be produced at a much lower labor price. Surprisingly perhaps, in recent years 
 Aflac 
 The insurance industry is dominated by many well-known 
names: Prudential, Aetna, Northwestern, etc. Prior to 2000, 
few people in North America had ever heard of Aflac Inc. of 
Columbus, Georgia. However, the company has been the 
most successful insurer in Japan, with annual revenues 
of $18.3 billion and profits well over $1.497 billion in 2009. 
Aflac is the world’s leading seller of cancer insurance, which 
helps to pay the cost of treating the disease, and it holds 
90 percent of the Japanese market for this coverage. The 
Japanese subsidiary accounts for by 73.8 percent of Aflac’s 
pretax earnings and insures one out of every four Japanese. 
 The firm began doing business in Japan in 1974. Initially 
Aflac approached big Japanese insurers as potential joint-
venture partners; none of them was interested. Eventually 
the Ministry of Finance gave the company a license to sell 
insurance, primarily because no Japanese insurer was in 
the business so that there would be no competition for 
local firms. 
 A key to Aflac’s rapid growth and profitability is its sys-
tem of selling through corporate agencies. The firm has 
set up in-house subsidiaries in Japanese corporations 
to handle the sale of its insurance. These subsidiaries 
would be illegal distributors in the United States, but they 
are very common in Japan. As a result, Aflac eventually 
ended up with over 40,000 Japanese companies offering its 
policies to their employees. From Hitachi to Sony, Toyota to 
Nissan, and Mitsui to Mitsubishi, policyholders throughout 
the country pay premiums of approximately $21 a month 
through an automatic payroll deduction plan. Moreover, 
once they are signed up, few Japanese drop out. In contrast 
to the United States, where only 25 percent of health and 
accident insurance policyholders remain with the same 
company for a decade or more, in Japan 75 percent of Aflac 
policyholders have been with Aflac for 10 or more years. 
 Will Aflac be able to continue its success in the market? 
In many countries such as the United States, cancer insur-
ance is declining in popularity because coverage is now 
provided by basic policies. In Japan, however, the first 
stage of cancer treatment can cost up to $50,000. Even 
though the Japanese government is expected to introduce 
national care insurance, it has made clear that it will not be 
able to cover the full cost. Furthermore, about four years 
ago the company began to diversify its product line. Today 
over 30 percent of all sales in Japan are for non-cancer-
related insurance. As a result of the costs associated with 
cancer, Aflac’s supplemental coverage remains very popu-
lar. The additional success of its new products makes Aflac 
find the Japanese market to be profitable. 
 Perhaps the biggest challenge to Aflac’s Japanese mar-
ket share is market deregulation. Aflac has functioned 
practically as a monopoly in Japan over the past 30 years. 
In 2001, the Japanese government allowed Nippon Life 
Insurance and Tokio Marine & Fire to compete in the sup-
plementary insurance market. Aflac need not worry in 
the short term, since these companies’ operating costs 
are four times its own. In the long run, however, other 
companies might want to wrestle this profitable market 
away from Aflac. The company is well aware of this and 
is expanding its reach by partnering with Dai-Ichi Mutual, 
Japan’s second-largest insurance company, to distribute 
each other’s policies. In addition, a joint venture with 
Communicationware Corporation has seen the develop-
ment of aflacdirect.com, the first company to provide 
insurance solely on the Internet. 
 Aflac has also turned to its domestic market by launching 
an aggressive marketing campaign featuring a mascot. The 
Aflac duck, as it has become known, has appeared in a series 
of television ads screaming Aaaaflaack to oblivious charac-
ters. This has had its desired effect, and today 95 percent of 
Americans recognize the name Aflac.

 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
some Canadian manufacturers have been moving operations across the border to take 
advantage of lower US labor unit costs. 
 A second important cost factor is materials. If materials are in short supply or must be 
conveyed a long distance, it may be less expensive to move production close to the source 
of supply than to import the materials. 
 A third critical cost factor is energy. If the domestic cost of energy for making the 
product is high, the company may be forced to set up operations overseas near sources of 
cheaper energy. 
 A fourth important factor is transportation costs. A highly price-competitive product in 
one country might have to retail at uncompetitive prices in another country once transpor-
tation costs are added. The case  International Business Strategy in Action: Lafarge and 
Cemex illustrates this situation. 
 In recent years many firms have used all four of these reasons to justify moving assembly 
operations to other countries. For example, low-skill labor costs are much lower in Mexico 
than in the United States, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Singapore, so Mexico has become 
a prime target for the manufacture of labor-intensive products. In fact, some US firms have 
even set up  twin factories , or   maquiladoras   , which involve production operations on 
both sides of the border and the shipment of goods between the two countries. As a result, 
today US components are shipped into Mexico duty free, assembled by Mexican workers, 
and then re-exported to the United States or other foreign markets under favorable tariff 
provisions. We further discuss the  maquiladora industry in  Chapter 19 .    
  Gain a foothold in economic blocs 
 As we have noted on a number of occasions thus far, there are three major international 
economic blocs. MNEs that acquire a company in one of these blocs or that enter into 
an alliance to do business in one of these economic strongholds can obtain a number of 
beneﬁ ts including the right to sell their output without having to be burdened by import 
duties or other restrictions. In the case of NAFTA, for example, the United States–Canada 
Free Trade Agreement of 1989 was the initial step in fashioning a giant North American 
market. In January 1994 this agreement was expanded to include Mexico, and in 2005 the 
Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA). International MNEs wanting to do business 
in North America are ﬁ nding that it is important to gain a foothold in this region through 
FDI. The same is true in the EU. In 2004, the membership of this bloc increased from 15 to 
25 with the admission of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007. 
Turkey has also requested to join the union. Meanwhile in Asia, while Japan continues to 
be the major economic power, we are likely to see the rise of an “Asian bloc” that includes 
countries such as Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South 
Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. On February 27, 2009, ASEAN (Association of South East 
Asian Nations)–Australia–New Zealand Free Trade Area was signed and came into effect 
on January 1, 2010. The ASEAN plus four is a set of  bilateral trade agreements/strategic 
partnerships between ASEAN and the four Asian countries of  Japan, Korea, China and 
India. Through the use of intra-regional trade and FDI agreements, these countries are 
creating a bloc that provides a balance to NAFTA and the EU. During the next two dec-
ades, it is highly likely that the major economic powers and those in the next economic tier 
will cooperate to create these blocs in order to stimulate their respective economies and to 
provide a competitive stance for ﬁ rms doing business under their umbrella. This means 
that in Europe we are likely to see most countries including the Russian Federation (but 
perhaps not Switzerland) becoming members of the EU, while in the Western hemisphere 
most countries of North and South America joining NAFTA through a more active FTAA.

CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Lafarge and Cemex: concrete multinationals 
 Cement is extremely heavy and very costly to ship long 
distances. Producers must place cement plants near 
limestone deposits and/or a short distance from large 
urban areas so that materials can be shipped to their final 
destination. If the cement has to be shipped a long distance 
due to a lack of adequate resources, this is done by boat. 
For example, Canadian firms export cement to the United 
States by shipping it across the Great Lakes. 
 Originally, the need to be near natural resources as 
well as a given market created an industry of small local-
ized cement companies. As sophisticated logistic systems 
allowed economies of scale to be achieved in this industry, 
firms began to merge with nearby rivals, eventually acquir-
ing firms in foreign markets. 
 The largest of these is Lafarge, a French MNE that 
accounts for 10 percent of the world’s cement capacity and 
has operations in 75 countries. The firm is the leader in the 
European market and depends on it for 50 percent of its 
revenues. In North America, the firm is the third-largest 
cement producer and derives 20 percent of its revenues 
in 2009. Yet, it is Asia where the company is now putting 
its focus. All but a few countries in this region still have 
 significant building to do for their infrastructure to meet 
the needs of their populations and to catch up to industrial-
ized countries. 
 Lafarge is already the market leader in both the 
Philippines and Malaysia, but it is in China where it sees the 
greatest opportunity. In China, where thousands of cement 
manufacturers with varying degrees of efficiency and 
technology are scattered throughout the country, Lafarge 
hopes to bring its state-of-the-art technology and experi-
ence to make China one of the firm’s major markets. China 
is presently the largest producer of cement, accounting 
for one-third of the world’s production, and demand is 
expected to increase further as the country continues to 
modernize. 
 Cemex SA is Mexico’s largest cement maker. It is 
also the third-largest cement maker in the world, and in 
recent years the company has been much more profit-
able than its two larger competitors thanks to a series of 
well-executed strategies. These include an international 
expansion strategy that is very similar to Lafarge’s: to look 
for markets with long-term economic growth potential, 
large and growing populations, and high pent-up demand 
from below-average construction. Cemex’s efforts have 
paid off. Since 1985, when Lorenzo Zambrano took over as 
chief executive of his family business, the firm has become 
Mexico’s top multinational with operations in 30 countries 
across five continents. In 2002, Cemex was the first firm 
from a developing country to enter the list of the world’s 
top 100 transnational firms, according to the UN’s  World 
Investment Report . And, in Latin America, Cemex had the 
best-known construction brand in 2003.  
 The firm’s international excursions began in 1992 with 
the acquisition of two Spanish cement companies. Soon 
after, Cemex acquired and fixed up smaller cement com-
panies in Latin America and the Caribbean. Most recently it 
purchased Saraburi Cement of Thailand, a move designed 
to give it a base of operations in Asia. When Cemex initially 
embarked on this strategy, many bankers were concerned 
that the company would still be making most of its money 
in Mexico, and a devaluation of the peso would severely 
impact its international operations. In late 1994, when 
the Mexican government suddenly devalued its currency, 
Cemex was generating only 25 percent of its earnings 
from overseas operations, and the firm was highly lever-
aged in dollars. However, instead of pulling back, Cemex 
convinced the bankers that the best strategy was to press 
forward and buy cement companies in Colombia and 
Venezuela. The decision was fortuitous. Venezuela soon 
devalued its own currency, but as its economy went into 
a tailspin Cemex sent in some of its own executives to 
straighten out the operation, reorganize the administrative 
and information system, and cut the workforce. By the end 
of the year Cemex had doubled the unit’s annual cash flow 
to $200 million. 
 One distinct difference in Lafarge’s and Cemex’s strat-
egies in developing countries is that Cemex is not entering 
the Chinese market, at least not yet. Although China has the 
characteristics that Cemex is looking for, in demographics,

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
The ﬁ nal result will be three “broad” triad regions, and any company that wants to do busi-
ness worldwide will have to have a presence in all three blocs. Indeed, a “global” ﬁ rm is best 
deﬁ ned as one with at least 20 percent of its sales in each region of the triad. In 2001, only 
9 of the largest 500 companies in the world ﬁ tted this description and the trend has been 
conﬁ rmed with 5-year data set 2001–2005. 10 
 Protect domestic markets 
 Another reason for FDI is to protect one’s domestic market. Many MNEs are now entering 
an international market in order to attack potential competitors and thus prevent them 
from expanding their operations overseas. These multinationals reason that a competitor 
is less likely to enter a foreign market when it is busy defending its home-market position. 
Similarly, sometimes an MNE will enter a foreign market in order to bring pressure on a 
company that has already challenged its own home market. For example, 10 days after Fuji 
began building its ﬁ rst manufacturing facility in the United States, Kodak announced its 
decision to open a manufacturing plant in Japan. 
 Sometimes the decision to go international also helps a firm to protect its position with 
current clients which are going international. For example, when Honda Motors set up 
operations in Indiana in 1989 through an Isuzu–Subaru plant in Lafayette, Nippondenso, 
a producer of automobile radiators and heaters, established a plant nearby. So did 
Mitsubishi Bank, the primary bank for Honda. In addition to the extra business it gener-
ates, this strategy helps to combat local competitors, such as Indiana manufacturers and 
banks, which might otherwise gain inroads and perhaps even threaten domestic business 
should they decide to set up operations in Japan.  
  Protect foreign markets  
 Sometimes MNEs will use FDI in order to protect their foreign markets. In the United 
States, for example, from 1981 to 1991 the total number of service stations had declined by 
potential growth, and a lack of infrastructure, the country 
is riddled with price controls and a taxing system designed 
to drain profits. Whether losses in the present are war-
ranted for future growth in China might not be relevant. 
Cemex is riddled with debt from all its acquisitions and 
might not be able to afford low levels of profits in China. 
 Cemex’s expansion is not limited to developing mar-
kets. After its acquisition of Southdown for $2.6 billion in 
2000, it became the largest cement producer in the United 
States. The move made sense after the United States 
imposed punitive antidumping tariffs on Mexican cement 
in 1990. Between August 2000 and July 2001, Cemex paid 
$29.5 million in duties which, in turn, were dispersed among 
US producers that claimed to be affected by the dumping. 
 Meanwhile in Mexico, in 2009, where the firm still gener-
ates 21 percent of its revenues, a stronger economy has 
resulted in higher sales and profits. As a result, Cemex 
is now paying down its debt and expanding operations 
in Europe and Asia where it is both buying and building 
plants. In 2009, the company records annual revenue of 
$14.659 billion and EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) 
of $2.679 billion. 
 Lafarge’s and Cemex’s biggest assets are their financial 
strength, in terms of cash flow, technology, and expertise. 
They compete in an industry with a sea of small, often 
inefficient, players. At present, these firms are snatching 
market share from these smaller competitors across the 
developing world and competing with each other in the 
developed world.

over 50 percent. BP, which had a substantial presence in this market, realized that in order 
to protect its investment it would be necessary to make a substantial investment in order 
to upgrade its stations and increase its market share. The company refines and markets 
petroleum products and realized that if it could attract a growing number of customers 
to its service stations, it could profit handsomely by moving its products directly down-
stream to the final consumer. The company also merged with Amoco, thus assuring itself 
of a good North American refining and retail market share and, in the process, protecting 
its investment in this foreign market.  Unfortunately BP inherited old refineries which had 
accidents, leading to legal hassles. Following the Gulf Oil spill accident of April 20, 2010, 
BP announced plans to sell assets, including those in the United States to raise funds of  
$30 billion to help pay compensation for the oil spill.
Acquire technological and managerial know-how
Still another reason for FDI is to acquire technological and managerial expertise. One way 
of doing this is to set up operations near those of leading competitors. This is why some 
US firms have moved some of their research and development facilities to Japan. With this 
strategy, they find it is easier to monitor the competition and to recruit scientists from local 
universities and competitive laboratories. Kodak used to be an excellent example before it 
filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2012.
The company made the decision to build an 180,000 ft2 (17,000 m2) research center in 
Japan, and it started cultivating leading scientists to help with recruiting. Kodak used all 
the same approaches that Japanese firms employ in the United States: financing research 
by university scientists and offering scholarships to outstanding young Japanese engineers, 
some of whom would later join Kodak. In addition, the company hired internationally 
known scientists to help attract experienced colleagues from leading Japanese ­companies 
and to recruit young graduates from host universities such as the Tokyo Institute of 
Technology. As a result, Japan was the center of Kodak’s worldwide research efforts in a 
number of high-technology areas.11

What are three reasons for the Europeans creating the Airbus consortium?
One of the reasons for the Europeans creating the Airbus consortium was to enter a 
rapidly growing market. As can be seen from the data in the case, billions of dollars has 
been be spent on new aircraft from 2007 until now. Singapore Airlines alone was the first 
airline putting out over $8 billion for 25 A380 craft, and it is only one of a number of firms 
that have placed firm orders with Airbus. So there is a huge market for large craft, and 
the Europeans wanted to be in this lucrative market. A second reason for creating the con-
sortium was to help build a stronger EU economy. Airbus provided thousands of jobs and 
billions of euros to the member countries, and, even with its new arrangement in which it 
is no longer managed by governments but rather by investors, the company is continuing 
to provide both jobs and revenues in Europe. A third reason that Airbus was created was 
to protect the domestic market by making it less reliant on foreign firms such as Boeing. 
Given that Airbus now holds 50 percent of the commercial aircraft market, this objective 
has clearly been attained.

 As seen thus far, there are many reasons why MNEs make FDI. In addition, much of this 
FDI, and trade as well, is made by the core triad members: the United States, the EU, and 
Japan. The following examines these ﬁ ndings in more depth. 
  The triad’s domination of FDI and trade 
 Over the past decade the triad has accounted for an extremely large percentage of both 
FDI  and  world trade. For example, triad countries make billions of dollars of investments 
in one another. In 2008, total the United States’ FDI was $1,809.876 billion in the EU and 
$79.235 billion in Japan. In turn the EU15 countries and Japan had total investments in the 
United States of $1,622.911 billion and $259.569 billion, respectively. EU15 FDI in Japan 
was $86.915 billion while Japanese FDI in the EU was $161.649 billion.       12  Quite clearly, triad 
countries are investing large sums of money in each other’s operations. 
 In addition, as seen in  Table  3.3a , the percentage of global FDI accounted for by the 
core triad countries in 2008 is 73.61 percent. Even though the amount of worldwide FDI 
has more than tripled over the past 10 years, the triad remained the engine of this growth. 
The EU15 now account for half of the world’s FDI, partly because intra-regional FDI is 
included in this total. 
 Much the same picture holds for trade patterns in the triad as we saw for FDI; there are 
very strong two-way trade flows. The EU15 conduct a large amount of annual trade with 
Japan and the United States, and both Japan and the United States do a great deal of trad-
ing with both the EU15 and with each other.  Table   3.3b    reports the trade of the core triad 
and shows that in 2008 these three blocs accounted for 48.09 percent of all world imports 
and over 55.37 percent of all world exports. As a result of such trade (and FDI), it is clear 
that the core triad is the major economic force in the international arena.  
   Triad FDI clusters 
 The above data clearly show the importance of the triad in international business, but this 
impact extends well beyond the FDI and trade that take place among its members. Triad 
countries have also become major investors in poorer nations. For example, in 2008, US FDI 
in Latin America and other Western hemisphere was $563.809 billion.       13  Typically, recipi-
ents of FDI are part of an   FDI cluster  , which is a group of developing countries that are 
usually located in the same geographic region as the triad member and have some form of

CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
economic link to it. For example, the United States tends to be a dominant investor in Latin 
America, and countries such as Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina are part of its FDI cluster. 
Similarly, Eastern Europe is a favorite investment target for the EU15 countries and helps 
account for the FDI made by Germany and France in the Czech Republic and the Russian 
Federation. The latter is part of the EU15 FDI cluster. And as might be expected, Japan’s 
FDI cluster includes China, Singapore, and Thailand, countries where Japanese MNEs have 
invested large sums of money.  
 Not all developing countries, however, have been successful in attracting triad invest-
ment. One reason is because much of this investment has been used by multinationals to 
build regional networks, often starting near their home base and then working outward. 
For example, 69 percent of all FDI in Mexico comes from US firms and over 80 percent of 
all FDI in Estonia derives from the EU15 countries. 14  The UNCTAD has also found that in 
2008, more than half of all investment into developing countries is going to three nations: 
Brazil, China, and India. 15  And much of this money comes from triad countries that are 
located in that part of the world. So Brazil and Mexico are recipients of much US FDI, and 
China and Singapore are favorite FDI targets for Japanese firms. 
 Such investment policies help reinforce our earlier comments about the triad’s domi-
nance of regional economic clusters. In the future, triad members may well continue to 
strengthen their FDI in specific regions, as in Europe, where the EU15 is a major force in 
economic development. At the same time, these types of investment strategies by triad 
members may restrict trade and investment opportunities for some developing countries. 
This is why it is so important for non-triad countries to be linked to the triad in some way. 
As will be explained later in the book, by gaining linkage to the triad, a country can benefit 
by tapping these enormous markets as a supplier to large MNEs or by selling directly to 
customers in these markets.

 During the ﬁ rst decades of this century, the triad will continue to dominate the inter national 
business scene. In particular, members will pursue market opportunities within their own 
triad as well as that of the other members. For example, retailing in the United States is 
dominated by Wal-Mart. However, the company is not content to simply sell in its home 
country so it has expanded within NAFTA (Canada and Mexico). It has also expanded

into both Europe and Asia. In 2009, Wal-Mart reports, by segment data, that Wal-Mart 
US accounts for 64 percent, US Sam’s Club 12 percent and International 25 percent. 16 In 
Europe, meanwhile, Tesco is expanding rapidly across Europe where it has 86.54 percent of 
its sales, and it is now pushing into Asia. As of September 2009, Carrefour, the French retail 
giant, has more than 13,687 stores throughout Europe (87.70 percent) out of 15,594 stores 
worldwide, where it has 69 percent of its sales and 1,228 stores in Latin America (8.87 per-
cent of total stores), 679 stores in Asia (4.35 percent of total stores).       17  This intra-regional 
pattern of activity is common for triad ﬁ rms. In fact, one of the best examples is provided 
by the automobile industry where auto makers are very much region based. For example, 
Ford Motors has 53.83 percent of its sales in North America.       18 
 Thus, a more careful analysis of international business shows that “international” 
expansion does not necessarily mean “global” expansion. For example, Wal Mart has 
76 percent sales (measured by absolute US$ sales figures by segments) in the United States 
alone (US Wal Mart and US Sam Club) and if Canada and Mexico is added, 94.5 percent 
of its total sales is in North America (see  Chapter 1 , Real Case: Wal-Mart). This means 
that the home region of the triad is still its locus for strategy. It does not have a “global” 
strategy. This even confuses other professors. For example, an entire chapter in a book on 
global strategy is directed to learning the “lessons from Wal-Mart’s globalization.” 19 Yet 
Wal-Mart is not really a global company. Indeed, in the United Nations  World Investment 
Report 2001  it is reported that Wal-Mart has one of the lowest scores of any of the 100 larg-
est MNEs. On a transnational index Wal-Mart has a “network spread index” (a measure 
of actual to possible FDI—of which there were a possible 187 measures in 1999) of under 
5 percent. Other low scores are for Woodbridge, Mitsubishi, Petróleos de Venezuela, 
Edison, and Nippon Oil. In contrast, many MNEs score over 30 percent, for example, 
Shell, Nestlé, Unilever, TotalFina, Aventis, and ABB. 
 As  Figure   3.1    indicates, Wal-Mart is a regional but not a global business. As of 2009, the 
firm had 73 percent of its sales (as measured by stores) in its home region of NAFTA. Latin 
America accounted for 14 percent of sales and other regions for another 13 percent. The 
locus of its business model strategy and structure is regional (see  Figure   3.1   ).

How will Airbus help the EU compete in the United States? 
 Airbus will open up markets in the United States by offering alternative aircraft to those 
being produced by Boeing. These Airbus offerings are not only reliable but fuel efficient 
and, as noted in the case, are often provided at very competitive prices. As a result, Airbus 
has been able to tap a US market that had been previously closed to the EU because no 
European company could compete with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Now Airbus has 
been able to land contracts with US firms such as American Airlines, one of the largest 
carriers in the world. If the A380 proves successful, it will help Airbus compete ever more 
effectively in the United States.

  The world’s regional automotive industry 
 In 2001 there were 29 automotive ﬁ rms in the world’s largest 500 ﬁ rms. 20  Now in 2009, 
there are still 29, and they average $56.257 billion in sales. Only one of these is a “global” 
ﬁ rm, Mazda, deﬁ ned as having at least 20 percent of sales in each of the three regions of the 

85
CHAPTER 3  The Triad And International Business
broad triad of the EU, North America, and Asia. Indeed 18 of the 29 auto and auto parts 
firms are home-region based, with an average of over 60 percent of their sales as intra-
regional (see Table 3.4). There are a few special cases. There are 10 bi-regional firms, 7 auto 
makers and 3 parts makers, with over 20 percent of their sales in two parts of the triad and 
less than 50 percent in any region, including Toyota, Daimler, Honda, Nissan, Volvo, Tata 
Motors, and Magna. The weighted average of intra-regional sales in the automotive sector 
is 61.87 percent, quite close to the manufacturing sector’s average of 65.6 percent. In 2001, 
the intra-regional sales in the automotive sector is 57.3 percent; in 2009, it is 61.87 percent, 
indicating an increasing trend. The auto makers were causalities of the worldwide econ­
omic downturn since 2008, they have to rely more on the intra-regional sales to survive. 
The automotive sector is concentrated in the triad regions of the United States (North 
America), Europe, and Japan (Asia). In each of these regions, domestic producers have a 
bigger share of the market than foreign producers. General Motors, Ford, Chrysler (a US 
company again for a short while after the merger with Daimler Benz collapsed in 2007, 
but it was subsequently sold to the Italian car maker Fiat in 2009) have well over half 
of the US market for motor vehicles. In 2000, the largest three domestic auto makers in  
the United States had 62.3 percent of the US market. Imports accounted for approximately 
15 percent of the US market but do not include locally made Japanese brands. However, in 
2008, US auto makers were in deep crisis. General Motors, along with Chrysler and Ford, 
was getting a bailout from the US government. General Motors, which used to be the big-
gest auto company in the US back in the 1950s, has been hit hard by the economic crisis 
and sought US federal protection from bankruptcy. General Motors has been restructured. 
With the bankruptcy and subsequent sale to Fiat, Chrysler is now known as Chrysler LLC. 
Among the big three auto makers, in 2009, Ford yielded profit for the first time after four 
consecutive years of making loss.21
In general, the European market is more fragmented than the North American market. 
According to European Automobile Manufacturers Association, in 2009, the top manufac-
turing groups in Europe was Volkswagen with 21.1 percent of the European market for pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles. Peugeot SA and Ford followed with 12.9 percent 
and 10.3 percent of this market, respectively. The five largest European brands—Volkswagen, 
Fiat, Peugeot/ Citroen and Audi—accounted for 43 percent of the European market. Ford, 
the third-largest competitor in Europe, had 8.9 percent of the market. Japanese and South 
Korean firms accounted for approximately 12.3 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. 
The European car market declined by 1.6 percent in new passenger car registrations in 
2009, compared to that of 2008. Car scrapping incentives, especially in Germany, France, 
and the United Kingdom prevented what would have otherwise been a dismal year for new 
car sales in Europe.

 Although Volkswagen did well in Europe in 2009 by increasing both market share and 
number of cars sold, other German brands and manufacturers suffered with mostly double 
digit losses. Troubled Swedish car manufacturer Saab saw sales decline by 59.1 percent 
while Volvo lost 9.3 percent. 
 Manufacturers of cheaper car brands did generally better. The best performers in Europe 
in 2009 were Renault’s budget Dacia brand (29.2 percent) and Hyundai (26.6 percent).

CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 As a result of the ending of car scrapping incentives, 2010 was a very bad year for car 
sales in Europe. In October 2010, in the UK, new car sales were 8.9 percent lower, while 
France and Germany saw falls of 8.2 percent and 17.8 percent respectively compared to 
2009. Spain saw the biggest fall, dropping 27.3 percent. Overall, registrations of new cars in 
Europe were 9.2 percent lower, with 1.26 million new vehicles registered.  
 The Japanese market is the most consolidated of all triad markets. In 2009, Toyota 
alone has 36.88 percent of the passenger car market, 18.29 percent of the truck market and 
79.72 per cent of the bus market. Honda, the second-largest Japanese auto maker, accounts 
for 11.82 percent of passenger car market. Together, Toyota, Honda, Renault–Nissan, and 
Suzuki, the four largest Japanese auto makers, have 71.26 percent of the Japanese passenger 
car market. Ford, which acquired domestic Mazda, accounts for 10.16 percent of the pas-
senger car market. General Motors, the US leader and the world’s largest car manufacturer, 
has a mere 0.4 percent of this market. VW, the European leader, has 1.2 percent. Imports 
are a mere 4.5 percent of the Japanese market and include imports by Japanese companies 
manufacturing abroad. 22 
 Excluding Japan, Toyota is the market leader in two of the six largest countries in Asia–
Pacific: Malaysia and Thailand. South Korea is dominated by Hyundai, which controls 
72.9 percent of that market. In 2009, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) was the leader in India, 
with 47.68  percent market share. In the comparable period 2008, MSI had a 53.13 percent 
share of the 440,069 units car market, with sales of 233,811 units. Indeed, only Australia 
and China have Western-based market leaders. In Australia, as at March 2009, Toyota is 
the top brand with sales with 26.49 percent of the market, followed by General Motors’s 
brand Holden (Holden Commodore vehicle), which holds 14.64 percent of the market. 
Including Japan, the top six Asian auto makers control 69.5 percent of the Asian market. 
This includes Renault–Nissan (8.1 percent) and Ford–Mazda (4.4 percent), Japanese com-
panies in which Western firms have a dominant share.       23 
 Although the majority of the market in each of the three triad regions is controlled by 
home-region-oriented companies, foreign companies continue to play a major role in 
each region. For example, Ford holds 8.9 percent of the European market and is the third-
largest competitor. A number of foreign companies attained a competitive position by 
acquiring the operations of a local producer, such as Tata Motors. Tata also acquired 
Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. of South Korea in 2004, and bought Jaguar and Land 
Rover from Ford Motor in 2007. Other companies developed their business through 
organic growth in foreign markets, such as Toyota and Honda in North America. 
 These findings counter a number of popular myths about the “archetypal global 
industry,” many dating from the 1980s and early 1990s which saw the global expansion 
of Japanese firms in the industry. Common views included that a global car and a global 
car firm would soon evolve, that all production would shift to cheap labor regions leaving 
“hollow corporations” in the United States and Europe, and that sales by incumbents in 
the largest markets would be overtaken by more competitive foreign rivals. Yet such global 
car industry predictions have not come to pass for the key reason that the industry operates 
regionally, not globally. 
 The auto industry operates largely in “clusters” of localized activity within each major 
triad region. 24  There are networks of key suppliers, other suppliers, key distributors, other 
partners, and the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) assemble cars from imports 
of literally thousands of suppliers, all location bound. This is why, of the 55 million vehicles

 Auto firms are also strongly embedded in a range of other downstream activities and 
after-sales markets including financing (such as Ford Credit), insurance, maintenance and 
repairs (like Ford’s Kwik-Fit operations), parts and accessories, and emergency rescue 
services (such as Ford’s RESCU). These represent a substantial proportion of total rev-
enues for the larger firms and are highly regionally specific.

 Another persistent barrier to a global strategy or a global car is cultural barriers across 
regions. European consumers prefer performance cars with good engines while in the 
United States large comfortable cars are the norm. Even within NAFTA, while the United 
States and Canada prefer automatic transmissions, most cars in Mexico have manual trans-
missions. In terms of customer tastes, it is impossible to market the same car across regions, 
and usually all of the economies of scale for a model are achieved within each major region. 
 Another factor is fuel. Diesel continues to be popular in Europe but is being phased out 
in the United States because of its environmental implications. Rather than phase out the 
better milage fuel, European auto makers are seeking ways of making it a cleaner alternative. 
 Each regional market in which auto makers operate has its own set of environmental 
regulations. In the United States, auto makers must design vehicles to conform to the 
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) regulations and the environmental regulations 
of individual states. Other regulations that relate to automotive design include noise 
control and fuel economy. The companies’ industrial processes are also heavily regulated 
with laws relating to water discharges, air emissions, waste management, and environ-
mental cleanup. European and Asia–Pacific markets have different environmental laws to 
which auto maker’s operations must comply. For instance, the EU is making all car makers 
financially responsible for dismantling and recycling its own vehicles. 
 Finally, tariffs, ranging from 2.5 percent in the United States to 10 percent in some 
European countries to 100 percent in some developing countries, represent another 
significant barrier to globalization. 
 Each region has a particular regulatory and competitive environment in which the major 
world players compete for market share. Local competitors are more adept at meeting the 
demands of their regional markets because they possess know-how on consumer preferences, 
government regulations, and market trends. While foreign companies might hire local per-
sonnel, purchase local car manufacturers, and do extensive market research, companies head-
quartered in that region are more capable of responding to changing circumstances of their 
primary market. We now discuss three of the world’s largest automotive firms in more detail. 
 General Motors 
 One of the world’s largest manufacturers of automobiles is General Motors (GM) (although, 
by 2007, Toyota was overtaking it). In 2009, GM’s revenues totaled $104.589 billion and GM 
accounted for nearly 15 percent of the world’s market for trucks and automobiles. GM pro-
duces and manufactures vehicles in all three triad markets. Nonetheless, 47 percent of its 
sales originate in the United States, its home national market. Including Canada, Mexico, 
markets in North America, this number rises to 55.44 percent of total sales. On the pro-
duction side, its network of North American factories—which exist partly as a result of 
NAFTA—accounts for 65.8 percent of production capacity. An international company, yes, 
but by no means a global company. 
 GM is primarily an automotive company, but it also operates communications services 
businesses and has a financing and insurance arm. Its automotive business is segmented 
geographically: GM North America, GM Europe, GM Latin America/Africa/Mid-East, and 
GM Asia–Pacific. Each of these regions has a set of brands it promotes. In North America, 
for  example, these are Chevrolet, Pontiac, Saturn, etc. In Europe, GM’s brands include Opel, 
Vauxhall, and Holden, among others. GM Daewoo is a brand marketed in South Korea and 
Vietnam. 
 GM is most successful in the North American market, where it holds 28 percent of the 
market, compared to 8.7 percent of the European market, and 3.4 percent of the Asia–
Pacific market. In North America, GM has a competitive advantage in that it is already well 
situated in the market and has a loyal consumer base. In other regions, however, it faces 
competition from local auto makers that know their home regions very well. In Europe, 

89
CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler build high-performance cars. In Asia, competitors build 
smaller, more fuel-efficient cars that cater to local preferences. GMs’ primary market is 
North America, in particular the United States. It derives most of its revenue and most of 
its profits from its home-region operations. Its strategy must balance the benefit of invest-
ing in foreign regions to the benefits of investing in its home-region market. Foreign mar-
kets, though potentially profitable, do not offer the consolidated GM company sufficient 
incentive to switch the focus of its strategy. GM has plans to expand in China, but this is a 
country where rival MNEs are already active and where local Chinese producers are adept 
at appropriating the intellectual property of Western firms. In other words, China offers 
potentially high returns, but has great risks.  
 The world financial crisis and the US government’s restructuring of GM had a dramatic 
effect on sales (see  Table  3.5 and  Figure  3.2 ). 
 In 2008, GM struggled to survive in the financial crisis. GM filed for bankruptcy, and 
a massive government bailout of $50 billion made it practically nationalized. On Novem-
ber 18, 2010, GM was reborn as a public company with initial public offer (IPO), although 
the US government is still a major shareholder. It began trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange after the biggest share sale in the US history. It is 
also a symbolic fresh start for one of America’s biggest corporate failures. 26 
 Toyota 
 In 2009, two regional markets accounted for 78 percent of Toyota’s revenues: Asia (with 
Japan at 48.3 percent of revenues) and North America (at 29.70 percent of revenues); 
Europe was only at 14.1 percent of revenues and rest of the world 7.9 percent. So, it is a 
bi-region-focused company. In terms of units sold, the geographic distribution is similar: 
Asia and Oceania account for 46.2 percent of unit sales (Japan at 38 percent); North America 
for 30.8 percent; and Europe for 15 percent. Thus, in terms of revenue and units sold, 
Toyota is a bi-regional company. Market share shows a slightly different picture. Toyota 
holds approximately 40 percent of the Japanese market but only 10 percent of the North 
American market. Moreover, production is not as dispersed around the world; 75.9 per-
cent of all Toyota cars are still produced in Japan. Only 14.9 percent are produced in North 
America. Other regions account for less than 10 percent of production. 
 Over 10 years, Toyota’s intra-regional percentage of sales has decreased from 57.1 per-
cent to 46.2 percent. One major reason for this is the Japanese market itself, where sales 
decreased from 48.4 percent of total revenues in 1993 to 38.3 percent in 2002. In contrast, 
North American, European, and non-triad sales have steadily increased in importance. In 
1993, Toyota derived 25.4 percent of its sales from North America. This rose to 29.7 per-
cent in 2009; EU restrictions on imports of Japanese cars were one reason why Toyota

historically has been unable to be successful in the European market. European sales 
accounted for a mere 9.9 percent of total sales in 1993, but by 2009 Toyota almost doubled 
the number of units sold so that, in that year, the region accounted for approximately 
15 percent of total sales. This is partly a result not only of more local production but also 
of Toyota learning to cater to the European market. 
 The Asian economies have been in a slump since the 1990s, and Europe has been grow-
ing slowly. This is why the North American market is very important for all Japanese 
manufacturers. Japanese car makers began to manufacture in the United States, the largest 
North American national market, in the 1980s to protect themselves from import restric-
tions. North America is Toyota’s second-largest regional market in terms of revenues. It 
is also highly profitable. In 2002, one-fourth of Toyota’s profits originated in this region. 
 Toyota manufactures locally over two-thirds of the cars it sells in the United States. The 
company’s Canadian plant also serves this regional market, and a Mexican plant in Tijuana 
was expected to increase local production when it opened in 2005. Local responsiveness is 
important. Toyota introduced its luxury models to accommodate the aging and wealthier 
North American baby boomers in the 1990s. Today, the company is introducing cars to 
target the young American customer, the demographic echo of the baby boomers. Since 
60 percent of US car buyers remain loyal to the brand of their first car, it is thus imperative 
to service this young market. 
 American consumers, for their part, have been responsive to the company’s reputation 
for quality and in particular for the lower price at which Toyota’s cars are sold. In fact, 
during economic downturns in which consumers seek more value for their money Toyota 
does better in the United States. The company’s cars not only are less expensive, but also 
consume less gasoline than American cars. The resale value is also higher for Toyota cars. 
One major advantage for Toyota is that it has some of the best manufacturing facilities in 
the world, and it combines this with excellent relationships with its suppliers. The com-
pany is so efficient that, despite the lower price of its cars, it makes an average profit of 
$1,000 on each car sold compared to $330 for GM. 
 Toyota’s European operations are money losers, but the company continues to try to 
access this market and increase its market share from its 3.8 percent level in 2002. To boost 
its image for performance in the region, the company began to compete in Formula One 
races. To protect itself from currency risk, Toyota will now produce a higher percentage of 
its cars within the region. That also means more local procurement. To this end, Porsche 
was asked to produce engines for its European models. Porsche already produces trans-
missions for the company.  
 Until recently, Toyota was one of the most efficient companies at outsourcing pro-
duction to suppliers with whom it enjoys amicable long-term, sometimes  keiretsu -style, 
relationships. If the auto industry is to become more like the electronics industry (as many 
believe may occur), vehicle brand owners (VBOs), such as Toyota, GM, and VW, will be 
the equivalent of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the electronics industry, 
such as Nokia, IBM, and Microsoft, and will concentrate on designing, engineering, and 
marketing vehicles to be sold under their brand while others take care of manufacturing. 
Toyota is probably further along this outsourcing route than other triad auto makers. 
 In 2008, when General Motors stumbled towards bankruptcy, Toyota became the top 
car maker. Toyota sold 8.9 million, while GM sold 8.3 million vehicles. But the problem 
set in with pursuing the target of becoming the biggest. Since 2009, Toyota has been in the 
process of recalling millions of vehicles that are potentially prone to uncontrolled acceler-
ation, following an accident, in which an off-duty traffic officer and three of his relatives 
had died in the United States. The accident accelerator got caught in the floor mat of the 
brand new Lexus, which was deemed a possible cause. Toyota said the wide-ranging vehicle 
check might spread from the United States and Europe to include the Middle East, Latin 

91
CHAPTER 3  The Triad And International Business
America, and Africa. Toyota estimated that the massive vehicle recall could cost it up to  
$2 billion in lost output and sales. In Spring 2009, it reported a $4.4 billion operating 
loss for the fiscal year to March. The accident was a blow to Toyota’s reputation which is 
well known for its quality and “Toyota Way.” The company was in crisis mode. Mr. Akio 
Yoyoda, President, said in Spring: “Toyota has become too big and distant from its custom-
ers.” He criticized the executives for their “undisciplined pursuit of more” and for their 
arrogance, which he referred to as “hubris born of success.”27
Toyota’s sales changed as follows (see Table 3.6 and Figure 3.3).
Daimler AG
When German Daimler-Benz merged with US Chrysler, the aim of the German company 
was to secure a share in the large US economy-class car market. Synergies (for instance, in the 
area of purchasing), it argued, would reduce costs across all operations. At first glance, one 
can argue that the merger achieved its goal. In 2002, 58.7 percent of the company’s revenues 
originated in North America, a trend that had remained relatively stable since 2000. These 
data define the firm as host-region oriented. The numbers can be deceiving, though; soon 
after the merger the Chrysler group was plagued by management defections and decreasing 
profits. In 2007, DaimlerChrysler sold Chrysler to a US private equity firm called Cerberus. 
Two things help explain the troubles of this merger. The first is that these companies 
were producing very different products. Mercedes Benz, a Daimler-Benz brand, had a 
competitive edge in the luxury market. Chrysler produced popular cars for the US mar-
ket. Although the expensive parts of Daimler’s vehicles could be used for more affordable 
Chrysler cars and the cheaper Chrysler parts be used on Daimler vehicles, both these moves 
were likely to reduce the competitive advantage on each of the markets in which the original 
companies operated. Chrysler cars could have become less affordable while Daimler’s 
brand might have lost its reputation for quality. In effect, while some parts can be shared 
and suppliers can manufacture different products for both vehicle brands at lower prices, 
the benefits from the merger were limited by the different product lines of each company.
The second, and perhaps most important, barrier to overcome was the cross-cultural 
differences between the German and US companies. From the beginning, Daimler’s 
management dominated the merged company, which resulted in an outflow of key US 
personnel from management positions and the designer ranks. The Germans tended to 
be bureaucratic while US managers made decisions on the spot. Many US managers left, 
unable to deal with the imposed management style. Capable designers went to rivals GM 
and Ford. Over time, the company has improved its cultural management of the US oper­
ations, and this is improving the company’s overall position in the motor vehicle market.

 In 2009, Daimler is a bi-region-based company where it derives 46.19 percent of its 
 revenue from Europe and 20.99 per cent of its revenue from North America. Its sales 
changed as follows (see  Table  3.7 and  Figure  3.4 ). 
 A closer look back at the merged DaimlerChrysler organization shows, not a cohesive 
organization with a bi-regional market span, but two internal groups with individual 
global standings. The Mercedes Car Group, the non-commercial vehicle successor to the 
German part of the merger, derives 63 percent of its revenues from the European market. 
The Chrysler Group, on the other hand, continues to derive over 90 percent of its revenues 
from the North American market. 
 In terms of production, the Mercedes Group has eight production locations in Europe 
while the Chrysler Group has none. In the NAFTA region, the Chrysler Group has 38 
production locations while the Mercedes Group has only one. This reflects two separate 
entities each trying to capitalize on knowledge of its home region, not a truly bi-regional 
or host-region-oriented company.  
 Like other big three US car makers, Chrysler also struggled to survive in the financial 
crisis. In 2009, Chrysler was saved with the US government’s massive bailout program by a 
“narrow margin.” It has subsequently been sold to the Italian car maker Fiat.       28

How will Airbus help the EU compete in Japan? 
 Japanese airlines will continually need to replace and expand their current stock of air-
craft. US aircraft manufacturers had previously satisfied this demand. However, thanks to 
Airbus the EU now has an industry that can offer Japan a competitive product. Moreover, 
until Japan creates its own worldwide competitive aircraft industry, Airbus will be able to 
continue to tap this market potential.

 Mergers and acquisitions 
 Although all three triad groups have much intra-regional trade and FDI, this does not 
mean that trade or FDI between them has declined. As discussed above, they also have 
invested large amounts of money in each other. For example, in 2008, the EU countries 
had $1,622.911 billion of FDI in the United States and $86.915 billion in Japan. The United 
States imports $377 billion from the EU and $143.4 billion from Japan. So the three groups 
are closely linked in terms of both trade and FDI.       29 
 Moreover, investors have poured billions of dollars into these economies, betting that 
they are going to profit handsomely from these investments. US investors, for example, 

93
CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
spent more than $7 billion in the first five months of 1998 to purchase Asian proper-
ties, most of them in Japan. Part of this development was a result of the weak Japanese 
economy. Many companies there had no capital for expansion and were facing declining 
demand for their goods and services. So they were willing to unload some of their assets 
as well as take on foreign partners who could provide funds and growth opportunities. 
At the same time, the impact of Japanese deregulation was beginning to take effect. For a 
long time both the United States and the EU have been encouraging Japan to reduce its 
protectionist policies and allow greater opportunities for foreign investors. In the early 
1990s the government promised to open up its markets to more foreign goods and even 
agreed to buy more cars, auto parts, and computer equipment from outside vendors. 
As the local economy began to falter and the rules and regulations that used to stymie 
foreign investors began to be withdrawn, the result was a rush by foreign MNEs into this 
marketplace. 
 Similarly, EU firms are very interested in buying US firms and vice versa. Some of the 
largest acquisitions made by EU companies in the United States in recent years include 
the purchase of ARCO by BP Amoco of the UK for over $27 billion, France Telecom’s 
acquisition of NTL for $5.5 billion, and Vivendi Universal’s purchase of USA Networks for 
$10.3 billion. At the same time, US firms have been buying EU companies. Ford Motor put 
out $2.72 billion to acquire Land Rover from BMW and then Tata Motors, India bought 
Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motors for about $2.3 billion in 2008, and Cisco Systems 
paid $2.15 billion for Pirelli of Italy’s fiber-optic operations. 30  So there is still a great deal 
of FDI being conducted between triad countries. 
 In addition to the high level of international business conducted across the triad, com-
panies in the triad are constantly looking for new ideas from other regions that will make 
them more competitive. US and EU firms emulate successful Japanese business practices. 
In the United States, for example, the head of the Federal Reserve System has expressed the 
belief that US antitrust practices are out of date and that competitors should be allowed 
to acquire and merge with each other in order to protect themselves from world com-
petition. This idea has long been popular in Japan where    keiretsus  , or business groups, 
which consist of a host of companies that are linked together through ownership and/or 
joint ventures, dominate the local environment and are able to use their combined wealth 
and connections to dominate world markets. 31  Many firms including Deere & Company, 
Ford, IBM, and Harley-Davidson, to name but four, are copying this form of cooperation. 
Simply put, what happens in one part of the triad often has an effect in other parts.

 In what way did the Airbus consortium use a  keiretsu  approach to building the 
aircraft? Why do you think it opted for this approach? 
 A  keiretsu  is a business group, which often consists of a host of companies that are 
linked together through ownership and/or joint ventures. In the case of Airbus, notice 
how Germany, the UK, and Spain built the aircraft and France assembled it. This is the 
same approach used by  keiretsus  that coordinate their operations in such a way that each 
provides products and services to the group at a very low price. Another reason that the 
consortium undoubtedly opted for this approach is that each participant benefits because 
of the money pumped into its economy for doing this work. Under the new organizational 
arrangement the governmental role in the  keiretsu  disappears but the basic operational 
approach will remain, and the company will still be a  keiretsu  type of organization.

 1   Foreign direct investment (FDI) is the ownership and control of foreign assets. This 
usually means the ownership, whole or partial, of a company in a foreign country.  
 2   There are a number of reasons for FDI. These include increased sales and profits, a 
chance to enter rapidly growing markets, reduced costs, gaining a foothold in economic 
unions, protecting domestic markets, protecting foreign markets, and acquiring tech-
nological and managerial know-how.  
 3   While there is a great amount of FDI made every year, most of it (approximately 80 per-
cent) occurs within or between triad countries. Much of the remaining FDI is in countries 
that are members of triad-based FDI clusters.  
 4  The triad nations dominate world trade and investments, and a great deal of this activity 
takes place both among and within triad countries. One of the major areas of triad trade 
is automobiles, which provides an excellent example of the economic interrelationships 
that exist among triad members.

CHAPTER 3 THE TRIAD AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 REAL CASE 
 Panasonic and Philips 
 In terms of triad-based competition, the 1980s saw the 
emergence of Japanese firms in the consumer electronics 
industry. One of the major companies is Panasonic, which 
was formerly known as Matsushita. The firm was initially 
successful with color TVs, but its best-known product has 
been the video cassette recorder (VCR), a field it dominates 
by using the VHS system instead of the Sony Betamax for-
mat VCR and others produced by European and US rivals. 
Paradoxically, the VCR was developed in California in 1956 
by a US firm, Ampex, but the product development and 
distribution was captured by the clever global strategy of 
Matsushita/Panasonic. 
 To dominate world business in VCRs, by that time, 
Matsushita managed to make the VHS format the industry 
standard. The company achieved this not just by its own 
massive production and worldwide sales, but by licens-
ing the VHS format to other MNEs such as Hitachi, Sharp, 
Mitsubishi, and even the major European-based rival, 
Philips. Other companies such as GE, RCA, and Zenith 
(which sold VCRs under their own brand names) were tied 
into the VHS format because of the production and process 
technology retained by Matsushita in its strong Japanese 
home base. The company’s massive global economies of 
scale enabled it to cut VCR prices by 50 percent over its 
first five years. 
 In contrast, Philips was in desperate trouble by the 
1980s. Built up in the interwar period of protectionism and 
strong government regulation, the company had devel-
oped a very highly decentralized organizational structure. 
Individual national country managers held the power in 
Philips, and they were slow to respond to the Japanese 
threat in the postwar period. As a result, Philips lacked 
economies of scale and its radios, TVs, and VCRs were too 
expensive compared to comparable Japanese products. 
Philips had more than 600 manufacturing plants across the 
world, all developing products for local markets. However, 
the challenge facing the firm was how to restructure its 
entire business away from locally responsive national 
organizations toward a more integrated and leaner manu-
facturer capable of reaping the necessary economies of 
scale through standard global production. 
 In essence, the Japanese changed the rules of the 
game in the consumer electronics business. Matsushita/ 
Panasonic, as a centralized, high-quality, low-price, and 
innovative company, was able to beat the decentralized 
and nationally responsive European firm. One tactic used 
by European firms was to lobby their governments for 
protection in the form of antidumping actions and tougher 
customs inspection of Japanese products. But such “shel-
ters” only bought some breathing room before MNEs such 
as Philips restructured and fitted their organizational 
capabilities to the required industry strategy. 
 Finally, the response of Matsushita/ Panasonic to more 
protection has been to switch overseas sales from export 
to foreign direct investment (FDI). With FDI the firm has 
been able to evade European trade barriers such as anti-
dumping actions. For example, today it manufactures in a 
number of European countries including the UK, where it 
has a major plant in Cardiff, Wales. At the same time this 
means that Matsushita/Panasonic must make its foreign 
subsidiaries as effective as possible by encouraging local 
initiatives, and this strategy can conflict with its inter-
nationally centralized Japanese-based management cul-
ture. In short, the very government regulations that have 
made Philips too decentralized are now being reapplied 
half a century later to make Matsushita/Panasonic less 
global and more local.

PART ONE THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 REAL CASE 
 Toys “
R
” Us opened its first international outlet in Canada 
in 1984, and then it moved to parts of Europe, Hong Kong, 
and Singapore, where the company’s “discount formula” 
was as popular as in the United States. The international 
business model applied to new markets was the same as 
that used by the company in the United States: the stores 
resembled each other, and each store had a self-service 
supermarket format that offered a great variety of toys sold 
at low prices. 
 By 2009, 722 Toys “
R
” Us stores were located outside the 
United States, of which Europe 287, Asia 255, Canada 69, 
Middle East 52, Australia 35 and Africa 24. Yet, entering a 
new market has not always been easy for the company. As 
this case shows, cultural differences and regulations can 
make establishing a foreign business model very difficult. 
 Toys “
R
” Us in Germany 
 Many multinationals like to set up operations in Europe, 
particularly in the largest economy, Germany. Despite its 
economic downturn in the 1990s, this country has a very 
strong economy, and it greatly influences what happens in 
the rest of the EU. 
 When Toys “
R
” Us decided to enter the German market, it 
was greeted by a partial boycott and a public relations blitz 
that condemned the concept of a self-service toy super-
market as being alien and wrong. Even though the manag-
ing director of Toys “
R
” Us was German, strong objections 
were directed against a US retailer wanting large-area 
sales space in Germany. The company soon learned that 
legal and cultural barriers could be effectively used to 
block foreign competition. When Toys “
R
” Us applied for a 
construction permit in Cologne, the city fathers asked the 
local chamber of commerce and retailers’ association how 
they felt about the application. The latter replied that a toy 
store belongs in the center of the city, not on the edge of 
town. Yet this is exactly where Toys “
R
” Us needed to be 
located so that it could build a sprawling store and a park-
ing lot that was the size of a football field. In addition, the 
German Toy Manufacturers Association questioned why a 
toy store would sell so many non-toy items.  
 The managing director for Toys “
R
” Us refused to allow 
these early setbacks to thwart his efforts. He continued 
making the rounds of trade shows, negotiating for store 
sites, and presenting the company’s plans to local officials; 
eventually he wore down the resistance. Even the compe-
tition began to realize that successful large toy stores 
could spark a boom in the toy market. Soon, competitors 
began copying some of the approaches used by Toys “
R
” 
Us, such as piling shelves at the back of the store with baby 
food and diapers. Parents who come in to get diapers or 
baby food seldom leave without buying a toy for the child. 
 The German experience has taught the management 
that despite cultural, legal, and technical barriers, a retail 
company can succeed in Europe if it is patient, maintains a 
strong consumer-oriented marketing focus, and is nation-
ally responsive. 
 By 2009, Toys “
R
” Us had 57 stores in Germany. It had 
another 287 outlets in Europe, including 75 in the UK, 39 in 
France, and 45 in Spain.  
 Toys “
R
” Us in Japan 
 The Japanese toy market is one of the largest, making it 
an attractive market for Toys “
R
” Us. Yet, when the firm 
decided to enter this market in 1991, it had some major 
hurdles to overcome. Despite the rapid growth it had 
experienced, Japan’s toy industry remained highly frag-
mented and locally focused. Japanese reportedly preferred 
personal attention from the shop owner rather than low 
prices. In addition to customers’ habits and personal loyal-
ties, Japan’s retail structure was also bolstered by a series 
of laws restricting the spread of larger retail stores. 
 At the time, a typical Japanese toy store was less than 
3,200 ft 2  (300 m 2 ) in area. Nearly all retail shops were domes-
tically owned and bought their toys from local wholesalers, 
usually for 75–80 percent of the manufacturer’s “suggested 
price.” Retailers then sold the toys for the suggested price, 
deviating from it only rarely. Fragmented wholesalers 
served these shops. These wholesalers sold their prod-
ucts through a complex distribution system that typically 
involved between three and five layers of intermediaries. 
 The Toys “
R
” Us business model clashed with tra-
ditional business structures. Its self-serve format put more

attention on lower prices, minimizing personal attention 
to each customer, and cutting out any intermediaries from 
the supply process. Japan not only presented great possi-
bilities but also involved a high risk of failure, especially if 
the company didn’t adapt its business model. 
 To overcome the problems of Japanese culture and 
history being incompatible with the Toys “
R
” Us business 
model, Den Fujita, who had successfully run McDonald’s 
Japan, was enlisted as a local partner. At the time, he was 
the only Japanese business leader who had succeeded in 
bringing foreign non-luxury retail business into the restric-
tive Japanese market. His experience, political influence, 
vision, and unique understanding of both Japanese and US 
cultures enhanced the probability of success of Toys “
R
” 
Us in Japan. 
 With the help of Fujita, a powerful opinion leader who 
affects government policy making, and a younger gen-
eration that had started to realize that they were paying 
inflated prices for many consumer goods, many commercial 
restrictions were lifted, and Toys “
R
” Us was able to imple-
ment a business model similar to that in the United States. 
As of 2009, Toys “
R
” Us had 167 stores in Japan.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Politics and economics are closely linked and often affect each other. 
A good example is the economic changes that are sweeping Eastern 
Europe and Asia today. As these countries embrace open markets, 
their centrally planned economies are giving way to market-driven 
economies. However, this latter development would have been 
impossible had it not been preceded by the requisite political change 
as reflected by more democratic governments. The purposes of this 
chapter are to examine the linkage between political forces and 
economic change and then to review some of the major forms of 
economic integration that are being used to create regional trade 
areas and common markets. In future chapters these topics will be 
developed in more depth. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Compare  and  contrast  major political and economic systems and 
note the linkage among them.  
 2  Examine  the primary reasons for the current privatization 
movement and the economic impact that this movement is having 
on selected countries.  
 3  Describe  the five major levels of economic integration and how 
each works.  
 4  Discuss  how MNEs are using strategic planning to benefit from 
current worldwide economic integration efforts.  
 5  Discuss  the impact of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on 
international business.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Making investments in any foreign country is a risky busi-
ness. Each and every foreign country has a different set of 
legal, political, social, and economic institutions. Despite 
allegations that the world is flat, what we know is that 
there remains a large degree of variation in both country 
and regional institutional arrangements. Thus, no investor 
can afford to assume that doing business abroad is risk 
free. This logic applies to the current situation in Russia. 
 A number of problems continue to plague Russia. 
Natural resources account for 80 percent of the country’s 
exports, including oil and natural gas, making the economy 
susceptible to world price fluctuations. The banking sys-
tem is weak and, after the 1998 crisis, generally distrusted. 
In 2004, for instance, smaller banks faced a liquidity crisis 
as depositors, afraid for their savings, withdrew large 
sums of money. In addition, widespread corruption and 
government interference in the judiciary process stymies 
both domestic and foreign investment. A case in point is 
that of Yukos, one of Russia’s largest oil companies, whose 
privatization was one of many corrupt undertakings in the 
transition to a market economy. The government sought 
to collect back taxes that are threatening to bankrupt the 
company. Yukos is charged with tax evasion, but critics 
claim the move was politically motivated and that the tools 
used to evade taxes were perfectly legal under Russian law 
when they were undertaken.  
 By 2010, the former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky of Yukos was already serving an eight-year 
jail term for fraud and tax evasion. In the verdict of the 
second trial on December 27, 2010, he and his business 
partner Platon Lebedev were found guilty of stealing bil-
lions of dollars from their own oil firm, Yukos, and launder-
ing the proceeds between 1998 and 2003. They would have 
to stay in jail until 2017. Many critics believe the govern-
ment wants the former tycoon kept behind the bars for as 
long as possible because he challenged the former presi-
dent Vladimir Putin. As a result of this internal uncertainty 
foreign investors continue to reassess their opportunities 
in Russia. 
 It is being argued that such political events in Russia 
make it far too dangerous a place to do business. This is 
not an accurate assessment of the political and economic 
situation in Russia. The nationalization of key resource-
based companies and the perceived inappropriate treat-
ment of some foreign investors undoubtedly reflect an 
increase in Russian economic nationalism. However, this 
has not yet reached a significant level, nor is it likely to in 
the future. 
 The reason that Russian authorities will not engage 
in massive nationalization of foreign assets is that the 
Russian economy remains dependent on foreign invest-
ment. Russia has large supplies of energy resources, 
but it needs to sell these to foreign consumers. Russia’s 
resources will lose value if they are restricted to Russian 
consumers. There is as yet no economic evidence that 
Russia is seeking to be a self-contained, protected, and 
isolated economy. Instead, it relies upon trade and foreign 
investment. However, at a time of increased concern over 
energy security, Moscow has more 
than once reminded the rest of the 
world of the power it yields as a major 
energy supplier. In 2006, it cut gas to 
Ukraine (a pro-Western government 
by that time) after a row between the 
countries, a move that also affected 
the supply of gas to Western Europe. 
 Today Russia is the 10th-largest 
economy in the world. It is attracting 
large amounts of foreign direct invest-
ment from members of the European 
Union, especially Germany and the UK. 
In July 2007 the British government 
expelled four Russian diplomats from 
London. British Foreign Secretary, 
David Miliband, stated that this action 
was taken because the government of

CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
former President Vladimir Putin refused to extradite the 
Russian national suspected of the murder of Alexander 
Litvinenko in London in November 2006. In response, the 
Russians expelled four diplomats. In late 2010, a British 
MP’s Russia-born parliamentary aid was arrested over 
claims that she is a Russian spy. The latest allegations 
came after 10 Russian spy agents, including Anna Chapman 
who had dual Russian–UK citizenship, were expelled from 
the United States in July 2010. The Russian government is 
thought to have an “extensive shopping list of information” 
it is trying to acquire through covert means—on the aero-
space industry, defense, and information technology, as 
well as in politics and diplomacy. Despite this reversion 
to Cold War diplomacy it is not anticipated that British 
investment in Russia will decrease. Nor is it expected that 
London will stop being a second home for many wealthy 
Russian businessmen. In short, the British/Russian politi-
cal difficulties are unlikely to affect the growing economic 
relationships between the two countries.  
 In contrast to the British case, US political relations with 
Russia are more benign. The US government concluded a 
bilateral trade and investment agreement with Russia in 
November 2006. The United States is also helping Russia 
with its application to join the World Trade Organization. In 
general, US officials encourage US investment in Russia, 
and also welcome Russian investment in the United States. 
It is unlikely that the US government will take any action to 
offset its ongoing concerns about human rights violations 
in Russia or an increase in Russian economic nationalism. 
 This long-run analysis of why Russia will remain an 
integral part of the world economic system does not mean 
that specific investment projects can escape risk. Russia 
is still at an early stage of economic development. It is 
less than 20 years since the Berlin Wall crumbled and the 
former Soviet Union was opened to market forces. Russia 
has found it difficult to develop the appropriate market-
based institutions to match its acceptance of worldwide 
capitalism. 
 Instead, Russia remains an autocratic regime, and  foreign 
investors need to be careful in making commitments 
where the normal level and contractual arrangements 
available in the EU and North America do not yet fully 
exist. However, Russia is making progress on improving its 
institutional framework. In 2006 it hosted the annual meet-
ings of the G8 leaders, and its businesses are becoming 
increasingly aware that they must conform to the market-
based principles required by the WTO. 
 Today Russia is becoming increasingly integrated with 
the evolving EU (which now has 27 member states). 
Russia is also attracting investment from Japan and China. 
Investors need to adopt a long-term view and should not 
be thrown off by short-term political developments in 
Russia. Foreign investors should seek to build lasting per-
sonal relationships with Russia’s leaders in business and 
economics.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Over the past two decades, many countries have seen a dramatic change in their politi-
cal systems. In the Americas, both Chile and Nicaragua have returned to democracy. The 
former communist countries of Eastern Europe are building, in varying degrees, free mar-
ket systems. In China, meanwhile, the central government is still communist, but the nation 
is no longer tightly managed by Beijing. Market-driven companies have blossomed in a 
growing number of geographic areas (most of them in the south-eastern region), lending 
credence to the contentions of those who hold that China will be a market-driven economy 
within a few decades. Whether or not this proves true, one thing is certain: political and 
economic changes are taking place everywhere, opening up new opportunities for MNEs. 

106
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 In particular, the movement toward market-driven economies of countries that were 
once controlled by the former Soviet Union have affected international business. For 
example, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, to name 
but six, have all created market-driven economies. Years ago the former Soviet Union 
would not have permitted these satellite nations to abandon the command economy 
advocated by communist ideology and replace it with a free market system. Under Mikhail 
Gorbachev, however, the Soviet Union revised its political and economic thinking—and 
things have never been the same since. 
 Although this has proved to be good news for the satellite countries, Russia, as seen in 
this chapter’s Active Learning Case, has not been as fortunate. As a result, until MNEs feel 
that the government is willing to take the steps necessary to ensure that promises are kept 
and they are able to repatriate their funds, they are going to proceed very cautiously with 
their investment plans. International politics is a primary concern for these firms. This 
explains why Cuba has found it so difficult to attract foreign capital. 
 China, on the other hand, realizing that it must walk a fine line between commitment to 
its current political philosophy and the need to attract outside investments, has been trying 
very hard to balance both of these concerns. At the turn of the century, former President 
Jiang Zemin noted that one of the country’s primary economic objectives is to increase 
gross domestic product at an annual rate of 7 percent. During the interview, the president 
also said that capitalists should be welcomed into the Communist Party.       1  At the same 
time, China encouraged foreign capital investment in order to ensure that its economic 
engine continues to function efficiently—this implied a change in its political ideology. 
One development in this direction was a government announcement that the country 
could no longer ensure the survival of inefficient companies. Firms now have to be able to 
compete with MNEs or face the risk of going under. Workers, accustomed to job security, 
had to accept the fact that they could be laid off and be willing to be retrained in order to 
find employment in this new, competitive job market.       2  These reforms have come a long 
way. In 2005 the private economy accounted for nearly 40 percent of the gross product of 
Shanghai, China’s largest urban center. 3 
 These governmental decrees certainly represent a big change in the way things have 
been done in China for the past 50 years. The same is true worldwide. International politics 
and economic integration are altering the way international business is being conducted, 
and those nations that cannot keep up with these developments are going to find them-
selves falling farther and farther behind. In this chapter we will look at the major current 
economic and political systems and their impact on the world of international business. 
We will begin by examining political ideologies and economics. 
  Political ideologies and economics 
 An  ideology   is a set of integrated beliefs, theories, and doctrines that helps direct the actions 
of a society. Political ideology is almost always intertwined with economic philosophy. For 
example, the political ideology of the United States is grounded in the Constitution, which 
guarantees the rights of private property and the freedom of choice. This has helped lay 
the foundation for US capitalism. A change in this fundamental ideology would alter the 
 economic environment of the United States. The same is true, for example, for China and 
the former Soviet Union republics. Simply put, the political and economic ideologies of 
nations help to explain their national economic policies. 
 Political systems 
 In the extreme, there are two types of political systems: democracy and totalitarianism. 
 Democracy   is a system of government in which the people, either directly or through their

107
CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
elected ofﬁ cials, decide what is to be done. Good examples of democratic governments 
include the United States, Canada, the UK, and Australia. Common features of democratic 
governments include (1) the right to express opinions freely, (2) election of representatives 
for limited terms of ofﬁ ce, (3) an independent court system that protects individual prop-
erty and rights, and (4) a relatively non-political bureaucracy and defense infrastructure 
that ensure the continued operation of the system. 
 Totalitarianism   is a system of government in which one individual or political party 
maintains complete control and either refuses to recognize other parties or suppresses 
them. A number of types of totalitarianism currently exist.   Communism   is an economic 
system in which the government owns all property and makes all decisions regarding the 
production and distribution of goods and services. To date, all attempts at national com-
munism have led to totalitarianism. The best example of communism is Cuba. Another 
form of totalitarianism is   theocratic totalitarianism  , in which a religious group exercises 
total power and represses or persecutes non-orthodox factions. Iran and some of the sheik-
doms of the Middle East are good examples. A third form is   secular totalitarianism , in 
which the military controls the government and makes decisions that it deems to be in the 
best interests of the country. Examples of this are communist North Korea and Chile under 
Pinochet. Political systems typically create the infrastructure within which the economic 
system functions; in order to change the economic system, there often needs to be a change 
in the way the country is governed.                 
 Economic systems 
 The three basic economic systems are capitalism, socialism, and mixed. However, for the 
purposes of our analysis it is more helpful to classify these systems in terms of resource 
allocation (market-driven versus centrally determined) and property ownership (private 
versus public). In a   market-driven economy  , goods and services are allocated on the basis 
of demand and supply. If consumers express a preference for cellular telephones, more of 
these products will be offered for sale. If consumers refuse to buy dot-matrix printers, these 
goods will cease to be offered. The US and EU nations have market-driven economies. In a 
 centrally determined economy  , goods and services are allocated based on a plan formu-
lated by a committee that decides what is to be offered. In these economies people are able 
to purchase only what the government determines should be sold. Cuba is the best example.       
 Market-driven economies are characterized by private ownership. Most of the assets of 
production are in the hands of privately owned companies that compete for market share 
by offering the best-quality goods and services at competitive prices. Centrally determined 
economies are characterized by public ownership. Most of the assets of production are in 
the hands of the state, and production quotas are set for each organization. 
 In examining economic systems, it is important to remember that, in a strict sense, 
most nations of the world have   mixed economies  , characterized by a combination 
of market-driven forces and centrally determined planning. Mixed economies include 
privately owned commercial entities as well as government-owned commercial entities. 
Governments in mixed economies typically own the utilities and infrastructural indus-
tries—railroads, airlines, shipping lines, and industries considered to be of economic and 
strategic importance—for instance, petroleum and copper. For example, the United States, 
a leading proponent of market-driven economic policies, provides health care and other 
social services to many of its citizens through government-regulated agencies, which gives 
it some aspects of central planning. Other democratic countries with mixed economies 
include the UK, Sweden, and Germany, all of which have even stronger social welfare sys-
tems than the United States. 
 Another example of the role of government in the economy is that of promoting busi-
ness and ensuring that local firms gain or maintain dominance in certain market areas. The

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
US and EU governments continually pressure the Chinese to open their doors to foreign 
MNEs, and the Chinese government is very active in helping its local firms do business 
with the West. 
 As a result of such developments, there has been a blurring of the differences between 
market-driven and centrally determined economies. The biggest change has been the will-
ingness of the latter to introduce free market concepts. Examples include Russia and other 
East European countries, which began introducing aspects of free enterprise such as allow-
ing people to start their own businesses and to keep any profits that they make.       4  At the 
same time, however, many market-driven economies are increasingly adopting centrally 
determined ideas, such as using business–government cooperation to fend off external 
competitors, or the use of political force to limit the ability of overseas firms to do busi-
ness in their country. In the United States, for example, the government is frequently being 
urged to play a more active role in monitoring foreign business practices. An instance of 
this can be seen in the box  International Business Strategy in Action: Softwood lumber: 
not-so-free trade . On balance, however, we are now seeing a move from central planning 
to market-driven and mixed economies. The privatization movement that is taking place 
worldwide provides one prominent example.  
  Government control of assets 
 Over the past decade or so, an increasing number of countries have begun moving toward 
 privatization  , the process of selling government assets to private buyers. To understand 
the reasons for, and the economic impact of, this process, it is helpful to examine both the 
potential beneﬁ ts of government ownership and the advantages of moving to privatization.    
 There are six common, and sometimes interdependent, reasons for countries to control 
business assets, a process known as   nationalization  . These include (1) promoting econ-
omic development, such as by coordinating the assets of many businesses into one overall 
master plan; (2) earning profits for the national treasury; (3) preventing companies from 
going bankrupt and closing their doors; (4) enhancing programs that are in the national 
interest; (5) increasing the political or economic control of those in power; and (6) ensur-
ing goods and services to all citizens regardless of their economic status.       5 
 The opposite situation, privatization, can take two forms. The most common form is 
 divestiture  , in which the government sells its assets. The other is   contract management , 
in which the government transfers operating responsibility of an industry without transfer-
ring the legal title and ownership. The major trend today is toward divestiture.       
 Some of the primary reasons for privatization are: (1) it is more efficient to have the 
goods and services provided by private business than by government-run companies; (2) a 
change in the political culture brings about a desire to sell these assets; (3) the company has 
been making money, and the government feels there is more to be gained by selling now 
than by holding on; (4) the purchase price can be used to reduce the national debt; (5) the 
company is losing money, and the government has to assume the losses out of the national 
treasury; (6) the company needs research and development funds in order to maintain a 
competitive stance and it is unwilling to make this investment; and (7) international fund-
ing agencies are making assistance to the country conditional on a reduction in the size of 
the government. 6 
 Privatization in action 
 Many nations have privatization programs. 7  These include countries with moderate per 
capita gross domestic products, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and China, as well 
as economically advanced nations such as the United States, Japan, Germany, and the UK. 
All feel that their economies can be strengthened through privatization programs.

CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Softwood lumber: not-so-free trade 
 In 2003, both the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled in 
favor of Canada on the issue of US tariffs on Canadian soft-
wood lumber. The WTO ruling was non-binding, whereas 
NAFTA’s ruling had to be addressed within 60 days. 
However, the agreement, reached in principle between the 
two countries, is far from free trade.  
 The rift between producers on each side of the border 
is 20 years old, and in 1996 it led to an agreement: the 
United States–Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA), 
in which Canada restricted exports to the United States to 
14.7 billion board feet. At that time, Canadian producers 
claimed such a restriction cost them $480 million annu-
ally and 11,000 jobs. When the agreement came to an 
end in 2001, US producers quickly lobbied their govern-
ment to impose tariffs on Canadian producers. For its 
part, the Canadian government was hoping that the end 
of the SLA would lead to free trade. An investigation by 
the Department of Commerce determined that Canada’s 
provincial governments were illegally subsidizing lumber 
production and imposed a tariff of 19.3 percent that was 
later increased to 27 percent. 
 At the core of the dispute are differences in the systems 
of production in both countries. In the United States, most 
harvested timber comes from private lands and is auc-
tioned off to buyers. In Canada, provincial governments 
own the land and set cutting fees according to market 
conditions. US producers argue that government-set cut-
ting fees are below market prices and thus constitute a 
35 percent subsidy to the Canadian industry. 
 Softwood lumber is one of Canada’s most successful 
exports to the United States. In fact, Canadian producers 
had held a 35 percent market share prior to the tariff, and 
exports to the United States had grown considerably in 
the 1990s, particularly as a result of the lower Canadian 
dollar. In addition, note the Canadian producers, the US 
claim ignores the extra expenses that Canadian firms have 
had to pay for road building, replanting, and environmental 
protection. As a result, the Canadians argue that the tariff 
is nothing more than protectionism. 
 The negative effects of the tariff are now being felt in both 
countries. The fact that US consumers are paying 10 percent 
more as a direct result has so upset some industry groups 
that an association of US homebuilders, consumers, and 
contractors lobbied Washington to remove the tariff. Within 
a month of the tariff’s enactment, 10,000 industry workers 
had been laid off, a dozen mills were shuttered, and most of 
the plants were operating below capacity. By 2003, Canadian 
producers held about one-third of the US market. 
 Favorable verdicts from WTO and NAFTA courts have 
resulted in almost no benefit to the Canadian industry. Both 
courts agreed that the Canadian system amounted to a sub-
sidy to domestic producers; however, the WTO found that the 
subsidy was not enough to warrant retaliation from the United 
States, and NAFTA found that the tariffs that the United States 
imposed were excessive and miscalculated the subsidy by 
not taking into consideration market conditions in Canada. 
An agreement in principle in 2003 proposed the elimination 
of the 27 percent US tariff but reduced the amount Canadian 
producers can export to the United States without penalty. 
Canadian firms would only be able to capture 31.5 percent 
(down from 33 percent) of the US market and would have to 
pay $200 per each additional thousand board feet. The United 
States would return 52 percent of all tariffs collected since 
2001, just over $800 million, but US companies would receive 
the remainder. Provinces that follow the US market system, 
such as New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, would benefit from 
more market access. Perhaps the most important section 
of this managed trade agreement is that it prevents Canada 
from further pursuing resolution through the WTO or NAFTA.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 In the case of Argentina, for example, the government has now ended the nation’s 
phone monopoly and opened up the $10 billion market to outside investors. Previously 
the two telephone companies that monopolized all long-distance and local phone services 
had their territories firmly established, and neither could compete with the other. Now 
they can. Moreover, other telephone companies also have licenses to operate throughout 
the country. The Argentinean government believes that, as a result of privatization in 
this industry, competition will increase, phone rates will drop, and service will increase 
sharply. 8 
 In the case of the UK, privatization and deregulation have proven to be a national 
boon. A few years ago British Telecommunications began downsizing its operations so as 
to increase its competitiveness and profitability. The firm slashed 100,000 jobs, and crit-
ics said that privatization and deregulation were hurting the economy. However, just the 
opposite occurred. Many of the workers who were laid off began finding jobs with small 
telecommunications firms that were springing up throughout the country. At the same 
time, there was an influx of large foreign competitors such as AT&T, the giant US telecom-
munications company, and AB L. M. Ericsson, the Swedish telecom-equipment maker, 
which hired thousands of people. As a result, between 1990 and 1999 the number of jobs 
in the UK’s telecommunications industry increased, while prices decreased and service 
improved sharply.       9 
 Another major group of nations turning to privatization is Russia and the East 
European countries. At the grassroots in Russia, a market economy has begun to evolve. 
Despite the lack of national or local laws to guide them, hundreds of small factories and 
service businesses are now privatizing themselves, and enterprises are pushing ahead with 
Russian-style versions of leveraged buyouts, employee stock ownership plans, and private 
spin-offs. Many are also taking their old, outmoded operations and modernizing them. 
A good example is the Vologda Textile Enterprise Company. By significantly reducing its 
workforce and rebuilding the looms, the firm has found that it can sell all of the textiles it 
produces to buyers in the EU. 10 
 Privatization is not always a popular idea, and it is often part of election debates. 
Yet governments continue to assess the benefits of privatization against those of state 
ownership. Mexico and Japan provide two recent examples. Recently the Mexican 
government announced that it will privatize its two national airlines, Aeroméxico and 
Mexicana, on the hopes that it can provide cheaper service and compete with low-
cost service from the United States. 11  Despite opposition from civil servants and some 
political parties, Japan Post is set for a slow privatization process that is to culminate 
in 2017. 12  
 Government–business cooperation 
 The fact that governments are privatizing assets does not mean they are distancing them-
selves from business ﬁ rms. Both Japan and the EU have seen a large amount of business–
government cooperation that has been extremely beneﬁ cial to the business sector in these 
countries. 
  Japan and EU assistance 
 After World War II, the Japanese government began formulating plans for regenerating 
its economy. In this vein, it gave responsibility for implementing the country’s trade and 
industrial policy to the   Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) . The initial 
focus of the ministry was to provide protection to Japanese companies and to assist in 
marketing the products of four major industries: electric power, steel, shipbuilding, and 
fertilizers. Incentives were created to encourage investment in these industries and to help

ﬁ rms export their products. In recent years, MITI’s focus has been on targeting less energy-
intensive industries for Japanese investment and growth. Prime examples include com-
puters and chemicals, where MITI works cooperatively with Japanese businesses to help 
ensure success. The focus of MITI has changed from a proactive to a much more cooper-
ative agency; its main role today is funding export markets for Japanese businesses. 
 Governments in the EU have also been very helpful in promoting businesses. One way 
has been to fund research consortia through research and development (R&D) support. 
One of the research programs that has been helped by EU governments is Research on 
Advanced Communications in Europe (RACE). Since the late 1980s, RACE has received 
billions of euros of government money to support its efforts in developing an integrated 
broadband telecommunications network. Another recipient of government largesse is 
the European Strategic Program for R&D in Information Technology (ESPRIT II). This 
consortium has engaged in hundreds of projects dealing with such high-tech areas as infor-
mation technologies, microelectronics, and computer-integrated manufacturing. Perhaps 
the best-known R&D consortium is EUREKA, a pan-European group whose main objective 
is to create closer cooperation between private companies and research institutes in the 
field of advanced technologies for the purpose of exploiting commercial opportunities. 
The projects that are funded bring together companies throughout the EU and involve 
not only large firms but also small and medium-sized enterprises. Unlike many research 
consortia, however, EUREKA focuses on projects whose research is now ready to be 
applied. 13 (See the Active Learning Case: Boeing vs. Airbus in  Chapter 3 for a closer look 
at government-established consortia.)  
 US competitiveness 
 The results of such governmental efforts have not been lost on Washington, which has long 
recognized the value of an industrial policy that provides beneﬁ ts similar to those offered 
by MITI and EUREKA. As long ago as 1990, a special White House panel of experts from 
industry, academia, and the government released a list of 22 technologies that it deemed 
essential to US national defense and economic prosperity. Including composite materials, 
ﬂ exible computer-integrated manufacturing, and high-deﬁ nition electronic displays, the 
list was intended to guide the Critical Technologies Institute, created by Congress in 1990 to 
conduct long-range strategic planning and to work closely with the private sector in devel-
oping important technologies. 
 Over the past two decades in particular, the US government has been active in sup-
porting research consortia to help underwrite some of the costs associated with new 
technology development. A good example is Sematech, a consortium of 14 semiconductor 
manufacturing companies, which once received $100 million a year in subsidies from the 
US government to help shore up the chip-making equipment industry. By the mid-1990s 
these manufacturers were doing so well that Sematech’s board voted to end federal fund-
ing, and the group is now funded entirely by private money.       14  Another consortium that 
has received government assistance is the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, 
which has provided a host of important technology breakthroughs, including a method 
for hardening cutting tools by coating them with diamond film. A third has been the 
Microelectronics & Computer Technology Corporation, which has worked on advanced 
computing, software, and computer-aided design. 
 In the past, US administrations have supported research efforts that promoted indus-
trial competitiveness and technological leadership. This often took one of two paths: 
(1) the funding of military research that could then be used to create commercially useful 
products; or (2) the direct funding of research efforts by US firms. The technology policy 
of the Bush administration is to continue the US focus on maintaining a strong, high-tech 
military and a world-class computer information industry.

 What type of economic system now exists in Russia: market-driven, centrally 
determined, or mixed? 
 A mixed system currently exists. The country is moving away from a centrally determined 
economy, but there is a long way to go. As can be seen from the information in the case, 
the transition is causing a great deal of economic upheaval. This may even result in a 
regression toward some of the previously employed, centrally determined decision mak-
ing. However, the country is not going to go back to the old way of doing things because 
it has too much committed to its current course of action. In particular, any further IMF 
loans or assistance from the United States, Japan, or the EU will depend on how well the 
country is holding the line and trying to make its market-driven economy work. So a mixed 
economic system will remain in place; in fact, this is really the only path the Russians can 
take in rescuing their economy.   
 Economic integration   is the establishment of transnational rules and regulations that 
enhance economic trade and cooperation among countries. At one extreme, economic 
integration would result in one worldwide free trade market in which all nations had a 
common currency and could export anything they wanted to any other nation. At the other 
extreme would be a total lack of economic integration, in which nations were self-sufﬁ cient 
and did not trade with anyone. (The theory of these polar extremes will be discussed in 
 Chapter 6 .) 
 The concept of economic integration is attractive, but there are many implementation 
problems. In particular, it requires that the participants agree to surrender some of their 
national sovereignty, such as the authority to set tariffs and quotas. For example, if the 
United States and the EU agree to allow free trade of agricultural products, neither one can 
restrict the other’s right to export these commodities. So although free trade may lead to 
lower prices, those who are unwilling to give up the right to control goods being imported 
into their country may well be opposed to it. 
 A number of regional economic efforts have been undertaken over the past 30 years to 
promote varying degrees of economic integration. The most successful has been the EU, 
although less developed countries (LDCs) have also made integration efforts. 
  Trade creation and trade diversion 
 Before examining economic integration in more depth, it is important to realize that the 
agreement of countries to integrate their economies will bring about a shift in business 
activity. This shift can result in trade creation as well as trade diversion. 
 Trade creation   occurs when members of an economic integration group begin focus-
ing their efforts on those goods and services for which they have a comparative advantage 
and start trading more extensively with each other. For example, the United States and 
Mexico have an agreement that allows cars to be assembled in Mexico and shipped to the 
United States. As a result, Mexico, a low-cost producer, supplies a large number of vehicles 
sold in the United States, and both countries prosper as a result.

CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
 Trade creation results in efficient, low-cost producers in member countries gaining 
market share from high-cost member producers, as well as generating increased exports. 
In fact, a growing number of US companies have moved some of their operations to 
Mexico or hired Mexican firms to be their suppliers because this is a more efficient 
approach than making the goods in the United States. And when efficient regional pro-
ducers are able to offer lower-price and higher-quality output than their competitors, 
trade creation results. 
 Trade diversion   occurs when members of an economic integration group decrease 
their trade with non-member countries in favor of trade with each other. One com-
mon reason is that the removal of trade barriers among member countries makes it less 
expensive to buy from companies within the group, and the continuation of trade barriers 
with non-member countries makes it more difficult for the latter to compete. Thus, trade 
diversion can lead to the loss of production and exports from more efficient non-member 
countries to less efficient member countries that are being protected by tariffs or other 
barriers. Quite obviously, the creation of economic integration groups is beneficial only 
if trade creation exceeds trade diversion. Otherwise, the economic union impedes inter-
national trade.   
  Levels of economic integration 
 There are ﬁ ve levels of economic integration, which extend from simple economic trade 
arrangements to full political integration characterized by a single government. The follow-
ing examines each of these levels, beginning with the simplest. 
 Free trade area 
 A  free trade area   is an economic integration arrangement in which barriers to trade (such 
as tariffs) among member countries are removed. Under this arrangement, each participant 
will seek to gain by specializing in the production of those goods and services for which 
it has a comparative advantage and importing those goods and services for which it has a 
comparative disadvantage. 
 One of the best-known free trade areas is the   North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA)  , which currently consists of Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The 
United States and Canada created this free trade area with the US–Canadian Free Trade 
Agreement of 1989, and the arrangement has now been expanded to include Mexico.       15 
While trade diversion can occur under free trade arrangements, NAFTA has led to a great 
amount of trade creation. In fact, trade among the three members of NAFTA is nearly 
$1 trillion annually!       16 
 Customs union 
 A  customs union   is a form of economic integration in which all tariffs between mem-
ber countries are eliminated and a common trade policy toward non-member countries 
is established. This policy often results in a uniform external tariff structure. Under this 
arrangement, a country outside the union will face the same tariff on exports to any mem-
ber country receiving the goods. 
 Under a customs union, member countries cede some of the control of their economic 
policies to the group at large. None of the regional integration groups in existence today 
has been formed for the purpose of creating a customs union; instead, many of them have 
sought greater integration in the form of a common market or economic union. However, 
because of the difficulty of attaining this high degree of integration, some countries have 
effectively settled for a customs union. The Andean Community, which will be discussed 
shortly, is an example.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Common market 
 A  common market   is a form of economic integration characterized by (1) no barriers to 
trade among member nations, (2) a common external trade policy, and (3) mobility of 
factors of production among member countries. A common market allows reallocation of 
production resources, such as capital, labor, and technology, based on the theory of com-
parative advantage. Although this may be economically disadvantageous to industries or 
speciﬁ c businesses in some member countries, in theory it should lead to the efﬁ cient deliv-
ery of goods and services to all member countries. The best example of a successful com-
mon market is the EU, although this group has now progressed beyond a common market 
and is now focusing on political and ﬁ nancial integration. 
 Economic union 
 An  economic union   is a deep form of economic integration and is characterized by free 
movement of goods, services, and factors of production among member countries and full 
integration of economic policies. An economic union (1) uniﬁ es monetary and ﬁ scal pol-
icy among the member nations, including the same tax rates, and (2) has a common cur-
rency (or a permanently ﬁ xed exchange rate among currencies). Additionally, most of the 
national economic policies of the individual countries are ceded to the group at large. There 
are no true economic unions in the world, but the creation of a single currency, the euro, 
certainly moves the EU in this direction. 
 Political union 
 A  political union   goes beyond full economic integration to encompass a single government. 
This occurs only when countries give up their individual national powers to be united and 
led by one government. One successful example is the United States, which combined inde-
pendent states into a political union. The EU is now also on its way to becoming a politi-
cal union. The European Parliament, for example, is directly elected by citizens of the EU 
countries, and its Council of Ministers, which is the decision-making body of the EU, is 
made up of government ministers from each EU country.    
  Economic integration: an overall perspective 
 Before concluding our discussion of levels of economic integration, four points merit con-
sideration. First, a country does not need to pursue economic integration by starting with 
a free trade area and then working up to a common market or an economic union. For 
example, the UK was a member of a free trade area before deciding to leave and enter 
the EU. Simply stated, countries will choose the appropriate level of economic integration 
based on their political and economic needs. 
 Second, economic integration in the form of free trade typically results in a winning 
situation for all group members, since each member can specialize in those goods and 
services it makes most efficiently and rely on others in the group to provide the remainder. 
However, when a bloc of countries imposes a tariff on non-members, this often results in a 
win–lose situation. Those outside the bloc face tariffs, are thus less competitive with group 
member companies, and lose market share and revenue within the bloc. Among group 
members, however, increased competition often results in greater efficiency, lower prices, 
and increased exports to non-member markets. 
 Third, and complementary to the above, bloc members often find that their businesses 
are able to achieve   internal economies of scale   brought about by lower production costs 
and other savings. So if a company in France was only moderately efficient when producing 
1,000 units a week for the French market, it is now highly efficient producing 4,000 units 
a week for countries throughout the EU. The elimination of tariffs and trade barriers and

CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
the opening up of new geographic markets allow the company to increase production 
 efficiency. In addition, since factors of production in a common market are allowed to flow 
freely across borders, the firm may also achieve   external economies of scale brought 
about by access to low-cost capital, more highly skilled labor, and superior technology. In 
short, in-group companies can draw on resources in member countries to help increase 
efficiency. 
 Finally, in the short run, some bloc countries may suffer because other member countries 
are able to achieve greater efficiency and thus dominate certain industries and markets in 
the bloc. The adjustment period may last as long as a decade as these less efficient countries 
scramble to improve their technologies, retrain their workforces, and redirect their econ-
omies to markets in the bloc where they can gain and sustain an advantage vis-à-vis other 
members. In the long run, however, economic integration results in all bloc countries 
becoming much more efficient and competitive. 
 Despite the logic of free trade and economic integration, many   non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs)   criticize MNEs and international institutions. We now discuss these 
issues. See also the box  International Business Strategy in Action: Non-governmental 
organizations and political power . 
  Ethics, environment, MNEs, and the civil society 
 In December 1999, a coalition of NGOs and labor unions organized protests in Seattle that 
turned into riots, which hindered the launch of another round of the WTO. In July 2001, 
the violent riots in Genoa at the G7 Summit were another example of the work of some 
anti-globalization activists, mainly NGOs, attempting to prevent negotiations by world 
leaders. 
 The  civil society   is a group of individuals, organizations, and institutions that act 
outside the government and the market to advance a diverse set of interests, including 
opposition to global business. Demonstrations against trade and investment agreements 
are mainly composed of environmentalists, anti-poverty campaigners, trade unionists, and 
anti-capitalists that are either part of an NGO or trade union, or simply individuals that 
share their views. 17 The lack of a common front across these organizations has meant that, 
while some protestors are chanting and throwing roses, others are throwing rocks and 
charging at the police. The more extremist groups would like to see an end to multination-
als and international trade. More moderate demonstrators would like a transformation 
in the rules of trade with less developed nations, debt forgiveness, and better labor and 
environmental standards.       18  Protestors also have different agendas. Trade unionists from 
developed countries are concerned about the alleged loss of jobs due to globalization, 
whereas human rights NGOs are much more concerned with the situation of workers in 
less industrialized nations.  
 The success of the NGOs in criticizing businesses, especially multinational enterprises 
(MNEs), builds on less spectacular but consistent progress in influencing the environmen-
tal agenda of international organizations. The first notable success of environmental NGOs 
occurred in NAFTA in 1993 when the Clinton administration inserted two side agreements 
on environment and labor after the first Bush administration had successfully negotiated 
NAFTA over the 1990–1992 period. 
 The UNCED Rio Summit of 1992 reflected the agenda of environmental NGOs, 
leading to an agreement that sets commitments but which governments have been 
unable to deliver on. The Kyoto Summit in 1997 resulted in the standards for reduc-
tion of greenhouse gas emissions; again, however, important economies—most notably 
the United States—would not meet them because of the economic and political costs 
of doing so.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Non-governmental organizations and political power 
 When the topic of politics in the international business 
arena is discussed, one is likely to hear about such things 
as the impact of the government on international trade 
and the regulation of multinational enterprises (MNEs). In 
recent years another topic that has become more popular 
is the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that 
have been gaining an increasing amount of political power. 
 An NGO is a non-profit organization run by volunteers 
with a specific mandate at a local, national, or international 
level. As such, NGOs take a number of different forms. 
Some are very large, such as the environmental group 
Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and Amnesty 
International, whereas others are smaller and less well 
known. NGOs’ positions on international trade issues are as 
diverse as their mandates. For example, Oxfam, whose man-
date is the long-term alleviation of poverty, suffering, and 
injustice, does not oppose trade itself. Indeed, it considers 
“fair trade” a means to achieve development in poorer 
countries and promotes other organizations that engage in 
this type of trade. The Institute for Leadership Development 
actively seeks to promote trade and the development of 
entrepreneurial skills in poorer countries. The US NGO 
Consumers for World Trade points out that protectionism 
is equivalent to a hidden tax and actively lobbies for free 
trade. Environmental and animal rights NGOs, on the other 
hand, lobby their governments and international bodies 
for trade rules that protect the natural environment. For 
example, in December 1997 at the Kyoto Summit, NGOs 
were instrumental in getting standards for the reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions put into the agreement, even 
though the United States and other major economic powers 
refused to accept this standard because the technology was 
not available and the standard could not be met. 
 Protectionist or anti-trade, NGOs often grab the head-
lines. For example, the American Farm Bureau seeks 
to improve the financial well-being and quality of life for 
farmers and ranchers in the United States and opposes 
government policies to liberalize agricultural trade by 
reducing subsidies to US farmers. Yet other NGOs are 
more generally opposed to free trade and investment. In 
the 1997–1998 period, for example, NGOs were extremely 
effective in defeating the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investment (MAI). The MAI was designed to make it illegal 
for signatory states to discriminate against foreign inves-
tors and to liberalize rules governing foreign domestic 
investment among the members of the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development. NGOs contributed 
to riots in Seattle in December 1999 and violent clashes 
with the police in Genoa in July 2001. The NGOs influenced 
the Clinton administration to add two side agreements to 
NAFTA: setting up an environmental body in Montreal and 
a labor standard body in Dallas. In a nutshell, these NGOs 
managed to work outside the NAFTA agreement to get pro-
visions incorporated into the overall contract. In the pro-
cess, they showed that NGOs were becoming an important 
force in the international political arena. 
 Notwithstanding the variety of views emanating from 
NGOs, a select group is portraying MNEs as big, bad, and 
ugly. But is it an accurate portrayal? Starbucks, for instance, 
has been heavily criticized for not selling Fairtrade coffee, yet 
it directly pays farmers a price higher than that received by 
farmers involved in fair trading. Being the best-known brand 
in North America was enough to make it the target of NGOs. 
In general, MNEs improve the well-being of workers across 
the world while manufacturing goods and providing services 
that improve the quality of life of consumers around the 
world. Given their rise in popularity over the last five years, 
NGOs are likely to be the focus of continuing interest by both 
international business analysts and local voters.

 These recent events portray the gulf between the environmental agendas of NGOs and 
the economic drivers of global business. How do we explain the existence of this gulf?       19 
Basically, there is a traditional divide between the redistribution and equity concerns of 
NGOs and the economic and efficiency issues that drive business. Democratic govern-
ments in Western economies have incorporated these dual concerns in their political 
platforms, and, at least as part of a broader political package, voters have some say 
through the electoral process. 

117
CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
 Complementary to the NGOs’ perspective on international trade and investment is the 
intellectual failure of academic theory, in which the twin basic paradigms of economics 
and politics are found to develop explanations of today’s global economy and the nature 
of foreign direct investment (FDI). In economics, the traditional efficiency-based neo-
classical paradigm (with its associated theory of comparative advantages and the overall 
country gains from free trade) is unsuitable as an explanation of FDI. Despite the efforts 
by international business writers over the last 30 years to develop a modern theory of the 
MNE, most economists are unable to accept this explanation of the reasons for FDI. As 
a consequence, the GATT and WTO have developed institutional frameworks to deal 
with the “shallow” integration of tariff cuts, but have failed to deal with the “deep” integra-
tion of FDI. 
 Related to the out-of-date economics paradigm of free trade is the political science focus 
on the nation state. Despite minor modifications to nation state paradigms, such as to 
incorporate subnational units in decision making, there is a limited buy-in to the alterna-
tive international political economy (IPE) viewpoint. Indeed, there is another unfortunate 
parallel between economics and political science in that both sets of work on the role and 
power of the MNE have failed to change the out-of-date thinking of the majority of aca-
demics, despite the abundant evidence of the relevance of MNEs and the global economic 
and political systems of today. The NGOs have slipped into this vacuum with their view of 
MNEs as big, bad, and ugly. The NGO thinking is now more influential with governments 
in North America and Europe than is the work of serious academic scholars working on 
MNEs. 20 
 The issue here is one of process. There is an “administrative heritage” of ideas. Today’s 
media are poorly trained in economics, politics, and international business. Those few 
who have any training are usually victims of the out-of-date paradigms of traditional 
economics and political science, which cannot explain FDI and the MNEs. The MBAs 
of business schools, who are now exposed to the new thinking on MNEs, are in business 
rather than the media. The professional intermediaries, such as management consultants, 
focus on their business or government clients rather than the media, and their very skills 
of confidential advice and in-house retraining make them poor advocates compared to the 
NGOs. Finally, the civil service is basically useless in dealing publicly with anti-trade NGOs 
as bureaucrats attempt to support and influence ministers and other officials rather than 
entering into the public forum. This institutional failure of academics, consultants, and 
bureaucrats to prepare a credible case for initiatives such as the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investment (MAI) and be able to debate it publicly leaves the field open to NGOs. 
 During negotiations for the MAI, Canadian anti-globalization activists equated 
NAFTA’s  Chapter 11  provisions with investor protection mechanisms under MAI. 
 Chapter 11  allows a company to sue national governments in trade matters that contravene 
NAFTA’s principles. The provision had been used by Ethyl, a US company, to overturn a 
Canadian import ban on MMT, a gasoline additive that was deemed a health hazard. The 
Canadian Minister of the Environment could have averted litigation by banning the pro-
duction of MMT as an environmental hazard, an internal matter subject to national law, 
but she ignored the advice of her bureaucrats and applied trade measures that came under 
the NAFTA. Several subsequent NAFTA  Chapter 11  cases have been resolved on technical 
grounds with no loss of sovereignty to host nations in their environmental policies. The 
MAI had similar provisions to protect investors, which led to it being labeled a “NAFTA 
on steroids” by anti-globalization activists. 
 The late Edward Graham has exploded the myth that anti-global activists defeated 
the MAI. 21  Graham concludes that the draft MAI was a very weak document. In fact, the 
investment liberalization being negotiated in the MAI was so weak that the US business 
community stopped supporting it long before anti-global activists started to protest against 
it in Paris. There was also a lack of leadership by the US government, tepid support in the 

118
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
EU, and eventually hostility to the MAI by the French government of Lionel Jospin, who 
was dependent on left-wing “green” support in his political coalition. 
 Perhaps what the MMT case really illustrates is the “dialogue of the deaf” taking place 
between trade experts and activists. The latter used the MMT case in a general assault on 
the MAI and on subsequent international trade and investment liberalization initiatives 
at the WTO and G7 Summits. Graham argues that, as a consequence, the environmental 
NGOs missed the boat. He states that trade negotiators were open and willing to incor-
porate environmental concerns into the MAI but that violent opposition to it has now 
closed the window for cooperation between NGOs and governments. 
 Any more Seattles and Genoas, with the attendant violence, however, will probably 
alienate the general public from the anti-capitalist agenda of the more extreme anti-global 
activists. This small and over-publicized section of the NGO movement, with its apparent 
opposition to reforming global governance mechanisms, continues to protest violently 
against MNEs. Eventually, the most serious NGOs, such as WWF and Oxfam, must disas-
sociate themselves from these violent activists in order to push forward a more sensible 
cooperative reformist agenda for civil society.  
  The European Union (EU) 
 After World War II, Europe needed to be rebuilt and economic cooperation among these 
countries was paramount. One of the earliest and most successful cooperative endeavors 
was the 1952 creation of the   European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)   for the pur-
pose of creating a common market that would revitalize the efﬁ ciency and competitiveness 
of these industries. Six countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
and West Germany) created the ECSC, and its success set the stage for the creation of what 
would eventually become the European Union.  
 Formation 
 The foundation of the European Union was laid in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome. The six 
nations that created the ECSC were the original founders of what was initially called the 
European Economic Community (EEC) and later the European Community (EC). By 
1991 six other nations had joined the EC (the UK, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, 
and Spain)—and in 1995 with the admission of Austria, Finland, and Sweden, the EC was 
renamed the   European Union  . In 2004, 10 new members joined the EU: Cyprus, Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In 
2007 Bulgaria and Romania joined. Today the EU is a major economic group, and a grow-
ing number of countries have applied for admission.       22  The main provisions of the founding 
treaty of 1957 were:  
 1   Formation of a free trade area among the members would be brought about by the 
gradual elimination of tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers.  
 2   Barriers to the movement of labor, capital, and business enterprises would eventually be 
removed. 
 3  Common agricultural policies would be adopted. 
 4   An investment fund to channel capital from the more advanced regions of the bloc to 
the less advanced regions would be created.  
 5   A customs union characterized by a uniform tariff schedule applicable to imports from 
the rest of the world would be created.   
 Some of the countries that were not members of the initial EEC felt that the objectives 
of this group went beyond what they were willing to do, but they did feel that a free trade

agreement would be good for their own economies. As a result, these nations formed the 
 European Free Trade Association (EFTA)  , whose primary goal was to dismantle trade 
barriers among its members. Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, 
and the UK were the founding members. In time the distinctions between EFTA and the 
EC blurred, however, and some of the members (Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, and 
the UK) eventually joined the EC. Moreover, in 1992 EFTA signed a treaty that formally 
gives its members an economic association with the EU. Today EFTA members include 
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.  
 Growth and challenges 
 Over the years, the EU has made vigorous headway in pursuit of its objectives. For example, 
during the 1970s formal barriers to the free flow of labor and capital were gradually 
dismantled. The  Single European Act (SEA) , which effectively prevents a country from 
vetoing any EU decision it deems to be in conﬂ ict with its vital interests, was enacted in 
the 1980s. In the past this veto power had often been used by EU members to protect their 
respective economic advantages, making it difﬁ cult for the group to make decisions.  
 Other major breakthroughs are occurring in the political and financial areas. With the 
EC 1992 measures, the EU has transformed itself into a political, economic, and monetary 
superpower that can speak with one powerful voice about everything from interest rates to 
defense. By moving in this direction, the EU political leaders negotiated and implemented 
a method for ratifying two new treaties that would extend the community’s powers from 
their present largely economic role to foreign and security policy and monetary affairs 
and, eventually, to defense.       23  The EU’s integration is now consolidating its financial and 
monetary system, which will facilitate the free flow of capital. Recently, a single European 
currency, the euro, was introduced to replace national currencies. Closely linked to this 
was the establishment of a central European bank that regulates the money supply and is 
thus able to stabilize interest rates throughout the EU. The effect of these actions may well 
be the creation of a “United States of Europe.” 
 However, the EU still faces a number of problems. One is disagreement among the 
members regarding the relationship that should exist between the community and the rest 
of the world. A second problem is the protection that countries give to their own indus-
tries, which is in direct contrast to the spirit of EU rules. A related area is the community’s 
agriculture policies, which provide subsidies and rebates to farmers and have resulted in 
charges of unfair trade practices. A third problem is the disagreement among the members 
regarding the amount of protection that poorer countries should be given before all trade 
barriers are dismantled. Even if all goals are not fully attained in the next decade, the EU 
is going to be an increasingly powerful economic force in the international arena. A close 
look at the community’s organizational arrangement helps to explain why.  
 Organization 
 The major institutions managing the EU are: the European Council, the Council of the 
European Union, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of 
Justice, and the Court of Auditors. (See  Figure   4.1   .) A brief description of each of these is 
set out below. (This predated the potential adoption of a quasi Constitution in late 2007, 
under which an EU president would be appointed.) 
 The  European Council   is composed of the heads of state of each EU member country as 
well as the president of the European Commission. The Council meets at least twice a year, 
and each head of state is typically accompanied to these meetings by a foreign minister. 
The purpose of the meetings is to resolve major policy issues and to set policy direction.  
 The  Council of the European Union   is the major policy decision-making body of the EU. 
Decisions are conducted by the relevant ministers from each country. If the environment is

on the agenda, the 27 environment ministers from each EU country will compose the coun-
cil. This body is responsible for all final EU decisions, except for the budget.   
 The  European Commission   has 27 members who are chosen by agreement of the 
member governments. Each country presently has one member. After Bulgaria and 
Romania have joined the union, the number of members will be decreased, and a rotation 
will be introduced so that not all countries will have representation at a given time. The 
Commission, the executive branch of the EU, handles a great deal of the technical work 
associated with preparing decisions and regulations. The group is responsible for drafting 
legislation for proposal to the Council of the European Union, overseeing the implemen-
tation of EU policies, and carrying out studies on key policy issues.  
 The  European Parliament   currently has 785 members elected directly by the voters 
in each member country. The Parliament serves as a watchdog on EU expenditures in 
addition to evaluating other decisions of the Council. More recently, the power of the 
Parliament has been expanded; it now has the right to vote on the appointment of com-
missioners as well as to veto matters related to the EU budget and single-market legislation.  
 The  Court of Justice   has one judge appointed from each EU member country and 
serves as the official interpreter of EU law. In most cases this requires the judges to rule 
on the meaning or application of the Treaty of Rome, based on the actions of member 
countries, companies, and individuals. The Court of Justice has supremacy over national 
law, and as a result it is increasingly being used as a court of appeal over national decisions.  
 The  Court of Auditors   has one judge appointed from each EU member country and 
is responsible for ensuring that revenues and expenditures are implemented lawfully in 
accordance to the budget.  
 The future 
 The EU is a powerful economic union. Empirical studies show that the community has 
created much more trade than it has diverted from the rest of the world. Moreover, this 
market has a greater combined gross domestic product than either of the two other triad 
major markets: North America and industrialized Asia. At the same time it is likely that 
EU-generated projects will offer major competition to other worldwide industries. For 
example, Airbus, as seen in  Chapter 3 , is now a major force in the world aircraft manufac-
turing industry. Quite clearly, the EU promises tremendous economic gains for member 
countries.

CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
  Other examples of economic integration 
 While the EU is the most successful economic union, there are a host of others. The follow-
ing brieﬂ y examines four of these. 
 Andean Community 
 The  Andean Community   is a customs union that was formed in 1969 with the signing of 
the Andean Pact by Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Venezuela was a member 
from 1973 to 2006, and Chile has withdrawn but remains an associate member country 
( www.comunidadandina.org ). The union is also known as Comunidad Andina (CAN) or 
Andean Community (Ancom). The original objectives of the CAN countries were to inte-
grate themselves economically, to reduce internal tariffs, to create a common external tariff, 
and to offer special concessions to the two smallest members, Bolivia and Ecuador. Initial 
restrictions that curtailed foreign investment led to Chile leaving the union. These restric-
tions have now been removed at the CAN level, but the legislation yields to individual 
national governments on the matter. Except for Peru, which is slowly removing its tariffs, 
the Andean Community is a customs union in which goods can travel free of duty among 
member states.  
 Mercosur 
 Mercosur   is a free trade group that was formed by Argentina and Brazil in 1988 to pro-
mote economic cooperation. Today the group has been expanded to include Paraguay and 
Uruguay, with Chile, Bolivia, and Peru as associate members. In 1995 the members agreed 
to a ﬁ ve-year program under which they hoped to perfect their free trade area and move 
toward a full customs union. However, things have not worked out very well in recent years. 
The group members have been unable to agree on a common agenda and each seems to be 
striking out in a different direction. For example, Argentina imposed tariffs on Brazilian 
televisions, shoes, and other goods; Brazil does not recognize Argentina’s food-quality 
standards; and external tariffs are often double charged. 24  In 2004, Mercosur and the 
Andean Community agreed in principle to work toward a “South American Community of 
Nations” that will encompass 360 million people and a GDP of $1 trillion. First, however, 
these countries must resolve their differences. 25  
 ASEAN 
 The  Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)   was founded in 1967 and 
now includes Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. This economic bloc is different from most 
others in that the primary emphasis is not on reducing trade barriers among the members, 
although this has been done with the agreement on the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), 
but rather on promoting exports to other countries. Members have been particularly suc-
cessful in promoting exports to the Japanese market and to the EU. Until the late 1990s 
members of ASEAN experienced rapid economic growth, thanks in no small part to the 
efﬁ ciency and productivity of their members as well as to their impressive marketing skills.  
 FTAA 
 The  Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)   was relaunched in Quebec City in April 
2001. All the economies of North, Central, and South America, along with all Caribbean 
economies (except for Cuba), agreed in principle to start the FTAA in 2005. While the US 
Congress approved the CAFTA in July 2005, the larger FTAA is in limbo. One main problem 
is that Latin American countries are wary of entering the agreement if it does not involve 
the elimination of US agricultural subsidies. The US objective for the FTAA is to build on 
the framework of NAFTA, discussed in  Chapters 6  and  19  in detail.

 Would Russia benefit by gaining admission to one of the major economic 
unions such as the EU? Why? 
 Russia certainly would benefit by gaining admission to an economic union such as the 
EU. It could then take advantage of a wide variety of benefits, including free movement of 
goods and services across borders, trade creation, the possible development of internal 
economies brought about by the huge market that would then be available for Russian 
goods, and a strengthening of the nation’s currency. Of course, admission to the EU or 
one of the other major economic unions is unlikely to occur, at least within the next few 
years, as the country is not stable. However, it would offer a very big boost to the nation’s 
economy.   
 Strategic alliance 
 A business relationship 
in which two or more 
companies work together 
to achieve a collective 
advantage 
 How can MNEs use strategic management planning to beneﬁ t from worldwide economic 
integration efforts? A number of steps are proving to be helpful, particularly the use of 
strategic alliances, acquisitions, and the localization of business operations. 
  Strategic alliances and acquisitions 
 One of the most common ways of beneﬁ ting from economic integration is by creating a 
strategic alliance, often in the form of a joint venture, with other ﬁ rms that can provide 
important forms of assistance. The following examines the use of strategic alliances and 
acquisitions in the telecommunications and electronics industry and acquisitions in the 
brewery business. 
 Telecommunications and electronics 
 Over the past decade the telecommunications industry has been expanding in terms of 
both products and geographic coverage. This development represents the convergence of 
four distinct industries: telephone, mass media (print, broadcast, and cable), consumer 
electronics, and computers. The result has been a growing number of products and services 
such as cellular phones, personal computers, and televisions that are able to interact with 
each other in both receiving and transmitting information. In addition, the industry has 
become even more competitive and complex with the advent of wireless networks. In an 
effort to take advantage of these developments, a number of ﬁ rms in the industry are 
relying on strategic alliances. 26 
 A  strategic alliance   is a business relationship in which two or more companies work 
together to achieve a collective advantage. These alliances can take a number of forms. In 
some cases companies jointly conduct research or combine their efforts to market a prod-
uct. In other instances they will license a firm to produce and sell a particular product in 
a specific market region. In the telecommunications industry, strategic alliances have been 
very important because of the high investment and the need to attain market penetration. 
A good example is provided by Concert, which is a strategic alliance composed of AT&T 
and British Telecommunications. Concert provides voice and data telecom services to

MANAGEMENT

CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
multinational corporations and individual users through a network of distributors. It is 
also interested in increasing its global market presence, as seen by its decision to buy a 
30 percent stake in Japan Telecom.  
 Another example of a strategic alliance is provided by Lucent Technologies, which 
merged its consumer phone unit with that of Philips Electronics NV so that the two could 
produce a wide range of products, from corded and cordless telephones to answering 
machines to many types of digital cellular phones. This arrangement gave Philips’s con-
sumer phone business a strong boost while helping Lucent, which is very strong in network 
gear, high-tech chips, and software used in switches and phones, but which has been hav-
ing trouble in the face of stiff competition from European suppliers.       27 
 Yet another example is that of Microsoft and Sony, which teamed up to link personal 
computers and consumer electronics devices, thus moving closer together on technology 
standards for digital television and other consumer products. The two firms also endorsed 
a technology that can connect video cassette recorders, camcorders, personal computers, 
and other devices. Microsoft’s objective in this alliance was to license the networking tech-
nology software from Sony to use with versions of an operating system that it was trying to 
standardize for non-personal computer (PC) products. The objective of the joint venture 
was to create a technology by which consumers could plug a camcorder easily into a PC or 
television set-top box for sending video mail over the Internet.       28 
 Breweries 
 Not all strategic alliances and joint ventures involve giant multinationals. Many brewers 
have found, to their regret, that it is difﬁ cult to get customers to change brands. This is 
particularly true in countries such as Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands, where beer is 
popular. Customers are often ﬁ ercely loyal to local brands, and the only way of tapping into 
these markets is by purchasing the brewery. Major European brewers have long realized this 
and have not hesitated to buy operations in other countries. A good example is the purchase 
of La Cruz del Campo, Spain’s largest brewery, by the UK’s Guinness. However, the com-
pany has a long way to go before it will catch Heineken, which for years has been buying 
small brewers on the Continent, a strategy now being emulated by large US competitors. 
  Localization of business operations 
 MNEs cannot conduct business overseas in the same way they do at home. They have to tar-
get their offerings carefully to the needs of the regional and local customers. These efforts 
result in the localization of business operations and typically focus on four areas: products, 
proﬁ ts, production, and management. 29 
 Localization of products 
 The localization of products requires the development, manufacturing, and marketing of 
goods best suited to the needs of the local customer and marketplace. This typically requires 
the modiﬁ cation of products that have sold well in other geographic regions. For example, 
in North America buyers use motorcycles primarily for leisure and sports, so they look 
for high horsepower output and speed. In contrast, South-East Asians use motorcycles as 
a basic means of transportation, so they look for low cost and ease of maintenance; and 
in Australia, where shepherds use motorcycles to drive sheep, low-speed torque is more 
important than either high speed or ease of maintenance.       30 
 MNEs commonly localize production by investing in research and development, so they 
can make the product that fits the specific needs of that market. This is sometimes more 
difficult than it appears, especially if the MNE has been successful with a product in the 
home market and is unwilling to change. A good example is provided by the Whirlpool 

124
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
Corporation, which dominated the US market before going to Europe in the late 1980s. 
Believing that the giant $20 billion European appliance market with its dozens of margin-
ally profitable companies was on the verge of consolidation, Whirlpool wanted to be one 
of the major players. So it bought a majority stake in a struggling appliance operation 
belonging to NV Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, and acquired the rest of the operation 
two years later for $1.1 billion. Whirlpool believed that the European market was highly 
regionalized because there were so many diverse consumer preferences. For example, the 
Swedish liked galvanized washers that could withstand salty air; the British washed their 
clothes more often than many others, so they wanted quieter washing machines; and 
so on. Stoves provided even greater examples of product diversity. However, Whirlpool 
believed that the market was ready for product consolidation, and therefore lent its sup-
port to a “world washer,” a single machine that could be sold anywhere on the Continent. 
As product diversity was reduced, Whirlpool believed, the marginal producers would be 
driven from the market and its own share would climb. What the company found was that 
the European market was a lot more competitive than it realized. Sweden’s AB Electrolux 
and Germany’s Bosch–Siemens Hausgeraete GmbH proved to be excellent competitors. In 
particular, they revamped their factories and drove costs down sharply. They also began 
introducing new products that kept customers coming back. By thus appealing to local 
tastes, Electrolux and Bosch–Siemens managed to keep Whirlpool’s profits to a minimum, 
while preventing it from gaining market share. 31 
 Localization of profits 
 Localization of proﬁ ts   is the reinvestment of earnings in the local market. MNEs do this by 
taking their earnings and using them to expand operations, set up new plants and ofﬁ ces, 
hire more local people, and make the investment more self-sufﬁ cient. In the United States, 
for example, Honda started out with an initial investment of $250,000 and has gradually 
reinvested its US proﬁ ts. Today the company has almost $2 billion in its motorcycle, auto, 
and engine manufacturing plants in Ohio. At the same time it has reinvested almost 
$200 million in Honda Canada, a manufacturing plant making Honda Civics.  
 Localization of production 
 Localization of production   involves the manufacture of goods in the host market.       32 Many 
MNEs, upon entering a foreign market, handle this function by exporting from the home 
country. For a successful relationship, however, this is often only a short-run strategy and is 
eventually replaced by a local manufacturing base. 33 One strategy for localizing production 
is to increase the amount of local content in the product by making more and more of the 
subunits in the host country. The ultimate step, of course, is to produce the entire product 
locally. Honda, for example, decided back in the late 1980s to turn its Ohio auto manufac-
turing facility into a fully integrated, self-reliant entity. The plan involved a number of steps, 
including increasing the plant’s production capacity so that it would be able to turn out 
500,000 units annually and build them with at least 75 percent domestic content. In 2007 
Honda started to build a parts plant in Greenburg, Indiana, employing workers within a 
one-hour drive of the plant. In the process, Honda localized its production.  
 The same is true for Toyota. The company increased the capacity of its Georgetown, 
Kentucky, and Princeton, Indiana, plants and its Ontario, Canada, facility. It also began 
production of its Lexus SUV in Canada. It increased the production capacity of its 
Burnaston, England, plant and increased auto production in its Thailand factory, while 
negotiating with the government to build an engine factory in Tianjin, China.       34 
 Another way to localize production is to provide added value in operations by modifying 
the imported product and adapting it to local conditions and tastes. This approach is used 
when a product requires country-by-country (or regional) changes. Auto manufacturers,

CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
for example, take into account the terrain (unpaved roads require stronger underbody 
construction), the cost of gasoline (high costs often mean that the market wants smaller, 
more efficient cars), and which side of the road everyone drives on (right in the United 
States and Latin America; left in the UK and Asia). 
 The localization of production is often carried out in conjunction with a home-country 
partner which provides the plant and personnel, while the MNE is responsible for the initial 
product and the technology needed in assembling or modifying the goods. Sometimes, 
however, the MNE will own the entire operation and depend on local management to help 
run the organization.  
 Localization of management 
 There are a number of ways for MNEs to localize management. One is by encourag-
ing home-ofﬁ ce managers to learn the local culture and become part of the community. 
Research reveals that companies that staff their subsidiaries with older, mature senior man-
agers from the home country who are ﬂ uent in the local language are often more highly 
productive than MNEs that staff operations with younger, less experienced managers.       35 A 
second way of localizing management is by delegating authority to host-country managers 
and developing and promoting these employees wherever possible. This strategy helps to 
create a bond between the host- and the home-country management. As one MNE spokes-
person put it: 
 we have become convinced that good communication between management and labor, as well 
as delegation of authority, elevate the employees’ sense of participation in decision making. This, 
in turn, gives the employees a stronger sense of responsibility and motivation, which leads to 
improved productivity and maintenance of high-quality standards. 36

 Is Russia a good potential investment for Western business? Explain. 
 Arguments can be made on each side. Untapped natural resources and potential con-
sumer demand could provide billions of dollars of annual sales for investing companies. 
On the other hand, the economy is in terrible shape, and it is likely to take years before 
Russia begins to provide an acceptable return on investment for many current projects. 
One of the major reasons for getting in now, of course, is to try to gain a strong foothold in 
the market and effectively block future competition. If this should happen, those coming 
later would find slim pickings. However, this potential benefit is unlikely to attract many 
investors. Most are likely to conclude that the best strategy is to proceed with caution and 
wait for the current uncertainty and turmoil to settle.   
 1   Political ideologies and economic systems are interwoven. Democracies tend to have 
market-driven economies; totalitarian governments tend to have centrally determined 
economies. However, few nations fit totally into one of these two paradigms. Most 
use a mixed economic model such as that of the United States, which is mainly a

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
market-driven economy with some central planning, or China, which still relies on 
central planning but is moving to allow some degree of free enterprise.  
 2   Another current economic development is the trend toward privatization. Many 
countries are selling their state-owned enterprises. A variety of reasons can be cited 
for these actions. In most cases these are economic in nature, including (a) increased 
efficiency, (b) reduction in government outlays, and (c) generation of funds for the 
national treasury.  
 3  Economic integration is the establishment of transnational rules and regulations that 
permit economic trade and cooperation among countries. Effective integration brings 
about trade creation, although in some cases these efforts result in trade diversion. 
There are five levels of regional economic trade integration: free trade areas, customs 
unions, common markets, economic unions, and political unions. The most success-
ful examples have been the EU and the NAFTA. Some NGOs criticize such trade and 
investment agreements. 
 4   NGOs are an important new actor on the stage of international business, and MNEs 
need to take account of the civil society in their strategies.  
 5   MNEs use a variety of strategies to benefit from integration efforts. One is strategic 
alliances and acquisitions with which they are able to scale the economic wall and gain 
an inside position in the economic alliance or free trade area. Another is through the 
localization of operations by focusing on products, profits, production, and manage-
ment. MNEs typically use both of these strategic approaches.

 How environmental regulations can be used as trade barriers 
 With free trade areas evolving around the globe, many 
protected industries are now facing unwelcome compe-
tition. Free trade agreements generally include a principle 
of national treatment under which a country must treat 
all producers, domestic or foreign, equally. However, 
some seemingly neutral environmental regulations pose a 
greater burden on foreign producers than on their domes-
tic competitors. Thus, they act as trade barriers under the 
disguise of environmental regulations. 
 For example, while environmental groups lobby for news-
print to contain a determined amount of recycled material 
and domestic producers of newsprint support the regu-
lation, foreign newsprint companies, which have no recycling 
facilities in the host country, face a competitive disadvan-
tage. This is what has been called a “Baptist–bootlegger” 
coalition. During the US prohibition era, Baptists were 
opposed to alcoholic consumption on moral grounds, while 
bootleggers actually benefited from prohibition by the 
sale of illegal alcoholic beverages. Today, environmental 
groups and domestic producers often form coalitions to 
promote their respective interests. 
 In the newsprint case, the foreign company would have 
two options if it were to continue to supply material from 
its home country. It could either open recycling plants in 
the host country and transport pulp from its own country to 
be processed there so as to meet the environmental regu-
lations, or take the recycling material to its home country 
to be processed. Both alternatives would pose significant 
transportation costs to the foreign producer. 
 A similar case is presented by the Ontario Beer Can Tax. 
In the early 1990s the province of Ontario levied a tax of 
$0.10 on each aluminum beer can. The province argued 
that these cans were not environmentally friendly and that 
the tax was designed to encourage the use of refillable 
glass bottles. US producers of beer and aluminum cans 
contended that this was a protectionist move and that

the Ontario government was singling out the competition 
with its beer industry since it had no similar tax for soft 
drinks and juice cans. Moreover, research studies found 
that aluminum cans and glass bottles both have the same 
effect on the environment, and that 80 percent of all the 
cans were being recycled. They also found that the larger, 
heavier glass required more energy to transport than did 
the lighter aluminum cans.

Embraer vs. Bombardier
Bombardier and Embraer compete in the mid-size aircraft 
market, the luxury jet market, and the military aircraft 
market. In 2004, both companies announced plans for big-
ger aircraft. In the United States, 61 percent of all flights 
take off with a higher number of passengers than either 
of their aircraft normally accommodated. Indeed, analysts 
believe that there has historically been a lack of flexibility 
from the two largest players, Boeing and Airbus, in supply-
ing this category of aircraft.
In 1942 Joseph Armand Bombardier, a young Quebec 
mechanic turned industrialist, incorporated the world’s 
first snowmobile manufacturer, L’Auto-Neige Bombardier. 
Although he had great plans for his innovative transpor­
tation inventions, he could never have foreseen the course 
his company would take in the next 50 years. For the year 
ended January 31, 2010, Bombardier is one of the world’s 
top manufacturers of transportation products, including 
trains and aircraft, with yearly revenues of US $19.4 billion, 
with over 62,900 employees of 95 nationalities speaking  
20 languages in more than 60 countries.
Bombardier’s success is in no small part the responsi-
bility of Laurent Beaudoin, the formar CEO and the current 
chairman of the board who over 30 years has followed a 
strategy of market entry and product improvement through 
acquisition, instead of relying strictly on R&D. This strategy 
has been exemplified by Bombardier’s entry into the aero-
space industry with the acquisition of Canadair in 1986.
In 1991, Bombardier took a risk on the undeveloped mar-
ket of regional jets, which quickly paid off. Airlines could 
offer more short-haul flights at a more reasonable price at 
a time when airport hubs were overcrowded. Bombardier 
enjoyed a virtual monopoly on this airplane category until 
Embraer came along. 
The beginnings of Embraer are very different. Founded 
in 1969 by a Brazilian military dictatorship, Embraer made 
its name building high-quality military and civilian aircraft. 
The airplanes were so expensive, however, that no one 
wanted to buy them, and for years the company lost mil-
lions in revenue. Then in 1994 it was privatized and given to 
Mauricio Botelho to turn around. He has. In 1995, the com-
pany launched a family of regional jets that were warmly 
received by US and European airlines. By 2009, Embraer 
had about half of the market; its sales reached $5.409 bil-
lion. But there was declining sales for Embraer by about  
25 percent in 2009 compared to 2008.
Because direct subsidies by governments to domestic 
firms are illegal at the WTO, each company has attempted 
to obtain WTO approval on trade sanctions against its 
competitor in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Canada filed 
a complaint over Brazilian subsidies to Embraer. Brazil 
countered with its own complaint over Canadian subsidies 
to Bombardier. In total, there were four cases at the WTO: 
1	 WTO Dispute DS46: Brazil—Export Financing Programme 
for Aircraft (Complainant: Canada), 19 June, 1996.
2	 WTO Dispute DS70: Canada—Measures Affecting the 
Export of Civilian Aircraft (Complainant: Brazil),  
10 March, 1997.
3	 WTO Dispute DS71: Canada—Measures Affecting the 
Export of Civilian Aircraft (Complainant: Brazil),  
10 March 1997.

CHAPTER 4 INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
 4  WTO Dispute DS222: Canada—Export Credits and Loan 
Guarantees for regional Aircraft (Complainant: Brazil), 
22 January 2001. 
 Both countries were successful, and today they both 
have a green light to impose sanctions on each other. This 
is unlikely to happen, however, as it would strain bilateral 
relations between the two nations. Instead, both countries 
are seeking some form of a compromise. 
 Both companies argue that the other has an unfair 
advantage. Bombardier, argues Embraer, has access to 
top-of-the-line technology and low-interest loans from 
being located in an industrialized country. Embraer, argues 
Bombardier, has access to cheap labor and benefits from 
a weak currency. The initial WTO complaint was based 
on low-interest loans to Embraer customers by Proex, a 
Brazilian agency set up to promote exports. In addition 
to the price of an Embraer airplane being lower by about 
$3 million, its customers could save even more by getting 
one of these loans. Brazil’s complaint cited subsidies from 
the Canadian government to three small airlines as an 
incentive to purchase Bombardier airplanes. 
 Now that the WTO has ruled against both countries, instead 
of applying punitive tariffs, Brazil and Canada are seeking to 
negotiate an agreement. Both have amended their subsidies. 
In a market with increased competition for regional flights, a 
trade war must be averted. At stake are negotiations for the 
Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). Indeed, the airplane 
dispute highlights the difficulties facing countries from the 
developed North and the developing South. 
 There are several reasons why a trade war should be 
avoided. The regional jet sector is facing increasing compe-
tition pressure. Other companies are currently developing 
competitive products in the 40–100 seat category. These 
include the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd. 
(COMAC), a state-owned company in which China Aviation 
Industry Corporation (formerly known as AVIC 1) holds an 
interest, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (MHI, Japan), and 
Sukhoi Company (JSC) (Sukhoi, Russia). 
 The financial crisis of 2008 continues to significantly affect 
the civil aerospace industry as a whole. Worsening economic 
conditions and restricted credit availability translate into a 
high level of order cancellations and deferrals of aircraft 
deliveries. This has caused most of the original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs) to reduce their production rates and 
has reduced their profitability. As a result, the world airlines’ 
net loss is forecasted to be $2.8 billion in 2010, compared 
to a net loss of $9.4 million in 2009. The limited availability 
of aircraft financing seen during 2009 also contributed to 
restraining airlines’ ability to buy new aircraft in 2010. Given 
this climate and the planned production rate, Bombardier 
expects to deliver approximately 20 percent fewer commer-
cial aircraft in 2011 than in 2010. Bombardier’s sales fell for 
the year ended in January 30, 2010 by 2 percent compared to 
that of 2009. Embraer also witnessed its sales decline by 
25 percent in 2009 compared to the previous year’s sales.  
 1    How do factor conditions differ for Embraer and 
Bombardier? 
 2    How does the dispute reflect the difficulties in 
drafting the FTAA?   
 3    Why are governments involved in this trade dispute?   
 4    Why are Canada and Brazil hesitant to apply the 
punitive tariffs they were awarded?

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Places and people differ. The Japanese tend to be very polite, the 
Australians characteristically blunt. Red means “danger” or “stop” 
to the British, but in Turkey it signifies death and in China, good 
fortune. In France getting into a  grande école  tends to guarantee good 
job prospects whereas in Saudi Arabia the wealth and status of your 
family is far more important. 
 Patterns of global diversity and the implications of these differences 
have been studied from a range of perspectives, by sociologists, 
psychologists, anthropologists, and political scientists. Here we are 
concerned with how cultural diversity and related differences in the 
behavior, norms, and expectations of particular groups of employees, 
managers, colleagues, or customers affect management decision 
making and corporate organizations. After an introduction to the kinds 
of business contexts in which cultural differences do matter, this 
chapter will describe some typologies of national cultural differences 
and discuss the implications of these for international managers. 
     The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Define  culture and explain the factors that underlie cultural 
differences. 
 2  Show  where and why cultural differences matter to international 
managers. 
 3  Explain  a number of frameworks that help identify important 
cultural differences.  
 4  Examine  how firms can anticipate and cope with cultural 
differences.

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
 Despite being part of the same advanced, industrialized 
world, Kalamazoo (Michigan, United States), Stockholm 
(Sweden), and Milan (Italy) are worlds apart in many impor-
tant ways. Senior managers leading the merger between 
two pharmaceutical firms, Upjohn Company of the United 
States and Pharmacia AB of Sweden (with operations in 
Italy), came to realize how significant these differences 
were after the merger took place in 1995. 
 Swedes take off most of the month of July for their 
annual vacation, Italians take off most of August. Not know-
ing this, US executives scheduled meetings in the summer 
only to have to cancel many because their European 
counterparts were at the beach. As the more dominant US 
firm began to impose its way of doing things on the newly 
acquired European organizations, international relation-
ships became increasingly strained. 
 Neither the Swedes nor the Italians were happy with 
impositions such as the drug and alcohol testing policy 
brought in by Upjohn, or the office smoking ban. These 
clashed with local ways of doing things and the more infor-
mal work environment that these cultures prefer. Although 
Upjohn later relaxed many of these work rules, allowing 
some local practices and preferences to prevail, ill-feeling 
and a degree of resistance had already developed among 
European colleagues. 
 The additional bureaucracy and the command-and-
control style imposed by the Americans created more 
significant problems for the 34,000 employees and man-
agers in Pharmacia and Upjohn Company. The Swedes 
were used to an open, team-based style of management 
where responsibilities are devolved; managers are trusted 
and not strictly monitored or closely managed. Swedish 
executives also tend to build up a consensus behind big 
decisions, “getting everyone in the same boat” ( alla aer i 
baten ) rather than handing orders down the hierarchy. As 
a traditional US multinational, however, Upjohn was more 
used to strong leadership and a centralized command-
and-control structure. Its CEO, Dr. John Zabriskie, quickly 
created a strict reporting system, tight budget control, and 
frequent staffing updates, which clashed with the Swedish 
organization style. Swedish managers would leave meet-
ings disgruntled, having been overruled by US executives 
keen to push their vision of the merged company. 
 The Swedes’ own ways of doing things had already 
clashed with the Italian style of management, following the 
takeover of Farmitalia (part of Montedison) by Pharmacia 
in 1993. Italians are used to a distinctive division between 
workers (and their strong unions) and managers. Their 
steeper hierarchies contrast the more egalitarian Swedes. 
Italians also place a high value on families and will leave 
work to tend to sick relatives or help with childcare, which 
the Swedes frown upon. The addition of the Americans 
from Upjohn to this mix created further cultural confusion. 
Communication problems, beyond the obvious language 
differences, became a real barrier to honest dialogue. “You 
go there thinking you’re going to streamline the place,” 
said American Mark H. Corrigan, Pharmacia and Upjohn 
Vice President for Clinical Development, “and you leave just 
having added five pounds from some wonderful meals.” 
 These differences, many of them small but important 
at the local level, quickly began to have an impact on the 
overall performance of the merged company. In the months 
and years following the merger unforeseen inefficiencies 
and added costs began to undermine the potential syner-
gies of bringing together two such companies in the first 
place. At one level the problems amounted to things like 
canceled meetings, new organization demands (such as 
monthly report writing), and a general decline in staff 
morale. There were also unexpected difficulties integrat-
ing the IT systems across the various parts of the merged 
organization. These and other changes added an estimated 
$200 million to the predicted costs of the restructuring, 
taking the total cost to $800 million. Even more seriously, 
for a pharmaceutical company heavily reliant on its new 
drugs pipeline to survive, delayed product launches and the 
loss of key staff (including the head of R&D at Pharmacia) 
had a longer-term impact. “There was probably an under-
appreciation . . . of these cultural differences,” says Art 
Atkinson, former Vice President for Clinical Research and 
Development. 
 Particular problems resulted from the restructuring of 
the firm’s global R&D structure. Prior to the merger Upjohn 
owned well-known names such as Rogaine and Motrin and 
had annual sales of around $3.5 billion, but had a weak 
new product pipeline and slow sales growth compared 
to its larger competitors. Similar-sized Pharmacia had a 
more promising pipeline but weak distribution and sales in 
the US market, the world’s largest. These amounted to a 
strong rationale for the merger. Together they could chal-
lenge the financial power and the larger R&D programs of 
their competitors. However, integrating and refocusing the 
various parts of the new R&D structure became a major 
problem. Rather than place the R&D headquarters in the 
United States, Sweden, or Milan, a decision was made to 
establish a new and neutral London-based center for the 
R&D function. This simply added a layer of management

and a more complex matrix reporting structure, which 
further alienated key R&D personnel. 
 In 1997, after the stock price of the merged corporation 
had fallen significantly, CEO John Zabriskie resigned. 
Swede Jan Ekberg, the former head of Pharmacia, took 
over temporarily and began to rebuild aspects of the 
merged organization. 
 After acquiring a major part of Monsanto in 2000, 
Pharmacia and Upjohn became Pharmacia, which was 
then itself acquired by the US giant Pfizer in April 2003. 
This made Pfizer, according to its own Annual Report, the 
“number one pharmaceutical company in every region of 
the World.” 
 All this proves is that going global is hard work. Not all of 
these problems could have been foreseen, but a real lack 
of awareness of cultural differences did lead to many of the 
organization difficulties and people problems with a real 
impact on the bottom line.

 The number of workers employed by foreign-owned companies has grown signiﬁ cantly 
over the past 20 years as a result of the expanding activities of foreign afﬁ liates of MNEs 
around the world. For many people, both employers and employees, this has brought home 
the realities of globalization. An estimated 73 million people globally (including 24 mil-
lion in China) now work for foreign companies, nearly three times the number in 1990. 
Companies such as Motorola, General Motors, British Petroleum, and General Electric are 
among the largest private-sector employers in economies such as Malaysia and Singapore.       1 
 This growing multicultural workforce, part of the increasingly global patterns of 
exchange and interaction discussed earlier in this book, makes it more and more important 
to understand how people’s preferences, beliefs, and values differ. Understanding inter-
national cultural differences allows us to be aware of and adapt to the differences that 
matter for managers.  
 INTRODUCTION 
 Culture can be deﬁ ned as “the sum total of the beliefs, rules, techniques, institutions, and arti-
facts that characterize human populations” 2 or “the collective programming of the mind.” 3  
 Sociologists generally talk about the   socialization   process, referring to the influence of 
parents, friends, education, and the interaction with other members of a particular society 
as the basis for one’s culture. These influences result in learned patterns of behavior com-
mon to members of a given society.  
 WHAT IS CULTURE?

 The process of 
enculturation, or the

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
 As you can see, definitions of culture vary according to the focus of interest, the unit of 
analysis, and the disciplinary approach (psychology, anthropology, sociology, geography, 
etc.). This is significant in that studies of cultural differences adopt a specific definition and 
set of measurable criteria, which are always debatable. Research into culture and its impact 
in business and management studies is highly contentious and should not just be taken at 
face value, including the studies described below.  
 There is a strong consensus, however, that key elements of culture include language, 
religion, values, attitudes, customs, and norms of a group or society.  Table   5.1    shows how 
the world’s population is divided according to geography, language, and religion. 
 Language is perhaps the most important key to understanding culture in general and 
the specific values, beliefs, attitudes, and opinions of a particular individual or group. 
English is widely accepted as the language of business; many global institutions and com-
panies have adopted English as their official language. For many firms, such as Toyota, 
NEC, Hitachi, and IBM Japan, English-speaking ability is a prerequisite for promotion.       4 
However, any assumption that speaking the same language removes cultural differences is 
dangerous—it normally just hides them. Moreover, a reliance on English by British and 
American managers, and a lack of other language skills, can weaken their ability to empa-
thize with and adapt to other cultures. 
 Religion, linked to both regional characteristics and language, also influences business 
culture through a set of shared core values. Protestants hold strong beliefs about the value 
of delayed gratification, saving, and investment. The sociologist Max Weber, writing in 
1904, saw this Protestant work ethic as the “spirit of capitalism” during the Industrial 
Revolution. 5  Rather than spending, consuming, and enjoying life now, their religious 
beliefs prompted the Protestants to look to longer-term rewards (including those in the 
after-life). There are parallels with the Confucian and Shinto work ethics, which also 
view spiritual rewards as tied to hard work and commitment to the fruits of industry. 
Contrasting this, a more stoic attitude among some African populations partly explains 
their acceptance of the ways things are, because it is the “will of God” ( shauri ya Mungu ). 
 At the most general level culture can refer simply to the lifestyle and behavior of a given 
group of people, so  corporate culture is a term used to characterize how the managers 
and employees of particular companies tend to behave. But the term is also used by human 
resource managers and senior management in their attempts to proactively shape the kind 
of behavior (innovative, open, dynamic, etc.) they hope to nurture in their organizations. 
Promoting a distinctive corporate culture is also expected to enhance the sense of com-
munity and shared identity that underpins effective organizations.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Cross-cultural management issues arise in a range of business contexts.  Within individual 
ﬁ rms, for example, managers from a foreign parent company need to understand that local 
employees from the host country may require different organization structures and HRM 
procedures. In cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As), realizing the expected 
synergies very often depends on establishing structures and procedures that encompass 
both cultures in a balanced way. Cross-border joint ventures, alliances, or buyer–supplier 
relationships  between  two or more ﬁ rms also require a cultural compromise. Finally, for 
ﬁ rms to sell successfully to foreign customers requires culturally sensitive adaptations to 
products, services, marketing, and advertising. 
  Figure   5.1    outlines, at the most general level, links between business contexts and par-
ticular characteristics of individuals or groups that are influenced by social and cultural 
norms of a particular region. At the face-to-face level in meetings the language and behav-
ior of different peoples vary and their mutual understanding of each other’s culture will 
influence the effectiveness and efficiency of communication between them. This influences 
how well multicultural workplaces operate at all levels, from strategy setting at the senior 
level to plant-floor operations.  
 Firms also tend to have different organizational and decision-making practices depend-
ing on where they have evolved and which cultures and subcultures they encompass. For 
firms to build successful alliances and partnerships, or for M&A activities to succeed at 
the company-to-company level, there needs to be an understanding of the organizational

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
differences between them. This covers practically every element of corporate organizations 
from decision-making structures and systems and management–labor relationships to 
individual employees’ attitudes toward their work and their employer. 
 Finally, culture influences the behavior and preferences of clients and customers. To sell 
successfully in a foreign market, a manager needs to adapt his or her product or service to 
meet the different needs of that particular group of customers. Any alteration in advertis-
ing, marketing, product or service features, after-sales support, technical back-up, docu-
mentation, etc., will be partly guided by cultural differences. 
 Failure to do this ends in the kinds of marketing mistakes and communication blunders 
that become marketing folklore. For example, Ford’s low-cost truck was initially marketed 
as the Feira to Spanish-speaking people, but this means “ugly old woman” in Spanish. The 
Ford Comet, a high-end car, was sold as the Caliente in Mexico, which is local slang for 
“prostitute.” Unsurprisingly neither model did well in these markets. This reinforces the 
above point about the importance of language, but also demonstrates how some of the 
largest and most experienced companies do not appear to do the most basic cultural 
due diligence (their homework!) when launching products and services in foreign markets. 
The chapter on marketing strategy in this book examines these kinds of issues more closely. 
 Across all of the business contexts in  Figure   5.1    ignorance of cultural differences repre-
sents a common stumbling block for international managers.   Ethnocentrism , the belief 
that one’s own way of doing things is superior to that of others, can also be a major barrier 
to good international management. The challenge lies in recognizing differences, combin-
ing the advantages that stem from different styles and approaches, adjusting and adapting 
to succeed with different people, in different partnerships, and in different markets.

What kinds of cultural differences matter when organizations from different 
countries merge? 
 The definition of culture itself gives some indicators of the kinds of differences that matter. 
Organizations from different countries will have developed different beliefs, values, and 
patterns of behavior based on their underlying national culture. A wide range of differ-
ences could be important, including attitudes toward work and workplace practices, man-
agement–labor relations, the decision-making hierarchy, and division of responsibilities. 
Cross-border M&A often also requires changes to the marketing and branding of products 
and services as sales are expanded into new markets. Differences in the language, values, 
and preferences of customers in different countries also need to be taken into account.    
✔
  Culture has always been important 
 Despite the various patterns and processes of globalization, cultural differences still remain 
important. Even with greater common access, via various media and the Internet, to the 
same brands, rock icons, and sports stars, differences remain. Terms like   cultural con-
vergence   or, simply, Americanization (the homogenization of global consumer prefer-
ences through the ubiquity of McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, and Ford) overstate the similarities 
between groups of people around the world. (See the case  International Business Strategy 
in Action: McDonald’s .)

 McDonald’s 
 When José Bové, a self-proclaimed leader of France’s 
anti-globalization movement, was sentenced for vandal-
izing a McDonald’s restaurant in 1999, he claimed to have 
the backing of the French people. That might have been 
an overstatement, but 40,000 French people were there to 
show their support. It was not only the French, however; 
in the 1990s McDonald’s restaurants were vandalized in 
about 50 countries. At issue is the worldwide perception 
that McDonald’s represents a particular friendly Ronald-
McDonald type of US imperialism. Traditional lifestyles, 
critics say, are being eroded by McDonald’s marketing 
practices, its value chain system, its fast-food concept, and 
the unhealthy food itself. 
 Yet, McDonald’s bends over backwards to blend into 
local cultures. The company advertises itself to its crit-
ics as a global company owned and run by local people. 
Indeed, the franchise system makes it so that McDonald’s 
Japan is run by the Japanese and Israel’s McDonald’s res-
taurants are run by Israelis. Local business owners choose 
their menu’s offerings to fit their culture, find alternative 
suppliers, and create suitable marketing for their culture. 
An American in Saudi Arabia might seat single men with 
families at a McDonald’s opening, but a Saudi Arabian 
owner would know that this is unacceptable and the res-
taurant will be designed to accommodate the culture. 
 In the land of José Bové, Asterix, a French comic-strip 
character who stands for individuality and ironically sym-
bolizes local resistance to imperial forces, replaced the 
goofy Ronald McDonald in the company’s marketing in the 
early 2000s. In 1999, French McDonald’s went the extra 
mile to prove how local it was by printing advertisements 
making fun of US eating habits. In one ad, a large American 
cowboy complains that McDonald’s France does not import 
American beef to “guarantee maximum hygienic conditions.” 
French restaurants are more fashionably and more com-
fortably designed than North American ones to create an 
environment where customers may enjoy longer meals in 
accordance with French tradition. If they want, customers 
can order a beer from the menu. 
 In India, where local tastes are very different from those 
in the United States, the company crafted an entirely differ-
ent menu that does not use beef or pork due to the mostly 
vegetarian population. The Indian Big Mac is made of lamb. 
In Israel, the locally owned McDonald’s purchases over 
80 percent of its ingredients from local producers, includ-
ing 100 percent kosher hamburger meat, potatoes, lettuce, 
buns, and milkshake mix. There are no cheeseburgers 
in Israel’s McDonald’s because dairy products cannot be 
eaten together with meat. 
 On the other hand, McDonald’s does bring its own cul-
ture to its foreign operations. In China, where children’s 
birthdays are not traditionally celebrated, a successful 
McDonald’s marketing strategy encouraged birthday par-
ties at their establishments. Not a bad deal for children, 
but still a cultural effect from a foreign multinational. More 
mundane things, such as combo meals, are popularized 
through McDonald’s expansion. By promoting its carbon-
ated beverages in India, the firm is unsettling the country’s 
tea culture. The company’s presence creates a cultural 
exchange, not a one-sided cultural takeover. 
 Beyond reactionary behavior against McDonald’s cultural 
“impositions,” McDonald’s has had to suffer simply for 
being born in the United States. Just hours after the United 
States began bombing Afghanistan in 2001 McDonald’s res-
taurants were vandalized in cities in Pakistan and Indonesia 
and Muslim clerics asked for the boycott of US products. 
 For activists and cultural protectors, the most frus-
trating thing is that their calls go unheeded. Owners of 
McDonald’s franchises continuously remind customers 
that they too are locals, that their employees are locals, 
and that their suppliers are mainly local. In Brazil, some 
anti-war protestors on their way home will stop at a 
McDonald’s for a bite to eat. 
 Some of McDonald’s major troubles, however, are in its 
most established markets in the United States, Canada, 
and the UK. Russian and Chinese go-getters might think 
that a meal in McDonald’s puts them in a class above, but 
in its two major markets of North America and Europe, 
where the firm derives over two-thirds of all revenue, the 
food is considered unhealthy. Indeed, both Canada and 
the UK considered imposing a tax on fatty foods on the 
grounds that it was damaging to people’s health and it 
costs the health-care system a substantial amount. The 
tax is unlikely to be imposed because of a strong backlash 
from poverty groups who argue that this tax would place 
an uneven burden on those who depend on cheap food 
for their everyday survival. In the United States, the firm 
is being sued over claims that it misled parents about the 
nutritional value of its products, leading their children 
to become obese and unhealthy. McDonald’s in the UK 
reacted by eliminating supersized options from the menu. 
A set of healthier options has now been introduced in 
Europe and North America as the company fends off crit-
ics in some of its friendliest markets. The company has

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
 Cultures vary and these variations lead to real and significant differences in the ways that 
companies operate and people work. Moreover,  because  of globalization more and more firms 
are coming head to head with the added complexity of doing business globally, which stems 
from the huge amount of variety in the world that still exists (and arguably will always exist). 
 Before moving on to examine some typologies of global cultures, here is a word of warn-
ing. Much of this section will describe how various kinds of individual and group behavior 
can be linked to specific cultural groups and associate these cultural dispositions with dif-
ferent business styles and company structures. Acting on the basis of cultural stereotypes is 
highly sensitive and can be problematic. For example, at the simplest level a banker may be 
able to prove empirically that Pakistanis are more successful than Jamaicans at starting and 
running small businesses around the world. Using this insight as the basis for discriminat-
ing against Jamaicans wanting bank loans for business start-ups is not only unethical, but 
in most countries falls foul of race discrimination laws.   
also embraced sustainability and extended its corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) activities and reporting in order 
to keep one step ahead of a wider set of critics. In 2011, 
McDonald’s was among the Fortune’s top 10 world’s most 
admired companies.  
 What makes McDonald’s such an admired, recognizable 
brand, even amid an enduring fast-food backlash? New 
items on the menu have helped: salads (with Newman’s 
Own low fat dressing), wraps, oatmeal, and apple dippers. 
In addition, the chain constantly adds to its dollar menu, 
catering to those who have felt the recession’s crunch.  
 McDonald’s also operates a wide range of charity pro-
grams, including teacher awards and youth basketball 
games. And financially, the company is doing fine. In 
January 2011, the company announced that sales were up; 
since then the stock has continued to rise.

  Culture at two levels 
 There are traditionally two different approaches to looking at culture: 
 ■  The psychic or psychological level, which focuses on the internalized norms, attitudes, 
and behavior of individuals from a particular culture (  psychic distance is a measure of 
differences between groups).  
 ■   The institutional level, which looks at national (or group) culture  embodied  in institutions 
(government, education, and economic institutions as well as in business organizations).   
 In this chapter we will mainly discuss the first, culture as shared psychology, with a brief 
reference to national institutional differences at the end. 
 People who are born in, or grew up in, the same country tend to share similar cultural 
characteristics. Nordström and Valhne examined a sample of Swedish firms to understand 
the effects of psychic distance on market-entry strategies and costs.       6  They ranked 20 par-
ticular countries according to a range of national characteristics that contribute to psychic 
distance and found, as you might expect, that Denmark is closest to Sweden (1/20), the UK 
comes in at 6/20, Portugal at 15/20, Japan 16/20, Brazil 17/20 and Australia 20/20. 
 Nationality and culture tend to coincide, although nations encompass a wide variety 
of institutions, religions, beliefs, and patterns of behavior, and distinctive subcultures can

always be found within individual countries. The only way to make sense of this wide 
diversity is to characterize distinct cultural groups through simplified national stereotypes. 
 Many studies have attempted to create these stereotypes by mapping and comparing the 
shared characteristics of managers and employees in different countries. 7 Researchers then 
examine the effects of key differences on business behavior, organization, structure, and 
ultimately the performance of companies from different countries. The following describes 
the milestone studies of this kind in the management field.  
  Hofstede’s four dimensions of culture 
 Geert Hofstede is a Dutch psychologist who conducted one of the earliest and best-known 
cultural studies in management, on IBM’s operations in 70 countries around the world.       8 
Getting answers to 32 statements from over 116,000 questionnaires, he mapped key cultural 
characteristics of these countries according to four value dimensions:   
 1  Power distance   is the extent to which a culture accepts that power in organizations 
is distributed unequally. High power distance equates with steep organizational hier-
archies, with more autocratic leadership and less employee participation in decision 
making (see  Figure  5.2 for examples). 
 2  Uncertainty avoidance   is the degree to which members of a society feel uncomfortable 
with risk and uncertainty. High uncertainty avoidance (Japan, Argentina, France) will 
be reflected in the high priority placed on rituals, routines, and procedures in organiz-
ations and society in general. Countries with low uncertainty avoidance (Denmark, 
UK, India, United States) tend to emphasize flexibility and informality rather than 
bureaucracy. 
 3  Individualism   is the extent to which people are supposed to take care of themselves and 
be emotionally independent from others (see  Figure  5.2 for examples).

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
 4  Masculinity   is the value attributed to achievement, assertiveness, and material suc-
cess (Japan, Mexico, Germany, UK) as opposed to the stereotypical feminine values of 
relationships, modesty, caring, and the quality of life (Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark), 
according to Hofstede.     
  Figure   5.2    illustrates some of Hofstede’s findings using two of the most useful dimen-
sions, power distance against the degree of individualism/collectivism. It reflects some 
general stereotypes of the countries included, with clear grouping of Australia, the UK 
and the United States as highly individualistic and less hierarchical (small power distance) 
cultures against Mexico, Thailand, and Panama at the other extreme. We will elaborate on 
these definitions and their practical interpretation throughout this chapter. 
 Among his most important contributions, Hofstede provided strong evidence for the 
significance of national culture over professional role, gender, or race, as a determinant 
of variation in employees’ attitudes, values, and behaviors, accounting for 50 percent of 
the differences his study observed. However, his studies have come in for significant criti-
cism, despite widespread adoption of the four-dimensional framework. Three common 
criticisms are: (1) that the dimensions developed from data collected between 1968 and 
1973 were relevant only for that particular period; (2) that corporate cultural and other 
influences from this one-organization (IBM) study created significant bias; (3) that the 
sole use of attitude-survey questionnaires was not a valid basis for the resulting values and 
dimensions his study concluded with. 9 
 Although Hofstede has continued to write on culture, organizations, and management,       10  
it is useful to look more deeply into the work of another well-known Dutch culture guru.  
  Trompenaars’ seven dimensions of culture 
 Fons Trompenaars built on Hofstede’s work by expanding the framework for stereotyp-
ing and comparing different national cultures and by focusing more on the management 
implications of cultural differences. Using initial research involving 15,000 employees in 
50 countries, Trompenaars explored the “cultural extremes and the incomprehension that 
can arise when doing business across cultures,” even when people are working for the same 
company. 11 
 Trompenaars arrived at seven distinctive dimensions of culture and used the question-
naire responses in his study to map a wide variety of countries along a continuum from 
one extreme to the other within each dimension. The key to understanding this mapping 
approach is to identify where each country or culture is positioned  relative  to others on 
one or more of these dimensions. 
 Relative positioning gives insights into the kinds of conflicts, misunderstandings, and 
organizational and management problems that are likely to arise when individuals, groups, 
or firms from these countries interact in any of the ways described above. 
 1  Universalism  versus  particularism  . In universalistic cultures rules and regulations are 
applied in all situations, regardless of particular conditions or circumstances. The example 
used by Trompenaars refers to a salesman who does not fulfill his monthly sales quota 
because he was looking after his sick son. Should he be penalized according to standard 
company regulations or should he be excused because of the particular circumstances?    
 
 According to Trompenaars’ findings, Switzerland, Canada, and the United States are 
among the most universalist. Australia and the UK are also toward this end of the scale. 
Germany is closer to the center, as is France, but the latter sits on the particularist side 
of the scale. Korea, Russia, and China are the most particularist of countries. (Note that 
some of the countries studied by Hofstede, like the strongly particularist Yugoslavia, no 
longer exist.)

society are success, money, 
and material things

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 2  Individualism versus  collectivism  . This dimension, clearly building on Hofstede, centers 
on whether individual rights and values are dominant or subordinate to those of the 
collective society.  
 
 The most individualist countries are Canada, the United States, Switzerland, and the 
UK. Among the most collectivist are Japan, Egypt, and India (and Nepal and Kuwait).  
 3  Neutral  versus  emotional . This reflects how much emotions are displayed in the 
workplace. More importantly it indicates whether emotional or subjective (rather than 
objective) forms of assessment are thought to be the basis for good decision making 
in organizations. Some organizations emphasize reports, data, and analytical decision 
making by managers, whereas others feel that opinions, intuition, and gut feelings are 
credible or valid criteria. Predictably the most emotional countries include Italy and 
France and the least emotional groups (in the workplace at least) are the Japanese, 
Germans, Swiss, Chinese, and Indonesians. 
 4  Specific  versus  diffuse  . Do work relationships (such as the hierarchical relationship 
between a senior manager and a subordinate) exist just in the workplace (are they spe-
cific), or do they extend into the social context outside the workplace (diffuse)? Here 
a telling example is whether an employee is willing to help paint a senior manager’s 
house over a weekend. Clearly Australian bosses are likely to get a characteristically 
blunt answer to this request! China, Japan, India, and Singapore display highly diffuse 
relationships, Australia and the Netherlands the most specific.    
 5  Achievement  versus  ascription . This dimension refers to one’s status within organiz-
ations, contrasting those cultures where status, credibility, authority, and ultimately 
power tend to be based on merit (achieved) against those where class, gender, education, 
or age tend to be the defining characteristics (status is ascribed).   
 
Countries where status tends to be ascribed include Egypt, Turkey, and Argentina 
(and slightly less so, Russia, Japan, and France), and those where it is achieved include 
Norway, Sweden, and predictably the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK.  
 6  Attitudes toward time.  Sequential   (time as a sequence of events) versus   synchronic (sev-
eral events juggled at the same time) views of time tend to relate to punctuality for meet-
ings and deadlines. Swedes and other northern European cultures tend to be punctual 
and plan according to specific timetables. Many southern European, Latin American, and 
Arabic cultures see punctuality and chronological precision as far less important. They 
also tend to naturally cope with a range of issues simultaneously, rather than one by one. 
 7  Attitudes toward the environment.  This dimension reflects the emphasis a particular cul-
ture places on people’s relationship with nature and the natural environment. On the 
one hand some cultures emphasize control and subjugation of environmental forces, 
whereas others emphasize the need to work with nature, in harmony with the environ-
ment. Clearly religious and philosophical differences around the world influence differ-
ences within this dimension.   
 Trompenaars’ seven dimensions have been used in a variety of ways to gain insights into 
the kinds of problems that might arise in the contexts (face to face, company to company, 
and company to customer) outlined in  Figure   5.1   . In general they indicate the organiz-
ational characteristics we can expect from firms based in particular countries or dominated 
by certain nationalities. They are also used to measure changes in cultural values and 
behavior over time. Research shows that in both Japan and China, for example, achieve-
ment orientation is on the increase alongside some elements of individualism.       12 
 The Japanese are moving away from a reliance on collectivism in the form of the state, large 
firms, and group associations and placing more value on personal responsibility and individual 
performance. In China there is a shift in companies toward performance-related rewards and

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
individual initiative, built on the changing views of the growing urban elite. But there are also 
wider concerns regarding the social costs as well as the benefits of self-interest.  
  The GLOBE project’s nine dimensions of culture 
 More recent research has built on the Hofstede and Trompenaars research. The Global 
Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) project began in 1992 
and continues today. It has involved 150 researchers collecting data on cultural values and 
management and leadership attributes from 18,000 managers across 62 countries in the 
telecommunications, food, and banking industries. 13  In the same way as Hofstede and 
Trompenaars before them, the researchers place countries along a standard 1 to 7 scale. The 
GLOBE project, however, ends up with nine key cultural dimensions: 
 1  Assertiveness.  The United States, Austria, Germany, and Greece are high; Sweden, Japan, 
and New Zealand are low. 
 2  Future orientation.  A propensity for planning, investing, delayed gratification: Singapore, 
Switzerland, and the Netherlands are high; Russia, Argentina, and Italy are low.  
 3  Gender differentiation.  The degree to which gender role differences are maximized: 
South Korea, Egypt, India, and China are high; Hungary, Poland, and Denmark are low.  
 4  Uncertainty avoidance.  A reliance on societal norms and procedures to improve pre-
dictability, a preference for order, structure, and formality: Sweden, Switzerland, and 
Germany are high; Russia, Bolivia, and Greece are low.  
 5  Power distance.  Russia, Thailand, and Spain are high; Denmark, the Netherlands, and 
Israel are low.  
 6  Institutional collectivism (individualism vs. collectivism). Promoting active participation 
in social institutions: Sweden, South Korea, and Japan are high; Greece, Argentina, and 
Italy are low.  
 7  In-group/family collectivism.  A pride in small-group membership, family, close friends, 
etc.: Iran, India, and China are high; Denmark, Sweden, and New Zealand are low.  
 8  Performance orientation  (much like achievement orientation). Singapore, Hong Kong, 
and the United States are high; Russia, Argentina, and Italy are low.  
 9  Humane orientation  . An emphasis on fairness, altruism, and generosity: Ireland, 
Malaysia, and Egypt are high; Germany, Spain, France, Singapore, and Brazil are low.    
 As you can see, many of these dimensions match those of Hofstede and Trompenaars, 
and the overall GLOBE framework is very much an extension of their approach. 
 The GLOBE researchers have examined the HRM implications of these cultural differ-
ences for practicing managers and looked at ways to avoid the pitfalls of ignorance and 
insensitivity. 14 A similar long-running study by the CRANET network has focused on 
European cultural differences and reports similar findings. 15 
 As with the other cultural mapping studies by Hofstede and Trompenaars, GLOBE has 
faced some critical appraisal, which helps us understand the strengths and weaknesses of 
its concluding framework. A recent set of debates has usefully raised some methodological 
issues associated with these kinds of studies, and provides interesting points of contention 
we should be aware of, rather than blindly accepting the above kind of research.       16 
  Applying the national culture frameworks 
 Different styles of communication and interaction result from the cultural differences listed 
above. These can lead to workplace misunderstandings, poor interpersonal and intergroup 
relationships, inefﬁ ciency, and higher costs. Three examples provide some insights into 
how we can apply the above typologies. 
 Humane orientation 
 Cultures that emphasize 
helping others, charity, 
and people’s wider social 
obligations 

144
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 US managers, according to all of the above studies, are highly assertive and perform-
ance oriented relative to managers from other parts of the world (they come around the 
mid-point on all the other dimensions). Their interaction style is characteristically direct 
and explicit. They tend to use facts, figures, and logic to link specific steps to measurable 
outcomes, and this is the main focus of workplace interaction. Greeks and Russians are less 
individualistic, less performance oriented, and show lower levels of uncertainty avoidance 
(are less driven by procedures) than the Americans. When Russian and Greek managers, 
employees, customers, suppliers, or public-sector officials interact with US counterparts, 
they may well find their approach too direct and results focused. For them communication 
is likely to be more about mutual learning and an exploration of relevant issues than an 
explicit agreement about specific expectations and end results. Similarly, the Swedes may 
find the US style too aggressive and unfriendly, working against the relationship-building 
process that for them is a major objective of workplace interaction. 
 The Koreans and Japanese have highly gender-differentiated societies with males tend-
ing to dominate decision making and leading most face-to-face communication. The 
agenda for discussion is likely set by males, and traditional language forms differ according 
to whether a man is addressing a woman or an older person talking to a younger person, 
and vice versa. Gender- (and age-)related roles, responsibilities, and behaviors are there-
fore deeply embedded in language and customs. 17 Poland and Denmark lie at the other 
end of the continuum on the gender-differentiation dimension. Perhaps even more than 
other Western managers, their lack of awareness of this cultural difference runs the risk of 
both embarrassing female employees and offending and alienating senior Japanese male 
managers. This kind of clash can make negotiations and interaction of all kinds between 
these groups that much more difficult. 
 Certain kinds of HRM techniques are inappropriate for organizations that show high 
power distance ratings. Companies and management consultancies in the UK, the United 
States, and northern European countries have developed fairly participative management 
systems to improve productivity, based on their characteristically low power distance and 
flat organizational hierarchies. Techniques such as 360-degree feedback systems for devel-
oping management–employee relationships are not likely to work, however, in Mexican, 
Panamanian, Thai, or Russian organizations, which have high power distance and steep 
hierarchies. Subordinates are uncomfortable being asked to evaluate senior managers, and 
managers would not see subordinates as qualified to comment on their performance. More 
than this, to employees in some countries this kind of consultation can give the impression 
that senior managers do not know what they are doing! The employees may lose faith in 
senior management’s ability and leave! 
 None of the above examples means that international managers should (or ever could) 
entirely change their behavior to suit local values and practices. Like many of the challenges 
facing managers, cultural sensitivity and cross-cultural effectiveness come from striking 
a balance between one’s own norms, values, and principles and those of the “foreigner.” 
The lesson for multinational firms is that   ethnocentric   corporate cultures and completely 
standardized HR systems do not work. The key challenge is to adapt to get the best from 
local differences.    
 Ethnocentric 
  A belief in the superiority of 
one’s own ethnic group; the 
dominance of the home-
country culture in decision 
making, human resource 
management, and overall 
corporate culture in a 
multinational firm

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
  “The way we do things here”: the implications of cultural 
differences for organizations and managers 
 Mapping out a variety of national cultural typologies using the various dimensions of cul-
ture described above gives us some insights into the kinds of differences that exist among 
different groups of managers, employees, and organizations. 
 Two key questions about the role of the individual in a firm and the role of a firm in 
a society from Trompenaars’ study give us a starting point to explore the management 
implications of cultural differences. The responses in  Figure   5.3    reflect the degree of sup-
port for the particular proposition A or B for each of these questions. 
 Americans clearly display what has been termed (originally by the sociologist Max 
Weber) a mechanistic and functional view of the firm as an organization (A) and a 
shareholder-driven, profit-oriented view of this organization in society (although more 
than half the US vote in  Figure   5.3    was for option B). The Japanese tend to have a 
more organic view of the firm, emphasizing the importance of social networks and the 
obligation of the firm to a wider constituency of stakeholders (although this is a char-
acteristic of traditional Japan that has been strongly tested in the recent recessionary 
environment). 
 A wide range of factors within organizations are influenced directly or indirectly by the 
cultural predispositions of managers and employees. We know from the above studies and 
a wide range of other research that these factors include: 
 ■   The general relationship between employees and the organization: their roles and 
responsibilities, obligations, and loyalties and the link this has with life outside the 
workplace. 
 ■   Hierarchy, power and authority, and the accepted routes to attaining these, 
including factors that underpin status and credibility in different societies and 
organizations.  
 ■   The role of formal rules and regulations versus the informal communication, personal 
networks, and hidden “rules of the game.”  
 2 
How well do the characteristics described in the case match the respective, 
stereotypical national cultures of these countries? 
 According to the above frameworks they match reasonably well. The US culture is 
characterized as individualistic, achievement/performance oriented, and assertive. 
Most of these traits clash with the “feminine” (in Hofstede’s characterization) values 
of relationships, modesty, caring, and the quality of life emphasized by the Swedes. 
Hofstede finds US managers less hierarchical than most cultures, which is not indicated 
in the Pharmacia–Upjohn case. However, as  Figure   5.2    shows, both countries have a low 
power distance and high individualism rating, relative to other countries, but the United 
States has slightly higher power distance (steeper management hierarchy) than Sweden. 
Sweden also has a relatively high uncertainty avoidance ranking, preferring order, struc-
ture, and formality, which does not stand out in the case study. Swedes are also high on 
institutional collectivism but low on family or small-group collectivism. The Italians are 
the opposite. Unlike the Americans, the Italians are not at all oriented toward achieve-
ment (Trompenaars) or performance (GLOBE). They are also more emotional than the 
Swedes and Americans according to Hofstede and have a relatively low future orientation 
(GLOBE).   

146
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 ■   The accepted basis for decision making, including rationale, scientific, mechanistic, and 
objective versus subjective, tacit, rule of thumb, etc.  
 ■   The degree to which employees act and are treated as individuals or groups and the role 
of interpersonal relationships. 
 ■  Motivation and rewards systems. 
 ■  Interaction and communication mechanisms. 
 Work attitudes and the appropriate management of work attitudes have a significant 
influence on productivity and innovativeness in a company. Managers and employees who 
are motivated by their core social values to work hard and continually strive to improve 
their company’s products and services and the processes by which they are produced are 
clearly a source of competitive advantage. It is interesting to note how social norms may 
drive a strong work ethic despite individual dissatisfaction with workload or job responsi-
bilities. This has been shown in several companies between US and Japanese factory 
workers where the Japanese are found to be more loyal and aligned with company objec-
tives but far less satisfied individually. 18 
  Table   5.2    compares interview responses from sample workforces in seven countries. 
The resulting ranking of what it is that employees value most from their jobs shows that 
“interesting work” is what tends to engage most people, beyond everything else.

 CROSS-CULTURAL MANAGEMENT 
 Three key areas capture many of the factors covered by the above typologies and cultural 
stereotypes, where cultural differences can make a signiﬁ cant difference at the company-to-
company and face-to-face levels. These are organization, leadership, and communication 
(see  Figure  5.4 ). 
 Organization 
 Organization styles range from organic, informal, or people oriented to systematic or mech-
anistic, formal, or task oriented, in keeping with some common organizational dimensions 
described by sociologists throughout history (such as Max Weber and Emile Durkheim). 
Organizations that operate very much around personal relationships and social networks 
contrast those that are much more functional and logical. In fact different cultures and dif-
ferent ﬁ rms display elements of both these characteristics, but the balance varies consid-
erably and can create tensions when groups of people or ﬁ rms from different ends of the 
spectrum interact or try to cooperate. 
 As an aid to predicting differences among individuals, groups, or firms, and understand-
ing the significance of these variations,  relative  differences among countries, organizations, 
and groups of people are important, rather than any absolute scores. For example, family 
companies are characteristically directive, individual oriented but organic. Multinational 
firms are usually more autocratic and mechanistic. Consulting and professional services 

148
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
firms are often mechanistic and emphasize individual performance and rewards but may 
also be fairly team oriented. Entrepreneurial new ventures will usually be organic, unsys-
tematic, and group oriented. 
 Leadership 
 Leadership styles range from individual oriented, directive, autocratic, top down, or authori-
tarian to group oriented, participative, democratic, bottom up, or egalitarian. Again, cultural 
groups and corporations often encompass both kinds of leadership but tend to reﬂ ect one 
dominant style. 
 Individual managers from cultures that score high on the power distance or assertive-
ness dimensions are likely to be viewed by those from other cultures as autocratic and 
directive but will tend to view others as indecisive and too compromising. They will 
not want to spend too much time discussing issues to achieve a consensus. If they also 
reflect an organic or informal (low uncertainty avoidance) culture, this will result in an 
instinctive or unsystematic decision-making and implementation style, and they might 
be viewed as an unpredictable autocrat. This contrasts the combination of high power 
distance and high uncertainty avoidance, which results in a more directive and mechan-
istic style. Such leaders prefer established formal routines and a command-and-control 
bureaucracy, while other managers are likely to see this as over-regulated and inflexible. 
The Pharmacia and Upjohn case demonstrates a range of these styles and the problems 
that result from the imposition of a new style of organization and leadership within a 
corporate merger.  
 Communication 
 Clearly, at the face-to-face level language differences can be the most prominent barrier to 
communication and therefore to cooperation and coordination. English speakers tend to 
have an advantage in many situations since English has emerged as the main language of 
business globally. However, this has led to complacency among some indigenous English 
speakers, notably the British and the North Americans. First, less effort is often made to 
learn other languages and their associated cultures, which normally limits a manager’s 
understanding of foreign colleagues, workers, or customers. Second, the assumption is 
often made that once the language barrier is broken cultural differences are also removed, 
whereas these may remain, causing miscommunication and misinterpretation. As for much 
of this chapter on culture, preparation and awareness are the best starting points for mini-
mizing differences that can create problems. 
 Figure 5.4  Management dimensions of culture 

149
CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
 It is through efficient communication that two parties steer toward an understanding—
a mutually agreed basis for doing business. The signs and signals on this route to an 
understanding are strongly influenced by culture. Different groups have different ways of 
displaying approval or of showing frustration in negotiations and different ideas of what 
constitutes a final agreement. The Japanese do not really have an equivalent word for the 
English “no” and indicate disapproval in a range of non-verbal ways. The Japanese word 
 hai  does mean “yes” but it often means “yes, I understand what you are saying” not “yes, 
I agree with what you are saying.” Germans place a lot of emphasis on written communi-
cations and documented evidence rather than verbal interaction, compared to the Spanish 
and Italians to whom verbal interaction and agreement is recognized as binding in some 
contexts. The Americans prefer legal contracts and have armies of lawyers to make 
agreements highly specified. Other, more organic business cultures tend to work toward 
a relationship in which trust and understanding replace the need for legally binding 
contracts. Again, awareness through preparation and anticipation of differences is the 
best starting point for avoiding  culture clash .  
 The corporate response 
 How have MNEs responded to the challenge of managing across cultural boundaries? 
What kinds of organization structures, HRM procedures, and corporate cultures have been 
developed to cope with the enormous differences among people and to unify this diversity 
toward a common purpose? 
 At a very general level good transnational firms develop an  awareness  and appreciation of 
cultural differences among their managers and employees. They also take steps to encourage 
 adaptation  of personal behavior or organizational practices, or products and services, to suit 
the changing mix of cultures within the firm, in subsidiaries and in key markets. Training 
programs, including a range of activities at the induction stage, when new recruits join a firm 
or existing personnel take up a role in a new country, are a standard way for firms to do these 
things. Job rotation, with a focus on developing international managers with personal experi-
ence in a variety of different countries, is also practiced by a number of firms. It is normally 
very difficult to assess such practices using any form of cost–benefit analysis. The costs are 
usually easily identifiable, but the benefits are very often intangible. For many experienced 
international companies, such as Shell or Nestlé, a long-term commitment to (and invest-
ment in) cultural awareness is simply accepted as a necessary part of being global. 
 Beyond awareness and adaptation, the best firms aim to  leverage the diversity of cultures 
within their organizations and combine the best aspects of different ways of doing things. 
Corporate culture, a shared identity spanning culturally diverse groups of employees, 
provides a way to do this. Companies can usefully invest in their own socialization mech-
anisms, such as social events alongside regular meetings and conferences. Company maga-
zines, intranets, and even in-house television channels for corporate communications can 
all support this process. These may not only improve cross-cultural awareness, but also 
promote shared values, symbols, and even language to help bind employees together.       19 
 Here is a list of other useful strategies for managing cultural diversity distilled from a 
number of research studies: 20 
 1   Recognize diversity. Identify and map the various national cultures and ethnic groups 
within the firm and use this to understand which elements of consistency and stand-
ardization can or should be promoted.  
 2   Build diversity issues into recruitment, HRM planning, strategy, location decisions, alli-
ances, and partnerships. This helps avoid clashes and inefficiency and supports cultural 
awareness. 
 Culture clash 
  When two cultural groups 
(national or corporate) 
meet, interact, or work 
together and differences 
in their values, beliefs, 
rules of behavior, or 
styles of communication 
create misunderstandings, 
antagonism, or other 
problems 

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
150
 3   Identify where and to what degree local divisions should be encouraged or empowered 
to take the lead in expressing and managing diversity. Some degree of devolution of 
responsibility away from the center of the firm allows local divisions to identify aspects 
of diversity that are most important to them and their operations.  
 4   Encourage cross-border discussion and interaction as well as focused training. Include 
specific kinds/combinations of international experience for fast-track managers.  
 5   Aim for a cultural balance in particular areas of strategic and tactical decision making 
(such as brand changes for foreign markets). Ensure a (numerically) balanced pool of 
managers or appropriately diverse inputs into decision making.  
 6   Lead from the top. Aim to match the geographic diversity of the firm’s businesses with 
a culturally mixed senior management group and board of directors (as in the case of 
Sony and Unilever).

 What could senior managers have done before and after the merger to 
alleviate some of the problems that resulted from culture clash? 
 A simple starting point would be to review the various frameworks (Hofstede, Trompenaars, 
and GLOBE, for example) to understand some generic differences between the national 
cultures involved in the merger and anticipate some of the likely problems. It would have 
also helped to examine the potential areas of organizational conflict with senior managers 
from each company and/or with managers with some experience of two or more of the 
countries and their ways of doing things. Some degree of cultural training or induction 
plus an investment in joint meetings and events to get to know each other could also have 
improved understanding and morale. However, the cost–benefit trade-off for these kinds 
of pre- and post-merger activity is difficult to precisely assess.   
  Multinational organization structures: imperialist or independent? 
 A key dilemma for international ﬁ rms is the degree to which they promote or even 
impose a common, standardized corporate culture across the organization. Although this 
will create economies of scale and be more efﬁ cient in a number of respects, it will also 
stiﬂ e diversity and create clashes with local cultures and ways of doing things around the 
organization. 
 Firms respond to this dilemma in different ways, with different outcomes. At the 
simplest level we can map out a range of responses from what is termed  imperialist , 
where a common culture is imposed wherever a company has a presence, to  federal-
ist or  independent structures, where each national subsidiary bases its own culture on 
local norms and values. There are problems associated with either of these extremes 
and most firms try to steer a middle line, standardizing some elements across the 
whole organization to centralize and simplify some practices and unify employees, 
while allowing differentiation where necessary. This  transnational culture allows for a 
compromise in work styles, values, and approaches, harnessing the strengths that lie 
in diversity.

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
 Table  5.3 illustrates a range of organization types. In particular, it links elements of 
organization structure and design with cultural orientation, for example, in the relation-
ship between headquarters and regional subsidiaries. It specifically extends the ethnocen-
tric,   polycentric , and  geocentric typologies introduced by Perlmutter in the 1960s. 21 
 ■  Ethnocentric  firms are where top management is dominated by home-country nation-
als, and procedures and management styles are transferred from the head office and 
imposed on regional subsidiaries in place of local ways of doing things.  
 ■  Polycentric  firms tend to act like a federation of semi-autonomous organizations with 
financial controls or strict reporting structures holding them together. Subsidiaries are 
able to reflect the local cultural norms, and headquarters appreciates the need for dif-
ferent organization designs, procedural norms, rewards systems, etc., as long as profits 
flow to the center.  
 ■  Geocentric firms are seen as the ideal, collaborative, and meritocratic form of global 
organization. (Unilever is seen as an example based on the above statement.) An equal 
sharing of power and responsibility between headquarters and subsidiary; senior man-
agement promoted according to ability rather than nationality; subsidiaries that share 
worldwide objectives with managers focusing beyond national market interests.   
 In the geocentric organization the  benefits of cultural diversity, such as knowledge 
of local customers and business practices, are harnessed for the good of the firm as a 
whole. The  costs  of diversity, such as language and communication problems, differ-
ent values, and attitudes toward work, are minimized. Firms moving toward this more 
balanced, geocentric approach have to recognize diversity and its effects and identify 
which elements of consistency in regulations and values should be promoted, where and 
when. Local divisions must identify aspects of diversity that are most important to them 
and their operations and take the lead in expressing and managing these differences. 
Discussion, interaction, cross-divisional teamwork and job rotation, support, aware-
ness, and understanding go alongside training programs, language courses, and cultural 
assimilation.  
 Unilever is an example of a firm that has closely examined the range of cultures it 
encompassed and made a deliberate attempt to use cultural differences as a strength rather 
than a weakness for fulfilling its strategic aims. As part of a high-profile internal campaign 
the company described itself as a  multi-local multinational , and this was used to explicitly 
inform employees of its cultural tolerance. According to a statement from a Unilever board 
chairman, one of the firm’s objectives was to “Unileverize our Indians and Indianize our 
Unileverians.” 22

acquisition (M&A). They can either impose their own style of management on these organ-
izations or allow them the independence to reﬂ ect their own cultural norms and existing 
corporate cultures. 23 
 Cultural differences often prove to be a significant post-merger barrier for managers 
looking to realize the synergies and added value of pooling the resources and capabilities 
of two companies from different parts of the world. The Pharmacia–Upjohn case above 
illustrates this clearly. Culture clash and its impact on the bottom line are often complex 
and difficult to predict. More often failure to anticipate culture clash results from the lack 
of awareness on the part of senior managers and deal makers driving the M&A strategy. 
Financial analyses that focus the due-diligence process of counting up assets and identify-
ing cost-cutting benefits tend to miss any estimation of cultural and organizational synergy 
(or lack thereof). Anticipating such problems and preparing for the development of effec-
tive relationships between people from both sides of an M&A or an alliance is central to 
maximizing the rewards. 
 Daimler-Benz ran into these problems when it merged with Chrysler. A number of 
senior-level US managers either were asked to leave or left because they were unhappy 
about the style of management imposed by Daimler. Among these early leavers were 
members of the design team responsible for the PT Cruiser and other Chrysler suc-
cesses of the late 1990s. Many went to arch-rival General Motors, which is not an 
unusual outcome. One study showed that on average 20 percent of a firm’s top man-
agement will leave within one year of being acquired and 70 percent will go within 
five years. 24  
 Cultural awareness and some degree of organizational adaptation can limit the 
number of key people who do leave following a cross-border M&A. Understanding 
how to predict and mitigate the negative effects of cultural differences should be on 
the agenda for all managers. Despite this, in some cases an ethnocentric, imperialist 
approach is precisely what is needed to drive a newly merged organization forward. 
When Carlos Ghosn led the partial takeover of Nissan by Renault, he imposed a very 
non-Japanese way of doing things on the firm. In terms of the firm within its broader 
economic and social context, breaking  keiretsu ties and laying off employees were radi-
cal steps to take. Internally he instituted performance-related pay and promotion and 
cut through a range of traditional rituals around HRM, budget control, and decision 
making that were underpinned by the traditional Japanese culture of the company. 
These were the kinds of changes that needed to be made to reverse years of losses and 
indebtedness. It was also, arguably, impossible for the incumbent Japanese manage-
ment to make such changes. ( Chapter 18 , on Japan, contains the full Nissan–Renault 
case.) 
 At the other end of the spectrum, reflecting again on  Table  5.3 , Tata Tea Limited, 
owner of 54 tea estates and the second-most popular tea brand in India, provides us with 
an example of a successful M&A which followed the “independent” approach vis-à-vis 
its newly acquired subsidiary. In March 2000 it bought one of the UK’s top tea brands, 
Tetley Tea, some say on the basis of profits at Tata Consulting Services, the successful IT 
and software arm of the $9 billion Tata conglomerate. Coming more than 50 years after the 
end of 200 years of British colonial rule that had supported British ownership of tea estates 
in India, this shift of power is an appropriate symbol for the twenty-first century. But 
the takeover was barely noticed by the British public. In stark contrast to the imperialist 
approach of the British in India all those years ago, Tata took a hands-off approach, allow-
ing the existing management, with its local knowledge and experience, to continue running 
Tetley. A federal structure with devolved decision making is supported by a polycentric 
organizational style. 25

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Danone and Parmalat—going international, staying local 
 The dairy industry, in the main, is a local industry. Most 
dairy products sold at local supermarkets come from 
processing plants within a 500 mile (800 km) radius. 
However, this does not mean that these firms are all small, 
local operations. On the contrary, there are a small number 
of very large MNEs in this industry that do business world-
wide and target their dairy offerings to local demand. The 
best known of these is Nestlé, which began operations 
in 1904 when it opened evaporated milk factories in both 
Europe and the United States. Today the company is the 
largest dairy company in the world and has operations in 
86 countries. There are a couple of other large competitors 
as well, although they do not compete on as broad a scale. 
 One of these is Danone, a French MNE with annual 
revenues of over €17 billion for 2010, which make it one 
of the world’s 500 largest firms. The company’s product 
line is not as broad as Nestlé, but it is just as big as the 
Swiss MNE in the dairy sector. Danone has operations in 
120 countries and employs over 100,000 people. However, 
its primary base is Europe where it generates 56 percent 
from Europe, 14 percent from Asia and 30 percent from 
rest of the world. 
 Danone was originally a Spanish yogurt producer that 
merged with the French firm Gervais in 1967. Then in 1973 
the company merged with BSN, a glass manufacturer, and 
adopted the packaging capability of the glass system to the 
food business. However, the glass business was dropped 
in the late 1970s, and since then Danone has focused on 
defining its place in the dairy industry and determining 
how it can better address the cultural demands of its 
local customers. With the decision to focus most heav-
ily on Europe and to take advantage of the expanding 
EU, Danone set up centralized purchasing and research 
departments in order to obtain economies of scale in 
food distribution across that continent. At the same time 
the company looked to gain a greater presence in other 
markets, including North America, subsequently taking 
a 40 percent stake in Stonyfield Farm, an organic yogurt 
maker based in Londonderry, New Hampshire. Although 
Stonyfield continued to operate autonomously, the firm’s 
strong customer relations program and its expertise in 
marketing fast-growing organic products provided Danone 
the opportunity to further increase its US market share to 
exploit the strengths of its new acquisition. 
 And to ensure that it continues to focus on its main busi-
ness of dairy food, Danone has sold off its grocery business 
and withdrawn from brewing and packaging. Today the 
company’s efforts are being directed most heavily toward 
the distribution of French-made dairy products. So in both 
Europe and its worldwide markets, Danone is working 
to answer the question: how can we develop and market 
French-made dairy products that meet the needs of the 
local market?  
 The other major global rival to Nestlé was the Italian 
MNE, Parmalat SpA. Like Danone, Parmalat marketed a 
wide variety of dairy products including milk, yogurt, des-
serts, butter, and cheese. Yet the company was best known 
for its development of ultra-high-temperature (UHT) pas-
teurized milk that allows milk to last up to six months 
without refrigeration. By specializing in the production 
and distribution of UHT milk across Europe, Parmalat 
was able to cut both production and distribution costs and 
to increase its profitability. At the same time, and unlike 
Danone, the company was more vigorous in its inter-
national expansion. In addition to moving into France and 
Germany in the 1970s, the company began expanding into 
North and South America soon thereafter. For the financial 
year ended December 31, 2010, Parmalat revenue was 
EUR4.3 billion. As a result, Parmalat earned 26 percent of 
its revenues in Europe, 47 percent in North, Central and 
South America, 17 percent from Australia and and 9 per-
cent from Africa.  
 Like its two other competitors, Nestlé and Danone, 
Parmalat carefully targeted its products to the local 
market and sought to acquire local companies that had 
established markets. For example, Parmalat purchased 
Ault Dairies, one of Canada’s largest operations, as well 
as Beatrice Foods, another major Canadian firm. Parmalat 
subsequently became that country’s largest dairy firm. 
Parmalat also had its subsidiaries employ the company’s 
food expertise to exploit their local markets. For example, 
drawing on its UHT technology, Parmalat’s Australian

subsidiary was able to export milk products throughout 
the Asian market, and the company’s Argentinean subsidi-
ary, which specialized in UHT milk products, was able to 
create export markets in Brazil and Venezuela. In addition, 
in catering to local tastes the company developed a wide 
variety of products such as a dessert called  dulce de leche , 
which it exported to a large number of countries including 
the United States, the UK, Russia, Spain, Uruguay, and 
Venezuela. 
 Parmalat, however, tended to maintain locally known 
brands, rather than replacing them with its own. In the UK, 
for example, Parmalat owned the Loseley yogurt brand, 
which was well regarded as quite an upmarket brand. 
Similarly, consumers in Canada and Australia may be sur-
prised to hear that their favorite brands, such as Beatrice 
or Pauls, were owned by Parmalat. 
 Danone and Parmalat are good examples of com-
panies that sell products that are culturally influenced. In 
Danone’s case, it has chosen to do so by staying primarily 
in Europe. Parmalat, on the other hand, has been much 
more active in the larger international arena. Both, how-
ever, have been successful because they have been able 
to blend their expertise with the needs of their specific 
markets. 
 In the case of Parmalat this success now appears to have 
come to an end. It reached sales of $9.4 billion in 2002 and 
managed acquired brands in 30 different countries. But in 
December 2003, with talk of fraud scandals in Italy, it was 
revealed that Parmalat had a reported $11 billion debt and 
$5 billion in cash missing. It has continued operating but 
it became a target for acquisition.  but is much reduced in 
scale and global scope. It has sold off numerous national 
businesses and still faces ongoing litigation.  In June 2011, 
the EC approved the take over of Parmalat by French rival 
Lactalis.

 Explain why one organization might want to impose some of its ways of doing 
things on another, such as an acquired firm or subsidiary. 
 Standardizing ways of doing things across the overall organization, to a certain extent, 
can be more efficient. Differences can create difficulties in communication, teamwork, 
motivation, or coordination, and the impact on company performance can be significant. 
It is important to make the distinction between the values, beliefs, and norms, plus the 
associated work practices and management structures that stem from the dominant 
national culture (the imposition can then be described as ethnocentric) or from the 
corporate culture. In the latter case the firm will be aiming to derive the benefits of 
having a shared culture that bridges the national cultural differences across the overall 
organization.   
 Cultural differences between groups of people in the one firm, or between the 
employees of two firms engaged in a joint venture, are not necessarily a problem. However, 
when they do create difficulties in terms of communication, teamwork, motivation, or 
coordination, the impact on company performance can be significant, despite the fact that 
clear cause-and-effect relationships are often difficult to identify precisely. Rather than a 
single “best practice” for dealing with this, the examples above suggest that solutions are 
context specific. 

155
CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
  CULTURE EMBODIED IN NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 
 The second level at which we can analyze cultural differences and their effects is at the 
institutional level, where national cultural characteristics are  embodied  in institutions from 
government agencies and governance mechanisms to the education system, economic insti-
tutions, and business organizations. 
 Firms engaging in cross-border joint ventures or M&A need to take account of the 
national context in which the new partner or acquired firm is situated. Similarly, when 
marketing and selling products in a new national market, these broader differences matter. 
A country’s distinctive political, legal, and institutional context partly reflects its dominant 
national culture. Education systems, labor laws, environmental regulations, capital markets, 
and the relationships between private-sector businesses and public-sector organizations 
will vary accordingly. 26 
 Trompenaars uses his findings simply to divide various countries into subgroups 
reflecting shared characteristics stemming from common cultural influences ( Figure  5.5 ). 
 ■  Western pluralism  emphasizes individual competitiveness, commonly represented by 
separate ventures competing in price-defined markets for success. Survival of the fittest 
is the catchphrase, and companies tend to be run as meritocracies.  
 ■  Command economies  are centrally planned hierarchies with less individualism and less 
individual incentive. Clearly, as global politics changes, countries are tending to move 
out of this category. For example, Poland is now an emerging capitalist country reflect-
ing the characteristics of Western pluralism more than a command economy.  
 ■  Organic ordering  refers to the family-centered hierarchies of Asia, southern Europe, and 
Latin America. Inter- and intra-organization interaction will be based around infor-
mation sharing and collaborative competition.  
 ■  Structured networks  reflect the more equal, structured relationships between companies 
and with public-sector organizations that exist in some countries.    
 France, with some comparisons with other Western economies and organizations, pro-
vides an example, giving a snapshot of some of the main characteristics that stem from the 
country’s cultural distinctiveness.

  France: cultural and social characteristics that create 
a national distinctiveness 
 National characteristics 
 ■   Central planning, national protectionism for domestic industry, and strong government 
intervention in the market (compared to other European economies) lie at the heart of 
the French system. Civil servants are intellectual and respected as in Japan (but not the 
UK) and well paid (unlike Japan).  
 ■   Communication tends to be vertical (up–across–down). Bypassing official channels is 
not common: uncertainty reduction tends to predominate. 
 ■   Hierarchy is important, bureaucracy respected. Clear hierarchy, divisionalization, and 
rules and regulations guide behavior. However, this exists alongside a respect for maver-
ick gestures and individuals or groups that overcome the obstacles and beat the system.  
 ■   Government-to-business links are formal and informal, with the elitist groups from the 
 grande écoles  bridging public and private sectors at the senior level. Ascription dominates 
over achievement compared to the UK or the United States, again with parallels with Japan.  
 ■   Competition occurs at school age when success determines assignment to a particular 
 cadre or  echelon inside and outside the workplace (depending on the school attended as 
much as individual performance). 
 ■   France has a large number of family-owned and managed firms. It does not have the 
 Mittelstand   (small technical and engineering firms) that underpin the chemical and 
machine tool industries in Germany. 
 ■   Capital markets are competitive but are not as “short-termist” as in the UK and the 
United States, with an overwhelming emphasis on share values and dividends. France 
does not have the strong interfirm networks that exist in Germany and Japan ( keiretsu ), 
which include links between financial institutions (banks, institutional shareholders) 
and the companies they fund. 
 French organizations 
 ■   French companies also tend to be hierarchical, bureaucratic, and well structured, but 
there is a strong view of the company as a social entity (an   esprit de corps ) with an 
emphasis on obligation and loyalty rather than individual gain.   
 ■   Despite moves toward a more equal relationship, French managers continue to have a 
supervisory role over workers. German and Japanese managers, by comparison, tend to 
be more collegiate and cooperative across levels of the hierarchy, including mentoring 
arrangements between senior and junior managers.  
 ■   Hierarchical relationships are diffuse (in Trompenaars’ terminology) rather than 
limited to the workplace (France ranks highest among European countries along this 
dimension). Companies have a responsibility toward the wider society, and managers, 
because of their professional status, have a role to play in society.  
 ■   Scientific management techniques, termed   gestion  , dominate, which parallels German 
zeal for quantification and measurement to guide performance improvement.   
 ■   There is a premium on technical and on-the-job training (similar to Germany and Japan). 
Marketing and accountancy skills are less valued than in the UK and the United States.  
 ■   A surprise to many observers is that one-fifth of the labor force is unionized. French 
labor law ( Code du Travail ) is comprehensive and enforced. Companies are relatively 
loyal to their employees compared to British or US firms, but there is not the strong 
social contract that exists in Japan.

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
 1   Culture can be defined as “the sum total of the beliefs, rules, techniques, institutions, 
and artifacts that characterize human populations.”  
 2   Cultural differences can have an important effect at the face-to-face or company-to-
company levels and need to be taken into account in dealing with different groups of 
customers around the world.  
 3   Culture can be analyzed at two levels: the psychic distance between groups of people, 
and the differences in culture embodied in national institutions and socio-economic 
systems.  
 4   Hofstede, Trompenaars, and the GLOBE researchers have constructed useful frame-
works for understanding broad differences between national cultures which underpin 
differences in the design of organizations and the behavior of managers and employees.  
 5   Differences in organization, leadership, and communication can be used to measure 
differences in groups and individuals and help managers anticipate when and why cul-
tures may clash.  
 6   Company responses to the challenges of managing diversity range from the imperialist 
to the independent approaches.  
 7   Ethnocentric firms impose a common culture on all subsidiaries, polycentric firms 
allow subsidiaries to reflect local ways of doing things, and geocentric firms maintain a 
balance between center and subsidiary.

 Do not throw your  meishi ! 
 Some time ago the Competitiveness Division of the 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in the British 
government commissioned research on British small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that had managed to set 
up successful businesses in Japan, one of the toughest 
(though lucrative) global markets to break into for foreign 
firms (see  Chapter 18 ). Numerous success stories from the 
study show how some firms managed to adapt to the differ-
ences in culture, society, and business practices that can 
act as barriers to foreign firms. But there are also numer-
ous tales of the blunders that some managers made that 
undermined their efforts to establish themselves in Japan. 
 Meishi  is Japanese for “business card,” but has a deeper 
significance in Japan than elsewhere as a represen-
tation of the employee’s allegiance to and respect for 
his or her company. The strong emphasis placed on loy-
alty and obligation between employees and their firms, 
lifetime employment based on a moral contract (rather 
than a price-based contract), and a manager’s position 
as a member of a collective all have a strong influence 
on his (sometimes her) behavior when interacting with 
others.  Kaisha-in  literally means “company person,” but 
it also denotes the individual as a representative of “our 
company” in the sense of a shared group consciousness. 
The company name comes first, before the individual’s 
name on the  meishi  and when making introductions. The 
exchange of  meishi  also establishes relative rank within the 
strict corporate and social hierarchy and therefore guides 
the correct behavior and even form of language used for 
interacting. Overall for the Japanese exchanging  meishi is 
an important symbolic ritual. 
 A senior technology manager from Scotland on his first 
assignment to Japan was attempting to establish a stra-
tegic alliance with a local firm as a starting point for mar-
keting and selling his firm’s products locally. In his first 
meeting he faced six senior executives from the Japanese 
firm, ranged across a board room table traditionally in 
order of seniority. Almost the first act of the Scottish man-
ager was to  throw  his newly printed  meishi  across the table 
to each of the Japanese executives in turn! 
 There is no way of knowing how significant this single 
act was in undermining this firm’s market entry in Japan. 
It failed in its attempt to forge an alliance with this particu-
lar Japanese firm and with others, eventually leading it to 
abandon its attempts. What we can say for certain is that 
a small amount of preparation by this manager to build

CHAPTER 5 INTERNATIONAL CULTURE
even a basic understanding of business etiquette in Japan 
would have improved this company’s chances of building a 
successful business in Japan. 
 The overall study, including 30 detailed case studies 
of successful British firms in Japan, demonstrates very 
clearly that managers need to understand the cultural 
and social norms that underpin business practices in dif-
ferent countries if they are going to do business in those 
countries. The lesson applies to firms engaged in cross-
border mergers and alliances, expanding into new markets 
through foreign direct investment activities, or even at 
the simple level, when hiring new recruits from overseas, 
outsourcing to foreign countries, or selling products and 
services abroad. Cultural awareness is critical to making 
business relationships work, at the face-to-face level or at 
the company-to-company level.

 REAL CASE 
 Sport can be local  and global: Manchester United 
 For most sports there appears to be a natural con-
nection with the cultures and communities of particular 
locations and even individual venues. Often history plays a 
strong role, even when sports are played internationally. 
St Andrews Links Course, Lord’s Cricket Ground, and 
Wembley Stadium all have a particular symbolism to 
players and fans of golf, cricket, and football (soccer) in 
and beyond the UK. 
 These contrast with more “placeless” global sporting 
events, particularly the Olympic Games, which involve most 
nations of the World. Rather than creating a sense of com-
mon identity such events can reinforce national cultural 
identities through international competition. 
 Other sports remain local: Japanese Sumo Wrestling, 
Aussie Rules Football, and Hurling in Ireland, for example, 
where the connection with national culture, community 
and history are strongest. American football is played in 
several countries but only seriously in the United States. It 
is not only a huge commercial enterprise but, like basket-
ball and baseball, strongly embedded in local communities 
through schools and colleges, as an important symbol of 
US cultural identity.  
 Some sports could be defined as regional, such as 
baseball which is predominantly based in North America, 
but also popular in Japan and played little elsewhere. A 
few sports are marked on a global basis, although not all 
parts of the triad are fully involved. Golf, tennis, and soccer 
have global television audiences and advertising revenues. 
Among these, soccer is recognized as the biggest, played 
by an estimated 240 million people with 1.5 million teams 
and 300,000 clubs worldwide. Many countries, from Brazil 
to Cameroon, Italy to South Korea, would claim the game 
as an important part of popular national culture. But soc-
cer is not a major sport in North America, where it ranks 
well behind American football, baseball, hockey, and car 
racing. 
 Europe hosts some of the major soccer club brands, 
with 52 leagues and a combined income of over $13 billion.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
Within this the English Premiership league is worth 
$3 billion. Perhaps the leading club in the Premiership 
is Manchester United. Not your average soccer club, but 
certainly one of the best illustrations in the sporting world 
of the evolving mix between local cultural heritage and 
international business. 
 Born in 1878, Manchester United long epitomized the 
connection between the local team and the local com-
munity. Its fan base was dominated for over a hundred years 
by local people, with Trafford Park and the Manchester 
Ship Canal, one of the world’s first industrial centers, 
at its heart. The grassroots, blue-collar, working-man’s 
passion and fierce loyalty remain at the cultural heart of 
the club today. Rather than symbolizing English culture it 
demonstrates the strength and persistence of the regional 
subculture of England’s industrial north-west. This is rein-
forced by strong rivalry with other leading clubs such as 
Liverpool, Arsenal, and Chelsea. Now the brands of these 
teams are very multinational. 
 In the early 1990s, despite strong growth in inter-
national merchandising sales through Manchester United 
Merchandising, over 90 percent of revenues to the club 
still came from the domestic UK market. But a growing 
global fan club, the international spread of  Manchester 
United Magazine , and the growing availability of televised 
games beyond the UK (particularly via Rupert Murdoch’s 
global media networks) led to an export drive in the late 
1990s and early 2000s. Countries with national teams 
but few big league teams, like Ireland, Scandinavia, and 
a range of Asian countries, where soccer is watched by 
millions on TV, became the club’s best markets. By 2002 
the global club membership had grown to 200 branches 
in 24 countries and with profits of over $25 million on 
turnover of over $100 million, it was considered the world’s 
wealthiest club. MUTV, the club’s own TV channel, and a 
large range of Internet sites fueled interest in the team. By 
2003 Manchester United had attracted an estimated global 
fan base of 53 million. 
 Major sponsorship deals with Nike and later Vodafone 
(at $15 million per year) boosted its finances and its glo-
bal brand footprint. The cross-border takeover by the 
US-based Glazer family in 2005 made the club even more 
international by any definition. Boosted by wins in the 
Premiership, the FA Cup and the European Champions 
League, the club’s fan base had grown to an estimated 
75 million worldwide. Significantly, 40 million of these 
were in Asia, compared to 23 million in Europe. Since 
then the actual number of global fans has been in dispute, 
ranging from ‘over 50 million’ to ‘over 300 million’. In 
2006–2007 Manchester United generated revenues of 
$212 million, second only to Real Madrid’s $236 million. 
Despite achieving revenues of $335 million in 2010, it has 
since been overtaken by Barcelona ($370 million) as well 
as Real Madrid (over $400 million). There are seven British 
clubs in the top twenty and four in the top ten, the others 
being Arsenal ($250 million), Chelsea ($230 million), and 
Liverpool ($205 million).  
 By this time the club had a range of regional sponsors, 
with PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Schick in North 
America, Ladbrokes in Europe, and Fuji Film and Air Asia 
in Asia. These were co-branding partners alongside global 
sponsors such as AIG, Vodafone, Nike, and Audi (and a 
few local partners like Dimension Data in South Africa). 
In some cases these have been the route to joint products 
and services, such as content services delivered by mobile 
phone to Manchester United fans through Vodafone. Pretax 
profits for the club are around  $60 million and turnover, 
including merchandising and media partnerships, is over 
$250 million. 
 Despite the fact that, on average, over half the team 
comprises foreign players who play against the England 
national team in the World Cup, and despite the fact that 
the clubs fan base is (in terms of pure numbers) more 
Asian than English, the passion for the club is still as 
strong as ever around Manchester. Global sports teams 
like Manchester United are embedded in local folklore, 
passionately discussed in bars and clubs around the world, 
part of the cultural identity of communities, but at the same 
time they are multinational businesses with global brands 
and international strategies.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 An understanding of international trade is critical to the study of 
international business. The primary objective of this chapter is to 
examine key economic theories that help to explain why nations 
trade. In addition, the role and importance of a country’s barriers to 
trade will be studied and discussion will focus on why most nations 
use trade barriers despite vigorous international efforts to eliminate 
them. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Define  the term  international trade  and discuss the role of 
mercantilism in modern international trade.  
 2  Contrast  the theories of absolute advantage and comparative 
advantage. 
 3  Relate  the importance of international product life cycle theory to 
the study of international economics.  
 4  Explain  some of the most commonly used barriers to trade and 
other economic developments that affect international economics.  
 5  Discuss  some of the reasons for the tensions between the theory of 
free trade and the widespread practice of national trade barriers.

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 Over the last three decades, new entrants into the world 
export market have transformed the economies of indus-
trialized countries and the types of products they export. 
At the beginning of this time period, the Japanese were a 
growing force in the international arena. They dominated 
the 1980s and were able to make substantial gains at the 
expense of such dominant exporters as the UK and the 
United States. Indeed, between 1980 and 1990, both these 
countries lost worldwide market share to the Japanese in 
such industries as automotive products, office machines, 
telecom equipment, machinery and transport equipment, 
chemicals, and textiles. 
 In the late 1980s, however, the world economy began to 
see major changes. Asia, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, 
Thailand, and China were growing much more competi-
tive on the world stage. South Korea, for example, started 
expanding its automotive industry, while China’s market 
share of office and telecom equipment rose from zero to 
about 1 percent of the market in 1990 to 4.5 percent by 2000; 
by 2009, it was 26 percent. Meanwhile, thanks to NAFTA—
which decreased barriers to trade within North America—
Mexico and Canada were increasing their market share of 
automotive products, machinery, and transport equipment. 
Such competition spurred the United States to radically 
restructure many of its industries; invest billions in new 
technology, plant, equipment, and information technology; 
and introduce improvement programs, such as Six Sigma, 
that allowed it to match the quality offerings of worldwide 
competitors. As a result, the US share of the world’s export 
market in areas such as automotive products, machinery 
and transport equipment, chemicals, and textiles somewhat 
recovered. The big loser was Japan, which saw its export 
market share decline in most of these areas. 
 Today the biggest challenge to the export markets of 
industrialized countries is China. Between 2000 and 2009, 
China’s share of the world’s merchandise exports more 
than doubled—from 4.7 percent to 9.9 percent (see  Table  1 ). 
This increase comes at the expense of exports by triad 
countries over the same period. By 2009, the core triad’s 
share of world exports was 54.7 percent, with the EU 
accounting for over two-third of this (see  Table  2 ). The 
United States and Japan were the hardest hit. 
 China’s expansion is particularly evident in the clothing 
and textile markets. In 2009, the country holds 34 percent 
and 28.3 percent of each market, respectively (see the first 
table). More impressive, however, are China’s improve-
ments in exports of office and telecom equipment and of 
 ACTIVE LEARNING CASE 
 Trade of the triad and China 
machinery and transport equipment, both of which require 
significant technology know-how.   
 As can been seen in the tables, China’s rise as a world 
exporter has decreased the share of the triad’s share of 
world exports in manufactures. In response to China’s 
increased competitiveness, triad countries are trying to 
balance the need to integrate this new player into the 
international business arena with the negative short-term 
effects to their economies. 
 Japan’s attitude toward China took a turn from protec-
tionism when it realized that this new trade partner could 
help it overcome some of the problems associated with its 
rigid economic system. Large amounts of inexpensive, low-
skilled labor now allowed Japanese companies to outsource 
some of their manufacturing operations overseas, within its

own region, while more skilled Japanese workers took care 
of the more specialized areas of the production process. In 
addition, China eased Japan’s long dependence on the US 
economy for its industrial and consumer products. 
 While US and EU companies have also moved operations 
to Japan, the governments are reacting more aggressively 
to pressure from special interest groups that see China 
as a threat to US businesses and jobs. The United States, 
which runs a large trade deficit with China, has argued 
that the yuan is undervalued, creating an unfair advantage 
for Chinese producers. The United States is threatening to 
impose tariffs on Chinese products. A bill is set to go before 
the Senate that would call for retaliatory trade sanctions 
against countries such as China that intervene to weaken 
their currencies in order to boost export at the expense 
of its trading partners. China relaxed the yuan’s fixed 
exchange rate against the dollar in June 2010, but since 
then it was allowed to appreciate by less than 3 percent. 
By November 2010, the exports to the United States were 
up to 29.5 percent compared to a year earlier. China export 
increased amid inflation fears. China’s November 2010 
in flation figure was set to hit a new 28-month high of 
5.1 percent versus October’s inflation figure of 4.4 percent 
and above the official inflation target of 3 percent. 
 Japan has joined this wagon and is pressuring China to 
move to a more flexible exchange rate. Yet, critics argue 
that no one truly knows the market value of the yuan and 
that a fall on its price after deregulation could only worsen 
matters. For its part, the EU has reacted by asking China 
to curtail exports of textiles into the union after exports of 
clothing increased by 534 percent in less than six months in 
2005. By November 2010, the overall figure was a 33 percent 
rise in exports to Europe. 
 An increase in exports by any nation does not necessarily 
mean that other countries are losing out. In terms of trade 
alone, any new entrant to the world exports market, other 
things being equal, will decrease the share of world exports 
of all other countries. This, however, does not mean that 
other countries are exporting less. They could be exporting, 
in value terms, a significantly higher amount because a new 
trade partner also means a new market to which they can 
export. More specifically, however, trade creates losers and 
winners. Triad economies are being forced to specialize. 
While those with most to lose pressure their governments 
to impose trade barriers, those with most to win—high-
skilled industries—are expanding to serve the Chinese 
market. Further, customers’ real incomes increase when 
they can purchase the same products at lower prices. 
 The data on this case help to reinforce an important prin-
ciple of international trade: specialize in those products in 
which you can achieve an advantage. Over time, of course, 
competitors may erode this advantage by developing even 
better offerings for the export market. In this case, it is 
important either to counterattack by improving your own 
offering to win back this market share, or to find other 
markets where the country’s skills and resources will 
allow it to compete effectively. In light of the emergence 
of more and more industrial countries in Asia, the growing 
competitiveness of Latin America, and the emerging indus-
tries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, triad 
managers have their work cut out for them.

 International trade

countries 
 International trade   is the branch of economics concerned with the exchange of goods and 
services with foreign countries. Although this is a complex subject, we will focus on two 
particular areas: international trade theory and barriers to trade.  
 Some international economic problems cannot be solved in the short run. Consider 
the US balance of trade deficit. US trade with Japan and China heavily affects its overall

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
imbalance. Moreover, this trade deficit will not be reduced by political measures alone; 
it will require long-run economic measures that reduce imports and increase exports. 
Other nations are also learning this lesson—and not just those that have negative balances. 
After all, most countries seem to want a continual favorable trade balance, although this 
is impossible, since a nation with a deficit must be matched by a nation with a surplus.       1 
 International trade has become an even more important topic now that so many 
countries have begun to move from state-run to market-driven economies.       2  Inflation 
and, in many cases, unemployment are severe problems for these nations. Fortunately, 
enhanced international trade is one way to address a weak macro economy.       3 International 
commitment to a free market will bring prosperity to the world economic system. Since the 
time of Adam Smith in 1790, economists have shown that free trade is efficient and leads 
to maximum economic welfare. In this chapter we will discuss the economic rationale for 
free trade and the political impediments to it.  
 To understand the topic of international trade, we must be able to answer the question: why 
do nations trade? One of the earliest and simplest answers to this question was provided 
by mercantilism, a theory that was quite popular in the eighteenth century, when gold was 
the only world currency.   Mercantilism   holds that a government can improve the economic 
well-being of the country by encouraging exports and stiﬂ ing imports. The result is a posi-
tive balance of trade that leads to wealth (gold) ﬂ owing into the country.  
 Neo-mercantilism  , like mercantilism, seeks to produce a positive balance of trade but 
without the reliance on precious metals. Most international trade experts believe that mer-
cantilism is a simplistic and erroneous theory, although it has had followers. For example, 
under President Mitterrand in the late 1970s and early 1980s, France sought to revitalize 
its industrial base by nationalizing key industries and banks and subsidizing exports over 
imports. By the mid-1980s the French government realized that the strategy was not work-
ing and began denationalizing many of its holdings. 4  More recently, China has proven to 
be a strong adherent of mercantilism, as reflected by the fact that it tries to have a positive 
balance with all of its trading partners.  
 A more useful explanation of why nations trade is provided by trade theories that focus on 
specialization of effort. The theories of absolute and comparative advantage are good examples. 
  Theory of absolute advantage 
 The  theory of absolute advantage   holds that nations can increase their economic well-
being by specializing in the production of goods they can produce more efﬁ ciently than 
anyone else. A simple example can illustrate this point. Assume that two nations, North and 
South, are both able to produce two goods, cloth and grain. Assume further that labor is the 
only scarce factor of production and thus the only cost.

 Thus lower labor-hours per unit of production means lower production costs and higher 
productivity per labor-hour. As seen by the data in the table, North has an absolute advan-
tage in the production of cloth since the cost requires only 10 labor-hours, compared to 

168
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
20 labor-hours in South. Similarly, South has an absolute advantage in the production of 
grain, which it produces at a cost of 10 labor-hours, compared to 20 labor-hours in North. 
 Both countries gain by trade. If they specialize and exchange cloth for grain at a relative 
price of 1:1, each country can employ its resources to produce a greater amount of goods. 
North can import one unit of grain in exchange for one unit of cloth, thereby paying only 
10 labor-hours for one unit of grain. If North had produced the grain itself, it would have 
used 20 labor-hours per unit, so North gains 10 labor-hours from the trade. In the same 
way, South gains from trade when it imports one unit of cloth in exchange for one unit of 
grain. The effective cost to South for one unit of cloth is only the 10 labor-hours required 
to make its one unit of grain. 
 The theory of absolute advantage, as originally formulated, does not predict the 
exchange ratio between cloth and grain once trade is opened, nor does it resolve the 
 division of the gains from trade between the two countries. Our example assumed an inter-
national price ratio of 1:1, but this ratio ( P cloth  to  P grain ) could lie between 2:1 (the pretrade 
price ratio in South) and 1:2 (the pretrade price ratio in North). To determine the relative 
price ratio under trade, we would have to know the total resources of each country (total 
labor-hours available per year), and the demand of each for both cloth and grain. In this 
way we could determine their relative gains from trade for each country. 
 Even this simple model of absolute advantage has several important implications for 
international trade. First, if a country has an absolute advantage in producing a product, 
it has the potential to gain from trade. Second, the more a country is able to specialize in 
the good it produces most efficiently, the greater its potential gains in national well-being. 
Third, the competitive market does not evenly distribute the gains from trade  within one 
country. This last implication is illustrated by the following example. 
 Prior to trade, the grain farmers in North work 20 hours to produce one unit of 
grain that could be exchanged for two units of cloth. After trade, those who remain can 
exchange one unit of grain for only one unit of cloth. Thus, the remaining grain pro-
ducers are worse off under trade. Cloth producers in North, however, work 10 hours, 
produce one unit of cloth, and exchange it for one unit of grain, whereas previously they 
received only half a unit of grain. They are better off. If grain producers in North switch 
to cloth production, then 20 hours of labor results in the production of two units of cloth, 
which they can exchange for two units of grain. Thus, international trade helps them. 
As long as North does not specialize completely in cloth, there will be gainers (cloth 
producers and grain producers who switched to cloth) and losers (those who continue 
as grain producers). 
 Because the nation as a whole benefits from trade, the gainers can compensate the losers 
and there will still be a surplus to be distributed in some way. If such compensation does 
not take place, however, the losers (continuing grain producers) would have an incentive 
to try to prevent the country from opening itself up to trade. Historically, this problem has 
continued to fuel opposition to a free trade policy that reduces barriers to trade. A good 
example is Japanese farmers who stand to lose their livelihood if the government opens up 
Japan to lower-priced agricultural imports. 
 A more complicated picture of the determinants and effects of trade emerges when 
one of the trading partners has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods. 
However, trade under these conditions still brings gains, as David Ricardo first demon-
strated in his theory of comparative advantage.  
  Theory of comparative advantage 
 The  theory of comparative   advantage holds that nations should produce those goods for 
which they have the greatest relative advantage. In terms of the previous example of two

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
countries, North and  South, and two commodities, cloth and grain, Ricardo’s model can be 
illustrated as follows: 
 Labor cost (hours) of production for one unit 
 
 Cloth 
 Grain 
 North 
 50 
 100 
 South 
 200 
 200 
 In this example North has an absolute advantage in the production of  both  cloth and grain, 
so it would appear at ﬁ rst sight that trade would be unproﬁ table, or at least that incentives 
for exchange no longer exist. Yet trade is still advantageous to both nations, provided their 
 relative costs of production differ. 
 Before trade, one unit of cloth in North costs (50/100) hours of grain, so one unit of 
cloth can be exchanged for half a unit of grain. The price of cloth is half the price of grain. 
In South, one unit of cloth costs (200/200) hours of grain, or one grain unit. The price 
of cloth equals the price of grain. If North can import more than half a unit of grain for 
one unit of cloth, it will gain from trade. Similarly, if South can import one unit of cloth 
for less than one unit of grain, it will also gain from trade. These relative price ratios set 
the boundaries for trade. Trade is profitable between price ratios (price of cloth to price 
of grain) of 0.5 and 1. For example, at an international price ratio of two-thirds, North 
gains. It can import one unit of grain in return for exporting one and a half units of cloth. 
Because it costs only 50 hours of labor to produce the unit of cloth, its effective cost under 
trade for one unit of imported grain is 75 labor-hours. Under pretrade conditions it costs 
North 100 labor-hours to produce one unit of grain. Similarly, South gains from trade by 
importing one unit of cloth in exchange for two-thirds of a unit of grain. Prior to trade, 
South spent 200 labor-hours producing the one unit of cloth. Through trade, its effective 
cost for one unit of cloth is   2 _ 
3   200, or 133 labor-hours—cheaper than the domestic 
production cost of 200 labor-hours. Assuming free trade between the two nations, North 
will tend to specialize in the production of cloth, and South will tend to specialize in the 
production of grain. 
 This example illustrates a general principle. There are gains from trade whenever the 
relative price ratios of two goods differ under international exchange from what they 
would be under conditions of no trade. Such domestic conditions are often referred to as 
 autarky , which is a government policy of being totally self-sufficient. Research shows that 
free trade is superior to autarky. In particular, free trade provides greater economic output 
and consumption to the trade partners jointly than they can achieve by working alone. By 
specializing in the production of certain goods, exporting those products for which they 
have a comparative advantage, and importing those for which they have a comparative 
disadvantage, the countries end up being better off. 
 The general conclusions of the theory of comparative advantage are the same as those 
for the theory of absolute advantage. In addition, the theory of comparative advantage 
demonstrates that countries jointly benefit from free trade (under the assumptions of the 
model) even if one has an absolute advantage in the production of  both  goods. Total world 
efficiency and consumption increase. 
 As with the theory of absolute advantage discussed previously, Ricardo’s theory of 
comparative advantage does not answer the question of the distribution of gains between 
the two countries, nor the distribution of gains and losses between grain producers and 
cloth producers within each country. No country will lose under free trade, but in theory 
at least all the gains could accrue to one country and to only one group within that 
country.   

170
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Factor endowment theory 
 In recent years more sophisticated theories have emerged that help clarify and extend our 
knowledge of international trade. The   factor endowment theory   holds that countries will 
produce and export products that use large amounts of production factors that they have 
in abundance, and they will import products requiring large amounts of production fac-
tors that they lack. This theory is also known as the   Heckscher–Ohlin theory (after the two 
economists who ﬁ rst developed it). The theory is useful in extending the concept of com-
parative advantage by bringing into consideration the endowment and cost of production 
factors. The theory also helps explain why nations with relatively large labor forces, such 
as China, will concentrate on producing labor-intensive goods, whereas countries like the 
Netherlands, which has relatively more capital than labor, will specialize in capital-intensive 
goods.  
 However, the factor endowment theory has some weaknesses. One weakness is that 
some countries have minimum wage laws that result in high prices for relatively abundant 
labor. As a result, they may find it less expensive to import certain goods than to produce 
them internally. Another weakness is that countries like the United States export rela-
tively more labor-intensive goods and import capital-intensive goods, an outcome that 
appears surprising. This result, discovered by Wassily Leontief, a Nobel Prize-winning 
economist, is known as the   Leontief paradox   and has been explained in terms of the 
quality of labor input rather than just labor-hours of work. The United States produces 
and exports technology-intensive products that require highly educated labor. The 
Leontief paradox not only shows one of the problems with factor endowment theory, but 
also helps us understand why no single theory can explain the role of economic factors 
in trade theory. Simply put, the subject is too complex to be explained with just one or 
two theories.   
  International product life cycle theory 
 Another theory that provides insights into international theory is Vernon’s   international 
product life cycle (IPLC) theory  , which addresses the various stages of a good’s life cycle. 
In particular, the theory helps explain why a product that begins as a nation’s export often 
ends up becoming an import. The theory also focuses on market expansion and technolog-
ical innovation, concepts that are relatively de-emphasized in comparative advantage theory.

How does the process of the UK’s finding market niches help illustrate the 
theory of comparative advantage? 
 The theory of comparative advantage holds that nations should produce those goods 
for which they have the greatest relative advantage. The finding of market niches helps 
illustrate this theory because it shows that the UK is picking those areas in which it 
has a relative advantage over the competition and exploiting its strengths in those 
markets. Given the rise of competitiveness in all areas of worldwide exports, few nations 
have been able to maintain their market share for very long. So the UK will have to con-
tinue to use this approach in order to remain one of the world’s major export nations.

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
IPLC theory has two important tenets: (1) technology is a critical factor in creating and 
developing new products; and (2) market size and structure are important in determining 
trade patterns.   
 Product stages 
 The IPLC has three stages: new product, maturing product, and standardized product. A 
new product is one that is innovative or unique in some way (see  Figure   6.1   a). Initially, con-
sumption is in the home country, price is inelastic, proﬁ ts are high, and the company seeks 
to sell to those willing to pay a premium price. As production increases and outruns local 
consumption, exporting begins. 
 As the product enters the mature phase of its life cycle (see  Figure   6.1   b), an increasing 
percentage of sales is achieved through exporting. At the same time, competitors in other 
advanced countries will be working to develop substitute products so they can replace the 
initial good with one of their own. The introduction of these substitutes and the softening 
of demand for the original product will eventually result in the firm that developed the 
product now switching its strategy from production to market protection. Attention will 
also be focused on tapping markets in less developed countries. 
 As the product enters the standardized product stage (see  Figure   6.1   c), the technology 
becomes widely diffused and available. Production tends to shift to low-cost locations, 
including less developed countries and offshore locations. In many cases the product will 
end up being viewed as a generic, and price will be the sole determinant of demand.  
  Personal computers and the IPLC 
 In recent years a number of products have moved through the IPLC and are now in the 
standardized product stage. Personal computers (PCs) are a good example, despite their 
wide variety and the fact that some versions are in the new product and maturing product 
phases. For example, the early version of PCs that reached the market in the 1984 to 1991 
period were in the standardized product stage by 1995 and sold primarily on the basis 
of price. Machines that entered the market in the 1996 to 1998 period were in the maturing 
stage by 1999. PCs with increased memory capability that were in the new product stage in 
1999 quickly moved toward maturity, and by 2002 they were being replaced by even better 
machines with faster processors and more multimedia capabilities. Today, diskettes are 
standardized and rarely used while standard components include CD writers, DVD ROMs,

DSL and wireless Internet connectors, USB ports, advanced graphics and sound, ﬂ at LCD 
monitors, digital photography capabilities, etc. 
 Desktop computers have been replaced by laptop models that are lighter, faster, more 
sophisticated, and less expensive than their predecessors. In turn, these machines are being 
replaced by notebooks with advanced Pentium chips, long-term battery capability, and 
storage capable of holding billions of bytes complete with wireless equipment and serve as 
a complete communications center from which the international executive can communi-
cate anywhere in the world. These machines will first be manufactured locally and then in 
foreign markets. This is largely because IBM (the inventor of the PC) computers became a 
commodity, and IBM’s PC division was sold to the Chinese firm Lenovo in 2005. Lenovo 
has the benefit of low labor costs and it is better able to manufacture the laptops of today. 
Thus, computers will continue to move through an IPLC. 
 The IPLC theory is useful in helping to explain how new technologically innovative 
products fit into the world trade picture. However, because new innovative products are 
sometimes rapidly improved, it is important to remember that one or two versions of them 
may be in the standardized product stage while other versions are in the maturing stage 
and still others are in the new product phase.   
 Other important considerations 
 Many factors beyond those we have considered greatly inﬂ uence international trade theory. 5 
One is government regulation. Countries often limit or restrict trade with other countries 
for political reasons. For example, despite the beneﬁ ts of international trade, the EU does 
not always see eye to eye with the United States on regulatory matters. As a result there are 
different government regulations affecting business in Europe, than in North America. For 
example, EU competition policy differs from US antitrust policy, see the box  International 
Business Strategy in Action: Microsoft shows the world is not ﬂ at . Other important fac-
tors include monetary currency valuation and consumer tastes. 
 Monetary currency valuation 
 When examining why one country trades with another, we need to consider the  monetary 
exchange rate  , which is the price of one currency stated in terms of another currency. For 
example, from 1995 to 1998 the value of the Japanese yen declined signiﬁ cantly over the 
value of the US dollar. As a result, many Japanese businesses found their products becoming 
much more competitive in the US market. Thereafter, the Japanese government announced 
that because the yen was again getting too strong, it wanted to weaken its value, thus ensur-
ing that Japanese businesses could maintain their international competitiveness. Another 
reason why monetary currency valuation is important is because a foreign ﬁ rm doing busi-
ness will report its revenues and proﬁ ts in home-country currency. So if a British ﬁ rm 
sold $10 million of machinery in Canada and the value of the Canadian dollar declined 
against the British pound, the UK company would report less revenue (in terms of British 
pounds) than if the Canadian dollar had remained stable or, better yet, increased in value 
against the pound. In mid-2005, the euro became so strong compared to the dollar that 
Volkswagen reported a 63 percent decline in pre tax proﬁ ts. 6  In the next chapter we will 
discuss exchange rates in more detail.   
 Consumer tastes 
 International trade is not based solely on price; some people will pay more for a product 
even though they can buy something similar for less money. This willingness to pay more 
may be based on prestige, perceived quality, or a host of other physical and psychological 
reasons. Personal tastes dictate consumer decisions.

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 Microsoft shows the world is not flat 
 The dispute between Microsoft and the European 
Commission demonstrates that the world is not flat. 
Microsoft is a company that has ridden the wave of world-
wide Internet access and software applications. Yet, it has 
run into a brick wall in Brussels. There the EU Directorate 
General for Competition and State Aid (DG Comp) has 
imposed large fines for breaking its competition rules. 
 In March 2004, the DG Comp ruled that Microsoft is abus-
ing its dominant market position with its Windows operat-
ing system. Since then the DG Comp has been threatening 
to impose large daily fines because it says Microsoft is 
failing to comply with that ruling. On September 17, 2007, 
Microsoft lost an appeal to the European Court of First 
Instance ending a nine-year battle with the EU. It paid 
fines to the EU of $1.4 billion. In December 2007, the EU 
launched a new antitrust investigation against Microsoft 
after Norway’s Opera complained about web browser. In 
January 2009, EU Commission accused Microsoft of ille-
gally tying Internet Explorer to Windows. The Commission’s 
concern was that the US computer giant may have broken 
competition rules by bundling its web browser with its 
dominant Windows operating system. Internet Explorer 
is used by more than half of global business users, with 
Mozila’s Firefox at about 32 percent and Norway’s Opera 
with 2 percent. In July 2009, Microsoft reached an agree-
ment with EU antitrust regulators to allow European users 
a choice of web browsers. The accord ended 10 years of 
dispute between the two sides. Over that time, the EU 
imposed fines totalling €1.68 bn ($2.44bn, £1.5bn). The 
European Commission said Microsoft’s legally binding 
agreement ended the dispute and averted a possible fine 
for the company.  
 This case illustrates that even the world’s most success-
ful Internet-based software company does not have unre-
stricted global market access for its products. Instead, the 
world is divided into a ‘triad’ with strong barriers for entry 
into the key regional markets of the EU, North America, 
and Asia–Pacific. Microsoft is simply the latest large MNE 
to misread the world marketplace. Today, business activ-
ity is organized mainly within each region of the triad, not 
globally. For US firms, going to a foreign triad market in 
Europe and Asia is fraught with peril. 
 The world’s 500 largest firms, on average, sell 72 per-
cent of their goods and services in their home region. Very 
few firms are truly global, defined as selling a significant 
percent of their products in each triad region. For example, 
the world’s largest firm, Wal-Mart, has 94 percent of its 
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
sales in North America. Microsoft discloses the geographic 
dispersion of its sales by geographic segments: sales in 
the United States and sales outside the United States. Over 
five years’ average (2006–2010), Microsoft generates 60 per-
cent of its sales in the United States alone. If sales in 
Canada and Mexico are added on top of US sales, it is likely 
that a majority of its sales is in North America. Firms like 
Wal-Mart and Microsoft need to understand that a busi-
ness model developed for North America will need to be 
adapted when going to Europe and Asia.     
 In the case of Microsoft the key difference is in the 
way that the EU regulatory system operates. In Europe 
competi tion policy can be used as a barrier to entry. EU 
antitrust regulations have traditionally proven stricter 
than American ones. An individual firm (in this case, Sun 
Microsystems and Opera) can signal an EU-wide investi-
gation. In this process the deck is stacked against the 
 foreign firm. In 2001 the US firm General Electric also made 
a similar mistake in its planned acquisition of Honeywell 
which was disallowed by the EU. 
 While the United States has somewhat similar antitrust 
provisions, the application of these is more business 
friendly than in Europe. US antitrust aims to help con-
sumers, whereas EU law helps competitors. Microsoft was 
able to settle its antitrust case with the Bush adminis-
tration, but it failed to do so with the EU. The regulatory 
climate in Europe is harsher than in North America. 
Multinational firms like Microsoft which assume free trade, 
worldwide market entry, and the other aspects of flat earth 
thinking are learning expensive lessons. In addition to

How does an EU manager’s desire to buy domestic products illustrate the 
importance of consumer taste in international markets? 
 This example shows that people often buy goods based on personal preference, rather 
than only on such characteristics as low price, high quality, or improved productivity. 
Of course, this “Buy EU” focus will often come into play only when all other factors are 
approximately equal. The manager is unlikely to turn down a China-made product that is 
30 percent less expensive in favor of one that is made domestically. So there are limits 
to the effects of consumer taste on purchase decisions, though it is certainly one variable 
that has proven very important in international trade.   
differences in regulatory standards across the triad, there 
are major cultural, social, and political differences that 
deny globalization.  
 In terms of regulatory differences antitrust is but one 
of an array of market-entry barriers. Even worse are anti-
dumping and countervailing duty laws which are used to 
keep out foreign rivals. The United States itself administers 
its antidumping and countervailing duty laws in favor of the 
home team. In 2006, on security grounds, the US Congress 
overturned the executive branch decision to allow Dubai 
Ports International to acquire the US ports owned by P&O, 
a British firm. The Europeans perceive that the US commit-
ment to free trade is weak; this is stiffening their spine with 
regard to Microsoft. The end result is typical triad-based 
economic warfare, where market entry is denied by the 
local bureaucrats and politicians. 
 While the US system is transparent, the EU investiga-
tion of unfair trade law cases, as well as antitrust, can 
be opaque and self-serving. The EU bureaucrats have 
continued the case against Microsoft even after Sun 
Microsystems and other business rivals in Europe, like 
Novell and Real Networks, have settled their disputes. So 
now we can see the EU, as an institution, fighting a foreign 
multinational. Not exactly a flat world. 
 The lessons of the Microsoft case are the following. 
First, globalization is a myth; instead world business is 
conducted mainly on an intra-regional basis within each 
part of the triad. Second, it is unlikely that the regulatory 
standards across the triad will be harmonized; thus, multi-
nationals must be prepared to adapt their business models 
when they enter foreign regions of the triad. Third, even 
in high-tech areas such as software Internet applications, 
the technology itself does not guarantee the flat promise 
of worldwide market access. The world is not flat; rather, 
there are very strong regional fault lines.

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 Quota 
  A quantity limit on imported 
goods 
 Embargo 
  A quota set at zero, thus 
preventing the importation 
of those products that are 
involved 
 Why do many countries produce goods and services that could be purchased more cheaply 
from others? One reason is trade barriers, which effectively raise the cost of these goods and 
make them more expensive to local buyers. 
  Reasons for trade barriers 
 One of the most common reasons for the creation of trade barriers is to encourage local 
production by making it more difﬁ cult for foreign ﬁ rms to compete there. Another reason 
is to help local ﬁ rms export and thus build worldwide market share by doing such things 
as providing them with subsidies in the form of tax breaks and low-interest loans. Other 
common reasons include: 
 1  Protect local jobs by shielding home-country business from foreign competition.  
 2  Encourage local production to replace imports. 
 3  Protect infant industries that are just getting started. 
 4  Reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. 
 5  Encourage local and foreign direct investment. 
 6  Reduce balance of payments problems. 
 7  Promote export activity. 
 8  Prevent foreign firms from  dumping  (selling goods below cost in order to achieve 
market share).  
 9   Promote political objectives such as refusing to trade with countries that practice 
apartheid or deny civil liberties to their citizens.    
 Commonly used barriers 
 A variety of trade barriers deter the free ﬂ ow of international goods and services. 7 The 
following presents six of the most commonly used barriers. 
 Price-based barriers 
 Imported goods and services sometimes have a tariff added to their price. Quite often this 
is based on the value of the goods. For example, some tobacco products coming into the 
United States carry an ad valorem tariff (see below) of over 100 percent, thus more than 
doubling their cost to US consumers. Tariffs raise revenues for the government, discourage 
imports, and make local goods more attractive. 
 Quantity limits 
 Quantity limits, often known as   quotas  , restrict the number of units that can be imported 
or the market share that is permitted. If the quota is set at zero, as in the case of Cuban 
cigars from Havana to the United States, it is called an  embargo . If the annual quota is 
set at 1 million units, no more than this number can be imported during one year; once 
it is reached, all additional imports are turned back. In some cases a quota is established 
in terms of market share. For example, Canada allows foreign banks to hold no more than 
16 percent of Canadian bank deposits, and the EU limits Japanese auto imports to 10 per-
cent of the total market.   
 BARRIERS TO TRADE

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 International price fixing 
 Sometimes a host of international ﬁ rms will ﬁ x prices or quantities sold in an effort to control 
price. This is known as a   cartel . A well-known example is OPEC (Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries), which consists of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela, 
among others (see  Table   6.1   ). By controlling the supply of oil it provides, OPEC seeks to con-
trol both price and proﬁ t. This practice is illegal in the United States and Europe, 8  but the basic 
idea of allowing competitors to cooperate for the purpose of meeting international compe-
tition is being endorsed more frequently in countries such as the United States.       9  For example, 
US computer ﬁ rms have now created partnerships for joint research and development efforts.   
 Non-tariff barriers 
 Non-tariff barriers are rules, regulations, and bureaucratic red tape that delay or preclude 
the purchase of foreign goods. Examples include (1) slow processing of import permits, 
(2) the establishment of quality standards that exclude foreign producers, and (3) a “buy 
local” policy. These barriers limit imports and protect domestic sales.    
 Financial limits 
 There are a number of different ﬁ nancial limits. One of the most common is  exchange 
controls  , which restrict the ﬂ ow of currency. For example, a common exchange con-
trol is to limit the currency that can be taken out of the country; for example, travelers 
may take up to only $3,000 per person out of the country. Another example is the use of 
ﬁ xed exchange rates that are quite favorable to the country. For example, dollars may be 
exchanged for local currency on a 1:1 basis; without exchange controls, the rate would be 
1:4. These cases are particularly evident where a black market exists for foreign currency 
that offers an exchange rate much different from the ﬁ xed rate.   
 Foreign investment controls 
 Foreign investment controls   are limits on foreign direct investment or the transfer or remit-
tance of funds. These controls can take a number of different forms, including (1) requir-
ing foreign investors to take a minority ownership position (49 percent or less), (2) limiting 
proﬁ t remittance (such as to 15 percent of accumulated capital per year), and (3) prohibiting 
royalty payments to parent companies, thus stopping the latter from taking out capital.  
 Such barriers can greatly restrict international trade and investment. However, it must 
be realized that they are created for what governments believe are very important reasons. 
A close look at one of these, tariffs, helps to make this clearer.

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 Tariffs 
 A  tariff   is a tax on goods that are shipped internationally. The most common is the   import 
tariff , which is levied on goods shipped into a country. 10  Less common is the   export tariff , 
for goods sent out of the country, or a   transit tariff   for goods passing through the country. 
These taxes are levied on a number of bases. A   speciﬁ c duty   is a tariff based on units, such 
as $1 for each item shipped into the country. So a manufacturer shipping in 1,000 pairs of 
shoes would pay a speciﬁ c duty of $1,000. An   ad valorem duty   is a tariff based on a per-
centage of the value of the item, so a watch valued at $25 and carrying a 10 percent duty 
would have a tariff of $2.50. A   compound duty   is a tariff consisting of both a speciﬁ c and 
an ad valorem duty, so a suit of clothes valued at $80 that carries a speciﬁ c duty of $3 and 
an ad valorem duty of 5 percent would have a compound duty of $7.        
 Governments typically use tariffs to raise revenue and/or to protect local industry. 
At the same time, these taxes decrease demand for the respective product while raising 
the price to the buyer. This is illustrated in  Figure   6.2   , which shows how the quantity 
demanded declines from  Q 1  to  Q 2  when a tariff drives the price of a good from  P 1  to  P 2 
(the world price plus the tariff). This price increase allows local producers to sell  Q 3 Q 2 and 
thus take market share away from foreign firms that were exporting  Q 3 Q 1 into the country. 
However, the figure shows this is done at the price of charging the consumer more money 
 and  reducing the number of buyers who purchase the product. At new price  P 2 , there are 
no longer any imports.  
 There are numerous reasons for using tariffs, such as to protect domestic industries 
or firms. The US government has used them to prevent foreign companies from selling 
goods at lower prices in the United States than back home. US auto makers have often 
accused their overseas rivals of using this tactic. In the case of Japanese car manufacturers, 
this was a particularly troublesome area when the value of the yen rose sharply in the early 
1990s. As a result, argued the US car companies, imported parts and cars had to reflect the 
increased value of the yen or be subjected to tariffs. 11  Others have made similar arguments. 
Eastman Kodak, for example, asked the US Commerce Department to impose steep tariffs 
on the Fuji Photo Film Company. Kodak’s argument was partially based on the rising yen. 
However, it also reflected a concern with  dumping , which is the selling of imported goods 
at a price below cost or below that in the home country. In this case Kodak argued that 
Fuji sold color photographic paper for less than 20 cents a square foot in the United States, 
while charging almost 60 cents a square foot in Japan.       12 For an example of a protectionist 
tariff, see the box  International Business Strategy in Action: The courier wars .

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 The courier wars 
 Local businesses have many reasons for encouraging 
their governments to erect barriers to trade. One of the 
most common is when an industry is not competitive on a 
worldwide basis and foreign competition could bring about 
the bankruptcy of local firms. The US steel industry is a 
good example. The efficiencies of both West European and 
Japanese steelmakers have brought new challenges to the 
US steel industry, which asked President George W. Bush 
to protect it from foreign imports. 
 Sometimes, however, local firms will seek protection from 
foreign competition even though they are profitable. Why? 
Because they don’t want to give up any of their local market 
share—which will happen if more entrants are allowed into 
the industry. A good example is found in the courier wars 
now being fought in the United States. The three firms 
involved are FedEx, UPS, and DHL Express. The first two are 
US companies that collectively control 80 percent of the US 
market. The other is a German company that holds very 
little of the market. The total sales in 2009 of UPS are 
$45.297 billion; for FedEx, $34.734 billion; while for DHL 
Express there are no data except for its parent firm, 
Deutsche Post AG, at $64.253 billion. 
 FedEx operates out of Memphis, Tennessee, where it 
has a major distribution hub and a large number of aircraft 
to help meet its commitment of one-day delivery. UPS’s 
airport hub is in Atlanta, Georgia, while DHL’s hub is near 
Miami, Florida. All three firms do business in Europe, 
where they are also profitable. FedEx and UPS have been 
trying to prevent DHL from building an air fleet business 
in the United States to deliver packages and mail just 
like they do. Moreover, the two giant US firms have been 
receiving support from the Department of Transportation, 
which they have lobbied to prevent DHL from getting an 
air license. 
 One of the arguments made by FedEx and UPS is that 
although DHL Airways is 100 percent US owned, the parent 
company is controlled through an agreement by German 
owners with DHL’s US subsidiary. This latter arrangement 
might seem a little strange, but a similar situation exists 
in Canada. The largest courier service in that country is 
Purolator, which is owned by the Canadian Post Office, a 
Crown monopoly. Yet despite this monopoly, both FedEx 
and UPS do quite well in Canada. US law, however, does not 
allow foreign entities to own more than 49 percent of the 
equity and 25 percent of the voting stock of a US air carrier. 
 Deutsche Post circumvented these regulations by sell-
ing a controlling stake of DHL Airways to an American 
with large stakes in DHL’s international operations. Critics 
claimed that DHL Airways had entered into an agreement 
with Deutsche Post to be a captive vendor and that in prac-
tical terms Deutsche Post owned DHL. The Department 
of Transportation then forced DHL Airways to expand its 
contracts outside of DHL.   
 In 2003, DHL sought to expand its airline capacity by 
integrating Seattle-based Airborne’s airline fleet. FedEx 
and UPS once again appealed to the Department of 
Transportation and to US politicians claiming that despite 
the new company being 100 percent owned by public 
shareholders, it would follow the same strategy that DHL 
Airways always did: working under an exclusive agreement 
with DHL.  
 In June 2003, DHL Airways Chairman and CEO were 
leading a US investor group in a buyout of the freight 
airline, whose largest customer was package-delivery 
company DHL Worldwide Express. DHL Airways moved 
to Miami from Chicago. They paid $57 million to buy the 
95 percent of the airline which was owned by a subsidiary 
of Germany’s Deutsche Post AG and two American private 
investors. The purchase put to rest a controversy about the 
company’s ownership. The company changed its name to 
ASTAR Air Cargo.  
 The Dutch TNT (with worldwide sales of $17 billion) is 
emerging in 2007 as another foreign competitor with its US 
hub in Chicago. 
 In 2003, John Bartholdi, a Georgia Tech logistics profes-
sor, and his 60 students began the annual Great Package 
Race to determine which carrier is most efficient in deliv-
ering packages to worldwide locations. DHL Express is 
frequently the winner. In 2009, again, DHL Express was the

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 Another reason for using tariffs is to raise government revenue. Import tariffs, for example, 
are a major source of revenue for less developed countries. A third reason is to reduce citi-
zens’ foreign expenditures in order to improve the country’s balance of payments. 
 Tariffs continue to be one of the most commonly used barriers to trade, despite the fact 
that they often hurt low-income consumers and have a limited impact, if any, on upper-
income purchasers. In recent years most industrialized countries have tried to reduce or 
eliminate the use of these trade barriers and to promote more free trade policies.       13 The 
United States is a good example. (The trade policies of the EU are discussed in  Chapter 17  
and those of Japan in  Chapter 18 .)  
 US trade policy 
 Despite being a highly protectionist nation in its early years, the United States has a policy 
today that generally strives to lower tariffs and trade barriers through the use of multilat-
eral agreements. Since the protectionist disaster of the Depression years, the United States 
has sought to minimize the use of tariffs. It supported the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT), and now it supports the 1994 World Trade Organization (WTO), which 
exists to liberalize trade and investment. Today US tariffs average only 2 to 3 percent adval-
orem to most countries of the world. 14 
 The move away from tariffs does not mean US trade policy is completely open.       15 
The US government employs a variety of approaches to promote or discourage inter-
national trade. For example, to encourage trade, there is the  North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) , which eliminates most trade restrictions (such as tariffs) among the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico and extends national treatment to foreign investment, 
and the   Caribbean Basin Initiative  , which eliminates tariffs on many imports from the 
Caribbean and Central American regions. Yet the  Trading-with-the-Enemy Act disallows 
trade with countries judged to be enemies of the United States, including North Korea 
and Cuba. The US administration has the authority to prevent sales of goods to foreign 
governments when they are not deemed to be in the best interests of the United States. 
These goods can range from computers to chemicals to materials used for making nuclear 
weapons. 16    
 The United States has also used negotiated agreements to limit the type or number of 
products entering the country. For example, a voluntary agreement with Japan restricts 
the number of cars imported to the United States. At the same time, exports are encour-
aged through legislation such as the   Foreign Sales Corporation Act  , which allows US 
exporters to establish overseas affiliates and not to pay taxes on the affiliates’ income until 
the earnings are remitted to the parent company. The government also offers   trade 
adjustment assistance   to US businesses and individuals who are harmed by competition 
from imports. This aid takes such forms as loans for retooling and job counseling for those 
seeking alternative employment.

In what way could the EU use trade barriers to protect its markets from 
foreign competitors? Who can be affected by these trade barriers? 
 The EU could take a number of steps to protect its markets from foreign competitors. 
Examples include establishing or increasing ad valorem tariffs, placing quantity limits on 
various imports, and limiting foreign direct investment. Of course, other countries could 
retaliate and take similar action against EU-produced goods, so the use of these trade 
barriers must be selective and should not be undertaken unless efforts at negotiated 
agreements prove fruitless.   
 The economic effects of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade are roughly similar to those of 
tariffs. They are inefﬁ cient distortions that reduce potential gains from trade.  Table   6.2    lists 
a wide range of NTBs. 
 NTBs have gained prominence and importance in recent years as nations have begun 
resorting to them more frequently for protection. Sometimes they are not imposed by 
countries to interfere deliberately with trade. 17  Rather, they arise out of domestic policy 
and economic management. Examples include tax breaks to reduce regional income 
disparities or regulations designed to increase local purchasing or employment. These, in 
turn, result in a type of indirect export subsidy. Other NTBs are more blatant devices that 
restrict imports or foster exports. 
 Quotas 
 The most important NTBs are quotas that restrict imports to a particular level.       18 When a 
quota is imposed, domestic production generally increases and prices rise. As a result, the 
government usually ends up losing tariff revenues.

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 Historically, the GATT and WTO have prohibited import quotas except on agricultural 
products, as emergency measures, or when a country has short-run balance of payments 
problems. Countries have circumvented this regulation most notably for textiles, footwear, 
and automobiles by negotiating voluntary export restraint agreements that are useful in 
preventing retaliatory action by the importing country. In general, business would rather 
be protected by quotas than by tariffs. Under quotas, if future domestic demand is known, 
companies can determine their future production levels. Under tariffs, domestic producers 
must estimate the elasticity of the demand curve for imported products and the future 
movements in world prices, which is a more difficult challenge.   
 “Buy national” restrictions 
 “Buy national” regulations require governments to give preference to domestic producers, 
sometimes to the complete exclusion of foreign ﬁ rms. In Europe, for example, many of 
the telephone, telegraph, electric utility, airline, and railroad industries are government 
owned and buy from national ﬁ rms only, thus closing a large market to exporters. On 
the other hand, countries like the United States have a similarly wide range of inefﬁ cient 
“BuyAmerican” regulations at the national and state levels that discriminate against foreign 
suppliers. During the 1970s Tokyo Round of the GATT negotiations, a mild code to open 
up government contracts to foreign suppliers was negotiated. Only 28 governments have 
agreed to the WTO’s Government Procurement Agreement and these must now publicize 
large procurement contracts to make public the winner’s bid price or the basis for selecting 
the winning bid. 
 Customs valuation 
 Also during the GATT Tokyo Round, considerable progress was made in the area of cus-
toms valuation for the payment of duties. In the United States, there were nine valuation 
systems prior to the Tokyo Round. Value for duty is now generally based on the invoice cost, 
and the latitude of US customs to reclassify products has been reduced. 
 Technical barriers 
 Product and process standards for health, welfare, safety, quality, size, and measurements 
can create trade barriers by excluding products that do not meet them. Testing and certi-
ﬁ cation procedures, such as testing only in the importing country and conducting on-site 
plant inspections, are cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive. The costs must be 
borne by the exporter prior to the foreign sale. National governments have the right and 
duty to protect their citizens by setting standards to prevent the sale of hazardous prod-
ucts. But such standards can also be used to impede trade. For example, at one point Japan 
excluded US-made baseball bats from the market because they did not meet the country’s 
standard. No product produced outside Japan (even products made by foreign subsidiaries 
of Japanese MNEs) could bear the certiﬁ cation stamp of the Japanese Industrial Standard 
(JIS) or the Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS), and selling in Japan without the JIS or 
JAS logo was difﬁ cult. Similarly, at one time the new regulations for automobile safety in 
the United States required that bumpers be above the height practical for imported sub-
compact cars, thus creating a technical barrier for these car manufacturers. Today the new 
code on technical barriers to trade requires consultation between trading partners before a 
standard that impedes trade is put in place. The code also requires that testing and certiﬁ -
cation procedures treat imports and domestic goods equally and that the importing country 
accept certiﬁ cation testing conducted in the exporting country.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
  Antidumping legislation, subsidies, and countervailing duties 
 The GATT and WTO allow importing countries to protect their producers from unfair 
competition, such as “dumping” goods at extremely low prices in an effort to gain market 
share and to drive out local competition. Importing countries are allowed to impose 
ad ditional duties on products that have received export subsidies or are “dumped.” Before 
the duties are imposed, however, the country must show that its domestic industry has 
 suffered “material” injury from dumped or subsidized imports. Although products at these 
artiﬁ cially low prices provide consumers in the importing country with a “good buy,” such 
competition is thought to be unfair to domestic producers who object to dumping (and 
also to subsidized imports that can be offset by “countervailing” duties) if the domestic 
market of the exporting country is closed to them. A good example is the US auto industry, 
which claims that some Japanese cars are cheaper in the US market than at home, while 
Japan continues to impede exports of US cars into Japan. 
 The GATT and the WTO have developed a code on countervailing duties and anti-
dumping duties that now expedites the process of determining whether exports have been 
dumped or subsidized and whether the domestic industry has been injured. This subject is 
exceedingly complex. Here are some examples (and answers): 
 If the EU remits value-added taxes on exports by EU producers, is this a subsidy? ( No ) 
 If Canada subsidizes production in a specific sector in one of its depressed regions 
for domestic purposes, are the exports of a subsidized firm subject to countervailing 
action? ( Yes ) 
 If the British government subsidizes the British steel industry and its losses incurred by 
selling at home and abroad at prices below full cost, are its exports subject to antidump-
ing or to countervailing duties? ( Maybe, sometimes ) 
 The problem is complex because of the difficulty in determining what material injury 
is and how it should be measured. This area is likely to be a point of contention for years 
to come. 
 Agricultural products 
 Trade in agricultural products is highly regulated by both quotas and ﬁ xed and variable 
tariffs. Domestic producers in most industrialized countries are often highly subsidized 
both directly and by artiﬁ cially high domestic prices. Agricultural exports are often subsi-
dized as well. And the EU ﬂ atly refused to discuss its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 
at the Tokyo Round. The CAP sets variable tariffs on imports to maintain high domestic 
prices by excluding or impeding imports. Major reforms in the CAP are now underway that 
will see continuing support for farmers but independently of production volumes. This is 
expected to improve the EU’s negotiating position at the WTO. The United States is not 
without guilt in this area, however, since it also subsidizes the export of many agricultural 
products. The countries most affected by these subsidies are less developed countries with 
abundant and inexpensive labor and land and thus a competitive advantage in agricultural 
products. Agricultural subsidies have often stalled trade talks as these countries refused to 
further liberalize while developed countries continued to subsidize agriculture.  
 Export restraints 
 Over the vigorous objections of countries exporting natural resources, the GATT (and 
WTO) rounds have moved to tighten the conditions under which exports could be 
restrained. In general, world tariffs increase with the level of processing; for example, 

183
CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
import duties increase as copper is processed from concentrate to blister, to reﬁ ned copper, 
to copper wire and bars, to copper pots and pans. This tariff structure makes upgrading 
of natural resources in the producing country difﬁ cult. During the Tokyo Round, natural 
resource-producing countries were largely unsuccessful in their attempts to har monize 
tariffs on a sectoral basis in order to increase their ability to upgrade prior to export. 
However, they did argue successfully for their right to restrict exports to induce further 
domestic processing.  
 In addition to the above, other economic developments warrant consideration. These 
include countertrade, trade in services, and free trade zones. 
 Countertrade 
 Countertrade   is essentially barter trade in which the exporting ﬁ rm receives payment in 
terms of products from the importing country. Countertrade is important to the airline 
industry (for example, the purchase of Boeing 747s by British Airways if Boeing uses Rolls 
Royce engines) and in defense (for example, the purchase of US jet ﬁ ghters by Canada if 
some of the parts are locally sourced in Canada). Barter sometimes takes the form of a 
buyback in which the exporter agrees to take products that are locally produced. 
 Countertrade tends to decrease the efficiency of world trade because it substitutes barter 
for the exchange of goods by the price system. For example, a US exporter of machinery 
to Indonesia may have to take payment in an “equivalent value” of palm oil or rattan. The 
exporting firm will then either have to sell these products, in which it has no expertise 
itself, or sell them through a broker or other firm. Some party to the trade—exporter, 
importer, or consumer—must bear these additional costs. Despite such obvious inef-
ficiencies, countertrade appears likely to continue as an increasingly important factor in 
the international trade environment of the twenty-first century. 
 In one type of situation, however, countertrade may be beneficial. For example, if a US 
producer of textile machinery exports to China and agrees to take payment in the form of 
textile products, importers in the United States may perceive a lower risk of variability in 
product quality and delivery schedules (as a result of US technology and management), 
and the Chinese may perceive a lower risk of product failure in buying the machinery since 
the selling firm will not be “paid” unless the machinery performs to specifications.  
 Trade in services 
 International trade in services has received relatively little attention from governments 
or trade economists during trade negotiations. Reliable statistics are seldom collected. 
However, as high-income countries move toward a service economy, trade in services has 
grown and become a signiﬁ cant component of the current accounts of many countries. 
 In 2008, the United States exported goods worth $1.277 trillion and imported goods 
worth $2.117 trillion, which left a trade deficit of $840.251 billion on merchandise trade. In 
services it exported $550 billion and imported $405 billion for a trade surplus of $145 bil-
lion that partly offset its merchandise trade deficit. And, it had a surplus of $250 billion in 
the net income receipts from US FDI income (direct investment receipts/payments). Thus, 
the net deficit on these three accounts for the United States in 2008 was $706.068 billion. 
Details of the US goods, services, and FDI accounts appear in  Table   6.3   . (The balance of 
payments account will be explained in the Appendix of this chapter.)

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 The flow of services across/among countries is highly regulated. Internationally traded 
services such as banking, investment income, insurance, media, transportation, advertis-
ing, accounting, travel, and technology licensing are subject to a host of national and 
international regulations for economic, social, cultural, and political reasons. In 1995, 
the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) came into effect. It covers all ser-
vices except those provided by the government and those related to air traffic. Member 
countries are not forced to open all their service industries but can choose those areas for 
which they want to guarantee access to foreigners and, within a framework, how much 
access they want to provide. For example, a host nation might limit the scope of a foreign 
bank’s operation through the use of licenses or by setting a maximum number of allowable 
branches. As of January 2000, more than 140 WTO members started negotiating to further 
liberalize services. 
 Whatever forum is used, negotiating reductions in service trade barriers will be difficult, 
complex, and lengthy. The barriers are often difficult to list, much less quantify for pur-
poses of negotiation. And the issues are often highly charged and not subject to rational 
analysis. For example, Canada imposes Canadian content requirements on television, 
radio, and print media to foster a “national cultural identity,” to protect its cultural herit-
age, and to protect the domestic arts, theater, and movie industries. A government that 
reduced these trade barriers or even agreed to negotiate them would be in trouble with the 
(protected) Canadian media, as well as with the general public.   
 Free trade zones 
 A  free trade zone   is a designated area where importers can defer payment of customs duty 
while products are processed further (same as a foreign trade zone). Thus, the free trade 
zone serves as an “offshore assembly plant,” employing local workers and using local ﬁ nanc-
ing for a tax-exempt commercial activity. The economic activity takes place in a restricted

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
area such as an industrial park, because the land is often being supplied at a subsidized rate 
by a local host government that is interested in the zone’s potential employment beneﬁ ts.  
 To be effective, free trade zones must be strategically located either at or near an inter-
national port, on major shipping routes, or with easy access to a major airport. Important 
factors in the location include the availability of utilities, banking and telecom services, and 
a commercial infrastructure. 
 More than 400 free trade zones exist in the world today, often encompassing entire 
 cities, such as Hong Kong and Singapore. More than two-thirds are situated in developing 
countries, and most of their future growth is expected to occur there. 
 The advantages offered by free trade zones are numerous and mutually beneficial to all 
stakeholders. For private firms, the zones offer three major attractions. First, the firm pays 
the customs duty (tariff) only when the goods are ready to market. Second, manufacturing 
costs are lower because no taxes are levied. Third, while in the zone the manufacturer has 
the opportunity to repackage the goods, grade them, and check for spoilage. Secondary 
benefits to firms take the form of reduced insurance premiums (since these are based on 
duty-free values), reduced fines for improperly marked merchandise (since the good can 
be inspected in a zone prior to customers’ scrutiny), and added protection against theft 
(resulting from security measures in the bonded warehouses). 
 At the state and local levels, advantages can be realized in terms of commercial services. On 
a more global level, free trade zones enable domestic importing companies to compete more 
readily with foreign producers or subsidiaries of MNEs, thereby increasing participation in 
world trade. Favorable effects are felt on the balance of payments because more economic 
activity occurs and net capital outflow is reduced. Finally, the business climate is improved 
due to reduced bureaucracy and resultant savings to business capital, currently inaccessible 
because of the delay in paying duties and tariffs. A free trade zone is a step toward free trade 
and can be an important signal by government to business that the economy is opening up. 
Opportunity replaces regulation, and growth of economic activity should result. 
 Before the establishment of more free trade zones becomes fully accepted and encour-
aged, governments must be convinced of their many economic benefits. Free trade zones 
are a vital necessity if nations are to remain competitive on an international scale. Not only 
will existing companies benefit from their use, but new industries will be attracted, keeping 
up the same benefits of world trade. 
 The   maquiladora industry   along the US–Mexican border is an excellent example of a 
free trade zone. The low wage rate in Mexico and the NAFTA of 1994 make the  maqui-
ladora  region both accessible and important to labor-intensive firms in the United States 
and Canada. From only 12  maquiladora  plants in 1965, approximately 3,000 existed in 
2000. The  maquiladora industry has been so successful that only oil earns Mexico more 
foreign currency today. 
 No Mexican taxes are paid on goods processed within the  maquiladoras . Foreign com-
panies doing such processing can benefit from lower wages and land costs than those in the 
United States as they increase the value added to their products. In return, Mexico attracts 
FDI into permanent plants, creates jobs, and collects taxes on any final products sold to the 
foreign firms, or within Mexico. Even though the United States has several hundred free 
trade zones of its own, many near seaports or airfields, these lack the low-wage workers of 
their Mexican counterparts. 
 Canada does not have free trade zones, but the federal government allows duty draw-
backs, which arguably offer many of the same advantages. Unfortunately, these drawbacks, 
which are repayments of customs duties, apply retroactively and involve enough paperwork 
to discourage all but the largest or most dedicated organizations. As such, NAFTA and the 
lower-wage labor in Mexico have attracted Canadian firms producing labor-intensive 
products. Free trade zones exist in many other parts of the world than North America, and 
the advantages of these zones are enjoyed by businesses worldwide. 19

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 1   International economics is the branch of economics concerned with the purchase and 
sale of foreign goods and services. This includes consideration of areas such as inter-
national trade, balance of payments, and barriers to trade.  
 2   A number of international trade theories help to explain why nations trade. These 
include the theory of absolute advantage, the theory of comparative advantage, the fac-
tor endowment theory, the Leontief paradox, and the international product life cycle 
theory. While no one theory offers a complete explanation of why nations trade, they 
collectively provide important insights into the area. Other key considerations that offer 
explanations for why nations trade include monetary currency valuation and consumer 
tastes.  
 3   There are a number of barriers to trade. Some of the most common include price-based 
barriers, quantity limits, international price fixing, non-tariff barriers, financial limits, 
and foreign investment controls.  
 4   Although tariffs are often introduced to maintain local jobs and assist infant industries, 
they are inefficient. This economic inefficiency results in higher prices of imported 
goods for the consumers. The redistribution of resources from more efficient industry 
further adds to the cost of a tariff. Such costs do not occur under free trade.  
 5   Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) provide similar economic inefficiencies to tariffs. Unlike 
tariffs, however, NTBs are not imposed by nations to interfere deliberately with trade; 
they arise out of domestic policy. There are several types of NTBs, including quotas, 
“Buy national” restrictions, technical barriers, and export restraints.  
 6   Countertrade is a form of barter trade in which the exporting firm receives payments in 
terms of products produced in the importing country. It is most pronounced in East–
West trade, and although it may be beneficial to the trading partners, it increases the 
inefficiencies in the world trade system, which in turn raises costs and decreases trade 
volume. 
 7   Services are an important but somewhat misunderstood component of trade. Despite 
the trade of services in the billions of dollars among high-income countries, regulation 
has been outside the mandate of GATT. As services increase in importance, future dis-
cussion will take place concerning whether an international organization like GATT will 
carry the mandate to regulate this type of trade.  
 8   A free trade zone is a designated area where importers can defer payment of customs 
duty while further processing of products takes place. In essence, it is an offshore 
assembly plant. The majority of these areas exists in developing countries and handles 
approximately 20 percent of worldwide trade. Free trade zones are advantageous to all 
because they provide benefits such as increased employment and lower business costs.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 REAL CASE 
 Job losses and offshoring to China 
 It was not a difficult choice to make. Over the last 10 years, 
US imports of manufactured goods from China shot up. 
Cheap labor—Chinese labor is six times lower than Mexican 
labor—accounts for this. Continuing manufacturing oper-
ations in the United States and remaining price competitive 
is simply not feasible. When jobs are outsourced across 
national borders, e.g., from the United States to China, this 
is called offshoring. 
 Competition on quality, which can shelter domestic 
manufacturing from outsourcing to developing countries, 
was not an alternative because Chinese products for 
export are usually as good (although not in toys as Mattel 
found in 2007). When high labor intensity is tied to quality, 
the Chinese can outdo Western industrialized countries. 
Another factor is that the Chinese have a combination of 
highly skilled management and low-skilled labor, ensur-
ing that production is efficient and that quality standards 
are met. This ability to produce high-quality goods is also 
what allows China to move from export manufacturing 
of Christmas decorations, toys, footwear, and clothing to 
household, consumer appliances, and, increasingly, the IT 
manufacturing sector. 
 National Presto, a US firm that makes high-quality 
pressure cookers and electric frying pans, had a difficult 
decision to make in the early 2000s. It could either offshore 
its production to China or see its market share continue 
to deteriorate. In 2002, the company closed plants in 
Mississippi and New Mexico, reducing its US workforce to 
less than half, and expanded its production in China. By 
2003, all significant products marketed by the company 
were made in China. 
 Like many other US, European, and Japanese companies, 
National Presto uses an agent in Hong Kong to subcontract 
production to manufacturing plants in mainland China. 
Larger companies like Motorola, Philips, IBM, Toshiba, and 
GE have more control over their manufacturing plants in 
China. Kyocera of Japan, for example, invested $90 million 
in the early 2000s to construct a high-tech industrial park 
in Shilong Town of Dong guan City, Guangdong Province. 
Only 20 years ago Guangdong was dominated by paddy 
fields; today it is China’s largest manufacturing cluster. 
 Proponents of free trade argue that political rhetoric 
against trade with China is meant to appease US fears of 
job losses. Yet, as seen in  Table   1   , 0.4 percent of all job 
losses in the United States in the third quarter of 2010 
were the result of “out of country” relocation. While some

argue that this percentage is undervalued because it does 
not take into consideration potential job gains that never 
materialized, others argue that given economic conditions 
there was no assurance that firms that created new jobs in 
China would have chosen to create these jobs in the United 
States if offshoring to China had not been a possibility.  
 China has become the world’s largest manufacturer, 
ahead of the United States, Japan, and Germany. It has 
outpaced Japan to become the country having the largest 
trade surplus with the United States. US politicians and 
lobby groups blame Chinese protectionist practices for the 
growing trade deficit between the two nations, which in 
2003 was estimated at $124 billion. In 2009, the deficit with 
China totalled $226.83 billion, still the largest imbalance 
with any nation, but down 15.4 percent from the all time 
record of $268.04 billion set in 2008. The deficit with China 
is expected to resume rising in 2010 as the US economy 
recovers, triggering rising orders for Chinese manufac-
turers of shoes, toys and other low cost items in high 
demand by American consumers.  
 Among the barriers the United States claims prevent a 
free flow of its goods to China are import barriers, unclear 
legal provisions applied in a discriminatory manner against 
US imports, and an undervalued yuan. The last one has 
generated the most controversy in the last few years. 
The Chinese yuan has been fixed at 8.28 to the dollar 
since 1994, a rate that critics argue to be up to 40 percent 
undervalued. China relaxed the yuan’s fixed exchange

rate against the dollar in June 2010, but since then it was 
allowed to appreciate by less than 3%. Yet economists 
do not all agree that the yuan is undervalued. Some fear 
that a sharp deterioration would hurt not only the Chinese 
economy but also those trading partners that are most 
heavily dependent on Chinese imports.

 REAL CASE 
 Dumping on trade complaints 
 One of the biggest problems in international trade is the abil-
ity of domestic producers to lobby their home governments 
to erect barriers to trade. In the past, the textile, apparel, and 
shoe industries were able to obtain protection from cheaper 
imports through tariffs, quotas, and special measures. Now 
multilateral trade agreements under the GATT and WTO (and 
also regional and bilateral agreements such as NAFTA and 
the emerging Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum) 
outlaw such blatant instruments of protection. However, 
these agreements have been replaced by more subtle ones. 
 Prominent as a new type of protectionist device is the use 
of “unfair trade laws,” especially antidumping (AD) and coun-
tervailing duty (CVD) actions. The economic logic of AD and 
CVD makes some sense. It is unfair for a foreign producer to 
“dump” a product in your country below its price in the home 
country, or below the cost of producing it. Similarly, subsi-
dized foreign products should be offset by a CVD of equivalent 
effect. The problem, however, lies with the administration of 
the trade laws, which is subject to political lobbying. 
 A variety of studies have found that the bureaucrats who 
administer AD and CVD laws are subject to capture by the 
home industries, who then use AD and CVD cases as har-
assment tools against often economically efficient foreign 
rival producers. For example, Rugman and Anderson (1987) 
found that the US administration of AD and CVD was used 
in a biased manner against Canadian producers, especially 
in resource-based industries such as softwood lumber, 
fishing, and agriculture. Thus, in the Canadian–US Free 
Trade Agreement of 1989, and again in NAFTA, five-person 
binational panels of trade law experts were set up to review 
the decision of the US (and Canadian) trade law agencies. 
 In a subsequent study, Rugman and Anderson (1997) 
found that these binational panels were able to remand 
back (i.e. successfully challenge) the decision of the US 
agencies twice as often in cases involving Canada as in AD 
and CVD cases involving the rest of the world. In related 
work researchers have found that the EU is just as bad as 
the United States when it comes to taking questionable AD 
measures, especially against Asian countries. Indeed, one 
of the unresolved problems is how smaller countries can 
secure access to the protected markets of triad economies 
such as the United States and the EU. In Japan’s case, there 
are similar arguments (including those from its triad rivals) 
that it has entry barriers in place preventing market access.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 How well do we keep track of the millions of transactions that take place annually among 
exporters and importers, international banks, and multinational companies? The bankers 
who tabulate the foreign exchange dealings of their own banks are only a part of the picture. 
How well can we account for the part of direct investment that occurs through overseas 
borrowing, yet affects the home country’s international economic position? Even more sim-
ply, how well can we measure “international” transactions that are simply transfers of funds 
from the account of an importer to the account of a foreign exporter in the same bank? 
 The realistic answer to these questions is: not very well. National governments create 
elaborate accounts for the transactions between their residents and foreign residents, but 
it is often very difficult to obtain full and accurate information. Putting that problem aside 
for the moment, let us consider the methods that governments use to record each country’s 
international transactions. 
 The most widely used measure of international economic transactions for any country 
is the  balance of payments (BOP) . This record attempts to measure the full value of the 
transactions between residents of one country and residents of the rest of the world for some 
time period, typically one year. The balance of payments is a flow concept, in that it records 
flows of goods, services, and claims between countries over a period of time, rather than a 
stock of accumulated funds or products. It is a value concept, in that all the items recorded 
receive a monetary value, denominated in the given country’s currency at the time of those 
transactions.  The balance of payments thus is a record of the value of all the economic transactions 
between residents of one country and residents of all other countries during a given time period.  
 Why do we worry about measuring these transactions? We do so because if a country 
records a substantial imbalance between inflows and outflows of goods and services for 
an extended period of time, some means of financing or adjusting away the imbalance 
must be found. For example, if the Eurozone countries record a persistent trade deficit 
with China for several years, there will be pressure either to devalue the euro relative to 
the Chinese currency, the renminbi, or for Chinese investors to place large and continu-
ing investments into euro-denominated securities. This pressure presents both a political 
outcome (pressure on the Chinese government to revalue the renminbi) and an economic 
outcome (pressure on the euro to devalue and on European producers to lower their costs, 
perhaps by producing in China). 
 So, the importance of the balance of payments is not only macroeconomic, in the 
domain of government accountants, but also managerial, since an imbalance provides 
guidance to managers about expected government policies as well as about opportunities 
to take advantage of currency opportunities. Since the relatively open foreign exchange 
markets of many countries today leave the exchange rate substantially to supply and 
demand, the balance of payments is an indicator of exactly that supply and demand for a 
country’s currency that will lead to changes in the exchange rate. 
 The supply and demand for a currency come from both trade flows (exports and imports) 
and capital flows (investments and borrowing). So, the balance of payments implications for 
exchange rates must include both sides of the story, the “real” flows and the financial flows. 
  Balance of payments accounting 
 There is no such thing as the balance of payments, since the accounts are organized in a 
double-entry bookkeeping system, and for every debit entry there is a credit entry of equal 
value. There are half a dozen BOP measures, which group some international transactions 
together and leave others in a second, “everything else” category. In each case the intent is 
to place the fundamental economic causes of transactions in the ﬁ rst group and leave the

payments for them in the second group. In the actual accounts, the former transactions are 
listed “above the line,” and the payments are left “below the line.” 
 Current account 
 The  current account   consists of merchandise trade, services, and unilateral transfers. (See 
 Table   6A   , parts A and B.)  
 Merchandise trade is typically the first part of the current account. It receives more 
attention than any of the other accounts because this is where the imports and exports of 
goods are reported, and these are often the largest single component of all international 
transactions. In this account, sales of goods to foreigners (exports) are reported as credits 
because they are a source of funds or a claim against the purchasing country. Conversely, 
purchases of goods from overseas (imports) are recorded as debits because they use funds. 
This payment can be made by either reducing current claims on foreigners or increasing 
foreign liabilities.

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 Merchandise trade transactions can affect a country’s BOP in a number of ways. Assume 
that Nissan Motor of Japan has sold General Motors in the United States $600,000 worth of 
engines and these engines will be paid for from GM’s account in a Detroit bank. In this case 
the imports are a debit to the current account (A-1) and a credit to the “other short-term, 
private” capital account (C-6b). Here is how the entry would be recorded:  
 
 
 Debit 
 Credit 
 A-1 
 Merchandise imports 
 $600,000 
 
 C-6b

 Credit 
 B-1 
 Unilateral transfers, private 
 $10 million 
 
 A-1 
 Merchandise exports 
 
 $10 million 
 The result of this purchase is that the United States has transferred currency to 
 foreigners and thus reduced its ability to meet other claims.  
 Services 
 The services category includes many payments such as freight and insurance on inter-
national shipments (A-2); tourist travel (A-3); proﬁ ts and income from overseas investment 
(A-4); personal expenditures by government, civilians, and military personnel overseas 
(A-5); and payments for management fees, royalties, ﬁ lm rental, and construction services 
(A-6). Purchases of these services are recorded as debits, while sales of these services are 
similar to exports and are recorded as credits. For example, extending the earlier example 
of Nissan and GM, assume that the US auto maker must pay $125,000 to Nissan to ship the 
engines to the United States. The transaction would be recorded this way:  
 GM purchased a Japanese shipping service (a debit to the current account) and paid for 
this by increasing the domestic short-term assets held by foreigners (a credit to the capital 
account). 
 Unilateral transfers 
 Unilateral transfers are transactions that do not involve repayment or the performance of 
any service. Examples include the American Red Cross sending $10 million in food to refu-
gees in Somalia; the United States paying military pensions to residents of the Philippines 
who served in the US Army during World War II; and British workers in Kuwait shipping 
money home to their families in London. Here is how the American Red Cross transaction 
would appear in the US BOP:  
 Capital account 
 Capital account   items are transactions that involve claims in ownership. Direct investment 
(C-1) involves managerial participation in a foreign enterprise along with some account 
that involves degree of control. The United States classiﬁ es direct investments as those 
 Capital account 
  A category of the BOP that 
consists of transactions 
that involve financial claims    

196
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
investments that give the investor more than 10 percent ownership. Portfolio investment 
(C-2) is investment designed to obtain income or capital gains. For example, if Exxon 
shipped $20 million of equipment to an overseas subsidiary the entry would be:   
 
 
 Debit 
 Credit 
 C-1 
 Direct investment 
 $20 million 
 
 A-1 
 Exports 
 
 $20 million 
 “Other long-term” capital accounts are differentiated based on whether they are gov-
ernment (C-3) or private (C-4) transactions. These transactions have a maturity of over 
one year and involve either loans or securities. For example, Citibank may have loaned the 
government of Poland $50 million. “Other short-term” capital accounts are also differenti-
ated based on whether they are governmental (C-5) or private (C-6). Typical short-term 
government transactions are short-term loans in the securities of other governments. 
Private transactions often include trade bill acceptances or other short-term claims arising 
from the financing of trade and movements of money by investors to take advantage of 
interest differentials among countries.  
 Official reserves 
 Ofﬁ cial reserves are used for bringing BOP accounts into balance. There are four major 
types of reserves available to monetary authorities in meeting BOP deﬁ cits (D1 through 
D4 in  Table   6A   ). These reserves are analogous to the cash or near-cash assets of a private 
ﬁ rm. Given that billions of dollars in transactions are reported in BOP statements, it should 
come as no surprise that the amount of recorded debits is never equal to the amount of 
credits. This is why there is an entry in the reserve account for net errors and omissions. If a 
country’s reporting system is weak or there are a large number of clandestine transactions, 
this discrepancy can be quite large.  
 US BOP 
 The ofﬁ cial presentation of the US BOP is somewhat different from the IMF format pre-
sented in  Table   6A   . Because the United States plays such a dominant role in the world 
economy, it is important to examine the US system.  Table   6B    presents US international 
transactions for two recent years. 
 A number of select entries in  Table   6B    help to highlight the US BOP. Lines 2 and 19 
show that in 2008 exports of goods and services were $695.936 billion (line 73) less than 
imports. This trade deficit was smaller than 2006 when it stood at $763.267 billion, greater 
than that in 2002 when it stood at $421.7 billion, and 2003 when it was $496.5 billion, 
showing that the United States continues to have trade deficit problems. 
 To assess the trade situation accurately, however, we need to examine the data in more 
depth. This information is provided in  Table   6C   . The table shows that although US exports 
are strong in areas such as capital goods and industrial supplies and materials, the country 
also imports a large amount of these products. In addition, the United States is a net 
importer of foods, feeds, and beverages, automotive vehicles and parts, consumer goods, 
and petroleum and products. 
 In the early 1980s US trade deficits were offset by large amounts of income generated by 
direct investments abroad. Later in the decade massive international borrowing offset these 
deficits. More recently the situation has improved somewhat, and dollar devaluation has 
helped to generate stronger demand for US exports, thus partially reducing the growth rate

of its annual trade deficit. However, more concerted action will be needed if the United 
States is to continue on this course. One way is to continue to increase US competitiveness 
in the international market. Another way is to get other countries to reduce their trade 
barriers and to make international markets more open.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 When a country suffers a persistent balance of trade deficit, the nation will also suf-
fer from a depreciating currency and will find it difficult to borrow in the international 
capital market. In this case there are only two choices available. One is to borrow from the 
IMF and be willing to accept the restrictions that the IMF puts on the country, which are 
designed to introduce austerity and force the country back on to the right economic track. 
The other approach is for the country to change its fiscal policy (tariffs and taxes), resort 
to exchange and trade controls, or devalue its currency. To prevent having to undertake 
austerity steps, the United States will have to continue working very hard to control its 
trade deficit.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 This chapter considers financial markets that allow firms to find 
sources and uses of funds outside their home countries and to deal 
in currencies other than the domestic one. It also considers the risks 
involved in operating in these markets and the tools available to 
deal with those risks. The main risk has to do with dealing in foreign 
currencies, so   exchange risk   and the functioning of the   foreign 
exchange   market are key elements of the discussion. For example, 
when a German firm borrows from a bank in dollars, because of the 
low interest rate, the firm faces a problem of exchange risk. The firm 
has to decide what to do in case the dollar rises in value relative to 
the euro and makes loan repayment more expensive. 
   The main goals of the chapter are to: 
 1  Review  the basic characteristics of all the financial markets that 
may be available to a firm in international business.  
 2  Examine  the foreign exchange market, its operation, and the main 
participants.  
 3  Explain  the fundamental economic factors that determine the 
exchange rates in the absence of government intervention in the 
foreign exchange markets.  
 4  Show  how firms can operate successfully in more than one 
currency without facing unacceptable levels of exchange risk.  
 5  Give  insights into domestic money and capital markets that exist 
around the world.  
 6  Describe  the functioning of the euromarkets, both short term and 
long term.  
 7  Explain  how the international monetary system functions and how 
it relates to both private-sector firms and governments.  
 8  Look  at a country’s balance of payments and show what lessons 
can be drawn from it.  
 9  Show  how firms can take advantage of the opportunities available 
in all of these markets.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Barclays Bank, one of the largest banks in the world 
(measured by capital), had a worldwide spread of 
branches, representative offices, and other affiliates in 
the early 2000s. As at 2009, Barclays is the world’s ninth 
largest banking and financial services group and the UK’s 
second largest bank (Global Fortune 500, 2010 ranking). 
The bank was actively involved in businesses such as 
corporate finance for major firms around the world, retail 
banking in the UK and a few other countries in Europe, 
and in foreign exchange dealing in London, New York, 
Tokyo, and other financial capitals of the world. At the end 
of 2009 Barclays’ business was divided among the curren-
cies shown in  Table   1   . Growth in income and costs was 
constrained by foreign exchange translation movements. 
These are not necessarily major concerns for a multi-
national bank, since Barclays has lengthy experience in 
using these currencies, and the bank regularly deals with 
foreign exchange risk. Still, some banks had encountered 
huge crises due to foreign exchange losses. For example, 
National Australia Bank lost US $360 million in 2003–2004 
due to currency trading, and Allied Irish Banks lost more 
than US $770 million in 2002 from similar trading. Back in 
1974 the entire world financial system was shaken by a pair 
of foreign exchange losses that caused two banks to fail 
(Franklin National Bank in the United States and Bankhaus 
Herstatt in Germany) and the entire   eurocurrency system 
to briefly come to a halt. (In 2008 the British government 
nationalized Northern Rock to prevent its failure, while 
banks in the United States also faced failure due to losses 
on the subprime mortgage market leading to the world 
financial crisis)   
 Barclays is heavily involved in financial activities in more 
than 30 countries worldwide. This is an overstatement 
of the firm’s global activity. Instead, Barclays is a home 
region bank, with 60 percent of its revenues in Europe. A 
geographical analysis of revenues from external customers 
for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 
2009 shows that 44.06 percent of Barclays’ revenues are in 
the UK, the bank’s country of origin. Another 15.11 percent 
of the bank’s business is in other European Union coun-
tries, about 19.06 percent in the United States, 10.24 per-
cent in South Africa. This leaves 11.53 percent of Barclays’ 
business in the remaining countries where it operates. 
With this exposure to risks in other countries, as Table 1 
shows, Barclays has a large exposure in US dollars. 
 From another perspective, Barclays had an international 
financial exposure through its lending activities in various 
countries.  Table 2 shows this distribution of activity.

CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
  A key concern of Barclays is how to manage these 
overseas and foreign currency activities, especially with 
respect to the risk of currency losses. As an international 
bank, Barclays wants to operate in major financial centres, 
but as a prudently managed firm it doesn’t want to take 
undue risk in foreign currencies or put significant amounts 
of assets in high-risk environments.

 International ﬁ nancial markets are relevant to companies, whether or not they become 
directly involved in international business through exports, direct investment, and the like. 
Purchases of imported products or services may require payment in foreign exchange, thus 
involving exchange risk. A company may choose to invest in a foreign business or security, 
and face both different interest rates and different risks from those at home. Often com-
panies ﬁ nd that borrowing funds abroad is less expensive than borrowing domestically, in 
the United States or in any other home country. The relatively unrestricted “euromarkets” 
 generally offer better terms to borrowers ( and  lenders) than do domestic ﬁ nancial markets in 
any country. Likewise, in the 2000s, investors are discovering more and more opportunities 
to diversify their portfolios into holdings of foreign securities. This chapter explores the 
various foreign and international ﬁ nancial markets, including the foreign exchange market, 
and examines ways to utilize them for domestic and international business.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Currencies, like any other products, services, or claims, can be traded for one another. The 
foreign exchange market is simply a mechanism through which transactions can be made 
between one country’s currency and another’s. Or, more broadly, a foreign exchange market 
is a market for the exchange of ﬁ nancial instruments denominated in different currencies. 
The most common location for foreign exchange transactions is a commercial bank, which 
agrees to “make a market” for the purchase and sale of currencies other than the local one. 
In the United States, hundreds of banks offer foreign exchange markets in dozens of cities. 
However, over 40 percent of all foreign exchange business is done through the 10 largest 
banks in New York. 
 Foreign exchange is not simply currency printed by a foreign country’s central bank; 
rather, it includes such items as cash, checks (or drafts), wire transfers, telephone trans-
fers, and even contracts to sell or buy currency in the future. Foreign exchange is really 
any financial instrument that carries out payment from one currency to another. The 
most common form of foreign exchange in transactions between companies is the draft 
(denominated in a foreign currency). The most common form of foreign exchange in 
transactions between banks is the telephone or Internet transfer, generally for transactions 
of $1 million or more. Far down the list of instruments, in terms of the value exchanged, is 
actual currency, which is often exchanged by tourists and other travelers. 
 Since no currency is necessarily fixed in value relative to others, there must be some 
means of determining an acceptable price, or   exchange rate  . How many British pounds 
(£) should one dollar buy? How many Brazilian reals should be paid to buy a dollar? Since 
1973, most of the industrialized countries have allowed their currency values to fluctuate 
more or less freely (depending on the time and the country), so that simple economics of 
supply and demand largely determines exchange rates. In graphic form,  Figure   7.1    shows 
that the intersection of the supply curve and the demand curve for European euros (c) sets 
the price, or exchange rate, of euros in terms of dollars. Some of the participants in the 
foreign exchange market are listed below the graph; their specific activities are discussed 
in the following section.

CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
 The exchange rate of $1.2378 per euro is offered by one specific bank. This was the clos-
ing exchange rate quoted by Bankers Trust Company of New York for purchases of at least 
$1 million worth of euros on June 26, 2010. Another bank in New York may have quoted a 
slightly higher or slightly lower rate at the same time, and banks in San Francisco, London, 
or Tokyo probably quoted rates that differed even more. The rates quoted depend on each 
bank’s interest in being involved in foreign exchange transactions and on the varying strategic 
positions and risks taken by the banks. Thus, the foreign exchange market among banks may 
be viewed as one large market or as many small markets with extensive (potential and actual) 
interrelations. Generally, the interbank market within any country is viewed as one market, 
and intercountry dealings are somewhat segmented by different rules and risks (though in the 
United States, the San Francisco market often offers quotations from various banks that dif-
fer noticeably from rate quotations in New York, due partly to the difference in time zones). 
 The differences in rate quotations may appear very small to an outsider. For example, 
Euros may be quoted at $1.23236 at Citibank in New York and at $1.23386 at Bank of 
America in San Francisco. This difference seems small, but for every 1 million euros sold, 
the buyer of dollars in San Francisco receives an extra $1,500. Since the transactions are 
generally rapid, for values of $5 million to $10 million such differences may add up to a 
substantial gain (or cost) to the participant in the foreign exchange market.       1 
 The various foreign exchange transactions just mentioned involve large commercial banks 
and large amounts of money. Most of the companies that do international business also utilize 
foreign exchange markets, but far less frequently than banks and for transactions that involve 
less money. Consequently, these companies’ access to foreign currencies differs from that of 
the banks. (Specifically, banks make the market and companies pay for the use of this service.) 
The next section describes the various participants in the US foreign exchange market.

 Figure  7.2 presents an overview of the foreign exchange markets operating today in the 
United States. This section discusses each of these markets in some detail.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 The interbank market 
 Although the foreign exchange dealings of most managers involve a company buying from, 
or selling to, a bank, managers must understand the foreign exchange market among banks. 
This is because, as noted above, the vast majority of large-scale foreign exchange transac-
tions are interbank, and these transactions tend to determine exchange rates, with which 
occasional market participants such as companies must deal. 
 Local and regional commercial banks may offer clients a foreign exchange service, 
which such banks provide on request by dealing through a larger bank, typically in a large 
city (such as New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago). If a local bank receives a request to buy 
Swiss francs (SF) for an importer in New Jersey, it will call its correspondent bank in New 
York (say, JP Morgan-Chase Bank) and arrange to buy the SF for, say, $0.6753/SF. Then 
the local bank will add on its service charge so that the importer pays $0.6853/SF. Thus, the 
local bank earns $0.01 per SF, or about 1.5 percent on the transaction. 
 JP Morgan-Chase Bank, in turn, will either take the requested Swiss francs from its own 
holdings of that currency or enter the interbank market to buy them. Assuming that Chase 
does  not  have the SF on hand, one of its   foreign exchange traders   will call several other 
major banks (or brokerage houses, which are discussed below) and contract to buy Swiss 
francs from the lowest bidder.   
 The interbank market generally operates with large transactions only of about $1 mil-
lion to $10 million exchanged for the equivalent foreign currency. On a typical day in 
2010, the more than 45 members of the main association of commercial banks in foreign 
exchange dealings (called the Clearinghouse Interbank Payments System, or CHIPS) trans-
acted roughly $2 trillion in currency trades. 2

 Another facet of large-scale foreign exchange dealing in the United States is the brokers’ mar-
ket. About six   foreign exchange brokers   make markets for foreign currencies in New York 
(as well as in London and elsewhere), creating trading in many currencies similar to that in 
the interbank market. In this case, the key differences are that the brokers seek to match buyers 
and sellers on any given transaction, without taking a position       3  themselves; they deal simul-
taneously with many banks (and other companies); and they offer both buy and sell positions 
to clients (where a bank may wish to operate on only one side of the market at any particu-
lar time). Also, the brokers deal “blind,” offering rate quotations without naming the poten-
tial seller/buyer until a deal has been negotiated. Brokers play a large role in the total market, 
arranging about half of total interbank foreign exchange transaction in the early 2000s.    
 Before moving on to other foreign exchange markets, let us consider an example in which 
the spot market is used by a tourist planning a trip to Japan. This person wants to visit Tokyo 
to see a friend during the Christmas vacation and to do some sightseeing. She is taking 
$1,000 with her and has already purchased the round-trip airline ticket. Since dollars cannot 
be used for most purchases in Japan, she needs to buy Japanese yen. How should she do it? 
 Looking at the currency trading listing in  Table   7.1   , she sees that Bankers Trust is offer-
ing to sell large quantities of yen at the rate of 112 yen per dollar. At the “retail” level—that 
is, for small transactions such as this one—she can expect to receive fewer yen per dollar. 
Instead of carrying the cash with her, she wants to get traveler’s checks. Upon calling the 
office of American Express in San Francisco, she found that yen-denominated traveler’s 
checks were available but would cost her the exchange rate, plus a $5 service charge. 
 The tourist was willing to pay the extra cost to obtain the protection of traveler’s checks, 
but one final problem arose. A friend who works in foreign exchange dealing at Wells 
Fargo Bank told her that the yen would probably decline in value relative to the dollar in 
the next few days. Since she would not leave for Tokyo for another week, she wondered 
whether it was worth waiting for the expected devaluation. The answer to this question 
is that no one knows! She can hope for a devaluation and delay purchase of the yen for

a week, or ignore the potential gain or loss and buy the yen today. In such a short time 
period, it is probably better to ignore the few days’ variability in the exchange rate—since 
it could be favorable or unfavorable—and just buy the yen at the most convenient time 
before departing for Tokyo. (One more point to confuse the matter: she could buy 
traveler’s checks in US dollars and exchange them for yen in Japan when needed. Again, 
no one can be sure what the yen’s value will be during her vacation time in Tokyo.) 
 Although this example does not offer a guaranteed way to make money from foreign 
exchange dealings, it does illustrate the kinds of problems that beset individuals and com-
panies as they work with foreign currencies. Fortunately, there are some methods to help 
avoid the uncertainty involved in foreign exchange; they are discussed in the section below 
on “Protecting against exchange risk.” 
 So far, our discussion has focused only on the  spot market ; that is, the market for 
immediate exchange of one currency for another. An additional, very large part of the US 
foreign exchange market is the set of instruments that allow contracting today for delivery 
of currency in the future. The main instruments of this type are forward contracts, foreign 
exchange futures contracts, and foreign currency options.  
  The forward foreign exchange market 
 The forward foreign exchange market at commercial banks in the United States offers 
banks, companies, and individuals the opportunity to contract  today  for a speciﬁ c foreign 
exchange transaction in the  future , at a ﬁ xed price (that is, exchange rate). Forward con-
tracts are negotiated between the offering bank and the client as to size, maturity, and price. 
Referring to  Table   7.1   , we see that Bankers Trust was offering to sell British pounds for 
$1.5500/£ in 360 days on June 26, 2010 (for quantities of at least $1 million). 
 The rationale for forward contracts in currencies is analogous to that for futures contracts 
in commodities: the firm can lock in a price today to eliminate uncertainty about the value of 
a future receipt or a payment of foreign currency. A firm may undertake such a transaction 
because it has made a previous contract, for example, to pay €1 million to a supplier in three 
months for some needed inputs to its operations. If the firm wants to eliminate the risk that 
its payment in three months will change in dollar terms (that is, the c1 million may cost more 
dollars then), it can contract with a bank to buy €1 million three months forward, at a price 
established today. (From  Table   7.1   , we see that the price was $1.2500/EUR for a contract with 
Bankers Trust on June 26, 2010.) Thus, firms can use forward contracts to eliminate the risk 
of variability in future dollar costs or revenues due to exchange rate changes. This concept, 
called  hedging , and other motives for using the forward market are discussed later. 
 Notice that in the above example, the forward contract used for hedging is not the same 
thing as an insurance contract. The forward contract does fix a minimum “loss” for the 
firm by setting the guaranteed price of exchange in the future. Even if the dollar devalues 
to $1.30 per € in three months, the forward contract holder is still able to buy €1 million 
for $1.3710/€. However, if the euro devalues over the next three months to, say, $1.2400/€, 
the forward contract holder will have an opportunity cost of the difference between the

forward rate and the (eventual) future spot rate. Thus, the forward contract insures against 
potential losses  and against potential gains in foreign currency value. 
 Forward markets exist in any currencies and for any maturities that banks are willing to 
offer. Most of the forward contracts used in the United States involve exchanges of US dol-
lars for euros, Japanese yen, British pounds, Swiss francs, and Canadian dollars. Maturities 
tend to be six months or less, though single-year and multiyear forward contracts are 
sometimes available. 
  The futures market in currencies 
 A very similar type of instrument is available on several securities exchanges in the United 
States and abroad. The foreign exchange futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a 
ﬁ xed amount of foreign currency for delivery at a ﬁ xed future date at a ﬁ xed dollar price. 
The main difference between futures and forward contracts in the United States is that 
futures contracts have ﬁ xed sizes (about $50,000 to $100,000, depending on the currency) 
and pre-established maturity dates. (All are 3-, 6-, 9-, or 12-month contracts maturing on 
the third Wednesday of March, June, September, or December.) Also, futures contracts are 
available for only a few currencies (Canadian dollars, euros, Swiss francs, British pounds, 
Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Australian dollars, and a few others), and only if a buyer and 
a seller can be found at the time. 
 The futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is currently very thin (that is, 
few contracts are traded) except for the three-month contracts denominated in Canadian 
dollars, euros, Swiss francs, British pounds, and Japanese yen. 
 Futures contracts are more widely accessible to firms and individuals than forward con-
tracts because of their smaller value and the margin requirements that enable brokers to 
obtain collateral from market participants. (However, the currently thin nature of this mar-
ket does not allow participants the wide range of currencies and maturities that are available 
for large-scale transactions in the forward market.) The standard contracts available at the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are described in  Table   7.2   . Trading hours have been 
extended via the GLOBEX system, which permits worldwide access to CME contracts. In 
2010, GLOBEX trading was available for about 19 hours per day around the world.   
 Foreign currency  options  are an additional instrument of the foreign exchange market 
in the United States; they offer participants the  right  to buy or sell foreign currency in the 
future rather than the obligation to do so. Foreign currency options are similar to foreign

currency futures in the Unites States in that the contracts are for fixed quantities of cur-
rency to be exchanged at a fixed price in the future. The key difference is that the option 
may be exercised, that is, presented for currency exchange, at any time between its issuance 
and the maturity date, or not at all.4
Foreign exchange arbitrage involves simultaneous contracting in two or more foreign 
exchange markets to buy and sell foreign currency, profiting from exchange rate differ-
ences without incurring exchange rate risk. Foreign exchange arbitrage may be two-way, 
three-way, or intertemporal and is generally undertaken by large commercial banks that 
can exchange large quantities of money to exploit small rate differentials.
The simplest form of exchange arbitrage is two-way arbitrage, between any two cur-
rencies and between two places. Assume quotations for Swiss francs in the spot market on 
June 26, 2010, were:
At Bankers Trust in New York:	
$0.91038/SF
At Bank of America in San Francisco:    $0.91158/SF
At Lloyds Bank in London:	
$0.91398/SF
An arbitrageur can buy SF in New York and simultaneously sell them in London, making 
a profit of $0.0036/SF, or 0.37 percent per transaction. While the percentage gain is small, 
it translates to $3,600 for every SF 1 million traded, and it involves no exchange risk. By 
repeatedly arbitraging this price (exchange rate) differential, the arbitrageur will make a 
profit until the exchange rate differential drops below the transactions cost (that is, the 
­telephone bill, plus the arbitrageur’s salary, plus other relevant costs). 
The same two-way arbitrage may also occur in the forward market or between forward 
and futures markets. From the quotations here, we see that profitable arbitrage opportun­
ities exist between the New York forward market and the Chicago futures market, as well 
as between the New York and San Francisco forward markets:
At Bankers Trust in New York: ¥109.00/$ for delivery in 90 days.
At Bank of America in San Francisco: ¥109.90/$ for delivery in 90 days.
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange: ¥107.38/$ for delivery on June 26, 2010.
An arbitrageur can buy yen in New York and sell them in San Francisco, both for exchange 
in 90 days, and earn ¥0.9/$, or 0.77 percent per transaction. Similarly, an arbitrageur can 
buy yen in Chicago and sell them in San Francisco, to make ¥1.62/$, or 1.4 percent per 
transaction. The difficulties with the latter transaction are that contracts may not be avail-
able for the desired amount or maturity date and transaction costs are higher for the inter-
market exchanges. Nonetheless, both transactions may be feasible and profitable, even after 
costs are considered.5

What exchange risk does Barclays have as at December 31, 2009?
Barclays has exchange risk on the various assets and liabilities that were on its books at 
year-end 2009. These include exposures of £6,056 million in US dollars and £2,902 million 
in Euros, among others. From the second table in the case, it appears that these expo-
sures may be from lending to corporations in the European Union and the United States 
(though this is not certain, since some other activities are missing from the table). These 
are net asset exposures, or long positions, since Barclays will receive future cash flows in 
these currencies, and their values may change in terms of British pounds.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Exchange rates are determined by the activities of the various actors described earlier. If one 
could calculate the supply and demand curves for each exchange market participant and 
anticipate government constraints on the exchange market, exchange rate determination 
would be fairly simple. The composite supply and demand for foreign exchange would be 
as depicted in  Figure  7.1 . 
 Lacking this information, the analyst can still rely on two fundamental economic 
relation ships that underlie exchange rate determination. Note that this section considers 
only economic factors; government restrictions on the exchange market are ignored. 
 The two fundamental economic relationships are   purchasing power parity and the 
 international Fisher effect  . The former posits that shifts in exchange rates will occur to 
offset different rates of inflation in pairs of countries, and the latter proposes that exchange 
rates will shift to offset interest rate differentials between countries.    
 Purchasing power parity 6 
 The purchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the law of one price and explains the 
long-run exchange rates. If two countries produce an identical product and transportation 
costs are extremely low, the price of the product should be the same in two countries. Under 
the law of one price, the price of the product is the same not only in two countries but also 
around the world. If a standard ton of polyurethane plastic costs $200 in the United States 
and €190 in Germany, PPP requires an exchange rate of $1.05/€. The same reasoning could 
be used for all products whose production processes are equivalent in two countries and 
that are traded between these countries. The exchange rate that comes closest to simul-
taneously satisfying all of these equilibrium conditions is the PPP rate—a rate that equates 
the internal purchasing power of the two currencies in both countries. 
 Assuming we begin from that exchange rate, what will happen if Germany’ inflation is 
5 percent and the US inflation is 10 percent in the following year? PPP requires that the 
exchange rate adjust to eliminate this differential. Specifically, it requires that: 
 1  InflUS 
_ 
1  InflGer
    XRt1 
_ 
XRt
  
 where: 
 Infl  inflation rate 
 t  time period 
 This means that inﬂ ation in the United States relative to inﬂ ation in Germany should be 
the same as the future exchange rate compared to the spot exchange rate. The relationship 
can also be written in a form similar to the interest parity equation by rearranging terms:

 Nominal interest rate 
  The actual rate of interest 
offered by a bank, typically 
given as an annual 
percentage rate 
is, “real”) interest rates tend to stay the same over time; as inﬂ ation rises or falls, so do 
 nominal (unadjusted)  interest rates , such that   real interest rates remain unchanged. 
At the transnational level, nominal national interest rates are expected to differ only 
by the expected change in the national currency’s price (that is, the exchange rate). The 
international Fisher effect thus concludes that interest differentials between national 
markets will be eliminated by adjustments in the exchange rate. In terms similar to PPP, 
we see that:

 Notice that the international Fisher effect  will operate in a free market, because investors 
will receive a higher return in euros otherwise. As more and more investors put their money 
in euros, the spot price of the euro will rise. Similarly, as US investors return their euro 
earnings to dollars at the end of the period (year), this increased demand for dollars will 
cause the euro to devalue (in the future). Thus, dollar and euro earnings will tend to be 
equalized.  
 Combined equilibrium relationships 
 The future exchange rate, XRt1, will be partially determined by both of the above fac-
tors (PPP and IFE), which can be viewed in a general equilibrium context as shown in 
 Figure  7.3 . This ﬁ gure also demonstrates the interest parity relationship, which provides 
another link between current and future currency values. Remember that these relation-
ships are  equilibrium  economic conditions, which hold only approximately since sub-
stantial uncertainty exists about future conditions. Also, if a government intervenes to 
prohibit the market from determining exchange rates, the relationships may diverge sub-
stantially from the equilibrium conditions.  Figure   7.3    shows the main economic inﬂ u-
ences that, along with government policies and other factors, combine to determine 
exchange rates. Note that the expected exchange rate is in the top box, and the determi-
nants of that rate (interest difference and inﬂ ation difference) are presented as fractions, 
so that they show the precise relationship between the spot exchange rate, XRT, and the 
expected future rate, E[XRT].  
 A final caveat is in order. Despite the strong relationships among interest differentials, 
inflation differentials, and exchange rates, other important  economic  influences operate 
in international finance. Pure speculation can cause shifts in exchange rates, despite the 
fundamental economic conditions that have been described above. A country’ balance of 
payments position may affect the exchange rate, even though that position also affects 
interest and inflation rates as well. Since the abandonment of the Bretton Woods system of 
fixed exchange rates, exchange rate determination has been extremely uncertain—perhaps 
similar to the determination of future values of stock exchange indexes.  

210
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
  Other factors determining exchange rates 
 PPP and IFEs explain overall exchange rate well, but other factors also determine exchange 
rates. In general factors affecting the demand and supply of domestic products over 
 foreign products determine exchange rates because these factors affect the demand and 
supply of local and foreign currencies in exchange rate markets. First, changes in demand 
affect the exchange rate. For example, the changes in trade barriers, such as tariffs and 
quotas, can affect the exchange rate. If the United States raises the tariff rates over Chinese 
products due to antidumping or countervailing regulation, the demand for domestic 
products will be increased over Chinese products and the US dollar tends to appreciate. 
Second, the changes in supply will affect the exchange rate. For example, China becomes 
more productive than before. Chinese auto manufacturers recently developed their own 
models and produced them with great productivity, and the Chinese auto manufacturers 
can lower the price over foreign auto manufacturers. This affects the demand for Chinese 
automobiles, and the Chinese currency tends to appreciate. Third, national govern-
ments reserve foreign currencies and actively control foreign exchange rates to lower the 
price of exporting goods, to stabilize exchange rate volatility, and to protect the national 
economy from a currency crisis. According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and 
International Monetary Fund, China and Japan are the No.1 and No.2 country in terms of 
reserves of foreign exchange and gold. China’s reserves for foreign exchanges and gold are 
$2.426 trillion (31 December 2009 est.) $1.953 trillion (31 December 2008 est.). Japan’s 
reserves of foreign exchange and gold amounts of $1.024 trillion (31 December 2009 est.) 
and $1.011 trillion (31 December 2008 est.).

What should Barclays’ expectation be about the value of the pound relative to 
the euro or the dollar? 
 Barclays can forecast the value of the euro or the dollar based on PPP, the IFE, or a 
chartist method, in addition to simply using the forward exchange rate. Since Barclays’ 
business includes currency trading, the bank probably should use one or more methods 
for the minute-by-minute activity in the foreign exchange market, and another method or 
methods for its longer-term concerns such as future maturities of loans and accounting 
reporting periods. In sum, Barclays should forecast using market-based tools such as IFE 
and PPP, as well as using additional methods such as technical forecasting or leading 
indicators for short periods of time such as hours or a few days.   
 Exchange risk is a very real concern for ﬁ nancial managers, whether or not their ﬁ rms are 
directly involved in international business. The fact that the prices of imported products 
and services often vary with the exchange rate means that a local ﬁ rm’s costs may depend on 
the exchange rate. Similarly, if any of the ﬁ rm’s sales are exported, its earnings may vary as 
foreign sales change due to exchange rate changes. Even a purely domestic ﬁ rm faces these 
problems, since suppliers and competitors that  are  doing international business will adjust 
to exchange rate changes, and this will affect the domestic ﬁ rm. 
 From this perspective, exchange risk is  not  the risk that a local currency will decrease 
in value (devalue) relative to the home currency.  Exchange risk is the possibility that a firm 
will be unable to adjust its prices and costs to exactly offset exchange rate changes.  Thus, a US 
importer which faces 10 percent higher costs because of a dollar devaluation from €0.80/$ 
to €0.72/$ still has no exchange risk as long as the importer can raise its own prices by 
10 percent without lowering total sales. (This result is the microeconomic version of PPP.) 
The problem may be viewed as one of “passing through” cost increases to the firm’ cus-
tomers via higher sales prices. 
 Similarly, the appropriate measure of exchange risk for financial instruments is the 
firm’s possible loss or gain in purchasing power from exchange rate-adjusted interest rates. 
Investing in a US dollar account that pays 5 percent per year is better than investing in a Swiss 
franc account that pays 10 percent per year if, during the year, the franc devalues by 6 percent.  
  Alternatives to minimize exchange risk 
 Exchange risk exists whenever the ﬁ rm’s prices and costs cannot be exactly adjusted to 
 offset changes in the exchange rate. Let us now consider a group of alternatives that will 
allow a ﬁ rm to minimize (or at least reduce) its exchange risk. These alternatives fall into 
four categories: 
 1  Risk avoidance 
 2  Risk adaptation 
 3  Risk transfer 
 4  Diversification 
 PROTECTING AGAINST EXCHANGE RISK 

212
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 Risk avoidance 
 Exchange risk avoidance   is the strategy of trying to avoid foreign currency transactions. 
A purely domestic ﬁ rm can try to make all of its purchases from local suppliers of locally 
produced goods and make all of its sales to local buyers in competition only with other 
domestic ﬁ rms. Obviously, this strategy is impractical, if only because all ﬁ rms are affected 
by goods priced in foreign currency—automobiles, chemicals, steel, and so on. Also, there 
are very few industries that do not use imported materials, export some of their output, or 
compete with imported products.   
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Wall Street and world financial markets 
 International finance affects virtually every business. 
Companies with overseas operations, for example, are 
continually concerned with the rise and fall of the cur-
rencies in the countries where they operate. Indonesia is 
a good example as seen by the country’s currency crisis 
of the late 1990s that sent shock waves through the Asian 
business market. As a result, thousands of firms went 
bankrupt, the country’s currency lost 80 percent of its 
value, and the stock market plummeted by 60 percent. In 
the aftermath, Indonesia was hit with soaring unemploy-
ment and inflation led to riots that forced the resignation 
of the government. (See the Real Case “ World Financial 
Crises ” at the end of this chapter.) 
 Yet the international financial markets have never suf-
fered anything like the initial effect from the terrorist 
attacks on the twin towers of New York City’s World Trade 
Center (WTC) on September 11, 2001. In addition to totally 
demolishing the two buildings as well as several large 
surrounding structures, the terrorists killed nearly 3,000 
people, many of them Wall Street employees, and rocked 
the major international financial markets from London to 
Tokyo. One of the hardest-hit groups was the insurers who 
had losses of more than $15 billion. In addition, while the 
important financial records of businesses in the WTC were 
located in safe havens such as central computer banks 
miles away from Ground Zero, the effect of the terrorist 
actions began to quickly surface. 
 This was reflected on Wall Street where the stock 
market began a sharp downturn. Within two weeks of the 
terrorist act, the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE’s) 
Dow Index had lost 14 percent of its value. Only during the 
Great Depression had the United States seen a downturn 
this sharp. And for the rest of the world, the financial 
shock was shared very quickly. The NYSE and other major 
international stock exchanges saw massive sell-offs as 
investors headed for the sidelines, and companies seeking 
to raise capital in the international market put their plans 
on hold. Simply put, as the US economy began to slow down 
and focus its investment efforts on rebuilding and regen-
erating its own hard-hit industries, there were going to 
be less funds available for other things. The international 
finance lesson is clear: today’s money markets are linked 
very, very closely. And a catastrophe in one geographic 
area can have major implications in all of the others. New 
York City remains a financial hub of the business world, 
and the effects of the September 2001 crisis have passed. 
Yet the financial risks that international business firms 
must assume will not diminish because of the large inter-
dependency that now exists between the major centers of 
worldwide commerce. 
 In 2007–2008 another international financial crisis 
occurred and until 2010, the world economy has not yet 
recovered. Following defaults by borrowers in the US 
subprime mortgage markets many banks found that their 
balance sheets were in a mess as their housing assets 
had been overvalued. Not only US banks suffered—in early 
2008 the British bank, Northern Rock, was nationalized by 
Prime Minister Brown’s government in order to stop its 
default. The US financial crisis became a worldwide prob-
lem for all financial institutions due to the close intercon-
nections in the international money markets. International 
capital markets are highly integrated (indeed globalized), 
unlike goods markets (which are regional) and factor mar-
kets (where labor is localized).

CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
 Risk adaptation 
 Exchange risk adaptation   offers a more realistic alternative for protecting the ﬁ rm 
against exchange risk. This strategy includes all methods of “hedging” against exchange 
rate changes. In the extreme, exchange risk calls for protecting all liabilities denominated 
in foreign currency with equal-value, equal-maturity assets denominated in that foreign 
 currency. An illustration can best clarify this point. 
 Assume a French firm has contracted to buy $100,000 of machinery from a foreign sup-
plier for use in its manufacturing operations. The purchase is payable in six months in US 
dollars. To eliminate foreign exchange risk completely, the firm may do two things. First, it 
may raise its own prices to customers once the six months pass to equate euro devaluation 
to price increase. (Note that this does  not  involve a foreign currency hedge.) If this option 
is not available, which is often the case, the firm may look to its other option: obtain some 
equal-value  dollar asset  maturing in 180 days. This may be as simple as depositing funds in 
a dollar-denominated bank account for six months or as arcane as arranging a swap of the 
dollar liability for some other firm’s euro liability. Fairly standard methods of hedging an 
exposed dollar liability include: 
 1   Obtaining a dollar-denominated financial asset (for example, a time deposit or a 
Certificate of Deposit (CD)) that matures when the liability comes due.  
 2   Finding a buyer for your firm’s products and agreeing to receive payment in US dollars 
for the same value and time as the liability.  
 3   Finding a bank that will contract to buy euros from you and sell you dollars at a price 
fixed today for exchange when the liability comes due. (This is called a  forward contract .) 
 4   Agreeing with another (for example, North American) firm to exchange your dollar 
liability for that firm’s (that is, its French subsidiary’s) euro liability.  
 5   Contracting for any other equal-value, equal-maturity dollar-denominated asset that 
will offset the exposed liability.   
 The firm’s goal in choosing among these methods is to minimize the cost of protection 
against exchange rate risk. 
 Risk transfer 
 The third strategy for reducing exchange risk is   exchange risk transfer . This strategy 
involves the use of an insurance contract or guarantee that transfers the exchange risk to the 
insurer or guarantor. In many countries, the central bank offers exchange risk guarantees to 
importers and exporters of some products according to the bank’s policies. Technically, though 
perhaps not realistically, any ﬁ rm or government agency could issue a guarantee covering 
exchange rate changes to a local importer, at a price that would presumably reﬂ ect the risk.   
 Diversification 
 The ﬁ nal strategy for reducing exchange risk is   currency diversification  . Here a ﬁ rm 
can reduce the risk of unexpected local currency devaluations by spreading its assets 
and  liabilities across several currencies (for example, euros, Swiss francs, and pounds in 
ad dition to US dollars). This strategy simply means, “Don’t put all of your eggs in one 
 basket.” Domestically, a ﬁ rm should deal with several suppliers and a variety of customers 
to reduce risk through diversiﬁ cation. Internationally, a ﬁ rm should hold assets (and 
liabilities) in several currencies to reduce the impact of unexpected exchange rate changes.  
 The strategy that is probably most useful to the majority of firms is risk adaptation, 
or hedging. A key point of this section is to recognize that other alternatives may be used 
in many instances when hedging would be more expensive or otherwise less desirable. 
Nonetheless, the central problem in exchange risk management is hedging, and corporate 
treasurers should always be on the lookout for new instruments and techniques.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 In each country an MNE enters, it will be able to obtain some degree of access to local 
ﬁ nancial markets. The MNE will generally utilize such markets to perform necessary local 
ﬁ nancial transactions and often to hedge its local asset exposure through local borrowing 
(or its local liability exposure through local deposits or investments). But the MNE can also 
utilize local ﬁ nancial markets to obtain additional funding (or place additional funds) for 
its non-local activities. A Mexican ﬁ rm, for example, may choose to borrow funds through 
its Houston afﬁ liate to ﬁ nance its local needs in Texas  and ﬁ nance some of its needs in 
Mexico. 
 Usually national financial markets are not fully accessible to foreign firms; they are 
largely reserved for domestic borrowers and lenders. In these cases, use of local financial 
markets must be supplemented by use of the financial markets in the country of the parent 
company or elsewhere. Typically, such problems arise in countries that impose exchange 
controls, which limit the MNE’s ability to put needed funds in the affiliate. 
  MNEs and national money markets 
 The advantages MNEs obtain from entering national money markets as  borrowers  of funds 
stem from the portfolio effect of holding liabilities in more than one (ﬂ uctuating) currency 
and from the local risk hedging that occurs as the MNE moves to balance local assets such 
as plant and equipment with local liabilities, such as local-currency borrowing. Additional 
beneﬁ ts may occur if the local government subsidizes such loans through interest rate 
reduction, through tax breaks, or otherwise; a policy of this kind may be offered to attract 
the MNE’s investment. This may lower the whole MNE’s cost of capital if the subsidy does 
not disappear and if the interest rate remains below the comparable home-currency rate 
during the borrowing period. 
 The advantages MNEs obtain from entering national money markets as  lenders of 
funds stem from the portfolio effect of holding financial instruments in more than one 
currency. There may also be a gain from balancing local-currency assets and liabilities if 
an excess of local liabilities was held previously. In addition, local financial investments 
may be a necessary strategy when exchange controls or profit remittance limits exist; such 
investments offer the firm an outlet for retained earnings that yield interest. Sometimes

How should Barclays deal with the risk involved in its foreign currency 
positions? 
 As an international bank, Barclays is constantly becoming involved in foreign exchange 
transactions. The bank needs to have a policy for its traders and its other bankers as 
to how much exchange risk the bank is willing to tolerate before looking for protection. 
The bank presumably knows more than most people about what to expect in the foreign 
exchange market, and it is very likely that Barclays will choose to run exchange risk 
without hedging because of this knowledge. Still, the bank must limit its exposure, and 
the usual hedging techniques for banks are forward contracts and matching loans with 
deposits in the same currency.

an exchange control policy may make the local-currency interest rates higher than those 
available in other currencies (after adjusting for expected exchange rate changes). In these 
cases, higher-than-normal profits can be earned by investing funds in local instruments, 
although exchange controls may limit conversion of the profits into the home-country 
currency, or a government-imposed exchange rate change may wipe out the advantage.  
  MNEs and national capital markets 
 The advantages MNEs obtain from entering national capital markets as  borrowers  are similar 
to those obtained from entering national money markets. However, the opportunities are 
generally much more limited. Very few countries have substantially developed stock markets, 
and those that do usually restrict the issuance of shares by foreigners. A few exceptions exist, 
such as the United States, the UK, Germany, and France, but even they serve only the largest 
and most creditworthy MNEs. National bond markets, when they exist, are also very restric-
tive. Thus far, virtually all of the   foreign bond   issues have taken place in New York (called 
“Yankee bonds”), London, Switzerland, Germany, and Japan (called “Samurai bonds”).  
 The  eurobond   market, which functions mostly outside the United States, is dominated 
by dollar issues, which constitute about 40 percent of that total. In all, dollar-denominated 
issues account for about 36 percent of the two types of international bonds.  
 The advantages MNEs obtain from entering national capital markets as  lenders come 
mainly from diversification and from higher returns that may be protected by exchange con-
trols, just as in the short-term market. Since the national capital markets are generally small, 
opportunities to use them are quite limited for foreign as well as domestic investors. Of course, 
since the main currencies of interest to MNEs and other international investors  are  those of 
the few large industrial countries, opportunities in those national capital markets do exist.

 Until recently, the scope of ﬁ nancial markets and instruments was predominantly domes-
tic or fully international, but not regional. In the past two decades, however, the European 
Union has designed both a regional monetary system (the  European Monetary Union , or 
EMU) and a regional currency unit (the euro) for intergovernmental ﬁ nancial transactions 
in the European Union.  
 The eurocurrency market 
 A  eurodollar   is a dollar-denominated bank deposit located outside the United States. This 
simple statement deﬁ nes the basic instrument called the eurodollar. (Eurodollars are  not 
dollars in the pockets of people who live in Europe! They are deposit liabilities of banks.) 
The widely discussed eurocurrency market is simply a set of bank deposits located outside 
the countries whose currencies are used in the deposits. Since over half of the deposits 
are denominated in US dollars, it is reasonably accurate to call this the eurodollar market. 
Notice that the eurodollar market is not limited to Europe; very large eurodollar markets 
exist in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Bahrain, Panama, and other cities throughout the world. For 
this reason, the eurodollar market is sometimes called the  international money market .  
 What is the significance of the international money market? Since the eurocurrency 
market rivals domestic financial markets as a funding source for corporate borrowing, 
it plays a key role in the capital investment decisions of many firms. In addition, since 
this market also rivals domestic financial markets as a deposit alternative, it absorbs large 
amounts of savings from lenders (that is, depositors) in many countries. In fact, the euro-
currency market complements the domestic financial markets, giving greater access to

borrowing and lending to financial market participants in each country where it is permit-
ted to function. Overall, the eurocurrency market is now the world’s single most important 
market for international financial intermediation. 
 This market is completely a creation of the regulatory structures placed by national gov-
ernments on banking or, more precisely, on financial intermediation. If national govern-
ments allowed banks to function without reserve requirements, interest rate restrictions, 
capital controls, and taxes, the eurocurrency market would involve only the transnational 
deposits and loans made in each country’s banking system. Instead, national governments 
heavily regulate national financial markets in efforts to achieve various monetary policy 
goals. Thus, the eurocurrency market provides a very important outlet for funds flows that 
circumvent many of the limitations placed on domestic financial markets. Many national 
governments have found the impact of the eurocurrency market on their firms and banks 
to be favorable, so they have allowed this market to operate.       7 
 Since the eurocurrency market is a creation of the regulatory structure, it may be helpful 
to think about the key underpinnings of the system that allow eurodollars. Essentially three 
conditions must be met for a eurocurrency market to exist. First, some national government 
must allow foreign currency deposits to be made so that, for example, depositors in London 
can obtain dollar-denominated time deposits there. Second, the country whose currency 
is being used—in this example, the United States—must allow foreign entities to own and 
exchange deposits in that currency. Third, there must be some reason, such as low cost or ease 
of use, that prompts people to use this market rather than other financial markets, such as the 
domestic ones. The eurocurrency market has met these conditions for the past three decades, 
and its phenomenal growth testifies that the demand for such a market has been very large. 
 A wide range of countries allow foreign currency deposits to be held in their banking 
systems. Many of them impose restrictions (interest rate limits, capital controls, and so 
on) on these as well as on local-currency deposits, so that a free market does not exist. 
Other countries, including most of the developed countries and many of the newly indus-
trializing countries, allow foreign currency deposits that are not subject to the regulations 
placed on domestic deposits. In such countries, participants find more favorable interest 
rates, greater availability of funds, and greater ease of moving funds internationally. These 
countries tend to be the euromarket centers. 
 Only a few currencies have become popular as eurocurrencies. Generally, these are the 
ones used widely in international trade—the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and 
the Japanese yen. The governments of all the nations whose currencies are being used have 
consented (or, more accurately, have not objected) to allowing foreign banks, companies, 
and individuals to hold and use deposits denominated in those currencies. This may 
appear to be a trivial point, but any limitation on non-residents’ use of dollar (or other 
eurocurrency) deposits would quickly eliminate that currency from the euromarket. The 
US government’s temporary freeze on Iranian assets held in US banks in 1979 caused a 
tremendous crisis in the eurodollar market, because other participants saw the possibility 
of losing use of their eurodollars at the whim of the US government. The potential prob-
lem will continue to exist, but on the whole participants in the euromarket expect that full 
freedom to use the (dollar-denominated) deposits will continue indefinitely. 
 The third condition fundamental to the success of the euromarket is that it must possess 
advantages that will attract participants to the market. Those advantages include the ability 
to carry out dollar-denominated transactions outside the United States and the availability 
of favorable interest rates relative to rates in the domestic market. The first advantage clearly 
exists, because eurodollar account owners can sell their accounts to pay for other transac-
tions, with no need to deal directly in the United States. The second advantage also exists, 
primarily because lack of regulation of the euromarket allows banks to reduce their costs and 
pass on the savings to clients in the form of lower loan rates and higher deposit rates. (The 
difference in lending rates to prime borrowers essentially disappeared during the 1980s.)  

217
CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
 Eurocurrency interest rates 
 The base interest rate paid on deposits among banks in the eurocurrency market is called 
 LIBOR  . (Outside London, which is the center of the entire euromarket, the base rate on 
deposits is generally slightly higher.) LIBOR is determined by the supply and demand for 
funds in the euromarket for each currency. Because participating banks could default (and, 
infrequently, do default) on their obligations, the rate paid for eurodollar deposits is always 
somewhat above the domestic Treasury bill rate. Also, because domestic banks must comply 
with Federal Reserve requirements, they offer slightly lower deposit rates than unregulated 
eurobanks. The history of the LIBOR rates is shown in  Figure   7.4   .   
 The lending rate has no name comparable to the prime rate, but it is determined as LIBOR 
plus some margin, or spread, charged to the borrower. Banks generally do not require com-
pensating balances or other implicit charges in addition to the spread over LIBOR in the 
euromarket. This also helps reduce the cost of using the euromarket for borrowers. The total 
cost of borrowing in the euromarket for a prime US corporation historically was marginally 
below the domestic US prime rate. Because of competition among lenders in both markets, 
prime borrowers have been able to obtain the same rate in both markets since the early 1980s. 
 Interest rates on other eurocurrencies generally follow the same pattern, though when 
capital controls exist in a particular country (say, France), borrowing rates may be higher 
in the euromarket (which is not restricted) than in the domestic market.  Figure   7.5    traces 
three-month eurocurrency deposit rates during the past two decades. Notice that the 
countries whose currencies have tended to decline relative to other currencies during this 
period (such as France and the UK) show generally higher eurocurrency deposit rates than 
the “strong-currency” countries (such as Germany and Japan).  
 Other market characteristics 
 Transactions in the eurodollar market generally involve $1 million or more, although in 
the past several years many deposits of $50,000 to $100,000 have been given at LIBOR, 
and loans of similar amounts have been offered at the analogous lending rates. The mar-
ket is directly accessible to banks, which carry out about three-fourths of the total volume 
of transactions among themselves. Companies and individuals participate through their 
banks, generally at interest rates slightly less favorable than those offered among banks.

funds in the United States, when the funds themselves place large portions of their pooled 
investments in eurodollar accounts.)  
  Criticisms of the euromarkets 
 Over the years, the eurodollar market has been criticized as contributing to worldwide 
inﬂ ation and creating major new risks in the international banking system. While neither 
claim has been proved (or disproved) conclusively, each is worth considering here. 
 Because the eurodollar market adds to the worldwide volume of dollar-denominated 
assets, it has been accused of increasing the global money supply beyond the control of 
the US authorities. This may be true to some extent, but a number of factors mitigate the 
total impact of eurodollars. First, eurodollars exist only as time deposits and certificates of 
deposit, never as demand deposits or cash. Hence, in the narrow definition of money that 
includes only cash and demand deposits, eurodollars do not even appear at all. Second, 
as already noted, about three-fourths of all eurodollars are interbank deposits rather than 
new credit to companies or individuals that may use it for capital investment and thus 
economic growth. The interbank transfers (sometimes called  pyramiding ) do not create 
any new credit, however measured. Finally, the eurodollar deposits used by companies 
and individuals for investment and consumption probably replace other (for example, 
domestic) bank deposits that would have been used for the same purposes anyhow. That is, 
because the eurodollar deposits pay interest rates higher than domestic deposits, they often 
substitute for domestic deposits, and thus they are used for the same purposes that those 
deposits would have served. All in all, eurodollars probably add slightly to the total volume 
of economic activity worldwide because they provide a form of financial intermediation 
between depositors (savers) in many countries and borrowers (investors or spenders) in 
many countries that is more efficient than that of individual domestic financial markets. 
 On the issue of increased risk, it has been argued that the eurocurrency market has 
led to much greater extension of loans to troubled borrowers, such as the governments 
of less developed countries that found it virtually impossible to repay in the 1980s. 
Unquestionably, the eurodollar market provided the mechanism through which these 
governments borrowed most of the money loaned to them in the 1970s. It is not clear, 
however, that any other financial markets would have fared any differently in the absence

as they manage the other businesses in which they participate.

How can Barclays use the eurocurrency market in its international business, 
and will this help in dealing with the exchange rate problem? 
 Barclays can and does use the eurocurrency market for much of its international lending, 
since conditions in this market favor the large clients and banks with which Barclays deals 
extensively. Barclays can offer eurodeposits for various maturities in various currencies 
to its clients, and the bank can use this market to find offsetting exposures such as loans 
or investments in those same currencies and maturities.   
 Eurobonds and euroequities 
 Eurobonds are the long-term analogue of eurocurrencies. They are issued in countries of con-
venience and denominated in currencies other than the local one. With eurobonds,  taxation 
of the interest income that investors receive is a key concern, so most of them are issued in tax 
jurisdictions that do not impose taxes on such interest payments (for example, Luxembourg). 
Eurobonds, like domestic US bonds, are issued by corporations and government agencies. 
They may be convertible into equity, and they may have ﬁ xed or ﬂ oating interest rates. 
 Borrowers (namely, issuers of eurobonds) utilize this market for three main reasons. 
First, no regulatory agency establishes rules for disclosure by issuers, so substantial red 
tape is avoided; however, this generally limits participation to blue-chip corporations and 
governments. Second, the interest rates can be marginally lower than those on domestic 
issues, because investors can usually avoid taxes on their interest income. Third, the issuer 
gains access to potential investors in many countries simultaneously because the invest-
ment banks that place the issue offer it internationally. From time to time, eurobond issue 
is stimulated by additional reasons, such as domestic bond market restrictions that lead 
issuers to seek overseas funding. In 1964, for example, the United States established capital 
controls that made foreign bonds less attractive to US investors (the interest equalization 
tax was effectively a tax on interest received by US citizens from foreign bond investments) 
and limited lending by US parent companies to their foreign subsidiaries. As a result, both 
US and foreign issuers that were trying to place dollar-denominated bonds turned to the 
fledgling eurobond market for their funding. 
 For the investor, the eurobond market offers these advantages: (1) all issues are struc-
tured to allow exemption from interest withholding tax on the income earned; and (2) the 
terms of eurobond issues are more varied than those of domestic bond issues. For example, 
eurobonds usually have shorter maturities than domestic bonds (five to eight years) and 
often have floating-rate interest payments. 
 Euroequities 
 Euroequities have emerged in the past decade in the London Stock Exchange as another 
long-term euromarket, analogous to domestic stock markets. As the name implies, 
euroequities are shares of publicly traded stocks traded on an exchange outside the issuing 
ﬁ rm’s home country. They are bought and sold in shares denominated in the ﬁ rm’s home 

220
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
currency, so both company performance and exchange rate performance affect the returns 
on investments in euroequities. 
 In the United States, a market for such issues has operated for many years through an 
instrument called the American Depositary Receipt (ADR), which is essentially a claim on 
a share of stock in the foreign stock exchange intermediated by a securities broker who 
issues the ADR. Euroequities rival ADRs and offer the flexibility of being direct share issues 
by the non-local firms. The market exists primarily in London, and thus it encompasses 
non-British company shares. In fact, even the ADRs of British companies are now traded 
on the London Stock Exchange, so full global trading is possible through the exchange. 
 The London Stock Exchange euroequity market grew rapidly in the late 1980s. By 
1989, 52 brokerage firms were making a market for euroequities issued by 707 firms. The 
monthly turnover during January 1989 was 278 million shares. The growing demand for 
these instruments (based on the firms available for investment and the tax-avoiding struc-
ture of the issues), as well as the growing supply (by firms that are blue chip and want to 
gain access to investors from many countries through the London Stock Exchange), make 
it likely that this market will increase in importance in global equities trading.  
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 AngloGold Ashanti 
 When it comes to international finance, one of the primary 
concerns of MNEs is the ability to raise capital through 
new stock offerings and bank loans. For many years this 
was a major problem for the Anglo American Corporation 
of South Africa (AAC), which operated gold mines in that 
country. During South Africa’s apartheid period, trade sanc-
tions, controls on exchange currency, and protectionism all 
combined to isolate AAC from outside financial markets. 
Unable to do business in the international arena, AAC 
focused on expanding its domestic operations by acquiring 
holdings in a variety of industries including automobiles, 
newspapers, and vineyards. 
 As apartheid came to an end, however, there was a 
gradual liberalization of both trade and investment. And as 
its opportunity to move into the international arena began 
to increase, the firm put its gold mining activities into a new 
subsidiary, AngloGold, and began restructuring its oper-
ations. Non-core businesses were sold off and the company 
began focusing heavily on development of its gold and 
uranium mines. However, its profitability and performance 
were handicapped by the small size of the South African 
economy and the fact that the Johannesburg stock market 
was not very influential in the worldwide financial markets. 
In addition, the local currency, the rand, was weak and 
the company needed to tie its operations to a stronger 
currency.  
 In response, AngloGold determined that it needed to 
link itself to the triad and expand its mining operations

 Sometimes an MNE will lend money in the international money market. For example, if 
Bank of America finds that it can get a higher interest rate in Singapore than in the United 
States, it may deposit some money there. Similarly, if General Motors finds that there are

worldwide. As a result, in 1998 the company was listed on 
the New York Stock Exchange, and today it is also listed on 
the Ghana and Australian Stock Exchanges. The firm now 
has access to equity capital in the EU and North America, 
as well as Australia. In 2003 AngloGold merged with 
Ashanti Goldfields, so that the combined firm had mines in 
eight countries and a total market capitalization of about 
$3.5 billion in 2004. AngloGold Ashanti has 21 operations 
and a number of exploration programs in gold-producing 
regions of the world. As of December 31, 2009, AngloGold 
Ashanti’s ore reserve totalled 71.4 million ounces. During 
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company produced 
4.6 million ounces of gold from its operations. AngloGold 
Ashanti’s main product is gold. Revenue is also derived 
from the sales of silver, uranium oxide and sulphuric acid.

 The last international ﬁ nancial market we will examine here may be viewed as either a 
very important framework for international ﬁ nancial dealings or a market that is generally 
irrelevant to private business managers. The   international monetary system   is a ﬁ nancial 
market in which only central banks and the  International Monetary Fund (IMF, or “the 
Fund”) operate, so private business plays no active role in it. On the other hand, rules for 
international ﬁ nancial dealings among countries are often set at the IMF, and substantial 
international loan decisions are made between governments and the IMF. Thus, the rules 
of the game in the other international ﬁ nancial markets are sometimes inﬂ uenced by IMF 
activities. 
 The international monetary system oversees the exchange rate regime that prevails 
among the major developed countries, whose currencies are used for the vast majority of 
international payments. The IMF negotiates with governments of debtor nations (usually 
less developed countries) for loans directly from the Fund and for loan conditions that 
are used, subsequently, as a basis for lending by private banks to these same borrowers. In 
addition, the IMF serves as an intermediary for emergency loans between member govern-
ments to cope with the capital flow or exchange rate crises that occur from time to time 
due to speculation in foreign exchange markets or other causes. All in all, the international 
monetary system plays an important role in determining the rules of the game for private 
companies and banks in some spheres of international business, so managers need to 
understand its functioning. 
 The IMF was designed in 1944 at a conference of the Allied nations held at Bretton 
Woods, New Hampshire. Its general purpose was to provide a multilateral framework for 
avoiding international financial crises by establishing rules for national exchange rate pol-
icies and for adjustment to balance of payments disequilibria (discussed in the Appendix 
to  Chapter 6 ). It was specifically intended to avoid the disastrous financial contraction that

occurred during the 1930s. As originally negotiated, and as implemented in 1946 when 
the Articles of Agreement were signed by the initial 46 member countries, the IMF system 
required  fixed  exchange rates among member countries, with gold as the basis for currency 
valuation. The US dollar was initially fixed at a value of $35 per ounce of gold, and all other 
currencies were fixed at values expressed in both dollars and gold. 
 Fixed exchange rates were a fundamental base of the Bretton Woods system. Under the 
Articles of Agreement, each country was obligated to maintain its currency value at the 
initially set value (the “par” value), with a band of ±1 percent of flexibility around the par 
value. If a foreign central bank demanded to sell a country’s currency back to the issuer, 
that country was required to pay the equivalent amount of gold, US dollars, or some other 
acceptable currency. 
 To join the IMF, a country was required to make a deposit of gold (25 percent), plus its 
own currency (75 percent), such that each member country’s total deposit relative to the 
total of IMF deposits was roughly in proportion with its share of world trade. Then each 
member country received the right to borrow up to 200 percent of its initial deposit at the 
Fund, in any currency, to help pay for imbalances such as the one mentioned above. If a 
country borrowed more than its original deposit, the IMF would stipulate economic pol-
icies that the borrower had to follow to receive more financial support. (This imposition 
of policy demands by the IMF is called  conditionality .) 
 While the IMF sought to provide assistance for nations facing balance of payments 
problems, its only resources were the contributions of its member countries: quotas based 
on each country’s part in world trade, which initially constituted about $9 billion. This 
relatively small amount of liquidity was not sufficient to support the post-World War 
II economic recovery, or specifically the payments imbalances, of even the European 
 countries. 8  Ultimately, the US Marshall Plan injected the needed funding into the inter-
national financial system, and specifically into Europe, during 1948–1952. 
 In fact, the IMF provided very little funding to its member countries in its early years. 
During the Suez crisis in 1956, it loaned $1.7 billion to the UK, France, and India. Later, 
during speculative runs on the British pound (that is, periods when   speculators sold large 
quantities of pounds for other currencies in expectation of a devaluation of the pound) in 
1961 and 1964, it extended loans to the UK. By the end of the 1960s, the IMF was regularly 
providing credit to member countries, though still not at the levels that many analysts 
believed necessary to stabilize the system. (The alternative view is that the IMF should not 
provide credit to the member countries at all; rather, these countries should be forced to 
adjust their economies to escape balance of payments problems.)  
 At the end of the 1960s, the US dollar began to be the object of speculative pressure. 
The problem was severe, since the dollar constituted the base for the entire system of value 
(through its formal link to gold at $35 per ounce). The United States was unable to devalue 
to stop the speculation, and later it was unwilling to continue selling its gold holdings 
to foreign central banks that wanted to redeem their dollars. In August 1971, President 
Nixon announced that the United States would no longer sell gold to foreign central banks 
in exchange for dollars. In December 1971, he announced a devaluation of the dollar to 
$38 per ounce of gold; in February 1972 it was devalued to $42 per ounce, and later that year 
the United States declared that it would not support the dollar value at any price in gold. 
 These events essentially destroyed the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. 
Many initiatives to repair the system were presented during the following two years, but the 
United States would no longer accept the responsibility of providing the dollar as a fixed 
base for other currencies. In subsequent months, the IMF system was changed de facto to 
a floating exchange rate system that allowed each country to leave the value of its currency 
free to change with market forces or to fix that value to some other currency. Since that 
time, the United States has allowed the dollar to float in value relative to all other currencies,

CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
with occasional efforts by the Fed (the Federal Reserve System) to influence the dollar’s 
re lationship to particular currencies, such as the former German mark and the Japanese yen. 
 Under the current IMF system, no limitations are set on each member country’s decision 
either to fix its currency value relative to some other currency or to allow it to fluctuate as 
supply and demand dictate. (Note that it is impossible for one country to keep its currency 
fixed relative to all others if the others are not fixed relative to one another.) In 1976, an 
accord called the Jamaica Agreement altered the IMF charter to formally allow for float-
ing exchange rates. Today, the exchange rate regimes used by each nation are substantially 
unrestricted, and government strategies to influence exchange rates are altered as desired.       9 
 At about the same time that the link between the dollar and gold was broken, the IMF’s 
members agreed to create a new currency that the Fund would issue when authorized to do 
so by a vote of the members. This currency, called the   special drawing right (SDR), allows 
its holder to obtain (or draw) other currencies from the IMF (or from other members) 
when desired. SDRs have been created and issued on seven occasions to date. A total SDR 
of 21.4 billion existed in 2004; the total value was about $30 billion. In each instance, the 
SDRs were allocated to Fund members according to their quotas. This new “international 
money” has served to support a number of countries that encountered financial crises 
since 1971, allowing them to finance their imbalances, but it has not been a solution to 
imbalances in international financial flows. During the international debt crisis of the early 
1980s, SDR use was wholly inadequate to deal with the more than $350 billion of dollar 
debt owed by Latin American countries to foreign lenders. Total IMF resources include 
member country quotas, which totaled over $300 billion at the end of 2004. With a gen-
eral SDR allocation that took effect on August 28 and a special allocation on September 9, 
2009, the amount of SDRs increased from SDR 21.4 billion to SDR 204 billion (equivalent 
to about $308 billion, converted using the rate of August 31, 2010).  S o the Fund actually 
has quite substantial lending power today.   
 During the late twentieth century, SDRs became fairly widely used as a currency of 
denomination for private-sector financial instruments such as bonds and long-term bank 
loans. Because the SDR has a value based on four currencies (see  Figure   7.6   ), it is more 
stable as a borrowing or lending tool than any individual currency. As of 2006 an SDR con-
sists of US dollars, euros, Japanese yen, and British pounds, and their relative contributions 
are 44, 34, 11, and 11 percent respectively.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 When the dollar devalues relative to other widely traded currencies, so does the SDR—
but only 39 percent of the SDR’s value is affected negatively. The other 61 percent of the 
SDR’s value is based on pounds, yen, and euros, and these currencies may rise or fall 
relative to the dollar in such a situation. Overall, the changes must net out over all curren-
cies, and an instrument such as the SDR changes relatively little in value compared to any 
single currency. The SDR is really a “basket” of currencies whose value is generally more 
stable than that of any one of its components. 
 Just as the euro has gained wide acceptance as an instrument for denominating inter-
national financial transactions, so the SDR promises to maintain its acceptance as a risk-
reducing instrument. (The SDR has the advantage of including the US dollar in the group 
of currencies that determine its value, whereas the euro is based only on European curren-
cies.) At present private-sector investors and borrowers are using a much greater volume 
and value of euro-denominated instruments than SDR-denominated instruments. 
  Unresolved problems with the IMF system 
 The IMF system today differs dramatically from the model established at Bretton Woods 
in 1944. Flexible exchange rates have been substituted for ﬁ xed ones; gold has been greatly 
reduced as an international monetary asset, 10  and its link to the dollar has been severed; a 
new reserve currency, the SDR, has been created to increase world liquidity; and, perhaps 
most important, the US dollar is no longer the single base for the IMF system of value. 
These major changes have come in response to problems and crises that have occurred dur-
ing the past 60 years—yet the IMF system itself survives. While few people would argue that 
the IMF has led directly to greater international ﬁ nancial stability over its history, at least the 
system has been ﬂ exible enough to accommodate the various crises that have threatened it. 
 Several problems that remain in the system deserve note. First, there has always been 
an uncomfortable tension between the countries that want to utilize the IMF simply as a 
bank for reducing the negative impacts of balance of payments difficulties and the coun-
tries that want to utilize it to subsidize economic development. The “link” between the 
IMF and development finance was originally delegated to the   World Bank   (the IMF’ sister 
insti tution). Traditionally, the IMF has loaned funds only for short-term uses, sometimes 
extending to two or three years. Many borrowing countries, especially the less developed 
ones, have repeatedly called for greater use of IMF resources to finance development 
projects. While there are often no clear differences between financing payments imbal-
ances and financing development projects that may later reduce those imbalances, the 
IMF has not substantially widened its scope. In the 1980s, under the cloud of multiple 
international loan renegotiations by Latin American countries, the Fund began to extend 
longer-term loans and to reconsider its strategy. The ultimate result of this crisis is, in the 
early 2000s, that the Fund retained its basic form, and the resources of the World Bank 
expanded to assist more heavily in economic development.  
 A second problem that continues to plague the Fund is the issue of exchange rate 
regimes. Even as the flexible rate system moves through its fourth decade, there are 
repeated calls for a return to fixed, or more tightly constrained, currency values. The great 
instability of international financial dealings during the period since the initial OPEC oil 
crisis of 1973–1974 has led some analysts to argue for a return to fixed rates. The decision 
of most European Union countries to set up a single currency, the euro, has placed a 
regional fixed exchange rate regime alongside of the floating rate system globally. The 
 evidence during the entire twentieth century tends to suggest that no matter what exchange 
rate regime prevails, if international trade relations are unstable and payments imbalances 
are substantial, no exchange rate regime will be able to solve the problem. Thus, this prob-
lem most likely cannot be eliminated.

CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
 On the whole, the international monetary system plays an important role in all inter-
national financial dealings by being the focal point for establishing rules on exchange rates, 
exchange controls, intergovernmental loans, and other official transactions. On a day-to-
day basis, most international business people, especially in the triad countries, do not feel 
the international monetary system’s impact.   
 Whether or not a company or bank is involved in international trade, investment, or other 
international business, it is important that its managers understand some of the key aspects 
of international ﬁ nancial markets. The eurocurrency market may offer a low-cost borrow-
ing opportunity, or the eurobond market may provide an outlet for selling new debt to 
a wider group of investors. The international monetary system establishes a framework 
within which governments set international ﬁ nancial policies that may affect many ﬁ rms. 
The money and capital markets in foreign countries may offer opportunities to multi-
national ﬁ rms that operate in those countries. The foreign exchange market determines 
the cost and availability of foreign currencies, used in business by many ﬁ rms. Finally, all 
of these markets inﬂ uence the functioning of the markets for real goods and services, the 
ultimate use for all ﬁ nancial claims. 
 MNEs AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL 
MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS 
 1   Foreign exchange is any financial instrument that can be used to carry out payment 
from one currency to another. There are two major foreign exchange markets in the 
United States and the UK: interbank (including brokers) and futures/options (at stock 
and commodities exchanges). The most important participants in foreign exchange 
markets are banks—acting as traders, speculators, hedgers, and arbitrageurs. Exchange 
rates are determined by the activities of these five groups. The rates are also influenced by 
purchasing power parity, interest rates, and technical factors such as national economic 
statistics and seasonal demands. 
 2   There are a number of international finance strategies that can be of value to firms 
doing business overseas. Two of the most important are strategies for managing cur-
rency exchange rate risk and strategies for financing international operations.  
 3   The international monetary system is a market among central banks of the countries 
that belong to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF’s objectives include the 
facilitation of balanced growth of international trade, promotion of exchange stability, 
and the making of financial resources available to the members of the Fund. In recent 
years the fixed monetary system created by the IMF members in 1944 has been replaced 
by a managed float system. Currently the IMF faces a number of major problems, 
including helping Third World countries to deal with their international debt crises and 
increasing international liquidity.

 1  If your firm had a subsidiary in Japan and about 100 million yen in exposed assets 
(that is, plant and equipment), how would you protect it against exchange risk?   
 2  If you managed the European operations of a large US-based MNE, in what 
market(s) would you seek long-term funding? Why?   
 3  Given that the euro area’s inflation is about 3 percent per year at present, while 
US inflation is about 2 percent per year, what do you expect to happen to the 
euro/dollar exchange rate in the next few months? Why?   
 4  What is the difference between a eurobond and a domestic bond in the United 
States? Which one would you prefer to issue as a company manager? Which one 
would you prefer to buy as an investor? Why?   
 5  How can a firm such as Ajax Steel in Peoria, Illinois, utilize the eurodollar market 
to minimize its financing costs? This firm is a medium-size manufacturer with no 
foreign sales.   
 6  Assume that the interest rate on 12-month US dollar deposits in London is 
currently 2.6875 percent per year and the rate on British pound deposits there 
is 4.1875 percent per year. The spot exchange rate is US $1.93/£. What do you 
expect the exchange rate to be in one year?

CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
 REAL CASE 
 HSBC 
 What is the world’s largest bank? Prior to the merger of 
Citicorp and Travelers in 1998, it was the Hong Kong and 
Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). As at December 
31, 2009, HSBC is the world’s eighth largest banking and 
financial services group and the UK’s No.1 largest banking 
group (Fortune Global 500, 2010 ranking). Formed in 1865 
by a Scotsman in the then British Colony of Hong Kong, 
HSBC grew to over 10,000 bank offices in 76 countries by 
2009. In the process it became the world’s first truly global 
bank, offering a full range of financial services from retail 
to corporate banking to insurance and financial manage-
ment. HSBC built this global business based on its strong 
Hong Kong base. The bank owns the Hong Kong Bank and 
most of the Hang Seng Bank, giving it over 40 percent of the 
market in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of 
China that was created on July 1, 1997. 
 Perhaps less well known is that HSBC is also the owner 
of the former Midland Bank chain in the UK, the Marine 
Midland and Republic New York Banks and Household 
Finance in the United States, and the Hong Kong Bank of 
Canada. It has also acquired large banks in Latin America 
including Banco Bamerindus in Brazil and Bital in Mexico. 
In all these cases HSBC greatly improved the efficiency of 
the underperforming local banks through better systems 
and processes. Over recent years, HSBC has implemented 
a rebranding strategy of all its subsidiaries under the 
HSBC title and logo “the world’s local bank”. This is meant 
to build HSBC into a global brand. 
 Today HSBC is well developed across the triad regions 
of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. It is a global bank in 
terms of assets, but not revenues. Its diversification strat-
egy has helped to insulate it from the Asian financial crisis 
1997–1998.  
 There is an old saying that the best test of a business is 
how well it does in a downturn. Again in the world financial 
crisis starting in 2007, HSBC looked pretty good. HSBC 
reported revenue of $142.069 billion and profits after tax 
of $5.728 billion for 2008. Although revenue was down 
3 percent on a year earlier, but that looked very healthy 
compared to sickly peers such as Citigroup, UBS, and 
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). RBS required a British gov-
ernment bailout.  
 HSBC was thriving because of its strong presence 
in emerging markets including India, China, the Middle 
East, and Brazil to cushion the big losses it took in the 
US market due to subprime mortgage crisis. Since 2007, 
HSBC expanded into Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and India by 
launching new branches and services. Profits in some of 
HSBC’s Middle East businesses, such as capital markets 
and private banking, were growing at a near 100 percent. 
HSBC reported revenue of $103.736 billion and profits after 
tax of $5.834 billion for 2009.  
 Significant events in 2009 included its decision to sell 
landmark buildings in New York, London and Paris to 
raise cash. HSBC agreed to sell its London base at Canary 
Wharf to the National Pension Service of Korea for $1.25 
billion in cash and its New York headquarters to Israeli 
investment holding IDB Group for $330 million. HSBC 
sold its Paris building to private investors represented by 
French Properties Management for $573 million. HSBC 
would lease back these buildings. Importantly, HSBC 
announced in 2009 that it relocated the principal office of 
the Group Chief Executive to Hong Kong. This underscores 
HSBC commitments to emerging markets’ businesses and 
reflects the historic shifts now taking place in the world 
economy. HSBC’s corporate headquarters remain in the 
UK where it continues to benefit from being at the heart of 
the world’s financial centers.  
 And its first-mover advantage as a truly global bank may 
prove hard to match by its competitors. There is constant 
pressure in banking to reduce costs through greater scale 
economies and improved information technology. HSBC is 
well positioned to continue as an industry leader because 
of its successful strategy.  
 In retrospect, one of the world’s largest banks came 
from one of the world’s smallest economies. And it did this 
despite the regulatory barriers to entry for foreign-owned 
firms in Europe and North America. As a result HSBC is 
an example of a bank using modern management systems 
and market forces to win out over old-fashioned protec-
tionism in a highly regulated worldwide industry. 
 Perhaps the biggest influence of HSBC and its new 
 efficient banking methods has been on British banking. 
A further restructuring occurred in British banking in 
November 1999 when one of the country’s four major banks 
(Lloyds, Barclays, Natwest, and HSBC) was taken over by 
a much smaller bank. Natwest was acquired by the Royal 
Bank of Scotland, only one-third the asset size of Natwest, 
in a drawn-out and controversial takeover. Another bank, 
the Bank of Scotland, first bid for Natwest and the takeover 
efforts of both the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of 
Scotland were defended by Natwest Chairman, Sir David 
Rowland, who was also President of Templeton College, 
University of Oxford. The takeover was successful because 
▼

228
PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
investors were critical of Natwest’s old-style management 
and were supportive of the cost-cutting and new infor-
mation technology methods of the Royal Bank of Scotland. 
After the acquisition, many Natwest branches were closed; 
bank buildings were turned into coffee bars, restaurants, 
and hotels; and a leaner, more efficient bank emerged to 
reclaim its place in British retail banking. 
 The Bank of Scotland and Halifax, the largest mortgage 
lender in the country, finalized a merger. This has fast-
forwarded Halifax into mainstream banking and greatly 
increased the Bank of Scotland’s scope of operations. 
Halifax then became a trading name of Bank of Scotland. 
The merger would also allow both banks to streamline 
their businesses and increase their market focus. These 
efforts toward restructuring operations and eliminating 
waste are not going unnoticed by rival banks. Barclays, for 
example, closed some of its branches in the early 2000s 
and introduced a wide array of tools and techniques that are 
designed to cut costs and increase operational efficiency. 
It realizes that, to be a successful international oper ation, 
it must not only have wide geographic coverage but also 
be able to offer efficient services. A takeover of Bank of 
Scotland by Lloyds TSB was approved by the Court of 
Session on January 12, 2009. On January 19, 2009, Bank of 
Scotland formally became part of Lloyds Banking Group. 
 In looking at these recent developments, it is clear that 
the steps taken by HSBC to modernize its own operations 
are proving to be a wake-up call for British banks as well.

 REAL CASE 
 World financial crises 
 Throughout the 1990s, a series of financial crises rocked 
the world’ economy. The first of these was the 1994 Mexico 
peso crisis. This was followed by the Asian crisis of 1997. 
Since then there have been the Russian crisis of 1998, the 
1999 Brazilian financial crisis, the 2001 Argentine crisis, 
and the 2007 world financial crisis. The following examines 
the first two of these. 
  The Mexican peso crisis 
 In late 1994 Mexico suffered one of the worst financial cri-
ses in its history. In less than one month the Mexican peso 
devalued from 3.45 to the US dollar to 5.57 to the dollar, 
and by the end of 1995 it was trading at 6.5 to the dollar. 
This was accompanied by heavy inflation, unemployment, 
and a severe stock market crash. Some critics claimed 
that all of this was a result of NAFTA, but this was not so. 
The crisis was caused by the Mexican government itself, 
which had liberalized trade and financial flows but had not 
allowed the peso to float. Moreover, previous governments 
had kept the peso overvalued. As a result, in less than one 
year Mexico’s foreign reserves were depleted by 75 percent 
and the country’s current account deficit was equal to 8 per-
cent of GDP.  
 Other factors also contributed to the low price of the 
peso. For instance, as a result of the Zapatista armed 
rebellion of 1996 in Chiapas, in southern Mexico, both

CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
foreign and Mexican investors took tens of millions of 
 dollars out of the country. These developments had far-
reaching consequences throughout the region. For ex ample, 
many investors in other Latin American countries, fearing a 
similar crash, withdrew their funds from these eco nomies 
and deposited them in the United States for safe keeping. 
 One unexpected development of the Mexican peso crisis 
was the devaluation of the Canadian dollar, which was 
sideswiped by the Latin American currency crisis. Thanks 
to NAFTA, Canada and Mexico had become linked in the 
international currency markets. At the same time inter-
national investors began showing a preference for the US 
dollar against both the Mexican peso and the Canadian 
dollar. 
 Perhaps the most surprising thing about the peso 
crisis was how quickly the country bounded back. With 
the help of a $50 billion loan from the United States and 
other countries, a tough economic reform that saw cuts in 
government spending, and increases in deregulation and 
privatization, the Mexican economy began to revive. Hardly 
a year had passed when investors who were running from 
the region were quickly lured back by short-term interest 
rates of up to 40 percent. Additionally, the stock market 
crash had led to underpriced shares, and investors began 
buying these issues and driving the prices back up. Today 
the financial crisis of 1995 in Mexico is a thing of the past. 
The country’ economy is healthy and investors are back.  
  The Asian financial crisis 
 In the early 1990s, the Asian economies of South Korea, 
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan were being 
praised as economic miracles. In 1997, these countries 
faced one of the worst blows to their economies. The Asian 
crisis began in July 1997, when Thailand stopped peg-
ging its currency to the US dollar. In two months the Thai 
bath had devaluated by nearly 40 percent. The effect was 
twofold. First, Asian exporters to Thailand faced decreased 
demand for their product. Second, there was the decrease 
of investor confidence in the region. 
 Individual countries in the region faced their own sets 
of problems. In Malaysia, it was excessive lending to the 
property sector. Once foreign investment was cut short, 
overlending, overinvestment, and overproduction led to 
a downward spiral in the economy. In South Korea, the 
 chaebols  (large manufacturing conglomerates) that domi-
nated the economy had invested recklessly without regard 
to profit. In Indonesia, President Suharto’s corruption and 
lack of accountability led investors to flee the country. In 
addition, the banking system that the government there 
had fostered was plagued with bad loans for many unreli-
able projects. These loans benefited and created wealth 
for well-positioned individuals—in particular, members of 
the Suharto family—but they did nothing for the rest of the 
country. 
 Some financial observers believe that Western specu-
lators were a major reason for the financial troubles in the 
region. The trend toward deregulation of the world capital 
markets and the free flow of capital, it was argued, contrib-
uted to the currency panic. Additionally, the relatively good 
health of these nations prior to 1997 made them attractive 
to foreign investors and lenders. Unfortunately, many of 
these loans were short term and were in foreign currency. 
So while the economy grew, the loans presented no prob-
lem. But when trouble looked likely the foreign lenders 
began calling in their loans. When this happened, the value 
of the local currencies plummeted and the loans payable in 
foreign currencies created a debt crisis. 
 It was initially believed that the Asian economic problem 
would be contained in that geographic region. However, 
by mid-1998 the crisis was having an effect on the world 
economy. The cross-border interconnections of global 
industries and the resulting interdependence pushed the 
problem to other regions. Among other things, the crisis 
led to decreases in the prices of many commodities includ-
ing oil, metals, grain, pulp, and paper. 
 Industrial nations came to the aid of these Asian govern-
ments. The IMF negotiated billions of dollars in bailouts. 
Initially, the IMF wanted these governments to decrease 
their budget deficit and to maintain stable interest rates. 
By July 1998, however, the IMF was allowing increases in 
deficits and lower interest rates. This helped ease some 
of the problems, although there was still a great deal of 
disagreement regarding what else needed to be done. For 
example, some observers argued that the government 
needed to continue to deregulate the country’s capital 
markets, while others blamed the economic disaster on 
this deregulation.

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
    1  Exchange rate quotations come as two-digit numbers, bid/
asked, with the preceding numbers assumed. A British 
pound quote of 50/70 on October 14, 2004, meant an actual 
price of: 
  $1.7950 bid to buy one British pound. 
 £1.7970 asked for selling one British pound.  
 The bank is offering (bidding) to buy pounds for 
1.795 dollars per pound and also offering (asking) to sell 
pounds for 1.797 dollars per pound. Of course, the actual 
transaction will involve $1 million or more, to be exchanged 
at those prices. 
 Rates are typically quoted on the  Continental basis , as 
units of foreign exchange per dollar, everywhere. US banks 
have traditionally used the  American basis , quoting $US 
per unit of foreign exchange. Clearly, whether the quote is 
SF2.0/$ or $0.50/SF, the value is the same. The  Wall Street 
Journal  offers both types of quotations, as shown in  Table   7.2   . 
  Another means used to distinguish the two ways of 
presenting an exchange rate is to call a quotation of domestic 
currency/foreign exchange an  indirect quote . Conversely, a 
quotation of units of foreign exchange/domestic currency is 
called a  direct quote . This system has more general applicability 
to any pair of currencies, whereas the American/ Continental 
system relates only to rates involving the US dollar.  
 2  See  http://www.chips.org . 
    3  “Taking a position” means purchasing an asset (or a 
liability) denominated in a foreign currency without 
simultaneously matching it with a liability (asset) of the 
same value and maturity in the same currency. Realistically, 
if any one government disallows the euromarkets, they can 
still function almost as effectively in other countries and 
currencies. At present, the US government has the most 
important role, since about 80 percent of eurodeposits are 
denominated in US dollars. If a US bank buys Swiss francs, 
it takes a position in Swiss francs. When the bank sells those 
Swiss francs to a client, it eliminates the position.  
 4  A  foreign currency option is a contract offering the holder 
the right to buy (namely, a  call option ) or sell (namely, a 
 put option ) a fixed amount of foreign currency for a fixed 
price during a fixed time period. The buyer of a call option 
on British pounds obtains the right to buy £31,500 at a fixed 
dollar price (that is, the  exercise price ) at any time during 
the (typically) three-month life of the option. The seller of 
the same option faces a  contingent liability in that the seller 
will have to deliver the British pounds at any time if the 
buyer chooses to exercise the option. 
   
  The market value (that is, the price on “premium” that 
the buyer must pay to purchase the option) of an option 
depends on its exercise price, the remaining time to its 
expiration, the exchange rate in the spot market, and 
expectations about the future exchange rate. An option 
may sell for a price near zero, for thousands of dollars, or 
for anywhere in between. Notice that the buyer of a call 
option on British pounds may pay a small price to obtain the 
option but does  not  have to exercise the option if the actual 
exchange rate moves favorably. Thus, an option is superior 
to a forward contract having the same maturity and exercise 
price because it need  not  be used, and the cost is just its 
purchase price. However, the price of the option is generally 
higher than the expected cost of the forward contract, so the 
user of the option pays for the flexibility of the instrument. 
    5  Yet another kind of foreign exchange arbitrage involves 
comparing interest rates on similar investments between two 
currencies. Interest arbitrage is the choice of investing, say, 
$1 million in a eurodollar bank deposit, versus investing the 
same money in pounds, depositing in a europound deposit, 
and contracting a forward contract to convert back to dollars. 
This comparison can be used for whatever currencies that 
may be available, and the investor benefits from taking the 
highest return available, with the exchange rates guaranteed 
through forward contracts (that is, with no exchange risk).  
    6  This entire discussion refers to  relative  purchasing power 
parity (PPP). The stronger, absolute version refers to parity 
in the values of factor inputs used in the production of 
products whose prices reflect relative factor productivities. 
Relative PPP considers only  changes  in the relative price 
levels between countries, not the initial (absolute) levels.  
    7  Realistically, if any one government disallows the 
euromarkets, they can still function almost as effectively 
in other countries and currencies. At present, the US 
government has the most important role, since about 
80 percent of eurodeposits are denominated in US dollars.  
    8  See the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948 (Public Law 472, 
80th Congress), US Code Congressional Service, 1948.  
 9  Exchange rate policies  are  constrained by the IMF if a 
country seeks to borrow more than its quota from the Fund. 
Also, a country does operate in violation of IMF rules if 
it imposes new exchange controls on current transactions 
without obtaining IMF approval; however, sanctions are 
seldom applied unless the country seeks to borrow as above.  
   10  Almost one-third of the world’s monetary reserves were still 
being held in the form of gold at year-end 1991. See IMF 
 Survey , November 8, 1993, p. 345.

CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
 In order to link Parts One and Two, this Appendix reports on recent research on the topic of 
multinationality and performance. A basic premise of international business is that foreign 
operations are proﬁ table—otherwise, they would not take place! Thus it is hypothesized 
that the performance of the ﬁ rm (usually an MNE) improves as its degree of foreign oper-
ations increases. 
 In Part One we have explored the reasons for MNEs and some ideas about why and 
how their degree of multinationality might increase across the home region, rather than 
globally. In Part Two we have examined country factors which (often indirectly) may affect 
firm performance. Thus, in this Appendix we bring these themes together by examining 
the regional aspects of multinationality and performance. 
 Introduction 
 Rugman (2005) has shown that the world’s largest ﬁ rms operate mainly on an intra-regional 
basis, in terms of both sales and assets. We relate traditional literature on multinational-
ity and performance to the new metrics available, which includes new data on regional 
sales and on the return on foreign assets. Several recent papers examine regionalization and 
performance across industries, others over time and for various regions of the triad. This 
recent empirical work provides a very useful starting point in bringing the regional nature 
of MNEs into the literature on multinationality and performance. 
 In the field of international business one of the most basic issues is the relationship 
between multinationality and performance. Several hundred studies have examined the 
nature of this relationship, with somewhat inconclusive results. Here this literature is 
reviewed and extended and then related to the regional dimension of multinationality and 
performance. The regional aspects of multinational activity are explored in Rugman and 
Verbeke (2004) and Rugman (2005). The traditional empirical work on multinationality 
and performance can be extended by including this regional dimension.  
  Recent research on the S curve 
 Contractor (2007) presents a theoretical justiﬁ cation for the three-stage  S  curve, see 
 Figure   7.7   . The horizontal axis represents the degree of multinationality, here proxied by 
 APPENDIX TO  CHAPTER 7 :  REGIONAL ASPECTS 
OF MULTINATIONALITY AND PERFORMANCE

PART TWO THE ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
the ratio of foreign (F) to total (T) sales, (F/T). The vertical axis represents a performance 
measure, here the return on total assets (ROTA). There is generally a positive relationship 
between these two variables. In an interesting twist Contractor argues that the middle stage 
is consistent with the observations on the regional nature of multinational activity. He also 
suggests that the ﬁ nal stage, where performance suffers due to excessive multinationality, 
is typically populated by relatively few ﬁ rms. This fall-off in performance beyond a certain 
threshold of multinationality may correspond to an attempt by some companies to reach 
a “global” stage. While these propositions remain to be tested, Contractor provides strong 
new insights into the possible relationship between the regional dimension of multi-
nationality activity and the emerging literature on the  S  curve. He also reviews seven generic 
reasons why studies of multinationality and performance yield different results, and he pro-
vides an agenda for research to further test the viability of the three-stage  S curve concept. 
  Regional versus total sales 
 Oh and Rugman (2007) provide new data examining the trends of regional sales between 
2001 and 2005. They start with the 2001 benchmark year used in the pathbreaking paper 
by Rugman and Verbeke (2004) as further developed in the databank reported in the book 
by Rugman (2005). They ﬁ nd a remarkable degree of stability over time where the ratio of 
regional to total sales averages 75.7 percent. They also provide data for the ﬁ rst time on the 
regional nature of assets of the world’s largest 500 ﬁ rms. This averages 76.7 percent again 
with less than a 1 percent variation over the ﬁ ve-year period. 
 Osegowitsch and Sammartino (2007) conduct an analysis by taking the set of 380 firms 
reported in Rugman and Verbeke (2004) and going back to 1991 to find trends in region-
alization over the period 1991–2001. One problem is that this yields a greatly reduced 
sample of 159 firms biased towards US firms. Indeed, most of their results exclude the 
Asian firms completely, and represent only 90 North American firms and 36 from Europe. 
Osegowitsch and Sammartino (2007) find that there is a reduction in intra-regional sales 
for this small set of US and European firms from 84 percent to 76 percent. Over this 
period they also find that some firms increase their sales outside their home region. They 
also find that a somewhat larger percentage of firms can be classified as biregional in con-
trast to those found in the Rugman and Verbeke (2004) chapter. However, in contrast to 
their own conclusions their own data actually confirm the main two insights of Rugman 
and Verbeke (2004). First, the vast majority of firms remain home region oriented over 
the 1991–2001 period. Second, there are very few global firms. Their chapter is useful in 
provoking a debate about trends in regionalization and hopefully a more extensive dataset 
can be constructed to help reconcile their findings with those of Oh and Rugman (2007). 
 Goerzen and Asmussen (2007) use a set of Japanese MNEs to test the relationship 
between regional and global firms. They argue correctly that the performance of a firm 
is determined by its firm-specific advantages (FSAs). They show that regional firms build 
more upon location-bound FSAs, especially in the marketing area. In contrast, global firms 
have technological (R&D) FSAs, and these are presumed to be non-location bound. They 
find evidence that the FSAs of global firms are less location bound than the FSAs of regional 
firms. This work needs to be extended beyond the Japanese dataset in order to test the gener-
alization of these findings. However, their theoretical logic is consistent with that of Rugman 
and Verbeke (2007), where it is argued that there is a liability of regional foreignness. In 
other words, the FSAs of MNEs are difficult to deploy and exploit outside the home region.  
 Gravity model 
 Hejazi (2007) introduces the logic of international economics and transaction costs to 
 analyze the regional dimension of the activities of MNEs. He uses the well-known gravity 

235
CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
model of international economics which has been used to analyze the importance of geog-
raphy on the determination of international trade ﬂ ows. He adapts the gravity model to 
measure foreign direct investment (FDI) instead of trade ﬂ ows. The gravity model  measures 
the country-level frictions affecting trade and can only be applied to FDI with some difﬁ -
culty as FDI is partly a method to overcome such frictions. Thus the gravity model yields a 
new type of test of the activities of MNEs, although it is not a direct test of their strategies. 
Hejazi ﬁ nds that there is a strong regional bias in the activities of MNEs from the EU, but 
he does not ﬁ nd this effect for North American MNEs, which is not surprising given the 
asymmetrical large size of the US market. (The size bias of the US market may also affect 
the results by Osegowitsch and Sammartino (2007).) While Hejazi does not test perform-
ance directly, his work offers new conceptual lenses on the nature of the regional dimen-
sion of multinationality. Such work using econometric techniques based on the gravity 
model needs to be taken up and related to the empirical literature on multinationality and 
performance. 
 Multinationality and performance 
 Bowen (2007) provides a theoretical critique of the extant empirical work in the multi-
nationality and performance literature. He points out that basic statistical issues have 
not been resolved, including the issues of endogeneity and non-linearities in the tests. He 
argues that the multinationality and performance literature does not take into account the 
heterogeneous nature of ﬁ rms, industries, or countries. He argues further that the multi-
nationality and performance literature needs to be much better integrated into basic inter-
national business theory and that the various “modes of multinationality” (exporting, FDI, 
outsourcing) can affect measurement. Such variations in types of multinationality are con-
sistent with the observations of Rugman (2005) on the regional nature of multinational 
activity. A related criticism of the lack of theoretical underpinnings in the multinationality 
and performance literature has been advanced by Verbeke, Li, and Goerzen (2009). It is 
clear that much more effort needs to be put into the development of appropriate theoret-
ical frameworks to model the observed empirical relationship between multinationality 
and performance. 
 Bausch et al. (2007) conduct a meta-analysis of a large set of previously published 
studies in the literature on multinationality and performance. They confirm a positive 
relationship between multinationality and performance. They have a broad definition of 
multinationality and include the traditional type of merger and acquisition (leading to 
wholly owned subsidiaries through the process of FDI) along with the non-traditional 
type of alliance formation. This leads them to invent yet another term for multinationality, 
namely international business combinations. It is unusual to include alliances in this type 
of work since it is difficult to assess the impact of alliances on firm performance in a direct 
manner, as can be done with the merger and acquisition mode of multinationality. Some 
challenging ideas are presented in this paper which attempts to extend the field of study by 
adding the alliance as an additional unit of analysis. It is particularly important to extend 
these tests to fully address the regional significance of different types of international busi-
ness combinations. 
 Fortanier et al. (2007) offer a cautionary tale for researchers on multinationality and 
performance. They find that the empirical results testing this relationship are strongly 
affected by moderating variables. In particular the so-called “strategic fit” affects perform-
ance in a significant and positive manner. Strategic fit moderates the basic aspects of 
multinationality and performance including the shape, size, and direction of the relation-
ship. Strategic fit is based upon the integration and national responsiveness framework, 
which is also used by Li and Li (2007). Fortanier and her coauthors (2007) collect archival

data on the chain of ownership of multiple subsidiaries that allow them to conduct more 
robust econometric analysis on aspects of integration and responsiveness. They have data 
for 336 of the world’s largest 500 firms for the year 2002. These variables enter as moder-
ators when testing the basic relationship between multinationality and performance. The 
results indicate a significant positive relationship between multinationality and return on 
sales, but this relationship is not a stable one since the strategic fit varies by firm. In other 
words, firms with an integration strategy perform well internationally in industries which 
are integrated. In contrast, in multidomestic industries only firms with a national respon-
siveness strategy do well internationally, so industry effects matter, as also found by Li and 
Li (2007). While the paper is interesting because it attempts to introduce organizational 
structure and strategy issues more explicitly into the literature on multinationality and 
performance, the regional dimension is not explored. 
 Kumar and Gaur (2007) examine the relationship between multinationality and per-
formance within the context of 240 of India’s MNEs, many of which are smaller firms 
than the world’s largest 500 for which the regional effect has been tested. They find strong 
evidence of a positive J-shaped exponentially increasing relationship between the inter-
nationalization of Indian firms and their performance. They also find that India’s outward 
FDI differs between developing and developed economies and between manufacturing and 
service sectors. A key contribution is that their data include relatively small and medium-
sized firms, not just the world’s largest 500 firms. This helps us better understand the 
country context in studies of multinationality and performance, as India has many small 
multinational firms. Usually size of firms is a moderating or control variable, but Kumar 
and Gaur link it to a country factor for India. 
 Nachum and Wymbs (2007) offer an interesting contrast to the literature as their geo-
graphic unit of analysis is the city. This is a subnational unit of analysis, and it can be con-
trasted with the triad regions developed in Rugman (2005). A very good reason is given for 
choosing cities—namely, that the data tested relate to the financial and professional service 
industries. These are clustered in the world’s major cities. The authors analyze 673 MNEs 
in these service sectors that entered New York and London through mergers and acqui-
sitions. They find an interaction between geographic location and the FSAs of these MNEs. 
It is a useful idea to apply the location decision for an industry and firm at the appropriate 
geographic level. These findings can be usefully contrasted with other papers where regions 
cross national borders, rather than being subnational.  
  Regional aspects of multinationality and performance 
 Li and Li (2007) provide an innovative test of the regional aspects of multinationality and 
performance. The authors use the well-known integration and responsiveness matrix to 
distinguish between a “global” industry, which has a high degree of economic integration, 
and a “multidomestic” industry, which is nationally responsive. They choose the computer 
and ofﬁ ce equipment industry as an example of a global industry, and the soap, cleanser, 
and toilet goods industry as an example of a multidomestic industry. They ﬁ nd signiﬁ -
cant differences between the two industries in terms of international strategies, which lead 
to conﬁ rmation of the regional dimension in multinational operations. They also test the 
impact of FSAs in the two industries in terms of both R&D and marketing intensity. Their 
results indicate that FSAs are largely non-location bound in the global industry, but much 
home-region bound in the multidomestic industry. In addition, they show that inter-
nationalization pace has a direct positive impact on ﬁ rm performance in the global industry 
but not in the multidomestic industry. 
 Rugman et al. (2007) introduce a new dependent variable called return on foreign assets 
(ROFA). They contrast it with the traditional variable, return on total assets (ROTA). They 
also introduce a regional variable representing regional sales. They test the explanatory 

237
CHAPTER 7 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS
power of the regional sales variable with linear, quadratic, and cubic fits. They find that the 
regional variable explains ROTA in terms of the cubic fit, but not ROFA. These data are 
focused upon a set of 27 UK multinationals of which 8 are in manufacturing and 19 are in 
service sectors; the regional variable represents sales in the EU. The results indicate that the 
27 large UK MNEs experience strong intra-regional sales and that the regional sales vari-
able is a significant variable affecting firm performance in a positive but non-linear manner 
allowing for standard control variables. 
 In a related chapter Sukpanich (2007) also includes an independent variable represent-
ing intra-regional sales, this time across MNEs in the triad regions of North America and 
the EU. She has data on 91 firms of which 67 are from North America and 24 from Europe. 
Of the 91 firms, 66 are in manufacturing and 25 in services. She uses the COMPUSTAT 
database to access data on the FSAs of MNEs. These FSAs include R&D and marketing 
 variables. She finds a strong positive linear relationship between the measure of intra-
regional sales and performance. Performance is higher for firms based in their home 
region. This result contrasts with that of Chen as discussed next. 
 Chen (2007) conducts a test of the multinationality and performance relationship across 
some service sector firms in an Asian context. He distinguishes between intra-regional sales 
and extra-regional sales for this set of service sector firms. He uses the same Osiris database 
as in Rugman et al. (2007). He does not find support for the hypothesis that intra-regional 
sales are a significant determinant of performance where performance is measured by 
return on total assets. Instead, he finds that extra-regional sales are significant, in contrast 
to Sukpanich (2007). To some extent this may support some findings by Osegowitsch and 
Sammartino (2007). Further research is required, but it is encouraging to see this focus on 
the Asian firms missing from Osegowitsch and Sammartino (2007). 
 Richter (2007) tests the importance of a regional sales variable across the UNCTAD 
set of the world’s 100 largest firms as ranked by foreign assets. This is a somewhat unrep-
resentative sample as it consists of the world’s most internationalized firms and is thus 
biased toward finding internationalization (and therefore regionalization). Richter uses the 
 S  curve and finds a significant cubic fit between performance and multinationality where 
the latter is measured by the UNCTAD transnationality index. When testing the foreign 
intra-regional sales variable, her results are ambiguous with either an S curve or inverted 
U curve being supported. However, as with other recent papers, she finds that this regional 
sales variable is a significant determinant of performance. 
 It would be useful to extend this type of research beyond the largest 100 firms (or the 
500 largest in Rugman (2005)) to include many more MNEs that are small to medium 
sized. Indeed, it would be useful to test the regional dimension in the emerging literature 
on international entrepreneurship, some of which is focused upon the internationalization 
process of small and medium-sized firms. This will require some theoretical adjustments 
to the assumption that many of these firms are “born global.” This literature seems to 
find relatively fast internationalization of small firms in the information technology and 
computer sector, but there has not been careful testing of the regional aspects of such inter-
nationalization, and other sectors need to be added. Furthermore, the normal metric used 
is a scope variable dealing with the opening of foreign subsidiaries, whereas a better metric 
is to use the ratio of foreign to total sales (in this case, regional to total sales). 
 While this work on international entrepreneurship remains to be undertaken, this 
recent empirical work provides a very useful starting point in bringing the regional nature 
of MNEs into the literature on multinationality and performance. There is uniformity in 
showing that the basic relationship between multinationality and performance is beset by 
issues of heterogeneity across countries, industries, and firms. Yet many of them also show 
that the regional nature of multinationality can be included in this work in a useful man-
ner. Therefore, the regional dimension of strategy needs to be considered in future work 
analyzing the relationship between multinationality and performance.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Multinational enterprises are businesses that are headquartered 
in one country but have operations in other countries. In such a 
complex environment, it is particularly important for these MNEs 
to have well-formulated strategic plans. Large MNEs do this by 
conducting a thorough analysis of their environments and often 
developing detailed, comprehensive plans for coordinating worldwide 
activities. These plans set forth objectives for all major divisions and 
units and provide for systematic follow-up and evaluation. Smaller 
MNEs may use less sophisticated plans. However, all multinationals 
that conduct strategic planning go through a three-step process: 
formulation, implementation, and control. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Define  the term  strategic planning  and discuss the strategic 
orientations that affect this planning process.  
 2  Explain  how strategy is formulated, giving particular emphasis to 
external and internal environmental assessment.  
 3  Describe  how strategy is implemented, with particular attention to 
location, ownership decisions, and functional area implementation.  
 4  Discuss  the ways in which MNEs control and evaluate their 
strategies.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Vodafone had its beginnings in 1982, when the Racal 
Electronics Group Board successfully bid for a private-
sector UK cellular license. The Racal Telecomms Division 
was established with 50 employees in the rural town 
of Newbury and launched the first cellular network on 
January 1, 1985. By the end of that year, Vodafone had 
19,000 subscribers. For the year ended in March 30, 
2010, London-based Vodafone was the world’s second-
largest mobile phone company measured by revenue of 
$70.8994 billion, of which 67 percent originated from Western 
Europe, and it had a workforce of 84,990 employees. (China 
Mobile Communications with revenue of $71.749 billion 
was the world’s largest mobile phone company according 
to Fortune Global 500, 2010 ranking.) As of September 30, 
2010, it had approximately 332 million mobile customers 
around the world. It operates network in over 30 countries 
and has partner network in over 40 countries. Let’s review 
its growth. 
 Vodafone expanded globally through a carefully crafted 
“triad” strategy. From 1991 to 1998 its focus was on 
Europe, where it developed one of the basic ideas that 
it continues to use in most cases—acquire companies 
in association with partners and pay for it with equity. 
This strategy has given Vodafone access to new markets 
while providing it with partners that help deal with local 
regulatory environment agencies and provide assistance 
in addressing local market needs. For example, in the case 
of Libertel of the Netherlands, Vodafone purchased 70 per-
cent of the company while Dutch ING, the local partner, 
held the rest. The company had interests in companies 
across most European markets with over 50 percent of the 
shares in many of these companies. As of September 30, 
2010, Vodafone had 124 million customers in Europe. In 
geographic terms, 37 percent of Vodafone’s subscribers 
and 64 percent of its turnover were in Western Europe. 
 To appease EU regulators during its acquisition spree in 
the 1990s, Vodafone had to divest itself of Orange, the UK’s 
third-largest wireless operator. European acquisitions 
could not, therefore, be the company’s only growth strat-
egy. Rather, the best strategy was to go international, gain 
market share in all major economies, then link together 
all these firms into a worldwide network. This is precisely 
what it did. 
 In June 1999, Vodafone took a major step in implement-
ing its worldwide strategy when it beat out Bell Atlantic 
for Airtouch Communications, a California-based firm. 
Creating Vodafone Airtouch (VA) gave the overall company 
a market capitalization of $154 billion and a total of 35 mil-
lion wireless customers worldwide. Soon after the acquisi-
tion, VA entered into an agreement with Bell Atlantic (which 
was soon to merge with GTE) that gave it a 45 percent stake 
in a venture called Verizon Wireless. This decision had 
proved to be a very good one; prior to the merger of Cingular 
and AT&T Wireless in 2004, Verizon was the largest US 
mobile telephone operator. Indeed, Cingular snatched 
AT&T Wireless from Vodafone, which was seeking to fur-
ther cement its presence in the United States through a 
controlling interest in the company.     
 By 2001 the US market had relatively low penetration 
levels compared to Europe and Japan. Yet it has the high-
est potential for growth across industrialized countries. As 
of September 30, 2010, Vodafone share in Verizon Mobile 
had 41.927 million subscribers compared to 38.9 million 
subscribers in 2001, a growth of 8 percent over 10 years. 
 Vodafone cemented its position in Japan in late 2001 
by increasing its share of Japan Telecom to 69.7 percent. 
That decision completed the firm’s “triad” strategy. By 
2001, Vodafone had 10.4 million subscribers in Japan—
7.8 percent of the company’s total subscribers. Yet on 
March 17, 2006, Vodafone announced an agreement to 
sell all its interest in Vodafone Japan to Softbank for 
£8.9 billion, of which £6.8 billion was received in cash 
on closing of the deal. Vodafone Japan later changed its 
name to Softbank Mobile. In November 2010, Vadafone 
sold its remaining minority interest in its Japanese 
operations to current owner Softbank for £3.1 billion and 
exited Japan, as part of its new strategy, “offloading non

CHAPTER 8 MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
core assets.” Vodafone said it would focus on markets in 
Europe, India, and Africa. 
 To summarize, Vodafone was a major player in the EU 
with holdings in Omnitel, Mannesmann, and SFR. The 
company was a force in the US market through its minority 
holding in Verizon Wireless. And in Asia, where the largest 
market for mobile phones is in Japan, Vodafone held oper-
ating control of Japan Telecom and also owned J-Phone, a 
large mobile phone operator. However, Vodafone eventually 
divested its investment in Japan. 
 By 2010, Vodafone had carefully ventured into other mar-
kets. In Australia and New Zealand, it had wholly owned 
subsidiaries and about 6.024 million subscribers. This 
represented 50 percent growth if compared to 4 million sub-
scribers in 2001. In non-industrialized countries, where the 
risk is higher, it held minority interests in most of its oper-
ations. Only in Egypt did it have more than 50 percent own-
ership. In South Africa, Kenya, and Fiji, it held between 35 
and 40 percent. In China, the market with the largest poten-
tial growth, it held a mere 3.2 percent ownership of the ven-
ture in 2000. In such a huge market, however, that accounted 
for nearly 5 million subscribers. In September 2010, Vodafone 
sold its stake in China’s biggest operator, China Mobile, 
for $6.5 billion for cash, and achieved  a near doubling of 
Vodafone’s original investment. Vodafone continues to coop-
erate with China’s leading telecommunication companies 
in areas such as roaming, network roadmap development, 
multinational customers, and green technology. 
 On February 11, 2007, the Company agreed to acquire 
a controlling interest of 67 percent in Hutchison Essar 
Limited in India for US$11.1 billion. At the same time, it 
agreed to sell back 5.6 percent of its AirTel stake back to 
the Mittals. Vodafone would retain a 4.4 percent stake in 
Airtel. On September 21, 2007, Hutchison was rebranded 
to Vadafone in India. However, Vodafone has ongoing 
problems with the Indian tax authority who claimed that 
Vodafone owed value added tax (VAT) on the purchase in 
2007 of the Indian telephone assets of the Hong Kong’s 
Hutchison Whampoa. Vadafone decided not to set up 
provisions for this disputed £1.6bn tax bill in India in its 
financial statements. As at September 30, 2010, Vadafone 
had 115.553 million mobile customers in India. 
 Vodafone’s strategy is to maximize its footprint with a 
common technology and offer the largest possible “roam-
ing” wireless capability, which lends itself to overall lower 
costs. Perhaps surprisingly, this roaming technology was 
more prevalent in Europe than in the United States, mostly 
due to EU-wide cooperation between governmental regu-
latory authorities regarding common platforms. 
 Vodafone is not only relying on geographic diversification 
of acquisitions. Technology plays a major role in this indus-
try, and Vodafone, like its competitors, purchased licenses 
to operate 3G technology. When the industry overestimated 
the pace at which the technology was developed, some 
providers stumbled badly, but this technology is now avail-
able in urban areas in Europe and Japan and is expanding 
quickly. Mobile telephones with video and picture tech-
nology are more established in the market, but it is data 
transfers that mobile service providers are counting on 
for increased profits. This new technology is expected to 
reduce overall costs and, competition permitting, might 
allow Vodafone to increase its revenue per subscriber. 
 The biggest challenge facing Vodafone will be that of 
coordinating all of its worldwide holdings so as to maxi-
mize shareholder value. In an effort to handle this problem, 
the company’s head office has now abandoned the use of 
centralized control and opted for a decentralized type of 
operation. In the United States, for example, local partners 
and operating managers now make many of the major 
decisions regarding how to do business. The same is true 
in Europe. Vodafone is realizing that in order to manage 
all of these different units in worldwide markets where 
regulations and customer preferences are often quite dif-
ferent, the best approach is to create a strategic plan that 
recognizes and takes advantages of these differences.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 In this chapter we provide an introduction to the key concepts of strategic management 
relevant to both MNEs and small and medium enterprises. We will review the rationale for 
strategic planning and the strategic orientation of ﬁ rms (whether they are ethnocentric, 
polycentric, regiocentric, or geocentric). We will examine the process of strategy formu-
lation and review the ﬁ ve forces of industry competitiveness. We then apply this thinking to 
analysis of a ﬁ rm’s value chain. We consider the basic generic strategies of ﬁ rms. We apply 
these concepts to the implementation of strategy and discuss how this applies to different 
modes of entry, such as wholly owned subsidiaries, strategic alliances, and joint ventures. 
We will conclude with a section on the valuation of ﬁ rm strategy and set the stage for dis-
cussion of relevant organization structures in  Chapter 9 . 
 Before becoming immersed in these details of strategic management, you should be 
aware of the linkages of strategy and structure to the previous work in this textbook 
discussing the theory of the MNE. In particular, the firm and country framework of 
 Chapter 2  can be used to illustrate the special nature of strategic management as it applies 
to MNEs. In the FSA and CSA matrix of  Chapter 2  it is useful to review cells 1 and 4 at 
this juncture. 
 Cell 1 is a situation with low FSAs but strong CSAs. In terms of strategic management 
the firm will build competitive advantages due to its home-country CSAs. For example, 
firms from Canada will build CSAs based upon natural resources. They will exploit CSAs 
in the forest products sector, in minerals, and in cheap hydroelectric power. Firms from 
China will develop CSAs in manufacturing based upon cheap labor. Firms from India 
will develop CSA in information technology based upon cheap skilled labor. Firms in the 
United States will develop economies of scale based upon the CSA of its huge domestic 
market: such CSAs (in terms of scale economies) can then be exploited abroad. The chal-
lenge for MNEs is to combine the CSAs with strong FSAs, a situation in cell 3 of the FSA–
CSA matrix of  Chapter 2 . This chapter explores ways in which strategic management itself 
may be a type of FSA that can turn the CSAs of cell 1 into the combined country and firm 
advantages of cell 3. 
 In contrast, cell 4 of the FSA–CSA matrix is a situation of strong FSAs where these are 
independent of CSAs. This cell can best be described by the resource-based view (RBV) of 
strategy. The RBV is the basic theory of strategic management as explained in textbooks by 
Barney (2007), Grant (2008), Peng (2006), and Mintzberg et al. (1998). (These references 
are in the bibliography at the end of the chapter.) The core concept in the RBV is that a 
firm needs to develop a sustainable long-run competitive advantage, or capability. This is 
often called the core competence of the firm. In terms of international business the core 
competence is identical to the concept of an FSA as discussed in  Chapter 2 . In other words, 
the RBV is simply a more detailed examination of the nature, extent, and strength of FSAs. 
The weakness of the pure RBV is that it is confined to cell 4 of the FSA–CSA matrix. In 
other words, it has no international component since CSAs are not relevant to a firm’s 
success in cell 4. 
 Obviously, cell 3 of the FSA–CSA matrix of  Chapter 2  is a most intriguing one. This is 
where country and firm effects are combined. Such complementary assets lie at the heart 
of the modern theory of the MNE in particular and international business in general. 
Cell 3 is a situation requiring the integration of firm and country advantages in a sustain-
able and long-run manner. In terms of the RBV, cell 3 is a situation requiring dynamic 
capabilities. In terms of mode of entry theory, it is a situation where network analysis can 
be applied to explain the generation of FSAs by subsidiaries within the network of the 
MNE. Some cell 3 thinking can also be applied to analyze international joint ventures. 
 INTRODUCTION

CHAPTER 8 MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
But before proceeding to this depth of analysis, it is first necessary to review the basic 
issues of strategic management (in this chapter) and organization structure (in the fol-
lowing chapter). We will return to aspects of the RBV and the nature of location-bound 
or non-location-bound FSAs in  Chapter 10  when we introduce the concept of national 
responsiveness. 
 Strategic planning   is the process of evaluating an enterprise’s environment and 
internal strengths, identifying its basic mission and long- and short-range objectives, and 
implementing a plan of action for attaining these goals. MNEs rely heavily on this process 
because it provides them with both general direction and specific guidance in carrying 
out their activities. Without a strategic plan, these businesses would have great difficulty 
in planning, implementing, and evaluating operations. With strategic planning, however, 
research shows that many MNEs have been able to make adjustments in their approach 
to dealing with competitive situations and either redirect their efforts or exploit new areas 
of opportunity. For example, as a result of losing market share in Europe in recent years, 
General Motors cut its European capacity in an effort to stem further losses.       1 Meanwhile, 
Dell Computer expanded its international presence. In 2001 the company became the 
largest firm in the worldwide PC business, with a market share of 13 percent. On a dif-
ferent front, General Electric’s strategy is to continue growing in spite of the European 
Commission’s refusal to allow it to merge with Honeywell. GE Medical bought Data 
Critical, a maker of wireless and Internet systems for communicating health-care data; GE 
Industrial Systems acquired the Lentronics line of multiplexers from Nortel Networks; and 
GE Capital purchased Heller Financial, a company in the commercial financing, equip-
ment leasing, and real estate finance business.       2  By carefully formulating their strategic 
plans, these MNEs are finding that they can better cope with the ever-changing challenge 
of worldwide competition. 3   
 Strategic planning 
  The process of evaluating 
the enterprise’s 
environment and its 
internal strengths and then 
identifying long- and short-
range activities 
 Before examining the strategic planning process, we must realize that MNEs have stra-
tegic predispositions toward doing things in a particular way, which help determine the 
speciﬁ c decisions the ﬁ rm will implement. There are four such predispositions: ethno-
centric, polycentric, regiocentric, and geocentric.  Table   8.1    lists each predisposition and 
its characteristics. 
 An MNE with an   ethnocentric predisposition   will rely on the values and interests of 
the parent company in formulating and implementing the strategic plan. Primary empha-
sis will be given to profitability and the firm will try to run operations abroad the way they 
are run at home. Firms trying to sell the same product abroad that they sell at home use 
this predisposition most commonly.    
 An MNE with a   polycentric predisposition   will tailor its strategic plan to meet the 
needs of the local culture. If the firm is doing business in more than one culture, the overall 
plan will be adapted to reflect these individual needs. The basic mission of a polycentric 
MNE is to be accepted by the local culture and to blend into the country. Each subsidiary 
will decide which objectives to pursue, based on local needs. Profits will be put back into 
the country in the form of expansion and growth.   
 An MNE with a   regiocentric predisposition   will be interested in obtaining both profit 
and public acceptance (a combination of the ethnocentric and polycentric approaches) 
and will use a strategy that allows it to address both local and regional needs. The company 
will be less focused on a particular country than on a geographic region. For example, an 
MNE doing business in the EU will be interested in all the member nations.

 An MNE with a   geocentric predisposition   will view operations on a global basis. The 
largest international corporations often use this approach. They produce global products 
with local variations and staff their offices with the best people they can find, regardless 
of country of origin. Multinationals, in the true meaning of the word, have a geocentric 
predisposition. However, it is possible for an MNE to have a polycentric or regiocentric 
predisposition if the company is moderately small or limits its operations to specific cul-
tures or geographic regions. 
 The predisposition of an MNE will greatly influence its strategic planning process. For 
example, some MNEs are more interested in profit and/or growth than in developing a 
comprehensive corporate strategy that exploits their strengths.       4  Some are more interested 
in large-scale manufacturing that will allow them to compete on a price basis across the 
country or region, as opposed to developing a high degree of responsiveness to local demand 
and tailoring a product to these specific market niches.       5  Some prefer to sell in countries 
where the cultures are similar to their own so that the same basic marketing  orientation 
can be used throughout the regions. 6  These orientations or predispositions greatly influ-
ence strategy. 7  For an example of strategic orientations, see the case  International Business

CHAPTER 8 MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
 Arthur Andersen, Accenture, and McKinsey 
 During the 1990s, some of the fastest-growing global 
organizations were professional service firms that special-
ized in areas such as consulting, accounting, publishing, 
law, public relations, advertising, and so on. Today, more 
and more of these service firms are linking together their 
worldwide country offices in order to provide seamless 
service to their multinational clients. Arthur Andersen, 
Accenture, and McKinsey & Company, three major inter-
national consulting firms, provide good examples. 
 Founded in Chicago in 1913 to provide accounting ser-
vices, Arthur Andersen had grown to over 85,000 employees 
in 84 countries by 2001. Until 1989, the firm’s management 
and technology consulting group—Andersen Consulting 
Group—had complemented its audit and accounting ser-
vices. However, in 1989, as part of a restructuring effort, 
Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting split and 
became two independent companies. The plan called for 
each to maintain its individual business and to cooperate 
under the umbrella of Andersen Worldwide. In 1997, how-
ever, Andersen Consulting sought arbitration claiming that 
Arthur Andersen had breached the agreement by expand-
ing into business consulting in technology integration, 
strategic business planning, and business transformation. 
In 2000, the arbitrator ruled in favor of Andersen Consulting 
but also forced the consulting firm to drop the Andersen 
name. Today, under the name Accenture—a combination 
of “accent” and “future”—this company is a leader in glo-
bal management and technology consulting with 204,000 
employees in 200 cities in 53 countries and a revenue of 
$21.6 billion for the year ended August 31, 2010. Its five oper-
ating groups include communications & high tech, financial 
services, health & public service, products and resources. 
Arthur Andersen, on the other hand, ceased to exist after it 
was discovered that the company, which had been Enron’s 
auditor since 1985, had been involved in the Enron scandal 
of 2001. When investigators discovered that Andersen had 
destroyed documents relating to the case, the reputation it 
had relied on was shattered and its clients departed. 
 In 1926, James O. McKinsey left his job as a University of 
Chicago accounting professor to found a company that would 
provide finance and budgeting services. Soon afterwards, 
however, McKinsey & Company came to be better known for 
providing advice on management and organizational issues. 
In the 1960s, as tariffs began to be lowered and US firms 
thought of ways to expand internationally, the McKinsey 
company provided consulting on how to expand, while 
expanding into Europe, Canada, and Australia itself. Today, 
the firm is the best-known management–consultancy 
private firm in the world, with 16,500 employees in 99 
offices in 56 countries and Forbes estimated its revenue of 
$6 billion for the year 2008. However, it has had mixed suc-
cess at running its international operations. The German 
subsidiary is relatively independent, for example, while the 
French subsidiary is not. McKinsey’s core strength is its 
brand name built on the in-house training and manage-
ment of its highly skilled people, who have been recruited 
from top business schools. In 2001, the firm found itself 
with overcapacity and had to lay off some of its most recent 
employees. Nevertheless, by 2004, it was estimated that the 
firm was using only 50 to 60 percent of its capacity. When 
the IT bubble burst, McKinsey lost many of its clients. Other 
clients, not affected by IT, were reluctant to turn to consult-
ing firms for advice due to the demise of one of McKinsey’s 
largest competitors, Arthur Andersen. Enron was headed by 
the CEO, Jeff Skilling who was McKinsey’s former partner 
in the energy and chemical consulting practices. Enron was 
one of McKinsey’s biggest clients before it collapsed. And 
Mr. Skilling himself was sentenced to 24 years in federal 
prison as he was convicted of multiple federal felony 
charges relating to Enron’s financial collapse in 2001. 
 In summary, consulting firms were originally designed 
to provide advice to managers on improving workplace 
efficiencies with the use of engineers and time and motion 
studies. But they soon began to realize that senior execu-
tives also needed advice on strategy and organization and 
began to offer it to their clients. The 1970s and 1980s saw 
the height of this type of consultancy service. In the 1990s, 
however, the rise of the IT sector meant that these firms 
themselves had to redefine their strategic focus. Today, 
consultancies offer accounting, legal, management, leader-
ship training, strategic planning, operational analysis, and 
technology services, among others. 
 Consulting firms have often been deemed recession-
proof because their services are needed regardless of 
what happens in the economy. For example, in good times, 
businesses need consulting assistance to help them deal 
with expansion, mergers, and acquisitions; in bad times, 
they need help in cutting back operations, trimming the 
workforce, and refocusing their strategy. The most recent 
worldwide economic slowdown, however, led to an unex-
pected and significant slowdown in consulting as well. In 
the 1990s, the market was growing by 20 percent annually; 
by 2001 this growth rate had shrunk to 3 percent. This slow-
down has taken its toll. In the past, consulting firms focused 
their efforts on securing long-term relationships with large 
MNEs and other large organizations. And by drawing on 
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Strategy formulation   is the process of evaluating an enterprise’s environment and internal 
strengths. This typically begins with consideration of the external arena, since the MNE will 
ﬁ rst be interested in opportunities that can be exploited. Attention is then directed to the 
internal environment and the resources the organization has available, or can develop, to 
take advantage of these opportunities.   
 External environmental assessment 
 The analysis of the external environment involves two activities: information gathering and 
information assessment. These steps help to answer two key questions: what is going on 
in the external environment; and how will these developments affect our company?       8 One 
of the most common ways to do this is through   competitive intelligence  , which is the 
use of systematic techniques for obtaining and analyzing public information about com-
petitors. These data are particularly useful in keeping MNEs alert to likely moves by the 
competition. 9   
 Information gathering 
 Information gathering is a critical phase of international strategic planning. Unfortunately, 
not all ﬁ rms recognize this early enough. In the case of Harley-Davidson, the large US-based 
motorcycle manufacturer, it was not until the Japanese began dominating the motorcycle 
market that Harley realized its problem. A systematic analysis of the competition revealed 
that the major reason for Japanese success in the US market was the high quality of their 
products, a result of extremely efﬁ cient manufacturing techniques. Today, Harley is com-
petitive again. It achieved renewed success because it rethought its basic business, reformu-
lated company strategy, vastly improved product quality, and rededicated itself to its core 
business: heavyweight motorcycles. 
 There are a number of ways that MNEs conduct an environmental scan and forecast the 
future. Four of the most common methods include: (1) asking industry experts to discuss 
industry trends and make projections about the future; (2) using historical industry trends 
to forecast future developments; (3) asking knowledgeable managers to write scenarios 
describing what they foresee for the industry over the next two to three years; and (4) using 
computers to simulate the industry environment and generate likely future developments. Of 
these, expert opinion is the most commonly used.       10  The Japanese and the South Koreans 
provide excellent examples. Mitsubishi has more than 700 employees in New York City, 
where its primary objective is to gather information on US competitors and markets. All 
large Japanese corporations operating in the United States employ similar strategies. The

get costs under control. Some critics have wondered aloud 
why they are having so many problems. If they are indeed 
experts at helping organizations solve the challenges asso-
ciated with economic downturns, why do they not simply 
apply some of these solutions to their own current situation?

CHAPTER 8 MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
same is true for large South Korean trading firms, which require their branch managers to 
send back information on market developments. These data are then analyzed and used to 
help formulate future strategies for the firms. 
 Such information helps MNEs to identify competitor strengths and weaknesses and to 
target areas for attack. This approach is particularly important when a company is deliver-
ing a product or service for many market niches around the world that are too small to 
be individually profitable. In such situations the MNE has to identify a series of different 
niches and attempt to market successfully in each of these geographic areas.       11  The infor-
mation is also critical to those firms that will be coming under attack. 
 Information assessment 
 Having gathered information on the competition and the industry, MNEs then evaluate 
the data. One of the most common approaches is to make an overall assessment based on 
the ﬁ ve forces that determine industry competitiveness: buyers, suppliers, potential new 
entrants to the industry, the availability of substitute goods and services, and rivalry among 
the competitors.  Figure  8.1 shows the connections among these forces. 12 
 Bargaining power of buyers 
 MNEs examine the power of their buyers in order to predict the likelihood of maintaining 
these customers. If the ﬁ rm believes buyers may be moving their business to competitors, 
the MNE will want to formulate a strategy for countering this move. For example, the 
company may offer a lower price or increase the amount of service it provides.  
 Bargaining power of suppliers 
 An MNE looks at the power of the industry’s suppliers to see if it can gain a competitive 
advantage here. 13  For example, if there are a number of suppliers in the industry, the MNE 
may attempt to play them off against one another in an effort to get a lower price. Or the 
company may move to eliminate any threat from the suppliers by acquiring one of them, 
thus guaranteeing itself a ready source of inputs.

Rivalry of

252
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 New entrants 
 The company will examine the likelihood of new ﬁ rms entering the industry and will try 
to determine the impact they might have on the MNE. Two typical ways that international 
MNEs attempt to reduce the threat of new entrants are by (1) keeping costs low and con-
sumer loyalty high, and (2) encouraging the government to limit foreign business activity 
through regulation such as duties, tariffs, quotas, and other protective measures.  
 Threat of substitutes 
 The MNE looks at the availability of substitute goods and services and tries to anticipate 
when such offerings will reach the market. There are a number of steps the company can 
take to offset this competitive force, including (1) lowering prices, (2) offering similar 
products, and (3) increasing services to the customer. 
 Rivalry 
 The MNE examines the rivalry that exists between itself and the competition and seeks 
to anticipate future changes in this arrangement. Common strategies for maintaining and/or 
increasing market strength include (1) offering new goods and services, (2) increasing 
 productivity and thus reducing overall costs, (3) working to differentiate current goods and 
services from those of the competition, (4) increasing overall quality of goods and services, 
and (5) targeting speciﬁ c niches with a well-designed market strategy. 
 As the MNE examines each of these five forces, it must decide the attractiveness and 
unattractiveness of each. This will help decide how and where to make strategic changes. 
 Figure  8.2 shows the five-forces model applied to the semiconductor industry. 
 Notice in  Figure   8.2    that at the time this analysis was conducted, the suppliers in 
the semiconductor industry were not very powerful, so they were an attractive force for 
the MNE. Buyers did not have many substitute products from which to choose (an

CHAPTER 8 MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
attractive development), but there was some backward integration toward purchasing their 
own sources of supply (an unattractive development). Overall, the attractiveness of buyer 
power was regarded as inconclusive. The third force, entry barriers, was quite attractive 
because of the high costs of getting into the industry and the short product life cycles that 
existed there. It was very difficult for a company to enter this market. The fourth force, 
substitutes, was unattractive because new products were being developed continually and 
customer loyalty was somewhat low. The fifth and final force, industry rivalry, was also 
unattractive because of the high cost of doing business, the cyclical nature of sales, and the 
difficulty of differentiating one’s products from those of the competition.  
 On an overall basis, however, the industry was classified as attractive. It also appeared 
that the industry would see consolidation of smaller firms into larger firms that would have 
greater resources to commit to research and development. 
 MNEs operating in the semiconductor industry would use this analysis to help them 
increase the attractiveness of those forces that currently are not highly attractive. For example, 
they could work to develop state-of-the-art semiconductors that might be substituted for 
the competition’s products, and they would attempt to maintain a technological advantage 
so that the substitute force would not become a problem for them. In the process, they 
would likely be better able to increase their power over the buyers since their products 
would be so high-tech that the customers could not do better by purchasing from a com-
petitor. In summary, environmental assessment, such as that provided by an analysis of 
competitive forces, is used to determine MNE opportunities and threats and help identify 
strategies for improving market position and profitability.

 Given the competitiveness of the environment, how much opportunity exists 
for Vodafone in the international mobile phone market? 
 As seen from the case data, the international opportunities in this industry are great. One 
reason is because the market is going to continue growing and updating itself with new 
technology that may allow Vodafone to increase its revenue per subscriber and carve itself 
a larger portion of the market. The number of mobile phone users in the United States 
will increase sharply during this decade, and new technology will allow for expansion in 
all three triad markets. The key to success in this industry is to have a presence in all 
major markets, primarily the triad countries and others where the cost of mobile phones 
is within reach of the average person. China, for example, could be an important market 
because of its large population, but the market is highly competitive and favours local 
mobile companies. In 2010, Vadafone sold its 3.2 percent stake of investment to the joint 
venture partner—China Mobile. However, newly industrialized countries offer Vodafone 
more stability for its investment because the average GDP is much greater than that of 
China’s and there is less political instability. Examples include Singapore, Malaysia, and 
Taiwan. Indeed, in 2003, Mobile signed a partner network with M1, one of the largest 
mobile companies in Singapore and a similar partner network agreement with Telekom 
Malaysia in 2006. In addition, Australia and New Zealand are important target markets. 
By focusing on these more affluent markets and offering both state-of-the-art products 
and competitive prices, Vodafone has a very good chance of outdistancing the competition. 
And Vodafone has expanded its operation in Australia through purchases of retail network, 
and deployment of latest mobile technology, etc.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Internal environmental assessment 
 The internal environmental assessment helps pinpoint MNE strengths and weaknesses. 
There are two speciﬁ c areas that a multinational should examine in this assessment: 
(1) physical resources and personnel competencies; and (2) the way in which value chain analy-
sis can be used to bring these resources together in the most synergistic and proﬁ table manner. 
  Physical resources and personnel competencies 
 The physical resources are the assets that the MNE will use to carry out its strategic plan. 
Many of these are reported on the balance sheet as reﬂ ected by cash, inventory, machin-
ery, and equipment accounts. However, this does not tell the whole story. The location 
and disposition of these resources is also important. For example, an MNE with manu-
facturing plants on three continents may be in a much better position to compete world-
wide than a competitor whose plants are all located in one geographic area. Location can 
also affect cost. In the 1980s it was possible for Japanese steelmakers to sell their prod-
ucts in the United States at lower prices than their US competitors. During the 1990s US 
ﬁ rms improved their steel-producing technology and erected small minimills that were 
highly efﬁ cient, thus offsetting the location advantage of their foreign competitors. By 2000, 
European steelmakers, in particular, had sharply increased their efﬁ ciency and, along with 
Japanese ﬁ rms, were able to compete in the US market.       14  Between 1997 and 2003, 41 US 
steel ﬁ rms went bankrupt, which led the industry to lobby the US government for protec-
tion from imports. In 2002, tariffs of 8–30 percent were imposed on imports from most 
countries to help the US industry restructure.       15  These were removed in 2003, after com-
plaints by other countries to the WTO. Facing increased competition from China and other 
Asian economies, in 2007 EU Steel ﬁ rms ﬁ led a complaint with the European Commission, 
seeking duties to be placed on goods imported from China, Taiwan, and South Korea. The 
European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer) said the EU market had 
been “inundated” by imports. As a result EU prices had been undercut “by up to 25%” and 
threatened thousands of jobs. Steel from China to the EU was expected to double in 2007 
from a year earlier, to 10 million tons. 
 Another important consideration is the degree of integration that exists within the oper-
ating units of the MNE. Large companies, in particular, tend to be divided into   strategic 
business units (SBUs)  . These are operating units with their own strategic space that pro-
duce and sell goods and services to a market segment and have a well-defined set of com-
petitors. 16  SBUs are sometimes referred to as “businesses within the business.” Mitsubishi, 
the giant Japanese conglomerate, has a host of SBUs that constitute its corporate network, 
including steelmaking, auto production, electronics, and banking. So when a Mitsubishi 
SBU that manufactures and sells consumer goods is looking for help with financing, it 
can turn to the banking SBU. If the bank finds that a customer needs a firm to produce a 
particular electronics product, it can refer the buyer to the electronics SBU.   
 In fact, some large MNEs use   vertical integration  , which is the ownership of all assets 
needed to produce the goods and services delivered to the customer. Many large Japanese 
manufacturing firms, in particular, have moved toward vertical integration by purchas-
ing controlling interests in their suppliers.       17  The objective is to obtain control over the 
supply and thus ensure that the materials or goods are delivered as needed. Many US and 
European firms have shied away from this strategy because “captured suppliers” are often 
less cost effective than independents. For example, a number of years ago  Time magazine 
owned the forests for producing the paper it needed. However, the company eventually 
sold this resource because it found that the cost of making the paper was higher than that 
charged by large paper manufacturers that specialized in this product. So vertical inte-
gration may reduce costs in some instances, but it can be an ineffective strategy in others.       18 
A particular problem with vertical integration is defending oneself from competitors which

are less vertically integrated and are able to achieve cost efficiencies as a result. The latter 
rely heavily on outsourcers and employ   virtual integration  , which is the ownership of the 
core technologies and manufacturing capabilities needed to produce outputs coupled with 
dependence on outsourcers to provide all other needed inputs. Virtual integration allows 
an MNE to operate as if it were vertically integrated, but it does not require the company 
to own all the factors of production, as is the case with vertically integrated firms.    
 Personnel competencies are the abilities and talents of the people. An MNE should 
examine these because they reflect many of the company’s strengths and weaknesses. For 
example, if an MNE has an outstanding R&D department, it may be able to develop high-
quality, state-of-the-art products. However, if the company has no sales arm, it will sell the 
output to a firm that can handle the marketing and distribution. Conversely, if a company 
lacks a strong R&D department but has an international sales force, it may allow the com-
petition to bring out new products and to rely on its own R&D people to reverse-engineer 
them—that is, to find out how they are built and develop technologies that can do the same 
thing—while relying on the sales force to build market share. This strategy has been used 
by many internationally based personal computer (PC) firms that have taken PC technol-
ogy and used it to develop similar but far less expensive units that are now beginning to 
dominate the world market. 
 An understanding of what a company does well can help it decide whether the best 
strategy is to lead or to follow close behind and copy the leader. Not every MNE has the 
personnel competencies to be first in the field, and many are happy to follow because the 
investment risk is less and the opportunity for profit is often good.  
 Value chain analysis 
 A complementary approach to internal environment assessment is an examination of the 
ﬁ rm’s value chain. 19 A  value chain   is the way in which primary and support activities are 
combined to provide goods and services and increase proﬁ t margins.  Figure  8.3 provides the 
general schema of a value chain. The primary activities in this chain include: (1) inbound 
logistics, such as receiving, storing, materials handling, and warehouse activities; (2) oper-
ations, in which inputs are put into ﬁ nal product form by performing activities such as 
machining, assembling, testing, and packaging; (3) outbound logistics, which involve dis-
tributing the ﬁ nished product to the customer; (4) marketing and sales, which are used to 
encourage buyers to purchase the product; and (5) service for maintaining and enhancing 
the value of the product after the sale through activities such as repair, product adjustment,

training, and parts supply. The support activities in the value chain consist of: (1) the ﬁ rm’s 
infrastructure, which is made up of the company’s general management, planning, ﬁ nance, 
accounting, legal, government affairs, and quality management areas; (2) human resource 
management, which is made up of the selection, placement, appraisal, promotion, training, 
and development of the ﬁ rm’s personnel; (3) technology in the form of knowledge, research 
and development, and procedures that can result in improved goods and services; and 
(4) procurement, which involves the purchasing of raw materials, supplies, and similar goods.     
 MNEs can use these primary and support activities to increase the value of the goods 
and services they provide. As such, they form a value chain. Any firm can apply this idea 
of a value chain. For example, Makita of Japan has become a leading competitor in power 
tools for professional users worldwide because it was the first to use new, less expensive 
materials for making tool parts and to produce in standardized models. As of March 31, 
2010, the company had nine production bases, two located in each of Japan and China, 
and one each in the United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Romania. 
It then sold worldwide. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, approximately 
77 percent of Makita’s sales were outside of Japan, most of them made to professional users 
worldwide, including those engaged in timber and metal processing, carpentry, forestry, 
and concrete and masonry works. During fiscal 2010, Makita’s primary products were 
power tools such as drills, rotary hammers, hammer drills, demolition hammers, grinders, 
and cordless impact drivers. Sales of these products accounted for more than 70 percent 
of Makita’s total net sales. 
 Analysis of the value chain can also help a company determine the type of strategy that 
will be most effective. In all, there are three generic strategies: cost, differentiation, and focus. 
 1  Cost strategy   relies on such approaches as aggressive construction of efficient facilities, 
vigorous pursuit of cost reductions and overhead control, avoidance of marginal cus-
tomer accounts, and cost minimization in areas like R&D, service, sales, and advertising.  
 2  Differentiation strategy   is directed toward creating something that is perceived 
as being unique. Approaches to differentiation can take many forms, including the 
creation of design or brand image, improved technology or features, and increased 
customer service or dealer networks.  
 3  Focus strategy   involves concentrating on a particular buyer group and segmenting 
that niche based on product line or geographic market. While low-cost and differen-
tiation strategies are aimed at achieving objectives industrywide, a focus strategy is built 
around servicing a particular target market, and each functional policy is developed 
with this in mind. 20    
 In addition, the ﬁ rm will determine its   competitive scope  , which is the breadth of its target 
market within the industry.  Figure  8.4 provides an example of these generic strategies as 
applied to the worldwide ship building industry.    
 The value chain can help an MNE create synergies within the organization’s activities. 
For example, by combining the human resource talent of their salespeople with the exper-
tise of their design and styling personnel, firms like PSA Peugeot-Citroën and Volkswagen 
have been able to increase their auto market share in Western Europe in recent years.       21 
In particular, Peugeot and VW have been able to cut costs and offer a wide range of new 
models. Their overall success is found in their ability to manage the flow of new products, 
so that the offerings remain reasonably fresh without spending money on excessive invest-
ment in updates or redesign. Firms that cannot get this aspect of the product cycle correct 
have been falling behind in the European market, as seen by Ford, General Motors, and, 
most significantly, Renault. 22  Simply put, by analyzing the ways of combining their pri-
mary and support activities, some automotive MNEs have been able to create a strategy 
that allows them to draw heavily on their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses.       23

What type of generic strategy does Vodafone employ? Defend your answer. 
 Vodafone uses a focus strategy that is geared toward identifying market niches and meet-
ing the needs of the mobile customers in these target groups. Notice that one of the guide-
lines it follows in most of its acquisitions is to be the major stakeholder (or at least hold 
a substantial ownership position) but also to have a partner which can help the company 
deal with the challenges in the local market. As the case notes, the company held over 
50 percent of the shares in most of the European countries in which it operates, plus a 
large percentage of Verizon in the United States. Another generic strategy has been to pay 
for its acquisitions through equity, which saved it from the technology crash of the early 
2000s. So the company targets selected markets in which there is little risk and provides 
innovative products at competitive prices in order to compete effectively.   
✔
 Goal setting 
 External and internal environmental analyses provide an MNE with the information needed 
for setting goals. Some of these goals will be determined during the external analysis, as the 
company identiﬁ es opportunities it wants to exploit. Others will be ﬁ nalized after the value 
chain analysis is complete. In either event, one of the outcomes of strategy formulation will 
be the identiﬁ cation of goals. 24 
 There are two basic ways of examining the goals or objectives of international business 
operations. One is to review them on the basis of operating performance or functional 
area.  Table   8.2    provides an illustration. Some of the major goals are related to profitability, 
marketing, production, finance, and human resources. A second way is to examine these 
goals by geographic area, or on an SBU basis. For example, the European group may 
have a profitability goal of 16 percent, the North American group’s profitability goal may 
be 17 percent, and the Pacific Rim group may aim for 18 percent. Then there are accom-
panying functional goals for marketing, production, and finance. If the MNE has SBUs, 
each SBU in these geographic locales will have its own list of goals. 

258
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 This approach uses what is called a “cascading effect”—like a cascade of water rippling 
down the side of a hill, it reaches the bottom by moving from one level to the next. The 
MNE starts out by setting a profitability goal for the overall enterprise. Each geographic 
area or business unit is then assigned a profitability goal that, if attained, will result in the 
MNE reaching its overall desired profitability. The same approach is used in other key 
areas such as marketing, production, and finance. Within each unit, these objectives are 
further subdivided so that every part of the organization understands its objectives and 
everyone is working toward the same overall goals.

 Strategy implementation   is the process of attaining goals by using the organization struc-
ture to execute the formulated strategy properly. There are many areas of focus in this 
process. Three of the most important are location, ownership decisions, and functional 
area implementation. The case  International Business Strategy in Action: Fuji Xerox and 
Xerox illustrates how these considerations can be used in gaining market entry. 25  
 Location 
 MNEs have greatly expanded their international presence over the past decade. Some of 
the areas in which they have begun to set up operations include China, the former Soviet 
Union, and Eastern Europe. 
 Location is important for a number of reasons. Local facilities often provide a cost 
advantage to the producer, particularly when the raw materials, parts, or labor needed 
to make the product can be inexpensively obtained close to the facility. Location is also 
important because residents may prefer locally produced goods. For example, many people 
in the United States like to “buy American.” Some locations may also be attractive because 
the local government is encouraging investment through various means such as low tax 
rates, free land, subsidized energy and transportation rates, and low-interest loans while 
subjecting imported goods to tariffs, quotas, or other governmental restrictions, thereby 
making local manufacture more desirable. Finally, the MNE may already be doing so much

business in a country that the local government will insist that it set up local operations 
and begin producing more of its goods there. This is a major reason why Japanese auto 
manufacturers began to establish operations in the United States. 
 Although the benefits can be great, a number of drawbacks are associated with locating 
operations overseas. One is an unstable political climate that can leave an MNE vulner-
able to low profits and bureaucratic red tape. In Russia, for example, the government has 
encouraged joint ventures, but because of political and economic uncertainty many busi-
ness people currently regard such investments as high-risk ventures. A second drawback is 
the possibility of revolution or armed conflict. MNEs with operations in Kuwait lost just 
about all of their investment in the Gulf War, and MNEs with locales in Saudi Arabia and 
other Middle East countries affected by the Gulf War also withstood losses in the region. 
Most recently, businesses in areas targeted by international terrorists have been making 
 Fuji Xerox and Xerox 
 Fuji Xerox was created in 1962 as a 50/50 joint venture 
between UK-based Rank Xerox and Fujifilm Holdings 
Corporation. It is regarded as the most successful partner-
ship between US and Japanese firms. The arrangement 
developed from a sales operation for Xerox products in 
Japan into a fully integrated organization with its own R&D 
and manufacturing. By 1990, Fuji Xerox revenues were 
$4 billion and the company had a world product mandate 
to supply the entire Xerox Group with the low-to-mid-
range copiers that were the core of its business. Indeed, as 
Xerox’s monopoly on large copiers began to dwindle in the 
1970s, it was its Japanese partner, Fuji Xerox, that rode to 
the rescue with its new, high-quality smaller copiers. 
 In 1975, Xerox was forced by the US Federal Trade 
Commission to license its original core copier technology 
to rivals such as IBM, Kodak, Ricoh, and Canon. If it had 
not been for Fuji Xerox developing new copier technol-
ogy, Xerox would have failed. The firm’s early monopoly in 
the world copier business was eroded sharply by intense 
rivalry from Japanese competitors such as Canon and 
Ricoh as well as from Kodak and IBM. These rivals pro-
duced higher-quality, lower-priced, more technologically 
advanced, and more reliable copiers than Xerox. 
 When Fuji Xerox recognized the threat, its managers, act-
ing autonomously, started R&D into new small copiers. The 
US head office was slow to take on board the technology 
and products of its Japanese partner. Loss of market share, 
however, especially to Canon, eventually led to ever-closer 
degrees of cooperation between Xerox and Fuji Xerox. In 
particular, the high quality standards of Fuji Xerox were 
spread throughout the Xerox Group, and its total quality 
management (TQM) techniques helped Xerox regain market. 
In this context, Xerox was helped by a partner that was the 
hotbed of TQM and copier innovation in the 1970s and 1980s. 
 One of the reasons for success in the collaboration 
between Xerox and Fuji Photo Films was that the latter 
acted as a silent partner in the 50/50 joint venture and 
allowed Fuji Xerox to develop its own management cadre, 
who became skilled in R&D and copier technology and in 
the manufacturing and marketing of small copiers. Fuji 
Xerox also transformed itself from a marketing subsidiary 
into a full-line business, thus ending up being more innova-
tive and responsive to the market than Xerox itself. 
 In 2009, Fuji Xerox had revenues totalling US $11.080 bil-
lion with 40,646 employees. For its part, Xerox’s revenues 
totalled $15.179 billion with 133,200 employees for the year 
ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended March 31, 
2010 Fujifilm Holdings Corporation reported revenue of 
US $23.5 billion (Japanese Yen 2,181.7 billion) and 74,216 
employees. Today, Fujifilm owns 75 percent of the company 
and Xerox owns the remaining 25 percent.

plans to reduce their risks. In some cases firms are finding a way to “hedge their bets,” as 
noted in the following example:  
  Some . . . opt for locales where the cost of running a small enterprise is significantly lower than 
that of running a large one. In this way they spread their risk, setting up many small locations 
throughout the world rather than one or two large ones. Manufacturing firms are a good example. 
Some production firms feel that the economies of scale associated with a large-scale plant are 
more than offset by the potential problems that can result, should economic or political difficul-
ties develop in the country. These firms’ strategy is to spread the risk by opting for a series of small 
plants spread throughout a wide geographic region. 26 
 Ownership 
 Ownership of international operations has become an important issue in recent years. 
Many Americans, for example, believe that the increase in foreign-owned businesses in the 
United States is weakening the economy. People in other countries have similar feelings 
about US businesses there. In truth, the real issue of ownership is whether or not the com-
pany is contributing to the overall economic good of the country where it is doing business. 
As one researcher noted, “because the US-owned corporation is coming to have no special 
relationship with Americans, it makes no sense for the United States to entrust its national 
competitiveness to it. The interests of American-owned corporations may or may not coin-
cide with those of the American people.” 27  Countries that want to remain economically 
strong must be able to attract international investors who will provide jobs that allow their 
workers to increase their skills and build products that are demanded on the world market. 
In accomplishing this objective, ﬁ rms often engage in strategic alliances. 
 Strategic alliance 
 Sometimes companies prefer to invest in another country and maintain 100 percent own-
ership. This, however, is often very expensive and risky. Given that the MNE may not have 
much experience in that particular marketplace, local partners may be very helpful in deal-
ing with all sorts of local barriers. As a result, it is becoming increasingly popular to ﬁ nd 
MNEs turning to the use of strategic partnerships. A   strategic alliance or partnership is 
an agreement between two or more competitive MNEs for the purpose of cooperating in 
some manner in serving a global market.       28  The type of cooperation can be in marketing, 
research, or a more comprehensive manner. In recent years these partnerships have become 
increasingly popular, 29 although careful management of such agreements continues to be 
a critical area of concern.       30  An example of a strategic partnership is that of Matsushita 
Electric Industrial and Hitachi, Japan’s two leading electronics manufacturers. These com-
panies have jointly developed state-of-the-art technology in three areas: smart cards, home 
network systems, and recyclable and energy-efﬁ cient consumer electronics. In the past, 
both ﬁ rms have developed their own products, but now they are turning to a strategic 
partnership to save money and shorten development time.       31  Another example of strategic 
partnerships is that between IBM and NTT. Under the terms of their agreement at the turn 
of the century, IBM provided outsourcing services to NTT, Japan’s dominant telecom-
munications carrier. In turn, IBM was able to use NTT Comware staff in outsourcing and 
obtaining computer service contracts with other customers in Japan.       32    
 International joint ventures 
 An  international joint venture (IJV)   is an agreement between two or more partners to 
own and control an overseas business.       33  This is a special type of a strategic alliance that 
involves setting up a new business entity, generally involving management separate from 
that of the partners’ own management teams. IJVs take a number of different forms       34 and 
offer myriad opportunities. 35  One of these reasons is government encouragement and

legislation designed to make it attractive for foreign investors to bring in local partners. A 
second reason is the growing need for partners which know the local economy, the culture, 
and the political system and which can cut through red tape in getting things done—
something IJVs often do very well. 36 Indeed, IJVs are often the result of two or more companies 
identifying the potential for “synergies,” wherein each partner brings to the venture what the 
other partner needs but is lacking in. For example, an MNE might provide a local partner 
with technology know-how and an infusion of capital that, in turn, will allow the local ﬁ rm 
to expand operations, raise market share, and begin exporting. An example is Toyota and PSA 
Peugeot-Citroën, which entered into an IJV to jointly develop and build a small, fuel-efﬁ cient 
car for the European market. The primary beneﬁ t for Toyota is the opportunity to expand its 
model line-up in Europe. The major advantage for Peugeot is that of gaining a new small car 
for its European product line while sharing the development costs with Toyota.       37    
 Unfortunately, in many cases IJVs have not worked out well. Several studies found a 
failure rate of 30 percent for ventures in developed countries and 45–50 percent in less 
developed countries.       38  The major reason has been the desire by foreign MNEs to control 
local operation, which sometimes has resulted in poor decision making and/or conflicts 
with the local partners. In general, joint ventures are difficult to manage and are frequently 
unstable. 39  This issue of joint ventures and alliances is discussed further in  Chapter 22  
under the flagship firm analysis of business networks.

 What form of ownership arrangement is Vodafone using to gain world market 
share? Explain. 
 Vodafone uses two basic approaches. The most common is the international joint venture, 
which is seen by the company’s decisions to acquire an ownership position in a local 
company but have a local partner hold the remainder of the ownership. An example is its 
minority stake in Verizon Wireless, which is now the largest US mobile telephone operator 
in America. In some cases, however, Vodafone opts for total ownership and purchases 
the entire company, usually when it believes it does not need a local partner. An example 
is Airtouch Communications, where Vodafone acquired the entire firm. In both cases, of 
course, the ownership arrangement is designed to help Vodafone continue to increase its 
market share in that geographic region.

✔
 Functional strategies 
 Functional strategies are used to coordinate operations and ensure that the plan is carried 
out properly. 40  The speciﬁ c functions that are key to the success of the MNE will vary, but 
they typically fall into six major areas: marketing, manufacturing, ﬁ nance, procurement, 
technology, and human resources. For purposes of analysis, they can be examined in terms 
of three major considerations: marketing, manufacturing, and ﬁ nance. 
 Marketing 
 The marketing strategy is designed to identify consumer needs and formulate a plan of action 
for selling the desired goods and services to these customers.       41  Most marketing strategies are 
built around what is commonly known as the “four Ps” of marketing: product, price, promo-
tion, and place. The company identiﬁ es the products that are in demand in the market niches 

262
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
it is pursuing. It apprises the manufacturing department of any modiﬁ cations needed to 
meet local needs, and it determines the price at which the goods can be sold. Then the com-
pany devotes its attention to promoting the products and selling them in the local market.  
 Manufacturing 
 Designed to ﬁ t together with the marketing plan, the manufacturing strategy ensures that 
the right products are built and delivered in time for sale. Manufacturing also coordinates 
its strategy with the procurement and technology people to ensure that the desired 
ma terials are available and the products have the necessary state-of-the-art quality. If the 
MNE is producing goods in more than one country, it gives attention to coordinating 
activities where needed. For example, some ﬁ rms manufacture goods in two or more coun-
tries, then assemble and sell them in other geographic regions. Japanese auto ﬁ rms send car 
parts to the United States for assembly and then sell some of the assembled cars in Canada, 
Mexico, and South America. Whirlpool builds appliances worldwide with operations in 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, and seven other countries. Such production and 
assembly operations have to be coordinated carefully. 42 
 Finance 
 Financial strategy often serves to both lead and lag the other functional strategies. In the 
lead position, ﬁ nance limits the amounts of money that can be spent on marketing (new 
product development, advertising, promotion) and manufacturing (machinery, equip-
ment, quality control) to ensure that the desired return on investment is achieved. In the 
lag position, the ﬁ nancial strategy is used to evaluate performance and provide insights into 
how future strategy should be changed. 
 Financial strategies used to be formulated and controlled out of the home office. In 
recent years, however, MNEs have learned that this approach can be cumbersome and, due 
to fluctuating currency prices, costly as well. Today’s overseas units have more control over 
their finances than before, but they are guided by a carefully constructed budget that is in 
accord with the overall strategic plan. They are also held to account for financial perform-
ance in the form of return on investment, profit, capital budgeting, debt financing, and 
working capital management. 
 The strategy formulation and implementation processes are subject to control and evalu-
ation. This process involves examining the MNE’s performance to determine (1) how well 
the organization has done and (2) what actions should be taken in light of this perform-
ance. This process is tied directly to the overall strategy in that the objectives serve as the 
basis for comparison and evaluation. 43  Figure  8.5 illustrates how this process works. 
 If the comparison and evaluation show that the SBU or overseas operation is perform-
ing according to expectations, then things will continue as before. The objectives may be 
altered because of changes in the strategic plan, but otherwise nothing major is likely to 
be done. On the other hand, if there have been problems, the MNE will want to identify 
the causes and work to eliminate or minimize them. 44  Similarly, if the unit has performed 
extremely well and achieved more than forecasted, management may want to reset the 
objectives to a higher level because there is obviously greater market demand than was 
believed initially. In making these decisions, the company uses a variety of measures. Some 
are highly quantitative and depend on financial and productivity performance; others 
are more qualitative and judgmental in nature. The following discussion examines six of 
the most common methods of measurement used for control and evaluation purposes.   
 CONTROL AND EVALUATION 

263
CHAPTER 8 MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
  Common methods of measurement 
 Speciﬁ c measures will vary depending on the nature of the MNE and the goals it has estab-
lished. However,   return on investment (ROI)  , which is measured by dividing net income 
before taxes by the costs of investment, is a major consideration in most cases. There are a 
number of reasons why ROI is so popular as a control and evaluation measure: (1) it is a 
single comprehensive result that is inﬂ uenced by everything that happens in the business; 
(2) it measures how well the managers in every part of the world are using the investments 
at their command; and (3) it allows a comparison of results among units in the same 
country as well as on an intercountry basis. Of course, there are shortcomings as well: 
(1) if one unit is selling goods to another unit, the ROI of the former is being artiﬁ cially 
inﬂ ated; (2) the ROI in a growing market will be higher than that in markets that are just 
getting off the ground or are maturing, so that a comparison of the ROI performance 
between units can be misleading; and (3) the ROI is a short-term measure of perform-
ance that, if relied on too heavily, will not help managers develop the necessary long-term 
time horizons. Despite these shortcomings, however, ROI remains a major measure of 
performance.  
 Another measure is sales growth and/or market share. Units are given sales targets that 
usually require greater sales this year than last year. If the firm has made an estimate of the 
total demand, a market share figure accompanies the sales target for two reasons: (1) the 
MNE wants to increase its sales; and (2) the firm at least wants to maintain, if not increase, 
market share. If the market is judged to be declining, sales targets are lowered but the MNE 
still tries to maintain market share. 
 A third performance area is costs. The MNE wants to achieve increased sales and mar-
ket share at as low a cost as possible. It also wants to maintain close control of production 
costs. So expenses are monitored carefully. This is particularly important in declining 
markets, where the company will want to cut costs as sales decline. For example, if an MNE 
estimates that it has only three years of product life in the market, it is likely that much of 
the advertising and promotion expenses will be dropped as the company focuses attention 
on supplying an ever-decreasing number of customers. This strategy is often successful 
because the remaining customers are highly loyal and do not need promotional efforts to 
convince them to buy the product.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 New product development is another area of performance measure. This area is 
extremely important for firms that rely on new offerings. A good example is Nintendo, the 
Japanese manufacturer of such well-known video games as Mario Brothers, which must 
continually introduce new product offerings in order to maintain market share and sales 
growth. MNEs in high-tech areas such as electronic goods and computers also fall into 
this category. In an environment where product improvement or innovation is critical to 
success, new product development is a key area for control and evaluation. 
 MNE/host-country relations is another performance area that must be evaluated. Overseas 
units have to work within the cultural and legal framework of the host country. Many 
attempt to do this by blending into the community, hiring local managers and employees, 
adapting their product to the demands of that market, reinvesting part (if not all) of their 
profits back into the country, and working to improve the area’s economic conditions. As 
a result, they get on well in the country and there are no problems with the government or 
other local groups. One thing MNEs know from long experience is that poor host-country 
relations can seriously endanger profits and even result in a loss of invested capital. 
 Finally, management performance must be considered. In rating this criterion, the 
MNE considers two types of measures: quantitative and qualitative. In the quantitative 
area, in addition to those discussed above, other common considerations include return on 
invested capital and cash flow. In the qualitative area, in addition to host-country relations, 
consideration is given to relations with the home office, the leadership qualities of the 
unit’s managers, how well the unit is building a management team, and how well the 
 managers of the unit have implemented the assigned strategy. 
 These methods of measurement are used in arriving at an overall assessment of the 
unit’s performance. Based on the results, the MNE can then set new goals and the inter-
national strategic planning process begins anew.

 On what basis would a firm like Vodafone evaluate performance? Identify and 
describe two. 
 Vodafone uses a number of bases on which to evaluate performance. One is market share. 
Note that the firm keeps track of how many subscribers it has by multiplying its ownership 
position in a venture by the venture’s total subscription base. Another is overall worldwide 
market share. Finally, the firm evaluates its performance by its success in setting a foot-
print in all major markets.

 1   Strategic planning is the process of determining an organization’s basic mission and long-
term objectives, then implementing a plan of action for attaining these goals. In carrying 
out their strategic plan, most MNEs tend toward one of four specific predispositions: 
ethnocentric, polycentric, regiocentric, and geocentric. Each was described in the chapter.  
 2   The international strategic planning process involves three major steps: strategy formu-
lation, strategy implementation, and the control and evaluation of the process. Strategy 
formulation entails the evaluation of the enterprise’s environment and the identification

CHAPTER 8 MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
of long-range and short-range objectives. The analysis of the external environment typi-
cally involves information gathering and assessment, wherein consideration is given to the 
five forces that determine industry competitiveness: buyers; suppliers; new entrants to the 
industry; the availability of substitute goods and services; and rivalry among the competi-
tors. The analysis of the internal environment involves consideration of the firm’s physical 
resources and personnel competencies and the way in which a value chain analysis can be 
used to bring these resources together in the most synergistic and profitable manner.  
 3   Strategy implementation is the process of attaining predetermined goals by properly 
executing the formulated strategy. Three of the most important areas of consideration 
are location, ownership decisions, and functional area implementation.  
 4   The control and evaluation process involves an examination of the MNE’s performance 
to determine how well it has done and to decide what action now needs to be taken. 
Some of the most common measures include return on investment, sales growth, mar-
ket share, costs, new product development, host-country relations, and overall manage-
ment performance.

 REAL CASE 
 Mountain Equipment Co-op: a small business 
 Outside of Canada, few people have ever heard of the 
Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC), but it is one of the most 
successful small businesses in the world. The company 
currently holds 65 percent of the Canadian market for 
outdoor equipment, far outdistancing all other competitive 
MNEs and retail brands in the country. In fact, MEC is so 
efficient that its products are priced lower than those of 
any North American competitor. 
 MEC was founded in 1969 when a group of six outdoor 
enthusiasts decided to get together and purchase expen-
sive outdoor equipment. In August 1971 the organization 
was officially registered as a co-op and began operating 
under a member-elected board of directors that assumed 
responsibility for setting overall policy and overseeing 
management of all operations. Today MEC has 2.8 million 
members, operates stores in 14 cities across Canada, an 
international mail-order clientele and online shopping, and 
a worldwide network of suppliers. For a one-time $5 fee, 
members are able to enjoy a wide variety of benefits 
from an organization that focuses heavily on four primary 
objectives: keeping costs down, offering affordable goods, 
providing high-quality merchandise, and maintaining high 
ethical standards. 
 Regarding the first of these, MEC takes a number of 
steps to control costs and offer affordable products. One 
is to use the clout of its large membership as a basis for 
extracting the best possible prices from suppliers, thus 
being able to offer low-cost products. Another is to keep 
the number of staff to a minimum. Some of the ways it does 
this is through the use of self-service in all stores and the 
promotion of its international mail-order business, which 
can be handled by a small number of personnel. In addition, 
the co-op minimizes overall marketing expenses by relying 
heavily on customer word-of-mouth and the mail-order 
network to help promote its products. 
 MEC also places a great deal of importance on the qual-
ity of goods. Its buyers and designers look not only for a 
low price from suppliers, but also for products that provide 
both functionality and durability. In addition, the co-op 
offers a lifetime guarantee on most of its products, regard-
less of whether it manufactured them, had them provided 
by an outsourcer, or purchased them from a large brand 
name company. 
 Co-op members are also assured that the company 
adheres to the highest ethical practices. MEC is an inno-
vator in a number of areas ranging from human rights to 
the environment. Its stores are designed with the utmost 
attention to the environment, using as much natural light 
as possible, high-efficiency HVAC (heating, ventilation, and 
air-conditioning), low-consumption water fixtures, and 
recyclable materials. As an example, its Ottawa store uses 
only half the energy of a conventional building. In addition,

CHAPTER 8 MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
as a member of the 1 percent for the Planet, the co-op gives 
1 percent of gross sales each year to environmental and 
conservation groups. At the same time, its retail employees 
are among the best paid in the country and its buyers and 
inspectors are charged with ensuring that all factory 
workers in foreign countries receive a reasonable living 
wage and work under safe conditions.     
 MEC has undertaken many business initiatives to better 
serve its members, to secure long term financial sustain-
ability and to promote its care about environment. For 
example, in 1997, MEC introduced its popular and free of 
charge online gear swap where members can recycle used 
outdoor gear. 
 Some suppliers, such as Sierra Designs, Salomon, Arc 
Tyrex, North Face, and Patagonia, see MEC as a threat 
and have refused to sell to it. In many cases, however, this 
strategy has proven to be counterproductive, resulting 
in MEC designing and manufacturing these products and 
then successfully competing with the traditional brands 
that were unwilling to sell to it. In addition, the co-op’s 
increased involvement in manufacturing has enabled it to 
monitor its suppliers’ operations more closely. 
 Over the past couple of decades, MEC’s strategy has 
been more emergent than calculated. Yet it has proven to 
be a successful business venture that has brought together 
a large group of dedicated environmentalists and other 
customers who need products for outdoor activities. In the 
process, the co-op has created a “style” and “brand” pres-
ence that appeals to outdoor enthusiasts. In fact, MEC’s 
outdoor gear has become so popular that even urbanites, 
highly unlikely to go trekking or camping in the outdoors, 
are now becoming members. As a result, annual revenues 
are currently in the range of CAD$250 million and the com-
pany is continuing to expand operations across Canada. 
 MEC was able to flourish as a result of the huge margins 
enjoyed by its competitors. This allowed the co-op both to 
reduce prices and to maintain higher levels of environ-
mental and labor practices than its competitors. Over the 
next few years, however, as competition grows and large 
outdoor retailers exert the same kind of pressure on 
 suppliers that allowed it to sell at lower prices, MEC will 
have to switch its strategy to remain competitive. It has some 
advantages. For one, it has no shareholders and reinvests 
most of its surplus into the company. MEC still has to exploit 
to the fullest its community and environmental contributions. 
In the spirit of keeping advertising costs low, many members, 
not to mention potential members, have never heard of 
MEC’s social policies or its charitable contributions.

 Benetton 
 Famous for its shocking advertisements, Benetton was 
founded in 1955 by Luciano, Giuliana, Gilberto, and Carlo 
Benetton. Initially the family sold colored sweaters door-
to-door in Treviso, Italy. Over time, a regional network of 
family, friends, and agents set up a closely monitored set 
of distinctive retail outlets. Over a 15-year period, Benetton 
built up 300 affiliated but independently owned outlets 
in Italy and a factory with new methods to dye and con-
dition wool. The company was not directly involved in the 
retail outlets, which received high-quality products at low 
costs. Part of the manufacturing savings was realized by 
outsourcing to neighboring subcontractors. For the year 
ended December 31, 2009, Benetton had total revenue of 
US $2.849 billion (€ 2.049 billion) and a workforce of 90,000 
employees. 
 Benetton has kept this loose network of independent 
production subcontractors and distribution agents but has 
now built up to a network of more than 6,000 retail stores 
in 120 countries around the world. Only a small fraction of 
these are flagship stores owned by the group. The great 
 REAL CASE

majority of its retail stores is operated by independent 
entrepreneurs. About 90 percent of production still takes 
place in Europe, mainly in the Northern Italian region around 
Treviso and the group produces over 150 million garments 
every year. And the company is still 69.35 percent owned 
by the Benetton family. Yet the wool it uses to  produce 
its clothing line is now imported from foreign countries. 
The parent company raises sheep in 900,000 hectares 
of land in Argentina. 
 Benetton is one of those successful companies that suc-
ceeded partly because its production and design concept 
was built on a strong home base. It expanded the market-
ing end of its business through closely monitored (but not 
owned) independent stores, which were able to use the 
Benetton brand name and distinctive colors and were sup-
ported by clever international advertising. 
 Benetton does not advertise its clothes directly. Rather, 
its ads target a “lifestyle.” The “United Colors of Benetton” 
ads were designed for a homogeneous global consumer 
interested in fast cars and a fast lifestyle. Benetton goes in 
for cutting-edge advertising that grabs public attention. This 
created an image of new-age awareness, as the company’s 
advertising ads have featured AIDS, capital punishment, 
inter-racial relations, high art, and “attitude.” The firm 
also sponsors a top Formula One team as well as teams 
in rugby, basketball, and volleyball, all of which contrib-
utes to the success of its brand name. Fabrica, Benetton’s 
Communication Research Center just outside Treviso, is 
a mixture of philanthropy and advertising. The center 
sponsors 50 artists for a year and exhibits their work and 
publishes it in  Colors , the company’s art-focused magazine. 
 How well this plays out globally is uncertain. For example, 
Benetton had 700 retail stores in the United States in 1988, 
but only 150 by 1995. Is this because Benetton has too 
European an image to succeed in middle America? How 
can an Italian family firm understand the American lifestyle 
from its European bases? Indeed, 82 percent of its revenue 
was generated from its home region, Europe, of which 
48 percent was derived from Italy, 34 percent from 
Europe (excluding Italy), Asia 14 percent, Americas only 
3 percent and rest of the world 1 percent.The firm is now 
looking to expand into emerging markets where potential 
for growth among the growing middle class is greatest.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 The primary purpose of an organizing strategy is to help an 
enterprise implement its strategic plan. There are a number of 
basic organization structures from which to choose, although most 
MNEs tailor-make their design and sometimes use a combination 
of different structures. Another major area of organizing strategy is 
the organizational processes of decision making, communicating, 
and controlling. These processes are fundamental to the efficient 
operation of the structure, and management will need to decide how 
they should be carried out. This chapter examines the key elements 
of organizing strategy. 
  The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  organization structures used by enterprises that are just 
beginning their international expansion.  
 2  Describe  the international division and global structures that are 
used as firms increase their international presence.  
 3  Analyze  the key structural variables that influence international 
organization designs.  
 4  Review  the role of the organizational processes in ensuring that 
the structure is both effective and efficient.

CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
 In 1837, William Procter, a candle maker, and his brother-
in-law James Gamble, a soap maker, partnered to create 
a company that would manufacture and market soaps and 
candles from its base in Cincinnati, Ohio. When candles 
declined in popularity with the invention of the light bulb 
and production was eventually discontinued in the 1920s, 
soap became the basis from which the company built a 
successful product portfolio of cleaning products and 
eventually allowed Procter & Gamble to branch out into 
cosmetics, food, and pet products. 
 During P&G’s first century, international expansion was 
an afterthought. In 1915, a Canadian plant was established, 
the first outside the United States. P&G’s first overseas 
subsidiary was established with the purchase of Thomas 
Hedley & Sons Co., Ltd. in England in 1930. This coincided 
with the birth of P&G’s brand management market-
ing system. Dedicated teams would work on marketing 
competing brands worldwide. In 1948, P&G established 
an overseas division to manage its growing international 
division, which at the time reached Asia, Europe, and Latin 
America. By 1963, as a result of European expansion, P&G 
established the European Technical Center in Belgium to 
serve common market subsidiaries. The Japanese market 
was entered in 1973 through the acquisition of the Nippon 
Sunhome Company, and in 1993 the Japan Headquarters 
and Technical Center opened in Rokko Island in Kobe City. 
 By 1995, sales outside the United States had reached 
more than 50 percent of total sales, and a new top manage-
ment team, headed by John E. Pepper, changed the organi-
zation structure of the firm from US and International to 
four regional sectors: North America; Latin America; Asia; 
and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. All regional sec-
tors reported to the chief operating officer. 
 By 2004, P&G had the workings of a global company 
in terms of its structure. Three interactive parts, whose 
subsidiaries are strategically placed around the world to 
best achieve cost-effectiveness, marketing and produc-
tion, and design quality, are the basis of this structure. 
First, there are seven Market Development Organizations 
(MDOs) responsible for marketing products in the following 
regions: North America; ASEAN, India, Australia; China; 
North-East Asia; Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle 
East, and Africa; and Western Europe and Latin America. 
Second, these MDOs collaborate with any one of five 
product-based Global Business Units (GBUs) responsible 
for R&D, design, and the manufacturing processes. Third, 
there are Global Business Services (GBSs) located mainly 
in developing countries that provide accounting, human 
resource management, logistics, and system operations in 
a given region. Finally, a Corporate Functions (CF) segment 
oversees operations but delegates decision making to each 
structural unit. 
 In  Figure   9.8    below, the MDOs are equivalent to 
marketing-based Area Profit Centers; the GBUs can be 
placed where the Business Profit Centers are. The GBSs, 
in turn, can take the place of Function Cost Centers. These 
three sectors interact with each other under the guidance 
of Corporate Functions. 
 This global three-axis matrix structure, however, has not 
resulted in an even distribution of sales across all three 
regions of the triad, or across P&G’s seven-region segmen-
tation. For the year ended June 30, 2010, P&G is ranked 
the 66th-largest company by sales (Fortune Global 500) 
with total revenue of US $78.937 billion. A closer analysis 
indicates that revenues in North America are 42 percent, 
Western Europe 21 percent, Central and Eastern Europe 
13 percent, Latin America 9 percent, and Asia 15 percent. 
P&G reported that by market maturity, 34 percent and 
66 percent of total sales are generated from developed and 
developing markets respectively. 
 The firm’s most important firm-specific advantage (FSA) 
is its ability to market products in multiple regions. It does 
this through product adaptation, marketing, and packaging 
to the needs of customers in diverse regions and by creat-
ing successful brands. Indeed, the firm managed the top 
23 brands that each generates more than billion dollars 
in annual sales. These 50 leadership brands account for 
90 percent of P&G sales. Some of its most famous brands 
include Tide, Ariel, Pantene, and Crest. 
 P&G’s strategy does not necessarily include developing 
global brands like Pringle’s, its most globally diversi-
fied brand. Instead, the firm might choose locally trusted 
brands to channel new products to multiple regions. 
Blendax, a European brand, is now the portal through 
which P&G markets Whitestrips that are sold in North 
America under the Crest brand. Many successful brands 
were carefully picked up through acquisitions and then 
revamped with new marketing. Between 1980 and 2000, 
P&G acquired Cover Girl, Noxzema, Clarion, Oil of Olay, 
Blendax, Old Spice, Max Factor, and Pantene, among 
others. In other words, the firm finds regional brands to 
develop regionally. 
 Another firm-specific advantage is that P&G’s portfolio 
of products allows the diffusion of R&D to different product

lines in all regions. For example, a fabric detergent dis-
covery may create improved versions of Tide and Cheer in 
North America, Ariel in Latin America, and Bold in Japan. It 
might also spill over to non-fabric cleaners such as Salvo. 
This, and the GBUs’ ability to coordinate production across 
the world, translate into scale economies that are difficult 
to rival in the industry. 
 P&G has gone further than most companies in creating 
a global structure that incorporates non-industrialized 
countries. For example, in 2004, the GBS for the Americas 
was located in Costa Rica, while that in the Philippines pro-
vides services to the Asian region. Factories are located in 
Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America as well as in more 
developed countries. R&D, usually reserved for developed 
nations, has also seen its way to developing countries like 
China.

structure optimal?

  Why was the international division replaced by the matrix structure?

  Why does the company rely on decentralized decision making? 
 4 
  In controlling its operations, what are three areas that are paramount for the firm? 
 This chapter on organization strategy is intimately related to the previous chapter on stra-
tegic management. Indeed, there is an unresolved debate about whether strategy follows 
structure or whether structure follows strategy. We do not need to resolve this debate, but 
simply to recognize the interconnections between strategy and structure. As shown in the 
introduction to the previous chapter, it is essential to link the issues of organization struc-
ture to the previous frameworks of international business. In particular, the FSA–CSA 
matrix of  Chapter 2 is relevant. 
 In this chapter we will see that many firms operate in a centralized and hierarchical 
manner. These structures are suitable for firms pursuing strategies of economic integration, 
for example, where worldwide economies of scale are being obtained. As was shown in the 
previous chapter, a strategy of economic integration can occur in cell 1 of the FSA–CSA 
matrix. By the end of this chapter the student will realize that a centralized and hierarchical 
structure is usually followed by firms pursuing a cell 1 strategy of economic integration. 
 In contrast, firms which pursue marketing strategies and differentiate their products 
and or services by building strong brand names are best positioned in cell 4 of the FSA–
CSA matrix. In cell 4, where FSAs are divorced from CSAs, the appropriate organization 
structure need not be one of hierarchy. A multinational firm may need to adapt its product 
or service to various foreign markets. This strategy of national responsiveness (discussed in 
 Chapter 10 ) may require a decentralized organization structure, one where more auton-
omy is given to subsidiary managers. 
 Finally, in cell 3 of the FSA–CSA matrix it may be necessary to combine the advantages of 
both a centralized and decentralized organization structure. Somewhat paradoxically, this is 
often called a matrix structure. Such a matrix organization structure, where complementary 
assets need to be combined, is consistent with a strategy in cell 3 of the FSA–CSA matrix. 
 This chapter will now examine the various types of organization structures available to 
the senior management teams of multinational enterprises. We also examine how busi-
ness networks can be managed. This thinking on strategy and structure is then applied to 
 INTRODUCTION

CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
issues in production ( Chapter 12 ); marketing ( Chapter 13 ); human resource management 
( Chapter 14 ); political risk negotiations ( Chapter 15 ); and international financial manage-
ment ( Chapter 16 ). This will then be applied as an example of regional strategy in the final 
set of chapters. 
 Organizations that have decided to expand internationally do so in a number of ways. 
Some simply ship their goods to a foreign market and have a third party handle sales 
activities. If a firm’s international market is a large portion of total operations, however, 
the enterprise may play a more active role in the distribution and sale of its products, and 
this requires a more complex organization structure. Often, firms start off as exporters and 
then, as their foreign sales grow, develop more intricate structures that can handle their 
foreign operations. 1 
 Major MNEs such as IBM, General Motors, 2  Mercedes, and Mitsubishi have sophisti-
cated global structures that form the basis of their organizing strategies. Sometimes these 
firms will also have subsidiaries or affiliates that are integrated into the overall structure. 
For example, Mitsubishi has 28 core groups that are bound together by cross-ownership 
and other financial ties, interlocking directorates, long-term business relationships, and 
social and historical ties. Among these are Mitsubishi Bank, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
Asahi Glass, Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance, Nikon Corporation, and Kirin Brewery.       3 
The Mitsubishi Group obviously needs a carefully designed global structure that allows it 
to integrate and coordinate the activities of these many businesses. Sometimes this under-
taking involves more time and effort than the formulation of the strategic plan.  
 Multinational enterprises cannot implement their strategies without an effective struc-
ture. 4  The strategy sets out the plan of action, but the structure is critical in ensuring 
that the desired goals are met efficiently. A number of choices are available to an MNE 
when deciding on an organizational arrangement, and a number of factors can influ-
ence this choice. For example, firms that are just getting into the international arena 
are likely to choose a structure that differs from that of firms with established overseas 
operations. Conversely, companies that use their structures as worldwide sales organizations 
will have a different arrangement from those that locally manufacture and sell goods 
in various international markets. International structures will change in compliance 
with the strategic plan, and a structure that is proving to be unwieldy or inefficient will 
be scrapped in favor of one that better meets the needs of the company.       5  The following 
discussion examines some of the most common organizational arrangements used 
by MNEs. 
 Early organization structures 
 When a company ﬁ rst begins international operations, such activities are typically exten-
sions of domestic operations. The ﬁ rm’s primary focus continues to be the local market; 
international involvement is of secondary importance. International transactions are con-
ducted on a case-by-case basis, and there is no attempt to consolidate these operations into 
a separate department. Under this arrangement, international sales are viewed as supple-
ments to the income earned from home-country operations. 
 As international operations increase, however, the MNE will take steps to address this 
growth structurally. One way is by having the marketing department handle international 
sales. All overseas operations are coordinated through this department; if sales warrant it, 
some of the salespeople will handle international transactions exclusively. In this way the

company develops marketing specialists who learn the specific needs and marketing tech-
niques to employ in overseas selling. 
 An alternative arrangement is to create an export department. This department may 
report directly to the chief executive officer (CEO) ( Figure   9.1   , line ( a )) or be a subdepart-
ment within the marketing area ( Figure  9.1 , line ( b )). If it operates independently of the 
marketing department (option ( a )), it is either staffed by in-house marketing people whose 
primary focus is on the international market or operated by an outside export manage-
ment company that is hired to provide the company with an international arm. Whichever 
approach is taken, MNEs planning to increase their international presence must ensure 
that the export department is a full-fledged marketing department and not just a sales 
organization. 
 Another possible arrangement is the use of overseas subsidiaries (see  Figure   9.2   ). This 
is often a result of individual ventures in various geographic locales in which the head of 
the venture is given a great deal of autonomy and reports directly to the CEO. As long 
as the subsidiary shows sufficient profit, it is allowed to operate free from home-office 
interference. 
 As MNEs become more involved in foreign markets, the export department structure or 
subsidiary arrangement is generally discarded or supplemented because it cannot meet the 
organization’s changing needs. As a result, the company will now look into joint ventures       6 
and foreign direct investment, likely opting for an international division structure. To 
examine one company’s international organization structure, see the case  International 
Business Strategy in Action: Sanofi-Aventis.

  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Sanofi-Aventis 
 The French firm Sanofi-Synthélabo acquired Aventis, its most 
important and much larger French rival, in 2004, creating 
the sixth-largest pharmaceutical company in the world, 
Sanofi-Aventis. The new company is the result of a succes-
sion of approximately 10 major mergers and acquisitions. 
Aventis itself was the product of a 1999 merger between 
French Rhône-Poulenc and Hoechst of Germany.  
 Sanofi-Aventis is a pharmaceutical group engaged in 
the research, development, manufacture and marketing 
of healthcare products. Its business includes two main 
activities: pharmaceuticals and human vaccines through 
Sanofi Pasteur.  It is also present in animal health prod-
ucts through Merial Limited (Merial). In its pharmaceutical 
activity, it specializes in six therapeutic areas: diabetes, 
oncology, thrombosis and cardiovascular, central nervous 
system (CNS), and internal medicine. The global port-
folio of Sanofi-Aventis also consists of a range of other 
pharmaceutical products in Consumer Health Care (CHC) 
and other prescription drugs, including generics. It offers 
vaccines in five areas: pediatric combination vaccines, 
influenza vaccines, adult and adolescent booster vaccines, 
meningitis vaccines, and travel and endemic vaccines. 
 In 2009, Sanofi-Aventis had revenues totaling $43.405 bil-
lion (see  Table   1   ), and was in the process of deciding the 
organization structure that will best help it coordinate all 
of its worldwide operations. The company continues to be 
based in France, but most of its sales are to foreign markets. 
Europe, its home-region base, accounts for 41.1 percent 
of its sales. The United States alone accounts for 32.2 per-
cent. The remaining 26.7 percent of sales originate in other

Aventis itself had managed to become one of the major com-
petitors in its industry through mergers and acquisitions. 
Back in the mid-1980s Rhône-Poulenc was the 12th-largest 
chemical firm in the world, with 80 percent of sales being 
generated in Europe. In this environment it competed with 
a large number of firms, including US-based giants DuPont, 
Dow Chemical, and leading European chemical companies 
such as Hoechst, BASF, Ciba-Geigy, and ICI.  
 During this period, the chemical industry was being

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 The international division 
 The  international division structure centralizes all international operations (see  Figure  9.3 ), 
an arrangement that offers a number of advantages. First, it reduces the CEO’s burden 
of direct operation of overseas subsidiaries and domestic operations. 7  Second, it creates 
a management team that prioritizes overseas operations. All information, authority, and 
decision making related to foreign efforts is channeled to this division, so there is one cen-
tral clearing point for international activities. This structure also helps the MNE to develop 
a cadre of internationally experienced managers. 
Rhône-Poulenc decided to consolidate its successful 
European base and move into the North American market. 
In the late 1980s the firm made 18 acquisitions in the United 
States, including Union Carbide Agrochemical Products and 
Stauffer Basic Chemicals. These acquisitions made the com-
pany the seventh-largest chemical manufacturer in the world, 
generating over 20 percent of its total sales in the US market. 
 Managing its US operations was not easy. The takeover 
of Union Carbide worked pretty well because the latter’s 
pesticide products were complementary to those of Rhône-
Poulenc’s herbicides and fungicides and its corporate 
culture was similar. However, the Stauffer acquisition 
proved to be more difficult because there were overlapping 
product lines and the US managers at Stauffer had little 
international experience. 
 To improve the efficiency of its diverse US operations, 
Rhône-Poulenc adapted a highly decentralized organiz-
ation structure, consolidating its US business operations 
into a US country group with headquarters at Princeton, 
New Jersey. The firm also established English as the 
official language of the company, even though its parent 
company was French. And as an intermediate step on 
the path toward true globalization, the firm’s US regional 
headquarters served to create a strong US presence in the 
face of vigorous competition from rivals with both efficient 
production and effective staffing. Rhône-Poulenc’s plan for 
the future was to create a “transnational” structure. 
 The new Sanofi-Aventis can take advantage of the steps 
already taken by Aventis and its predecessor, Rhône-
Poulenc, to maintain a strong presence in the US market. 
However, that might not be enough. In 2007, rumors started 
to circulate that Sanofi-Aventis was considering purchasing 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, which presently has a distribution 
deal with Sanofi-Aventis. This deal would be a strong push 
toward becoming a strong competitor in the US market. 
However, as of 2010, Sanofi-Avenvis and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb are still two separate pharmaceutical companies.

CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
 But the international division structure also has some significant drawbacks. One is that 
separating operations into two categories, domestic and international, can create rivalries 
between the two. Second, this arrangement puts pressure on the home office to think in 
global terms and to allocate resources on the basis of overall market opportunity. This can 
be extremely difficult for a management that has been domestically focused and makes 
the majority of its sales in the home market. Despite these drawbacks, the international 
division structure remains dominant among US MNEs.  
 Global organization structures 
 As MNEs generate more and more revenues from their overseas operations, their strategies 
become more global in focus and the structures used to implement them follow suit. European 
ﬁ rms are a good example. Because their domestic markets are fairly small, these companies 
have traditionally had global structures. In all, there are six basic types: (1) global product, 
(2) global area, (3) global functional, (4) matrix, (5) mixed, and (6) transnational network. 
 Global product structure 
 A  global product structure is an arrangement in which domestic divisions are given world-
wide responsibility for product groups.  Figure   9.4    provides an example. In this arrange-
ment, each product division sells its output throughout the world. As seen in the case of 
Product Division C, the European group operates in a host of countries. The same would 
be true for the other four geographic areas noted. In each case, the manager of the product 
division would have internal functional support for the entire product line. All production, 
marketing, personnel, and ﬁ nance activities associated with Product C would be under the 
control of this individual. In recent years, Procter & Gamble has used this arrangement to 
market its wide assortment of products, from paper goods to beauty care, whereas Ford 
Motor Company has worked to establish a single automotive operation that relies on a 
global product structure. 8 
 This arrangement employs a product division structure that relies on the “profit center” 
concept. Each product line is expected to generate a predetermined return on investment

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
(ROI), and the performance of each line is measured on this profit basis. Each product line 
is also operated like an autonomous business, with the product division manager having 
a great deal of authority over how to run the operation. As long as the product line con-
tinues to generate the desired ROI, the division is usually allowed to operate unfettered by 
home-management controls. The only major exception is budgetary constraints that are 
imposed by central management. 
 A global product division structure has several benefits. If the firm produces a large 
number of diverse products, the structure allows each major product line to focus on the 
specific needs of its customers, which would be particularly difficult to achieve if the com-
pany were trying to sell all these products out of one centralized marketing department. 
The structure also helps develop a cadre of experienced, well-trained managers who under-
stand a particular product line. And it helps the company match its marketing strategy to 
specific customer needs. For example, a product may be in the introduction stage in some 
areas of the world, and in the growth, maturity, or decline stage in others. These differ-
ing life cycles require close technological and marketing coordination between the home 
market and the foreign market, which can best be achieved by a product division approach. 
The product structure also helps the organization establish and maintain the necessary link 
between the product development people and the customer. By continually feeding back 
information from the field to the home office, product division personnel ensure that new 
product offerings meet consumer needs. 
 At the same time, there are drawbacks to the product division arrangement. One is 
the necessity of duplicating facilities and staff personnel within each division. A second is 
that products that sell well are often given primary attention while those that need special 
handling or promotion are often sidetracked, even though this may result in the long-
run loss of profit. A third is that an effective product division requires managers who are 
knowledgeable about the worldwide demand for their products. Most managers know the 
local market but do not know a lot about international markets. So it takes time to develop 
the necessary managerial staff to run this type of structure. A fourth shortcoming is the 
difficulty of coordinating the activities of different product divisions. For example, the 
electronics division may decide to subcontract components to a plant in Germany, while 
the computer division is subcontracting work to a firm in France. If the two divisions had 
coordinated their activities, it might have been possible to have all the work done by one 
company at a lower price. Finally, lack of cooperation among the various product lines 
can result in lost sales, given that each division may have information that can be of value 
to another. However, because of the profit center concept, each product line operates 
independently, and communication and cooperation are downplayed, if not discouraged.  
 Global area structure 
 A  global area structure   is a polycentric (host country-oriented) structure in which pri-
mary operational responsibility is delegated to area managers, each of whom is responsible 
for a speciﬁ c geographic region.  Figure   9.5    provides an example. Every regional division 
takes responsibility for all functions in its area—production, marketing, personnel, and 
ﬁ nance. There appears to be some structural similarity between a global area and a global 
product arrangement; however, they operate in very different ways. With a global product 
arrangement, each product division is responsible for its output throughout the world. 
With a global area structure, on the other hand, the individual product lines are subsumed 
within each of the geographic areas. So the manager in charge of Belgian operations, for 
example, will be responsible for each of the product lines sold in that region.   
 A global area structure is commonly used by MNEs that are in mature businesses and 
have narrow product lines that are differentiated by geographic area. Food products are a 
good example. 9

arrangement in which

281
CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
 The global area structure provides division managers with the autonomy to make rapid 
decisions that depend on local tastes and regulations; because of this, the firm can become 
more “nationally responsive.” Also, the company gains a wealth of experience in how to 
satisfy these local tastes, often building a strong competitive advantage in the process. The 
global area structure works well when economies of scale in production require a region-
sized unit for basic production. For example, by setting up operations in the EU, a US 
company is able to achieve production cost advantages that would not otherwise be possible. 
Finally, the company can eliminate costly transportation associated with importing goods 
produced overseas. 
 If a product sells well in the United States, the company is likely to try to market it 
worldwide without making any modifications for local taste. Under the area structure 
the opposite viewpoint holds: the product must be adapted to local tastes. But this 
means that the usual product emphasis in a company must be subsumed to the company’s 
geographic orientation and the authority of the area managers. Another shortcoming 
with this organization structure is the expense associated with duplicating facilities. 
Each division has its own functional areas and is responsible for both production and 
marketing. Because production efficiency is often based on the amount of output, small 
plants are usually less efficient than large ones. Companies using a global area division 
structure also find it difficult to coordinate geographically dispersed divisions into the 
overall strategic plan. Quite often international cooperation and synergy among divisions 
end up being sacrificed. Finally, companies that rely heavily on R&D to develop new 
products often find that the global area divisions do not readily accept these offer-
ings. This is because each group is trying to cater to the specific needs of its current 
market, and new products often require modification to meet those needs. Research 
shows that division managers prefer to sell products that have already been accepted by 
the market and are reluctant to take on new, untried products. Unfortunately, because 
most products have fairly short life cycles, this attitude is potentially dangerous to the 
long-term success of the MNE. The home office must continually fight such “anti-new 
product” drift.  
 Figure 9.5  A global area structure 

282
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Global functional structure 
 A  global functional structure   is one built around the basic tasks of the organization. For 
example, in manufacturing ﬁ rms, production, marketing, and ﬁ nance are the three primary 
functions that must be carried out for the enterprise to survive.  Figure   9.6    shows such an 
arrangement. The head of the production department is responsible for all domestic and 
international manufacturing. Similarly, the head of marketing is responsible for the sales of 
all products here and abroad. This structure is most commonly used by MNEs with a nar-
row product line that has reached a stable plateau of global coverage and a level of demand 
that does not face major changes in a competitive attack. 
 The advantages of the global functional structure are allowing a small group of 
managers to maintain control over a wide-reaching organization, little duplication of 
facilities, and tight, centralized control. One disadvantage is difficulty in coordinating the 
production and marketing areas, since each operates independently of the other. This can 
be particularly troublesome if the MNE has multiple product lines. A second disadvantage 
is that responsibility for profits rests primarily with the CEO because there is little diffusion 
of operating authority far down the line. 
 Researchers have found that the global functional arrangement is most common among 
raw materials extractors with heavy capital investment. Energy firms also use it. However, 
this is not a structure that suits many other kinds of businesses.  
 Matrix structure 
 A  matrix structure   is an organizational arrangement that blends two organizational 
responsibilities such as functional and product structures or regional and product struc-
tures. The functional emphasis focuses on the activities to be performed, whereas the prod-
uct emphasis focuses on the good that is being produced. This structure is characterized by 
a dual command system that emphasizes both inputs (functions) and outputs (products), 
thereby facilitating development of a globally oriented management attitude.  Figure   9.7    
illustrates a product–region matrix.

283
CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
 There are three types of managers in this geocentric matrix structure: regional managers, 
product managers, and matrix managers.   Regional managers   are charged with business 
in their markets. Their operation budgets include selling any of the products made by the 
MNE, subject to the decision of each regional manager. Their focus is polycentric.   Product 
managers   are responsible for coordinating the efforts of their people in such a way as to 
ensure the profitability of a particular business or product line. Their attitude is ethnocen-
tric. The matrix managers are responsible to  both  regional and product managers—they 
have two bosses. 
 With its three dimensions, the matrix design in  Figure   9.8    is more complex than that 
in  Figure   9.7   . It illustrates how the matrix organizational arrangement can be used to 
coordinate and manage wide-reaching international operations.   Resource managers 
are charged with providing the people for operations, whereas   business managers are 
responsible for coordinating the efforts of these people to make profits for the product 
line. The resource managers are concerned with inputs, business managers with outputs. 
The bottom of  Figure   9.8    shows functional specialists from such areas as marketing, 
manufacturing, and research. Individuals from each of these areas are assigned to each of 
the company’s nine businesses. In turn, these nine profit centers operate in five different 
areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Asia. Each business is run by a 
business board (not shown in the figure) that reports to senior-level management.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 The matrix design in  Figure   9.8    is sometimes referred to as a three-dimensional model 
because when it is drawn it has width, height, and depth. This multidimensional matrix 
addresses three major areas: function, product, and geography. So the structure is really a 
combination of some of the designs discussed earlier. 
 One of the major advantages of the multinational matrix is that it allows management 
to address more than one primary area of consideration. As  Figure   9.8    shows, the company 
is able to focus on functional, product, and geographic considerations. MNEs that need to 
balance a product and a global location strategy can benefit from this type of structure.       10 
 A drawback to the use of the matrix structure in international operations is the complex-
ity of the design and the use of dual command, which can result in confusion about what 
everyone is responsible for doing and to whom one reports on various matters. A second 
drawback is the large number of meetings and discussions that often result from efforts to 
coordinate a variety of different groups, each with its own agenda. A third is that it often takes 
time for managers to learn to operate in a matrix structure, and if the enterprise has rapid 
turnover, there is always a significant portion of the personnel who do not fully understand 
how to function effectively in this environment. The case  International Business Strategy in 
Action: Making matrix work describes how some of these problems can be handled. 
  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Making matrix work 
 Many multinationals use matrix structures in their inter-
national operations. Some of these structures work out very 
well; some do not. Success can often be attributed to three 
important criteria: clarity, continuity, and consistency. If all 
three are achieved, the matrix tends to work well; if one or 
more are missing, the structural design is often ineffective. 
 Clarity  refers to how well people understand what they 
are doing and why they are doing it. If the company’s basic 
objectives are clear, if relationships in the structure are 
spelled out in direct, simple terms, and if the relevance of 
jobs is enunciated, there is a good chance that clarity will 
be achieved. A good example is NEC, the Japanese giant 
that decided to integrate computers and communication 
and to make this the focus of its business efforts. This 
message was clearly communicated to the personnel so 
that everyone in the organization understood what the 
company wanted to do. On the other hand, competitors like 
AT&T tried the same strategy but failed to clarify what they 
were doing. As a result, NEC has been more successful. 
 Continuity  means that the company remains committed 
to the same core objectives and values. This provides a 
unifying theme and helps ensure that the personnel are 
committed. General Electric’s Brazilian subsidiary is a 
good example of how a lack of continuity can hurt. In the 
1960s the subsidiary built televisions. During the 1970s it 
was told to switch to large appliances. Then it was told to 
focus on housewares. By this time the company’s dominant 
franchise in Brazil’s electrical products market had all but 
dissipated. In contrast, Unilever set up operations in Brazil 
and, despite volatile changes in the economy, continued to 
focus its efforts on the electrical products market. By the 
1990s Unilever had a thriving market in that country. 
 Consistency relates to how well all parts of the organiz-
ation are moving in accord with each other. This is often a 
reflection of how well managers of the various operating 
divisions are pursuing the same objectives. For example, 
Philips NV launched an international strategy for its video 
cassette recording system, the V2000. However, its US 
subsidiary did not support these efforts because it felt that 
Matsushita’s VHS format and Sony’s Beta system were too 
well established. Because of this, Philips was unable to 
build the efficiency and credibility it needed to challenge 
the Japanese dominance of the VCR business. 
 Matrix structures can be complex organizational arrange-
ments. However, if the MNE is able to achieve clarity, continu-
ity, and consistency, the matrix approach can be very effective.

CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
 Mixed structure 
 A  mixed structure   is a hybrid organization design that combines structural arrangements 
in a way that best meets an enterprise’s individual needs.  Figure   9.9    provides an illus-
tration. While pedagogically it is important to look at the models illustrated above, in practice 
a pure function, product, or area structure hardly ever exists. Most ﬁ rms have some sort 
of mixed structure. Different businesses with different patterns of global demand, supply, 
and competition demand different management structures. Some structures might be very 
close to those mentioned above, but there is always some adaptation to be able to meet the 
needs of each speciﬁ c enterprise.  
 Transnational network structure 
 One of the newest forms of international organizational arrangements to emerge is the 
 transnational network structure , which is designed to help MNEs take advantage of 
global economies of scale while also being responsive to local customer demands. This 
structural design combines elements of functional, product, and geographic designs, while 
relying on a network arrangement to link the various worldwide subsidiaries. At the center 
of the transnational network structure are nodes, which are units charged with coordinat-
ing product, functional, and geographic information. Different product group units and 
geographical area units have different structures depending on what is best for their par-
ticular operation. A good example of how the transnational network structure works is 
provided by Philips NV, which has operations in more than 60 countries and produces a 
diverse product line ranging from light bulbs to defense systems. In all, the company has 
six product divisions with a varying number of subsidiaries in each—and the focus of 
the latter varies considerably. Some specialize in manufacturing, others in sales; some are 
closely controlled by headquarters, others are highly autonomous. 
 The basic structural framework of the transnational network consists of three com-
ponents: dispersed subunits, specialized operations, and interdependent relationships. 
 Dispersed subunits  are subsidiaries that are located anywhere in the world where they can 
benefit the organization. Some are designed to take advantage of low factor costs, whereas 
others are responsible for providing information on new technologies or consumer trends. 
 Specialized operations  are activities carried out by subunits that focus on particular product 
lines, research areas, and marketing areas, and are designed to tap specialized expertise or 
other resources in the company’s worldwide subsidiaries.  Interdependent relationships are 
used to share information and resources throughout the dispersed and specialized subunits.       11

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 The transnational network structure is difficult to draw in the form of an organizational 
chart because it is complex and continually changing.  Figure   9.10    gives a graphic scheme 
for the structure in comparison to the functional and area structures. The functional struc-
ture is one in which all decision making is made at headquarters, which coordinates all 
operations. The area, or geographic structure, is one in which each subunit acts independ-
ently from the others. That is, decision making is totally decentralized. The transnational 
network structure is a combination of both. Individual units interact with each other and 
decision making is shared across the organization. Headquarters is another business unit 
that coordinates the enterprise in coordination peripheral business units. 
 Let us now take a closer look at the transnational network structure. The peripheral 
circles represent the dispersed specialized subunits, each of which takes advantage of the 
different resources available in its environment to feed the organization. The connectors 
show the flows of components, know-how, labor, financial and marketing information, etc., 
among the different subunits. The central circle represents the headquarters, which helps to 
coordinate the interaction of the individual subunits using shared decision making.

 What type of organization structure does P&G have in place for its worldwide 
operations? Is this structure optimal? 
 P&G follows a three-axis matrix structure in which the organizational responsibilities 
are divided among (a) regional marketing, (b) product-based R&D and manufacturing, and 
(c) regional logistics. These, in turn, are overseen by the Corporate Functions department. 
Because of the scale and international reach of its operations, a matrix structure allows 
high levels of national responsiveness in the marketing of P&G’s branded products, econ-
omies of scale in R&D and production to be materialized through the Global Business 
Units, and economies of scale in logistics through the Global Business Services. Other 
types of organization structures would either constrain national responsiveness in market-
ing or undermine the company’s capacity to achieve economies of scale at a regional level.       

287
CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
 Research has shown that effective organizations follow the adage “From strategy to 
structure.” 12  They begin by formulating a strategy and only then design a structure that 
will efﬁ ciently implement this plan. In determining the best structure, three questions 
must be answered: 
 1   Can the company operate efficiently with domestic divisions or are international 
divisions also necessary? 
 2   On what basis should the organization be structured: product, area, function, mixed, or 
matrix?  
 3  How can the necessary coordination and cooperation be most effectively achieved?   
 These answers are usually determined through a careful analysis of ﬁ ve key variables. 
  Analysis of key structural variables 
 There are ﬁ ve key variables that MNEs examine in choosing from among alternative organ-
ization structures. In some cases one of these variables will outweigh the others, and the 
structure will be designed to accommodate this one. In most cases, however, there are three 
or four interacting variables that the structure must address. 
 First, the MNE will evaluate the relative importance of international operations at the 
time and project what the situation might be within three to five years. If the company is 
currently doing 5 percent of its business overseas and has an export department handling 
these sales, this organization structure may be adequate for now. However, if the MNE 
estimates that international sales will grow to 25 percent of total revenues in five years, 
the company will want to consider adopting an international division structure or one of 
the global arrangements. Unless the firm is prepared to make this transition, it may prove 
difficult to handle the anticipated rapid growth. 
 Second, the company will take into account its past history and experience in the inter-
national arena. If the firm has done very little business abroad, it is likely to choose a simple 
structure that is easy to understand and control. If the company has been doing business 
overseas for many years, it will probably have experienced managers who can work well in 
a more sophisticated structure, so it may choose a mixed design or a matrix. 
 A third area of consideration is the company’s business and product strategy. If the 
company offers a small number of products and there is little need to adapt them to 
local tastes, a global functional structure may be the best choice. On the other hand, 
if the products must be tailored for local markets, a global product arrangement will 
usually be more effective. If the company is going to be doing business in a number of 
diverse geographic areas, a global area structure will typically be used. For example, to 
improve sales growth in Europe and Asia, Coca-Cola reinforced its global area organ-
izational arrangement by putting new managers into positions overseeing operations 
in these regions. 13  
 A fourth influencing variable is management’s philosophy of operating. If the company 
wants to expand rapidly and is prepared to take risks, the firm will choose a structure that is 
quite different from that used by an MNE that wants to expand slowly and is conservative 
in its risk taking. Similarly, if the home office wants to keep a tight rein on operations, it 
will not use the same structure as a firm that gives local subsidiaries autonomy and encour-
ages them to make decisions about how to keep the unit competitive at the local level. 
 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND 
ORGANIZING STRATEGY 

288
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
French and German subsidiaries, for example, tend to be more centralized than US units. 
There are also differences in the way operations are controlled. For example, Japanese 
MNEs like to use face-to-face informal controls, whereas US multinationals prefer budgets, 
financial data, and other formalized tools. 
 A final key variable is the enterprise’s ability to adjust to organizational changes. As 
MNE world sales increase, there are continual modifications in the structure. For example, 
when the company is small, the domestic divisions dominate. As the international side 
of operations grows, the managers of the domestic divisions have to cede some of their 
authority and influence. If they are unable or unwilling to do this, the structure is affected. 
Similarly, if international executives begin gaining greater authority and there is a need 
to revamp overseas operations, their willingness to adjust to organizational changes will 
affect the structure. In some cases MNEs have found that overseas managers, just like 
their domestic counterparts, build small empires and often are unwilling to give up this 
power. 
 The ultimate choice of organization structure rests with top management. However, 
this group seldom tries to force such a decision on those who will be directly affected. 
Instead, there is a give-and-take in which the needs of the enterprise and the personnel 
are considered. 
 In recent years the increase in mergers and acquisitions has had an important impact 
on MNE decision making. Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile International provides a good 
example. By 2001 this company had an ownership position in a large number of mobile 
phone companies in a host of different countries, including Voice Stream (US), One2One 
(UK), BEN (Netherlands), max.mobil (Austria), and Radio Mobil (Czech Republic). In 
March 2011, Deutsche Telekom sold T-Mobile USA to rival AT&T for $39bn, creating the 
largest US wireless network. The deal sent Deutsche Telekom shares surging. The deal still 
needs approval from regulators. Coordinating the operations of these holdings requires 
a carefully designed structure coupled with the appropriate amount of decentralized 
authority. 14  The result can be a structure that is both efficient and humanistic. In carrying 
this out, companies will address the organizational processes that take place within the 
structure.

 Why was the international division replaced by the matrix structure? 
 The international division is a fairly primitive type of organization structure of an MNE. It is 
used at an early stage of international expansion (by P&G in the 1940s and 1950). As P&G’s 
sales in the international market increased beyond 20 percent or so, it turned to a more 
complex global organization structure, the three-axis global matrix, with which it could be 
nationally responsive and achieve economies of scale. 
 Coordination 
 The formal structure provides the skeletal framework within which the personnel operate. 
The structure is designed to answer the question: what is to be done? The organizational 
processes—decision making, communicating, and controlling—help make the structure

CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
work efﬁ ciently. These processes help answer the questions: who should do what, and how 
will they do it? These processes help put the organization structure into action. 
 Decision making 
 Decision making   is the process of choosing from among alternatives. In international 
operations one of the primary areas of consideration is where the ultimate decision-
making authority will rest on important matters. If the home ofﬁ ce holds this control, 
decision making is centralized; if the subsidiary can make many of these important 
decisions without having to consult the home ofﬁ ce, decision making is decentralized. 
 Table   9.1    provides some examples of factors that encourage both these types of decision 
making. 15   
 Research shows that decision making in MNE subsidiaries tends to vary from country 
to country or culture to culture. For example, among British organizations there is a great 
deal of decentralized decision making. Many upper-level managers do not understand the 
technical nature of business operations, such as financial budgeting or cost control, so 
they delegate the authority for these matters to middle-level managers while they focus on 
strategic matters. 
 French and German subsidiaries tend to be fairly centralized in their decision-making 
approaches. French senior executives like to maintain control of operations and tend to 
delegate less authority than do their British counterparts. German managers are hierarchi-
cal in their approach and most important decisions are made at the top. 
 In Scandinavian countries like Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, operations are highly 
decentralized both in Scandinavian-based firms and abroad. The Scandinavians place a 
great deal of emphasis on the quality of work life, and they are more interested in the well-
being of the worker than in maximizing profit. 
 The Japanese use a combination of decentralization and centralization. They make 
heavy use of a decision-making process called    ringi  , or decision making by consensus. 16 
 At the same time, top management maintains a great deal of authority over what will be 
discussed at lower levels. Thus, senior-level management exercises both decentralization 
and centralization. 
 US MNEs, perhaps surprisingly, tend to use fairly centralized decision making in 
managing their overseas operations. This is particularly true in areas such as marketing 
policies, financial matters, and decisions on production capacity. Ford Motor, for 
example, in 2001 reduced the number of managers reporting to the CEO in order to better

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Communication 
 Communication   is the process of transferring meanings from sender to receiver. However, 
the way of doing this often varies from one MNE to another. For example, US MNEs use 
direct communications with their subsidiaries and overseas units.       20  Directives are spelled 
out clearly and precisely. Meanwhile, Japanese MNEs prefer more indirect communications 
in which things are implied and it is up to the listener to determine what to do. The direct 
approach works well for Americans, whose culture encourages openness and speciﬁ c com-
munications. The indirect approach works well for the Japanese, whose culture encourages 
indirect and implied communications. 21 Ouchi, after conducting a series of interviews with 
Americans working for a Japanese bank in the United States, found that this problem can be 
particularly disconcerting because each side is unable to understand the other’s approach, 
as illustrated by the following: 
 American managers: 
 We have a non-stop running battle with the president. We simply cannot get him to specify a per-
formance target for us. We have all the necessary reports and numbers, but we can’t get specific 
targets from him. He won’t tell us how large a dollar increase in loan volume or what percent 
decrease in operating costs he expects us to achieve over the next month, quarter, or even year. 
How can we know whether we’re performing well without specific targets to shoot for? 
 Japanese bank president: 
 If only I could get these Americans to understand our philosophy of banking. To understand what 
the business means to us—how we feel we should deal with our customers and our employees. 
What our relationship should be to the local communities we serve. How we should deal with 
our competitors, and what our role should be in the world at large. If they could get that under 
their skin, then they could figure out for themselves what an appropriate objective would be for 
any situation, no matter how unusual or new, and I would never have to tell them, never have to 
give them a target. 22

 Why does the company rely on decentralized decision making? 
 The primary reason why the firm relies so heavily on decentralized decision making is 
because the demands of the local areas are so great that it cannot make all important 
decisions from headquarters. This applies to the MDOs, which must market to different 
cultures with different languages and business environments. But it also applies to the 
GBSs catering directly to a given region, which must function in the relevant languages and 
understand regionally specific logistics environments. Decision making is also delegated 
to the GBUs, which specialize to provide the most efficiency and innovation in each product 
category and to dissipate R&D knowledge across product families.

control operations. 17  On the other hand, Wal-Mart has been very successful in Canada 
by using a decentralized approach to accommodate the local market.       18 Moreover, 
this is the current trend worldwide as MNEs work to increase economies of scale and 
attain higher operational efficiency. One way in which many are doing this is through 
outsourcing, thus simplifying their structures and delegating the authority for some 
operations to their suppliers. 19  

291
CHAPTER 9 ORGANIZING STRATEGY
 These types of culturally based differences can greatly affect an MNE’s ability to get 
things done. 
 Another communication-based problem is non-verbal messages. In international 
business these take two major forms: kinesics and proxemics.   Kinesics   deals with the 
conveying of information through the use of body movement and facial expression. 
For example, when verbally communicating with someone in the United States, it is 
good manners to look the other party in the eye. However, in many other cultures, 
such as the Arabic and Middle Eastern, this is not done, especially if one is talk-
ing to a member of the opposite sex. Such behavior would be considered rude and 
disrespectful. 23  
 Proxemics   deals with how people use physical space to convey messages. For example, 
in the United States, business people typically stand 2 to 3 feet (75 cm) away from those 
with whom they are communicating. However, in the Middle East and in many South 
American countries it is common to stand right next to the person. This often makes 
Americans feel very uncomfortable because this space is generally reserved only for fam-
ily members and close friends. Business is not conducted at this distance. One group of 
authors summarized the problem this way: 
 Americans often tend to be moving away in interpersonal communication with their 
Middle Eastern or Latin counterparts, while the latter are trying to physically close the 
gap. The American cannot understand why the other is standing so close; the latter 
cannot understand why the American is being so reserved and standing so far away; the 
result is a breakdown in communication. 24 
 Another example of proxemics is office layout and protocol. In the United States, a 
large office connotes importance, as does a secretary who screens visitors and keeps away 
those whom the manager does not wish to see. In Japan, most managers do not have large 
offices; if they do, they spend little time in them since they are generally out talking to the 
employees and walking around the workplace. If the manager were to stay in the office all 
day, it would be viewed as a sign of distrust or anger at the work group. In Europe, many 
managers do not have walled-in offices. The bosses are out in the same large room as their 
people; there is no one to screen the brokers from the boss. 
 Every country has some unique communication patterns or behaviors.       25  These behav-
iors can be particularly troublesome to outsiders who are working locally and are unfamil-
iar with local approaches to communication.  Figure   9.11    provides an interesting example 
in the form of epigrams that have been drawn from organization structures throughout 
the world.   
 Controlling 
 Controlling   is the process of determining that everything goes according to plan and that 
performance is rewarded. It consists of three steps: (1) establishing standards; (2) compar-
ing performance against standards; and (3) correcting deviations. Controlling is closely 
linked to communication since it is virtually impossible to evaluate performance and make 
changes without communicating information. Many of the same organizational problems 
discussed above also apply here.  
 One of the major differences between US and Japanese firms is the use of explicit 
versus implicit control. A major difference between US and European firms is that US 
MNEs tend to rely more heavily on reports and other performance-related data, whereas 
Europeans make heavy use of behavioral control. US multinationals compare results of a 
foreign unit to those of other foreign units, as well as with domestic units, in evaluating 
performance. European MNEs tend to be more flexible and to judge performance on an

individual basis rather than simply making a comparative judgment. Other differences 
include: 
 1   Control in US MNEs relies on precise planning and budgeting that is suitable for 
comparison purposes. Control in European MNEs takes into consideration a high level 
of company-wide understanding and agreement over what constitutes appropriate 
behavior and how such behavior supports the goals of the subsidiary and the parent 
company.  
 2   US multinationals do not encourage their managers to remain in overseas positions 
for a long period of time. As a result, they use large central staffs and centralized infor-
mation gathering to carry out evaluations. European multinationals, on the other hand, 
encourage their managers to remain in overseas positions and rely heavily on these 
managers to provide input on how well the unit is doing.  
 3   Managers of US MNEs often report to a counterpart back in headquarters who, in turn, 
conveys information up the line. European multinationals have a more direct reporting 
channel so that the head of a foreign subsidiary reports to someone who is closer to the 
top of the structure.       26 
 Another major difference is the way in which personnel are evaluated. In the United 
States and Europe, it is common to single out high performers and reward them. In Japan, 
however, credit is given to the entire group rather than just to one or two individuals. 
Singling people out for special attention is not regarded as complimentary. Rather, such 
attention would make individuals feel they were not regarded as team players, which 
would be insulting. Another important difference is the time period for personnel evalu-
ations. Most US and European firms evaluate their people on an annual basis. However,

organizations. Each was created by an individual with experience in the respective country. The explanation accompanying the respective epigram 
explains the logic behind the drawing. These epigrams illustrate that communication flows throughout the world are less efficient than the enter-
prise would like. They also illustrate that each country has its own unique approach to conveying information.

 In controlling its operations, what are three areas that are paramount for 
the firm? 
 There are a number of areas P&G needs to control. One of these is profit. The company 
must ensure that its divisions are profitable in each market in which it operates. A sec-
ond area is cost control. Presently, P&G’s matrix structure is designed to be nationally 
responsive and decrease costs through economies of scale. A third area is innovation. 
One of the firm’s principal competitive advantages is its ability to improve its brands 
against the competition; as a result, it must weigh its advances in R&D against that 
of the competition. A fourth area of control is the brand awareness of consumers for 
P&G’s brands.  
 1   When a company first enters the international arena, it is common to find that these 
efforts are mere extensions of domestic operations. The MNE will typically handle 
foreign sales directly through its own marketing department, an export department, or 
an overseas subsidiary that is the result of a joint venture. As international operations 
become more important, however, the firm is likely to centralize these operations by 
adopting an international division structure. This organizational arrangement remains 
quite popular with many MNEs.  
 2   As multinationals generate increased revenues from their overseas operations, they are 
likely to adopt a global organization structure. There are six basic types: global product, 
global area, global functional, mixed, matrix, and transnational network. Each type has 
specific advantages and disadvantages.  
 3   There are five key variables that MNEs examine in choosing from among alternative 
organization structures: (a) the relative importance of international operations, (b) 
past history and experience in the international arena, (c) the company’s business and 
product strategy, (d) management philosophy, and (e) the firm’s ability to adjust to 
organizational changes.  
 4   The formal structure provides the skeletal framework within which the personnel operate. 
The organization process of decision making, communicating, and controlling make 
the structure work efficiently. In the decision-making process, one of the key areas of 
consideration is the amount of centralization or decentralization that will be used by 
the home office. In communicating, culturally based differences will be of major impor-
tance, including non-verbal messages. In controlling, areas of concern include explicit 
and implicit control and the ways in which personnel will be evaluated.    
 KEY POINTS 
in Japan the first major evaluation often does not occur until the employee has been with 
the firm for almost a decade. 27 These controlling differences greatly affect the way the 
structure is managed. As a result, running an overseas operation the same way as at home 
is often difficult.

 REAL CASE 
 LVMH: organizing luxury products in the 
international arena 
 LVMH is the French-based, world-leading luxury goods 
group that was founded in 1987 with the merger of Louis 
Vuitton and Moët Hennessy. Christian Dior, Dom Pérignon, 
Givenchy, and Moët & Chandon are just a few of LVMH’s 
world-famous luxury brand names. By 2010, revenues for 
the group totalled €20.320 billion—putting it among the 
top five marketers of luxury items (including wines). LVMH 
had 2,545 stores across the world and employed more than 
83,542 people, 77 percent of whom work outside France. 
The company generates the bulk of its sales in foreign 
markets; only 13 percent of all revenues are earned in 
France. The United States is the company’s single largest 
market comprising 23 percent of revenues. It is important 
to note that although France earns a small fraction of 
LVMH’s revenues, Europe as a whole (including France) 
accounts for 34 percent. Japan accounts for 9 percent, 
while Asia (excluding Japan) accounts for 25 percent. The 
remaining 9 percent is generated mainly in the Pacific, 
Latin America, and Canada. With over 20 percent of sales 
in each broad region of the triad LVMH is a true global 
company. 
 LVMH’s organizational arrangement is much more than 
that of a typical conglomerate. The whole organization 
focuses on shared costs and synergies, both backward and 
forward in its value chain. The five main lines of business 
are really strategic business units (SBUs) that are set up to 
market well-known, high-quality products while responding 
to local tastes and regulations. They are: (1) LVMH Fashion 
and Leather Goods; (2) Wines and Spirits; (3) Perfumes 
and Cosmetics; (4) Watches and Jewelry; and (5) Selective 
Retailing. By carefully overseeing major operations from 
the top while allowing the individual SBUs to make the 
decisions that directly affect their own local markets, 
LVMH employs a combination of “tight and loose” control to 
maximize its international presence. In the process, it has 
become the most global retail company. 
 The profit margin on luxury goods is very high, so control 
over production, distribution, and advertising is central to 
profitability. LVMH ensures that production standards in 
its manufacturing operations are the highest. It central-
izes manufacturing by using a common laboratory for 
cosmetics research and integrates the operations for 
all the branch offices in each group to ensure maximum 
efficiency. 
 Marketing is a very important part of LVMH’s strategy. 
The company spends 11 percent of all its revenues on 
worldwide advertising and purchases media products in 
bulk to receive the best value for its money. The “Made in 
France” label is stressed to appeal to its home country’s 
reputation for high-quality luxury products. The company 
sources only in France, Italy, and Switzerland.  
 The vision of a totally integrated group was and con-
tinues to be an important part of the global strategy that 
has positioned LVMH as an industry leader. The company 
walks a fine line between the exclusivity required of 
luxury goods and the size and scope of its operations. It 
might operate around the world, but its products are not 
accessible to all.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Command Alkon: a small business 
 Based in Birmingham, Alabama, in the United States, 
Command Alkon is the world leader in the design and 
supply of computer software for the construction busi-
ness. With $79.2 million in revenues in 2010, Command 
Alkon is a small MNE but it has tremendous capabilities in 
technology standardization and is number one in its soft-
ware in terms of market share, revenues, and distribution. 
Employing over 300 people, it has international offices in 
India, Colombia, France, the Netherlands, and the UK that 
market its products in each region through independent 
sales representatives. Roughly 20 percent of the com-
pany’s business is now derived outside North America. 
 Command Alkon is the result of a merger in December 
2000 of Command Data and Alkon, two construction ma -
terial software and service firms. The merger was designed 
to pool their R&D resources to compete more effectively in 
the fast-changing computer software business. Individual 
products were already compatible and the merger elimi-
nated duplication of effort. The company specialized in the 
construction business, which was largely ignored by boom-
ing software firms, so it was able to become the largest 
player in a niche market. At present, it competes only with 
two smaller, local competitors and the systems developed 
in-house by customers. 
 Command Alkon has a purely ethnocentric strategy and 
organization structure. All decisions are centralized and 
hierarchical micromanagement is the name of the game. 
The dominant culture is that of the US home office. There 
is no customization, no marketing department, no invest-
ment in local offices. It is not a “born global” firm; it is a 
US firm. Like most small businesses, Command Alkon is 
driven by its basic product or service, and it replicates its 
firm-specific advantage overseas. 
 One of the problems for small businesses is that the 
top management team is itself small. Often it comprises 
just the founder of the firm, his or her immediate family, 
and a few friends, so there is little managerial experience 
and a limited opportunity to develop international busi-
ness skills, which leads to ethnocentric behavior. Indeed, 
most small business leaders do not have the internal 
resources to build an overseer business by foreign direct 
investment; instead, they are drawn to the export mode 
of foreign entry. Thus, they need an international division 
structure. 
 There are thousands of small and medium-sized busi-
nesses (SMEs) like Command Alkon. Their business 
strategy is not as complicated as that of MNEs; usually 
SMEs are in only one line of business. The international 
experience of SMEs is usually through licensing and/or 
exporting. Rarely do they engage in foreign direct invest-
ment or develop global organization structure because 
the cost of doing business in foreign markets is often too 
high. As they expand internationally, even in software, 
they do so regionally (in their home triad) rather than 
globally.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 The primary objective of this chapter is to develop two frameworks 
for understanding how both nations and MNEs must fashion their 
strategies to achieve international competitiveness. In doing so, we 
give particular consideration to the regional economic integration 
of North America, although these frameworks are also relevant for 
other triad economies and also for emerging economy firms. 
     The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  the determinants and external variables in Porter’s 
“diamond” model of national competitiveness and critique and 
evaluate the model.  
 2  Present  a “double-diamond” model that illustrates how firms in 
non-triad countries such as Canada are using their diamond to 
design corporate strategies for the North American market.  
 3  Discuss  the benefits and effects of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement on both Mexico and Canada.  
 4  Describe  how Mexico is using a double-diamond model to tap into 
the North American market.  
 5  Define  the terms  economic integration  and  national responsiveness 
and relate their importance to MNE strategies throughout the 
world.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
 Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, Asea Brown Boveri 
(ABB) is one of Europe’s major industrial firms. Since the 
merger in 1987 that created it, ABB has been acquiring or 
taking minority positions in a large number of companies 
throughout the world. In recent years it has purchased 
Westinghouse’s transmission and distribution operations 
and Combustion Engineering, the manufacturer of power 
generation and process automation equipment.  
 ABB Ltd (ABB) provides power and automation technologies 
for its utility and industrial customers. It focuses on power 
transmission, distribution, and power-plant automation
and serves electric, gas, and water utilities, as well as 
industrial and commercial customers. ABB also delivers 
automation systems that measure, control, protect, and 
optimize plant applications across a range of industries. By 
2009, the conglomerate, which employs over 116,000 people 
worldwide, had annual revenues of $31.797 billion; 41.18 per-
cent of its revenues comes from Europe, 19.03 percent from 
the Americas, and 27.31 percent from Asia. The remainder, 
12.48 percent, comes from Africa and the Middle East. 
 ABB operates on both local and global terms. On the one 
hand it attempts to maintain deep local roots wherever it 
operates so that it can modify both products and operations 
for that market. For example, managers are trained to 
adapt to cultural differences and to learn how to communi-
cate effectively with local customers. At the same time the 
company works to be global and to make products that can 
be sold anywhere in the world because their technology 
and quality give them a worldwide appeal. 
 A good example of a business that demonstrates ABB’s 
advantages is products and services. In 2009, the com-
pany generates $9.370 billion revenues in power products 
(29.47 percent), $7.897 billion in automation products 
(24.84 percent), $7.150 billion in process automation 
(22.49 percent), $6.356 billion in power systems (20 per-
cent), and the balance in robotics. This is possible for four 
reasons: (1) ABB’s research and development makes it a 
leader in power and automation technology, enabling it to 
develop and build products and services throughout the 
world; (2) its operations are structured to take advantage 
of economies of scale and thus keep prices competitive; 
(3) it adapts to local environments and works closely with 
customers so that it is viewed as a national rather than a 
foreign company; and (4) it works closely with companies 
in other countries that are favored by their own government 
but need assistance in financing and producing equipment 
for that market. As a result, ABB is able to capitalize on 
its technological and manufacturing expertise and develop 
competitive advantages in both triad and non-triad markets. 
 In some cases ABB has gone so far as to take an owner-
ship position in companies located in emerging economic 
markets. For example, the firm purchased 76 percent of 
Zamech, Poland’s leading manufacturer of steam turbines, 
transmission gears, marine equipment, and metal cast-
ings. And it has bought into two other Polish firms that 
make a wide range of generating equipment and electric 
drives. ABB reorganized these firms into profit centers, 
transferring its own expertise to local operations, and 
developing worldwide quality standards and controls for 
production. In Mexico, ABB acquired FIP SA in 2001, an 
oil and gas production equipment company. In October 
2009, ABB Ltd. acquired Sinai Engineering Corporation to 
enhance its presence and capabilities in Western Canada. 
In January 2011, the Company acquired Baldor Electric 
Company (the United States) at the value of $4.2 billion, 
including $1.1 billion of net debt. These acquisitions also 
need to be better incorporated into its structure. 
 ABB works hard to be a “good citizen” of every country in 
which it operates, while also maintaining its supranational 
status. As a result, the company is proving that it is possible 
to have worldwide operations and local strategies that 
work harmoniously.

 In this chapter two frameworks are developed. Again it is useful to relate these to the basic 
ﬁ rm and country model ﬁ rst outlined in  Chapter 2  of this textbook. In this chapter we will 
ﬁ rst review the single-diamond model of Michael Porter (1990). We will apply it to ana-
lyze the international competitiveness of large economies such as the United States, Japan, 
and Germany. We then introduce the double-diamond framework which is more suitable 
for somewhat smaller but open trading economies, such as Canada, New Zealand, Korea, 
Singapore, and, indeed, most countries in the world. Both the Porter single diamond and 
the double diamond deal with CSAs. There are rankings of countries based on the manner 
in which their CSAs are being utilized to improve their international competitiveness. Yet, 
in this work on international competitiveness, the manner in which CSAs are turned into 
FSAs is often not made explicit. 
 The second framework outlined in this chapter is the famous economic integration 
and national responsiveness matrix. The economic integration axis is largely explained by 
CSAs. The national responsiveness axis is a pure FSA. Indeed, only in international busi-
ness can this type of FSA arise. The managers of a multinational enterprise (MNE) have 
a network of subsidiaries and national responsiveness is relevant when making decisions 
about the strategy and organizational structure of such firms. In contrast, purely domestic 
firms cannot experience FSAs in national responsiveness. Together, these two frameworks 
provide the students with the basic insights necessary to analyze the complex nature of 
the  strategy and structure of multinational enterprises and other firms involved in inter-
national business. 
 Some MNEs rely on their home market to generate the research, development, design, 
or manufacturing needed to sell their goods in international markets. More and more, 
however, they are finding that they must focus on the markets where they are doing busi-
ness as well as on strategies for tapping the resources of those markets and gaining sales 
entry. In short, multinationals can no longer rely exclusively on the competitive advantage 
they hold at home to provide them with a sustainable advantage overseas. 
 In addition, many small countries realize they must rely on export strategies to ensure 
the growth of their economies. Those that have been most successful with this strategy 
have managed to tap into markets within triad countries. Good examples are Canada 
and Mexico, both of which have found the United States to be a lucrative market for 
exports and imports. As a result, many successful business firms in these two countries 
have integrated themselves into the US economy, while creating what some international 
economists call a North American market. In the future many more MNEs are going to be 
following this pattern of linking into the economies of triad members. 
 The basic strategy that these MNEs are following can be tied directly to the Porter model 
presented in  Chapter 1 , although some significant modifications of this model are in order. 
We will first examine Porter’s ideas in more detail and then show how these ideas are serv-
ing as the basis for developing corporate strategies and international competitiveness in 
Canada and Mexico.  
 INTRODUCTION 
 In  Chapter 1  we identiﬁ ed four determinants of national competitive advantage, as set forth 
by Porter (see  Figure   10.1   ). We noted that these factors can be critical in helping a country 
build and maintain competitive advantage. We now return to Porter’s “diamond” framework 
in more depth, examining how his ﬁ ndings apply speciﬁ cally to triad countries and deter-
mining how the ideas can be modiﬁ ed and applied to nations that are not triad members.  
 THE SINGLE DIAMOND 
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES

303
CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
  Determinants and external variables 
 Porter’s “diamond” model is based on four country-speciﬁ c determinants and two external 
variables. The determinants include: 
 1  Factor conditions.  These include (a) the quantity, skills, and cost of the personnel; (b) the 
abundance, quality, accessibility, and cost of the nation’s physical resources such as 
land, water, mineral deposits, timber, hydroelectric power sources, and fishing grounds; 
(c) the nation’s stock of knowledge resources, including scientific, technical, and market 
knowledge that affect the quantity and quality of goods and services; (d) the amount 
and cost of capital resources that are available to finance industry; and (e) the type, 
quality, and user cost of the infrastructure, including the nation’s transportation system, 
communications system, health-care system, and other factors that directly affect the 
quality of life in the country.  
 2  Demand conditions.  These include (a) the composition of demand in the home 
market as reflected by the various market niches that exist, buyer sophistication, 
and how well the needs of buyers in the home market precede those of buyers in 
other markets; (b) the size and growth rate of the home demand; and (c) the ways 
in which domestic demand is internationalized and pulls a nation’s products and 
services abroad.  
 3  Related and supporting industries. These include (a) the presence of internationally com-
petitive supplier industries that create advantages in downstream industries through 
efficient, early, or rapid access to cost-effective inputs; and (b) internationally competi-
tive related industries that can coordinate and share activities in the value chain when 
competing or those that involve complementary products.  
 4  Firm strategy, structure, and rivalry.  These include (a) the ways in which firms are 
managed and choose to compete; (b) the goals that companies seek to attain as 
well as the motivations of their employees and managers; and (c) the amount of 
domestic rivalry and the creation and persistence of competitive advantage in the 
respective industry.

 The four determinants of national advantage shape the competitive environment of 
industries. However, two other variables, chance and government, also play important 
roles: 
 1  The role of chance.  Chance events can nullify the advantages of some competitors and 
bring about a shift in overall competitive position because of developments such as 
(a) new inventions, (b) political decisions by foreign governments, (c) wars, (d) signifi-
cant shifts in world financial markets or exchange rates, (e) discontinuities in input costs 
such as oil shocks, (f) surges in world or regional demand, and (g) major technological 
breakthroughs. 
 2  The role of government.  Government can influence all four of the major determinants 
through such actions as (a) subsidies, (b) education policies, (c) the regulation or dereg-
ulation of capital markets, (d) the establishment of local product standards and regulations, 
(e) the purchase of goods and services, (f) tax laws, and (g) antitrust regulation.       1 
  Figure   10.1    provides an illustration of the complete system of these determinants and 
external variables. Each of the four determinants affects the others, and all in turn are 
affected by the role of chance and government.  
  Critique and evaluation of the model 
 In applying this model to international business strategy, we must ﬁ rst critique and evalu-
ate Porter’s paradigm and supporting arguments. First, the Porter model was constructed 
based on statistical analysis of aggregate data on export shares for 10 countries: Denmark, 
Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the United States, and 
West Germany. In addition, historical case studies were provided for four industries: the 
German printing press industry, the US patient monitoring equipment industry, the Italian 
ceramic tile industry, and the Japanese robotics industry. In each case the country is either 
a member of the triad or an industrialized nation. Since most countries of the world do not 
have the same economic strength or afﬂ uence as those studied by Porter, it is highly unlikely 
that his model can be applied to them without modiﬁ cation. 
 Second, the government is of critical importance in influencing a home nation’s com-
petitive advantage. For example, it can use tariffs as a direct entry barrier to penalize 
foreign firms, and it can employ subsidies as an indirect vehicle for penalizing foreign-based 
firms. Government actions such as these, however well intentioned, can backfire and end 
up creating a “sheltered” domestic industry that is unable to compete in the worldwide 
market. 2 
 Third, although chance is a critical influencing factor in international business strategy, 
it is extremely difficult to predict and guard against. In a similar vein, technological break-
throughs in computers and consumer electronics have resulted in rapid changes that, in 
many cases, were not predicted by market leaders. 
 Fourth, in the study of international business, the Porter model must be applied in 
terms of company-specific considerations and not in terms of national advantages. As 
Porter so well notes in his book, “Firms, not nations, compete in international markets.”       3 
 Fifth, in support of his model, Porter delineates four distinct stages of national competi-
tive development: factor-driven, investment-driven, innovation-driven, and wealth-driven 
(see  Figure   10.2   ). In the factor-driven stage, successful industries draw their advantage 
almost solely from the basic factors of production such as natural resources and the 
nation’s large, inexpensive labor pool. Although successful internationally, the industries 
compete primarily on price. In the investment-driven stage, companies invest in modern,

305
CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
efficient facilities and technology and work to improve these investments through modifi-
cation and alteration. In the innovation-driven stage, firms work to create new technology 
and methods through internal innovation and with assistance from suppliers and firms 
in related industries. In the wealth-driven stage, firms begin to lose their competitive 
advantage, rivalry ebbs, and the motivation to invest declines. As seen in  Figure   10.2   , 
Porter believes that Singapore is in the factor-driven stage, Korea is investment driven, 
Japan is innovation driven, Germany and the United States are between the innovation 
and wealth-driven stages, and the UK is wealth driven. Because the stage of develop-
ment greatly influences the country’s competitive response, the placement of countries in 
 Figure   10.2    is critical. So too is the logic that countries move from one stage to another, 
rather than spanning two or more stages, because there are likely to be industries or com-
panies in all major economies that are operating at each stage.  
 Sixth, Porter contends that only outward FDI is valuable in creating competitive advan-
tage, and inbound foreign investment is never the solution to a nation’s competitive problems. 
Moreover, foreign subsidiaries are not recognized by Porter as sources of competitive 
advantage. 4  These statements are questionable and have already been rejected in this text. 
For example, scholars such as Safarian, 5 Rugman, 6 and Crookell 7  have all demonstrated 
that R&D undertaken by foreign-owned firms is not significantly different from that of 
Canadian-owned companies. Moreover, Rugman has found that the 20 largest US subsidiaries 
in Canada export virtually as much as they import (the rate of exports to sales is 25 percent, 
whereas that of imports to sales is 26 percent). 8 
 Seventh, as seen in  Figure   10.2   , reliance on natural resources (the factor-driven stage) 
is viewed by Porter as insufficient to create worldwide competitive stature.       9 However, 
Canada, for one, has developed a number of successful megafirms that have turned the 
country’s comparative advantage in natural resources into proprietary firm-specific advan-
tages in resource processing and further refining—sources of sustainable advantage. 10 
Moreover, case studies of the country’s successful multinationals such as Alcan, Noranda, 
and Nova help illustrate the methods by which value added has been introduced by the 
managers of these resource-based companies. 11 
 Eighth, the Porter model does not adequately address the role of MNEs. Researchers 
such as Dunning 12  have suggested including multinational activity as a third outside vari-
able (in addition to chance and government). Certainly there is good reason to question 
whether MNE activity is covered in the “firm strategy, structure, and rivalry” determinant,

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
and some researchers have raised the question of how the same rivalry determinant can 
both include multinationality for global industries and yet exclude it for multidomestic 
industries. As Dunning notes, “There is ample evidence to suggest that MNEs are influ-
enced in their competitiveness by the configuration of the diamond in other than their 
home countries, and that this in turn may impinge upon the competitiveness of home 
countries.” 13  For example, Nestlé earns 98 percent of its sales outside Switzerland;       14 thus, 
the Swiss diamond of competitive advantage is less relevant than that of the countries in 
which Nestlé operates. This is true not only for MNEs in Switzerland but for 95 percent of 
the world’s MNEs as well. For example, virtually all of Canada’s large multinationals rely 
on sales in the United States and other triad markets. Indeed, it could be argued that the 
US diamond is more relevant for Canada’s industrial multinationals than Canada’s own 
diamond, since more than 70 percent of Canadian MNE sales take place in the United 
States. Other nations with MNEs based on small home diamonds include Australia, New 
Zealand, Finland, and most, if not all, Asian and Latin American countries as well as a 
large number of other small countries. Even small nations in the EU, such as Denmark, 
have been able to overcome the problem of a small domestic market by gaining access to 
one of the triad markets. So in applying Porter’s framework to international business at 
large, one conclusion is irrefutable:  Different diamonds need to be constructed and analyzed 
for different countries .

 In what way does ABB’s strategy incorporate Porter’s four country-specific 
determinants and two external variables? 
 The strategy incorporates Porter’s country-specific determinants as part of a well-
formulated global strategy designed to tap the strengths of various markets. For example, 
the company draws on the factor conditions and demand conditions in Europe to support 
its power and automation business. It also draws on supporting industries to help sustain 
its worldwide competitive advantage in that industry. At the same time the company’s 
strategy, structure, and rivalry are designed to help it compete at the local level. The strat-
egy incorporates the external variable of government by considering relations between 
countries as a lubricant for worldwide economic integration. It addresses the variable 
of chance by operating globally and thus reducing the likelihood that a war or a regional 
recession will have a major negative effect on operations. The firm’s heavy focus on core 
technologies and R&D also helps minimize this chance variable.   
 Researchers have recently begun using Porter’s single diamond as a basis for analyzing the 
international competitiveness of smaller countries. This approach builds on Porter’s theme 
of corporate strategy and process as a source of competitive advantage for a nation. 
  Canada and the double diamond 
  Figure   10.3    illustrates how Porter’s single diamond would look if it were applied to Canada’s 
case. 15 
 THE DOUBLE DIAMOND 

307
CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
 Two themes have recurred consistently in Canadian industrial policy: export promo-
tion for natural resource industries and import substitution in the domestic arena. The 
Canadian market has always been seen as too small to support the development of econ-
omies of scale required in modern industry. Hence it has been the practice in Canada to 
provide the base for developing large-scale resource businesses that are designed to exploit 
the natural resources found in the country. Export strategies have emphasized commodity 
products that have been developed in isolation from major customers. In the past these 
strategies had been encouraged by US government policies that removed or eliminated 
tariffs on imports of commodities that are not produced extensively in the United States. 
The Canadian government’s role had been to help leading Canadian-based businesses 
by establishing relatively low taxes on resource extraction and by subsidizing the costs of 
capital through grants, low-interest loans, and loan guarantees.  
 With respect to import substitution, the Canadian goal had been to use tariff and non-
tariff measures to provide a protected environment for developing secondary industry. 
Under this arrangement the country’s approach to business was largely focused inwardly, 
relying solely on the extent and quality of natural resources as the basis for the creation 
of wealth. 
 By the mid-1960s, however, it had become clear that a more international focus 
was needed. The 1967 Canada–United States Auto Pact demonstrated that significant 
economic benefits would result from the elimination of tariffs on trade between the 
two countries in autos and parts. This agreement eventually became the model for the 
United States–Canada Free Trade Agreement. 16  In the process Canadian plants gained 
economies of scale by producing for the North American market as a whole rather than 
for the Canadian market alone. For corporate strategy, the result of North American 
economic integration has been the development of a Canadian–US “double diamond,” 
which shows that the two countries are integrated for strategy purposes into a single 
market (see  Figure  10.4 ).

Part Three  International Business Strategies
Under this new arrangement, Canadian businesses are now in direct competition 
with firms operating in a diamond of their own in the United States.17 To survive this 
rivalry with leading US firms, Canadian businesses have to develop competitive capa-
bilities of a high order.18 They can no longer rely on their country’s home diamond and 
natural resource base. Innovation and cost competitiveness are equally important, and this 
requires strategies that are designed to access the US diamond. Now Canadian managers 
need a “double-diamond perspective” for their strategic decisions. The double diamond 
is, of course, relevant for other small, open economies such as Finland and Sweden. The 
case International Business Strategy in Action: Nokia and Ericsson provides an example.
The Free Trade Agreement has also created a series of unique pressures on the Canadian 
subsidiaries of US multinationals, many of which were created for the purpose of over-
coming Canadian tariff barriers that were designed to encourage the development of local 
operations. These subsidiaries are now unnecessary, and many of them are currently in 
direct competition with their US-based parent. If they cannot compete successfully, future 
business will go south of the border.19
Meanwhile, major Canadian companies are working to develop competitive positions in 
the United States as well as worldwide.20 A good example is Magna International, Canada’s 
leading diversified automotive supplier headquartered in Aurora, Ontario, Canada. The 
company designs, develops and manufactures automotive systems, assemblies, modules 
and components, and engineers and assembles complete vehicles, primarily for sale to 
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of cars and light trucks in three geographic 
segments: North America, Europe and rest of world (primarily Asia, and South America). 
It is Canada’s largest automobile part manufacturer and also one of the world’s 500 larg-
est companies. The firm has now established a significant manufacturing and product 
development presence in the United States. As at September 2010, the company had 245 
manufacturing divisions and 80 product development, engineering, and sales centers 
in 25 countries. In 2009, Magna derives 18.6 percent of its total revenues from Canada,  
21.6 percent from the United States, 6.7 percent from Mexico (North America 46.9 percent) 
Western Europe 38.8 percent, the United Kingdom 4.3 percent, other European countries 
5.6 percent (Europe 48.5 percent) and the remainder from rest of world.21

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
 Bombardier Inc. provides another example. Beginning as a Canadian manufacturer of 
snow-going equipment, the company has now grown into a multinational firm with inter-
ests in aviation, transportation, and financial services. In the aviation/aerospace business, 
Bombardier has major operations in Canada and the United States, among other locations, 
and manufactures a line of business aircraft, commercial aircraft, including regional jets, 
turboprops and single-aisle mainline jets and amphibious aircraft. The company’s trans-
portation operations are located throughout North America and Europe and manufacture 
passenger trains, mass transit railcars, and engines. It also provides bogies, electric propul-
sion, control equipment and maintenance services, as well as complete rail transportation 
systems and rail control solutions.       22 
 Other major Canadian firms are following suit, operating from a North American per-
spective in order to lay the groundwork for becoming globally competitive.       23  This involves 
viewing the United States and Canada as home-based markets and integrating the use of 
both “diamonds” for developing and implementing strategy. In particular, this requires: 
 1   Developing innovative new products and services that simultaneously meet the needs 
of the US and Canadian customer, recognizing that close relationships with demanding 
US customers should set the pace and style of product development.  
 2   Drawing on the support industries and infrastructure of both the US and Canadian 
diamonds, realizing that the US diamond is more likely to possess deeper and more 
efficient markets for such industries. 
 3  Making free and full use of the physical and human resources in both countries.       24 
  Strategic clusters in the double diamond 
 The primary advantage of using the double diamond is that it forces business and govern-
ment leaders to think about management strategy and public policy in a more productive 
way. Rather than viewing the domestic diamond as the unit of analysis, managers from 
smaller countries are encouraged to always be outward looking. Doing well in a double dia-
mond is the ﬁ rst step toward global success. 
 Once a country has recognized the benefit of the double-diamond perspective, it should 
first identify successful and potentially viable clusters of industries within its borders and 
then examine their linkages and performances across the double diamond. A   strategic 
cluster   is a network of businesses and supporting activities located in a specific region, 
where the flagship firms compete globally and the supporting activities are home based, 
although some can be foreign owned. In addition, some of the critical business inputs 
and skills may come from outside the country, with their relevance and usefulness being 
determined by the membership of the strategic cluster. A successful strategic cluster will 
have one or more large MNEs at its center. Whether these are home or foreign owned is 
irrelevant so long as they are globally competitive. They are the flagship firms on which the 
strategic cluster depends. Ideally, they operate on a global basis and plan their competitive 
strategies within the framework of global competition. A vital component of the cluster 
is companies with related and supporting activities, including both private- and public-
sector organizations. In addition, there are think tanks, research groups, and educational 
institutions. Some parts of this network can even be based outside the country, but the 
linkages across the border and the leadership role of the nation’s flagships result in world-
class competitive multinationals. 25 
 Currently Canada has several strategic clusters. One is the auto assembly and auto parts 
industry in south-western Ontario, led by the Big Three US auto multinationals with their 
related and affiliated suppliers and distributors. There are linkages to various high-tech 
firms and research groups that span the border, as does the auto assembly industry itself. 
Other strategic clusters are based in banking and financial services in Toronto, advanced

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Nokia and Ericsson 
 Based in one of the world’s smallest countries, the largest 
producer of mobile phones is Finland’s Nokia. Founded in 
1865, Nokia was a major manufacturer of paper products 
before it transformed itself into a high-tech producer of 
electronic products, especially cellular phones, starting 
in the 1970s. By 2009, Nokia was the largest company in 
Finland and also among the world’s largest 500 companies 
with sales of US $56.966 billion. Production facilities span 
13 countries, and R&D is performed in 13 locations world-
wide. It generates sales in 130 countries and employs 
some 132,427 people. In 2009, Nokia derived 36 percent of 
its total sales from Europe, 38 percent from Asia–Pacific, 
including China, the Middle East and Africa 14 percent, Latin 
America 7 percent, and North America 5 percent. However, 
Nokia’s 2009 sales dropped 23 percent compared to 2008 
sales as industry watchers comment that Nokia has been 
falling behind its competitors (for example, Apple) for some 
years. In February 2011, Nokia announced a strategic alli-
ance whereby it plans to abandon its Symbian smartphone 
operating system in favour of Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7, 
in order to challenge the growing popularity of phones pow-
ered by Google’s Android operating software and the Apple 
iPhone. The Apple’s iPhone (driven by Apple’s proprietary 
iOS) has captured the top of the smartphone market while 
devices powered by Android—free, open source software—
are now available from a number of manufacturers. In fact, 
there are now more smartphones powered by Android than 
iPhones in the hands of users. The iPhone benefits from 
a “cool” and desirable image and a huge store of proved 
applications, while Android phones are cheaper and have an 
impressive user interface. RIM’s BlackBerry e-mail devices, 
which enjoyed a very short “cycle of dominance,” may also 
have missed the leading position. Taiwanese smartphone 
maker HTC is the world’s third-biggest mobile phone maker 
by market value. Samsung (Korea) is one of leading players 
in the fast growing smartphone and tablet PC market. 
 From the beginning, Nokia has pursued foreign sales. 
In 2009, Nokia derives less than 1 percent of its total sales 
from Finland, and 99 percent are foreign sales. This inter-
nationalization strategy is necessary because Finland has 
only 3 million people and only a small share of its sales 
originates in its home base. So Nokia became the mobile 
phone leader in Scandinavia, despite competition from 
Ericsson of Sweden. From there it progressed to becoming 
the leader in the UK and then the rest of Europe, and formed 
strategic alliances with US distributors such as Radio Shack 
and US telecom companies like AT&T. The firm has also 
developed special phones for Chinese and Japanese users. 
Nokia spends a large amount on R&D, which allows it to 
continuously introduce new handset models. For instance 
it introduced handsets with MP3 technology that allows a 
mobile phone to also be a portable music player. Nokia has 
a joint venture with the German electronic and electrical 
engineering Siemens AG to form Nokia Siemens Networks. 
 L. M. Ericsson employs more than 82,493 people and has 
sales of US $26.997 billion in the 140 countries in which it 
operates. In 1997, Ericsson was the world’s largest pro-
ducer of digital mobile phones. In 2009, 1.98 percent of its 
sales are from Sweden, 19.61 percent in Western Europe, 
24.57 per cent in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East 
and Africa, 31.86 percent in Asia Pacific (including China 
and India), 12.28 percent in North America, and 9.70 per-
cent in South America. Unlike Nokia, which started as a 
paper and rubber producer, Ericsson has always been in 
telecommunications, beginning in 1876 as a telephone 
manufacturer. It has always been innovative; today, one in 
four employees works in R&D. In other areas of business 
it has developed telephone switches in which it competes 
with firms such as Siemens Nokia Networks, France’s 
Alcatel Lucent and Japan’s NEC. Ericsson was well positioned 
to benefit from the telecom deregulation of the 1980s 
and 1990s. This has created new demand, especially for 
new equipment like mobile phones in areas with few local 
monopoly producers. 
 Ericsson has formed alliances with Intel, Hewlett-
Packard, and Texas Instruments. These firms act as key 
suppliers of components and products that Ericsson uses 
for voice and data transmission. The company’s relative 
weakness, compared to Nokia and Motorola, is its brand 
name. Ericsson has strong production technology but 
needs to improve on its marketing side. 
 Companies like Ericsson and Nokia will benefit from the 
alliance between AT&T and British Telecom (BT), and that 
between Sprint, France Telecom, and Deutsche Telekom. 
Such big alliances help set standardized services to which 
mobile phone producers can respond efficiently. In the 
future, mobile phones will become even smaller, but the 
two producers from small countries, Nokia of Finland and 
Ericsson of Sweden, will become even bigger.

 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
manufacturing and telecommunications in Toronto, forest products in western and east-
ern Canada, energy in Alberta, and the fisheries in Atlantic Canada. Some are led by flag-
ship Canadian-owned multinationals such as Bombardier, Magna International, Research 
in Motion (RIM best known as the developer of the Blackberry smart phone); others are 
led by, or include, foreign-owned firms such as IBM Canada and DuPont Canada.       26 
 Many Canadian clusters are resource based. The challenge for managers in these clus-
ters is to continue to add value and eliminate the commodity nature of Canada’s resource 
industries. One way to do this is to develop a global marketing strategy that builds on 
the Canadian–US double diamond instead of remaining as the extractor or harvester 
of resources. To implement such a global strategy requires a large investment in people 
who will bring strong marketing skills and develop a global intelligence network to iden-
tify the different tastes and preferences of customers. This network provides a role for 
smaller knowledge-intensive marketing research and consulting firms to participate in the 
resource-based cluster. There is also the potential for collaborative ventures. 
 The IMD World Competitiveness Scoreboard ranks Canada as one of the most com-
petitive countries in the world. Yet, in contrast with the United States, Canada does not 
fare so well. According to the IMD, the United States is the world’s most competitive 
nation. 27  A study of productivity (GDP per hours worked) by Statistics Canada shows 
Canada trailing the United States by about 6 percent. That is, for each hour of work, 
Canadians produce 94.2 percent, in dollar terms, of their US counterparts.       28 
 Further research is required to investigate Canadian strategic clusters and their com-
petitive advantages in comparison to rival clusters in North America and around the 
world. This will require two types of work. First, the intrafirm competition of clusters in 
North America needs new data that do not ignore the nature of foreign ownership and 
whether US and Canadian FDI by sector is inbound or outbound. Instead, direct invest-
ment in North America must be regarded as “domestic” and be contrasted with “external” 
direct investment from Japan 29 and the European Union. 30  Similarly, trade flows between 
Canada and the United States must be thought of as intrafirm when they occur between 
components of a cluster or even between and among clusters. 
 This approach is so radical that many existing concepts must be rethought. For example, 
the level and extent of subsidies available to clusters located in the United States (for example, 
in the Great Lakes region) must be related to those paid by provinces in Canada (such as 
Ontario). Yet there is little or no published work on state or provincial subsidies; even the 
work on federal subsidies in either country is extremely thin. 
 Finally, the real sources of Canadian competitive advantage are to be discovered not 
only by statistical analysis but also by interviews of managers and officials—that is, by 
fieldwork in the strategic clusters. Such “hands-on” research is exceptionally time consum-
ing and expensive. However, to make the task feasible a number of important strategic 
clusters can be selected for analysis, self-audits can be made, conferences can be held, and 
so on. The future success of these efforts will depend heavily on leadership by Canadian 
business leaders and government officials. 
  Mexico and the double diamond 
 We can also adapt the Porter diamond model to analyze company strategies and inter-
national competitiveness in Mexico. The basic concepts in this framework are the same as 
those discussed in the Canadian diamond. 
  Linking to the US diamond 
 Mexico’s linkage to the US diamond is somewhat different from Canada’s. One reason is 
the fact that there are few home-based MNEs that have the capital to invest in the United 

312

States or Canada.31 (Review Chapter 3 for information on how and why FDI is used by 
MNEs.) In fact, as seen in Table 10.1, during the period 2000–2009 Mexico’s FDI in the 
United States increased by $3,899 million and $161.4 million in Canada. In contrast, by 
2000 Canada had just $2,571.1 million invested in Mexico, whereas the United States had 
$39,352 million there. More important by 2009, US FDI in Canada reached $259,792 mil-
lion, and Canada’s FDI in the United States was also equivalently high at $249.714 million. 
Overall, in 10 years 2000–2009, Canada’s FDI in the United States increased more than 
double (increase by 2.11 times) while the United States’ FDI in Canada also went up 1.96 
times. Thus, Mexico’s strategy with its North American neighbors relies more heavily on 
trade than on FDI for outward market access, while using inward FDI to help promote 
internal development.
As seen in Figure 10.5, in 2008 US exports to Mexico were $151.53 billion and import 
from Mexico were $218.08 billion, while Mexico’s exports to the United States were 
$233.52 billion and imports from the United States $151.33 billion. Canada’s exports to 
Mexico were $5.49 billion and imports from Mexico $16.73 billion, while Mexico’s exports 
to Canada were $7.16 billion and import from Canada of $9.44 billion. Mexico is the 
second-largest trading partner of the United States, and although it has a negative trade 
balance with the world, it runs a positive balance with the United States. In fact, in recent 
years the latter has accounted for 80.15 percent of Mexico’s exports and 49.03 percent of 
its imports. So Mexico is closely linked with the US economy, and its economic growth will 
depend heavily on participation in this North American market.32 Figure 10.6 illustrates 
this idea with the US–Mexican double diamond.
Mexico is linking itself to the US diamond in a number of ways. One is by serving as a 
customer for outside goods. For example, Caterpillar supplies heavy equipment for road 
building in Mexico; Coca-Cola holds about half of the market for soft drinks in Mexico; 
and US soybeans dominate the Mexican oilseed market.33
At the same time, Mexican businesses and foreign subsidiaries based in Mexico are 
working to expand their links to the US market. Between 1993 and 2002, exports to the US

form of manufactured goods, particularly automobiles. In fact, auto production in Mexico 
accounts for more than 450,000 workers and generates close to 1.5 million vehicles, most 
of which are targeted for the US market.       34  Ford, for example, is investing $1 billion in 
Hermosillo, Mexico, to develop a next generation of mid-sized vehicles.       35  At the same 
time, US firms are also investing in a wide array of non-automotive projects.       36  IBM, for 
example, now produces magnetic readers for computer hard-disk drives in Guadalajara 
and flies them to California on a daily basis. In the entertainment industry, Mexican pro-
ductions have found an eager US audience with films like  Amores Perros  and  Y Tu Mamá 
También . 37 
 Maquiladoras 
 In 1965 the Mexican government established the  maquiladora  industry to attract foreign 
manufacturing operations. Imported products for the  maquiladoras ’ production are exempt 
from Mexican duties as long as they are used for exports. In recent years certain items not 
directly involved in production, such as transportation equipment and computers, have 
also been made exempt from duties. Moreover,  maquiladoras  are no longer restricted to the 
border zone, and some have been permitted to settle inland and sell ﬁ nished products on 
the domestic market. 
 Today the  maquiladora industry is one of the country’s largest sources of hard-currency 
earnings from exports, after oil. From 12  maquiladora  plants in 1965, the number had 
increased to 2,900 by 2004. 38  Principally US owned, these businesses are widely considered 
to have established a basis for more intensified economic cooperation anticipated under 
an FTA. 39  At the same time, their growth is creating friction because many Americans 
feel that the low wage rates in Mexico are causing firms to transfer work there and lay off 
employees back home. 
 What will the future hold regarding Mexico and North America? The most likely 
developments will be continued investment by US and Canadian firms and the estab-
lishment of worldwide competition there. Mexico was manufacturing and shipping 
many more products back north as well as exporting to more countries than it did 
before NAFTA. Canada is still trying to create and nurture Canadian-owned MNEs 
that will compete worldwide. Mexico hopes to build these businesses internally 
with financial and technological investments, primarily from its North American 
neighbors. 40  
 The double-diamond examples of Canada and Mexico help explain how MNEs can use 
Porter’s ideas to formulate strategies. However, these firms also need to address the issue 
of national responsiveness, the focus of the discussion in the next section.

 ABB bought Zamech for a number of reasons. Zamech provides a springboard to the East 
European market, which is likely to grow dramatically during the coming decade. ABB 
links Zamech to its overall strategic plan by using the same approach that US firms are 
employing with Mexico. ABB has purchased an equity position and is helping to set up a

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
 A major trend that has affected the thinking of corporate MNE strategists over the last dec-
ade or so is that of balancing a concern for economic integration with national responsive-
ness. Somewhat unfortunately, economic integration has been known as “globalization” in 
the literature in this ﬁ eld.   Globalization   can be deﬁ ned as the production and distribution 
of products and services of a homogeneous type and quality on a worldwide basis.       41  To a 
large extent, MNEs have homogenized tastes and helped to spread international consumer-
ism. For example, throughout North America, the wealthier nations of Europe, and Japan 
there has been a growing acceptance of standardized consumer electronic goods, automo-
biles, computers, calculators, and similar products. However, the goal of efﬁ cient economic 
performance through a universal globalization strategy has left MNEs open to the charge 
that they are overlooking the need to address national concerns. 
 National responsiveness   is the ability of MNEs to understand different consumer tastes 
in segmented regional markets and to respond to the different national standards and regu-
lations imposed by autonomous governments and agencies. Throughout the coming years, 
multinationals will continually have to deal with the twin goals of economic integration and 
national responsiveness. 42  See the case  International Business Strategy in Action: Kodak.   
  Integration versus national responsiveness 
 To reconcile the twin issues of integration and national responsiveness, transnational MNEs 
can analyze them conceptually through the use of  Figure   10.7   , which has been adapted from 
Bartlett 43  and Bartlett and Ghoshal. The vertical axis measures the need for globalization, 
frequently called “economic integration.” Movement up the axis results in a greater degree 
of economic integration, which generates economies of scale as a ﬁ rm moves into world-
wide markets, selling a single product or service. These economies are captured as a result 
of centralizing speciﬁ c activities in the value-added chain. They also occur by reaping the 
beneﬁ ts of increased coordination and control of geographically dispersed activities.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 Kodak 
 “You press the button, and we do the rest,” was Eastman 
Kodak’s slogan when it introduced the Kodak Brownie in 
1900. The user-friendly camera put photography within 
reach of the average person. Today, Kodak is recycling 
the slogan to promote its easy-to-use digital photography 
cameras. But this time, Kodak no longer has a sustainable 
technology-based firm-specific advantage in the market. 
Its old FSAs in development and film have been overtaken 
by the digital age. Its brand name, a surviving FSA, might 
just give it an edge against its competitors in the digital 
photography market. Indeed, Kodak filed for bankruptcy 
protection in January 2012. 
 Kodak pioneered digital cameras in 1976, but unlike 
Kodak’s early innovations, which mostly went unchal-
lenged, digital photography is turning out to be a battle 
ground for competitors, including electronics and com-
puter manufacturers like HP and Sony that have access 
to digital technology. In addition a number of upstarts have 
jumped into the market, including Ezonics and Vivitar, with 
lower-quality bargain cameras. 
 Slowly, but surely, digital photography has become the 
most popular form of recording images. Consumer reac-
tion to this new technology is yet to define the revenue gen-
eration model for producers. Traditionally, photographic 
companies derived revenues from selling cameras, but 
most importantly, from selling film and developing and 
printing photographs. Today, the digital camera user has a 
number of alternative printing methods, if he or she wants 
to print at all. 
 Consumers might choose to use one of two external 
printing options: take their memory card to an Internet 
kiosk to have prints developed, or send their picture files 
over the Internet to be printed and mailed back to them. 
Kodak’s retail network might give it a competitive advan-
tage if consumers can be convinced to drop by and use 
full-service or self-serve printing machines at their locations. 
If, however, consumers choose to do everything from 
home, sending photographs to a virtual kiosk that would 
then mail prints, upstarts might gain a hold in the better 
part of the market. 
 Kodak’s brand name, however, is likely to provide a 
significant advantage even on the Internet. If customers 
want to develop photos, they might just try  www.kodak.
com . That is, if Windows will allow it. Kodak’s collaboration 
with Microsoft became confrontational when Microsoft 
developed its own photo software that popped up auto-
matically when a camera chip was connected. The Windows 
software directed users to photo developers who paid fees 
to Microsoft. For Kodak, the consequences could be devas-
tating. The company needs to be able to enter the Web-
based printing market to make up for losing profits in its 
traditional film business. To add insult to injury Microsoft 
teamed up with Kodak’s archrival Fuji, listing it as one of 
the photo-developing service providers. Kodak complained 
to antitrust regulators.  
 Another consumer alternative is to print photographs 
at home using a regular color printer or a more special-
ized photograph printer available at many computer and 
office supplies stores. As similar things happen in the 
photographic industry, it would likely take revenues from 
traditional photographic companies to manufacturers of 
printer-friendly photographic paper, ink, cartridges, and 
toner. Will there be a spot left for Kodak to contribute in 
this market? The company certainly hopes so and has 
teamed up with computer companies such as HP and 
Lexmark to position itself should the market go this way. 
Yet, even this type of revenue generation is at risk since 
the European Commission began to investigate whether 
printer companies were illegally forcing consumers to 
purchase their ink, toners, and cartridges. 
 Perhaps the bleakest prediction for this industry is 
the near extinction of printing and developing revenue. 
Research shows that most people never print their digital 
photographs. Why would consumers print their photographs

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
if they can store them in a computer, save them on disks, 
and share them with family and friends around the world at 
no cost or at a negligible cost? It is likely that only a select 
few photographs will ever make it to paper. 
 Other types of revenue generation include the manufac-
turing and selling of cameras, digital camera software and 
compatible computer software, and photographic printing 
machines. Kodak has entered all of these markets, but 
whether it can be successful in all of them for the long run 
is still being decided. 
 Outside the digital wars, Kodak is consistently chal-
lenged by competitors in many other of its business 
lines. In 1997, Kodak and Fuji participated in a price war 
on traditional film that threatened to make film into a 
commodity. In the mid-1990s, Kodak pushed forth a case 
in the WTO claiming Japan’s trade regulations did not 
allow it to enter the Japanese market. This, it claimed, 
allowed Fuji to reduce profit margins in the US market, 
effectively dumping products. The WTO dismissed all 
charges. 
 Kodak’s traditional competitive advantages are being 
challenged by innovations that have increased the number 
of competitors and changed the rules of the game. Its 
brand name in photography now competes with other 
well-known brand names in the electronics industry for a 
market and revenue stream that is yet to be defined.

 The horizontal axis measures the need for corporations to be nationally responsive. 
Companies must address local tastes and government regulations, which may result in a 
geographic dispersion of activities or a decentralization of coordination and control for 
individual firms. 
 On the basis of the two axes in  Figure   10.7   , four situations can be distinguished. 
Quadrants 1 and 4 are the simplest cases. In quadrant 1, the need for integration is high 
and the need for awareness of sovereignty is low. This focus on economies of scale leads to 
competitive strategies that are based on price competition. In such an environment, mergers 
and acquisitions often occur. 
 The opposite situation is represented by quadrant 4, where the need for national 
responsiveness is high but the integration concern is low. In this case companies adopt 
products to satisfy the high demands of sovereignty and to ignore economies of scale 
because integration is not very important. 
 Quadrants 2 and 3 also reflect opposing situations. Quadrant 2 incorporates those cases 
where the need for both integration and national responsiveness is low. Both the poten-
tial to obtain economies of scale and the benefits of being sensitive to sovereignty are of 
little value. Typical strategies in quadrant 2 are characterized by increased international 
standardization of products and services. This can lead to lower needs for centralized qual-
ity control and centralized strategic decision making, while simultaneously eliminating 
requirements to adapt activities to individual countries. 
 In quadrant 3 the needs for integration and national responsiveness are both high. 
There is a strong need for integration in production, along with higher requirements 
for regional adaptations in marketing. Quadrant 3 is the most challenging and the one 
in which many successful “transnational” MNEs operate. Using this framework, we can 
analyze the impact of various exogenous policy shocks and trends on different industries, 
firms, banks, and other private-sector institutions. 
  The Lexus and the Olive Tree 
 This economic integration and national responsiveness matrix can also be applied to ana-
lyze the inﬂ uential book by Thomas Friedman on the Lexus and the Olive Tree.       44 Friedman 
uses the Lexus as a symbol for economic integration. In contrast, the Olive Tree is a sym-
bol for the historical, political, religious, and social aspects which present obstacles to eco-
nomic integration. Therefore, the logic of the Lexus view of globalization would ﬁ t on the 
vertical axis of  Figure   10.7    whereas the Olive Tree would be assigned to the horizontal axis 

318
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
representing the need for national responsiveness. Friedman himself discusses the extreme 
cases of the Lexus in quadrant 1 and the Olive Tree in quadrant 4. However, based on our 
analysis of  Figure   10.7    it is apparent that quadrant 3 represents another interesting case 
where both globalization and national responsiveness are equally important. The other 
point is that  Figure   10.7    is a strategy diagram to be put into operation by managers of 
MNEs (or other ﬁ rms). Therefore, it is the interpretation of the Lexus and the Olive Tree 
axes which is important for strategic management. A potential for strategy in quadrant 3 
would require that an MNE is able to organize itself to cope with both axes. 
 In his later work Friedman argues that the Olive Tree is no longer relevant and that only 
globalization matters. In his book  The World is Flat 45  Friedman shows that there are three 
types of globalization, the latest version of which is driven by the Internet and individual 
use of personal computers such that business can be done globally. Friedman calls this 
type of globalization 3.0. It has replaced globalization 2.0 which was led by MNEs and was 
organized at firm level rather than at individual level. In turn, this replaced globalization 
1.0 which existed from 1492 to 1800 in which labor costs and natural resources were drivers 
of international trade and finance and the world was organized at country level.   
 Balancing the trade-offs 
 MNEs in every industry apply the ideas in  Figure   10.7   , but they do so in a variety of ways. 
The following are select examples from three different industries: entertainment, personal 
computers, and automobiles. 
 Entertainment 
 One of the most successful entertainment ﬁ rms in the world is the Walt Disney Company. 
Its Disneyland Paris operation in France is a good example of how integration and national 
responsiveness are balanced. The park offers many of the same features (integration) found 
in Disney’s Orlando (Florida), Anaheim (California), and Tokyo operations, including 
amusement rides and cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Donald Duck. 
The company has recently expanded its European facilities along the lines of its MGM stu-
dios near Orlando. 46  Stressing uniformity among the geographically scattered parks, this 
integration focus is supplemented by national responsiveness that is designed to appeal 
to European visitors. English and French are the ofﬁ cial languages of the park, and mul-
tilingual guides are conversant in Dutch, German, Spanish, and Italian. A second example 
of national responsiveness is found in the international emphasis the company has given 
its Disney characters: Pinocchio is Italian, Cinderella is French, Peter Pan is British. At its 
movie theater in the park, Disney shows a European history ﬁ lm offering (in the United 
States, the ﬁ lm is a travelogue of America). 
 Another example of integration/national responsiveness is offered by Sega Enterprises, 
best known for its Sonic the Hedgehog video game character. Using computer simulation 
technology like that used to train airline pilots, Sega is developing small theme parks that 
will provide the same thrills as a roller coaster or a trip through space. By building a series 
of different amusement simulators, Sega intends to offer a wide array of “rides” without 
having to bear the expense of physically building the facilities. The idea is captured in the 
term  virtual reality , which means that participants experience the effects of a situation 
without literally being there. 47  “Scramble Training,” a Sega simulator that is part video and 
part movie, provides an example. This interactive game allows eight players to enter a small 
space capsule and take their position as pilot trainees. The captain appears on a screen in 
front of the simulator and gives orders to the players, who in turn launch the capsule and 
swerve through space, firing missiles and competing for points. When the captain is 
wounded, the controls are turned over to the player with the best score, who then steers 

319
CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
the capsule in for a landing. Sega intends to develop a host of different interactive simu-
lators that will allow it to compete with amusement parks such as Disney. (In fact, Sega’s 
concept is often referred to as “Disney in a Box.”) The simulators are uniform in design 
and construction, allowing the company to employ an integration emphasis. However, 
the types of games will vary from country to country (national responsiveness), depend-
ing on the entertainment interests of the local populace. For example, Sega has found that 
Americans are very sports oriented, so there is likely to be an opportunity for players to 
participate in a World Series baseball simulation. In Europe, this game would have little 
attraction, but many players there would like to participate in the World Cup soccer finals, 
so the company can modify its product characteristics to meet the needs of the customer. 48 
 Personal computers 
 Most personal computer (PC) makers compete on the bases of technology and price. They 
offer state-of-the-art machines and try to hold down their costs by outsourcing compo-
nents and improving assembly efﬁ ciency. This strategy is particularly important in mar-
kets such as Japan, where less than 25 percent of the population in the early 1990s owned 
PCs, and where local demands, such as the need to write in  kanji , had discouraged foreign 
competition. 
 In 2001, however, US firms have been making major headway in this market, thanks 
to their ability to exploit both integration and national responsiveness.       49  For example, 
Compaq and Dell have entered this market with low-priced units that were the same as 
those sold elsewhere (integration) but offered sharply lower prices (national responsive-
ness). As a result, both firms have been able to garner market share. IBM has employed a 
similar strategy in addition to addressing the desire of local customers to write in  kanji . The 
company has now perfected a bilingual version of Microsoft’s DOS, the standard operating 
system that controls approximately 80 percent of the world’s PCs. This version allows these 
machines to prepare or search documents with Japanese characters, the Western alphabet, 
or both. Apple is also having very good success in Japan, thanks to its willingness to adapt 
to local needs. For example, the company has a Japanese management team that has helped 
to surmount local barriers to “buying foreign.” It has also cultivated a strong network of 
dealers and worked to develop an image as an innovator, both of which are critical in the 
Japanese market. As a result of this careful balance of integration and national responsive-
ness, Apple and IBM alone account for almost 16 percent of the Japanese PC market in 
2001. With the merger of HP and Compaq, and IBM divestment by selling its PC business 
to Lenovo (China) in 2004, HP and Dell are active in the Japanese PC market. According 
to Mintel Market Navigator, HP is the fourth largest laptop PC provider in Japan with a 
market share of 7.3 percent whereas Dell had a modest market share of 2.7 percent by the 
middle of 2011. 50 
 Other US firms are also using a carefully formulated integration/national responsive-
ness strategy to gain market share. Microsoft has written a special version of Windows—
one of the most popular PC software programs of all time—for the Japanese market. Until 
1993, only 440,000 copies of the program had been sold, but when the company unveiled 
its newer version, more than 65,000 copies were snatched up in two days.       51 
 Automobiles 
 Every car manufacturer uses economic integration by producing autos that can be made and 
marketed around the world. In a few cases, the Volkswagen Beetle being the best example, 
a car will not need to be modiﬁ ed for the local market. 52  Usually, however, an integration 
strategy is complemented by national responsiveness in the form of design, engineering, 
and manufacturing changes. Ford’s Mondeo provides a good example. Developed for the 
world market, this car has uniform worldwide engineering standards with almost every 

320
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
speciﬁ cation expressed in the metric system. The company also has created uniform stand-
ards for raw materials, design, procurement, and manufacture of individual parts. Identical 
production tools are used at both European and US locations so that economies of scale can 
be maximized. At the same time, Ford has taken national responsiveness into consideration. 
European buyers prefer manual transmissions, whereas US buyers like automatic drive. 
Europeans demand cars that handle well, but this is not a priority issue with American 
customers. On the other hand, Americans want air-conditioned cars, and many Europeans 
do not. The overall cost of developing the Mondeo was $6 billion. However, initial sales in 
Europe were brisk and Ford believed it could maintain this momentum in the US market. 
It also believed it could create additional car models from the Mondeo program and thus 
develop a series of new offerings. If this is true, the integration and national responsiveness 
strategies used for the Mondeo will help smooth the way for future auto sales and help the 
company to recoup this enormous investment. 53 
 Honda offers another example of integration and national responsiveness strategies. 
The firm now builds a variety of different car sizes from one production platform by bend-
ing and stretching the autos to fit the demands of the market. As a result, Honda is able to 
build cars in the United States that are longer and roomier, while offering smaller, more 
compact models of the same car in Japan. The company is now using this same approach 
to build sports utility vehicles for the world market. 54 
 General Motors offers yet another example of integration and national responsiveness 
strategies. Like Ford, GM often develops cars for the European market, then introduces 
them into the United States. As a result, the cars are frequently identical in styling and 
design but have different features to accommodate local tastes. The Celta, a subcom-
pact offering in Brazil, has fewer features and 50 percent fewer parts than competitive 
models. In collaboration with its suppliers, GM created a modular assembly plant with 
just-in-time supplier delivery. Efficiency costs of such an integration strategy allowed for 
an inexpensive subcompact for developing markets, where price and reliability are most 
important. 55  When the auto is made in another developing market, it will be possible 
to build and assemble each unit quickly because the process will have been perfected in 
Brazil. This integration focus is complemented by national responsiveness. In Brazil, 
marketing of the Celta stresses security locks and anti-theft devices, whereas in safer 
developing countries, the car’s suspension system and handling on tough roads will 
receive more emphasis.  
  Competitiveness in the triad 
 From the viewpoint of MNEs, one of the most important business decisions regards the 
trade-off between integration and national responsiveness. Successful MNEs know they 
can no longer afford to ignore the latter and concentrate solely on globalization through 
economic integration. 
  In the United States 
 The United States experiences considerable decentralization in economic decision mak-
ing. It is a country in which subnational units continue to increase in importance. This 
issue should not be confused with pluralism. A variety of political opinions and parties is 
a strength of democracy. The problem arises when the institutional structure of the nation 
and its businesses cannot operate in an efﬁ cient manner, relative to global competitors. 
 The US Constitution was designed to allow Congress to be a broker for regional and 
special interests. On occasion, Congress works with the Executive branch to formulate 
and implement a coordinated economic policy and even a social policy. Examples of social 
reform and government economic activity in the Kennedy–Johnson years can be contrasted

with a return to more market-based principles and a somewhat reduced role for government 
in the Reagan years. 
 However, in many areas affecting the private sector today, the overwhelming character-
istic of doing business in the United States is the responsiveness of governments to special 
interest groups and lobbies. The more decentralized the level of government, the more 
responsive will be the regulatory activity to the lobbyist. On occasion businesses themselves 
can be lobbyists, but there are many other groups, such as environmentalists and social 
activists, who seem to be growing in power. Examples of conflicts in business lobbying 
occur in the areas of administration of US trade remedy laws and in the current US debate 
about the possible regulation of inward foreign direct investment (FDI). 
 Rugman and Anderson, 56  as well as others, have demonstrated that the current adminis-
tration of US countervailing duty (CVD) and antidumping (AD) laws is highly responsive 
to domestic producer interests and biased against foreign firms. US corporations use CVD 
and AD as a competitive strategy to erect entry barriers against rival firms.       57  Between 1980 
and 2003, US businesses filed 1,510 AD and CVD cases against foreign competitors with 
the US International Trade Commission; 37 percent of these cases, or 559, were found to 
be justified after the commission investigated the complaints.  Table   10.2    lists a number of 
selected products that were slapped with import tariffs. 
 Approximately 5 percent of all cases between 1980 and 2003 went against Canada.       58 
Thus, even when the US government was pursuing negotiations for free trade with Canada, 
individual US corporations were still using the CVD and AD laws to help restrict Canadian 
imports. This is a clear example of US national interests being offset by selective producer 
interests. There were more than 22 CVD and AD cases against Canada in the 1990s.       59 More 
of the same is in store in the future, although Canadian concerns about the administration 
of CVD and AD laws have been somewhat answered by the establishment of binational 
panels under the terms of the FTA and then NAFTA. 
 Another area of concern is inward FDI, which some congressional leaders now wish to 
restrict, and some Americans seem concerned with the growing amount of Japanese FDI. 
Some members of Congress have urged more screening of such FDI, and there is a strong 
“Japan-bashing” stance in US trade policy. Yet at the same time, state officials have been 
actively seeking Japanese FDI because they want the jobs and the tax base. This potential 
clash between Washington “beltway” thinking (anti-Japanese) and state-level activity (pro-
Japanese) parallels Canada’s experience with the regulation of FDI. 
 The United States seems destined in the next 10 years to repeat many of the mistakes 
made in Canada over the last 30 years. In 1974 the Trudeau government introduced the 
Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA), which was designed to screen FDI on econ-
omic criteria to assess whether there was a net benefit to Canada. Between 1974 and 1985,

FIRA responded to Ottawa’s political winds, at times rejecting as much as 30 percent of 
applications but at other times (especially 1982 to 1985) approving virtually everything.       60 
The administrators at FIRA and the responsible ministers made political decisions just as 
the US International Trade Commission and the US Commerce Department do today in 
US trade law cases.  
 In 1985, FIRA was abolished and a new agency, Investment Canada, was created with 
the mandate to attract FDI rather than scare it away.       61  This change in thinking about FDI 
came with a change in government, after the Progressive Conservatives were elected in 
1984 with a mandate of job creation. Throughout the lifetime of FIRA, most provinces, 
especially those in Atlantic Canada, wanted FDI for jobs and taxes. The clash between the 
provinces that favored FDI and the central Canadian economic nationalists led to the fed-
eral government giving up many of its powers to regulate FDI by buying into the agenda 
of the provinces, especially their overwhelming priority about jobs. Perhaps this is some 
evidence of the triumph of decentralized economic power. But a paradox emerges. In 
Canada, the economic nationalists who have used central government power are in retreat, 
whereas it appears that in the United States economic nationalism is just beginning to take 
off. If Japan bashing continues, then the US proponents of restrictions on FDI will have the 
same unhappy experience with FIRA as did Canada. Private-sector US corporate strategists 
will, therefore, need to respond to a large dose of economic nationalism and its associated 
protectionist inefficiencies. 
 In Eastern Europe 
 Another example of the use of sovereignty and the destruction of centralized economic 
power and values was the 1989 revolution in Central Europe and the collapse of the Soviet 
Union in 1991. The rejection of totalitarian communist regimes by the people of countries 
such as Romania, Belarus, and Russia has many implications for business. The key point is 
that these countries are very poor, with inefﬁ cient economic and ﬁ nancial systems. Their 
economic development will probably be through FDI rather than through joint ventures. 
Popular wisdom to the contrary, joint ventures between poor nations and wealthy corpo-
rations rarely work. The preferable mode of international business is FDI because Western 
ﬁ rms can then control their proprietary advantages and not risk dissipation through joint 
ventures. 62  Studies on joint ventures in developing countries have found a great deal of 
instability and failure. 63  Multinationals prefer FDI and countries such as India and Mexico, 
which once greatly restricted FDI, experienced inefﬁ cient economic development and 
eventually had to lift such regulations. This experience is relevant for Eastern Europe. 
 Doing business in Eastern Europe for the next 5–10 years will be dominated by the need 
for economic efficiency. The globalization concept will overwhelm concerns about adapt-
ing products for sovereignty. It is in the EU nations that national responsiveness will be 
important for corporations. In the wealthy triad powers, adapting to sovereignty matters; 
in the developing world and in Eastern Europe, economic efficiency is what matters.  
 In Japan 
 A key explanation for the success of Japanese MNEs is that they beneﬁ t from a highly cen-
tralized home-market economy. This has permitted Japan to use levers of industrial and 
strategic trade policies that could not be implemented successfully in the other areas of the 
triad. 
 Centralized government policy is critical to implementing effective corporate strategy.       64 
The Japanese cultural, religious, social, and political system is much more centralized in 
nature than other triad blocs, enabling the country’s MNEs to follow globalization strat-
egies. Thus, for example, after the two OPEC oil crises of the 1970s, Japanese industry was 
rapidly transformed out of shipbuilding, heavy engineering, and other energy-intensive 
PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES

323
CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
manufacturing and into computer-based manufacturing, consumer electronics, and high 
value-added services, including banking and finance. The government and the MNEs 
worked together to implement a new industrial strategy in an effective and efficient 
manner. 
 Such radical restructuring through industrial policy is unlikely to work in North 
America and Europe because of the decentralized nature of economic power. Attempts 
by the United States or Canada to implement a new industrial policy are likely to fail. 
Whatever government incentives and subsidies are made available will be appropriated 
by industries seeking shelter from competitors in the triad. To erect entry barriers against 
foreign competitors, companies will use the decentralized nature of the economic system. 
This has already occurred in the United States, with companies seeking protection from 
competitors through the use of CVD and AD laws. US steel, forest products, fish, and semi-
conductor industries, among others, have been using short-term legal remedies instead of 
investing in the development of sustainable, proprietary, firm-specific advantages. 
 What are the implications for corporate strategy of these asymmetrical developments in 
the triad? Japanese MNEs will continue to pursue an integration/globalization strategy, but 
they may face difficulties when they need to operate in the decentralized environments of 
North America and Europe, since marketing-type skills will become more important than 
production skills. Over the last decade, MNEs from Europe and North America have often 
abused the nature of their home-country decentralized systems, and sovereignty has hin-
dered efficient corporate development. However, MNEs from North America and Europe 
have a potential competitive advantage over Japanese MNEs if they can learn from their 
past mistakes. Awareness of sovereignty can make the former companies better equipped 
in the future to be more nationally responsive than their Japanese counterparts. Indeed, 
Japanese MNEs may become locked into a “globalization-only” strategy, just as the world 
begins to demand much more corporate responsiveness to sovereignty.

 How does ABB address the issues of globalization and national 
responsiveness? In each case, cite an example. 
 ABB addresses the issue of globalization by producing state-of-the-art products for world-
wide markets. It may be necessary to make modifications to address local geographic and 
climatic conditions, of course, but the basic technology and manufacturing techniques are 
similar. At the same time, ABB addresses national responsiveness by trying to be a local 
firm that is interested in the needs of that market. As a result, the company balances glo-
balization and sovereignty—a feat that most MNEs do not accomplish very well.   
 1   Porter’s single-diamond model is based on four country-specific determinants and two 
external variables (chance and government). This model is extremely useful in examin-
ing strategies among triad and other economically developed countries. However, when 
applying the model to smaller, open, trading economies, a modification is in order.

American market and to integrate itself into this overall market. This requires the use of

a “double-diamond” model for corporate strategy, resulting in Canadian firms develop-
ing competitive capabilities that allow them to compete successfully with US firms in 
the United States. This is being done by (a) developing innovative products and services 
that simultaneously meet the needs of the US and Canadian customer, (b) drawing on 
the support industries and infrastructure of both the US and Canadian diamonds, and 
(c) making free and full use of the physical and human resources in both countries.  
 3   Mexico’s economic success also depends on its ability to integrate itself into the North 
American market. However, this strategy is different from that of the Canadians because 
Mexico does not have the FDI to invest in the US market. Much of its linkage is a result of 
low labor costs that allow the country to produce inexpensive goods and export them into 
the United States. The North American Free Trade Agreement worked out with the United 
States and Canada in 1993 will determine part of Mexico’s future economic success.  
 4   A major trend that has affected the thinking of corporate MNE strategists over the past 
10 years is balancing a concern for economic integration and globalization with that of 
national responsiveness. Many MNEs have focused on integration without giving suf-
ficient attention to the sovereignty issue. However, there will have to be a reversal of this 
trend and MNEs will have to become much more interested in national responsiveness 
if they hope to succeed in overseas markets.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
 REAL CASE 
 There is no global beer, only local 
 Beer is a good example of an industry that is local, not glo-
bal. Indeed, beer is stubbornly local. Because beer is bulky 
and too expensive to export, it is brewed domestically; foreign 
producers will license their brand name products to local 
producers to gain a local market presence. In ad dition, 
imports of alcoholic beverages are traditionally heavily taxed. 
Rival domestic producers usually tie up local distribution 
channels. Governments also protect domestic breweries, 
such as in Germany, where the Reinheitsgebot purity rules 
have protected indigenous beer for over 400 years. 
 In Canada, domestic brewers were exempted from the 
national treatment provision of the United States–Canada 
Free Trade Agreement of 1989 (and later from NAFTA in 
1993). The reason is that, initially, each Canadian company 
needed to have a brewery in each province, resulting in 
rather small and inefficient breweries in the low-population 
Atlantic provinces. In light of such inefficiency and import 
protection, Labatt was taken over by the Belgian brewery, 
InBev, Molson has merged with Coors. 
 The local, fragmented nature of the brewing industry 
can be offset by acquisitions. The half-dozen leading 
world brewers are constantly attempting to increase their 
market share in both developed and developing countries. 
Belgium’s InBev has made huge gains in the world market, 
buying up such companies as Bass Brewers of the UK, 
Becks of Germany, Labatt in Canada, Anheuser-Busch in 
the United States, and others. South African Breweries 
(SAB) merged with Miller. The new company, SABMiller, 
is now the world’s number two brewer.  Table   1    lists the 
world’s largest brewers. 
 There are a few premium “designer” beers (high-end 
beers that have been developed into global brands), but 
they are usually produced under license. This has led to 
cross-licensing and distribution arrangements as well as 
to mergers and acquisitions. Today there is some con-
solidation in this segment to a few large brewers such 
as Heineken, InBev. But the premium lager segment is 
a minority of the total world beer market, which still has 
mainly local beer.  
 Anheuser-Busch (in St. Louis, the United States) used 
to be the world’s largest beer company and sold 90 per-
cent of its Budweiser brand in the United States, a local 
beer. On July 13, 2008, Belgian brewing company InBev 
completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch for US 
$52 billion dollar in equity, creating the world’s largest beer 
company, Anheuser-Busch InBev. It has a portfolio of well 
over 200 beer brands. These include global flagship brands 
Budweiser, Stella Artois and Beck’s; multi-country brands, 
such as Leffe and Hoegaarden; and many local cham pions, 
such as Bud Light, Skol, Brahma, Quilmes, Michelob, 
Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske 
and Jupiler. In 2009, its total sales were US $36.758 billion, 
of which 45.79 percent was generated in North America, 
22.61 percent in Latin America—North, 5.61 percent in 
Latin America—South, 12.75 percent in Western Europe, 
7.37 percent in Central and Eastern Europe, and 5.87 per-
cent in Asia–Pacific. The Belgian brewery has aggressively 
gone the farthest in expanding from its EU base into North 
America since the 1990s. It purchased Canada’s largest 
brewer, Labatt, in 1993. The Company also produces and 
distributes soft drinks, particularly in Latin America. 
 In 2009, the Dutch brewery company Heineken generates 
a revenue of US $20.490, of which 52.89 percent of its sales 
is within Western Europe, another 21.65 percent from 
Central and Eastern Europe, only 10.48 percent from the 
Americas, 12.29 percent from the Middle East and Africa, 
and the remainder, 2.69 percent, from Asia–Pacific. 
 According to the UK-based researcher Plato Logic World 
Beer Report 2009, the world’s four biggest brewers 
Anheuser-Busch InBev, London listed SABMiller, Heineken, 
and Denmark’s Carlsberg accounted for over half of the

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 IBM 
 In 1911, four recording and processing equipment manufac-
turers in the United States merged to form the Computer-
Tabulating-Recording Company (C-T-R). The new company 
merged its Canadian operations in 1917 under the name of 
International Business Machines Company. This name was 
adopted by all the company’s operations in 1924; today, 
most people simply recognize it as IBM. 
 A pioneer of the personal computer (PC), IBM is also 
well known for leading the way to globalization. However, 
the computer industry is at a mature stage of manufactur-
ing. Eventually in 2004, IBM got out of personal computers 
altogether, selling the business to China’s Lenovo as PC 
becomes commoditized. 
Today, its operations span more than 200 countries with a 
total 309,499 employees worldwide and its research labora-
tories are located in nine countries across the triad. Indeed,  
according to Rugman 2005, IBM is the largest of only nine 
“global” companies in the  Fortune  500. In 2009, IBM’s reve-
nue was US $95.758 billion and it derived 42.04 percent of all 
its revenue from the Americas, compared to 31.93 percent 
from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa and 23.22 percent 
from Asia–Pacific. The remaining 2.80 percent of its revenue 
comes from its uncategorized global operations. 
 Production is also spread around the world. Product 
lines are clustered in regions that offer plentiful labor or 
specialized technology, depending on the nature of the 
product. ThinkPads used to be manufactured in Shenzhen, 
China, desktops in Guadalajara, Mexico. This reliance on 
developing countries allows IBM to take advantage of low 
labor costs while placing it inside some of the fastest-
growing markets in the world.  
 IBM was an international company at its conception. 
C-T-R had brought together the international operations of

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE STRATEGY AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
all its predecessors. In the decades following its establish-
ment, the company aggressively pursued expansion across 
the world. In Latin America, an office opened in Brazil 
in 1917. Within the next 20 years, IBM secured contracts 
with governments and corporations in Argentina, Mexico, 
Ecuador, Chile, Cuba, Uruguay, and Peru. In Asia, the com-
pany opened its first office in Bombay, India, in 1920. The 
Philippine market was entered in 1925, followed the next 
year by the first IBM equipment being installed in Osaka, 
Japan, for the Nippon Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 
China, the first IBM machines were installed at the Peking 
Union Medical College in 1934. 
 IBM’s entry into the European market started when a 
branch of the International Time Recording Company, an 
IBM forerunner, opened in France in 1914. It was only in 
1919 that a consolidated IBM was introduced in Europe. In 
the 1920s and 1930s, IBM manufacturing facilities sprang 
up in Germany, France, England, and Italy. 
 Although IBM’s organizational segments are product 
based, a company sales and distribution segment has 
a geographic focus as well as a specialized and global 
industry focus. Small and medium business contracts are 
dealt with through a global sales and distribution segment. 
Its foreign subsidiaries share technology, logistics, busi-
ness principles, and a common source of manufacturing, 
but have the power to implement local strategies. In other 
words, they can choose their product lines and marketing 
strategy to respond to the needs of the local environment, 
including regulations, customer tastes, income levels, and 
the competitive environment. 
 In terms of production, IBM’s highest commitment to 
globalizing production is its growing reliance on electronic 
manufacturing service providers. More than two-thirds of 
the company’s Intel-based products are manufactured in 
worldwide factories by contract manufacturers, including 
Sanmina-SCI and Solectron. (See the Flextronics Case 
Study,  Chapter 12 .) 
 IBM is one of only a few companies that have successfully 
penetrated foreign regional markets in terms of revenues 
and production. A main reason is that the computer, 
office, and electronics industry in which IBM operates 
is one of the most global, with average intra-regional 
sales of 56.2 percent. Electronics are easy to transport 
and are standardized across all world regions. Seven of 
the nine global firms are from this industry. This extra-
regionality is the result of standardized components that 
can be transported cheaply across the world, allowing for 
a global supply chain. 
 In terms of assets, however, IBM is highly intra-
regional; 62.9 percent are in the United States. There 
are a number of reasons for this: (1) foreign production 
facilities are often owned by contract manufacturers; 
(2) the cost of land and equipment is higher in the United 
States than in many of the developing countries in which 
the company manufactures; and (3) the United States 
remains the most important market for IBM. Indeed, 
although IBM has over 20 percent of its sales in each triad 
market, the Americas continue to account for the largest 
portion. It is difficult to argue that this is merely the result 
of a home-region advantage. The United States is, after 
all, the largest triad economy and the largest market for 
technology products.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Innovation is the lifeblood of any firm, large or small. By persistently 
creating new and better products and services, new production 
processes, management practices, and business models, they can 
stay ahead of the competition. Multinational firms have an added 
competitive advantage. By continually recombining resources, assets, 
and capabilities from different locations to meet the changing needs 
of clients and customers in different markets around the world, 
multinational firms have the scale, scope, and diversity of options to 
out-innovate local rivals. 
 Small firms lack these scale and scope advantages but can 
still benefit from a diversity of options for sourcing inputs and 
accessing markets, if they internationalize. They arguably face 
greater challenges and risks than large firms when they do expand 
abroad. Those that succeed against the odds provide lessons for all 
entrepreneurs and innovators. 
 By connecting the above themes in this chapter, our specific 
objectives are to: 
 1  Understand  the international dimensions of innovation, for large 
and small firms. What innovation advantages can firms gain from 
being international, in theory and practice?  
 2  Examine  how companies in various industries can organize 
different kinds of innovation activity in different locations, to derive 
particular benefits.  
 3  Analyze  small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a 
particular focus on why and how they internationalize, the practical 
challenges they face, and the kinds of theories that help explain 
why they venture beyond their own national borders.  
 4  Explain , using concepts such as dynamic capabilities, born global 
and born regional, entrepreneurial life cycles, networks, and 
industry clusters, what differentiates success from failure for 
international and innovative small firms.

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
 For a firm recently valued at $50 billion yet with just over 
2,000 employees and only 14 offices in countries outside of 
the United States, Facebook cannot be classed as one of 
the big multinationals. But it has grown to earn estimated 
revenues of over $2 billion annually and host over 600 mil-
lion active users from virtually no income or users in 2006 
when it opened up its membership to the world. 
 It is also amongst a growing breed of business enter-
prises which have captured the imagination of many 
observers, partly because they appear to offer a quick 
route to personal riches. The founder, Mark Zuckerberg, 
was said to be the youngest billionaire in history and 
replaced Bill Gates as the role model for budding entre-
preneurs globally. Facebook was created by Zuckerberg 
at Harvard, in 2004, and its genesis (involving computer 
hacking, lawsuits, and now famously broken friendships) 
became the subject of an Oscar-winning film,  The Social 
Network , in 2010. 
 Like other online enterprises, its phenomenal growth 
is based primarily on the way it can connect customers 
globally. It offers a platform for individuals and groups to 
interact and share experiences, particularly through shar-
ing pictures, news, and friends. Users can also communicate 
with each other through Chat, personal messages, Wall 
posts, Pokes, or Status Updates. 
 Some argue that online social media networks like 
Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube are a new form of trust-
based social engagement which marketers can benefit 
from. They can do this by building “relationships” with 
customers rather than streaming generic advertising 
messages at them. In this way customers can also become 
co-creators of products and services, as user feedback is 
built directly into the innovation process. These are impor-
tant issues for Facebook as its revenues come primarily 
from advertising, but it still only earns about the same per 
year that Google earns each month. This has put pressure 
on the firm to gradually open up its online environment 
to commercial interests to try to leverage the size of the 
network for additional revenue. 
 Other business-related uses of Facebook include recruit-
ment, although professional networks such as LinkedIn 
are better suited to this, and as a mechanism for firms 
to access outside expertise and knowledge as inputs into 
their own innovation and marketing challenges. 
 Over 70 percent of the platform’s users are outside 
of the United States and it is seen to be the top social 
network platform across a number of country markets 
including: the United States, the UK, Canada, Australia, the 
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, 
Hong Kong, and Vietnam. Table 1 shows the top 10 countries 
in terms of users.    
 Other platforms dominate in other markets, including 
Mixi.jp in Japan, Google-owned Orkut in India, RenRen in 
China, Vkontakte in Russia, CyWorld in South Korea, and 
Yahoo!’s Wretch.cc in Taiwan. Globally some of the larg-
est competitors to Facebook include Twitter, Myspace and 
Gmail (Google), Habbo, and Tencent QQ. The latter, Chinese 
network is said to have the most users of all, around 
700 million. But Facebook has made some inroads into 
these markets recently, in its drive to become the leading 
global social networking site. Orkut, for example, is losing 
ground to Facebook in terms of registered users in India. 
Vkontakte and RenRen, however, appear to be benefitting 
from a number of location-specific advantages in their 
respective countries. These include specialized local lan-
guage characters (Russian Cylliric and Simplified Chinese), 
investment in local content, and (particularly in the case of 
RenRen) a degree of government-supported protectionism. 
 Since 2009 Facebook has expanded internationally in 
a more traditional sense, through foreign direct invest-
ment, establishing its international HQ in Dublin, Ireland 
and offices in Hamburg, Hong Kong, Hyderabad, London, 
Madrid, Milan, Paris, Selangor, Singapore, Stockholm, 
Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto. 
 The Dublin-based hub provides advertisers and users 
with service and support in their native languages across 
the region. According to the director of online operations in

CHAPTER 11 INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND “BORN GLOBAL” FIRMS
Dublin (recruited from Google to establish this subsidiary), 
the aim is to “meet user needs in a localized and speedier 
way across Europe.” In 2010 staff levels were increased to 
over 200 across the advertising sales, account manage-
ment, and platform operations divisions, as the regional 
hub’s role was extended. 
 In addition to the global nature of its user base, the firm 
benefits from a large and very international network of 
entrepreneurs and developers, from more than 190 countries, 
who build with Facebook Platform. One of the software 
programs most widely used by third-party developers is the 
translation tool, for localizing Facebook globally. So, both its 
“supplier-inputs,” in terms of the knowledge and expertise 
that develop its online services, and its “customer-outputs,” 
in terms of the services themselves, are more global than 
the firm’s distribution of assets, sales, or employees would 
suggest.

 Innovation 
 The renewal and 
enlargement of the range of 
products and services and 
the associated markets; 
the establishment of new 
methods of production, 
supply and distribution; the 
introduction of changes 
in management, work 
organization, and the 
working conditions and 
skills of the workforce    
 In this chapter we examine the connected themes of innovation, entrepreneurship, small 
international ﬁ rms, and “born global” ﬁ rms.   Innovation can simply be thought of as “the 
successful exploitation or commercialization of new ideas.” But an expanded and more use-
ful deﬁ nition is: “the renewal and enlargement of the range of products and services and 
the associated markets; the establishment of new methods of production, supply and dis-
tribution; the introduction of changes in management, work organization, and the working 
conditions and skills of the workforce.” 1 
 All firms, regardless of their size, have to innovate to survive. Where firms locate 
innovation-related activities is of growing interest to managers, policymakers, and inter-
national business researchers. Moreover, the ways in which multinational firms link and 
integrate inputs (specialist knowledge, capabilities, and ideas as well as assets and other 
resources) from various locations and connect these with market opportunities elsewhere 
is an increasingly important part of the “performance puzzle.” The management of inno-
vation and the location of innovation activities not only differentiate firms in terms of their 
performance, but have a significant impact on foreign direct investment flows and patterns 
of regional employment and development. 
 Entrepreneurship and innovation go hand-in-hand. Entrepreneurs, whether they are 
working in small or large firms, as owner-managers or employees, are distinctive because 
they have the capability and motivation to pursue innovative commercial opportunities 
that are riskier and more radical than normal. They identify such opportunities and assemble 
the resources and capabilities needed to create value. 
 “Born global” is a term used to describe a firm that is, from its beginnings, immediately 
or very quickly reliant on a global presence to survive and succeed. Leveraging particular

firm-specific advantages (FSAs), such as new technologies, unique products or services, 
or a valuable capability derived from one or more locations, such firms serve customers 
locally or globally. We could say that the very existence of born global firms is due to their 
position as international entrepreneurial “brokers,” exploiting commercial opportunities 
that arise from bridging resource inputs and market niches in different global locations. 
However, the precise, defining characteristics of born global firms are the subject of some 
debate in international business studies, as we discuss below.  
 A major deﬁ ning feature of multinational enterprises (MNEs) is that they manage busi-
ness operations across a range of country contexts, each of which represents a different set 
of opportunities for innovation, in two speciﬁ c ways. First, a distinctive set of market 
opportunities, which offer the potential for an MNE to sell customized products and services 
to particular groups of customers across a variety of market locations. Second, country 
locations offer a unique set of resources, or inputs into the innovation process, including 
scientiﬁ c and technological assets and capabilities, or expertise and knowledge in R&D, 
engineering, or design, at a particular price. By continually linking innovation input oppor-
tunities and output opportunities, multinational enterprises, regardless of their size, are to 
a greater or lesser extent entrepreneurial. 
 National contexts vary in terms of their economic, social, cultural, political, and institu-
tional characteristics and this variety underpins both of these kinds of innovation oppor-
tunity. These factors influence the kinds of resources and capabilities that are available in a 
particular location and the kinds of customers and markets that develop there. Studies also 
show how different forms of competitive advantage at the national, industry, and firm lev-
els stem from the particular characteristics of the   national innovation system (NIS) . 2 The 
quality of local scientific, technological, design-related, and creative expertise, combined 
with institutional relationships between enterprises, universities, and government research 
organizations, underpins this competitiveness. These are one form of country-specific 
advantage (CSA) that supports the development of firm-specific advantages (FSAs). Firms 
that evolve in regions with high-quality capabilities and institutions benefit from this by 
gaining competitive advantages that help them expand internationally. These location 
endowments also make such locations attractive to other firms engaged in FDI. 
 These issues have long been of concern for policymakers in OECD countries, where 
almost all R&D activity used to be located. However, as discussed in  Chapter 20 , emerging 
economies are growing in importance as a source of innovation and as a preferred location 
for R&D investment. 
 As more firms become more international the networks and processes for innovating 
also become more global. The section in  Chapter 12  on “Research, Development and 
Innovation,” introduces process innovation and product/service innovation as two key 
forms of innovation managed by firms. It also examines how global R&D networks help 
companies tap into local sources of scientific and technological expertise and integrate 
these to develop new or improved products, services, and processes. 
  Figure   11.1    outlines some of the main drivers for internationalization in relation to 
innovation in MNEs. The two main forms of internationalization, “market-seeking” and 
“resource-seeking,” are referred to elsewhere in this book. Very often they go hand-in-
hand, because local specialists, whether engineers, plant managers, distribution specialists, 
or customer-relationship managers, are usually the best-equipped to customize processes, 
products, and services to local conditions. Local assets and knowledge need to be leveraged 
to develop or adapt products and services for local customers.

 As discussed elsewhere in this book, multinational enterprises have to cope with the com-
peting pressures of integration and responsiveness. That is, to derive beneﬁ ts such as economies 
of scale from the integration and standardization of their operations globally while at the 
same time customizing and adapting in response to local customers and contexts. 
 As shown in  Figure  11.2 , adapted from the groundbreaking work of Christopher 
Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal, we can also feature innovation in this balancing act. In 
theory, some innovation activities should be centralized and/or standardized and some 
should be de-centralized and/or customized (or “localized”). We find this is also the case 
in practice, as described below. 3 
 A second framework, developed by Nohria and Ghoshal, extends this logic by describ-
ing several archetypal MNE structures for managing different kinds of innovation.       4 
 Figure   11.3    shows this basic typology, differentiating between three generic forms of 
innovation activity: sensing, responding and implementing. The framework shows how 
it may be appropriate either to separate or to combine these three activities, depending 
on industry conditions and the product or service in question.  
 In some industries, such as semiconductors, heavy engineering, or pharmaceuticals, 
innovation is predominantly technology-driven, rather than market-driven. This is nor-
mally because the needs of customers are clear cut (faster processors, stronger bridges, or 
a cure for cancer) but difficult to achieve. Moreover, there are strong economies of scale 
in centralization of R&D and innovation efforts to achieve scientific or technological 
breakthroughs ahead of competitors. Sensing opportunities for innovation, like new drug 
compounds to cure known diseases or faster semiconductor chip designs, and responding 
to these by allocating capital investment and putting together dedicated project teams,

will tend to happen at one location. This specialist unit or “center of excellence” may also 
implement the innovation by developing and launching the product for sale around the 
world. This is referred to as “  center-for-global  ” in the framework, in cases where the new 
technology or product is developed centrally but can be used at the local level. Nohria and 

337
CHAPTER 11 INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND “BORN GLOBAL” FIRMS
Ghoshal use the example of telecoms switching systems, which have clear-cut technology 
development drivers and obvious economies of scale in R&D, making it appropriate for 
firms to focus resources and efforts in central R&D units. These create fairly standard 
components which can be used in telecoms networks around the world. 
 For market-seeking internationalization it may be appropriate for the local subsidiaries 
of a firm to sense the opportunity or need for product or service changes to suit local pref-
erences. Headquarters may then allocate to these subsidiaries the discretionary decision-
making powers and the resources and capabilities to respond to these opportunities 
and implement changes to existing products or services, for the local market. These are 
labeled “  local-for-local  ” innovations, where new or customized products and services are 
entirely developed by local subsidiaries because they suit the specific characteristics of the 
local market or country conditions. 
 “ Local-for-global  ” is where a locally developed product or service turns out to fit 
other markets beyond the location of the subsidiary responsible for creating it. Nohria and 
Ghoshal describe how Unilever gave its Indian subsidiary the remit for developing a new 
kind of clothes detergent to improve sales across the country. Because many people in India 
washed clothes by hand in rivers, a local team designed a soap bar with the same detergent 
properties as soap powders (which had the inconvenient tendency to drift downstream and 
wash someone else’s clothes!). This became a big-selling brand in India and then proved 
popular in developing countries in other parts of the world for the same reasons. 
 The fourth typology, “  global-for-global  ,” is seen as the “ideal” organization structure 
for “transnational” corporations (as opposed to multinational corporations). Here firms 
pool inputs, including resources, knowledge, and capabilities, in response to changing 
technological and market opportunities globally. By effectively coordinating their many 
subsidiaries around the world, transnational companies can leverage the advantages 
of their size (scale advantages) and diversity (scope advantages), integrating specialist 
assets and expertise in response to their changing competitive environments. Nohria and 
Ghoshal also call this ideal organizational form the “differentiated network,” building on 
previous studies of multinational networks. 5  
  The innovative MNE as a differentiated network 
 MNEs, large and small, have to both adapt to local conditions and optimize their scale and 
scope advantages by standardizing products, services, brands, and organizational practices 
as much as possible. Hence, they face the dilemma of having to be both “global” and “local” 
at the same time. But one of the major natural competitive advantages of MNEs results from 
their ability to combine (and continually recombine) various inputs (particularly knowl-
edge and expertise) into the innovation process, from different locations, to serve different 
customer needs across a variety of markets. Their ability to exploit this advantage depends 
to a signiﬁ cant degree on how they are structured to manage networks which connect these 
locations and incentivize specialists to connect across these networks to add value. 6 
 Differentiated networks require strong integrative and dynamic capabilities to operate 
effectively. Not only must they integrate disparate resources and knowledge from the various 
parts of the firm, but they must also continually develop and recombine these assets in response 
to the complex and changing range of external innovation opportunities. In theory this is 
straightforward, in practice there are many organizational barriers and constraints to resource 
and knowledge-sharing. Moreover, which opportunities should be targeted and which areas of 
resource-allocation or knowledge-development should be prioritized is continually contested. 
 Firms that do develop more effective ways of integrating specialist knowledge for inno-
vation tend to have a degree of “slack” in their configuration of assets, resources, and exper-
tise. Clayton Christensen notes this in his analysis of how firms become locked into certain 
sets of markets, resources, and capabilities by focusing on cost-cutting and efficiency. Over

time they lose the flexibility to explore and experiment and innovate their way on to a new 
“S-curve.” 7  Firms that operate as dynamic networks also balance the division of decision–
making responsibility for innovation between headquarters (the centre) and subsidiaries (the 
periphery) and develop organizational mechanisms, such as project structures, incentives, 
communication channels, IT systems, roles, and responsibilities for connecting specialist 
sources of knowledge around the firm and leveraging these to serve clients and customers. 
 Research has shown how and why firms differ in their “integrative” innovation capabil-
ities. Sony, for example, in comparison with counterparts like Panasonic (formerly known 
as Matsushita) and Philips, has a strong set of organization coordination mechanisms, 
communication practices, and employee incentives for connecting market opportunities 
with technological potential in its consumer electronics division. 8  This involves combining 
software and hardware specialists to create new functionalities in multimedia products and 
linking them effectively with consumers to develop some expertise in what drives patterns 
of adoption and use. Rather than relying on the marketing function to produce data and 
analysis on customers, Sony tends to encourage engineers and technologists to observe or 
work with customers directly to understand what kinds of innovation add value for them. 
 Compared to other Japanese firms Sony is fairly unusual in its so-called “  ambidexterity .” 
That is, its ability “to be aligned and efficient in its management of today’s business demands 
while simultaneously being adaptive to changes in the environment.”       9  Sony is continually com-
ing up with new technology platforms (CDs, DVDs, minidisks, and so on) and new products 
based around these platforms. But it also invests in improving current product lines, with new 
models and new features, and it strives to make them cheaper through economies of scale 
and continuous improvement in manufacturing. Many Japanese firms are renowned for their 
incremental process and product innovation capabilities, but are weaker in terms of their radical 
or R&D-driven innovation. Moreover, they tend to be more locked into domestic market R&D 
and innovation networks, compared to counterparts from the United States or Europe.       10   
 The original studies leading to the concept of the differentiated network focused predomi-
nantly on manufacturing firms, but as innovation in multinational networks has become more 
widely analyzed, knowledge-based services and other business sectors have also been examined.       11

 What limits Facebook’s ability to become the dominant platform in every 
country market and how might this change in the future? 
 The Facebook platform has the advantage of massive positive network externalities. That is, as 
more people use the platform, the greater the value to other users. However, it is still subject 
to the same local market constraints, such as government regulations and protection, local 
suppliers and network infrastructure, culture, and language that limit the global spread of 
any standard product or service. Its origins, structure, in-built culture, and current (Western-
dominated) membership give it a “liability of foreignness” that local versions do not have. There 
are a number of ways this might change in the future. The least likely is a standardization (or 
“Americanization”?) of local cultural preferences, removing one major barrier to global domi-
nance. There is in fact evidence of a rejection of a uniform set of global values and beliefs and a 
resurgence of local cultures. The alternative future may lie in the adaptation of Facebook itself 
into a more diversified range of locally shaped platforms, interfaces, and membership groups. 
By balancing the global and the local, Facebook may evolve into a true transnational corpo-
ration. However, advertisers, who drive revenues and therefore have a strong influence over 
the strategic direction taken by the firm, will be more interested in some markets than others.

with an introduction to SMEs (small-and-medium-sized enterprises) and returning to the 
topic of innovation later in the chapter.

 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Between the summer of 2010 and early 2011 an IBM 
computer named “Watson” challenged and eventually 
beat other (human) contestants on the US game-show 
“Jeopardy!” It was seen to be a step-change in comput-
ing intelligence and a demonstration of the excellence of 
IBM’s global R&D network. The computer, named after 
an IBM research lab and two of the firm’s original foun-
ders, Thomas J. Watson Sr. and his son Thomas J. Watson 
Jr., can understand natural language and find answers to 
real questions across a wide range of subject areas. Built 
by linking 90 servers using IBM’s “DeepQA architecture,” 
it is the result of years of work by the company’s leading 
researchers and is now being deployed as a support tool in 
healthcare, finance, and customer services. 
 IBM has long been a dominant global force in science 
and technology development. In 2010 the company was 
awarded more US patents (5,896) than any other com-
pany, for the 18th consecutive year. Over 70 percent of 
these were for software and services. The firm invests 
around $6 billion in R&D annually, resulting in intel-
lectual property (IP) income of about $1 billion each year 
as well as a stream of new technologies, products, and 
services. 
 In 2008 the incoming director of R&D at IBM, John 
Kelly, embarked on a restructuring program in response 
to both the development of new R&D competitors, such as 
Microsoft and Google, and new opportunities in emerging 
economies. This took the lead from CEO Sam Palmisano 
who had a clear view of what a “globally integrated 
enterprise” should look and act like: “a new kind of 
enterprise which is best understood as global rather than 
multinational.” Kelly visited the eight IBM research labs 
around the world, including China, India, and Israel, to 
gain insights from the firm’s global workforce of 3,200 
researchers. On the basis of this, he decided to further 
internationalize the company’s R&D structure and consoli-
date the fragmented allocation of resources into larger-
scale, leading projects. Both of these strategies have been 
seen by insiders as signaling a shift from the traditional 
US-based R&D centers to new initiatives in emerging 
economies. The firm has since added a 10th R&D lab, in 
Brazil, to its worldwide portfolio and is planning another 
lab in Australia (see    table 1   ).  
 Global alliances and collaboration are also a central part 
of the strategy. Kelly uses the term “  collaboratories ” to 
denote “agile, in-market research” activities which connect 
with universities and science and technology institutes in dif-
ferent countries, rather than investing in large-scale brick-
and-mortar laboratories. Significantly, this also means 
conducting research closest to the problem. For example, 
instead of tackling transportation issues in the United 
States, where the infrastructure is in line with growth, he 
suggests that IBM will focus on a country, city, and area 
where road traffic is a primary problem, such as Mumbai. 
 IBM has developed a number of unique networking 
mechanisms for connecting researchers and employees 
for innovation. It holds a “smart camp” and uses Facebook 
to host discussions between its in-house researchers and 
other experts around the world. “Jams” or “jamming” are 
another unusual way the firm promotes technology-based 
creativity. These are online brainstorming sessions for 
huge numbers of people to share ideas and discuss key 
challenges which can be commercial or related to social 
or environmental issues. In 2006 the “Innovation Jam” 
connected over 150,000 people from 104 countries and 
67 companies. Ten new IBM businesses were launched 
as a result, with seed investment totaling $100 million. 
An Innovation Jam in 2008 demonstrated how powerful 
“crowd-sourcing” for new ideas could be. Since then IBM 
has coordinated online Jams on governance, technology, 
and security. In 2011 the Prince of Wales in the UK kicked-
off “Start Jam” focusing on sustainable business practices. 
 Some of the IBM’s global networking efforts are clearly, 
at least in part, public relations exercises. But it has obvi-
ously developed a sophisticated range of networks and 
organization mechanisms to connect and leverage the 
huge range of in-house R&D expertise it has invested in 
and simultaneously tap into external sources of knowledge 
and capabilities for innovation.

 Studying small international ﬁ rms provides a useful contrast to large multinational ﬁ rms, 
which are the focus of much of this book. Comparisons particularly reveal the importance 
of scale and scope as sources of certain kinds of competitive advantages for international-
i zation, as outlined by Alfred Chandler. 12  Small ﬁ rms have neither the manpower nor the 
ﬁ nancial resources to spread their options geographically or make many mistakes when 
they take the ﬁ rst steps into new markets. This means that they have to be particularly 
entrepreneurial, innovative, and adaptive when expanding abroad. 13 
 In the sections that follow we focus on some of the defining characteristics of small and 
international firms and examine some of the challenges they face in relation to their inter-
national expansion. After a brief overview of small firms outlining their general economic 
importance, we will examine how and why they extend their businesses outside their home

markets. We will also discuss various theories of international new ventures and how both 
dynamic and innovation-related capabilities are key elements for their survival. Finally, 
some of the practical challenges for internationalizing SMEs are described. 
  What are small firms? 
 Each country tends to have a different legal deﬁ nition of “small,” sometimes depending on 
the industry in question. The Small Business Administration in the United States gener-
ally speciﬁ es a small business as having fewer than 500 employees for manufacturing busi-
nesses and less than $7 million in annual revenues for most non-manufacturing businesses. 
This contrasts the European Union deﬁ nition where a small ﬁ rm generally has less than 50 
employees, a micro-enterprise has less than 10 employees, and a medium-sized ﬁ rm has less 
than 250. See  Table  11.1 for some selected comparisons. 
 In the United States, small businesses account for around half the GDP and more than 
half the employment. In the EU the term   small-and-medium-sized enterprise (SME) 
is commonly used and these account for 99 percent of all firms, 65 percent of jobs, and 
about 58 percent of turnover, compared to 69 percent of jobs and 53 percent of output in 
Japan. In India the Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) sector accounts for about 39 per-
cent of manufacturing output and employs an estimated 31 million people in 12.8 million 
enterprises. While small firms in India have achieved higher growth rates in recent years, 
relative to larger firms they also have a labor intensity that is almost four times higher than 
large enterprises. 
 Within studies of SMEs in general there is some evidence that they are more inno-
vative than their larger counterparts. According to the US Small Business Administration 
(US-SBA), firms of less than 500 employees in the United States represent 99.7 percent 
of all employer firms and employ just over half of all private-sector employees. Although 
the US-SBA has adopted a more inclusive definition of an SME (less than 500 employees) 
than many other countries, this set of firms does stand out for their innovativeness. They 
have created 64 percent of net new jobs in the United States in the past 15 years and hire 
40 percent of high-tech workers such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers. 
Moreover, they produce 13 times more patents per employee than large patenting firms and 
these patents are twice as likely as large firm patents to be among the 1 percent most cited.       14

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
  The international activities of SMEs 
 How international are small ﬁ rms? The data show that, in general, a relatively small number 
of SMEs sell products and services outside their domestic market, compared to the total 
number of active SMEs. When we consider another key measure of internationalization, 
foreign direct investment (FDI), again SMEs are less prominent than large multinational 
ﬁ rms as sources of FDI. This makes sense when we think that the majority of small ﬁ rms in 
most countries are likely to be family-owned shops or hairdressers, restaurants, and local 
tradesmen such as plumbers, painters, or carpenters. 
 In the European Union just a quarter of all SMEs export or have exported at some 
point during the past three years. Moreover, their international activities are mostly geared 
toward other countries inside the internal European market and only about 13 percent 
of EU SMEs are active in markets outside the EU. However, SMEs are responsible for a 
larger proportion of total exports from some countries than we might expect. In India, 
SMEs account for an estimated 40 percent of total exports. In the United States just over 
97 percent of all identified exporters are SMEs and these firms produce 30 percent of the 
known export value. 
  Table   11.2    shows how international SMEs can be engaged in trade and/or FDI to access 
inputs or to sell outputs from abroad. If they stick to trading via imports (for inputs such as 
resources, materials, or expertise) and exports (for their outputs, i.e., products or services) 
then they are relying solely on international market transactions to underpin their rela-
tive position in the industry value chain. As discussed elsewhere in this book, by engaging 
in FDI a firm “internalizes” a particular input or output activity based outside its home 
region. In this way it becomes a multinational firm. 15  So, for example, a small retailer 
might import products from abroad to sell locally, or export products to sell internationally. 
Only when this firm establishes its own shops abroad, to sell directly to customers, thereby 
internalizing the overseas sales function, do we refer to it as a multinational firm. Similarly, 
if it were to acquire a key supplier based abroad, thereby internalizing the overseas supply 
function (and engaging in vertical integration along the value chain), we would refer to it 
as a multinational firm. 
 Given that firms have the option to import or export and engage in FDI instead of one 
or both of these forms of trading, we can map out four modes of international operation 
(1a and 1b plus 2a and 2b in  Table   11.2   ). The five case examples show how firms can 
develop a portfolio that includes one, several, or all of these modes of operation. 
 The examples are all taken from the UK International Track 100, a ranking of rapidly 
internationalizing firms compiled by the  Sunday Times  newspaper on the basis of CAGR 
(compound annual growth rate). International sales have to exceed £1 million ($1.6 mil-
lion) and be at least 10 percent of total sales ( http://www.fasttrack.co.uk ). The majority 
of firms in this list are small or medium-sized, with less than 300 employees. Thirty one 
percent are small firms, with less than 50 employees. So all of these firms have international-
ized very rapidly, but they are in very different businesses and have adopted very different 
modes of international operation. 
 Intamarque  was established by the twin Shortt brothers in 2006 in Cheltenham. The 
firm assembles, packages, and distributes customized selections of consumer products 
globally. It employs just 10 staff and yet achieved international export sales of $18.5 mil-
lion (just over 50 percent of total sales) in 2010, up from less than $2 million in 2008. This 
average annual growth rate of 207 percent was partly driven by the popularity of many 
British-branded products in Asia and the Middle East. ( http://www.intamarque.com/ ) 
 SMS Electronics  was born from a local management buy-out of Siemens Manufacturing 
Services in Nottingham in 2002. It is a precision design and contract manufacturing

firm with 131 employees which has had a particular boost from the growing market for video-
conferencing technologies. Exports grew by 418 percent per year from 2008, when foreign 
sales accounted for just 3 percent of total sales, to reach $30 million in 2010. In 2011 60 percent 
of the firm’s sales were in mainland Europe. ( http://www.smselectronics.co.uk/ ) 
 Forward Internet Group , started in 2004 as an online marketing agency, now focuses on 
the use of its “Invisible Hand” technology which notifies Internet users of cheaper prices 
elsewhere on other websites and gets commissions for sales that result from this switching 
behavior. Ebay is a client. International sales grew from $4.8 million per year in 2007 to 
$73 million in 2009, when the firm had less than 50 employees. By 2011 it had grown to 
over 150 employees. It used offshore software developers between 2005 and 2007 and has 
an estimated 1.3 million US users. ( http://www.forward.co.uk/ ) 
 The  Wilton Group  has 227 staff providing a range of services, including project manage-
ment and engineering, to customers in the oil-and-gas industry. Its international sales grew 
by 187 percent per year from 2008 to reach $8.5 million (out of total sales of $61 million) 
in 2010, with its technical personnel working on projects with firms like BP across Europe, 
Africa and the Far East. More recently it has opened offices in Brazil to support the growing 
oil drilling business in the country. ( http://www.wilton-group.co.uk/ ) 
 Ultimate Products  is a home-ware designer, sourcer, importer and exporter, and the 
largest “hard goods” importer in the UK. With 231 employees it delivers over 6,000 dif-
ferent products to retailers such as Tesco in the UK, Carrefour in France, and Wal-Mart 
in the United States. The firm’s international sales grew by 73 percent per year from 2008 
to reach $36.5 million in 2010. It relies on traveling sourcing and sales managers but has 
also opened offices in Belgium and a showroom in Hong Kong. ( http://www.ultimate-

How has Facebook engaged in foreign direct investment (FDI) and why does it 
need to? 
 Facebook has only recently “physically” internationalized through FDI in Dublin, Ireland 
(its international HQ), Hamburg, Hong Kong, Hyderabad, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, 
Selangor, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto. These local offices predomi-
nantly deal with local or regional sales and technical support. They have to work closely 
with advertisers, which can mean joint platform and software development as well as 
service agreements and account management. Without a local presence the firm would 
not achieve the same level of advertising sales and would not be able to provide a quick, 
customized local support service for advertisers or users. Staff at these offices are leading 
moves toward some degree of localization of the platform.   
 Born global firms 
 “Business organizations 
that, from inception, 
seek to derive significant 
competitive advantage 
from the use of resources 
and the sale of outputs in 
multiple countries” 
 Alongside the rapid growth of small, young, and international ﬁ rms, driven by the same 
factors that underlie general globalization processes, there has been a growth of academic 
research in the ﬁ eld of international entrepreneurship. McDougall and Oviatt produced 
some of the most inﬂ uential early studies on the topic and deﬁ ned international entre-
preneurship as the “discovery, enactment, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities— 
across national borders—to create future goods and services” by small and young ventures 
called   “born global” firms  . Born global ﬁ rms are also referred to as international new ven-
tures (INVs) in the international entrepreneurship literature. They can be deﬁ ned as “busi-
ness organizations that,  from inception , seek to derive signiﬁ cant competitive advantage 
from the use of resources and the sale of outputs in multiple countries.”       16 
 A number of ongoing debates have developed around the concept and the empirical 
reality of the born global firm. Three key areas of dispute are: (1) the applicable definition 
of global, specifically is a firm born global (or global at all) if it simply exports and imports 
products and services and has no FDI (which is a common definition of an MNE)? (2) Are 
born global firms really global in terms of their cross-border trade and/or FDI, or are they 
regional? (3) How quickly does a small firm need to develop a global presence to be called 
a born global firm? That is, what does “from inception” mean in the above-mentioned 
definition? 
 Some studies define “new” in this context as less than six years old and it was this 
aspect of INVs that was most at odds with established theories of internationalization. 
The accepted wisdom was that the internationalization process, particularly when it 
underpinned the sustained, long-term multinational operations of a firm, was slow and 
step-wise. Firms were seen to accumulate knowledge and experience of unfamiliar and 
risky foreign markets before committing their scarce resources and capabilities to an inter-
nationalization strategy. Studies at Uppsala University by Johanson and Vahlne, among 
others, famously argued that domestic firms decide to become multinational enterprises 
(MNEs) by expanding into foreign-country markets only after developing their home-
country market successfully. Moreover, the process of internationalization conventionally 
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS THEORY AND 
INTERNATIONAL NEW VENTURES 

345
CHAPTER 11 INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND “BORN GLOBAL” FIRMS
began with entry into nearby countries first, only followed by further expansion into more 
remote countries once the firm had developed experience of operating beyond its domes-
tic market. Low-commitment entry modes, including joint-ventures and alliances, rather 
than M&A or wholly owned greenfield investments, were seen as necessary stages in the 
learning process, to reduce risk and uncertainty. 17  As many small firms do rapidly inter-
nationalize, without going through the gradual, step-wise process depicted by the Uppsala 
model, this presents a challenge for international business theory. 
 Another debate has focused on the scope of internationalization by small firms. Based 
on the broad concept of the triad regions (i.e., North America, European Union, and 
Asia–Pacific), Rugman and Verbeke introduced a regional aspect to the Uppsala school’s 
step-wise and incremental internationalization process of multinational enterprises. They 
put forward evidence of a clear limit to the geographic market coverage where multi-
national enterprises can extract over a majority of their sales revenue from foreign busi-
ness operations. Utilizing the sales segment data across the triad by  Fortune Global 500 
multinational enterprises, they showed that 320 out of the 380 companies have achieved 
over 80 percent of their sales revenue from their home region of the triad on average. 
They argued that the world’s largest multinational enterprises do not operate globally 
and evenly across the triad, but tend to be clustered in the nearby countries of their home 
region of the triad. 18  
 This same argument therefore applies to international new ventures. In fact, because 
they are subject to the multiple liabilities of smallness, newness, and foreignness, they are 
expected to show stronger home-region orientation than large-sized and already-established 
multinational enterprises. Given their limited resources, small firms can be expected to 
reduce risk by selecting nearby countries in their home region as the final destination of 
their internationalization strategy from inception. As a result, international new ventures 
are likely to be born regionally, not globally, within their home region of the triad when 
going abroad into foreign markets. 
 Other theoretical perspectives in the management field can be found to support the 
assertion that international new ventures are more likely to be born regional, not global. 
The resource-based view (RBV) of firms proposes that, since international new ventures 
face a liability of foreignness by operating in unfamiliar and risky foreign markets, they 
should possess unique and distinctive resources and capabilities in order to overcome 
and counteract the liability effectively. 19  The hard-to-replicate resources and capabilities 
internalized within firm boundaries are referred to as firm-specific advantages (FSAs), and 
they can be best exploited in similar institutional contexts within intra-regions than across 
inter-regions, because they are usually location-bound. 
 Transaction cost economics (TCE) also argues that international new ventures face a 
substantial level of transaction costs in both information search and monitoring processes 
when launching international operations across different foreign countries. We would 
normally expect transactions costs to be lower within the INV’s home region of the triad 
due to spatial proximity, cultural and institutional similarities, psychical closeness, and, as 
a result, ease of transportation and communication. According to the organizational learn-
ing perspective, small and young ventures may be able to acquire hard-to-codify and tacit 
information about local customers’ preferences and/or local business practices more easily 
within nearby countries in their home region than across different regions, because learn-
ing commonly takes place efficiently and effectively under culturally related and proximate 
external environments. As a result, we would expect  born regional   INVs to adapt their 
products and services more easily to meet the specific needs of local customers in the same 
home region. 20 
 Despite a substantial increase in research on international new ventures as born global 
firms, most empirical studies in the international entrepreneurship literature are based on

case studies and/or convenience surveys with a small-sized sample of firms. A recent study 
with a large-sized sample of 2,236 firms contains empirical evidence that Korean INVs 
achieve over 90 percent of their export sales from Asia–Pacific, the home region of Korean 
firms. The same study also shows that born regional INVs perform better than others as 
they become more internationalized. 21 
 Although additional empirical research is yet to be needed to achieve a solid conclusion 
on this issue, both current theoretical foundations and recent empirical evidence for small 
and young ventures’ internationalization process in the international business literature 
raise the following critical discussion point: international new ventures are actually born 
regional, not global, with a major focus on their home region of the triad. In other words, 
when small and young ventures decide to go abroad in foreign markets beyond their 
 Spreadshirt: open innovation 
 In March 2001 a student in Leipzig (Germany) called Lukasz 
Gadowski developed an online company for designing and 
selling t-shirts. He was joined by Matthias Spiess, who 
financed the initial phase of the start-up and by January 
2002, 100 online affiliate ventures or “partner shops” had 
joined from around the world. Despite the enterprise being 
judged an “unrealistic business model” at the Cologne 
Business Plan Competition, 500,000 shops had joined by 
mid-2008 and the “Spreadshirt” company had made history. 
 The company’s goal is to be “THE creative apparel plat-
form, inspiring people to create, buy or sell individualized 
fashion.” It has an unusual business model, with customers 
playing the roles of buyers, sellers, and designers. They can 
buy customized t-shirts, hoodies, jackets, bags, or acces-
sories directly from the online store. Whether they are 
individuals or corporate customers they can also sell via 
the Spreadshirt online platform by setting up a shop. Firms 
like CNN, Holiday Inn, Nissan, and the Sun newspaper in the 
UK have done this to sell their own branded designs. But 
individual entrepreneurs anywhere in the world can also 
offer customized clothing through their own Spreadshirt 
shop website, while Spreadshirt takes care of inventory 
management, manufacturing, logistics, payments, and 
other aspects of customer service for their partner shops. 
This allows designers to sell their own designs without 
the investment required to establish their own full-service 
companies. However, providing the capability for individuals 
to design one-off shirts without the need to set up a shop 
now makes up 40 percent of Spreadshirt’s business. 
 Spreadshirt also runs “laFraise,” Europe’s largest t-shirt 
design competition whereby each week designers from all 
over the world put forward their latest creations and the 
Spreadshirt community votes for the best. Winners get prizes 
as well as having their designs printed and sold globally. This 
is “crowd sourcing,” effectively outsourcing the complex 
decision regarding which, out of hundreds of design options, 
a company should print and try to sell. By manufacturing a 
limited set of designs a producer benefits from significant 
economies of scale and higher profits, but this requires a 
process for selecting the most popular designs. Rather than 
trying to asses this through market research, Spreadshirt 
and its “designer-seller-customers” use crowd sourcing. 
 Spreadshirt’s primary activities take place via a range 
of online networks. It is both global and local in a way 
that firms with business models based on fixed assets 
can never be. As partner shops join and leave, the firm’s 
international portfolio of “resources” and its online profile 
in country markets change. But it does also have a physical 
presence of branch offices in France, Britain, the United 
States, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and the Netherlands, 
to support its head office in Germany. 
 Despite being the European market leader in its field, 
Spreadshirt has a limited number of employees (300) and 
outsources the “physical” aspects of its business on behalf 
of customers. Manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain 
management and even elements of its marketing are done via 
contracts with other firms. The firm has half-a-million part-
ner shops and millions of customers worldwide. Revenues 
grew from €12.2 million in 2006 up to 15.3 million (25.7 per-
cent) in 2007 and an estimated €21 million in 2009, although 
accurate figures are not available after 2007 (Krisch, 2009).

 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 

347
CHAPTER 11 INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND “BORN GLOBAL” FIRMS
 Dynamic capability is “the ﬁ rm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconﬁ gure internal and 
external competences to address rapidly changing environments.” The dynamic capa-
bilities approach has also been seen as a useful conceptual and analytical framework for 
understanding small, adaptable ﬁ rms. Because of their relative lack of ﬁ nancial and human 
resources and the often-cited need to respond quickly to temporary opportunities, such as 
new-technology waves or consumer fads, dynamic capabilities and organizational agility 
are seen to be more important to the survival and success of such ﬁ rms. 23 
 While it may not be particularly representative of small firms in general, the popular 
stereotype of a successful, fast-growing, high-tech start-up does seem to match what we 
might expect from a firm with the most dynamic of capabilities. They are the focus of 
attention partly because they are seen as the ideal-type of wealth-creating organization (see 
the Active Learning Case on Facebook at the start of this chapter), but also because they 
are seen to hold lessons for other kinds of firms, large and small, looking to improve their 
responsiveness and innovativeness. 
 Research suggests that dynamic capabilities relate to the processes by which, and the 
success with which, small firms learn to grow and adapt to changing threats and oppor-
tunities in their surrounding competitive environment. This includes a heightened ability 
to sense external changes that present new threats or opportunities and the strategic and 
organizational flexibility to adapt to these. Dynamic capability theories refer to “search and 
selection” capabilities alongside “configuration and deployment” capabilities. Together 
these enable firms to orchestrate co-specialized assets, including outside knowledge and 
expertise, in a continuous way to maintain alignment with this changing environment. 
This way they are quicker at creating, extending, and modifying resources and assets to 
maintain competitive advantages, relative to firms with less dynamic capabilities.       24 
 There are obvious parallels with Darwinian evolutionary theory and indeed dynamic 
capabilities approaches draw extensively from concepts such as “requisite variety,” “selection 
and retention,” and “evolutionary fitness” and from the work of evolutionary economists, 
such as Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter coined the term “creative destruction” to refer to 
the process by which superior new ways of doing things continually usurp old ways in an 
inevitable cycle of renewal. Schumpeter identified innovation as the critical dimension of 
economic change, contrary to the popular theories of the day, and placed the entrepreneur 
at the centre of his view of economic systems. 25  
  Life cycles, networks, and clusters 
 Studies of dynamic capabilities in ﬁ rms of all sizes refer to the concept of capability life 
cycles. These depict how ﬁ rms need to periodically renew their capabilities as they expand 
and evolve, either through internal upgrading and/or via acquisitions, joint-ventures, and 
other kinds of external alliances. Failure to renew increases the dangers of other, newer, or 
faster ﬁ rms developing capabilities that underpin superior competitive advantages. 26 
 Life-cycle models are commonly used to depict the growth profiles of SMEs.       27 Whether 
“born global” or as a local start-up, small firms follow a rocky road to maturity. Lack of 
investment capital is a key limitation, preventing many small firms from moving between 
stages of growth, for example by diversifying their product portfolio, expanding into new

markets, adding production capacity to achieve economies of scale, or investing in R&D.  
 Lack of specialist expertise, particularly for high-tech start-ups, is also a major limitation. 
Because of these and other constraints on survival and growth, the ability of the individual 
entrepreneur to utilize personal networks to access sources of finance, materials, others’ 
expertise, and knowledge about market opportunities is of paramount importance. 
Creating, developing, and leveraging networks to steer the small firm through these obstacles 
to growth is the core dynamic capability of the entrepreneur. 
 For some time researchers and policymakers have emphasized the importance of local 
networks or   clusters   as the lifeblood of new business growth. Popularized by studies by 
Annalee Saxenian and others on Silicon Valley in California, the roots of these analyses 
lie further back in research on “agglomeration economies” by economic geographers. A 
unifying theme is the need for a critical mass of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and 
particular kinds of specialists plus a risk-embracing culture of trial-and-error. The ingredi-
ents create a dynamic mix underpinning a self-reinforcing local growth cycle. A thousand 
flowers bloom and some survive. 28 
 High-tech and low-tech clusters, or geographic concentrations of related businesses, 
exist all over the world, from Boston, Route 128 (biotech), Austin, Texas (computing), 
and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina (life sciences) in the United States; Cambridge 
(biotech) and the M4 corridor (ICT) in the UK; Aachen (lasers, ceramics, IT) in Germany; 
Prado (textiles and fashion) in North Italy; Rajcot (diesel engines) and Ludhiana (woollen 
knitwear and knitting machines) in India; São Paulo (ethanol and biofuel technology) in 
Brazil. In China, huge but specialized production clusters have developed more recently, 
predominantly in the east, including for example: Zhili in Zhejiang province (children’s 
clothes), Datang (socks–6 billion pairs each year!), and Dali in the Nanhai district 
(aluminum products). 
 Industry clusters research show that, up to a point and for certain kinds of busi-
nesses, small firms are the product of their immediate environment. They rely on local 
resources, capabilities, and connections and the success of the entrepreneur depends 
on his or her ability to orchestrate these via local networks in a dynamic way, respond-
ing to the shifting threats and opportunities in that same environment. Face-to-face 
interaction for building trust, as well as for communicating, coordinating, and negotiat-
ing, remains important, despite the rise of e-business. This, alongside the efficiency of 
co-locating specialist industry suppliers and contractors, underpins the importance of 
geographic proximity. 
 However, most clusters have relied on access to international markets for some time, 
often through exports, sometimes through FDI. Silicon Valley evolved by selling infor-
mation and communication products to the rest of the world and the people of Datang, 
China do not buy the 6 billion pairs of socks they make each year! The input-side is largely 
locally bound, while the output-side is global. 
 But many of these co-location drivers apply to businesses built around physical pro-
duction, distribution, and sales networks. A growing volume of economic activity is 
based on buying and selling knowledge and expertise, from media content and software 
products to financial, legal, and consultancy services. While trust and relationship-
building are still critical ingredients, new generations of entrepreneurs develop these 
online, thereby exploiting the advantages of being able to leverage the cheapest and the 
best inputs from multiple locations around the world to serve global markets. We have 
many examples, including case studies on Facebook and Spreadshirt in this chapter, of 
how small start-ups can quickly extend their reach globally by connecting and continu-
ally reconnecting local capability endowments via dynamic international networks. This 
flexible, connective capability is perhaps  the  critical dynamic capability for large and 
small multinational firms.

Explain how Facebook sources inputs globally. What advantages does this 
provide? 
 Facebook benefits from the inputs of a wide range of entrepreneurs and developers from 
over 190 countries around the world who add features and customize the platform and 
content for different groups of users. Third-party developers particularly use Facebook’s 
translation software to create local versions of content in their own countries. They can 
launch products and services associated with the Facebook platform and Facebook ben-
efits by the resulting snowball effect of new products and services extending the use of 
their network and bringing more users to their websites. But this form of “open inno-
vation” also enables Facebook to benefit from the ideas, drive, creativity, and initiative of 
a large global network of programmers and content developers, rather than relying on 
in-house R&D investment to develop their business. External developers also provide a 
better interactive connection to local user needs than the firm is able to maintain on its 
own, even by investing in its offices abroad.   
 Elsewhere in this book we discuss the competitive strengths of large multinational ﬁ rms, 
some of which stem from what Alfred Chandler, an emeritus professor at Harvard Business 
School, described as scale and scope advantages. Scale provides ﬁ nancial power and various 
economies of scale across the functions of the ﬁ rm. This is combined with scope, which 
refers to the breadth and diversity of assets and capabilities which provide large ﬁ rms with 
a portfolio of geographic and innovation-related options, enhancing their ability to attain 
superior proﬁ ts.  29 
 SMEs face significant limitations compared to large firms, across both these dimensions, 
making internationalization strategies riskier. They do not have the financial muscle to 
“buy” their way into new markets, or spend on customizing products and brands for local 
customers. They also lack the range of specialists to draw on to shape and implement mar-
ket-entry strategies, such as legal experts or managers with experience of local cultures. As 
described below, these limitations mean that small firms often need to be that much more 
entrepreneurial and innovative and/or take risky short-cuts, to expand across national 
borders. It also means that some elements of established theories of internationalization 
fail to adequately explain the patterns and processes of small firm internationalization.       30 
  How do SME managers know which markets to enter? 
 Mathews and Zander propose three milestones of international entrepreneurial processes: 
(1) the discovery of new opportunities; (2) the deployment of resources in the exploitation 
of these opportunities; and (3) engagement with competitors.       31 
 The first major challenge for any firm looking to expand internationally is to decide 
which market location offers the best cost–benefit opportunity. Larger firms can invest 
in the due-diligence process underlying this decision. Managers can employ in-house 
resources and expertise and/or external specialists to help identify the most promising

INTERNATIONALIZING SMEs

PART THREE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGIES
country markets in which to expand. As described in  Chapter 15 , this can entail a complex 
analysis comparing the relative risks and rewards of different country markets. 
 Decision-makers in both small and large firms also rely on their personal experience 
and existing international network relationships, both informal and formal, to assess the 
potential of different markets. This includes knowledge gained from existing buyers and 
suppliers and alliance partners, even when these are import and export contractors.       32 But 
there is evidence that shows that these personal experiences and relationships are much 
more important to the decision-making process in small firms. Studies show how small 
firms, and particularly the smallest, owner-managed enterprises, tend to decide which 
markets to enter on the basis of fairly subjective evidence. This includes the views and 
opinions of personal contacts abroad and the experience and personal characteristics of 
small firm owners themselves.       33  A senior manager might spot a market opportunity during 
a family holiday abroad and this chance experience can be a strong influence on a small 
firm’s market expansion strategy. 
 A study by Collinson and Holden used   mental maps   to capture the perceptions of 
decision-makers in a sample of British SMEs of the relative risks and rewards of foreign 
markets. Mental maps are defined as “cognitive representations of the nature and attributes 
of the spatial environment.” They represent images of spatial environments developed by 
individuals based on their collated influences and experiences and information available 
to them.  Figure   11.4    shows the mental map for all of the firms in the study, with darker 
shading denoting more attractive foreign markets. 34

 The map shows that mainland Europe and the United States represent the most attrac-
tive markets, given their size and familiarity to these British respondents. Much of Africa 
and parts of the Middle East, Southeast Asia and central Europe are either less well known 
or seen to be high-risk areas. Collinson and Holden concluded that the mental maps of 
decision-makers do reflect their individual and group perceptions of opportunity and risk 
and subsequent geographical bias. They vividly illustrate how “psychic distance”—the 
perceived degree of cultural, social and psychological differences between a home country 
and a foreign country—operates in practice. These perceptions do form the basis of inter-
nationalization decisions. 
 The study also compared the views of managers in small firms that had international-
ized, and therefore had experience of international location selection and market-entry, 
with non-internationalized firms.  Figure  11.5 compares their responses. 
 It shows how factors such as language, future potential growth, currency stability, and 
foreign investment restrictions are rated higher as influences on the country selection de -
cision for firms that have experience of internationalization. Managers in non-international 
firms are more concerned about the international financial standing of the target market, 
general ease of access, and climate. The relative ratings of language and climate show a 
complete contrast. Managers who have direct experience of working across language bar-
riers know how this creates far more additional complexity, uncertainty, and risk than 
differences in the weather! 
  Modes of entry and adaptation for success in foreign markets 
 There is a general consensus across the entrepreneurship literature that more innovative 
small ﬁ rms engage in exporting because they are producing superior products relative to

local competitors. Similarly, small ﬁ rms that expand internationally through FDI are likely 
to be more innovative than their counterparts because they have successfully adapted not 
just products and services but their management practices to other cultural and insti-
tutional contexts. In this way, innovation and internationalization are complementary 
activities. 35  
 In terms of modes of market-entry, studies suggest that firms tend to opt for higher 
commitment and higher-risk entry modes (such as M&A or greenfield investments) with 
increasing firm size. SMEs are often assumed to opt for low equity and cooperative strategies 
because they have less access to financial assets or the level of human resources needed 
to support these higher-commitment modes of entry. This also means that they have to 
quickly reach a level of profitability when they enter new markets because of their limited 
ability to raise investment capital. 36 
 Clearly the specific challenges vary depending on the nature of the target country mar-
ket and the individual firm. One in-depth study of British SMEs in Japan confirmed the 
general conclusion above, showing that small firms tended to enter into joint-ventures 
and collaborative alliances with Japanese enterprises in order to gain local knowledge and 
credibility with  keiretsu  networks and to share the investment risks. The study also showed 
how market barriers faced by all firms proved to be more challenging for small firms. These 
included: 
 ■   The high costs of start-up and operation, including costs of living and working in Japan, 
the high tax burden, labor and property costs. 
 ■   Local recruitment difficulties, partly stemming from traditional lifetime employment 
and lack of status for Japanese working in small foreign enterprises.  
 ■   Complex employment legislation and very different HRM practices, including the 
culturally embedded obligations of employers in Japan adding to the more generic 
barriers of language and culture.  
 ■   Market restrictions, including barriers associated with trading associations, “ dango ” 
and  keiretsu  structures, sometimes supported by government standards and trading 
legislation. The “tied” system of distribution in Japan, bound by strong face-to-face 
ties as well as cross-shareholding or financing arrangements between sellers and buyers 
at each level, proved to be a particular problem. These add to the costs and difficul-
ties of getting products introduced into the market and distributed across different 
regional markets.  
 ■   Government-related complications such as local and national standards, accounting 
and taxation regulations are not “user-friendly” for non-Japanese and governance pro-
cesses can be ambiguous.  
 ■   Demanding customers and intense rivalry, which have been the drivers of Japanese 
innovative capabilities in the past, place huge pressures on foreign entrants to adapt 
marketing, product and service quality and features, and after-sales support to meet the 
expectations of consumers and corporate customers. 37 
 Small survivors are the SME success stories in large, complex markets like Japan. Their 
success is evidence of their dynamic capability to adapt and their ability to continually 
innovate. Lessons for other firms are relevant because these SMEs have proven their ability 
to adapt products and services as well as their own processes and management practices to 
the economic, institutional, and cultural contexts of foreign markets. Moreover, they have 
not only adapted to fit into these competitive environments but to succeed against local 
competitors. Their “fitness” is of a Darwinian kind. 

353
CHAPTER 11 INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND “BORN GLOBAL” FIRMS
 1   The ability to continually recombine resources, assets, and capabilities from different 
locations to meet the changing needs of customers in different markets around the 
world gives multinational firms, large and small, firm-specific innovation advantages. 
However, their lack of scale and scope advantages means that small firms face greater 
risks when expanding abroad. They need to develop more entrepreneurial and dynamic 
capabilities to succeed. 
 2   Firms centralize or de-centralize various innovation activities (sensing, responding to, 
and implementing) globally depending on the trade-offs between standardization and 
economies of scale and the need for national responsiveness. The center-for-global, 
local-for-local, local-for-global, and global-for-global typology and the concept of 
 differentiated networks for innovation capture this key trade-off.  
 3   Definitions of SMEs vary around the world; in Europe these are firms with less than 
250 employees, in the United States it includes firms below 500 employees. A small 
proportion engage in international trade and relatively few engage in FDI. International 
SMEs manage various combinations of market mechanisms (imports and exports) and 
internalization (input and output-oriented FDI) to benefit from location endowments 
worldwide.  
 4   Born global firms depend from “birth” on a global presence for their survival. A key debate 
is whether firms count as born global if they simply trade, rather than engage in FDI. There 
is also strong evidence to suggest that most are born regional, not global, particularly 
because they are subject to the multiple liabilities of smallness, newness, and foreignness.  
 5   Dynamic capability is: “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal 
and external competences to address rapidly changing environments.” The dynamic 
capabilities approach is useful for understanding international new ventures because 
their survival through the entrepreneurial life cycle depends on the continuous renewal 
of assets, knowledge, and global networks.  
 6   Industry clusters evolve from the efficiencies of co-locating specialist industry suppliers 
and contractors. But part of their evolution is also due to the continuing value of face-
to-face interaction for building trust, co-specialization networks, and entrepreneurial 
cultures. As knowledge-based products and services grow in economic importance rela-
tive to physical products, virtual network hubs or nodes will grow in importance relative 
to location-bound clusters.  
 7   Because SMEs lack the resources to invest in rigorous market analysis, personal experi-
ence plays a greater role in market-entry decision making. Mental maps show how risk-
perception influences market selection and internationalization strategies.  
 8   SMEs need to be more entrepreneurial, innovative, and adaptable to successfully break 
into foreign markets, given they lack the resources, scale, and scope advantages of 
larger firms. Tough and expensive country markets like Japan present greater risks and 
demand even greater levels of innovation and adaptability.

What disadvantages to SMEs have relative to large multinational enterprises for 
innovation?   
 2  As a form of country-specific advantage (CSA), how might a strong national 
system of innovation (NSI) support the development of innovation-related firm-
specific advantages (FSAs) for an internationalizing firm?   
 3  List some examples of innovation FSAs for market-seeking internationalization 
and for resource-seeking internationalization.   
 4  Give an example of “local-for-global” innovation (from one of the case studies in

 5  Why do national governments need specific criteria for defining an SME? Why 
might different governments use different definitions?   
 6  Explain, with an example, why an international new venture or SME might

international business.   
 7  What are the key debates around the definition of the born global firm and why do 
these make a difference in terms of our measurement and understanding of them?

making in small firms? 
 GE Healthcare in India: locally driven innovation 
 GE’s Mac 400 is an ultra-portable electrocardiogram (ECG) 
which is made in India and has sold well locally, partly 
because it costs one-third of the price of an equivalent 
imported product. It is also light-weight, battery-operated, 
and easily serviced, making it ideal for India’s rural areas 
where patients are far from specialist hospitals and power 
outages are common. The reason that the Mac 400 is 
so well suited to India is because it was conceptualized, 
designed, and sourced, as well as manufactured, in India, 
all following local customer requirements. 
 GE employs over 13,000 people in India and exports over 
$1 billion in products and services. One of its major busi-
ness divisions, GE Healthcare, has invested in local joint 
ventures and manufacturing plants since the beginning of

the 1990s, to reduce costs and increase local sales. But it 
is only much more recently that it has devolved some of 
the responsibility, capability, and resources to the local 
subsidiaries to pursue locally appropriate innovation. 
 The John F Welch Technology Center (JFWTC) in 
Bangalore was established in 2000 and is GE’s first 
and largest multidisciplinary Research and Product 
Development Center outside of the United States. It col-
laborates with GE’s four other R&D facilities that form the 
GE Global Research team (in New York, Munich, Shanghai, 
and Rio de Janeiro) to conduct R&D for all of GE’s busi-
nesses worldwide. With over 4,000 employees and over 
1,000 patents to its credit, it has hosted a range of technol-
ogy development projects from train engines and aviation 
turbo fans to baby warmers in the healthcare field. 
 These investments, together with the organizational and 
cultural changes underpinning the devolution of power and 
resources to the local management in India, are beginning 
to pay dividends. Although India accounts for less than 2 per-
cent of GE Healthcare’s US$17 billion in revenue, this is set 
to rise dramatically as India’s economic growth translates 
into increased buying power and better healthcare provision. 
At the same time GE’s India-based R&D efforts are creat-
ing products that are being sold globally. Two thousand of 
the 7,500 Mac 400’s that GE Healthcare has sold have been 
bought by Indian customers; the rest have been bought by 
customers in other country markets. 
 The drivers that underpin the focus of healthcare prod-
uct innovation in India, including accessibility, quality, and 
low cost, apply to other developing and emerging markets. 
So new products designed and developed in India are 
likely to sell well in these markets. This has been termed 
“low-cost” (or “frugal”) innovation and “innovation for the 
bottom-of-the-pyramid” (Prahalad, 2006). By allowing local 
management to drive innovation, GE is able to target this 
rapidly growing market segment globally. 
 Success in one market segment can, however, create 
challenges elsewhere. The fact is that products like the 
Mac 400 have the potential to significantly undercut more 
expensive (and profitable) products sold in more advanced 
markets like Europe and the United States. This leaves GE 
with a potential problem of its own making: new products 
from its emerging economy subsidiaries may increas-
ingly ‘cannibalize’ the firm’s existing products in its more 
advanced markets.

 REAL CASE 
 SetJam: the mini multinational 
 SetJam was founded in June 2009 and, like the vast major-
ity of high-tech start-ups (but unlike the success stories we 
tend to hear about), it remains small and highly innovative 
but not exceptionally profitable. 
 SetJam works like a Google search engine for online 
video content, such as movies and TV shows. It allows 
users to search the web and create a directory of TV pro-
grams, both free and paid content, to view at any time. Its 
founder, Ryan Janssen, promotes the venture by describ-
ing how an organization of fewer than 15 people managed 
to build a “better search engine than Google for less than 
$50,000.” Like Google, however, the firm hopes to make 
money by taking customers where they want to go online 
faster and more efficiently than anyone else. On the back 
of the rise of broadband-enabled TV the central idea is to 
make online TV quick and simple for customers, filtering 
out the massive volume of user-generated content on the 
net and providing just regular programs for viewers to 
watch whenever they have time. 
 SetJam is headquartered in New York City’s “Silicon 
Alley,” an area associated with high-tech start-ups includ-
ing Foursquare, Hot Potato, Six Apart, Flickr, Trust Art, and

Vimeo, and named to echo the larger and better-known 
Silicon Valley in California. But in contrast to its Californian 
counterpart, this New York high-tech cluster has evolved 
around the media, publishing, luxury goods, and fashion 
industries. Start-up firms develop software for consumer-
oriented services and social media websites, rather than 
for enterprises or electronics products. Many of the largest 
firms in these industries are headquartered in New York, 
so start-ups in the Silicon Alley cluster thrive on connec-
tions with client firms and the availability of experienced 
media and fashion industry employees to co-develop their 
platforms. 
 SetJam’s client and investor connections are developed 
and maintained by CEO Ryan Janssen together with a 
project manager and the rest of a small team in the firm’s 
New York office. The rest of SetJam’s employees, consist-
ing of six full-time developers and three quality assurance 
specialists, are all based 4,300 miles away in Warsaw, 
Poland. The six-hour time difference, the language bar-
rier, and the complexities of dealing with a different set of 
employment regulations all beg the question: Why split the 
company in this way? The answer lies in human capital; the 
cost and availability of experienced software programmers 
and developers in Warsaw, relative to New York. 
 Human capital, rather than fixed assets, and not just the 
cost but the availability of highly educated people, with par-
ticular kinds of expertise, is a key driver for location decisions 
even in the smallest of firms. Poland has the youngest 
population in Europe and 45 percent of 20–24-year-olds 
are in higher education, compared to 34 percent in the 
United States. Eighty percent of students speak English 
(33 percent speak two foreign languages) and the country 
also has an excellent ICT (information and communication 
technologies) education and training infrastructure. These 
location attractions have prompted many of the large 
multinationals to establish R&D centres in Poland, includ-
ing ABB, Fujitsu, GlaxoSmithKline, IBM, Intel, Motorola, 
Oracle, and Siemens. But they also make it an ideal location 
for offshore software engineering, an industry in which 
global spending is expected to grow tenfold over the next 
10 years to an estimated $150 billion. With labor costs that 
are not far off those of India, Poland is set to benefit from 
this growth. 
 For SetJam, new technology is not just the focus of its 
business model; it underpins the way the company copes 
with its divided structure, enabling innovative ways of 
remote recruitment and team-working. Janssen found the 
first programmers through a process involving emails, 
Skype talks and an evaluation of their “online presence,” 
including blogs and open source contributions. He also 
viewed their profiles and work experience on specialist 
collaborative software development hosting sites, such as 
Github and Django People. The latter is a global network 
of over 7,600 software developers from over 140 countries 
working on a variety of contract projects and represents a 
worldwide pool of “pay-as-you-go” expertise. 
 Digital bridges connect the two parts of the firm. 
“Campfire,” a team collaboration platform with a real-
time chat facility, and “Lighthouse,” a project planning 
and workflow tracking system, are used to communicate 
and coordinate development projects. Skype video is also 
permanently on, providing a constant window between New 
York and Warsaw and creating a social interface as well as 
a business portal. Janssen is happy with the level of unity 
created across this small but ambitious organization by 
these online connections, despite quips by the Warsaw-
based team that they, at development HQ, have outsourced 
the CEO role to the United States.

   15  This distinction lies at the heart of Oliver Williamson’s 
“transaction cost economics” (TCE) (Williamson, 1975) 
between market and hierarchy. The latter refers to the 
situation where transactions are internalized within the 
firm (“hierarchy”) because this incurs lower transactions 
costs compared to the market. In a similar vein, but with 
a different approach, Edith Penrose (1959) asked “why do 
firms do what they do?” I.e. what determines the boundaries 
of the firm? She explored why firms left some business 
activities to the market and encompassed others internally. 
This is of central interest in international business theory, 
but only when the internalization involves incorporating 
overseas assets or business activities into the firm, rather 
than relying on (import-export) markets. By taking this step 
firms become multinationals.

on S-curves. S-curves show how firms can become over-
dependent on and “locked” into an over-reliance on certain 
kinds of products, assets, and capabilities, such that when 
markets or technologies change they are unable to reinvent 
themselves and go into decline. See, amongst other work:

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Production strategy is critical to effective international operations. 
Most goods and services have very limited lives, so MNEs must 
continually provide new offerings, which can be accomplished 
only through a well-formulated production strategy. This chapter 
examines how MNEs carry out this process. In doing so, we will 
focus on the entire range of production strategies from research and 
development to manufacturing, shipment, and the final international 
destination. We will look at the most current approaches, including 
speed-to-market, concurrent engineering, and continuous cost 
reduction. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  the role of research, development, and innovation in 
production strategy.  
 2  Relate  some of the most critical steps in generating goods and 
services, including global sourcing, costing techniques, quality 
maintenance, effective materials handling, inventory control, and 
the proper emphasis on service.  
 3  Describe  the nature and importance of international logistics in 
production strategy.  
 4  Review  some of the major production strategies being used by 
MNEs, including strategic alliances and acquisitions.

 PRODUCTION STRATEGY 
 Chapter 12

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 General Electric is a multibillion-dollar multinational cor-
poration whose products range from 65 cent light bulbs 
to billion-dollar power plants. Based on revenues, assets, 
profits, and market value, the company was listed by 
 Fortune  magazine as number 13 in the world in 2010. One 
reason for GE’s annual revenue of $156,779 million is its 
ability to manage a diverse multi product-line operation, 
handling such products as major appliances, lighting, 
medical diagnostic imaging equipment, motors, and com-
mercial and military aircraft engines and engineering 
materials. GE also provides a range of services, including 
those related to electricity provision, media (GE owns NBC 
in the United States), and multimedia programming and 
distribution. Much of the company’s success can be attrib-
uted to the production-related concepts it has employed 
over the last two decades. During the 1980s, work-out, 
process mapping, and best practices were GE’s applied 
concepts. 
 Work-out  is a training program designed to empower 
employees to implement their problem-solving ideas. A 
group of 40 to 100 people, picked by management from all 
ranks and functional areas, attend a three-day meeting. 
The first day consists of a manager leading the group in 
roughing out an agenda addressing areas in which prod-
uctivity can be increased. Then the manager leaves and for 
the next  l\  days the group breaks into teams to tackle the 
agenda. On the last afternoon the manager returns and 
one by one the team members make their proposals for 
improved productivity. The manager can make only three 
responses: agree, disagree, or ask for more information; 
in the last case, an individual manager must empower a 
team to get the information by an agreed-upon date. These 
work-out sessions have proved extremely successful. In 
one case, a group of workers convinced management to 
allow their factory to bid against an outside vendor for the 
right to build new protective shields for grinding machines. 
As a result, the GE group completed the job for $16,000 
versus $96,000 for the vendor. 
 The second method,  process mapping,  is to create a flow-
chart that shows all the steps, no matter how small, involved 
in making or doing something. The map is analyzed for ways 
to eliminate steps and save time and money. One work 
group was able to reorganize production, cut manufacturing 
time in half, and reduce inventory by $4 million. 
 The third method,  best practices,  consists of finding com-
panies that do things better than GE does and emulating 
them. GE personnel try to answer the question: what is the 
secret of this other company’s success? Quite often the 
answer includes such things as getting products to market 
faster than anyone else, treating suppliers like partners, 
or having superior inventory management. As a result of 
best practices, GE is now keeping executives in their jobs 
for longer periods of time rather than rotating them quickly 
through new jobs; the best practices process revealed that 
frequent changes create problems in new product intro-
ductions. The company also learned how to use continuous 
improvement processes more effectively to bring a new 
product into the market ahead of the competition and then 
work on introducing new technologies. In the past the firm 
would try to perfect all technologies first and then intro-
duce the final product version. 
 In the 1990s, the dominant production concept was Six 
Sigma, a name that originates from a statistical method 
for deriving near-perfect quality, equal to 3.4 defects per 
million operations. The Six Sigma process allows GE to 
measure how many “defects” there are in a given process 
and then systematically work to eliminate them to approxi-
mate “zero defects.” Six Sigma recognizes three ele-
ments: the customer, the process, and the employee. The 
customer is the key to defining quality. GE uses the term 
“Delighting Customers” to generate a mentality whereby 
customer expectations of performance, reliability, com-
petitive price, on-time delivery, service, clear and cor-
rect transaction processing, and other customer needs 
become a key factor in all processes. The second element, 
the process, promotes “Outside-In Thinking Quality.” GE 
must understand the transaction life cycle from the cus-
tomer’s point of view and identify significant value and 
improvement from that same perspective. Under the ban-
ner “Leadership Commitment People,” the third element 
of Six Sigma, the employee, requires that all personnel 
use their talents and energies to satisfy customers. All 
employees are trained in Six Sigma, including statistical 
tools, strategy, and techniques of Six Sigma quality. At the 
core of the process is a workforce mentality on customer 
quality expectations, defect reduction, process capability, 
variation (the customer reacts to the variance rather than 
the average results), stability of operations, and designing 
processes to meet customer expectations. 
 GE’s advantage over failing conglomerates is its ability 
to transfer knowledge over the whole company. This can 
be attributed to former CEO Jack Welch, who oversaw 
GE’s transformation from a mainly manufacturing firm to 
a service-oriented, knowledge-based company. He defined

GE’s culture by creating a workforce that can identify 
opportunities and implement changes. 
 Despite GE’s firm-specific advantages (FSAs) in produc-
tion, its competitive edge has not been transferred equally 
to other parts of the world, especially not other triad 
nations that have significant domestic competitors. While 
GE used to be a home-region company with 64 percent of 
its sales in the Americas, now the company is more diver-
sified. GE now derives 46.20 percent of its revenues from 
the US alone. Once its revenues from Canadian and Latin 
American operations are added on top of the US sales, the 
number rises to nearly 54.30 percent. Europe, its largest 
foreign regional market, accounts for only 23.50 percent of 
revenues, whereas countries in the Pacific Basin account 
for 13.20 percent. The remaining 7 percent are accounted 
for by other regions (2.6 percent) and non-segmented US 
exports to other countries (6.4 percent). 
 In October 2000, GE, as the world’s largest producer of jet 
engines, and Honeywell, a manufacturer of aircraft electron-
ics, agreed to a $42 billion merger. The two US-based com-
panies secured antitrust authorities’ approval in the United 
States and Canada, but the deal came to a halt because of the 
European Union. This was the first time the EU had blocked 
a merger between two US companies. The European compe-
tition commissioner claimed that such a merger would have 
closed the market to competitors and asked GE to divest 
itself of GE Capital Aviation Services by selling it to one of its 
main rivals. GE offered to sell the company privately, but the 
EU countered that a friendly transaction might not result in 
true divestiture. US politicians, frustrated by the European 
stand, threatened to retaliate if the EU did not approve the 
merger. Republican Senator Phil Gramm went as far as to 
accuse the EU of enacting policies to protect its companies. 
The EU rejected US government intervention in the matter 
and the merger did not materialize.

 In what way could best practices help GE develop more effective international strategies? Explain. 
 Production management has been responsible for many new goods and services. Examples 
are as varied as Palm’s handhelds, Apple’s iPod, Honda’s hybrid cars, HP’s digital cameras, 
eBay’s Internet auctions, and ﬁ ve-star hotel operations at the Ritz-Carlton. The nature of 
production management in the MNE is similar in many respects to that in domestic ﬁ rms. 
Both are concerned with the efﬁ cient use of labor and capital. Both are also interested in 
investing in research and development (R&D) and in organizing operations to generate 
successful new product lines and increase production and service efﬁ ciency. 
 Like domestic firms, MNEs need to organize their production management so they 
can minimize operating costs through the use of logistics and inventory control. Canon, 
for example, relocates production to China only if labor accounts for over 5 percent of 
production costs. 1  Acer, the successful upstart from Taiwan, makes sure that computer parts 
with short product life cycles are shipped by air, and those with long product life cycles 
are shipped by sea (see Active Learning Case in  Chapter 20 ). However, pressures from 
host-country governments or special interest groups can affect a multinational’s decision 
making in these areas. For example, host governments often criticize resource-based MNEs 
for their backward, forward, and horizontal integration.   Backward integration , which is 
the ownership of equity assets used earlier in the production cycle (such as an auto firm 
acquiring a steel company), is criticized for doing little for employment or development

in the host nation.   Forward integration  , which is the purchase of assets or facilities that 
move the company closer to the customer (such as a computer manufacturer that acquires 
a retail chain that specializes in computer sales), is criticized on the basis that MNEs use the 
strategy to homogenize consumer tastes to the detriment of national identities.   Horizontal 
integration  , which is the acquisition of firms in the same line of business (such as a 
computer chip manufacturer that buys a competitor), is attacked for introducing similar 
product lines on a worldwide basis and undercutting the existence of local firms, most of 
which lack the economies of scale that can be achieved by MNEs.       2 
 There are similar challenges in the industrial relations area, where MNEs must take into 
account different labor practices and wage rates. For example, multinationals are often 
under pressure from host governments to use local sourcing for their supplies, hire local 
workers, train home-country managers and supervisors, and help improve the production 
environment in the host nation. These decisions can sometimes result in higher produc-
tion costs, although most international auto firms, for example, use local suppliers and 
workers to offset this problem. 
 The financing of operations is another production-related challenge. The choice between 
local and international borrowing and the use of internally generated funds to minimize the 
cost of capital is complicated by foreign exchange risk, international tax laws, and government 
controls on capital (see  Chapter 16 ). Additionally, MNEs need to know where they are on their 
production cost curves in each country, as well as globally, so as to exploit any cost advantages 
with an appropriate organization structure. For example, as Toyota’s worldwide market share 
began to stabilize, the firm found it needed to become increasingly more efficient. 3  
 The above examples illustrate some of the common production-related problems fac-
ing international firms. However, experienced MNEs have learned how to deal with these 
challenges. In doing so, they employ a wide gamut of production strategies that address 
research, development, innovation, global sourcing, costing techniques, and inventory 
control. 4 The following sections examine each of these production strategies. 
 Forward integration

or facilities that move

that specializes in computer 
products 
 Horizontal integration 
  The purchase of firms in 
the same line of business, 
such as a computer chip 
firm that acquires a

 Production strategies do  not  begin with manufacturing. In the past many MNEs focused 
most heavily on this aspect of operations, failing to realize that an effective production strat-
egy begins with new product development. This conclusion gains in importance when one 
considers that many of today’s best-selling products and services were unavailable a short 
while ago. Examples include laptops, cellular phones, satellite navigation devices, DVD 
players, broadband DSL lines, and specialized discount stores that cater to selective product 
lines such as home-related goods or ofﬁ ce supplies. Many other products and services have 
been greatly improved over the last decade or so. Examples include antidepressant medi-
cation, automobiles, facsimile machines, hazardous waste treatment services, home-delivery 
food services, medical diagnostic equipment, pacemakers, personal computers, photocopiers, 
telephones, and televisions. MNEs have come to realize that if they are not developing new 
goods and services, they must be improving their current offerings. In either case the focus 
is on R&D and innovation. 
 Innovation can be broadly divided into product/service development and process 
development. The former refers to activities that support the creation of new products and 
services that customers want, or improvements to existing products/services that make 
more customers want them instead of those of rival firms. The latter refers to innovation 
activities that improve the way products/services are produced, making them quicker, 
cheaper, or better quality. Continuous innovation lies at the heart of sustained competi-
tive advantage, and managing it effectively has a strong international business component. 
 RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND INNOVATION 

367
CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
 Most large firms are involved in all of these activities. Sony, for example, is continually 
coming up with new technology platforms (CDs, DVDs, minidisks, and so on) and new 
products based around these platforms. But it also invests in improving current product 
lines, with new models and new features, and it strives to make them cheaper through 
economies of scale and continuous improvement in manufacturing. 
 For us, concerned with the international strategy and organization of innovation and 
R&D, there are several key issues. The first is the question of how far products, services, 
and the processes that create them should be standardized across all locations, as opposed 
to customizing these to suit local markets. This lies at the heart of the “integration-respon-
siveness” theme that runs through this book. Despite the highly standardized nature of 
their products, even firms like McDonald’s and Coca-Cola customize these for particular 
markets. Like all firms they have to manage a natural tension between country market 
managers who would like more customization to suit their local customer needs and head-
office managers in the marketing, operations, human resource management, R&D, and 
strategy departments which would prefer to standardize across all markets. 
 A related issue is: where should firms locate different innovation-related activities? The 
answer to this depends on the industry and often the product or service in question. It is worth 
examining this by looking at the factors that influence the organization of R&D around the firm. 
 MNEs tend to operate several types of R&D networks, as shown on  Figure   12.1   . There is an 
innovation hierarchy from basic, long-term, or blue-sky R&D, which is often based around 
finding scientific breakthroughs, to applied, near-market, or demand-led innovation: 
 ■   Blue-sky or basic R&D centers are often linked to universities or government research 
institutes to tap into highly specialized expertise, wherever it is in the world.  
 ■   Technical design and development centers focus on more practical, near-market R&D 
and may be separate or co-located with regional headquarters or major business units.  
 ■   Applied technical development and customization departments, often situated within 
manufacturing centers, will focus on incremental improvements to production processes 
or minor adaptations to products to suit local markets.   
 Home country-based central R&D often sets the overall R&D strategy across a firm, but 
funding and other resources may partly come from country market managers who will

push for more applied R&D activities to adapt products and services for their markets. 
For a large MNE, a few key locations may have R&D units, the firm’s main markets may 
all have one or more applied R&D centers, and production locations will have technical 
centers. The complexity of managing strategy and implementation up and down the inno-
vation hierarchy and across the different country locations should not be underestimated.  
 In terms of both product and process development, MNEs need to prioritize country 
locations according to both (1) local market requirements in terms of adaptation, design 
and development, and engineering support and (2) local technological resources, expertise, 
contract companies, universities, and so on, often called the “national system of innovation.” 
 Hewlett-Packard (HP) is a good example of these kinds of structures. It has six basic 
R&D centers in Palo Alto, California; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Bristol, England; 
Grenoble, France; Haifa, Israel; and Tokyo, Japan. These explore a wide range of technol-
ogies more or less linked to its product range. Its Advanced Studies Research Labs include 
a subgroup doing information theory research, linking the Mathematical Science Group 
based in Bristol with experts at the US universities at Stanford and Berkeley. Grenoble 
specializes in business PC design and development and Israel in image and document 
processing, among other areas. 
 These centers of research excellence are linked to HP’s global product divisions, mainly 
headquartered in the United States, and its national subsidiaries around the world, which 
encompass most of its 85,500 employees. 
 The Palo Alto center pioneered HP’s thermal ink-jet technology, for example. Its 
Consumer Products group headquartered in San Diego, California, designed, developed, 
and led the manufacturing of a range of imaging products using this technology. The firm’s 
subsidiary in Singapore customizes the design and produces thermal inkjet printers for the 
Japanese and Asian markets. 
 The R&D structure of the firm evolved a step further when the Singaporean subsidiary 
took the lead from San Diego for the design, development, and manufacturing of a new 
range of portable inkjet printers. It had built up a range of specialist capabilities, through 
learning from other parts of the internal network and through local Asian technical part-
nerships and subcontractors that made it the best place to lead innovation efforts in this 
area for the firm as a whole. 5 
 The above organization structures are important because they affect how well firms 
leverage their R&D efforts for competitive advantage. The efficiency with which special-
ist knowledge inputs from experts around the firm are coordinated is paramount. For 
example, firms have to focus new product development (NPD) efforts at the point where 
technological opportunities meet market opportunities. Marketing departments and sub-
sidiaries, distributors and retailers in country markets understand customer needs, whereas 
the central R&D department and technical design and development centers around the 
firm understand the potential of various technologies. These areas of specialist knowledge 
have to combine efficiently to direct NPD, and this is often done within cross-functional 
teams. NPD project teams are continually created and disbanded in manufacturing and 
service firms in response to the ever-changing technological and market opportunities 
they are faced with, and the strength of internal and external networks determines how 
well firms manage this process. 6 
 Large MNEs that are good at managing knowledge networks are in a better position 
to leverage the scale and scope advantages that put them ahead of smaller or domestic 
market firms in terms of their innovativeness. They can afford large (scale) and specialist 
(scope) centers of excellence and can manage joint ventures with other big players to pool 
resources and spread the risk of R&D projects. They can then link these R&D centers to 
their markets around the world, prioritizing areas of development on which to focus their 
efforts to reap the most rewards in terms of sales of new and improved products. 

369
CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
 Global innovation management and knowledge management are seen to be increasingly 
important to the long-run performance of all firms. Nohria and Ghoshal use the terms 
 distributed innovation  and  differentiated networks  to characterize how firms should learn 
globally and exploit this learning globally to improve production processes and products 
in all markets.       7  Other studies also emphasize the internal processes, within multinational 
structures, that constrain or facilitate this kind of global capability.       8 
 Speed-to-market 
 One of the major manufacturing challenges facing MNEs is the speed with which they 
develop and get new products to market.       9  In recent years, many ﬁ rms have found that a 
“speed-to-market” strategy can be extremely proﬁ table.  Table  12.1 provides some data to 
support this statement. Notice that a company that enters the market one month ahead of 
the competition can increase annual gross proﬁ ts by $150,000 on a product that generates 
$25 million and $600,000 on a product that generates $100 million. Simply put, by carefully 
designing the product and getting it out of the door fast, the company can dramatically 
increase proﬁ tability. 
 MNEs have taken a number of steps to ensure early delivery of their products. For 
example, Cisco Systems has outsourced the production of routers and switches to 
Flextronics, a contract electronics manufacturer. Flextronics receives an electronic order 
from Cisco, manufactures the product under the Cisco brand, and then delivers it directly 
to the customers. 10  BMW has combined engineering, development, and production plan-
ning in bringing new cars to market in record time.       11 
 The strategic emphasis is on increasing speed by developing   time-to-market accel-
erators  , which are factors that help reduce bottlenecks and errors and ensure product 
quality and performance. These accelerators vary from firm to firm, but they all produce 
the same results. For example, in 2000, Pirelli, the Italian tire maker, unveiled its   modular 
integrated robotized system (MIRB)  , which enables the entire production system to be 
robotized. Small and flexible, MIRB allows smaller batches to be produced in different 
locations, potentially locating them next to Pirelli’s industrial customers. 12 
 In the past, many MNEs placed the bulk of their production attention on the manufac-
turing side of the operation. However, recent research shows that the best way to reduce 
defective products and speed delivery is by placing the greatest attention on product design 
and planning of operations. This is accomplished through what is known as   concurrent 
engineering  , which involves design, engineering, and manufacturing people working 
together to create and build the product. Concurrent engineering is useful for two reasons.

First, if the product is carefully designed, fewer changes are needed later on and the good 
can be brought to market swiftly. Second, the costs associated with changes increase as 
the product gets closer to completion; that is, it is almost twice as expensive to correct a 
problem during production than during product design. 
 Once a product or service has been planned out, the MNE’s attention turns to produc-
tion. This strategy is focused very heavily on minimizing costs and increasing quality and 
productivity.

 How did GE use work-out to increase speed-to-market? 
 The primary way GE used work-out to increase speed-to-market was by looking for ways 
to eliminate production bottlenecks and streamline operations. The strategy of work-out 
asked the participants: how can we change the operation to get more done in less time? 
The workers who were familiar with the operations often had a wealth of information to 
share, and this was sometimes the first time anyone had asked them for their opinions. 
They were delighted to offer suggestions and recommendations. As a result, the company 
produced more products in less time than ever before.      
 Most people think of the production process as one in which physical goods are produced. 
However, the process can also be used in generating services, and the two are quite often 
interlinked. 13  For example, GM manufactures cars but also offers auto maintenance and 
repair services 14  whereas Boeing both builds and services aircraft. In other cases, services are 
primary, such as the Hilton Corporation offering hotel accommodations, Hertz and Avis 
leasing cars, and CNN providing international news coverage. 
 Sometimes goods and/or services are provided directly by the MNE; other times the 
MNE has an arrangement with outside firms or suppliers (some of them being direct com-
petitors) to assist in this process. For example, other firms make some of the HP printers, 
but HP has its name put on the units and assumes responsibility for marketing them.       15 
Service organizations follow a similar strategy. Some airlines purchase their in-flight food 
from companies like Marriott, and some rely on aircraft maintenance firms such as Ryder 
to service their craft. Many motels subcontract their food service to companies that specialize 
in this area, including fast-food franchisors such as McDonald’s and Burger King. So there 
is often a mix of product/service strategies at work when generating goods and services. 
The following discussion examines some of the most important functions that are carried 
out in this process. The production of goods is emphasized most heavily because some of 
the areas under discussion do not lend themselves to services—although one that does is 
global sourcing, a primary area of consideration in production strategy. 
 Global sourcing 
 Sometimes MNEs produce all the goods and services they need. However, they often use 
 global sourcing   by calling upon those suppliers which can provide the needed output 
more efﬁ ciently regardless of where they are geographically located. 16

371
CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
 Global sourcing has become important for a number of reasons. The most obvious one 
is cost. If GM wants to be price competitive in the European Union, one strategy is to build 
and ship cars from Detroit to Europe at a price equal to, or less than, that charged by EU 
competitors. Because this is not possible, GM uses overseas suppliers and assembly plants 
to build much of what it sells in Europe. In deciding who will provide these parts and sup-
plies, the company uses global sourcing, as do other MNEs. 
 Not all global sourcing is provided by outside suppliers. Some MNEs own their own 
source of supply or hold an equity position in a supplier. This relationship does not guar-
antee that the supplier will get the MNE’s business on every bid. However, if the supplier 
is unable to match the cost or quality performance of competitive suppliers, the MNE will 
eventually terminate the relationship. So there is a great deal of pressure on the supplier to 
develop and maintain state-of-the-art production facilities. Additionally, because the sup-
plier works closely with the MNE, the company knows how its multinational client likes 
things done and is able to operate smoothly with the MNE’s design and production people. 
 In recent years some giant MNEs have taken equity positions in a number of different 
suppliers. Japanese multinationals are an excellent example. These firms often have a net-
work of parts suppliers, subcontractors, and capital equipment suppliers they can call on. 
 At the same time these suppliers often provide goods and services to other firms. This helps 
them to maintain their competitive edge by forcing them to innovate, adapt, and remain cost 
effective. If these suppliers are in similar or complementary industries, as in the case of NEC’s 
suppliers, then technological innovations or revolutionary changes in manufacturing processes 
will be quickly accepted or copied by others. So the close proximity of the suppliers coupled 
with their business relationships helps to ensure that they attain and hold positions as world-class 
suppliers, and this advantage carries over to the customers, who gain both innovative ideas and 
high-quality, low-cost supplies. 17 
 A good example is the leather footwear industry in Italy. Manufacturers regularly inter-
act with leather suppliers, designers, and producers of other leather goods. As a result, 
the manufacturers are extremely knowledgeable about industry technology, production 
techniques, fashion trends, and supply sources. 
 These advantages also help explain why many US suppliers are going international. By 
setting up operations near world-class competitors, these suppliers find it easier to monitor 
developments, remain alert to changes in technology and production processes, and main-
tain state-of-the-art facilities. 18  In fact, when manufacturers expand operations to another 
country, it is common to find their major suppliers setting up operations nearby in order 
to continue serving the manufacturers. The other reason is to prevent local competitors 
from capturing some of this business, which often happens when the supplier attempts to 
compete from the home country. 
 The global clothing industry provides a good example of these trends. The production 
of clothing sits within a broader value chain, which includes textiles and fibers for a range 
of both household and industrial goods. Upstream, the textile industry relies on access to 
sources of natural fibers, a “natural” factor endowment in Porter’s Diamond of Advantage, 
compared to the “acquired” factor endowments associated with the chemicals industry for 
the production of artificial fibers. Clearly, each has favored different countries at different 
stages of the industry’s development. Downstream, distribution and retailing and, in par-
ticular, branding and marketing have remained predominantly within the major markets 
of industrially advanced countries (and under their ownership). The case  International 
Business Strategy in Action: Gap Inc. illustrates these patterns. 
 The clothing industry itself can be subdivided into three activities: design, preparation, 
and production. The last two have remained relatively labor intensive, which is why most 
preparation and production are done in cheap-labor locations. China’s share of world 
exports in clothing grew from 4 percent in 1980 to over 18 percent in 2000, and it is now the

 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Gap Inc.: a successful “Hollow Corporation” 
 In 1999, after 28 years, founders Don and Doris Fisher still 
owned 24 percent of Gap Inc. and still played a leading 
role in managing the operations of this $2 billion clothing 
firm. By 2010 Gap’s revenue had grown to $14,197 million 
and the Fisher family was still very much involved. As with 
other high-street clothing firms, its competitive advantage 
stemmed from linking cheap manufacturing in contract 
production facilities in around 45 countries, with design 
and fashion expertise and huge distribution and sales 
chains in the United States and Europe. 
 Just 1 percent of its own employees have any production-
related role: 600 quality control employees in eight shipment 
processing facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia. Gap 
is essentially a distribution, retailing, sales, and, particularly, 
marketing firm—a specialty retailer operating 3,095 stores 
selling casual apparel, personal care products, and acces-
sories. Its brands include Gap, GapKids, BabyGap, Banana 
Republic, Old Navy, Althleta, and Piperlime. Gap measures its 
own success on its sales and its expansion rate, in terms of 
new stores, so in part it is also a real estate business. These 
provide an indication of its ongoing performance, its multina-
tionality at any point in time, and its international expansion 
or retrenchment overtime. In the late 1990s it was opening 
over 100 stores per year. More recently its overall growth 
and its international expansion have slowed (see  Table  1 ). 
For example, due to losses, Forth & Towne brand stores 
were closed by the end of June 2007. In the past 3 years, the 
number of stores decreased from 3,167 store locations in 2007 
to 3,095 stores in 2010 (a decrease of 71 stores, or 2.3 per-
cent). Despite Gap being a well-known brand in Europe, it is 
heavily reliant on its North American sales (87.8 percent), 
with only 10 percent of its stores situated in Europe and Asia, 
where it generates 12.2 percent sales. Gap’s product devel-
opment offices are based in New York City, where product 
 managers, designers, and graphic artists monitor (and create) 
customer trends in its main consumer markets.

 The Sourcing and Logistics Group, together with buying 
agents around the globe, draw up production schedules 
and place orders with the approved third-party clothes 
plants located around the world. Like other mid-range 
department stores, such as Neiman-Marcus or Macy’s in 
the United States, Marks & Spencer in the UK or Karstadt 
in Germany, Gap’s higher-quality, higher-priced garments 
are sourced from countries like South Korea, Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, and parts

United States, Asda and Matalan in the UK, and Carrefour 
in France which source in bulk from lower-cost and lower-
quality locations such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, 
China, India, Mexico, Chile, Hungary, Kenya, and Pakistan. 
The value hierarchy in clothing is mirrored by a global 
hierarchy of locations, ordered by virtue of their cost base 
and local endowments that underpin quality, and speed of 
delivery, from related infrastructure to relevant expertise. 
 Each Gap brand has its own marketing team based in 
the San Francisco Bay area, which creates advertising 
posters, in-store design and graphics, and magazine and 
TV commercials. Distribution centers receive goods from 
overseas production plants, check the quality, sort the 
goods and redistribute them to retail outlets in each of 
the country markets, the United States, Canada, Japan, the 
UK, and the Netherlands. The subcontracting arrangement

and technical support but mainly relies on imposing strict

world’s dominant exporter. Over 2 million Chinese are employed in the sector. By contrast 
the United States has the biggest trade deficit in clothing ($48 billion in 2004). Scotland and 
Italy, two dominant forces in textiles and clothing at one time, for example, have shifted 
upmarket to specialize in design and high-quality/fashion items. Employment has fallen 
drastically in these countries as a result and the patterns of trade have also reversed.
When MNEs turn to global sourcing, there is typically a hierarchical order of consider­
ation. The company gives first preference to internal sources, such as having subassemblies 
produced by the manufacturing department or the subsidiary that specializes in this work. 
However, if a review of outside sources reveals a sufficient cost/quality difference that 
would justify buying from an external supplier, this is what the company will do. In fact, 
sometimes an MNE will not attempt to make a particular part or product because it lacks 
the expertise to do so efficiently. The firm will simply solicit bids from outside suppliers 
and award the contract based on predetermined specifications (price, quality, delivery 
time, etc.). Over time the MNE will learn which suppliers are best at providing certain 
goods and services and will turn to them immediately. When this process is completed, 
attention will then focus on the actual manufacture of the goods.
Recently, environmentalists have reviewed the global supply chains of MNEs. They argue 
that all suppliers to an MNE should follow environmentally sensitive policies—in other 
words, be “green.” 
Some firms face high risks due to dependence on global outsourcing. Outsourcing to 
suppliers may open up opportunities for competitors. Similarly, outsourcing production 
to different suppliers may prevent the development of new insights, innovations, and solu-
tions which typically require cross-functional teamwork. Finally, outsourcing may risk key 
knowledge leakage. The case International Business Strategy in Action, The dark side of 
outsourcing: Boeing’s problems with its 787 examines this issue.
Manufacturing of goods
MNEs face a variety of concerns in manufacturing goods and services. Primary among 
these are cost, quality, and efficient production systems.
Cost
Multinationals seek to control their costs by increasing the efficiency of their produc-
tion processes. Often this means using new, improved technology such as state-of-the-art 
machinery and equipment. Although these purchases can be expensive, they may be the 
best way to raise productivity and lower costs, thus maintaining competitive advantage. 
A good example is provided by the automobile industry in Brazil, which is the heart of 
the South American automobile market. The country is host to 13 auto makers, including 
Daimler, Chrysler, Volkswagen, and Ford, which are investing over $20 billion to update 
Brazilian plants to modular manufacturing. Modular manufacturing allows suppliers of 
parts to take on some of the assembly. Dana Corporation, which has set up shop near a 
Chrysler factory in the city of Curitiba, is now responsible for the assembly of the Dakota’s 
quality and cost limitations which independent suppliers 
must adhere to in order to maintain their contracts.
There are clear similarities in this strategy with Nike 
(see Real Case: Nike, below). Nike, however, has closer 
ties with its first-tier suppliers often including some equity-
share, technology transfer, management, and design train-
ing. Nike is also well known for its poor record on ethical 
labor practices, through well-publicized studies of its 
South-East Asian “sweatshops.” These triggered damaging 
reprisals from shareholders and customers, sending out 
a warning sign to many consumer goods manufacturers 
which relied on a strong brand that exploitation of cheap 
labor can sometimes be highly unprofitable.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 The dark side of outsourcing: Boeing’s problems 
with its 787 
 In general, offshoring (which is outsourcing across national 
borders) is potentially beneficial when a firm needs to 
economize on costs, especially labour costs in manufac-
turing, assembly, or in routine service delivery. However, 
offshoring can prove to be a disaster for a firm when 
proprietary technology, engineering skills, managerial 
capabilities in systems integration, and other aspects of 
firm specific advantages, are put at risk of dissipation by 
engaging with independent contractors, especially those 
embedded in foreign cultures and environments. 
 Such was the case with the Being 787. This “Dreamliner” 
advanced airplane suffered from over three years of delays 
when dozens of foreign component manufacturers failed 
to deliver quality components on time. Boeing itself had to 
reintegrate many of the outsourced components back into 
its basic assembly systems in order to re-establish quality 
control and timely delivery. These costs of delay of delivery 
of the 787 Dreamliner amount to between $10 million and 
$18 billion. 
 Why did such a sophisticated world leading company 
such as Boeing make such a basic mistake in throwing 
away decades of internal, integrated, processed based 
R&D and engineering skills by adopting a misguided out-
sourcing strategy? The failed outsourcing strategy, started 
in 2003, led to the termination of its champion, Boeing 
Chairman, Harry Stonecipher, in 2005. 
 It appears that the top management team at Boeing 
used outsourcing as a technique to improve its Return on 
Net Assets (RONA). This ratio can obviously be improved if 
in-company assets (in the form of factories and employees 
directly owned by Boeing) are reduced and outsourced to 
independent contractors. Unfortunately, the unsatisfactory 
nature of some of the outsourced production of compo-
nents for the Boeing 787 led to a fall in revenues and thus 
a poor RONA. It also resulted in the loss of vital in-house 
engineering knowhow, a hollowing out of Boeing, and the 
loss of reputation and brand equity due to the first major 
failure in the history of Boeing’s products. 
 It has been alleged that this catastrophic, strategic 
mistake in turning to outsourcing was due to the experi-
ence of McDonell Douglas. This St. Louis, Missouri-based 
aerospace company was acquired by Boeing. McDonnel 
Douglas had been very successful in supplying military air-
craft to the US Department of Defence. Once a contract to 
supply military hardware was obtained, McDonnel Douglas 
was able to obtain full payment for its development costs. 
Once Boeing made the strategic decision to outsource, it 
did not anticipate that it would have to bear the cost of any 
risks involved. In order to improve RONA. Boeing forgot 
that such strategic errors in outsourcing would come back 
to haunt its revenues and stock price, which were no longer 
guaranteed by the US government. All in all, outsourcing is 
the wrong strategy for technologically intensive producers.

basic skeleton, which represents approximately 30 percent of the total cost of production. 
Once this skeleton reaches Chrysler, it is mounted with an engine and a body. Entire assem-
bly lines had to be rebuilt to accommodate this process. Volkswagen, Ford, and General 
Motors are also developing similar assembly plants to test their efﬁ ciency for future imple-
mentation to their other factories. 19 
 A second approach is to tap low-cost labor sources. A good example is the  maquiladora 
industry (as discussed in  Chapter 10 ) that has sprung up in Mexico just across the US bor-
der. Hundreds of US plants have been established in this area. Examples include TRW Inc., 
which has a factory where workers assemble seat belts, and Mattel, which has a plant where 
workers turn out Barbie-doll houses and Disney teething rings. 20  Labor costs in these facil-
ities are less than 20 percent of those of similar workers in the United States. Also, because 
this is a free trade zone, US duties are levied on the imports only to the extent of the value 
added in Mexico, so low wage rates in Mexico help keep down the import duty. 

375
CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
 A third approach is the development of new methods used to cut costs.       21  For example, 
in the United States, it is typical for a firm to calculate selling price after a new product is 
developed. If the price is judged to be too high, the product is sent back to the drawing 
board to be reworked, or the company accepts a smaller profit on the product. A different 
system has been introduced in Japan, where firms begin by determining the target cost 
of the product  before  going into design, engineering, and supplier pricing, and the latter 
groups then work to bring the product in at the desired price. This unique cost manage-
ment system has helped Japanese firms cut costs for some time ( Figure  12.2 ). 22 
 A fourth method that is gaining popularity with MNEs is that of costing products not 
on an individual basis but as part of a portfolio of related goods. Instead of evaluating 
the expenses of developing one new soft drink, for example, a company looks at the 
costs and revenues associated with the entire line of beverages. Coca-Cola of Japan pro-
vides an example. Every year it introduces more than 1,000 new soft drinks, fruit drinks, 
and cold coffees into the Japanese market. Ninety percent of them fail, but this does 
not stop Coke from introducing approximately one new product a month. From a cost 
accounting standpoint this is not a profitable strategy. However, as one Coke executive 
in Japan puts it, “We know that some of these products will survive only a month or 
two, but our competitors have them, so we have to have them.”       23  As a result, Japan is 
Coke’s most profitable market and the company sells a variety of non-carbonated drinks 
to complement its main brand. 24   
 Quality 
 For well over a decade, quality has been one of the major criteria for business success.       25 
As the president of an international consulting ﬁ rm puts it, “Products are expected to be 
 Figure 12.2  Cost reduction approaches: the United States versus Japan

nearly perfect.” 26  Nowhere is this more clearly reﬂ ected than in the auto industry, where 
the Japanese have garnered a large share of the international market by using what is 
called    kaizen  , or continuous improvement. 27  A good example is Toyota Motors, which 
has continually worked to reduce costs and improve quality. One way Toyota has achieved 
this goal is partly through large R&D expenditures. Another is through meticulous 
design, engineering, and production processes that ensure a proper ﬁ t of all parts and 
overall durability of the unit. 28  In recent years US auto manufacturers have also suc-
ceeded in improving their quality, gaining market share as a result. European car makers 
today are also heavily focused on quality, aware that the Japanese are a major threat to 
their markets. 29   
 Other excellent examples of MNEs that have succeeded because of a strong focus on 
quality include such lesser-known firms as Stanley Works, the WD-40 Co., and A. T. 
Cross. Stanley Works manufactures tape measures in Asia, then has the accuracy of samples 
checked by sophisticated laser computers back in New Britain, Connecticut, before selling 
them worldwide. Stanley has also developed a host of other high-quality products, from 
double-toothed saws that cut on both the upstroke and the downstroke for the Asian 
market, to hammers without claws for carpenters in Central Europe (who prefer to use 
pliers to pull out bent nails), to levels shaped like elongated trapezoids, which the French 
market prefers. 
 The WD-40 Co. of San Diego manufactures WD-40, a water-displacing lubricant that 
fights rust, cleans heel marks from linoleum and walls, and provides a variety of other 
services around the house. Car mechanics use it to loosen sticky valves and remove mois-
ture from balky carburetors; odd jobbers apply it to frozen locks and screws. Today the 
blue-and-yellow spray can is found in stores throughout the world, where it enjoys fanat-
ical customer loyalty. WD-40 is a best-seller in the UK and is rapidly gaining market share 
throughout Europe and Asia. 30 
 A. T. Cross of Providence, Rhode Island, has been manufacturing mechanical pens 
and pencils for almost 150 years. The units are assembled by hand and “every one of the 
company’s hourly employees is a quality control expert who is responsible for checking 
the tolerances of the engraved grooves to within one ten-thousandth of an inch and for 
detecting nearly microscopic scratches or the slightest clotting of ink on a pen ball.”       31  A. T. 
Cross’s product quality is so high that, despite a lifetime guarantee, less than 2 percent of 
its products are ever returned for repair. Today these pens and pencils are one of the most 
popular US-made gifts in Japan. 32 
 Production systems 
 A  production system   is a group of related activities designed to create value. In the gen-
eration of goods and services this system includes location, layout, and material handling.  
 Location 
 Location is important because of its impact on production and distribution costs. Many 
MNEs have found that governments (national and local) are willing to provide tax breaks 
or other ﬁ nancial incentives to encourage them to set up operations. Accompanying con-
siderations include the availability and cost of labor, raw materials, water, and energy as well 
as the development of the country’s transportation and communication systems. As noted 
earlier, many suppliers set up operations near their major customers. So Ford has built 
up an integrated production network in Western Europe (see the map on the Ford Fiesta 
production network). Ford suppliers are part of this production network so as to maintain 
their business relationship. Location is also important to service enterprises because they 
usually require face-to-face contact with their customers. Hotels and airlines are typical 
examples. Personal service ﬁ rms such as those of accountants, lawyers, and management 
consultants also fall into this category. 33

CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
 Layout 
 Plant layout is important because of its impact on efﬁ ciency. For example, most auto pro-
ducers use an assembly line layout in which the workers remain at their station and, as 
the cars move past them, perform the necessary functions such as installing radios, air-
conditioners, interior trim, and so on. In the case of Volvo, the employees work in small 
teams to build an entire car and the plant is laid out to accommodate this work ﬂ ow. 34 In 
other manufacturing settings, however, worldwide competitive ﬁ rms tend to use U-shaped-
cell ﬂ ow lines, which are more efﬁ cient. Schonberger, an internationally known manufactur-
ing expert, has noted that U-shaped production designs enable one person to tend several 
workstations and increase the speed at which materials can be delivered and defective parts 
can be reworked. 35  Finally, Maytag has chosen to combine different layouts to cater to each 
production line in just one factory. A traditional long conveyer belt assembly line makes its 
standardized models. A second area makes more sophisticated models in smaller produc-
tion cells instead of a long line. The third area makes the most sophisticated machines. In 
this setting, workers are craftworkers putting together a substantial part of the machine. 36 
 Layout varies widely in service organizations, although it appears to be universal in use. 
Most hotels, regardless of the country, have the check-in and check-out areas in the same 
place as such support groups as the bellhops, concierge, and cashier. In fast-food units, the 
food preparation area is situated so that the personnel can quickly serve both in-unit and 
drive-through customers. In movie theaters, the concession area is located in the lobby and 
the projection room at the back of the theater.  

378
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Material handling 
 Material handling   involves the careful planning of when, where, and how much inventory 
will be available to ensure maximum production efﬁ ciency. Part of this is resolved through 
careful inventory control processes. Part of it is handled when the production layout is deter-
mined. For example, General Electric uses   process mapping , a ﬂ owchart that shows every 
small step in producing a product. As a result, the company is able to study every part of an 
operation and determine those that are redundant or that can be streamlined. Consequently, 
the company has been able to reduce work time on some jobs by as much as 50 percent.       37     
 Inventory control 
 Inventory control has received a great deal of attention in recent years because a well-
designed inventory strategy can have dramatic effects on the bottom line.       38  One of the 
most popular concepts has been   just-in-time inventory (JIT   for short), which is based 
on delivering parts and supplies just as they are needed. If this concept were carried to the 
extreme, it would mean that manufacturers would not need to store materials because sup-
pliers would be delivering them just in time for shipment to the factory ﬂ oor.  
 JIT is an important concept that has been adopted by MNEs throughout the world. 
However, the degree of use varies based on the product and the company’s production strat-
egy. For example, the Big Three US auto makers use JIT to keep inventory to a minimum. 
In Japan, firms like Toyota have taken the concept even further and apply it the same way 
airlines handle reservations: supply is matched directly to demand. Dealers order directly 
from the factory, which means that customers can get their built-to-order car in 7 to 10 days. 
 One of the major problems with JIT is that its success rests heavily on the quality and 
reliability of the suppliers. In Japan, where MNEs often have an equity position in these 
companies, suppliers will go out of their way to meet partners’ demands. However, in the 
United States and Europe, most suppliers are independent businesses that work under a 
contract relationship, so the bonds are often not as strong between the two parties. This 
helps explain why Toyota, which buys US-made parts for cars made in the United States, 
also keeps Japanese-made parts on hand as insurance against defective US materials.       39 
 A second problem with JIT is that, although it works well in managing delivery of parts 
to the assembly line, few firms have been able to apply the concept to the entire production 
process. Most firms still manufacture and ship their output to dealers to sell, in contrast to 
Toyota’s approach of matching supply and demand before producing. 
 One of the most important things to remember about JIT is that it needs strong support 
from the workers and the suppliers. Everyone must be operating in unison. If the workers 
are slow, there will be excess inventory on hand; if the supplier is late, the workers will be 
sitting by idly. 
 Demand-Flow™ Technology (DFT)   is a production process that allows for flexible 
changes in the middle stages of production. Typically used to produce standardized assembly 
products, such as computers, DFT permits quick reactions to changes in demand and tech-
nology. A surge of demand for Pentium IV computers, for instance, would immediately shift 
inputs from other computers to be combined with Pentium IV chips to respond to demand. 
This virtually eliminates inventories. 40  Intermec, a company that makes bar code scanners, 
mobile computers, and related products, reduced inventory by 50 percent after implement-
ing DFT. It was also able to consolidate five different printer lines into one flexible mixed-
model line, decreasing the amount of required manufacturing floor space by 20 percent. 41    
  Developing a strong service orientation 
 As noted earlier, many products have a service element associated with them. Sometimes 
this element is more important than the product itself. For example, many people will not

CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
purchase a car or home appliance unless it can be serviced easily. Service is also important 
when choosing a bank, insurance agent, lawyer, or doctor. Many of the ideas we have dis-
cussed in this section, including sourcing, cost, and quality, are also key factors in shopping 
for services. In addressing this area, MNEs will do two things: (1) consider whether their 
strategy needs to be oriented toward a product, a service, or a combination of the two; and 
(2) determine the ideal degree of service to provide. 
  Determining the product/service balance 
 Some outputs lend themselves to a strong production orientation, whereas others require 
much more attention to service.  Figure   12.3    offers an illustration. Designed more as a point 
of reference than as a factual source that addresses every ﬁ rm in the respective industry, 
the ﬁ gure nonetheless shows that some MNEs need to have a strong product-dominated 
focus whereas others beneﬁ t most from a service orientation. A good example is offered by 
aircraft manufacturers that must be concerned with both ends of the continuum. Olympus 
and Pentax, both manufacturers of ﬂ exible endoscopic equipment, provide another ex-
ample. To develop their brand names in Latin America, these companies offer medical 
professionals the surgical training necessary to use their equipment. Because after-sales 
service is also an important consideration for prospective buyers, including hospitals, all 
major endoscope manufacturers have service stations in the region. 
 On the other hand, some manufactured products require far less service than they used 
to need. A good example is photocopiers. Manufacturers of these machines have improved 
product quality so substantially that many units are now sold on the basis of price. Service 
is no longer a major factor because everyone’s product is of such high quality. 
 Knowing whether to sell on the basis of product or service (or a combination of the two) 
is critical to the success of many MNEs. A mistake at this point can result in emphasis on 
the wrong sales factors.  
  Providing the right amount of service 
 Once the MNE has determined the proper balance of product and service domination, it 
evaluates the speciﬁ c type of service warranted. This is particularly important because many 
MNEs ﬁ nd that the strategy used in their own country does not work overseas. A good 
example is the Japanese approach to retail services.       42 The amount of personal service pro-
vided in Japan would surprise many Westerners. For example, auto dealers typically provide 
pick-up and delivery for repair service customers and make new car sales calls to customers’ 
homes. In department stores, it is common to ﬁ nd executives and sales clerks alike lined up 
to bow to the ﬁ rst customers in the store. Japanese banks often help their customers sell or 
buy homes, ﬁ nd distributors for merchandise, and provide them with tax advice. 
 Although these services help Japanese companies maintain customer satisfaction, 
research has found that they are of little value to doing business in other countries. For 
example, Japanese banks in the United States have discovered that US customers want only 
a limited amount of quality service; they prefer quantity and efficiency in the form of a 
variety of different services offered at low prices. As a result, Japanese banks here offer the 
 Figure 12.3  Product- and service-dominated businesses 

380
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
same types of services as do other US banks. Would they be more successful if they changed 
this strategy and tried to emulate the approach used back home? Given the nature of the 
US market, they believe this would be a mistake. The lesson is clear: when competing in 
terms of service, one must match the competition but not exceed it unless the customer is 
willing to pay for this service. In the United States, the banking customer is not willing.       43

 How has GE used Six Sigma to reduce cost and improve quality in consumer 
goods? In each case, give an example. 
 Six Sigma allows GE to use process mapping to reduce cost by identifying those activities 
that can be eliminated or combined in the production process. For example, can an indi-
vidual who is performing one assembly line task take on other tasks and thus reduce the 
number of people needed to produce the product? Can inventory be ordered and delivered 
in smaller amounts, thus making greater use of just-in-time? Consideration of these types 
of questions can help reduce cost. In improving product quality, the work group can exam-
ine how well all parts of the product fit together, examine the durability of the unit, and look 
for additional ways of testing the product to ensure that it measures up to quality standards.       
 International logistics   is the designing and managing of a system to control the ﬂ ow of 
materials and products throughout the ﬁ rm. This includes the inﬂ ow of materials, move-
ment through the production process, and outﬂ ow to the wholesale/retail ﬁ rm or ﬁ nal con-
sumer. International logistics is an important area of strategic consideration because these 
expenses can account for 10 percent of the total costs.       44  The material management aspect of 
international logistics has already been addressed. The following discussion examines three 
other key topics: transportation, packaging, and storage. 
 Transportation 
 In examining international logistics, we focus on the primary modes of transportation: 
ocean and air. The others—rail, pipeline, and motor carrier—are of importance in some 
regions (such as the European Union), but they are not as commonly used in moving goods 
from an MNE’s plant to their ﬁ nal destination. Moreover, their use is highly dependent on 
the infrastructure of the country—that is, the extensiveness and quality of the nation’s road 
system and rail network. In many non-triad countries the infrastructure is poor and the 
MNE’s use of them is greatly limited. 
 Ocean shipping 
 International ﬁ rms can choose from a fairly wide variety of ocean carriers. The three most 
common carriers are conventional container ships, cargo vessels, and roll-on-roll-off 
(RORO) vessels.   Container ships   are used to carry standardized containers that can be 
simply loaded onto the carrier and then unloaded at their destination, without any repack-
aging of the contents of the containers.   Unconventional cargo vessels   are used for ship-
ping oversized and unusual cargoes.   Roll-on-roll-off (RORO) vessels are ocean-going

ferries that can carry wheeled cargo such as automobiles, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, 
trailers, or railroad cars that drive onto built-in ramps and roll off at the point of debar-
kation. A carrier similar to the RORO is the   lighter aboard ship (LASH) vessel , which 
consists of barges that are stored on the ship and lowered at the point of destination. These 
individual barges can then operate on inland waterways.     
 One of the major problems in planning an ocean shipping strategy is the limitations 
caused by the lack of ports and port services. In developing countries, for example, seaports 
sometimes lack the equipment necessary to load or unload container cargo, thus limit-
ing the country’s ability to export and import. In recent years a number of Third World 
countries have been working to improve their ports so they can become more active in the 
international trade arena. 
 Air shipping 
 Most countries have airports that can accommodate air freight. The problem with this mode of 
transportation is its high cost. Thus, although international air freight has grown dramatically 
over the last 30 years, it still accounts for less than 1 percent of the total volume of international 
shipments. It is used in trade more commonly among industrialized nations than any others, 
and it is usually restricted to high-value items that must reach their destination quickly. 
 Several developments have occurred over the past couple of decades that have helped 
increase the use of air shipments. These include more efficient ground facilities, larger 
aircraft, and better marketing of these services to shippers. In particular, the development 
by aircraft manufacturers of jumbo cargo jet planes and combination passenger and cargo 
aircraft has helped immensely.  
 Choice criteria 
 In deciding the best transportation mode to use, MNEs tend to focus on four important 
criteria: time, predictability, cost, and non-economic factors. 
 Time 
 The period between departure and arrival of a carrier can vary signiﬁ cantly between an 
ocean freighter and an aircraft. So one of the questions a ﬁ rm must answer is: how quickly 
is delivery needed? A number of factors can inﬂ uence the answer. One is the perishability of 
the product. Exotic ﬂ owers from South America are ﬂ own to the United States because they 
would not survive a sea voyage. A second factor is how soon the goods are needed to replen-
ish current stocks. Autos from Japan are brought into the United States by ship because the 
length of the trip does not hurt the supply of cars on hand at local dealerships. 
 In businesses where speed is critical, companies are now coordinating their worldwide 
supply chains in order to reduce the amount of time needed to get the goods through the 
production cycle and to the customer. Victor Fung, CEO of Li & Fung, Hong Kong’s larg-
est export trading company and an innovator in the development of supply-chain manage-
ment, has provided an example of how this is being done: 
  Say we get an order from a European retailer to produce 10,000 garments. It’s not a simple matter 
of our Korean office sourcing Korean products or our Indonesian office sourcing Indonesian prod-
ucts. For this customer we might decide to buy yarn from a Korean producer but have it woven and 
dyed in Taiwan. So we pick the yarn and ship it to Taiwan. The Japanese have the best zippers and 
buttons, but they manufacture them mostly in China. Okay, so we go to YKK, a big Japanese zipper 
manufacturer, and we order the right zippers from their Chinese plants. Then we determine that, 
because of quotas and labor conditions, the best place to make the garments is Thailand. So we ship 
everything there. And because the customer needs quick delivery, we may divide the order across 
five factories in Thailand. Effectively, we are customizing the value chain to best meet the customer’s 
needs. Five weeks after we have received the order, 10,000 garments arrive on the shelves in Europe, 
all looking like they came from one factory, with colors, for example, perfectly matched. 45

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Predictability 
 Although both air and water transportation are basically reliable, they are subject to the vagar-
ies of nature. Bad weather can close an airport; inadequate seaport facilities can slow the load-
ing and unloading of cargo. Because of the great difference in delivery time between the two 
modes, the choice is often obvious. If a company needs to have a package delivered tomorrow, 
it will come by air; if the ﬁ rm wants to clear merchandise out of the warehouse today but the 
international customer does not need it for 90 days, it will be sent by water. However, certain 
carriers are more reliable than others, and the MNE will use its experience in determining 
which companies to choose for delivery. Reliability is particularly important for air shipments, 
where a difference of one day could signiﬁ cantly inﬂ uence the salability of the product.  
 Cost 
 The expense associated with shipping is a major consideration when choosing an inter-
national transportation mode. Because air freight is signiﬁ cantly more costly than shipment 
by water, the cost must be economically justiﬁ able. Typically, an MNE will use air shipments 
only when time is critical and/or the product has high value. For example, if the company has 
purchased expensive watches in Zurich for its specialty outlets in New York and San Francisco, 
the watches will be ﬂ own to the retailers. Similarly, if a London-based MNE has bought a 
US-made supercomputer for the home ofﬁ ce and wants it installed immediately, the unit will 
be ﬂ own over from the United States. On the other hand, if the merchandise is bulky or the 
cost of air freight is a signiﬁ cant portion of the value of the product, it will be sent by water. 
Autos are exported by ship, as are bulk commodities and resources such as oil and coal.  
 Non-economic factors 
 Sometimes non-economic factors inﬂ uence the choice of transportation mode. For ex-
ample, in the United States all government cargo must use national ﬂ ag carriers when avail-
able, so there is seldom a question of how to send these goods. Similarly, other governments 
own or subsidize their carriers, and there is pressure on MNEs to use these transportation 
modes when doing business with those countries. Such political considerations must be 
taken into account when formulating the transportation strategy.    
 Packaging 
 Packaging is important in ensuring that a product is shipped in a safe container and arrives 
undamaged. When goods are transported a long distance or to areas with climates different 
from the one where they are manufactured, the container can prevent spoilage or leakage. 
Chemicals, for example, must be carefully sealed in containers that can withstand impact 
and will not crack open if tipped over or dropped. Machines, such as personal computers, 
must have interior packing that prevents damage during transit. 
 Packaging is also important because of its direct effect on cost. If units must be shipped 
in odd-shaped containers, fewer of them can be loaded into the hold of the transport 
than if they are shipped in square or rectangular containers and can be loaded atop and 
alongside each other. The weight of the packing material is also important, especially when 
goods are being shipped by air and costs are based on both distance and weight. 
 Packaging is also important in reducing loading and unloading costs and minimizing theft 
and pilferage. In recent years many shippers have begun using   intermodal containers , which 
are large metal boxes that fit on trucks, railroad trains, and aircraft and help cut handling costs 
and theft losses by placing the merchandise in an easy-to-move unit that is tightly sealed.  
 As more goods are shipped internationally, packaging will continue to be a focal point 
of attention. Such considerations can help an MNE maximize shipping space and mini-
mize transportation costs.

CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
 Storage 
 In some cases, goods that are shipped internationally have to be stored before being moved 
to their ﬁ nal destinations. In the United States, public storage is widely available. In other 
countries, including Japan, warehousing facilities are in short supply. Additionally, the 
conﬁ guration of many warehouses is different from that in the United States. Ceilings are 
often lower and there is little automation for handling such common chores as loading and 
unloading packages or stacking containers on top of each other. In such cases, the MNE 
must decide whether to invest in warehouse facilities or ship goods only when needed, thus 
eliminating the warehouse function. 
 As discussed in  Chapter 6 , some countries have   foreign trade zones  , which are areas 
where foreign goods may be held and processed and then re-exported without incurring 
customs duties (same as a free trade zone). These zones are usually found at major ports 
of entry (including international air terminals). Their effective use can help an MNE: 
(1) temporarily store its goods while breaking a large shipment into smaller ones to be 
shipped to other locales; (2) combine small shipments into larger ones and then reship 
them; (3) process the goods and perform a host of value-added activities before repackag-
ing them for the market; and (4) give those goods that will remain in the local market a 
“made in” status so that they can be sold as locally produced products.  
 An effective storage strategy can be particularly helpful in carrying out the final stages 
of an MNE’s production plan. The strategy can also help minimize overall product cost, 
reduce delivery time, and increase customer satisfaction. 46

 Location is a key factor in deciding the global structure of ﬁ rms’ production systems. But it 
needs to be considered alongside other factors which vary considerably by industry. 
 Companies tend to focus on the functions and innovation activities where they have the 
major advantage and often outsource activities, or parts of the value chain where they add 
less value. This determines the “boundaries” of the firm, what activities are internalized, 
and what are externalized or left to other firms to provide on a contract basis.  Figure   12.4    
shows a number of example industries and firms that have very different global production 
systems, determined by the functions and activities that add the most value.

PRODUCTION SYSTEMS

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Although Intel does a lot of marketing, its main competitive advantage lies in the con-
tinual development of new semiconductors, the heart of PCs and other IT and electronic 
devices. Product and process development are internalized and highly centralized because 
this suits the type of technology and product that the firm focuses on. It alone accounts 
for around 25 percent of all R&D investment in the semiconductor industry. Much of its 
high-value manufacturing, particularly wafer production and fabrication, is done in the 
United States, where 75 percent of its manufacturing workforce is based. Other production 
sites are in Israel and Ireland. Much of its labor-intensive assembly and testing takes place 
in Malaysia, the Philippines, China, and Costa Rica, but is owned by Intel (internalized).  
 Ericsson also keeps much of its research, design, and development activities within the 
firm but not so long ago decided to let other firms make many of the components that 
make up its telecom systems. In 2001 Flextronics, a $14.5 billion Singaporean firm, took 
over much of Ericsson’s manufacturing and supply-chain activities in Brazil, Malaysia, 
Sweden, and the UK. It externalized these activities because it decided they were not part of 
its core competencies, and it could safely contract other firms to supply these components. 
(See Real Case: Flextronics at the end of this chapter.) 
 Gap Inc. and other clothing firms have externalized the manufacturing function for 
many years now. Their focus is clothing design, marketing, branding, and real estate 
management. There are enough producers in cheap labor locations (such as China, 
which exports more garments than any other country by far) for Gap to use the market 
to contract out this activity to the cheapest and/or best. Intermediaries in this industry, 
like Flextronics in telecoms, include Mast Industries, which works with 400 factories in 
37 countries, and Li & Fung, a $5 billion Hong Kong company that connects around 700 
US and European brand owners with a network of 7,500 suppliers (1.5 million workers) 
around the world (of which 2,000 are active at anyone time). 
 Toyota lies in the middle of these two extremes. Because manufacturing, and particu-
larly maintaining continuous improvement in manufacturing, is so central to its competi-
tive advantage, Toyota is partly vertically integrated down the supply chain. New product 
development (new car models and features) and process development (improving price 
and quality) are closely linked and involve good relationships with (and/or ownership of 
some) component suppliers. It cannot externalize car production because it is the source 
of many of its core competitive advantages. 
 Finally, for diversified or multiproduct firms, configuring the right kind of global 
production system can get complicated. Philips, for example, makes semiconductors, like 
Intel, but also has large consumer electronics and consumer products divisions. It has to 
manage both technology-driven and market-driven innovation and production activities.  
 MNEs are currently focusing on a number of areas in improving their production strat-
egies. Three that are getting particular attention include (1) technology and design, (2) con-
tinuous improvement of operations, and (3) the use of strategic alliances and acquisitions. 
  Technology and production design 
 MNEs are now spending more money on R&D than they have in the past. For example, 
Aventis, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and Pﬁ zer spend over 15 percent of their revenues on R&D, 
which provides the backroom for the introduction of new pharmaceutical products. 47 Yet, 
R&D is not only developing new products, but also helping ﬁ rms ﬁ nd alternative parts as 
well as production techniques. 
 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION 
STRATEGY 

385
CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
 A second current trend is the use of concurrent engineering, which was discussed earlier 
in the chapter. Many MNEs are now realizing that a team approach to product develop-
ment, which combines the talents of research, design, and manufacturing people as well 
as customers and clients, results in a more successful product. Ford Motors is an excellent 
example. Ford put together a group called Team Taurus to develop its Taurus and Sable 
automobile lines. Team members were drawn from designing, engineering, and produc-
tion and were brought together with customers. Collectively the group discussed how to 
build the new cars and replaced the sequential approach to manufacturing autos (first 
design the cars, then produce them, then market them) with a concurrent approach that 
involved addressing the design, production, and marketing issues all at the same time. The 
result of this strategy was a Taurus that captured a significant market niche and helped 
Ford close the gap between itself and the competition.       48 
 Coupled with these strategies are innovative human resource development programs 
that are designed around the concept of   empowerment  , which involves giving employees 
greater control over their work. This strategy is particularly effective because it creates a feel-
ing of pride and ownership in the job and makes employees feel they are important assets. 
The use of empowerment is not limited to the research and design areas; it is important in all 
phases of production, beginning with product creation. Additionally, if things go smoothly 
at this early stage of the production cycle, there are likely to be fewer problems later on.  
 Continuous improvement 
 Due to the success of Japanese MNEs,  kaizen  (continuous improvement) has been emulated 
by MNEs worldwide. No matter what the good or service is, every day the company tries to 
do the job better. Some consultants have referred to this strategy as “rapid inch-up,”       49 which 
certainly captures the essence of the concept. US ﬁ rms in particular have beneﬁ ted from 
this idea. A good example can be found in the automotive industry. In the 1980s and 1990s, 
Toyota and Honda were able to offset the rising value of the yen with cost saving in their 
factories, thus allowing them to hold the price line on many of their new cars. These inno-
vations were exported to US plants. By the early 2000s, however, US ﬁ rms had successfully 
fought back by imitating and improving Japanese production techniques. In 2004, four of 
the ﬁ ve most efﬁ cient auto plants in the United States were owned by GM. 50 
 A large number of firms helped account for these results. One is Xerox, internationally 
known for its photocopiers. At the beginning of the 1980s the company was losing market 
share to overseas competitors. However, the firm then began implementing a production 
strategy for dramatically improving quality and reducing cost. Today Xerox is again a 
world leader in copiers. 
 Another example is TPG, which services Ford’s Toronto factory by arranging for 800 
deliveries a day from 300 parts makers. The parts arrive at 12 different stages of production 
within 10 minutes of scheduled time to decrease the amount of parts inventory in the plant.       51 
 As discussed in an earlier section, JIT is a related concept that the MNEs are using to 
achieve continuous improvement. In the past JIT was used almost exclusively for manag-
ing inventory, but now the concept is being employed in other ways. For example, Toyota’s 
use of JIT helps it assemble a car in 13 labor-hours, compared to 19 to 22 labor-hours for 
Honda, Nissan, and Ford.  
 Alliances and acquisitions 
 Another current strategic production trend is the development of alliances and acqui-
sitions. Many MNEs are ﬁ nding they cannot compete effectively without entering into 
joint ventures or other alliances with MNEs that can complement their production

strategy. For example, Compaq is well known for its personal computers, but many of 
the components in these machines are purchased from outside suppliers or are devel-
oped by these firms under an alliance agreement. When Compaq needed a hard disk 
drive for its first laptops, it financed Conner Peripherals, a Silicon Valley start-up with 
a disk drive already underway, rather than develop the machine inhouse. More recently, 
Compaq has ventured into the market for powerful desktop workstations used primarily 
by scientists and engineers. Instead of going head-to-head with market leaders such 
as Sun Microsystems and HP, the company assembled a dozen hardware and software 
firms, including these two computer giants, and put together an alliance aimed at defin-
ing a new technical standard for highspeed desktop computing. The objective of the 
alliance is to develop a standard that will suit any workstation, thus allowing customers 
the freedom to buy the latest, fastest machine without fear of being tied to any single 
manufacturer.
Compaq’s approach is not unique; the Japanese keiretsu system has been using it for 
years.52 In fact, some researchers claim that industry alliances account for more of the suc-
cess of Japanese firms than does JIT or any other manufacturing technique. Working in 
unison with each other, keiretsu companies have been able to wield a great deal of power. 
Many have monthly meetings in which they exchange information and ideas. Table 12.2 
provides a brief overview of two of the country’s major keiretsu members. Looking closely

at the table, we see that it illustrates how valuable cooperation among the members can 
be. The idea has not been lost on US firms, among others, which are now beginning to put 
together their own “mini-keiretsus.” Eastman Kodak acquired a number of distributors in 
Japan and has taken small stakes in some 50 suppliers and customers, and IBM is invest-
ing venture capital in a host of small European computer-related firms. Motorola has not 
taken equity positions, but it uses a keiretsu approach by developing extremely close ties 
with suppliers.

In what way could best practices help GE develop more effective international 
strategies? Explain.
Best practices could help GE develop more effective international strategies by encour-
aging it to identify those MNEs that are most successful and then discover how they 
accomplish that feat. Do these firms manage to develop more new products than do 
their competitors? Or are they best at getting their new goods into the marketplace 
quickly? Do they produce the highest-quality goods? Or are they lowest-cost producers? 
What accounts for their ability to achieve such an excellent performance? By asking and 
answering these questions, GE can gain insights into how it needs to change its own  
production processes in order to emulate those MNEs successfully.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 1   Many of today’s goods and services will be replaced in the future with faster, more efficient, 
and cheaper substitutes. For this reason, MNEs need to continually research, develop, 
and bring new offerings to the marketplace. One way this is being done is through the use 
of time-to-market accelerators. A good example is concurrent engineering.  
 2   The generation of goods and services entails a number of specific functions. One is obtain-
ing materials or supplies. Many MNEs have found that global sourcing is the best strategy 
because it helps keep down costs while providing a number of other benefits, including 
ensuring an ongoing source of supply and helping the company penetrate overseas markets.  
 3  In the production of goods and services, MNEs focus on a number of key factors, 
including cost, quality, and well-designed production systems. While these three factors 
are often interrelated, each merits specific attention. Multinationals have also developed 
very effective inventory control systems that help minimize carrying costs and increase 
productivity. Attention is also focused on gaining the proper balance between produc-
tion and service domination.  Figure   12.3    illustrates this point.  
 4   International logistics is the designing and managing of a system to control the flow 
of materials and products throughout the firm. In addition to inventory control, this 
involves transportation, packaging, and storing.  
 5   MNEs are currently focusing on a number of areas in improving their production strat-
egies. Three approaches that have been receiving particular attention include (a) technology 
and design, (b) continuous improvement of operations, and (c) the use of strategic alliances 
and acquisitions. These approaches are helping multinationals meet new product and ser-
vice challenges while keeping costs down and quality up.

strategy?   
 9  How does kaizen help bring about increased quality? Is this approach limited to 
Japanese firms or are other MNEs using it as well?

production system? Identify and describe three.   
 11  How does JIT help an MNE control its inventory? Give two examples.   
 12  How is employee training an important factor in implementing JIT and DFT 
production processes?   
 13  Why would an MNE want to determine the degree to which its primary business 
was product dominated and service dominated? Explain.   
 14  Why are MNEs concerned with international logistics? How does this help the 
companies increase their competitiveness?   
 15  In recent years MNEs have been focusing on a number of areas in improving their 
production strategies. What are two of these? Identify and describe each.    
 Flextronics 
 You wouldn’t think that company rivals such as Sony and 
Philips, or Ericsson, Alcatel, and Motorola, would choose to 
share the same factories to build competing products, but 
that is just what has been happening since the emergence 
of electronic manufacturing service providers (EMSPs). 
Contract manufacturing has become a sweeping trend in 
electronics manufacturing. Companies unknown to the 
public, such as Flextronics, Sanmina-SCI, Celestica, and 
Jabil, among others, now make such well-known products 
as IBM PCs, the Microsoft Xbox video console, Web TV set-
top boxes for Philips and Sony, and portable phones for 
Ericsson, Alcatel, and Motorola. In 2006, EMSP industry 
revenues were estimated at over $200 billion. In 2007 two 
of the largest EMSP companies, Flextronics and Solectron, 
combined when Flextronics, with revenues of $18.854 bil-
lion, acquired Solectron, with revenues of $10.561 billion. 
 Flextronics, the largest EMSP, is one of the  Fortune 
Global 500 companies, but most end-customers who use its 
 REAL CASE 
products have never heard of it. Incorporated in Singapore 
in 1990, Flextronics is a provider of vertically integrated 
advanced design and electronics manufacturing services 
(EMS) to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). It

provides these services to various markets, which include 
infrastructure, mobile communication devices, computing, 
consumer digital devices, industrial, semiconductor capital 
equipment, clean technology, aerospace and defense, and 
white goods, automotive and marine, and medical devices. 
As of March 31, 2010, Flextronics total manufacturing capac-
ity was approximately 26.6 million square feet. The company 
helps customers design, build, ship, and service electron-
ics products through a network of facilities in 30 countries 
across four continents. Though officially headquartered in 
Singapore, the company has strong ties to the US market 
and most of its customers are US companies. Flextronics are 
listed on NASDAQ (the United States) and the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange (Germany). 
 Over the years Flextronics has expanded by purchasing 
smaller EMSP contractors and factories from its customers. In 
2001, Flextronics purchased half of Xerox’s office equipment-
making operations for $220 million. The deal came with a 
five-year outsourcing contract for Flextronics to manufac-
ture Xerox products. Currently its 10 largest customers, 
including Sony-Ericsson, Motorola, and Hewlett-Packard, 
account for about 64 percent of net sales from continuing 
operations. 
 In 2010, Flextronics total revenue was US $24,110.7 mil-
lion. It generated 48 percent of its sales from Asia, 31 percent 
from the Americas and 20 percent from Europe. According 
to Rugman (2005), Flextronics is among nine “global” MNEs 
which derived 20 percent sales or more from each of the 
triad regions of North America, Europe and Asia. 
 Because of lower transportation costs as a percentage of 
total value, electronics can be transported by air, whereas 
cars are always transported by sea. This is one main rea-
son why contract manufacturing has been so successful 
in the electronics industry, where parts might travel the 
world over before the product is finished.  
 Prior to the merger with Solectron, Flextronics had 
six industrial parks in low-cost regions near each large 
triad market. In Asia, two industrial parks in China, one in 
Malaysia and one in India and a network of regional manu-
facturing facilities supply printers, cell phones, telephone 
switching boards, and PDAs, among other products. In 
the Americas, products from its two industrial parks (one 
in Mexico, one in Brazil) and its network of manufactur-
ing facilities include automotive, telecommunications, 
networking equipment, and hardware products, among 
others. In Eastern Europe, Poland and Hungary host two 
industrial parks and one in Ukraine that are also sup-
ported by nearby manufacturing facilities and that pro-
duce telecommunications infrastructure, electronics for 
auto-motives, printers, and disposable cameras, among 
others. 
 The choice of location for production facilities is deter-
mined by the quality of the labor force, the cost of producing 
in the country, and the proximity to a triad market. Mexico, 
for example, is the low-cost region in the North American 
market. Brazil has the best industrial capabilities among 
countries in South America and strong ties to large inter-
national firms from Europe and North America. China 
has abundant labor, high expected economic growth, 
and proximity to the large Japanese market where inter-
national firms like Canon, NEC, and Sony are headquartered. 
Eastern Europe is the low-cost production area for West 
European markets. It is no surprise that the Flextronics 
industrial park in Poland is located near a university from 
which it can acquire skilled labor. 
 EMSPs do much more than provide cost-effective manu-
facturing. They help in the design of products to make them 
easier to manufacture; they also provide logistics services, 
such as material procurement, inventory management, 
vendor management, packaging and distribution, and auto-
mation of key components of the supply chain through 
advanced IT. In addition, they offer after-market services 
such as repair and warranty services. 
 Today’s electronic manufacturers have come a long way 
from the cheap labor-based contractors that used to domi-
nate the industry. Robotic automation is now a significant 
part of the production process and is handled mostly by 
specialists. It is their manufacturing expertise that makes 
for lower costs, but EMSPs provide many more advantages 
to OEMs. They decrease the risk of manufacturing because 
OEMs no longer need to make large investments in a new 
factory to create a new product that might or might not 
be successful. EMSPs can also purchase inputs at lower 
prices because they are making cell phones not only for 
Alcatel, but also for Motorola and Ericsson, increasing 
their purchasing power. 
 Contract manufacturing accounts for less than one-
fourth of electronic manufacturing; however, there are 
reasons to believe that EMSP companies will dominate the 
industry in the future. This process will redefine the role 
of OEMs in the electronics industry to one of design and 
marketing.

CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION STRATEGY
 REAL CASE 
 Nike 
 One of the rules of international production strategy is: 
manufacture the highest-quality product and the world is 
likely to beat a path to your door. A number of firms help 
illustrate this rule. One is Nike, the sports shoe producer. 
Making a wide variety of high-quality shoes, Nike cata-
logues more than 800 models for use in approximately 25 
sports. In 1999 it had 35 percent of the world’s market for 
training shoes (and 45 percent in the United States). In 
2010 its sales were $19,014 million. In an effort to keep 
ahead of the competition, Nike updates each shoe at least 
every six months. Most of these ideas are generated by 
Nike’s R&D center in Beaverton, near Portland, Oregon, 
where physiologists and mechanical engineers study the 
stresses on an athlete’s feet and collaborate with stylists 
on new shoe ideas. 
 The aim of the takeover of Umbro on March 3, 2008 was 
to extend these scale advantages. 
 Although Nike sells its products in over 140 countries and 
produces in more than 33 countries, it is really a triad MNE. 
In 2010, over 89 percent of its sales are in the triad markets 
of the United States, Europe, and Asia and 11 percent from 
emerging markets. Nike is still strong in its home market. 
In 2010 and 2009, sales in the United States including US 
sales of other businesses accounted for approximately 
42 percent of total revenues, compared to 43 percent in 
2008. For the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, other businesses 
primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE 
Golf, and Umbro. In 2008, the other businesses primarily 
consisted of Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter (whose primary 
business was the Starter brand business which was sold 
on December 17, 2007), Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which 
was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf, and Umbro. In 2010 
and 2009, non-US sales (including non-US sales of other 
businesses) accounted for 58 and 57 percent of total sales, 
respectively. 
 Nike’s high-quality production is matched by superb 
marketing skills. The world might be beating a path to 
Nike’s door, but the company makes sure the world 
knows where it is. It spends 11 percent of its revenue 
on marketing, and its “swoosh” brand is recognized the 
world over. The company continues to use sports stars to 
endorse its products. Besides American stars like Tiger 
Woods and Andre Agassi, it has used European soccer 
players and cricket players in India, and has gone to China 
for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. The idea is: if you 
can make the “cool” guys wear your products, the rest 
will follow. 
 Perhaps the only thing Nike does not like to be remem-
bered for is the bad publicity around its labor practices 
in Asia. Nike has outsourced all of its production to low-
wage areas. In 2010, virtually all of Nike footwear is pro-
duced by contract factories in Vietnam, China, Indonesia, 
Thailand, and India which accounted approximately 37 
percent, 34 percent, 23 percent, 2 percent, and 1 percent 
of total NIKE brand footwear, respectively. Nike also had 
manufacturing agreements with independent factories in 
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and India to manufacture foot-
wear for sales within those countries. In addition, all its 
apparel is produced in 33 host countries by independent 
contract manufacturers. Most of the apparel production 
occurred in China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, 
Sri Lanka, Turkey, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mexico, and 
Taiwan. And NGOs have criticized the poor working 
conditions in some of its Asian factories, from Pakistani 
children stitching Nike’s soccer balls to Vietnamese 
working in unsafe conditions. NGOs in the Western world 
started campaigns to boycott Nike, and demonstrators 
protested in front of Nike’s stores. Allegations of long 
working hours, bad ventilation, and physical abuse of a 
mostly young female workforce have tarnished Nike’s 
reputation. 
 Nike’s industry dominance was a main reason for its 
being severely targeted. Many of its competitors were 
found to have the same labor practices, but were not sub-
jected to the same level of criticism. More recently Nike 
has acknowledged its corporate responsibility to improve 
working conditions in its own factories and help influence 
its suppliers.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Every multinational has a marketing strategy designed to help 
identify opportunities and take advantage of them. This plan of action 
typically involves consideration of four primary areas: the product or 
service to be sold, the way in which the output will be promoted, the 
pricing of the good or service, and the distribution strategy to be used 
in getting the output to the customer. The primary purpose of this 
chapter is to examine the fundamentals of international marketing 
strategy. We will look at five major topics: market assessment, 
product strategy, promotion strategy, price strategy, and place 
strategy. We will consider such critical marketing areas as product 
screening, modification of goods and services in order to adapt 
to local needs, modified product life cycles, advertising, personal 
selling, and ways in which MNEs tailor-make their distribution 
systems. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  the process used to conduct an international market 
assessment of goods and services.  
 2  Study  the criteria that affect an MNE’s decision to alter a good or 
service in order to adapt it to local market tastes.  
 3  Describe  some of the ways in which MNEs use advertising 
and personal selling techniques to promote their products in 
worldwide markets.  
 4  Review  some of the major factors that influence international 
pricing and distribution strategies.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 During the 1960s, Volkswagen AG, the “people’s car” in 
German and “VW” to everyone else, held more market 
share in the United States than all other auto imports com-
bined. In the 1970s, despite growing foreign competition, 
VW sales reached 300,000 units annually. This included the 
early version of the famous VW Golf, branded the Rabbit 
in the US market (and the Caribe in Latin America), under 
the audacious advertising slogan: “Why Detroit’s engineers 
are secretly praising Volkswagen’s Rabbit.” However, the 
1980s and early 1990s were not good for the company: 
annual sales in the US market were down to 150,000 units. 
The Rabbit in particular developed a bad reputation for 
its build quality, in contrast to the marketing PR. In less 
than 10 years, market share had dropped from 3 percent 
to 0.5 percent, and VW had become a minor competitor in 
the North American part of the triad. Part of the problem 
had been that VW’s American cars were competing head 
on with US brands that produced the traditional mid-sized 
car. VW could produce great cars in this range, but could 
not achieve the cost advantage of Japanese competitors. 
 In the early 2000s, however, VW made a great comeback 
in the United States, particularly on the back of sales of the 
New Beetle, which was introduced in March 1998. The car 
is distinct not only because it appeals to the nostalgia of the 
Old Beetle, but also because of its slick European design. 
The New Beetle was the third-largest VW seller, after the 
Jetta and the Passat. In addition to brisk first-year sales, 
the Beetle was selected as the 1999 North American Car 
of the Year by an independent jury of 48 journalists who 
cover the auto industry for daily newspapers, magazines, 
television, radio, and the Internet. In 2002, VW delivered 
over 420,000 vehicles to the US market and accounted for 
approximately 10.1 percent of the passenger car import 
market. Including imports and domestic production, VW 
held about 6.6 percent of the US passenger car market. 
But a period of success was brought to an end by the rising 
costs of producing cars in Europe relative to the declining 
US dollar. By 2005 VW was losing money on each car it 
exported to the United States, leaving it with $1.1 billion 
of losses from its US operations. Its North American sales 
stood at 224,195, rising to 235,140 in 2006, but with continued 
weak profitability. This is despite a return to marketing the 
VW Golf under the Rabbit name once again. 
 In its home region of Europe, where VW is the market 
leader, nearly 20 percent of all new cars sold are from 
the Volkswagen Group. In 2009, during the economic 
downturn, Volkswagen’s revenue was €105.187 billion 
and it delivered a total of over 6.3 million vehicles to 
customers worldwide, a slight increase in sales by 0.6 per-
cent year-on-year compared to the reporting period 2008. 
European region accounts for 71.49 percent of VW’s total 
revenue, of which Germany alone accounts for 28.4 per-
cent and the rest of Europe 43.1 percent. North America 
as a whole accounts for only 10.83 percent, and the rest 
of world (Asia–Pacific and South America) accounts for 
17.76 percent. The year 2010 witnessed an impressive 
growth 15.4 percent in the number of vehicle sales of 
7.3 million units. VW achieved revenue of €126.875 billion, 
significantly exceeding the 2009 year figure and represent-
ing an increase of 20.6 percent, greater than that of the 
market as a whole, thanks to its strategies with model range 
updated and rationally expanded. For example, in the year 
2010, the VW passenger car brand updated its outstanding 
range by launching a new generation of numerous models, 
including the Passat and the Touran. In addition, vehicles 
designed for specific markets were presented. Therefore, 
the brand’s operating profit increased significantly. 
 Despite its resurgence in the United States, VW is still 
facing many problems: as at February 16, 2008, 20.26 per-
cent of VW’s shares are still held by the government of 
Lower Saxony, which prevents VW from cutting labor costs 
in Germany. As a result, VW is stuck paying $1,700 more to 
make a car in Germany than if it were manufacturing it in 
Eastern Europe or Portugal, limiting its ability to compete 
on price. This had not been a major problem when VW’s 
reputation for quality allowed it to charge a premium, but 
since Mercedes-Benz and BMW started to compete in VW’s 
market segment, the company’s edge on quality diminished.

CHAPTER 13 MARKETING STRATEGY
 VW’s problems are not new. A decade earlier the com-
pany had to reinvent itself to become competitive without 
reducing its labor costs. At the time, its strategy consisted 
of brand acquisition and manufacturing improvements. 
In about a decade VW purchased the Skoda, SEAT, Audi, 
Bentley, Scania (on February 20, 2009, the VW acquired 
Scania AB), Lamborghini, and Bugatti brands and set out 
to create synergies in their manufacturing processes. In 
the early 1990s, VW was making 30 different models using 
16 floor plants. This was subsequently slimmed down to 
4 floor plants, making 54 models, with significant savings. 
This means that many of its cars, whether sold under the 
Skoda, Audi, or VW brand, share many parts. It is each 
brand’s reputation and design that now carry the car. 
Under the hood, a Skoda is very similar to a VW but the 
company has ensured a different market by letting Czech 
engineers design the Skoda. This brand-based strategy has 
paid off, increasing VW’s market share around the world. 
Yet, as critics point out, the company’s return on capital 
is lower than that of its competitors, and its brands might 
eventually erode each other’s market share. VW continues 
to bargain with its union and with its major shareholder 
to curb labor costs in Germany or to be allowed to close 
plants there. However, the compromises continue to put it 
at a disadvantage with competitors. In addition, consumers 
might not take long to realize that a Skoda, which is pro-
moted as part of the VW family, is cheaper but equivalent 
to a VW. Its upmarket brands, such as the Lamborghini and 
Bentley, might also suffer from a perception that many of 
their parts are comparable to that of VW’s other brands.

What type of distribution system would be most effective for VW in the United States?     
 International marketing   is the process of identifying the goods and services that cus-
tomers outside the home country want and then providing them at the right price and 
location. 1  In the international marketplace, this process is similar to that carried out at 
home, but with some important modiﬁ cations that can adapt marketing efforts to the 
needs of the speciﬁ c country or geographic locale. 2  For example, some MNEs are able to 
use the same strategy abroad as they have at home. This is particularly true in promotions 
where messages can carry a universal theme. Some writing implement ﬁ rms advertise their 
pens and pencils as “the ﬁ nest writing instruments in the world,” a message that transcends 
national boundaries and can be used anywhere. Many fast-food franchises apply the same 
ideas because they have found that people everywhere have the same basic reasons for com-
ing there to eat. In most cases, however, a company must tailor-make its strategy so that it 
appeals directly to the local customer.  
 These changes fall into five major areas: market assessment, product decisions, pro-
motion strategies, pricing decisions, and place or distribution strategies. The latter four 
areas—product, promotion, price, and place—are often referred to as the four Ps of 
marketing, 3 and they constitute the heart of international marketing efforts.

that customers outside the

right price and place    

402
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 International marketing strategy starts with  international market assessment , an evalu-
ation of the goods and services that the MNE can sell in the global marketplace. This 
assessment typically involves a series of analyses aimed at pinpointing speciﬁ c offerings and 
geographic targets. The ﬁ rst step is called the initial screening.  
  Initial screening: basic need and potential 
 Initial screening   is the process of determining the basic need and potential of the MNE’s 
goods and services in foreign markets. This screening answers the question: who might be 
interested in buying our output? International auto manufacturers list the EU countries, 
North America, and Japan as potential buyers. Boeing targets the countries that will be 
rebuilding their air ﬂ eets in the next few decades. Kellogg’s, General Mills, and Nestlé are 
interested in the United States and the European Union as well as any developing nations 
that offer potential new markets. 
 One way to carry out initial screening is by examining the current import policies of 
other countries and identifying the goods and services being purchased from abroad. A 
second way is by determining local production. A third is to examine the demographic 
changes taking place in the country that will create new, emerging markets. These cursory 
efforts help an MNE to target potential markets. Following the initial screening, the com-
pany begins to narrow its selection.    
  Second screening: financial and economic conditions 
 Secondary screening is used to reduce the list of market prospects by eliminating those 
that fail to meet ﬁ nancial and economic considerations. Financial considerations include 
in ﬂ ation rates, interest rates, expected returns on investment, the buying habits of customers, 
and the availability of credit. These factors are important in determining whether markets 
that passed the initial, general screening are also ﬁ nancially feasible. 
 Economic considerations relate to a variety of market demand influences, including 
market indicators.   Market indicators   are used for measuring the relative market strengths 
of various geographic areas, and focus on three important areas: market size, market inten-
sity, and market growth.   Market size   is the relative size of each market as a percentage of 
the total world market. For example, industrialized countries account for a sizable part of 
the market for cellular telephones, and a few nations such as the United States and Japan 
account for the largest percentage of this total. Nevertheless, non-industrialized countries 
with large populations also have a significant market size. In fact, China, the world’s largest 
country in terms of population, is also the world’s largest mobile phone market in terms of 
subscribers. 4  Market intensity   is the “richness” of the market, or the degree of purchasing 
power in one country compared to others. For example, the United States and Canada are 
extremely rich markets for automobiles, telephones, and computers, so MNEs selling these 
products tend to highlight these two countries.   Market growth   is the annual increase in 
sales. For example, the market for cell phones and laptop computers in the United States 
will continue to grow in the years ahead, whereas the market for autos will grow much more 
slowly. However, given the large purchasing power in the US economy, MNEs selling these 
products will continue to target the United States. In recent years, other economies, such as 
South Korea, have become increasingly rich in terms of purchasing power, so they too are 
now target markets for high-tech products. Infrastructure and economic development can 
also influence market growth. For example, consumers in developing countries who have 
not yet been able to acquire a fixed line might choose instead to purchase a portable phone.

CHAPTER 13 MARKETING STRATEGY
 Quite often these data are analyzed through the use of quantitative techniques. Sometimes 
these approaches are fairly simple.   Trend analysis  , for example, is the estimation of future 
demand either by extrapolating the growth over the last three to five years and assuming 
that this trend will continue or by using some form of average growth rate over the recent 
past. A similar approach is   estimation by analogy  , through which forecasters predict 
market demand or growth based on information generated in other countries. For example, 
if the number of refrigerators sold in the United States is 2.5 times the number of new 
housing starts, a US MNE that is planning to manufacture these products in the European 
Union will estimate demand based on the same formula. A more sophisticated approach is 
the use of   regression analysis  , a mathematical approach to forecasting that attempts to 
test the explanatory power of a set of independent variables. In the case of selling refrigerators 
in the European Union, for example, these would include economic growth, per capita 
income, and the number of births, in addition to other variables such as new housing starts. 
Another sophisticated approach is   cluster analysis  , a marketing approach that involves 
grouping data on the basis of market area, customer, and so on, based on similar variables, 
so that a marketing strategy can be formulated for each group. For example, US MNEs 
providing services in such areas as insurance, legal, financial, and management consulting 
know that their approaches must often vary from country to country.  
  Third screening: political and legal forces 
 The third level of screening involves taking a look at political and legal forces. A primary 
consideration is entry barriers in the form of import restrictions or limits on local owner-
ship of business operations. Analysis of these barriers often results in identifying loopholes 
around the various restrictions or data that indicate barriers are far less extensive than 
initially believed. 5  For example, some MNEs have been able to sidestep legal restrictions 
by forming joint ventures with local ﬁ rms. Production restrictions or limitations on proﬁ t 
remittance that restrict operating ﬂ exibility must also be considered. Government stabil-
ity is an important factor in starting a successful operation; however, it is often difﬁ cult 
to predict. Despite the eagerness of investors to ﬂ ock to the Russian market in the early 
1990s, auto makers were hesitant to invest in Russia because of its uncertain political and 
economic environment. It was only in 1998 that Fiat made a commitment to the Russian 
market. 6  Another consideration is the protection offered for patents, trademarks, and copy-
rights. In some countries, such as China and Taiwan, pirating has been fairly common, 
resulting in markets being ﬂ ooded with counterfeit or look-alike products. 
  Fourth screening: socio-cultural forces 
 The fourth level of screening typically involves the consideration of socio-cultural forces 
such as language, work habits, customs, religion, and values. As noted earlier, culture greatly 
affects the way people live, and MNEs need to examine how well their operations will ﬁ t 
into each particular culture. For example, although Japanese auto manufacturers have set 
up assembly plants in the United States, those operations are not identical to the ones in 
Japan because of the work habits and customs of Americans. In the United States, the work 
pace is less frantic and most people are unwilling to work the typical 5½-day week which is 
so common in Japan. Moreover, US managers are accustomed to going home to their fami-
lies after work, whereas Japanese managers often go out for dinner and drinks and discuss 
business until late in the evening. MNEs will examine these socio-cultural differences in 
determining where to locate operations. 
 Another study by an advertising firm shows that Muslims in the United States are 
among the richest and well educated of the US population. Their buying patterns are

  Fifth screening: competitive environment 
 The ﬁ fth level of screening is typically focused on competitive forces. If three or four 
locations are equally attractive, an MNE will often make a ﬁ nal choice based on the 
degree of competition that exists in each locale. In some cases companies do not want 
to enter markets where there is strong competition. However, they will often decide to 
enter a competitive market because they believe the potential beneﬁ ts far outweigh the 
drawbacks. By going head-to-head with the competition, the company can force itself 
to become more efﬁ cient and effective and thus improve its own competitiveness. The 
MNE can take market share away from competitors and put them on the defensive, forc-
ing them to commit more resources to defending the market under attack and thereby 
reducing their ability to retaliate effectively. Of course, these conditions do not always 
hold true, but they help illustrate why MNEs consider entering markets that are domi-
nated by competitors.  
 Final selection 
 Before making a ﬁ nal selection, MNEs usually enhance their information by visiting the 
sites and talking to trade representatives or local ofﬁ cials. Such ﬁ eld trips are very common 
and can do a great deal to supplement currently available information. Sometimes these 
trips take the form of a trade mission: a visit sponsored by commercial ofﬁ cers in a country’s 
local embassy and designed to bring together executives from MNEs that are interested in 
examining the beneﬁ ts of doing business in the particular country. 
 Based on the outcome of the screenings and the supplemental data, the MNE chooses 
which goods and services to offer overseas. The marketing strategy employed in this process 
revolves around what are commonly called the four Ps of marketing: product, promotion, 
price, and place.

How would VW use market assessment to evaluate sales potential for its cars 
in the United States? 
 There are several steps VW could take. One is to look at the number of cars being 
imported into the country, as well as the number being built locally; this would provide 
important information regarding current product supply. Another would be to find out the 
number of auto registrations and how fast it is growing annually; this would be useful in 
predicting new sales potential. A third would be to examine the trend of new car sales 
over the last couple of years and forecast overall industry sales for the next two to three 
years. A fourth would be to compare the strengths offered by VW cars to those offered 
by the competition and evaluate how the company can position its offering for maximum 
market penetration.

CHAPTER 13 MARKETING STRATEGY
 Product strategies vary depending on the speciﬁ cs of the product itself and the characteris-
tics of the target market segment. Some products can be manufactured and sold successfully 
both in the United States and abroad by using the same strategies. Other products must be 
modiﬁ ed or adapted and sold according to a specially designed strategy.  Figure   13.1    shows 
a range of possibilities. Products and services located on the left side of the continuum 
require little modiﬁ cation; those on the right must be modiﬁ ed to ﬁ t the market. To some 
degree this range of options parallels the more general international business manager’s 
challenge to strike an appropriate balance between being “global or local”, to standardize or 
customize, to integrate across all dimensions of the business or respond to local differences. 
  Little or no modification 
 Industrial goods and technical services are good examples of products that need little or no 
modiﬁ cation. A bulldozer, a laptop, and a photocopying machine serve the same purposes 
and are used the same way in the United States as they are in France or in China.       8 Alterations 
would be minor and would include such things as adapting the machine to the appropriate 
electric voltage or changing the language used for its instructions and labels. The same is 
true for many types of services. For example, international engineering and construction 
ﬁ rms ﬁ nd that their product strategies are similar worldwide. People interested in hav-
ing a dam or power plant constructed use the same basic concepts and have similar needs 
throughout the world. In fact, experience is the greatest selling point in convincing clients 
to hire an MNE in engineering or construction. Foreign design and construction ﬁ rms that 
proved themselves in the Burj Al Arab Hotel project in Dubai, for example, were invited to 
participate in the unprecedented Palm Jumeirah artiﬁ cial island project. 
 Companies with a strong international brand image have also been able to succeed 
without a differentiation strategy. For example, the world-famous Scotch Chivas Regal is 
sold in many countries and is identical in each one. Schweppes (tonic water) and Perrier 
are internationally known and are also identical worldwide.  
  Moderate to high modification 
 A number of factors can compel an MNE to use moderate to high product modiﬁ cation. 
These include economics, culture, local laws, and product life cycle. 
 PRODUCT STRATEGIES 
 Figure 13.1  Selected examples of product modification in the international arena 

406
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Economics 
 There are many examples of how economic considerations affect the decision to modify a 
product. For example, chewing gum packages often contain 10 to 20 sticks in the United 
States. But in many other countries, weak customer purchasing power necessitates packaging 
the gum with only ﬁ ve sticks. Countries vary in terms of the use of cars versus public trans-
port and in terms of average house sizes (therefore storage space), so buying patterns also vary 
accordingly and ﬁ rms must customize product size and packaging to suit local preferences. 
 Economics is also important when the cost of a product is either too high or too low to 
make it attractive in another country. For example, cash registers are electronic in economi-
cally advanced countries; virtually no one uses hand-cranked machines. However, in many 
other countries they are too expensive and sophisticated for most retail stores and small 
establishments, so MNEs like National Cash Register continue to manufacture the hand-
cranked versions. On the other hand, inexpensive calculators are widely used throughout 
the world, and many stores use handheld calculators to total customer purchases (although 
in some places calculations may be cross-checked for accuracy with an abacus). 
 Similarly, in economically advanced countries products are likely to have frills or extras, 
whereas only the basic model is offered in poorer countries. For example, bicycles in the 
United States are used for exercise and recreation and have a number of special features 
that make bicycle riding particularly enjoyable, whereas in many other countries they are 
a primary source of transportation. US bikes are built for comfort and ease of handling; 
elsewhere they are built for economy and ease of maintenance. As a result, manufacturers 
need to modify the product to fit customer needs.  
 Culture 
 A product must sometimes be adapted to different ways of doing things. Consider washing 
machines. The French prefer washers that load from the top, the British like front-loading 
units, the Germans prefer high-speed machines that take out most of the moisture in the 
spin-dry process, and the Italians like slower spin speeds because they prefer to hang-dry 
laundry in the sun. So manufacturers which sell washing machines in the European Union 
must produce a variety of different units. 
 Food is an item that often must be modified or sold differently. In fast-food franchises 
like McDonald’s, portions of the menu are similar throughout the world while other items 
are designed to cater specifically to local tastes. Coffee in South American units tends to 
be a much stronger blend than that sold in North America. In certain parts of Europe 
and Asia, the food is more highly seasoned in keeping with local tastes. For products that 
are not modified, the marketing focus is different because of the way the item is used. 
Schweppes, for example, is typically served as a mixer in the United States and UK, where 
drinks like gin and tonic are popular. In France, however, it is drunk without alcohol. 
Clearly, marketing approaches differ in these two situations. The marketing message 
is also important when selling hard liquors. The products remain the same, but many 
places have social customs that frown on excessive consumption. In these cases, MNEs 
such as Seagram of Canada have tailored their advertising messages along the lines of 
moderate drinking and the use of mixers to reduce the alcoholic content per serving. 
 Culture also influences purchasing decisions on the basis of style or aesthetics. 
Cosmetics and other beauty aids are good examples. Perfumes that sell well in Europe 
often have difficulty gaining market share in the United States because they do not appeal 
to American women. Similarly, many products that sell well in the United States, such 
as shampoos and deodorants, have limited market appeal elsewhere. People may not use 
these products, or they may find it hard to differentiate a product from local offerings. For 
example, Gillette has found it is difficult to develop a distinctive edge in selling toiletries 
because many people feel these products are all basically the same. 

407
CHAPTER 13 MARKETING STRATEGY
 Convenience and comfort are other culturally driven factors that help explain the need for 
product modification. Early Japanese autos in the United States were designed to attack other 
foreign imports, specifically the VW Beetle. Researchers found that the two biggest complaints 
with the Beetle were the small amount of room in the back seat and the heater, which took too 
long to warm up the car. Aware that Americans wanted an economical car with these ad di tional 
features, Japanese imports offered greater leg room for back seat passengers and a heater that 
was superior to the VW offering. Within a few years these imports had began to erode VW’s 
market share. Foreign manufacturers also identified a group that wanted several convenience 
and comfort features. The result has been the emergence of luxury Japanese and German cars 
that now compete extremely well with US models in the upper end of the market. 
 Other culturally based reasons for product modifications include color and language. 
In the United States, the color black is worn for mourning, whereas in other countries 
white is for mourning and thus is not used for consumer goods. Similarly, most American 
shampoos are light colored, whereas in some Oriental countries consumers prefer dark-
colored shampoo. Language can be an important point of modification because a product 
may need to carry instructions about contents or use. In locations where two or more 
languages are spoken, such as Canada and Switzerland, this information is provided in all 
appropriate languages. Language is also important in conveying the right image for the 
product. Quite often it is difficult to replicate the message because the saying or slogan has 
no meaning in another language.  
 Local laws 
 Local laws can require product modiﬁ cation in order to meet environmental and safety 
requirements. For example, US emission-control laws have required Japanese and European 
car importers to make signiﬁ cant model changes before their autos can be sold in the United 
States. Food and pharmaceutical regulations require packaging and labeling that are often 
quite different from those in the home country. In Saudi Arabia, the label of any product con-
taining animal fat or meat must clearly state the kind of animal used and the fact that no swine 
products are included. Brand name protection can also require product modiﬁ cation. Ford 
found that in Mexico it had to rename its Ford Falcon because this brand name was registered 
to another ﬁ rm. The same thing happened to Ford in the case of the Mustang in Germany.  
 Product life cycle 
 Another reason for modifying a product is to cope with its limited product life cycle (PLC). 
Although Ford was extremely proﬁ table in Europe during the 1980s, those earnings had 
disappeared by the early 1990s because Ford did not develop new, competitive products.       9 
Contrast this to Coca-Cola of Japan, which introduces an average of one new soft drink per 
month and has the competition scurrying to keep up. Yet Kola Real has been particularly 
effective in offsetting the technology and marketing of Coca-Cola to bring its own products 
to market in Mexico. The case  International Business Strategy in Action: Kola Real Group 
describes the company’s approach. 
 One of the most effective strategies has been to shorten the PLC by offering new goods 
and services before the demand for the old ones has dropped significantly.  Figure   13.2    
provides a graphic illustration. Note that there are two types of PLCs: (1) the standard 
PLC, which covers an extended time continuum, often four to five years, and (2) a short 
life cycle that lasts a much shorter time. Many companies are discovering that by shorten-
ing the PLC and offering new product adaptations they are able to capture and retain a 
large market share. This is typically done by offering a new product, then modifying it, and 
bringing out a new version before the competition can effectively combat the first offering.

 Kola Real Group 
 You may have heard of the cola wars in the 1980s and 
early 1990s, but you probably have not heard of the cur-
rent Mexico cola war. Mexico is the world’s second-largest 
market for non-alcoholic drinks and an important market 
for the world’s largest cola brands. Coca-Cola derives 
11 per cent of its world sales from this market, and in 
2000 it held about 70 percent of the market for carbon-
ated drinks. Pepsi had 15 percent of the market, with the 
remaining 15 percent dispersed among smaller competi-
tors. Mexico was, by all accounts, a saturated market. But 
since 2002, when upstart Kola Real entered the market, 
the competitive environment has gotten tougher for the 
big players. Today, Coca-Cola is constantly monitoring the 
marketing schemes of Kola Real to prevent further erosion 
of its market share. 
 Kola Real was founded in 1988 by the Añaños family in 
the capital city of the province of Ayacucho, Peru. At the 
time, the founders were rural immigrants running from 
the violence brought about by the emergence of the Shining 
Path guerrillas in the countryside. Once in the city, they 
realized that the demand for carbonated drinks was not 
being met by either Coca-Cola or Pepsi, which routinely 
discontinued deliveries because their trucks were often 
robbed by the guerrillas or common criminals. So Jorge 
Añaños, an agricultural engineer, developed a formula 
for a new drink. The family borrowed $30,000 and started 
producing it. In the early 1990s the rest of the family joined 
the firm to market the drink and opened a series of plants 
in the provinces. It was only in 1997 that the firm entered 
Lima, the largest market in Peru. Today, the firm has a 
20 percent market share in its domestic market. 
 Kola Real’s first international excursion was to Venezuela 
in 1999. At the time, plastic containers accounted for only 
3 percent of the carbonated market. Kola Real saw an 
opportunity in this because the cost of plastic bottles is 
lower than for glass. More recently the firm controlled 
17 percent of the Venezuelan market. In 2001, it entered the 
Ecuador market because of its proximity to the northern 
part of Peru; it managed to hold 12 percent of that market. 
 Kola Real was lured to the Mexican market because of 
its size and its high per capita consumption of carbonated 
beverages. It established its first plant in 2002, choosing 
Puebla because it is well linked to the rest of the country, 
the cost of land is reasonable, there is an excellent source 
of water, and it is not too far from Mexico City. Only two 
years later, the firm had captured 4 percent of the mar-
ket. A new plant opened in the northern part of Mexico in 
2005 and is expected to contribute to the company’s goal 
of reaching a 10 percent market share by 2009. Cielo, its 
bottled water, is presently the market leader. 
 A number of factors have contributed to Kola Real’s 
success. One is that it has chosen the poorest part of the 
population as its market segment. When the firm started 
operations in Ayacucho, the city was filled with poor rural 
immigrants. Both the guerrillas and the Peruvian military 
had all but destroyed the province’s economy. And this 
was the province that had given birth to the insurgents. 
There was a heightened displeasure with social injustice. 
Kola Real responded by providing a much cheaper product 
under the banner “The drink at the just price.” By doing 
this, it not only appealed to its customers but assured them 
that its slogan did not use the words  cheap  or  inexpensive , 
which would have undermined the quality of the product. 
This slogan and the accompanying low price were then 
exported across the nation and into the three other Latin 
American markets, where they were welcomed by the 
same lower-income population segments. 
 Another reason is that the firm’s expenses are very aus-
tere, allowing it to offer the lowest prices in the market and 
still enjoy a substantial profit. Whenever possible, the firm 
has maintained its own distribution system. Administrative 
costs are kept to a minimum. Although its plants use 
top-of-the-line technology for production, the adminis-
trative offices are very modestly furnished. Finally, the firm 
relies on word of mouth to market its products. 
 Analysts argue that large competitors are often unable 
or unwilling to respond to the poorest segments of society 
in Latin America, relying instead on large-scale distribu-
tion to establishments servicing the middle and upper 
classes. Before Kola Real entered the Mexican market, 
the same bottle of Coca-Cola that cost $1.00 in the United 
States cost $1.40 in Mexico—despite the lower per capita 
income. Although Kola Real may be found at Carrefour 
stores across Mexico, the firm relies heavily on its sales 
force to push the product in small establishments, which 
account for 80 percent of the Mexican market and serve the 
chosen market segment. Kola Real argues that by provid-
ing more personalized and fitted service to these points of 
sale it has increased the size of the market, not stolen a big 
chunk of the large players’ market. 
 Coca-Cola is not sitting idly by. When Kola Real intro-
duced the 2.6 liter “Big Cola” at a price of $0.75 to mar-
ket to poor large families, Coca-Cola followed suit and 
introduced its own 2.5 liter bottle. However, it sells it for 
almost twice as much at $1.30. To counter Kola Real grow-
ing expansion, Coca-Cola began to offer discounts and

than their predecessors. As processors get faster, they consume more energy and generate 
more heat, so for the meantime, until these issues are resolved, Intel cannot produce faster 
processors. As a result, more task-specific chips have been introduced.       10  The Centrino 
processor now caters to wireless users and the Desktrino caters to desktop users. The video 
game platform market provides another example of strategic continuous innovation. 
Nintendo and Sony constantly introduce new products and games to capture the market, 
always leaving the competition scurrying to keep up. 11 As long as a firm can continue such 
an adaptation strategy, it can outmode the old product (and those of competitors as well) 
and maintain market position. At some point the competition may gain the advantage 
by offering a product that revolutionizes the field, but as long as a product improvement 
strategy remains viable, the firm will continue to be the product leader. This strategy is 
being implemented by MNEs throughout the world.

the Mexican bureau that regulates competition. Meanwhile, 
Kola Real recently introduced the 3.1 liter Mega Big Cola in 
Mexico. In the future, it is likely to introduce a larger variety 
of carbonated drinks. 
 There have always been no-frills carbonated drinks in 
Latin America. They have been able to succeed despite being 
inefficient because of the large difference between produc-
tion costs and the price charged by the market leaders. 
Kola Real’s international success was possible because it 
manufactured and marketed its products efficiently.

Does VW need to modify its cars for the US market? Why or why not? 
 Based on the case data, it appears that VW needs to make some changes in styling and 
engineering. The company is convinced that Americans will buy cars that offer German 
engineering and quality, but in the past it has made the mistake of producing cars that look 
“too American.” Because of this, many people bought cars from Ford, GM, and Chrysler 
because there were no distinctive qualities that VW could use in attracting these buyers. 
By modifying its cars and giving them European styling and German engineering, VW can 
lead from strength and exploit its market advantage.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Promotion   is the process of stimulating demand for a company’s goods and services.       12 
MNEs promote their goods and services through advertising and personal selling. The spe-
ciﬁ c approach used, however, will be determined by the nature of the product.  
  Nature of the product 
 In promoting a product, a company can use a variety of approaches. The choice is heavily 
inﬂ uenced by whether the ﬁ rm believes the same message can be used worldwide or needs 
to be adapted, and whether the product will remain the same or need to be modiﬁ ed. Here 
are four variations on this theme: 
 ■  Identical product and identical message.  This approach is used when the MNE intends 
to sell the same product worldwide and believes that an identical promotional appeal 
can be used in all markets. A. T. Cross, for example, uses this strategy because writing 
instruments do not need to be adapted to local markets.  
 ■  Identical product but different message.  This strategy is used when the product satisfies 
a different need in various markets. For example, in the United States many car com-
panies tout the luxury and convenience of their products, whereas in other countries 
the same cars are promoted on the basis of their fuel efficiency or ability to meet basic 
transportation needs. 
 ■  Modified product but same message.  This strategy is used when the market requires a dif-
ferent version of the product but the needs of the consumer are the same. For example, 
whether washing machines load from the top or the front, they provide the same function 
and meet the same customer needs. Similarly, in many countries the seasoning of foods 
differs from that of foods sold in the United States. So although the product is changed, 
the promotion message remains the same because the buyer’s needs are the same.  
 ■  Modified product and modified message.  When the product use and buying habits of 
customers are different from those in the MNE’s home market, both the product and 
promotion message will be modified. For example, breakfast cereal companies such 
as Kellogg’s and General Mills are developing new versions of their popular American 
cereals for sale in the European market. Many Europeans do not eat cereal for breakfast, 
however, so the promotion campaign is geared toward changing eating habits rather 
than getting consumers to switch product loyalty.    
 Advertising 
 Advertising   is a non-personal form of promotion in which a ﬁ rm attempts to persuade 
consumers to a particular point of view. In many cases MNEs use the same advertising 
message worldwide; again, because many products ﬁ ll similar worldwide needs, a company 
can use a universal message and reduce advertising costs at the same time. However, there 
are times when the advertising must be adapted to the local market.       13  Two of the most 
common reasons are that (1) the way in which the product is used differs from that in the 
home country, and (2) the advertising message does not make sense if translated directly. 
An example of the latter is the Nike commercials that encourage the viewer to “Just do it,” 
or Budweiser commercials that ask, “Why ask why?” These ads make sense to American viewers, 
but they are too culturally grounded to be used in many other countries, and would leave the 
viewer confused as to what the advertiser was saying. As a result, advertisers are very careful to 
tie their messages to buyer needs and wants. On the other hand, there are many advertisements 
that have been only moderately modiﬁ ed or carried in their entirety because they  do make 
sense in other cultures. For example, Nike’s ads featuring such internationally known sports

stars as Tiger Woods and David Beckham transcend national boundaries, especially after 
the media exposure they have received. The case International Business Strategy in Action: 
IKEA in international markets provides some examples of how this is being done.
International Business Strategy in Action
IKEA in international markets
From its founding as a small, private Swedish furniture 
retailer in 1943, IKEA has grown to become a multinational 
business with 127,000 employees and annual sales of  
a23.1 billion in 2010. As of August 2010, there are IKEA 
stores in more than 38 countries, with 280 stores in 26 
coun­tries belonging to the IKEA Group. 
The parent company of the IKEA Group of com­panies 
INGKA Holding BV (the Netherlands) is owned by the Stichting 
INGKA Foundation in the Netherlands. The Stichting INGKA 
Foundation in the Netherlands was founded in 1982 by the 
IKEA founder, Mr. Ingvar Kamprad to create an ownership 
structure and an organization that stand for independence 
and taking a long term approach. It has two purposes: to 
reinvest in the IKEA group and to fund charity through the 
Stichting Foundation. The company is headquartered in 
Delft, the Netherlands. 
In 2010, for the first time, IKEA published some information 
about its financial data to dismiss the “secretive” image. With 
the published data, it is clear that IKEA is a home region 
based private multinational in terms of sales, purchases and 
employees. For the year 2010, IKEA generated 79 percent of 
its total sales from Europe, 15 percent from North America 
and 6 percent from Asia and Australia. In addition, IKEA pur­
chases 62 percent of goods for sales from Europe, 34 percent 
from Asia and 4 percent from North America. Furthermore, 
IKEA had 103,500 employees in Europe, 15,500 employees in 
North America and 8,000 employees in Asia and Australia.
With its international expansion strategy, today, 
Muscovites and Londoners can buy towels produced in 
Turkey at one of the retailer’s warehouse stores.
This internationalization process is all the more remark­
able in that IKEA has remained true to the basic philos­
ophy of its founder, Ingvar Kamprad, throughout its global 
expansion. Kamprad redesigned the furniture industry by 
introducing knock-down kits that customers could take 
away from the store and assemble themselves, enabling 
the company to stock larger quantities of furniture in its 
warehouses. Costs were lowered because these kits were 
easier to transport, took up less space in IKEA’s large 
warehouse stores, and there was no need for assembly 
or delivery. In turn, customers could have their furniture 
immediately and could transport it in their own cars, sav­
ing on delivery costs. IKEA did a lot more than just provide 
convenient, easy-to-transport products, however. First, 
the products are carefully designed and more stylish than 
bargain do-it-yourself competitors. Second, IKEA changed 
furniture shopping from its traditional frosty “showroom” 
mentality to a more “fun” place with children’s playpens, 
nurseries, and cafés in the stores. Indeed, a trip to an IKEA 
store is entertainment for the entire family. IKEA also built 
on the fast-growing informal suburban culture by providing 
abundant parking.
IKEA’s relaxed, informal, yet efficient image was 
extended to Oslo and Denmark in the 1960s. It entered 
Switzerland in 1973, Munich in 1974. By 1980, IKEA had 
opened an additional 10 stores across Germany and fol­
lowed this with an expansion through Western Europe that 
culminated with its entry into the UK in 1987. In 1990, it 
entered the East European market with a store in Hungary; 
shortly after it entered Poland, the Czech Republic, and 
Slovakia. In 2000, it opened its first 
store in Moscow.
Expansion into other parts of the 
triad has been slower. In Asia and 
Oceania, IKEA opened its first store 
in Australia in 1975 and in Singapore 
in 1978. But its next expansion 
was in 1988, when it entered Hong 
Kong. Taiwan, Malaysia, and main­
land China were added in the 1990s. 
In North America, IKEA opened a 
store in 1976 in Canada and used its 
Canadian operations to expand into

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 As in the United States, MNEs use several media to carry their advertising messages. The 
three most popular are television, radio, and newspapers. Some of the major differences 
between the approach used in the United States and that used in other countries include 
government regulation of media advertising and the fact that many stations do not carry 
advertising, although in recent years this has been changing. In particular, the use of tele-
vision advertising has been increasing in Europe, whereas in other areas of the world, such 
as South America and the Middle East, newspapers remain the major medium for promo-
tion efforts. However, there are restrictions on what can be presented. Examples include: 
(1) some countries prohibit   comparative advertising  , in which firms compare their 
products with those of the competition; (2) some countries do not allow certain products 
to be advertised because they want to discourage their use (such as alcoholic beverages 
and cigarettes) or because they want to protect national industries from MNE competition; 
and (3) some countries (such as Islamic nations) censor the use of any messages considered 
erotic. 
 Personal selling 
 Personal selling   is a direct form of promotion used to persuade customers to a particular 
point of view. Some goods, such as industrial products or those that require explanation 
or description, rely heavily on personal selling. Avon, the cosmetics company, has been 
very successful with this approach even in countries where people are unaccustomed to 
buying cosmetics from a door-to-door salesperson. In Mexico, for example, Avon man-
aged to gain acceptance by ﬁ rst introducing the idea of personal selling through a massive 
advertising campaign so that housewives became aware that the Avon salesperson was not 
a common door-to-door vendor but a professional trained to help clients look beautiful. 
the United States in 1985. The company also has operations 
in the Middle East. 
 IKEA also brought innovation to the logistics of furniture 
production by setting up groups of key suppliers to produce 
components at low cost. It has more than 2,000 suppliers 
in 50 countries around the world. These subcontractors, 
in turn, make money by getting large-volume orders for 
standardized components from IKEA. 
 The company also has kept tight control over product 
design and quality to maintain its brand name and the 
distinctive identity of its furniture. It was able to expand 
rapidly because it did not have to establish expensive 
manufacturing facilities around Europe, but rather retained 
centralized control over the subcontractors. 
 IKEA’s marketing strategy has been to build on the 
Swedish home-base stereotype of clean and efficient 
service. All furniture is well designed, modern, functional, 
durable, of high quality, and price competitive. Its image 
and brand name are well established and have survived 
numerous imitators. As a result, IKEA has been able to 
move from its Scandinavian base to being a strong regional 
player in Europe, and is now competing successfully in 
the global arena. The firm increasingly relies on a Web-
based interface with customers, with different websites 
for different countries to reflect local tastes. As with many 
consumer products firms, this is evolving from being just 
a marketing and sales tool into a market-research tool. 
The 3D kitchen designer, for example, allows customers 
to design their own kitchens online using appliances and 
furniture from IKEA. IKEA can then use these designs to 
understand changing customer preferences. 
 Overall, IKEA is a successful multinational business 
because it has introduced a highly differentiated product 
into a traditional industry and has built a globally recog-
nized brand name for high-quality, inexpensive, and attrac-
tive furniture. It has also combined the generic strategies 
of differentiation, low cost, and niching and has outsourced 
both production and delivery components of the value chain.

CHAPTER 13 MARKETING STRATEGY
Personal selling is also widely used in marketing products such as pharmaceuticals and 
sophisticated electronic equipment. For example, Pﬁ zer and Upjohn use salespeople to call 
on doctors and other individuals who are in a position to recommend their products, and 
General Electric and salespeople use the same approach in selling overseas that they use in 
the United States. 
 Because many international markets are so large, some MNEs have also turned to tele-
marketing. This approach has been very successful in the United States, and the overseas 
subsidiaries of such US firms as IBM and Ford have been using telemarketing to generate 
new sales. European firms such as Peugeot have been adopting this approach as well. 
 MNEs have also focused attention on recruiting salespeople on an international basis. 
In some countries this work is not highly regarded, so MNEs have given these people 
managerial titles that command importance, such as territory manager or zone manager. 
Recruiting local talent is extremely important because these people are often better able to 
sell to local customers. If the product requires special training to sell, MNEs often bring 
new salespeople to the home office for training, introduce them to those who are manufac-
turing the products, and create a feeling of teamwork among the field staff and personnel 
so that the salespeople are energized to go back into the field and sell.

Would the nature of VW’s products allow the company to use an identical 
promotional message worldwide, or would the company have to develop a 
country-by-country promotion strategy? 
 This answer will depend on where VW is selling its product. In less developed countries, the 
message would be geared toward economy and efficiency. In more developed countries, 
the message would focus on styling, handling, engineering, and non-economic factors 
as well. So VW would need to develop a series of different messages to address the wide 
number of market niches. No one message would appeal to everyone in the same way.  
 The pricing of goods and services in the international marketplace is often inﬂ uenced by 
factors present in home-market pricing. These factors include government controls, market 
diversity, currency ﬂ uctuations, and price escalation forces. 
 Government controls 
 Every nation has government regulations that inﬂ uence pricing practices. Some countries 
dictate minimum and maximum prices that can be charged to customers. Minimum prices 
can help protect local companies from more efﬁ cient international competitors because of 
a ﬂ oor on price that can help ensure a proﬁ t for national ﬁ rms. For example, if the mini-
mum price for a particular type of personal computer is $1,000 and local companies can 
produce and sell the product for $700, they will make $300 a unit. Foreign competitors may 
be able to produce and sell the product for $500 and make a $500 proﬁ t per unit, but the 
minimum price laws prevent them from driving out local competition. Without this law, 
 PRICING

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
overseas competitors might price the unit at $600 and then raise the price dramatically after 
local competitors went out of business. 
 Governments also prohibit   dumping  , or the selling of imported goods at a price below 
cost or below the cost in the home country. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) and WTO specifically prohibit this practice, which is designed to help MNEs drive 
out the local competition, establish a monopoly, and subsequently raise prices at will. A 
number of US firms have been influential in getting the US government to bring dumping 
charges against Japanese competitors.   
 Market diversity 
 Consumer tastes and demands vary widely in the international marketplace, resulting in 
MNEs having to price some of their products differently. For example, companies have 
found that they can charge more for goods sold overseas because of the demand. In the 
United States, there is a greater demand for light turkey meat than for dark turkey meat. 
The latter is typically sold at a lower price and is often purchased by animal food producers. 
However, the plump dark meat of turkey thighs has a strong market in Europe. As a result, 
ﬁ rms like the Shenandoah Valley Poultry Company export thousands of metric tons of dark 
turkey meat to Europe each year. 
 A second factor influencing market diversity is the perceived quality of the product. For 
example, in the United States, German auto makers such as Mercedes found that some 
Americans were willing to pay a premium for German cars. In contrast, the Japanese are 
not willing to pay a premium for German autos, so Mercedes’ pricing structure in Japan is 
different. More recently, Japanese luxury autos have proved to be strong competitors for 
Mercedes in the US market. 
 Another factor is the tax laws and attitudes about carrying debt. In the United States, 
some interest payments are tax deductible and most people have no aversion to assum-
ing at least some debt. In many other countries, interest payments are not tax deductible 
and people are unaccustomed to carrying debt. In Japan, for example, little use is made of 
consumer credit. In pricing products, MNEs will adjust the local strategy to accommodate 
the impact of the tax laws and the consumer’s willingness to assume debt.  
 Currency fluctuations 
 As noted in  Chapter 7 , when selling products overseas, MNEs often end up assuming the 
risks associated with currency ﬂ uctuations. This risk is particularly important when the 
companies have a return on investment target because this objective can become unattain-
able if the local currency is devalued. For example, if it costs Mercedes $40,000 to manufac-
ture and ship a particular model to the United States, and the company sells the car to its 
dealer for $50,000, Mercedes is making a 25 percent proﬁ t on the sale ($10,000/$40,000). 
However, if the dollar decreases in value by 10 percent against the euro, then the company’s 
proﬁ t percentage will decline and the ﬁ rm will have to choose between the following 
options: (1) increase the price of the car to the dealer to make up the loss of dollar value; 
(2) absorb the loss and leave the price the same; or (3) absorb part of the loss and raise the 
price to the dealer to make up the difference. The value of the US dollar did fall, from a high 
of 0.85 euros in 2005 to a low of 0.66 by the end of 2007. During this period Mercedes was 
forced to absorb some of the losses because price increases would have resulted in sharply 
lowered demand for the cars and even less overall proﬁ t for the company. In 2007 and 2008, 
just as happened in the late 1980s, US ﬁ rms found that their products were becoming much 
more attractive to European buyers, thanks to the lower value of the dollar and the accom-
panying rise in purchasing power of buyers on the Continent.   
 Dumping 
  The selling of imported 
goods at a price below cost 
or below that in the home 
country 

415
CHAPTER 13 MARKETING STRATEGY
 Price escalation forces 
 A problem similar to that discussed above is price escalation forces that drive up the cost 
of imported goods. In the case of Mercedes, for example, if the cost of the car rose from 
$30,000 to $33,000, the company would want to pass this along to the dealer. In the case 
of MNEs that sell through a marketing channel with a series of intermediaries, the effect 
of a price escalation can be even greater because everyone in the channel adds a percent-
age increase. For example, if an MNE exports and sells a consumer good for $10 to a large 
wholesaler and there are ﬁ ve additional intermediaries in the channel, each of whom marks 
up the good by 20 percent, as seen in  Table   13.1   , the ﬁ nal price to the consumer is $24.88. 
If the MNE’s cost rises from $10 to $13, the ﬁ nal price to the consumer is now $32.35, a 
30 percent increase. So price increases by the MNE can dramatically affect what the cus-
tomer pays, and as long as the company continues to export rather than manufacture locally, 
price will be a key marketing consideration because of its effect on consumer demand. In 
this example it is likely that customer demand would drop substantially unless there were 
no effective substitutes for the product.

How would currency fluctuations affect VW’s profit in the US market? 
 Currency fluctuations would affect VW’s profit in the US market according to the value of 
the euro in relation to the dollar. If the value of the euro were to decline, VW’s profit per 
car sold in the United States would rise because these dollars would buy more euros. 
Conversely, if the value of the euro increased, profit per car would decrease because these 
dollars would buy fewer euros.   
 The importance of international logistics was discussed in  Chapter 12 . The focus of atten-
tion here will be on the distribution differences among countries and conditions with 
which MNEs must be familiar.   Distribution   is the course that goods take between prod-
uction and the ﬁ nal consumer. This course often differs on a country-by-country basis, 
and MNEs will spend a considerable amount of time in examining the different systems in 
place, the criteria to use in choosing distributors and channels, and how to employ distri-
bution segmentation. 14

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Different distribution systems 
 It is often difﬁ cult to standardize a distribution system and use the same approach in every 
country because there are many individual differences to be considered. For example, countries 
such as Finland feature a predominance of general line retailers that carry a wide assort-
ment of merchandise. In contrast, the wholesale and retail structure in Italy is  characterized 
by a wide array of stores, many of which specialize or carry limited lines of merchandise. 
So in distributing goods in these two countries, MNEs need to employ  different strategies. 
 Consumer spending habits can also negate attempts to standardize distribution. In the 
United States, many intermediaries are geared to handling credit sales, whereas in Japan 
most consumer purchases are on a cash basis. In both Germany and the United States, 
mail-order buying has increased dramatically in recent years, whereas in Portugal and 
Spain the market is quite small. So the route that the goods take to the consumer will vary. 
 The location where consumers are used to buying will also influence distribution. In econ-
omically developed countries where supermarkets have become commonplace, customers 
purchase a wide variety of food and other products under one roof. In most countries, 
however, purchases are made in smaller stores, and distribution requires the MNE or the 
local sales manager to deal with a large number of retailers, each of which is selling a small 
amount of merchandise. In recent years, some wholesalers and retailers have been expand-
ing their operations to other countries. Wal-Mart, the giant US retailer, has expanded into 
Mexico and Europe; in 1999 it bought the British supermarket chain Asda. However, most 
intermediaries operate exclusively within one country—another factor helping to explain 
why it is still difficult to standardize distribution on an international basis.  
  Choosing the best distribution system 
 MNEs use a number of criteria in creating the most efﬁ cient distribution system. One is to get 
the best possible distributors to carry their products. A key factor in evaluating potential dis-
tributors is the ﬁ nancial strength of the wholesaler or retailer, because the multinational wants 
to know that the distributor will be able to survive in the long run. MNEs that sell goods requir-
ing periodic maintenance and servicing will be interested in businesses that can keep sufﬁ cient 
inventory on hand. This is particularly important when selling products such as autos, com-
puters, and electronic equipment. A second factor is how well connected the distributor is in 
terms of knowing the right people and providing assistance in handling governmental red tape. 
This is a key consideration for Coca-Cola when choosing overseas distributors. A third factor is 
the number and types of product lines the distributor carries currently so that the multi national 
can identify intermediaries who are most likely to give its goods a strong marketing push. 
 In many cases, distributors have competitive products or feel that they do not need to 
add any new product lines. If the multinational wants to tap into this distribution system, 
it will have to formulate an incentive program that is designed to convince the distributor 
to carry its products. Some of the ways in which this is done include (1) helping to pay 
for local promotion campaigns of the product, (2) providing generous sales incentives, 
(3) conducting marketing research to identify customer niches and sales forecasts to help 
the distributor decide how much inventory to carry, 15 and (4) ensuring that unsold or 
outmoded merchandise can be returned for a full refund. 
 Depending on the nature of the market and the competition, the multinational may give 
exclusive geographic distribution to one local seller or arrange to have a number of sellers 
jointly selling the product. For example, auto manufacturers often have more than one 
dealer in a major metropolis but are willing to give exclusive geographic distribution rights 
to dealers in rural areas. This is in contrast to food products that can be sold in a wide 
variety of outlets and for which exclusivity is unnecessary. In these cases the multinational 
will try to get a variety of distributors to carry the product.

What type of distribution system would be most effective for VW in the United 
States? 
 VW would use the same type of distribution system as that employed by other car manu-
facturers (that is, auto dealerships). The big challenge would be to open new dealerships 
and thus increase market coverage. The market in the United States is fairly well blan-
keted with dealerships, but the company could look for successful dealers who would be 
willing to carry the VW line as well as their current offerings. Another approach is to build 
VWs in the United States and thus reduce the distance the product has to be transported 
along the distribution system. This not only reduces cost but also helps ensure faster 
delivery.   
 Marketing strategies play a key role in helping MNEs formulate an overall plan of action. 
Many approaches are directly related to the major areas that have been examined in this 
chapter, including ongoing market assessment, the use of effective pricing, internet mar-
keting, and “open innovation.”  Table   13.2    illustrates the worldwide market penetration of 
several MNEs to be discussed in this section. 
 Ongoing market assessment 
 One of the major areas that MNEs are continuing to pay attention to is data collection and 
analysis for the purpose of developing and updating market assessments. In some cases this 
causes multinationals to change their market approach, whereas in other cases it supports 
maintaining a current strategy. 
 Clarins 
 The French cosmetics ﬁ rm Clarins SA is a good example of a ﬁ rm that is continuing to 
reﬁ ne its market strategy based on market assessment data. For more than two decades the 
company has been gathering feedback from customers on what they like and do not like 
about the ﬁ rm’s cosmetics. From these surveys the company has learned that women want 
makeup that is long lasting, easy to choose, and easy to apply. This information has been 
invaluable in helping Clarins increase market share in an industry where competition is 
ﬁ erce. In fact, the company’s growth rate in France has been more than twice the industry 
average, and Clarins is now achieving similar results in the US market. It is particularly 
interesting that this growth has been achieved despite the cost of Clarins’ products. For 
example, one of its facial hydrating formulas sells for over $50. Aware of what up-scale 
customers are willing to buy, Clarins has been very successful in using market assessment 
information to develop and market high-quality skincare products. One marketing con-
sultant has referred to Clarins as a “Body Shop for rich people”; certainly this target market 
has paid off well for the company.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Shell Oil 
 Shell Oil is an MNE whose market assessment has showed the importance of not making 
signiﬁ cant changes in product or delivery systems.       16  In recent years, Shell has limited its 
product diversiﬁ cation to tightly linked and synergistic energy and chemical businesses. 
The company has learned that it is most proﬁ table when staying close to what it knows 
best. Today Shell works to balance its upstream (exploration and production), downstream 
(reﬁ ning and marketing), and related chemical (industrial, agricultural, and petrochem-
ical) businesses. It is also developing a strong network of service stations around the world 
and has learned that its ability to assess situations and react quickly is an important element 
in its marketing strategy. 
 Shell is also famous as both an active user and a developer of scenario planning.       17 These 
were historically used to examine energy futures, in terms of supply and demand, as well as 
exploration opportunities and relative risks. But they have expanded to encompass a range 
of socio-political, economic, and environmental trends and the likelihood and impact of 
specific disruptive events. Shell is now used by many firms as a benchmark firm for tools 
and practices to help “future-proof” strategies. 
 Effective pricing 
 Some MNEs use a high-price strategy and skim the cream off the top of the market. Others 
employ a low-price strategy designed to penetrate and capture a larger share of the middle 
and lower parts of the market. Depending on the nature of the market, both strategies can 
be successful. 
 Bang & Olufsen 
 Bang & Olufsen is a Danish electronics company that manufactures stereo components, 
televisions, and video equipment. 18  The ﬁ rm targets the upper end of the market, selling 
to style-conscious consumers who are unlikely to ﬂ inch at paying $4,000 for an audio sys-
tem, $4,100 for a 28-inch color television with matching video recorder, or $5,600 for a 
28-inch video system. One of the primary reasons customers buy from Bang & Olufsen is 
that the products are well engineered and designed. Televisions are sleek, thin, and mod-
ern looking; stereo consoles are trim, polished, and futuristic in design. But, rather than 
developing a stereotypical image as a provider of “boys’ toys,” the ﬁ rm focuses heavily on 
women’s design preferences as more than half of all buying decisions are made by women 
(and they exert a strong inﬂ uence on the other half). 19  While many customers prefer to 
buy less stylish-looking products at one-third the price, Bang & Olufsen continues to have 
a steady stream of consumers who are willing to pay top dollar. Because of this, the com-
pany’s worldwide sales are now over $800 million. See more about Bang & Olufsen in the 
Real Case below.  
  Wal-Mart and Cifra Inc. 
 In 1997, Wal-Mart acquired a controlling interest in Cifra Inc. of Mexico, the country’s 
biggest retailer. 20  Established in 1957, Cifra was selling a wide variety of products by the 
1990s, from powdered milk and canned chili to Korean television sets and video cassette 
recorders. Wal-Mart’s acquisition fueled expansion throughout Mexico. Today, Wal-Mart 
has 545 stores there including department stores, warehouse retailers, clothing stores, and 
restaurants. One of Wal-Mart Cifra’s biggest selling points is low prices. The company 
pushes what is called a “bodega concept”: fast-moving, non-perishable goods that are sold 
in bulk in poor neighborhoods. By keeping gross margins in the range of 10–12 percent 
and net proﬁ ts at 3–5 percent, the bodegas are able to average over $1 million per store 
each month. These sales are more than twice those of similar Kmart and Wal-Mart stores 
in the United States.

CHAPTER 13 MARKETING STRATEGY
  Internet marketing and “open innovation” 
 The Internet is becoming a central tool, not just for marketing but for market research 
and innovation, for many multinational ﬁ rms. Because consumers, and industry buyers, 
increasingly use the Internet to assess the portfolio of products and services offered by a 
company, websites have become critically important for marketing purposes. They provide 
a window into the quality, credibility, achievements, and ethics of a ﬁ rm, all of which under-
pin its corporate brand. Moreover, this now happens across a global platform that reaches 
more people in more countries than traditional marketing media such as radio or TV.       21  
 Some large multinationals have been highly adaptive in keeping pace with the develop-
ment of more sophisticated online platforms. Many have developed quite subtle positions 
in Facebook and MySpace, for example, using these to promote specific products, but 
also convey a particular kind of image by interacting with young, early adopters on these 
kinds of user networks.       22  This kind of online branding and marketing has evolved into a 
science of its own, partly because marketers have found online platforms play by differ-
ent rules and often encourage a more liberal, unregulated environment than found in the 
‘real’ world. British advertisers, including Vodafone, Virgin Media, and insurance firm 
Prudential, withdrew adverts from Facebook when they found themselves next to the ultra 
right-wing British National Party (BNP) which was also promoting itself on the site.       23 
 As shown by the IKEA example above, firms have moved beyond using websites as 
one-way channels to present information and images to customers; now they are interac-
tive portals for developing a better understanding of, and relationship with, product and 
service “users.”   Open innovation   is the term used to describe interactive, collaborative 
networks of product or service providers and customers. They allow users of products and 
services to help shape their development, and enable companies to design, develop, and 
distribute them more efficiently, by building in user preferences.       24  The Internet has proved 
to be ideal for developing open innovation platforms. 
 Shell, above, provides a good example. It has established Shell “GameChanger”       25 as 
an online venturing network to gather radically new ideas for innovations in the “energy 
and mobility” industry. For the best ideas it can provide funds and contacts for would-be 
entrepreneurs and has a stage-gate process for assessing proof of concept into develop-
ment. The firm is effectively using the Internet to externalize part of its high-risk, blue-sky 
innovation activity. 
 Spreadshirt.com ( www.spreadshirt.com/ ) provides another good example. Rather than 
designing T-shirts and other clothing, by second-guessing changing customer preferences, 
Spreadshirt invites customers to design their own online which can then be produced by 
the firm. This is similar to Dell’s value chain business model, whereby customers can piece 
together a preferred desktop PC before ordering it. Spreadshirt’s production is outsourced 
abroad, so its main activity is to connect consumers with production processes. But, 
through the flow of design ideas coming from a global network of potential customers, it 
is able to: (1) achieve economies of scale by focusing on the standard clothing designs that 
attract the most customers; (2) assess changing customer markets, and changing market 
segments, as they evolve over time; and (3) innovate more efficiently by focusing resources 
on the best new product development opportunities. 
 It is important to understand the significance of these kinds of online activities as tools 
and techniques for helping solve some of the major dilemmas facing all multinational 
managers. Key questions faced by market analysts are: how much do we need to custom-
ize our products or services for particular market segments (geographic, demographic, 
cultural, etc.) to maximize market share and profitability? What kinds of product, service, 
design, marketing, branding features can we standardize to optimize profitability? How 
are the preferences of different customer groups changing over time and where should we

focus our innovation efforts? Open innovation and interactive Internet networks, like the 
ones described above, can harness the direct input of (often unsuspecting) customers and 
users from all around the world to help solve these dilemmas.    
 1   Marketing strategy begins with an international market assessment: the evaluation of 
the goods and services the MNE can sell in the global marketplace. There are a number 
of steps in this process, including an initial screening that is designed to determine the 
basic need potential of the company’s goods and services, followed by additional screen-
ings that culminate in a final selection of those outputs that the company will market 
internationally.  
 2   Product strategies will vary depending on the specific good and the customer. Some 
products need little or no modification, and others require extensive changes. Some of 
the factors that influence the amount of modification include economics, culture, local 
laws, and the product life cycle.  
 3   There are a number of ways in which MNEs promote their products, although the final 
decision is often influenced by the nature of the product. The two major approaches 
used in promotion are advertising and personal selling. Many multinationals try to use 
the same message worldwide because it is easier and more economical. However, this is 
not always possible because some messages either have no meaning in other languages 
or lack the impact of those in other markets. Similarly, while personal selling is used 
in some markets, in other markets the customer is unaccustomed to this promotion 
approach and non-personal approaches must be used, or the customer must be edu-
cated to accept this new form.  
 4   Pricing in international markets is influenced by a number of factors, including govern-
ment controls, market diversity, currency fluctuations, and price escalation forces.  
 5   Place strategy involves consideration of distribution, or the course goods will take 
between production and final consumer. This course often differs on a country-by-
country basis, and MNEs will spend a considerable amount of time in examining the 
different systems in place, the criteria to use in choosing distributors and channels, and 
how distribution segmentation can be accomplished.  
 6   MNEs are using a variety of marketing strategies when formulating their strategic plans. 
Three of the most important strategies are ongoing market assessment, effective pricing 
internet marketing, and ‘open innovation’.  
 7   The Internet has become an essential part of any firm’s marketing and market analysis 
toolkit. It is also ideal for developing open innovation platforms to connect better with 
users and customers.

 Bang & Olufsen 
 Introduction 
 Headquartered in Denmark and dating back to 1925, 
Bang & Olufsen has evolved into the Rolls-Royce of the 
audio and visual industry. Producing luxury televisions, 
audio systems, loudspeakers, and telephones, B&O claims 
to be in the unique position of having no direct competi-
tors. From a total of 1,400 stores in 60 countries, B&O sells 
select high-end, luxury niche products at high prices. The 
customer is typically male, over 35, and affluent, but B&O 
has also identified three other customer groups including 
the young and educated, the design fanatic, and the “gray 
gold” couples whose children have left the nest. 
 However, on the backdrop of economic downturn, the 
company experienced sharp decline in sales and incurred 
significant losses. In fiscal year 2009/2010, the result was 
(Danish Krone) DKK2,762 million in sales ($453 million) 
compared to DKK 4,225 million sales in 2005/2006, 
reflecting a sale decline of 34.62 percent. The company

derived only 3.2% of its sales from foreign markets. Its 
revenue was 0.58 percent of Sony’s 2009 revenue of 
$77,696 million. A restructuring plan included 300 layoffs 
in Denmark on October 21, 2008, and the abandonment of 
development of new mobile phones, MP3 players and 
stand-alone systems like DVD2 and HDR2. In 2009/2010 
also witnessed the decline in the B1 Shops. At the end of 
May 2010, there were a total of 703 B1 Shops across the 
world against 758 shops at the end of 2008/2009 financial 
year. The company will focus on its traditional strengths: 
high quality audio and video products as well as sound 
systems for the automotive industry. 
 The B&O’s marketing strategy 4Ps are as follows.  
 Product strategies 
 B&O’s approach to product development differs substan-
tially from industry norms. Essentially, it is believed that 
consumers often are unaware of what they want. Instead, 
ideas are generated based on a deep understanding of how 
consumers live. Consumer research, corporate ethnogra-
phers, and creative teams are replaced with the visions of 
a handful of contract designers who enjoy unprecedented 
decision-making power. All of the designers can veto any-
thing failing to meet their visionary standards and, in the 
past, product design clearly took precedence over engin-
eering capability. The popular BeoSound 9000 CD player 
was conceived without consulting the B&O engineers who 
needed two years to produce the technology making the 
design possible. That particular piece was designed by 
David Lewis, knighted by the Queen of Denmark for his 
work, while three of his B&O products are featured in the 
Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection in New 
York. Unlike those produced by Sony and Samsung, new 
B&O products come few and far between. In fiscal year 
2010, only 7 new models were released; instead products 
tend to follow differing life cycles. Many are kept on the 
market for up to a decade even without lowering prices. 
For example, the BeoLab 8000 speakers, first introduced 
in 1992 at a price of $3,000 a pair, are now selling well at 
$4,500. The BeoSound 9000 introduced in 1996 continues to 
demand a price of $4,750. Cutting-edge technology coupled 
with legendary design make this possible. In addition, each 
B&O product is part of an interconnected system, allowing 
B&O to offer living room solutions that are centrally control-
led. Although proven successful in the past, relying on only 
a handful of designers can prove a risky proposition. Key 
designers are growing older, and finding replacements can 
be troublesome.   
 Promotion 
 Demand for B&O products is stimulated in a variety of 
ways; however, the general message of pristine quality 
and design is central. Through an estimated $50 million 
(£25 million) global media planning and buying account, 
B&O promotes through varying advertising vehicles and 
also engages in advertiser-funded programming. As such, 
B&O products have appeared in  The Apprentice  as well 
as films such as  Thunderbirds  and  Charlie’s Angels . Most 
of B&O’s selling take place in the retail stores located 
in major cities across the globe. Here, well-to-do cus-
tomers can experience the powerful products first hand, 
frequently in private sessions catered to their needs. 
Lately B&O has engaged in symbiotic relationships with 
premium European car makers, supplying customized 
audio systems. The German car maker Audi was the first 
to offer the B&O sound system to its audience. The $6,155 
option was expected to entice 100 Audi buyers in the first 
year. Instead, 15 percent of A8 Audi buyers opted for the 
alternative, resulting in the system being installed in 
almost 4,000 cars. This success led to valuable promo-
tional exposure and one additional agreement with British 
car maker Aston Martin. Although 10 other European 
auto makers have expressed interest in cooperation, 
B&O chooses its partners carefully so as to protect the 
premium image. The agreement with Aston Martin was a 
result of the recognition of a similar culture and heritage 
rooted in passion, performance, design, and craftwork. 
B&O’s other B2B offerings also provide substantial expo-
sure, stimulating consumer demand. Later in 2007, B&O 
secured an agreement with the luxury Grand Lisboa hotel 
located in Macau, China. At this hotel alone, an estimated 
50,000 tourists annually will be exposed to B&O TV and 
speaker systems.  
 Place 
 B&O products have been described as art in the living 
room. They need space and air to be fully appreciated, 
which means that they must be presented to the public 
quite differently than lower-priced alternatives. Worldwide, 
B&O relies primarily on company-owned stores and private 
retailers featuring premium products. In recent years,

 1 Why does Audi use B&O equipment in its high-end 
cars? 
 2 How does B&O combine actions on product, place, 
promotion, and price?   
 3 How can B&O double its market share by expanding 
on its successful niche in the future?     
 these locations have relied more heavily on customer 
databases to gain a better understanding of the individual 
customer. So far, B&O has resisted temptations of both 
the growing Internet market and powerful big-box retailers, 
and instead continued to open company retail locations 
worldwide. Although selling premium solutions, B&O 
serves customers in both developed and developing econ-
omies worldwide. In fact, the two best-selling B&O retail 
locations are located in Moscow where there exists a small 
set of extremely rich oligarchs. The emerging economies in 
Asia with otherwise low average incomes have also proven 
to be financially attractive due to the new millionaires and 
high-end luxury enterprises catering to world travelers. 
From the regional head office in Singapore, B&O is rep-
resented in 10 countries in the Asia–Pacific Region and its 
products are available from over 40 stores.  
 Price 
 Along with all other aspects of B&O communication with 
the public, selected retail prices match the general mes-
sage of exclusivity. For example, retailing for $13,250.00, 
the 40-inch BeoVision 7 HDTV commands a premium price 
over other TV alternatives. The company targets a very 
limited segment (niche) of the world population, and can 
command these prices due to documented premium qual-
ity and sustainability of its products. The substantial profit 
margin has the advantage of shielding the company against 
unfortunate economic conditions. In late 2007, the US dol-
lar depreciated substantially against the world’s premier 
currencies. If prices are left unchanged, this translates 
directly into lower profits for foreign companies operat-
ing in the United States and exchanging dollars into home 
currency. In the case of B&O, a substantial part of sourced 
components originates from the United States, which 
meant that production costs decreased accordingly.  
 Conclusion 
 In the coming years, B&O hopes to grow its market share 
by focusing on its niche. In doing so, the company must 
carefully consider what action to take and what message 
product, place, promotion, and price should send to make 
its goal a reality.

 Brazilian soap operas: a world market 
   I let myself get hooked on Brazilian soap operas. But those 
are so wild and over-the-top, the whole country stops to watch 
them. They’re nothing like American soaps.   
  Paula Sharp, US writer  
 When  Roque Santeiro  aired in Brazil after 10 years of censor-
ship, São Paulo, a city comparable to New York, suddenly 
came to a halt. The 8.00 pm soap opera has become a ritual in 
many households; people leave anything they are doing to 
glue themselves to the TV. Not surprisingly, leading TV stations 
compete heavily for this market. Indeed, soap operas are the 
main source of income for Brazilian TV stations, including TV 
Globo, Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão (SBT), and Manchete. 
 Fierce competition has helped Brazilian soap operas 
become among the very best in the world.  Roque Santeiro 
revolutionized editing and launched its scriptwriter as an 
icon in Brazil. Period-set costumes were used for  Escrava 
Isaura.  And in  Torre de Babel , the shopping mall in which 
most of the action takes place was built for $1.1 million, 
only to be blown to pieces as the plot developed. 
 Brazilian soap operas differ from their American coun-
terparts by their running time and the structure of their

plot. While American soap operas can run for 10 years 
or more, Brazilian soap operas run an average of eight 
months and tend to have a very specific storyline and plot 
structure. 
 With a population of 172 million, Portuguese-speaking 
Brazil is one of the biggest markets for soap operas in the 
world. It is also one of the biggest producing countries, at 
nearly 20 soaps per year, as well as a leading exporter. 
Soap operas from Brazil are dubbed into foreign languages 
and exported to 128 countries around the world, includ-
ing the United States, China, Italy, and Spanish-speaking 
Latin America. In Cuba, the communist government even 
rescheduled its electric energy rationing to allow citizens 
to tune into  Escrava Isaura . Since its Brazilian premiere 
in 1977,  Escrava Isaura , the story of a white slave on a 
Brazilian plantation, has been aired in nearly 80 countries. 
 Why are Brazilian soaps so successful? One reason is 
that audiences in other non-triad nations can identify with 
what is portrayed as Brazilian reality. Since their beginning 
in the 1960s, Brazilian soap operas have often dealt with 
such controversial issues as religion, the role of the state, 
class differences, abortion, sexuality, and racism. These 
issues were portrayed with due consideration to Brazil’s 
predominantly conservative and religious audience. Soap 
operas have become not only entertainment but also a 
means for social dialogue in Brazil. The audience shares 
the plot lines with friends and co-workers and discusses 
the moral dilemmas that are brought up in the story. 
TV stations have also tended to borrow from the proven 
success of stories in other media. The literary works of 
Mario Benedetti, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jorge Amado, João 
Guimaraes Rosa, the classics of Greek and Roman litera-
ture, and folk stories have all inspired soap operas. These 
universal themes help Brazil export its soap operas around 
the world. Whenever the story is an original, as it often is, 
it has more in common with a novel (not surprisingly the 
name for soap operas in Brazil is  telenovelas ) than with the 
scattered plot line of an American soap. 
  TV Globo 
 In terms of audience, the fourth-largest private TV network 
in the world is Brazil’s TV Globo, which held 54 percent of 
the Brazilian viewership in 2003 and over 77 percent of the 
TV advertising market. TV Globo is part of the Globo Group, 
which also controls the country’s number one radio sta-
tion, the second-largest magazine group, and the cable TV 
company Globo Cabo. 
 TV Globo had its beginning in 1965 with the inauguration 
of Channel 4 in Rio de Janeiro. Soon after, the company 
purchased TV Paulista to broadcast in São Paolo, Brazil’s 
biggest city. To enter the Belo Horizonte market, the com-
pany acquired J. B. Amaral Group in 1968, then expanded 
in 1971 to Recife by purchasing the Vitor Costa Group. 
By 2003, a combination of acquisitions and broadcasting 
licenses had made TV Globo the largest network in Brazil, 
with 115 TV stations reaching 99.98 percent of Brazil’s 
population. 
 It was in 1966 that TV Globo produced its first two soap 
operas. At first they were relatively low budget, but by 
2000 production costs reached over $100,000 per one-
hour episode, a sizable expense for a Brazilian produc-
tion. Because a 30-second ad during the 8 pm soap opera 
costs approximately $102,000, soaps constitute the largest 
source of income for TV Globo. The firm has its own record-
ing studios with a staff of 1,500 scriptwriters, and its soaps 
are the most successful in the market, capturing upwards 
of 60 percent of the audience. 
 At less than 10 percent of total sales, foreign sales are a 
tiny but growing portion of revenues for producers. A one-
hour soap opera episode can be priced anywhere between 
$300 in Cuba and $40,000 in Italy. The number of TV sets 
per capita, the purchasing power of the country, and the 
amount that the stations can earn on advertising deter-
mine prices to foreign TV stations. In collaboration with 
Telelatino, the US-based broadcaster, TV Globo is planning 
to enter the US market with a $10 billion, 150-episode soap 
opera called  At All Costs . The target group is the large Latin 
American market. TV Globo will use its proven storylines 
and reshoot them with an all-Spanish-speaking cast from 
different Latin American countries. 
 TV Globo faces competition on various fronts. In the 
domestic market, SBT and Manchete produce their own 
soaps to compete with those of TV Globo. Although TV 
Globo remains by far the most successful, other domestic 
networks have been able to erode the 80 percent audience 
the network enjoyed in the late 1970s. TV Globo’s response 
was to support its own star system, invest in a scriptwrit-
ing school in São Paolo, and create stories that are more 
responsive to TV audiences. The station is very protective of 
its directors, scriptwriters, and actors, often keeping them 
sitting idle under salary rather than allowing them to go to 
the competition. Audience panels and rating information 
are used to change plots of soaps that do not reach desired 
ratings. 
 TV Globo also faces competition from established soap 
opera industries in other Latin American countries, includ-
ing Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. Although 
these productions have a limited share of the Brazilian 
market, TV Globo competes with them in their own markets 
and in non-Latin American markets. These competitors 
have traditionally made lower-quality soaps. Over the last 
few years, however, improvements in casting, scriptwrit-
ing, and directing have begun to increase their notoriety in 
international markets. 
 During Ramadan, mosques in Côte d’Ivoire changed the

episode of the Mexican soap  Marimar . This soap was also 
an international hit in Indonesia and the Philippines, where 
the female lead actress was received with all the honors 
of royalty. 
 Another source of competition comes from importing 
nations, such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and China. 
Local storylines are being created that are likely to erode 
TV Globo’s market share. Growing competition from foreign 
companies is forcing TV Globo to find innovative ways of 
capitalizing a market. For example, it recently partnered 
with a Chinese company to develop a soap about a Chinese 
man who falls in love with a Brazilian woman and goes to 
Brazil to court her. This guarantees access to the Chinese 
market. 
 Thirty-five years of experience in the soap opera market 
have given Brazil and TV Globo a competitive advantage 
against new entrants. As production develops in these 
countries, however, Brazil must adapt to increasing com-
petition to continue its lead. There are a number of ways 
in which to do this, including specializing in some types of 
soaps, partnering with foreign producers, and moving into 
other areas of entertainment. In fact, the soap opera busi-
ness has left Brazil with excellent producers, scriptwriters, 
directors, camera operators, editors, and actors who can 
be used to create anything from commercials, drama 
series, and sitcoms to theater and films. This last has 
already begun to occur. In 1999, a long-acclaimed Brazilian 
soap opera actress, Fernanda Montegro, was nominated 
for a best actress Oscar for her part in  Central Station , a 
movie that was also nominated for best foreign film.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Human resource management strategy provides an MNE with the 
opportunity to truly outdistance its competition. For example, if HP 
develops a laser printer that is smaller, lighter, and less expensive 
than competitive models, other firms in the industry will attempt 
to reverse-engineer this product to see how they can develop their 
own version. However, when a multinational has personnel who 
are carefully selected, well trained, and properly compensated, 
it has a pool of talent that the competition may be unable to beat. 
Products and brands may, to some extent, be imitable; knowledge 
and capabilities, and the processes that combine and leverage them 
for competitive advantage, tend not to be. For this reason, human 
resource management (HRM) is a critical element of international 
management strategy. This chapter considers the ways in which 
multinationals prepare their people to take on the challenges of 
international business. We focus specifically on such critical areas 
as selection, training, managerial development, compensation, and 
labor relations. 
     The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Define  the term  international human resource management and 
discuss human resource strategies in overseas operations.  
 2  Describe  the screening and selection criteria often used in 
choosing people for overseas assignments.  
 3  Relate  some of the most common types of training and 
development that are offered to personnel who are going 
overseas. 
 4  Discuss  the common elements of an international compensation 
package. 
 5  Explain  some of the typical labor relations practices used in the 
international arena.  
 6  Describe  some of the human resource management strategies that 
are currently receiving a great deal of attention from MNEs.

CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
 The Coca-Cola Company has been operating internation-
ally for most of its 120-year history, since it first started 
operations in Canada in 1906. Today the company oper-
ates in 200 countries and employs 139,600 people as at 
2010. Its human resource management (HRM) strategy 
helps explain a great deal of its success. It now follows a 
strategy of “national responsiveness” by adapting to local 
market conditions. For example, it transferred more than 
300 professional and managerial staff from one country 
to another under its leadership development program, 
and the number of international transferees is increasing 
annually. One senior-level HRM manager explained Coca-
Cola’s strategy by noting: 
  We recently concluded that our talent base needs to be 
multilingual and multicultural. . . . To use a sports analogy, 
you want to be sure that you have a lot of capable and com-
petent  bench strength , ready to assume broader responsi-
bilities as they present themselves.  
 In preparing for the future, Coca-Cola includes a human 
resource recruitment forecast in its annual and long-term 
business strategies. It also has selection standards on 
which management can focus when recruiting and hiring. 
For example, the company likes applicants who are fluent 
in more than one language because they can be trans-
ferred to other geographic areas where their fluency will 
help them to be part of Coca-Cola’s operation. 
 The firm also has a recruitment program that helps it 
identify candidates at the college level. Rather than just 
seeking students abroad, Coca-Cola looks for foreign 
students who are studying in the United States at domes-
tic universities. The students are recruited in the United 
States and then provided with a year’s training before 
they go back to their home country. Coca-Cola also has an 
internship program for foreign students who are interested 
in working for the company during school breaks, either in 
the United States or back home. These interns are put into 
groups and assigned a project that requires them to make 
a presentation to the operations personnel, including a dis-
cussion of what worked and what did not. The interns are 
then evaluated individually and management decides their 
future potential with the company. 
 Coca-Cola believes these approaches are extremely 
useful in helping to find talent on a global basis. Not only 
is the company able to develop internal sources, but its 
intern program provides a large number of additional indi-
viduals who would otherwise end up with other companies. 
Coca-Cola earns a greater portion of its income and profit 
overseas than it does in the United States. Its HRM strategy 
helps explain how, despite the success of its policies, Coca-
Cola found itself facing a series of problems as it entered 
the millennium. During the 1980s the firm expanded its 
global reach and began to centralize control and encour-
age consolidation among all bottling partners. In the 1990s, 
however, the world began to change. Many national and 
local leaders began seeking sovereignty over their politi-
cal, economic, and cultural futures. As a result, the very 
forces that were making the world more connected and 
homogeneous were also triggering a powerful desire for 
local autonomy and the preservation of unique cultural 
identity. Simply put, the world was demanding more nim-
bleness, responsiveness, and sensitivity from MNEs, while 
Coca-Cola was centralizing decision making, standardizing 
operating practices, and insulating itself from this chang-
ing environment. It was going global when it should have 
been going local. 
 Today, Coca-Cola is beginning to turn things around. 
Under its most internationally experienced CEO ever, 
Neville Isdell, it is focusing on marketing-led growth. In 
particular, it has begun implementing three principles 
designed to make it more locally responsive. First, it is 
instituting a strategy of “Think local, act local” by putting 
more decision making in the hands of local managers. 
Second, it is focusing itself as a pure marketing company 
that pushes its brands on a regional and local basis. Third, 
it is working to become a model citizen by reaching out 
to the local communities and getting involved in civic and 
charitable activities. In the past, Coca-Cola succeeded 
because it understood and appealed to global commonal-
ities; in the future it hopes to succeed by better under-
standing and appealing to local differences.

Does the Coca-Cola Company have a local perspective regarding the role of human resource 
management?

On what basis does Coca-Cola choose people for international assignments? Identify and describe two. 
 3 
What type of training does Coca-Cola provide to its interns? Of what value is this training?   
 4 
How useful is it for Coca-Cola’s managers to be fluent in more than one language? Why?     
 International human resource management (IHRM)   is the process of selecting, training, 
developing, and compensating personnel in overseas positions. This chapter will exam-
ine each of these activities. Before doing so, however, it is important to clarify the general 
nature of this overall process, which begins with selecting and hiring. 
 There are three basic sources of personnel talent that MNEs can tap for positions.       1 One 
is   home-country nationals  , who reside abroad but are citizens of the multinational’s 
parent country. These individuals are typically called   expatriates  . An example is a US 
manager assigned to head an R&D department in Tokyo for IBM Japan. A second is 
 host-country nationals , who are local people hired by the MNE. An example is a British 
manager working for Ford Motor Company in London. The last is   third-country nationals , 
who are citizens of countries other than the one in which the MNE is headquartered or the 
one in which it has assigned them to work. An example is a French manager working for 
Sony in the United States. 
 Staffing patterns may vary depending on the length of time the MNE has been operat-
ing. Many MNEs will initially rely on home-country managers to staff their overseas units, 
gradually putting more host-country nationals into management positions as the firm 
gains experience. Another approach is to use home-country nationals in less developed 
countries and employ host-country nationals in more developed regions, a pattern that is 
fairly prevalent among US and European MNEs. 2  A third pattern is to put a new oper ation 
under the supervision of a home-country manager but turn it over to a host-country 
manager once it is up and running.  Figure  14.1 provides an illustration of the types of 
managers, by nationality mix, required over the stages of internationalization. When an 
MNE is exporting into a foreign market, host-country nationals will handle everything. 
As the firm begins initial manufacture in that country, the use of expatriate managers and 
third-country nationals begins to increase. As the company moves through the ensuing 
stages of internationalization, the nationality mix of the managers in the overseas unit 
continues to change to meet the shifting demands of the environment. 
 In some cases staffing decisions are handled uniformly. For example, most Japanese 
MNEs rely on home-country managers to staff senior-level positions. Similarly, some 
European MNEs assign home-country managers to overseas units for their entire careers. 
US MNEs typically view overseas assignments as temporary, so it is more common to find 
many of these expatriates working under the supervision of host-country managers. 
 The size of the compensation package also plays an important role in personnel selec-
tion and placement. As the cost of sending people overseas has increased, there has been a 
trend toward using host-country or third-country nationals who know the local language 
and customs. For example, many US multinationals have hired English or Scottish man-
agers for the top positions at subsidiaries in former British colonies such as Jamaica, India, 
the West Indies, and Kenya. 3

Does the Coca-Cola Company have a local perspective regarding the role of 
human resource management? 
 The company certainly does have a local perspective regarding the HRM role. Coca-Cola is 
interested in recruiting people from anywhere in the world, training and developing them, 
and sending them to assignments around the globe. It does not confine itself to recruiting, 
training, developing, or promoting people from any one particular region or country. Both 
Americans and non-Americans have equal opportunities in the company, further reinforc-
ing this international perspective.   
 Two of the major HRM challenges facing MNEs are those of selecting qualiﬁ ed people for 
overseas assignments and, in the case of home-country nationals, effectively repatriating 
them into the workforce upon their return. Each presents a signiﬁ cant challenge. 
 SELECTION AND REPATRIATION 

434
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
  International screening criteria and selection procedures 
 International screening criteria   are those factors used to identify the individuals regarded 
as most suitable for overseas assignment. Some MNEs use an extensive list, whereas others rely 
on only a handful of factors. A number of screening criteria are commonly used in determin-
ing who to send overseas. These criteria focus on both individual and family considerations.  
 Adaptability 
 One criterion is an individual’s ability to adapt to cultural change.       5  Research shows that 
many managers are initially pleased to learn they are being sent overseas. However, within 
a few months many of them begin to suffer from culture shock brought on by the large 
number of changes to which they are subjected. This often results in a decline in job 
 satisfaction. However, as they continue their overseas assignment, satisfaction goes back up. 
Torbiorn, for example, reports that by the end of the ﬁ rst year most managers are through 
the cultural change phase and are beginning to adjust to their new conditions. Among those 
who stay overseas for two or more years, Torbiorn has found that satisfaction reaches new 
heights and continues rising. 6  Researchers have also found that men tend to adjust slightly 
faster than women, and that people over the age of 35 have somewhat higher levels of 
 satisfaction after the ﬁ rst year. 
 In determining how well an individual will adapt to cultural change, MNEs examine a 
number of characteristics, including (1) work experiences with cultures other than one’s 
own, (2) previous overseas travel, (3) knowledge of foreign languages (fluency is not gen-
erally necessary), (4) the ability to solve problems within different frameworks and from 
different perspectives, and (5) overall sensitivity to the environment. 7 
 Self-reliance 
 Managers who are posted to overseas assignments must be self-reliant and independent 
because they often have to make on-the-spot decisions without consulting the home ofﬁ ce. 
In determining self-reliance, MNEs evaluate the amount of ﬁ eld experience the individual 
has had, as well as experience in special projects and task forces—assignments that often 
require and nurture self-reliance. Consideration is also given to hobbies or avocations that 
require a high degree of personal independence.  
  Age, experience, and education 
 MNEs often ﬁ nd that young managers are eager for international assignments and want to 
learn more about other cultures. On the other hand, older managers have more experience 
and maturity to bring to the assignment. To balance the strengths of the two groups, many 
ﬁ rms send both young and seasoned personnel to the same overseas post so that each can 
learn from the other. 
 Some MNEs believe that a college degree, preferably a graduate degree, is important 
for international managers. However, there is no universal agreement on this point. 
Multinationals that sell highly technical products tend to prefer people with science 
degrees. Others hold that a good education helps develop logical thinking, creative ideas, 
and a broad perspective of the world, so they prefer individuals with a liberal arts education. 
  Health and family status 
 Expatriates must have good physical and emotional health. Those with physical problems 
that will limit their activities are screened from consideration. So are those judged less likely 
to withstand culture shock. 
 Multinationals also take into account a person’s family situation. An unhappy family life 
will hurt employee productivity. One survey of US multinationals found that the  primary

CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
reason for expatriate failure was the inability of the manager’s spouse to adjust to a dif-
ferent physical or cultural environment. For this reason, some firms interview both the 
spouse  and the manager before deciding whether to approve the assignment. 8 
 The increasing number of dual-career families in Western countries creates a further 
challenge for MNEs. Equally career-minded spouses might find their careers interrupted 
during their spouses’ overseas assignments. In fact, a study of 332 repatriates and spouses 
found most dissatisfaction with MNEs resulted from lack of employment support for the 
trailing spouse. 9 
 Motivation and leadership 
 Another selection criterion is the individual’s desire to work abroad and potential com-
mitment to the new job. Many people who are unhappy with their position at home will 
consider an overseas assignment, but this is not sufﬁ cient motivation. Motivational factors 
include a desire for adventure, a pioneering spirit, a desire to increase one’s chances for pro-
motion, and the opportunity to improve one’s economic status. 10 
 Additionally, one group of researchers recently examined the factors associated with 
employee willingness to work overseas and concluded the following: 
 ■   Unmarried employees are more willing than any other group to accept expat 
assignments. 
 ■   Married couples without children at home or those with non-teenage children are 
probably the most willing to move.  
 ■   Prior international experience seems associated with willingness to work as an 
expatriate. 
 ■   Individuals most committed to their professional careers and to their employing 
organizations are prone to be more willing to work as expatriates.  
 ■  Careers and attitudes of spouses will likely have a significant impact on employee 
willingness to move overseas. 
 Employee and spouse perceptions of organizational support for expats are also critical 
to employee willingness to work overseas.       11 
 Applicants are also evaluated on the basis of their leadership potential, since most 
expatriates end up supervising others. Although this is a difficult factor to assess, a number 
of characteristics are commonly sought when making this evaluation, including maturity, 
emotional stability, the ability to communicate well, independence, initiative, and creativ-
ity. These characteristics are good indications of leadership potential.  
 Selection procedures 
 The most common selection procedure is the interview. A general consensus is that exten-
sive interviews of candidates and their spouses by senior executives still ultimately provide 
the best method of selection. For example, 52 percent of the US MNEs that Tung surveyed 
conducted interviews with both the manager and the spouse, whereas 47 percent conducted 
interviews with the candidate alone. In the case of technically oriented positions, these 
percentages were 40 and 59 percent. Other MNEs follow a similar pattern. Based on her 
research, Tung has concluded that multinationals are becoming increasingly cognizant of 
the importance of interviewing in effective performance abroad.       12 
 Some companies also use tests to help in making the final choice of who will perform 
well in overseas assignments. However, this approach has not gained a great deal of support 
because it is expensive and many MNEs feel that tests do not improve the selection process. 
As a result, the candidate’s domestic record and evaluations from superiors and peers, along 
with the interview, tend to be relied on most heavily.  

436
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Repatriation of expats 
 Repatriation   is the process of returning home at the end of an overseas assignment. 
Managers are repatriated for a number of reasons. The most common one is that the pre-
determined time assignment is completed. For expatriates, an overseas assignment usually 
lasts two to three years, although some companies are now encouraging their people to con-
sider making the international arena a lifetime career choice. Another reason is the desire to 
have their children educated in the home country. The expatriate may be unhappy overseas 
and the company may feel there is more to be gained by bringing the person back than in 
trying to persuade the individual to stay on. Finally, as in any position, if a manager has 
performed poorly, the MNE may decide to put someone else in the position.  
 Readjusting 
 Although many expatriates look forward to returning, some ﬁ nd it difﬁ cult to adjust. A 
number of reasons can be cited. One is that the home-ofﬁ ce job lacks the high degree of 
authority and responsibility the expat had in the overseas job. Another is that the expat feels 
the company does not value international experience and the time spent overseas seems to 
have been wasted in terms of career progress. 13 A third reason is a change in the standard 
of living. While overseas, many expats have generous living allowances and beneﬁ ts that 
they cannot match back home. An accompanying problem is the change in cultural life-
style. For example, a person who is transferred from a cosmopolitan city such as Vienna to 
a small town in Middle America may ﬁ nd it necessary to make major adjustments, rang-
ing from social activities to the pace of life in general. Additionally, it is common to ﬁ nd 
that those who sold their house before leaving and have been overseas from three to ﬁ ve 
years are stunned by the high price of a replacement home. Not only have they lost a great 
deal of equity by selling, but they must also come up with a substantial down payment and 
much larger monthly mortgage payments. Some companies do not have plans for handling 
returning managers. If these individuals are assigned jobs at random, they can ﬁ nd their 
career progress jeopardized. 
 Recent research shows that the longer people remain overseas, the more problems they 
are likely to have being reabsorbed into the operations back home. In addition to the fac-
tors considered above, several factors make repatriation of such people after longer periods 
difficult: (1) they may no longer be familiar to people at headquarters; (2) their old jobs 
may have been eliminated or drastically changed; or (3) technological advances at head-
quarters may have rendered their existing skills and knowledge obsolete. 
 In many cases, it takes from 6 to 12 months before a returning manager is operating 
at full effectiveness. Adler reports that many expatriates have moderate to low effective-
ness for the first 60 to 90 days, but they become more effective month after month as they 
readjust to life back home. 14 
 Adjustment strategies 
 In recent years, MNEs have begun to address adjustment problems faced by returning 
expatriates. Some have now developed   transition strategies   that are designed to help 
smooth the move from foreign to domestic assignments. 
 One of these strategies is the  repatriation agreement , which spells out how long a 
person will be posted overseas and sets forth the type of job the person will be given upon 
returning. The agreement typically does not spell out a particular position or salary, but 
it does promise a job that is at least equal in authority and compensation to the one the 
person held overseas. Such an agreement relieves a great deal of the anxiety expatriates 
encounter because it assures them that the MNE is not going to forget them while they are 
gone and that there will be a place for them when they return.

437
CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
 A second strategy is to rent or maintain the expatriate’s home during the overseas tour. 
Both Union Carbide and the Aluminum Company of America have such arrangements. 
These plans help reduce the financial burden managers face when they go on a three-year 
or four-year tour. 
 A third strategy is to assign a senior executive as a sponsor for every manager posted 
abroad. This ensures that there is someone looking after each expatriate and ensuring that 
his or her performance, compensation, and career path are on track. When the expatriate 
is scheduled to return home, the sponsor begins working internally to ensure a suitable pos-
ition. Companies such as IBM and Union Carbide use this form of the mentoring process, 
which is proving to be very effective. 
 A fourth strategy is to maintain ongoing communications with expatriate managers, 
ensuring that they are aware of what is happening in the home office. If they are sched-
uled to be home on leave for any extended period of time, the company works them into 
projects at headquarters. In this way they can maintain their visibility at headquarters and 
increase the likelihood that they are viewed as regular members of the management staff 
rather than as outsiders. 
 These strategies that help MNEs maintain a proactive approach in dealing with expatri-
ate concern are becoming more widespread. The best-managed multinational firms tend 
to have (1) mentor programs consisting of one-on-one pairing of an expatriate with a 
member of the home-office senior management staff, (2) a separate organization unit with 
primary responsibility for the specific needs of expatriates, and/or (3) maintenance of 
constant contacts between the home office and the expatriate.       15

On what basis does Coca-Cola choose people for international assignments? 
Identify and describe two. 
 One of the bases on which Coca-Cola chooses people is the ability to speak at least two 
languages fluently. A second is familiarity with at least two cultures. Both are viewed as 
critical for success in international assignments.   
 Training   is the process of altering employee behaviors and attitudes in a way that increases the 
probability of goal attainment.   Managerial development   is the process by which man agers 
obtain the necessary skills, experiences, and attitudes they need to become or remain suc-
cessful leaders. Training programs are designed to provide those who are going overseas with 
information and experience related to local customs, cultures, and work habits, thus helping 
them interact and work more effectively with local employees.       16  Development is typically 
used to help managers improve their leadership skills, stay up to date on the latest manage-
ment developments, increase their overall effectiveness, and maintain high job satisfaction.       17 
 Types of training 
 MNEs use several types of training and development programs.       18  These can be grouped 
into two general categories: standardized and tailor-made.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Standardized training programs   are generic and can be used with managers anywhere 
in the world. Examples include programs for improving quantitative analysis or techni-
cal skills that can be used universally. Research reveals that many behaviorally oriented 
concepts can also be handled with a standardized program (although follow-up programs 
must be tailor-made to meet specific country needs). Examples include programs designed 
to acquaint participants with the fundamentals of communicating with, motivating, or 
leading people. Another form of standardized training presently offered by large MNEs 
addresses cultural differences on a global scale. For instance, with operations in 200 countries, 
managers of Colgate-Palmolive are often exposed to more than one foreign culture. To 
address this, the company has offered cultural diversity training to its managers.       19 
 Tailor-made training programs   are designed to meet the specific needs of participants 
and typically include a large amount of culturally based input. These programs are more 
commonly developed by large MNEs and by multinationals that need a working knowl-
edge of the local country’s beliefs, norms, attitudes, and work values. Quite often the input 
for the programs is provided by managers who are currently working in the country (or 
have recently worked there) and by local managers and personnel who are citizens of that 
country. In most cases this training is provided to expatriates before they leave for their 
assignment, but in some cases it is provided on site.   
 Research shows that the following six types of programs are most popular: 
 1   Environmental briefings used to provide information about such things as geography, 
climate, housing, and schools. 
 2   Cultural orientation designed to familiarize the participants with cultural institutions 
and value systems of the host country.  
 3   Cultural assimilators using programmed learning approaches designed to provide the 
participants with intercultural encounters. 
 4  Language training. 
 5  Sensitivity training designed to develop attitudinal flexibility. 
 6   Field experience, which sends the participant to the country of assignment to undergo 
some of the emotional stress of living and working with people from a different culture.       20 
 Typically, MNEs use a combination of the above programs, tailoring the package to fit 
their specific needs. A good example is provided by Underwriters Laboratories Inc., which 
uses a two-day, in-house program to train those personnel who will be dealing extensively 
with Japanese clients in the United States. The program is designed around a series of mini-
lectures that cover a wide range of topics, from how to handle introductions to the proper 
way of exchanging gifts. It employs a variety of training techniques, including lectures, 
case studies, role-playing, language practice, and a short test on cultural terminology. The 
two-day training wraps up with a 90-minute question-and-answer period during which 
participants are given the opportunity to gain additional insights into how to develop 
effective client relationships. 
 Some firms extend their training focus to include families. In addition to providing lan-
guage training, firms such as General Electric Medical Systems (GEMS) Group, a Milwaukee-
based firm with expatriates in France, Japan, and Singapore, match up the family that is going 
overseas with another family that has been assigned to this country or geographic region. The 
latter family will then share many of the problems it faced during the overseas assignment 
and relate some of the ways these situations were resolved. It is also common to find MNEs 
offering cultural training to all family members, not just to the manager. This helps create a 
support group that will work together to deal with problems that arise during the overseas 
assignment. The case  International Business Strategy in Action: P&O, Carnival, and Dubai 
Port World details how an MNE’s IHRM training is tightly related to its global expansion.

CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
 P&O, Carnival, and Dubai Port World 
 Few people know that the “Princess” cruise ships, which 
were the “love boats” of TV fame, were at the time owned 
by British P&O Princess Cruises plc. The Peninsular and 
Orient Steam Navigation Company, known as P&O, was the 
sea transportation backbone of the old British Empire. In 
the nineteenth century it won British government contracts 
to deliver mail (post) to the Spanish peninsula and (via 
Africa and the Indian subcontinent) to Australia and the Far 
East. In the past P&O’s ships have been commandeered by 
the British government in wartime to serve as transport 
vessels. In the Falklands War of 1982, the large flagship 
 Canberra  played a central role in the British war effort. 
 In January 2000, P&O Princess Cruises was spun off 
from P&O. Since then it has been known as P&O Princess 
Cruises International Ltd. It was then taken over by 
Carnival plc in August 2002. Carnival became the ultimate 
parent of P&O Princess Cruises. Carnival’s stock is dually 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange under symbol CCL 
and on the London Stock Exchange under symbol POC. 
Headquartered in Miami, Carnival operates 100 ships 
whereas P&O Princess Cruises still maintains its head 
office in London. 
 Today, Carnival, including P&O Princess Cruises, is 
the largest cruise company in the world with revenues 
of US $15,782.9 million, net income $8,665.1 million and 
total assets of $1,417,089.8 million in 2009. In June 2011, 
P&O Princess Cruises owner Carnival has ordered a new 
141,000 tonne cruise liner which it says will be the largest 
built specifically for the British market. The liner, costing 
€559m ($807m; £489m) and scheduled to enter service in 
March 2015, will be built by Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri. 
The as-yet unnamed ship will be able to carry a maximum 
of 4,372 passengers. Rival Royal Caribbean claims to have 
the world’s biggest cruise ship,  Allure of the Seas , weighing 
225,282 tonnes. The 16-deck  Allure  can carry 5,400 guests 
and went into service in late 2010. 
 With an older population of North American and 
European “baby boomers,” the growth of cruises has been 
striking. Occupancy is usually at 100 percent capacity. 
The industry is also now trying to attract a younger demo-
graphic. Carnival now owns 12 brands. It is the leading 
cruise operator along the North American West Coast to 
Alaska, an area that P&O Princess Cruises had dominated. 
To enter the continental Europe market, P&O Princess 
Cruises purchased a majority stake in Germany’s AIDA in 
1999 and the remaining stake in 2000. It also purchased 
Germany’s Seetours, a competing cruise line with 40 years 
of experience, and merged it with AIDA. Since then, AIDA 
has become the best-known cruise line in Germany. These 
brands are now incorporated under the Carnival name.     
 Prior to the merger with Carnival, P&O Group faced an 
interesting strategic challenge of integrating diverse 
businesses, from trucks to boat shows, from ports man-
agement to luxury cruise ship excursions. In particular, it 
needed to link its port management business and its very 
capital-intensive cargo ships, which require good infor-
mation technology and operational efficiency, with its cruise 
ships, which are in the leisure and entertainment business. 
Molding an engineering and technical culture with the 
marketing, sales, and service activities of the cruise ships 
is an interesting managerial challenge that the P&O Group 
tackled by providing extensive management training

programs. For example, in the late 1990s, it developed a 
series of senior management programs at Templeton 
College, Oxford University, which both improved business 
efficiency and moved managers into new areas of customer 
service, such as environmental and regulatory issues. As a 
result, P&O Group was a successful and growing business 
with a global mindset among its managers. 
 In 2006, the port business of P&O was purchased by 
Dubai Port World Limited (DP World) for $6.8 billion. 
Strategically located in the Persian Gulf, DP World is a 
world-class port operator by the 1990s with ports in the 
Middle East, India, and Europe. The company is an arm’s-
length commercial enterprise of the UAE government and 
it is run by an international management team that includes 
US citizens. Nonetheless, the deal brought a lot of criticism 
from within the United States because of concerns over 
national security. Congress intervened to review the deal, 
although both P&O and DP World were foreign-owned 
firms, and so there was really no legal basis for rejection of 
the DP World ownership. President Bush, whose adminis-
tration had already reviewed the merger with DP World and 
approved it, threatened to veto any congressional action 
against the deal. The opposition came as a surprise to DP 
World since ports in the United States are but a small frac-
tion of P&O’s business. Yet, within a month of DP World 
taking over P&O, it sold all of its US port management 
assets to AIG Global Investment Group, a US firm. 
 Today DP World, together with its subsidiaries, operates 
in the business of international marine terminal oper-
ations and development, logistics, and related services. 
In 2010, it operates 50 marine terminals in 28 countries 
worldwide to a gross capacity of 67 million TEU (twenty-
foot equivalent unit) and has a further nine projects under 
development and major extensions. It provides logistics, 
infrastructure development and consultancy services. Its 
logistics services include general and bulk cargo handling, 
roll on, roll off vessels handling, and passenger terminals 
handling. It has other subsidiaries located in different 
countries such as P&O in the United Kingdom, DP World 
FZE in the United Arab Emirates, and DP World Maritime 
Cooperative U.A. in the Netherlands, among others. For 
the fiscal year ended 31 December 2010, DP World’s total 
revenue increased 9 percent to $3.078 billion compared to 
the previous year. DP World started trading on the London 
Stock Exchange alongside the existing Nasdaq Dubai list-
ing in June 2011.

What type of training does Coca-Cola provide to its interns? Of what value is 
this training? 
 The company puts interns into groups and assigns projects that require them to investi-
gate or study certain areas of operations. The interns are then evaluated on the outcome. 
This training is useful in helping the firm identify those individuals who offer the most 
promise for the company.   
 In recent years compensation has become a primary area of IHRM attention.       21  On the one 
hand, multinationals want to hire the most competent people. On the other hand, they 
want to control costs and increase proﬁ ts. Sometimes these two objectives are not compat-
ible; it can be expensive to relocate an executive overseas. A close look at the breakdown of 
international compensation packages helps to make this clear. 
 COMPENSATION 

441
CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
  Common elements in an international compensation package 
 A typical international compensation package includes base salary, beneﬁ ts, and allow-
ances. In addition, most packages address the issue of tax protection and/or tax equaliz-
ation. The following examines these four elements. 
 Base salary 
 Base salary is the amount of cash compensation an individual receives in the home country. 
This salary is typically the benchmark against which bonuses and beneﬁ ts are calculated. 
Survey research reveals that the salaries of expatriates are tied to their home country, so a 
German manager working for a US MNE and assigned to Spain will have a base salary tied 
to the salary structure in Germany. 22  This salary is usually paid in the home currency, local 
currency, or a combination of the two. 
 Salary has become an issue when foreign firms have merged or acquired companies in 
other countries where salaries are significantly higher. For example, when Chrysler and 
Daimler-Benz merged, the Chairman and CEO of Chrysler had a salary of $1.6 million, 
whereas his Daimler-Benz counterpart was earning $1.1 million. 23  Moreover, international 
differences in salaries also create difficulties, as discussed below. 
 Benefits 
 Beneﬁ ts often make up a large portion of the compensation package. There are also a 
number of difﬁ cult issues that typically must be resolved, including how to handle medical 
coverage, what to do about social security, and how to handle the retirement package. Some 
of the speciﬁ c issues that receive a great deal of attention are: 
 1   Whether or not to maintain expatriates in home-country programs, particularly if the 
company does not receive a tax deduction for it. 
 2   Whether companies have the option of enrolling expatriates in host-country benefit 
programs and/or making up any difference in coverage.  
 3  Whether host-country legislation on termination affects benefit entitlements. 
 4   Whether expatriates should receive home-country or host-country social security 
benefits. 
 5   Whether benefits should be maintained on a home-country or host-country basis, who 
is responsible for the cost, whether other benefits should be used to offset any shortfall 
in coverage, and whether home-country benefit programs should be exported to local 
nationals in foreign countries. 
 Most US MNEs include their expatriate managers in the company’s benefit program 
and the cost is no more than it would be back home. In cases in which a foreign govern-
ment also requires contribution to a social security program, the company picks up this 
expense for the employee. Fortunately, in recent years a number of international agree-
ments have been signed that eliminate requirements for dual coverage. 
 MNEs also provide vacations and special leave to expatriates. This often includes 
company-paid air fare back home for the manager and family on an annual basis, as well 
as emergency leave and expense payments in case of death or illness in the family.  
 Allowances 
 Allowances are another major portion of some expatriate compensation packages. One of the 
most common is the   cost-of-living allowance  , which is a payment to compensate for differ-
ences in expenditures between the home country and the foreign location. Designed to provide 
employees with the same standard of living they enjoyed in the home country, this allowance 
can cover a wide variety of areas, including relocation, housing, education, and hardship.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Relocation expenses usually include moving, shipping, and storage charges associated 
with personal goods that the expatriate is taking overseas. Related expenses can include 
perquisites such as cars and club memberships, which are commonly provided to senior-
level managers. 
 Housing allowances cover a wide gamut. Some firms provide managers with a residence 
while overseas and pay all expenses associated with running the house. Other firms provide 
a predetermined amount of money each month, and the managers can make the housing 
choice personally. Some MNEs also help individuals sell their houses back home or rent 
them until their return. The company usually pays expenses associated with these activities. 
Other MNEs such as General Motors encourage their people to retain ownership of their 
homes by paying all rental management fees and reimbursing the employees for up to six 
months’ rent if the house remains unoccupied. 
 Education allowances for an expatriate’s children are an integral part of most com-
pensation packages. These expenses cover such things as tuition, enrollment fees, books, 
supplies, transportation, room, board, and school uniforms. In some cases attendance at 
post-secondary schools is also provided. 
 A  hardship allowance is a special payment made to individuals who are posted to 
areas regarded as less desirable. For example, individuals posted to Eastern Europe, China, 
and some Middle East countries typically receive a hardship premium as an inducement 
to accept the assignment. These payments can be in the form of a lump sum ($10,000 to 
$25,000) or a percentage (15 to 50 percent) of the individual’s base compensation.   
 Taxation 
 MNEs provide tax protection and/or tax equalization for expatriates. For example, a US 
manager sent abroad can end up with two tax bills: one for income earned overseas and the 
other for US taxes on these monies. Section 911 of the US Internal Revenue System code 
permits a deduction of up to $70,000 on foreign-earned income. For some executives, how-
ever, some US taxes might still be due. In handling these situations, most MNEs have a tax 
equalization program under which they withhold an amount equal to the home-country 
tax obligation of the manager and then pay all taxes in the host country. With tax protec-
tion, the employee pays up to the amount of taxes equal to those he or she would pay based 
on compensation in the home country. In this case, the employee is entitled to any differ-
ence if total taxes are less in the foreign country than in the home country. Other MNE tax 
considerations involve state and local tax payments and tax return preparation. 
 The most common approach is for the MNE to determine the base salary and other 
extras (bonuses etc.) the manager would make while living in the home country. The 
taxes on this income are then computed and compared to the total due on the expatriate’s 
income, and the multinational pays any taxes over and above the amount that would have 
been due in the home country.   
  Compensation trends and comparisons 
 In terms of compensation, the MNE’s objective is to ensure that expatriates do not have to 
pay any additional expenses as a result of living abroad.  Figure   14.2    illustrates this idea. The 
income taxes, housing, goods and services, and reserve from the home country are pro-
tected so that the individual’s out-of-pocket expenses remain the same. As we see from the 
ﬁ gure, the overall package can be substantial. This is why there is a trend toward not send-
ing expatriates to overseas positions unless there is a need for their speciﬁ c services. In fact, 
the costs have become so prohibitive that ﬁ rms like Dow Jones & Company, owner of the 
 Wall Street Journal , long ago radically revised its formula for paying allowances for housing, 
goods, and services. 24  In addition, MNEs are increasingly replacing permanent relocation 
and long-term assignments with as-needed short trips that typically last less than a year. 25

CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
 Another trend is the creation of special incentive systems designed to keep expatriates 
motivated. In the process, a growing number of MNEs are now dropping bonuses or 
premiums for overseas assignments and replacing them with lump-sum premiums. This 
approach has a number of benefits. One is that expatriates realize they will be given this 
payment just once—when they move to the international locale. So the payment tends to 
retain its value as an incentive. A second is that the costs to the company are less because 
there is only one payment and no future financial commitment. 
 The specific incentive program used will vary. Researchers have found that some of 
the factors that influence the type and amount of incentive include whether the person is 
moving within or between continents and where the person is being stationed.  Table   14.1    
provides some of the latest survey information related to these incentive practices.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Finally, it is important to realize that many companies are beginning to phase out incen-
tive premiums. Instead, they are focusing on creating a cadre of expats who are motivated 
by non-financial incentives. 
 More companies are starting to take an entirely different approach, paying  no pre-
miums to expatriates regardless of where they send them. According to this philosophy, 
an assignment itself is its own reward. It is an opportunity for an employee to achieve 
personal and career growth. In some organizations, succession planning for senior-level 
positions requires international experience. Others view expatriate assignments as a step 
toward achieving globalization. Companies that subscribe to the philosophy of paying no 
premiums only consider cost-of-living issues, not motivational rewards, when designing 
pay packages. 
 When we step back and compare salaries across countries we get an insight into some 
of the difficulties maintaining parity or equality across groups of managers doing basically 
the same job but in different places. The starkest contrasts appear when we compare CEO 
salaries around the world. The United States stands out in terms of the average remu-
neration for CEOs compared to any other industrialized nation. For example, a group 
of non-US advanced countries (including Japan, most of Western Europe, and Canada) 
averaged only 33 percent of US foreign CEO pay. Over the 1988–2003 period, US foreign 
CEO pay increased by 196 percent, whereas the set of non-US countries only increased by 
129 percent. 26  This has been the source of a significant amount of criticism in the United 
States and beyond. 27 
 What is also interesting in terms of international compensation comparisons is the 
gap between CEO pay levels and workers’ salaries around the world. For a similar 
sample of advanced nations the gap ranges from 10 percent, in Japan at one extreme, to 
45 percent in the United States at the other. Moreover, according to this source this 
is an underestimation of the gap in most of these countries because certain areas of 
compensation are not included in the figures.       28  The variation across national systems 
seems to be symbolic of broader socio-economic and cultural differences between these 
countries. 29  Differences in corporate governance systems, the role of financial incentives, 
and, more fundamentally, differences in the role of corporations in society are reflected 
in these data.  
 One of the major challenges facing MNEs is that of orienting their strategy to meet the 
varying demands of organized labor around the world (see  Figure   14.3   ). National differ-
ences in economic, political, and legal systems create a variety of labor relations systems, 
and the strategy that is effective in one country or region can be of little value in another 
country. 
 In managing labor relations, most MNEs use a combination of centralization and 
decentralization, with some decisions being made at headquarters and others being 
handled by managers on site. 30  Researchers have found that US MNEs tend to exercise 
more centralized control than European MNEs such as the British ones. A number of 
factors have been cited to explain this development: (1) US companies tend to rely 
heavily on formal management controls and a close reporting system is needed to sup-
port this process; (2) European companies tend to deal with labor unions at an indus-
try level, whereas US MNEs deal at the company level; and (3) for many US firms the 
domestic market represents the bulk of their sales (a situation that is not true for many 
European MNEs) and the overseas market is managed as an extension of domestic 
operations. 31  
 LABOR RELATIONS 

445
CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
 Labor relations practices 
 Labor relations practices vary widely. In some countries the economy is strong and unions 
are able to make major demands; in other countries the economy is weak and the unions’ 
ability to bargain is diminished. Similarly, some countries have strong pro-management 
governments whereas others are heavily union oriented. A third factor is the willingness of 
unions to strike or walk out as opposed to continuing to talk with management in the hope 
of resolving differences. Germany and Japan provide some interesting contrasts.       32 
 Germany 
 Labor unions traditionally have been strong in Germany. Although a minority of the labor 
force is organized, unions set the pay scale for about 90 percent of the country’s workers, 
with wages determined by job classiﬁ cations. Union membership is voluntary, but there is 
only one union in each major industry. This union negotiates a contract with the employers’ 
federation for the industry, and the contract covers all major issues, including wages and 
terms of employment. If there is a disagreement over the interpretation or enforcement of 
the contract, the impasse is typically resolved between the company and the worker with the 
participation of a union representative or work council. If this procedure is unsuccessful, 
the matter can then be referred to a German labor court for ﬁ nal settlement.

446
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Despite their power, unions have a much more cooperative relationship with manage-
ment than do their counterparts in the United States. One reason is that workers serve on 
the board of directors and can ensure that the rank and file are treated fairly. 
 Strikes tend to occur after the contract has run out and a new one has yet to be ratified 
by the workers. As in the United States, several agreements may be in force in a particular 
company, and they do not have the same termination dates. So one group of workers may 
be striking or working without a contract while another is working under contract. On occa-
sion, and in violation of the law, there may be strikes in the middle of a contract period, 
but this is rare and union and management typically have a good working relationship. 
However, whether this will continue in the future is difficult to say; the case  International 
Business Strategy in Action: German management and unions examines this issue.  
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 German management and unions 
 During the 1970s and 1980s, German manufacturing 
workers made substantial gains at the bargaining table. 
However, these successes are now coming back to haunt 
both them and their unions. In 1990, the average hourly 
manufacturing cost in the United States was $15 while 
Germany’s was $22. Between 1985 and 1990, manufactur-
ing cost in US dollars in Germany increased by 130 percent 
due to the strength of German currency and a 28 percent 
increase in labor costs in German currency. By 2003, 
average hourly manufacturing cost in Germany was at the 
$29.91 level, mainly as a result of the rising euro. This is 
much higher than in the rest of Western Europe. In Italy it 
is $18, in the UK $20, and in Portugal it is a mere $6.23. In 
the Czech Republic, labor costs in manufacturing are only 
$4.71 per hour. Across the Atlantic, US hourly manufactur-
ing costs average $21.97. 
 In 1999, Volkswagen was prevented from laying off some 
30,000 excess German workers by tough unions and labor 
laws. Job security and high wages are not the only labor 
disadvantages for German firms, which provide shorter 
labor-hour weeks, six weeks of paid vacation, and a very 
generous sick leave plan that promotes absenteeism. As a 
result, German products were having trouble finding inter-
national markets. In response, employers began looking 
for ways to turn things around. 
 In particular, companies began demanding wage con-
cessions and started working to eliminate jobs. IBM’s 
German subsidiary, which had almost 25,000 employees, 
divided itself into five companies, leaving only the 6,000 
workers in the production unit working under a union 
contract. The remainder of the employees were not cov-
ered by the collective agreement, allowing the company 
to increase their work week to 40 hours. Other companies 
began implementing similar strategies, convinced that 
labor leaders would make concessions in order to ensure 
the long-run survival of the business. In particular, man-
agers pointed to the fact that international competition was 
threatening German jobs and, unless productivity could be 
increased, there was a good chance that more and more 
local firms would go out of business. These strategies, 
and a decrease in the exchange rate, have led to real wage 
decreases and a restructuring of the labor market over the 
last few years. 
 A growing number of companies are now winning con-
cessions from their unions. One is CED Informationstechnik 
GmbH, a small firm that assembles personal computers. 
The firm’s union contract allows it to cut back the work-
force when orders are weak. And since CED focuses on 
delivery of computers within 24 hours of receiving an order, 
it has no need to build inventory. Thus, the workforce size is 
tied directly to the amount of orders on hand, allowing CED

CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
 Japan 
 In Japan, union–management relationships are extremely cooperative. Social custom dic-
tates non-confrontational behavior. So although labor agreements are often general and 
vague, disputes over interpretations tend to be settled amicably. Sometimes it is necessary to 
bring in third-party mediators or arbitrators, but there are no prolonged, acrimonious dis-
putes that end up in a plant being closed down because the two sides cannot work together. 
Typically, a strike is used merely to embarrass the management and seldom lasts longer than 
one week. Although it is possible to resort to legal action in resolving strikes, this is typically 
frowned upon by both labor and management, and both sides try to stay away from using 
this means of bringing about solutions to their problems. 
 Japanese unions are most active during the spring and at the end of the year, the two 
periods during which bonuses are negotiated. However, these activities do not usually end 
up in a union–management conflict. If there is a strike, it is more likely at a time when a 
Japanese union is negotiating with management during industry-wide negotiations. Even 
here, the objective is to show that the workers are supportive of the union and not to 
indicate a grievance or complaint with management. In overall terms, Japanese workers 
tend to subordinate their interests and identities to those of the group. This cultural value 
helps account for a great deal of the harmony that exists between labor and management.       33 
to operate with a basic crew of only 200 people. In turn, 
another group of approximately 40 workers has contracts 
guaranteeing them at least 1,000 hours of work annually, 
so these people can count on approximately 20 hours a 
week on average—although this is all tied to work orders. 
The remaining 300 employees at CED work as needed and 
can find after a month or two of large orders that things dry 
up and they have no work for the next couple of months. It 
is a chance they have to take.  
 An 8.5 percent and 18.5 percent unemployment rate 
in West and East Germany, respectively, and the relo-
cation of operations outside Germany by both domestic 
and foreign companies have increased the pressure on 
unions to accept less favorable contracts. While all of 
this is a big change from the days when the unions used 
to dictate terms, it is one that is accepted by both the 
workers and the CED’s worker council. This attitude is 
reflective of a growing number of unions. In 1999, when 
Wacker-Chemie workers were in danger of losing their 
jobs because the company was losing millions of dollars, 
the union proactively allowed the adjustment of wages 
and an adjustment in workers’ hours. As a result, jobs 
were saved and Wacker-Chemie was allowed to get back 
on its feet. Thanks to compromise on the part of its union, 
management in the chemical sector can, upon consul tation 
with workers, decrease wages by up to 10 percent per 
year, eliminate Christmas bonuses, and adjust the hours 
of work. In 2000, workers at Philipp Holzmann, a construc-
tion firm undergoing problems, bargained a wage decrease 
with the condition that workers will share the company’s 
future gains. This new-found flexibility offers the promise 
of making German industry more competitive than it has 
been in a long time. 
 Indeed, during the economic crisis, Germany export 
rose 18.5 percent in 2010. In March 2011, German exports 
totaled €98.3bn ($142bn; £87bn), almost 16 percent higher 
than the same month in 2010. This figure was the highest 
monthly total since data started to be compiled in 1950. 
One difference was that Germany has embraced reforms. 
At the same, German companies made changes — but 
without the big bang of deregulation. The country embraced 
labor market reforms, but in a measured way. It is now 
easier to hire and fire. Companies have also taken advan-
tage of the pool of workers in the east of the country (after 
the full opening of the German labour market on May 1, 
2011). Volkswagen and BMW, for example, have found it 
easy to move production to lower cost eastern sites around 
Leipzig. Unions now recognize that the quid pro quo for 
government help in the recession is some restraint on pay. 
BMW is hiring another 2,000 workers; BASF, the world’s 
biggest chemical company, reported a 40 percent jump 
in earnings; Siemens, Europe’s biggest engineering com-
pany, said profits would nearly double in 2011. Bosch has 
post-recession sales at a record of €47bn.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Industrial democracy 
 Unlike the United States, many countries have   industrial democracy  , which is the legally 
mandated right of employees to participate in signiﬁ cant management decisions. This 
authority extends into areas such as wages, bonuses, proﬁ t sharing, work rules, dismissals, 
and plant expansions and closings. Industrial democracy can take a number of different 
forms. 
  Forms of industrial democracy 
 At present there are a number of forms of industrial democracy. In some countries one 
form may be more prevalent than others, and it is common to ﬁ nd some of these forms 
existing simultaneously. The following describes three of the most popular forms. 
 Codetermination 
 Codetermination   is a legal system that requires workers and their managers to discuss major 
strategic decisions before companies implement them. It has brought about worker partici-
pation on boards of directors and is quite popular in Europe, where Austria, Denmark, the 
Netherlands, and Sweden have legally mandated codetermination. In many cases the workers 
hold one-third of the seats on the board, although it is 50 percent in private German 
companies with 2,000 or more employees. On the negative side, some researchers report 
that many workers are unimpressed with codetermination and feel that it does not provide 
sufﬁ cient worker input to major decisions.   
 Work councils 
 Work councils   are groups that consist of both worker and manager representatives and 
are charged with dealing with such matters as improving company performance, work-
ing conditions, and job security. In some ﬁ rms these councils are worker or union run, 
whereas in others a management representative chairs the group. The councils are a result 
of either national legislation or collective bargaining at the company–union level, and they 
exist throughout Europe. However, their power varies. In Germany, the Netherlands, and 
Italy, work councils are more powerful than they are in the UK, France, and Scandinavia.   
 Shop floor participation 
 Shop ﬂ oor participation takes many forms, including job enrichment programs, quality 
 circles, and various other versions of participative management. These approaches give 
workers an opportunity to make their voices heard and play a role in identifying and resolving 
problems. Shop ﬂ oor participation is widely used in Scandinavian countries and has spread 
to other European nations and the United States over the last two decades. 
  Industrial democracy in action 
 Industrial democracy can be found in different forms throughout the United States, Europe, 
and Asia. The following discussion examines three examples. 34 
 Germany 
 Industrial democracy and codetermination are both very strong in Germany, especially in 
the steel and auto industries. Private ﬁ rms with 2,000 or more employees (in the steel indus-
try it is 1,000 employees) must have supervisory boards (similar to a board of directors in 
the United States) composed of workers as well as managers. There must also be a manage-
ment board responsible for daily operations to which company employees elect members. 
 Researchers have found that codetermination works well in Germany. Some critics have 
argued that too many people are involved in the decision-making process, which slows

things down, resulting in inefficiencies. However, Scholl reports that a study he conducted 
of both managers and work councils found no such problems.       35 
 Denmark 
 Industrial democracy in Denmark gives workers the right to participate in management on 
both a direct and an indirect basis. The direct form maintains that employees are members 
of semi-autonomous work groups that provide ideas on how to enhance productivity and 
quality and schedule work. In the indirect form, shop stewards on the ﬂ oor represent fel-
low workers on the board of directors, and on cooperation committees that consist of both 
management and worker representatives. Industrial democracy works exceptionally well in 
Denmark, where researchers have found that cooperation committees contribute substan-
tially to openness, coordination of effort, and a feeling of importance on the part of workers.       36 
 Japan 
 Japan’s use of industrial democracy concepts is not tied to political philosophy as in Europe; 
rather, it is oriented more to Japanese culture and the belief in group harmony. Moreover, 
Japanese industrial democracy is not as extensive as that in the West. Japanese workers are 
encouraged to identify and to solve job-related problems associated with quality and the 
ﬂ ow of work. Management in turn is particularly receptive to worker ideas that will pro-
duce bottom-line results. This process is carried out in a paternalistic setting in which the 
company looks after the employees and the latter respond appropriately. 
 Unions play virtually no role in promoting industrial democracy or participative 
management because they are weak and, in many cases, only ceremonial. One group of 
researchers put it this way: 
  In truth, most workers think of themselves as company employees who are simply associated with 
the union. Moreover, it is not uncommon to find a union strike in a company with two or three 
work shifts and no loss of work output. This is because, when the strikers are done picketing or 
marching, they then go to work and the group coming out of the factory takes up the strike activ-
ity. In a factory with three shifts, a line employee will work a full shift, picket for a while, go home 
to eat and sleep, and then return to the factory for her or his shift.       37 
 As a result, Japanese MNEs face the greatest challenge from industrial democracy 
because they are least accustomed to using the idea. On the other hand, as Japanese firms 
continue to expand into Europe and the United States, there will likely be a growing use of 
authority-sharing concepts such as codetermination, work councils, and other approaches 
that are becoming so common in Western firms. 
 A number of HRM strategies are currently receiving attention from MNEs.       38  There are too 
many to address here, but four that do warrant consideration are language training, cultural 
adaptation, competitive compensation, and specially designed HRM programs. 
 Language training 
 English is the primary language of international business. However, training in the 
host-country language can be particularly useful because it allows managers to interact 
more effectively with their local colleagues and workers and communicate more directly 
with suppliers and customers. Another advantage is that the training allows the man-
ager to monitor the competition more effectively. For example, in recent years a growing 
number of US MNEs have set up operations in Japan, including DuPont, Eastman Kodak, 
 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND IHRM 
STRATEGIES 

450
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Procter & Gamble, and Rockwell International. Many of these 
MNEs’ expatriate managers and R&D personnel have been given language training, which 
has paid off handsomely. For example, when Rockwell International entered into nego-
tiations with a Japanese ﬁ rm over royalties on a patent it holds on advanced semiconductor 
processing technology, the Japanese company said it had no intention of using Rockwell’s 
 patent. However, the company negotiators were able to show the Japanese an article from a 
Japanese newspaper in which their company had boasted about using the new technology. 
As a result, Rockwell now receives royalties on the use of this technology by the Japanese 
company. 39  In fact, thanks to language training, Rockwell was able to discover a host of 
 patent infringements on the same technology by other Japanese ﬁ rms. 
 Language training is useful in recruiting local talent and developing good relations with 
local organizations. IBM Japan, for example, hires 30 percent of its research scientists from 
Japanese universities or companies. Other US firms follow a similar pattern, offering large 
salaries ($150,000 and up) to attract senior Japanese scientists who can help create new 
high-tech products. Language training also comes in handy in developing and sustain-
ing relationships with universities and government agencies. In fact, Dow Chemical has 
 created a team for just this purpose. 
 Another benefit of language training is the ability to monitor competition. MNEs often 
locate near their major competitors because new developments by these firms are most likely 
to be reported in local newspapers and other sources. It is often possible to learn more about 
what a competitor is doing through local news media than one could ever find out from an 
investigation conducted by MNE headquarters. Many foreign MNEs have personnel who are 
fluent in English, peruse the  Wall Street Journal ,  New York Times , and US industry publi-
cations on a daily basis, then compile a thick folder on the strategies of their US competitors. 
 Language training is also useful in helping to learn about a country’s culture and to interact 
socially with the people. Research reports that most US expatriate managers give little impor-
tance to the value of a second language. In contrast, executives from South America, Europe, 
and Japan place a high priority on speaking more than one language. Fortunately, universities 
in the United States are now stepping in to help. For example, the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and other institutions of higher learning now offer courses in how to read techni-
cal Japanese and understand the Japanese research culture; this educational focus is likely to 
expand to other countries in the future. For the moment, however, language training con-
tinues to be a weak link in the development of an effective IHRM strategy for many MNEs.

How useful is it for Coca-Cola’s managers to be fluent in more than one 
language? Why? 
 Coca-Cola’s managers must be fluent in other languages because the company believes 
this allows them to operate effectively in at least two different cultures. This permits 
the company to transfer managers from one geographic region to another and to know 
that the managers will be able to become acculturated within a minimum time period. 
Moreover, because there are common languages in many regions of the world, a manager 
who is fluent, say, in English and Spanish could be transferred to countries throughout 
North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Australia. Thus, bilingualism provides 
the company with a cadre of managers who can literally span the globe.   

451
CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
 Cultural adaptation 
 Closely tied to language training is the need for managers to understand the culture of the 
country to which they are assigned. The importance of culture was discussed in  Chapter 5 , 
where it was noted that major differences exist between cultural clusters. In preparing man-
agers for overseas positions, MNEs are now using three basic approaches. The simplest and 
least expensive is to design a program that provides cultural orientation by familiarizing 
individuals with the country’s cultural institutions and value systems. This is often done 
through a formal training program and/or meetings with company personnel who have 
just returned from a posting in that country. The second is to provide individuals with lan-
guage training and, if time and money permit, allow them to visit the country. Some MNEs 
tie this approach to a manager’s assignment by setting aside the ﬁ rst couple of weeks on site 
for orientation and acculturation. A third approach that is fairly expensive but has received 
high marks for its value is the use of cultural assimilators. 
 Cultural assimilators 
 A  cultural assimilator   is a programmed learning technique designed to expose members 
of one culture to some of the basic concepts, attitudes, role perceptions, customs, and val-
ues of another. Cultural assimilators are developed for pairs of cultures, such as familiariz-
ing managers from the United States with the culture in Germany. Of course, an assimilator 
can be developed for expatriates who are assigned to any culture in the world, and the 
approach almost always takes the same format: the person being trained is asked to read a 
short episode of a cultural encounter and then choose an interpretation of what has hap-
pened and why. If the response is correct, the individual goes on to the next episode. If not, 
he or she is asked to reread the episode and then make another choice.  Table   14.2    provides 
an illustration. 
 Cultural assimilators use critical incidents as the basis for training. These incidents are 
typically ones in which (1) the expatriate will be interacting with a host nation, (2) the situ-
ation may be misinterpreted or mishandled if the expatriate is not properly trained, and 
(3) the event is relevant to the expatriate’s task or mission requirements.       40  The incidents are 
provided by expatriates who have served in this particular country, as well as by members of 
the host nation. Once they are written, they are tested on people who have had experience in 
the country in order to ensure that the responses are realistic and that one choice is indeed 
preferable to the others. Typically, 150 to 200 incidents are developed and the list is pruned 
to 75 to 100 incidents, which are eventually included in the assimilator booklet. 
 Assimilators can be expensive to create. The typical cost for developing one is approxi-
mately $50,000. However, for MNEs that are continually sending people to a particular 
overseas location, the cost can be spread over many trainees and the assimilator can remain 
intact for a number of years. A $50,000 assimilator that is used with 500 people over a five-
year period costs the company only $100 per person, and the cost of revising the program 
is often quite small, so over the long run the assimilators can be very cost effective.   
 Competitive compensation 
 MNEs are also beginning to evaluate more carefully the cost of sending people overseas as 
well as to review the expense of maintaining executive talent in the international arena. The 
ﬁ rst of these concerns focuses on all expatriates. The second addresses top-level managers 
only. 
 Compensation costs vary widely because goods and services in some countries are 
sharply higher (or lower) than in others. For example, food, clothes, and entertainment 
in the United States are fairly inexpensive compared to Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or the

UK (see  Table   14.3   ). In particular, the cost-of-living allowance for managers in Europe 
and Japan adds significantly to the MNE’s overhead. For this reason, major MNEs, from 
General Motors to IBM to TRW, are looking for ways to recruit and develop local talent to 
staff operations and thus reduce their reliance on expatriates. 
 The other major area of compensation that is receiving increased attention is that of 
hiring and retaining top management talent. Research shows that the cost of hiring senior-
level managers is extremely high, and in most cases these individuals received a substantial 
salary raise when they moved into their new position. Moreover, as the demand for tal-
ented executives rises, the salaries of international managers will continue to rise. This is 
one reason why many MNEs are now hiring people for specific locations and leaving them 
 Table 14.2  A cultural assimilator situation 
 Sharon Hatfield, a schoolteacher in Athens, was amazed at the questions that were asked of her by Greeks whom she 
considered to be only casual acquaintances. When she entered or left her apartment, people would ask her where she was 
going or where she had been. If she stopped to talk, she was asked questions like, “How much do you make a month?” She 
thought the Greeks were very rude.

 Why did the Greeks ask Sharon such “personal” questions?

 You selected 1:  The casual acquaintances were acting like friends do in Greece, although Sharon did not realize it. 
 Correct.  It is not improper for in-group members to ask these questions of one another. Furthermore, these questions 
reflect the fact that friendships (even “casual” ones) tend to be more intimate in Greece than in the United States. As a 
result, friends are generally free to ask questions that would seem too personal in the United States.

 You selected 2:  The Greeks asked Sharon the questions in order to determine whether she belonged to the Greek Orthodox

 No.  This is not why the Greeks asked Sharon such questions. Remember, whether or not some information is “personal” 
depends on the culture. In this case the Greeks did not consider these questions too “personal.” Why? Try again.

 No.  There was no information given to lead you to believe that the Greeks were unhappy with Sharon’s way of living. The 
episode states that the Greeks were acquaintances of Sharon.

 No.  Such questions are indeed proper under certain situations. However, sex has nothing to do with it. When are these 
questions proper? Try to apply what you have learned about proper behavior between friends in Greece. Was Sharon 
regarded as a friend by these Greeks?

CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
in place for extended periods of time. This strategy is less costly than continually moving 
managers from one geographic location to another. 
 HRM strategy will become an increasingly important part of the overall MNE strategic 
plan. Rising compensation costs are one of the major reasons for this trend.  
  Specially designed HRM programs 
 Another emerging trend is specially designed HRM programs. In recent years a growing 
number of MNEs have begun to realize that HRM practices have to be tailor-made. This 
has been clearly illustrated by Sparrow and Budhwar, who compared data from 13 different 
countries on the basis of HRM factors. Five of these factors included the following: 
 1   Structural empowerment characterized by flat organization designs, wide spans of 
control, the use of flexible cross-functional teams, and the rewarding of individuals for 
productivity gains. 
 2   Accelerated resource development characterized by the early identification of high-
potential employees, the establishment of both multiple and parallel career paths, the 
rewarding of personnel for enhancing their skills and knowledge, and the offering of 
continuous training and development education. 
 3   Employee welfare emphasis characterized by firms offering personal family assistance, 
encouraging and regarding external volunteer activities, and promoting a culture that 
emphasizes equality in the workplace.  
 4   An efficiency emphasis in which employees are encouraged to monitor their own work 
and continually improve their performance. 
 5   An emphasis on long-term results such as innovation and creativity rather than just 
weekly and monthly short-term productivity. 41 
 When Sparrow and Budhwar used these HRM approaches on a comparative country-
by-country basis, they found worldwide differences in HRM practices.  Table  14.4 shows 
the comparative results, after each of the 13 countries was categorized as being either high 
or low on the respective factors. 
 These findings reveal that countries are unique in their approach to HRM. What works 
well in the United States may have limited value in France. In fact, a close analysis of 
 Table   14.4    shows that none of the 13 countries had the same profile, each was different. 
This was even true in the case of Anglophone nations such as the United States, Canada, 
Australia, and the UK, where differences in employee welfare emphasis, accelerated resource 
development, long efficiency orientation, and long-term vision resulted in unique HRM

profiles for each. Similarly, Japan and Korea differed on two of the factors, as did Germany 
and France; India, which many people might feel would be more similar to an Anglophone 
culture than to an Asian one, differed on two of the factors with both the United States and 
the UK, three of the factors with Canada, and all four factors with Australia. 
 These findings point to the fact that MNEs in the future will have to focus increasingly 
on HRM programs designed to meet the needs of local personnel. A good example is pro-
vided in Eastern Europe, where international managers are discovering that in order to 
effectively recruit college graduates their firms must provide training programs that give 
these new employees opportunities to work with a variety of tasks and help them specialize 
in their particular fields of interest. At the same time, the MNEs are discovering that these 
recruits are looking for companies that offer a good social working environment. A survey 
of more than 1,000 business and engineering students from Poland, the Czech Republic, 
and Hungary found that almost two-thirds of the respondents said they wanted their boss 
to be receptive to their ideas, 37 percent were looking for managers who had strong indus-
try experience, and 34 percent wanted a boss who was a good rational decision maker. 
These findings indicate that multinational HRM is now becoming much more of a two-way 
street: both employees and managers need to adjust continually to emerging demands. 42

 1   International human resource management (IHRM) is the process of selecting, training, 
developing, and compensating personnel in overseas positions. IHRM strategies involve 
consideration of staffing, selecting, training, compensating, and labor relations in the 
international environment. 
 2   A number of screening criteria are used in choosing people for international assign-
ments. These include adaptability, self-reliance, age, experience, education, health, 
family status, motivation, and leadership. The most common selection procedure is the 
interview, although some firms also use testing. In recent years MNEs have also begun 
formulating repatriation strategies for integrating returning managers back into the 
workplace at home.  
 KEY POINTS 

455
CHAPTER 14 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
 3   Training and development programs are another key part of IHRM strategies. There 
are a wide variety of these programs, ranging from environmental briefings to language 
training. 
 4   There are a number of common parts in a typical international compensation package, 
including base salary, benefits, allowances, and tax protection and/or equalization. In 
essence, the package’s objective is to ensure that the expatriate does not have to pay any 
additional expenses as a result of living abroad.  
 5   Labor relations practices vary widely in the international arena. For example, union–
management relations and industrial democracy approaches are different throughout 
Europe, and these differ dramatically from those in Japan.  
 6   A number of HRM strategies are currently receiving a great deal of attention from 
MNEs. Three of these are language training, cultural adaptation, and competitive 
compensation.

 REAL CASE 
 When outsourcing crosses national borders it is called off-
shoring, but over the last few years, British trade unions and 
US politicians have been campaigning to stop offshoring—
at a time when a growing number of firms, including Lloyds 
TSB, HSBC, Abbey, IBM, and JP Morgan, are using India’s 
service professionals. In the mid-2000s, India’s high-tech 
sector was growing at 30 percent per year and the volume 
of outsourcing contracts at 50 percent per year. IT sector 
exports were $12 billion in 2004 and rose to $32 billion by 
2007. 
 The growth of the Indian IT sector is surprising because 
it lacked the domestic factors typically associated with the 
development of a competitive industry. First, local demand 
for software was non-existent. Second, related and sup-
porting industries such as telecoms or computing were 
highly underdeveloped. Third, the national communication 
infrastructure was among the worst in the world. Fourth, 
despite India’s relatively higher level of education in relation 
to other countries, it was nowhere near the level of the triad 
countries. Finally, financial capital was in short supply. 
 Clearly, some general conditions help account for the time 
of the growth period, not least the global shortage of soft-
ware programming skills relative to demand. The imbalance 
between supply and demand pushed up the price of software 
skills, globally increasing the cheap labor advantage held 
by Indian firms. This, coupled with strong English language 
skills, made Indian programmers good substitutes for more 
expensive Western programmers. Software engineers tech-
nically trained in the United States and Europe had devel-
oped customer links to the major customer firms (banks, 
telecoms, IT companies, and so on) in the West and then 
returned to India to establish their own ventures. New tech-
nologies enabled Indian firms to service the needs of over-
seas customers via satellite and the Internet. Transportation 
costs are insignificant and the geographic time difference 
can be an asset, allowing Indian firms to work through the 
“Western night.” Finally, the Indian government had identi-
fied software as an area of potential growth in the 1970s and 
supported it through the 1990s, when the industry began to 
explode. Another important factor has been the willingness 
of computer firms, such as Computer Associates, to invest 
in the Indian market. 
 In the United States, fears of job losses are forcing poli-
ticians to take a stand. A US government regulation now pro-
hibits the offshoring of government services. This, however, 
has little effect on India’s industry, which has traditionally 
relied on private contracts. Supporters of outsourcing argue 
that it is beneficial to customers who can now pay less for 
services and that the rise in wealth in India would increase 
bilateral trade, creating opportunities for US firms. Indeed, 
a recent study by McKinsey estimates that for every dol-
lar of US outsourcing, 78 cents are value created in the 
United States and only 22 cents are retained by the foreign 
country. The British government is taking a different stand 
than the US government and it is offshoring to India the IT 
systems for the National Health Service. It is no longer just 
IT jobs. Offshoring of accountant services, medical services, 
research, and data entry to India is also growing. 
 Offshoring does not always run smoothly. In the case of 
call centers, despite employee training in different English 
 Offshoring to India

accents, customers have complained of problems com-
municating. In addition, the cultures might clash. On the 
other hand, many argue that Indian workers are more pro-
fessional and better educated than their Western counter-
parts. The industry might be attracting a disproportionate 
number of bright minds in India because of the relatively 
higher standard of living enjoyed by those in the industry. 
 Today, Indian IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, 
Infosys Technology, Wipro Technologies, and Satyam 
Computer Services are diversifying their portfolios and 
increasingly relying on e-commerce and other Internet-
related businesses to cushion themselves against changes 
in the outsourcing market. Four factors drive this diversifi-
cation: political risk from protectionists, rising wages, the 
rising value of the rupee, and growing competition from 
other nations such as China and Russia.

 1 Porter’s well-known 1990 study on the competitive 
advantage of nations describes factors that have 
promoted high rates of innovation in certain 
industries in certain countries. These are 
summarized as the Porter Diamond framework 
showing how factor conditions, related and 
supporting industries, demand conditions, and the 
strategy, structure, and rivalry of other local firms 
can force continual improvements in productivity 
and new product development. How does the 
development of Indian IT fit into this framework?   
 2 What are the threats and opportunities for Western 
software firms arising from this shift in the 
competitive landscape? How are they strategically 
responding to these?   
 3 What factors must a firm considering outsourcing 
take into account? 
 Executive search firms 
 Commonly known as headhunters, executive search firms 
(ESFs) are a specialized branch of management consulting 
that work directly with clients, usually MNEs, to identify, 
evaluate, and recruit senior executives. Most  Fortune 1,000 
companies use ESFs to fill positions ranging from entry-
level to CEO and board member. Worldwide ESFs are an 
$18 billion industry. Their fees are a percentage of the 
salary (including equity) the chosen candidate will receive 
in the first year of employment, which creates the right 
incentives for bargaining for high salaries by their execu-
tives. The largest firms are shown in Table 1. These firms 
are highly competitive, particularly in North America and 
Europe. There are also many small local boutique firms, 
but these often work with the major international chains 
for MNE recruiting.    
 After several years of dot.com-driven prosperity, 
the slowdown of the world economy hit the ESFs hard. 
Between 1998 and 2000, the industry had enjoyed a boom 
with annual growth of over 20 percent. In the United States, 
growth was even higher at 31 percent in 2000. By the first 
few years of the new century, however, the crash of the 
IT industry and the US recession reduced the number of 
executive spots and put a freeze on new hiring for many 
positions. Between 2000 and 2003, almost all ESFs were 
reporting losses and many headhunters were looking 
for work themselves. By 2004, things had started to turn 
around for ESFs, especially in financial services, real 
estate, security, and construction, which once again began 
to hire. Since then business has picked up once again: 2006 
saw a 9 percent increase in searches and a 13 percent 
increase in revenues for ESFs. 
 To offset the strong dependence on the business cycle, 
ESFs are increasingly diversifying. Korn/Ferry and Heidrick 
& Struggles now offer strategic management assess-
ments and executive development services. A third of Egon 
Zehnder International’s revenues come from non-search 
work. The company has become a consultant for private 
investors who want to evaluate a firm’s quality of man-
agement. Like its competitors, it has entered the human 
resource development business by providing mid-sized 
MNEs with an assessment team. It now has 283 consult-
ants serving client needs from 58 offices worldwide. 
Diversification has allowed these companies to reduce 
reliance on executive searches as a line of business;

branching into consulting, however, is unlikely to provide 
much respite for ESFs since consulting firms face similar 
challenges. 
 Alongside some degree of diversification ESFs have 
significantly internationalized in recent years (as shown in 
 Table   2   ), following the relocation of clients and the growth 
of executive search services outside the Triad regions. 
 Korn Ferry, for example, has 500 consultants in 80 offices 
in 39 countries and has expanded its presence in China and 
India considerably over the past few years. Research by 
Faulconbridge et al. (2007) has shown how the industry has 
evolved through several stages: organic growth after the 
1960s, M&A from the late 1970s, and the development of a 
variety of alliance networks more recently. This expansion 
path has given rise to several distinctive organizational 
forms: the wholly owned multinational, such as Heidrick & 
Struggles International, Spencer Stuart, and Egon Zehnder 
International; the networked transnational, such as the 
Globe Search Group; and hybrid organizations, such as 
Korn Ferry, which adopt either, depending on the market 
context or client needs.   
 But analysis of the figures in Executive Grapevine in 
2010, an annual report on headhunting, suggests that 
some parts of the industry face pressure from business 
networking websites such as LinkedIn, which completed

a successful initial public offering in May, 2011. More 
significant is the way that companies are using business 
networking websites to negotiate better rates for external 
searches. The report indicates that employers no longer 
need headhunters to put names on a shortlist. They need 
them to do the selling, to persuade people to move. At the 
top levels people are still not used to social networks. They 
tend to be older and once they step outside certain sectors, 
like technology, the social networks have not really had 
an impact. Headhunters themselves are divided over the

impact of business networking websites. Some believe it 
can be useful in executive searches. Historically, it might 
have taken 10 days or so to find a particular person who 
had disappeared off the radar. Now it takes you 20 seconds. 
Some do not believe it will replace executive search firms 
any time soon. Even so, some practitioners believe that 
the continued growth of networking websites may force 
headhunters out of the market at the lower end of their 
current business model, because they will make it hard for 
search firms to raise fee levels even when general market 
conditions improve. This would leave the headhunters even 
more heavily exposed to the fortunes of the high earners 
in the financial sector, for example in the UK than they are 
already.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 For international managers different countries represent different 
business contexts with new sources of opportunity and risk. Political 
change, whether gradual or sudden, can be a source of both, and 
tends to be a particularly important factor in emerging and developing 
countries. Changes in institutions, governance systems, and business-
related legislation are frequent in such countries and can radically 
change the local “rules of the game.” An important management 
priority is to fully assess the risks as well as the potential rewards 
before and after investing in these kinds of new markets. Major political 
changes in China and India in the early 1990s, for example, opened up 
these economies for foreign investors. They had always been attractive 
markets, but were made accessible by government-led liberalization. 
However, the high level of control still held by these governments over 
their economies, combined with the continued uncertainty regarding 
political change, results in a high level of political risk for investors. 
 Beyond these major political shifts, smaller changes in any government’s 
policies toward foreign investors—from taxes and tariffs to profit 
repatriation to local input content to employment legislation to corporate 
governance practices—can tilt the balance between profit and loss. 
 This chapter examines political risk in the context of overall country 
risk assessment. We look at how multinational enterprises (MNEs) 
try to forecast this risk, how they can understand governments’ policy 
agendas, and how they can use negotiating tactics to minimize their 
political risk. 
     The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  the nature of political risk.  
 2  Understand  how to apply some of the tools and resources that 
companies can use to measure and forecast political risk.  
 3  Discuss  some of the ways that firms manage risk.  
 4  Review  typical strategies and tactics used in negotiating 
agreements.

CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
  Fewer than one Chinese household in ten owns a camera today. 
And that camera exposes about four rolls of film each year. If 
only half the people in China shot a single 36-exposure roll 
of film a year—a fraction of usage rates in other countries— 
that would swell the number of worldwide “clicks” by 25%. 
Each second, 500 more photos would be taken. That’s the 
equivalent of adding another U.S. or Japan to the world photo-
graphic market. China offers more potential for photography 
than any other market in the world.  
 George Fisher (Kodak CEO), May 23, 1998 
 (Kodak press release at:  http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/
pressReleases/pr19980323-01.shtml ) 
 In 1997 Kodak faced growing competition in its domestic 
US market and was struggling with the impending techno-
logical and market shift toward digital imaging, away from 
its traditional stronghold in film-based products. It was 
also losing a long-running battle with regulatory author-
ities in Japan, challenging what it saw as anti-competitive 
practices that protected its key rival Fuji’s hold on its own 
domestic market. At this time it had a limited presence of 
600 people in the fastest-growing market, China, import-
ing, distributing, and selling film worth $250 million. It 
was competing head-to-head with Fuji and local manufac-
turers, but falling behind; Fuji had the greater market share. 
 The options open to foreign investors in China then were 
far more restrictive than they are today. Outside-in M&As 
or even majority foreign-owned joint ventures were not 
allowed under highly protective government regulations. 
Kodak needed more than a change of strategy; it needed 
a change in the local “rules of the game.” Kodak’s overall 
aims were for exclusive rights to produce and sell locally 
(shut out rivals); to establish distribution, retailing, and 
marketing operations to tap into the growing consumer 
market in China; to establish production facilities for China 
and the South-East Asian region; and to use a combination 
of M&A and joint ventures to tap into local film business 
knowledge and resources. 
 Surprisingly, it achieved all of these objectives. Under 
the direction of CEO George Fisher, who had led Motorola’s 
developments in China, the firm engineered what is now 
considered to be a very successful series of M&As and joint 
ventures. These resulted in an investment of $1.2 billion 
and a massive expansion in local production, sales, and 
marketing operations. 
 The key was an agreement with the Chinese government 
orchestrated from the very top, between Fisher and Prime 
 Kodak in China: changing the rules of the game 
 ACTIVE LEARNING CASE 
Minister Zhu Rongji. This gave Kodak exclusive rights to 
the local market by placing a moratorium on other foreign 
investment in the industry (blocking Fuji and Agfa) and 
forcing all but one of the existing Chinese competitors 
to close or be acquired. Kodak was allowed to purchase 
majority control of three local film companies in Xiamen, 
Shantou, and Wuxi. Two of these had supplier relation-
ships with Fuji, which were severed, leaving Fuji to rely on 
a Hong Kong company, China–Hong Kong Photo Products 
Holdings, to distribute its products on the mainland. Three 
other failing local film companies were forced to close.  
 The two companies formed under Chinese company law, 
Kodak (China) and Kodak (Wuxi) in  Figure  15.1 , are Kodak-
controlled Chinese companies. The government agree-
ment allowed Kodak a greater proportion of ownership and 
more management control than any other foreign company 
had ever been granted in China up to that point. It gained a 
70 percent share in Kodak (Wuxi), which manufactures and 
sells chemical products for photographic processing, and 
an 80 percent share of Kodak (China), which manufactures 
film and paper. The corporate structure adopted (a limited-
liability shares company) represented a radical departure 
from traditional equity joint-venture structures allowed 
previously by the Chinese authorities. This was helped by a 
key change in the mid-1990s whereby some foreign com-
panies were allowed to establish foreign investor share-
holding corporations (FISCs) for the first time.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Kodak introduced a new system of management control, 
topped by a Kodak-controlled board of directors. Shantou 
Era and Xiamen Fuda were limited to the appointment of 
one director each to Kodak (China) Company’s 10-person 
board. Key objectives were to introduce best-in-class man-
agement practices and processes, invest in local training 
programs, create a performance-based culture, and estab-
lish core Kodak values with local characteristics. 
 The overall investment has paid off for Kodak. It now 
controls most of the indigenous Chinese photo film indus-
try and has a market share of around 60 percent, from 
40 percent in 1998. The only remaining local competitor is 
the aptly named Lucky Film Corporation, which has about 
20 percent of the market and with which Kodak signed 
a $100 million 20-year cooperative agreement in 2003 
(selling its stake in 2008). In the same year China became 
Kodak’s largest market in the world for cameras when it 
sold over 1 million. It has continued to invest in manufac-
turing operations in China while also pursuing its global 
digital strategy in the growing domestic market. 
 Although the relationship between Fisher and Zhu Rongji 
set the all-important tone for the negotiations, the so-called 
Grand Plan was a massive initiative stretching over several 
years. It involved seven state-owned enterprises, six provin-
cial governments, ten city governments, five ministries and 
commissions, local tax authorities, and several banks and 
trust companies. All of this was under the umbrella of the 
Central Coordinating Committee designated by the Chinese 
government. The critical key, though, was Zhu Rongji’s 
broader, long-term ambitions for the liberalization of the 
Chinese economy and his immensely powerful position at 
the pinnacle of a steep, complex government hierarchy. 
 Foreign funds and employment were major attractions for 
the Chinese side. Shantou Era Photo Materials and Xiamen 
Fuda Photographic Materials (with 2,000 employees) were 
in debt to the tune of $843 million prior to the takeover. 
According to the  People’s Daily  newspaper (August 1999), 
the tax paid by the Xiamen joint cooperative venture after 
it went into operation last year alone surpassed the total 
taxes paid by the old factory over the previous 14 years. 
Kodak also donated funds to com munity initiatives includ-
ing the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center in Pudong and 
Project Hope School under China Youth Development Fund 
and established scholarship programs with five top univer-
sities in China. These benefits came alongside the direct 
and indirect employment created by the new ventures 
and the inflows of technology and expertise from Kodak. 
In retrospect we can now see that Kodak’s expertise and 
technology were quickly becoming redundant. Despite its 
initial success in China, Kodak failed to adapt to the new 
realities of digital photography and in January 2012 it filed 
for bankruptcy in the US courts.

  What are the lessons for other firms looking to enter emerging markets like China? 
 A range of strategy frameworks in this book—such as the strategy matrix, Porter’s value 
chain, competitor analysis, or Porter’s ﬁ ve forces—help managers understand their com-
petitive environment and identify their ﬁ rm’s unique competitive advantages. Country risk 
analysis can build on these approaches by providing insights into the country-level factors 
that will affect the leveraging of these advantages in a particular country, and help managers 
balance potential risks against rewards.   Country risk analysis   examines the chances of non-
market events (political, social, and economic) causing ﬁ nancial, strategic, or personnel losses 
to a ﬁ rm following FDI in a speciﬁ c country market. Rather than looking at market, industry, 
or group of competitors, country risk analysis tries to predict macroeconomic and political 
sources of change that might undermine a ﬁ rm’s position in a local market. 1  This kind of 
analysis is used to compare country markets before making investment decisions. Decision 
makers supplement strategic information about market size, market growth, presence of local 
suppliers, support industries, and the strengths of local competitors with, for example, esti-
mates of current and future socio-economic and political risks that are country speciﬁ c. In 
this chapter we will particularly examine political risk, but ﬁ rst we will examine a well-known, 
general framework for analyzing and comparing country conditions: PEST analysis.  
 Generic PEST analysis 
 One of the simplest, most general, and multidisciplinary frameworks for understanding 
change at the broadest level is the   PEST framework ( Figure  15.2 ). This is used to map 
out particular competitive environments or investment  contexts  for ﬁ rms at the regional or 
national level, compare country conditions, and build future scenarios to understand short-
term and long-term threats and opportunities. Inﬂ uential factors are divided into political, 
economic, social or socio-cultural, and technological (PEST), which in combination create 
particular opportunities and threats for ﬁ rms. PEST can be extended to PESTLE by adding 
legal factors, reﬂ ecting national legislative institutions and policies, and environmental fac-
tors, including local policies on waste and pollution. It can be used speciﬁ cally to assess new 
investment environments as an input into global expansion and market-entry strategies.   
 Clearly, there are strong interactions between the categories of factors. Political develop-
ments have a strong influence over economic change, particularly in emerging markets like 
China. Similarly, economic, social, and technological factors are interdependent. However, the 
PEST breakdown makes the task of analyzing a complex range of influences more manageable. 
 On the face of it, this kind of framework may look too general and simple to guide man-
agement strategy. The general PEST overview shown above, however, is just a starting point 
to organize more focused analyses. Rigor can be added and accuracy improved in two ways: 
 1  Add depth. To fully understand the nature of the changes taking place within each of the 
categories, further tools and techniques are needed:

within regions or countries. Formal rankings are published to guide investors along

the same lines as insurance assessors (see related discussions later in this chapter). 
Such analyses also map out the key political constituencies, central and regional 
agencies, key ministers and bureaucrats, as well as changing forms of legislation in 
different countries as an input into MNE strategy and implementation (for example, 
aiding the development of personal contacts and networks in target countries).  
 ■   Economic analyses cover everything from national-level to industry-sector or market-
specific trends. Companies compiling return on investment (ROI) projections need 
to know something about productivity levels that can be expected in would-be 
plants, encompassing data on employees, technologies, support industries, local 
utilities, and so on. Any investment that relies on some element of local financing will 
need data on local interest rate trends, lending conditions, and the general stability of 
domestic capital markets, for example. 
 ■   Social trends analyses are relevant for firms looking to market new products and 
services in new countries. Mapping patterns of disposable income, customer prefer-
ences, and regional differences in these requires a combination of quantitative and 
qualitative analyses. Statistical overviews covering demographics, buying patterns, 
and market research need to be complemented with insights into socio-cultural 
norms and changing patterns of expectations if advertising messages are to be 
pitched correctly. 
 2  Add foresight.  Arguably the most difficult challenge facing any decision maker is to pre-
dict the future. The complexity that results from the variety of factors managers need 
to consider when making international business decisions adds immeasurably to this 
uncertainty. Accurate scenario building is central to the strategic planning and future 
success of any firm and can be done using the PEST framework as a starting point. 
Rather than creating grandiose visions of the future, managers need to extrapolate accu-
rately and objectively from the past and current trends across all the PEST dimensions 
to map out the likelihood of different futures and the implications of these for particular 
global strategies.

 This is the Chinese character for “risk.” The first symbol is for “danger,” the second symbol is for 
“opportunity.” Risk is seen as danger and opportunity combined. 
 Political risk   is the probability that political forces will negatively affect a ﬁ rm’s proﬁ t 
or impede the attainment of other critical business objectives. The study of political risk 
addresses changes in the environment that are difﬁ cult to anticipate. Common examples 
include the election of a government that is committed to nationalization of major indus-
tries or one that insists on reducing foreign participation in business ventures.  
 Most people believe that political risk is confined to Third World countries or to those 
with unstable governments. However, the shifting policies of triad region governments 
illustrate that political risk is also an issue for firms doing business in highly industrialized

 Why was the timing right for Kodak’s market (re-)entry into China? 
 Kodak’s success in China was partly due to the timing of its initiative. Political factors favored 
the unusual agreement struck with the Chinese government, adding to the economic, social, 
and strategic factors that led to its success. A PEST framework helps identify these factors. 
 Political  trends in the mid- to late 1990s included a strong move toward liberalization in 
China with specific concessions for firms making large capital investments, employing local 
labor, and transferring particular technologies. This was associated with government-driven 
privatization and industry deregulation. Specifically for Kodak, the ownership regulations 
and the introduction of the FISC status was critical. External relations changed dramatically 
with a move toward WTO entry and the reciprocal moves by other dominant economies, 
no tably the United States with Clinton’s state visit in August 1998. China was seen to be polit-
ically stable with little chance of retrenchment to a central command-and-control economy. 
 Economic trends pointed to a strong economy growing moderate to fast (around 8 per-
cent GNP growth per year); large flows of inward FDI, including particularly large invest-
ments from US MNEs (GM, GE, Motorola, Coca-Cola); and strong growth of disposable 
income in the domestic market. On the downside, growing unemployment from denation-
alized industries was a destabilizing influence, and there were additional uncertainties 
about local capital markets, which were highly unsophisticated. 
 Socio-cultural  change in China was also dramatic, including growing income levels and 
growing expectations, changing consumer tastes and preferences, coupled with the rise in 
unemployment and reduction in state-sponsored social welfare. Capitalist entrepreneur-
ship was on the rise, creating distinct social tensions between old and new. 
 Technological  strengths had long existed in China, founded on a good education system 
and a relatively advanced science and technology infrastructure. The country had some 
specific weak points and gaps in its industrial capabilities that government policy makers 
were keen to fill through alliances with Western firms and governments, again providing 
opportunities for particular MNEs.

nations. Governments routinely protect key industries for reasons of national security, self-
sufficiency, or national culture. Examples include US restrictions on foreign investment 
in the banking, defense, and commercial airline industries; Japanese protection of its rice 
producers; and France’s limitations on foreign involvement in its film and media businesses. 
The EU and US governments have long supported their regional champions in the aerospace 
industry, partly for security reasons, partly to protect local firms. Airbus spent $11 billion 
on building the A380 double-decker jumbo jet, one-third of which came from European 
taxpayers. This exacerbated the trade battles in this industry, refereed by the WTO. 2  
 Much of this political sparring is predictable. It is unanticipated change stemming from 
complexity and uncertainty that creates more dangerous kinds of risk. However, these 
examples indicate the pervasiveness of political risk. Given the large number of inter-
national markets in which MNEs operate, political risk is going to remain an area of 
concern. In dealing with this issue, effective negotiating can help to reduce and contain 
problem areas. This will be explained later in the chapter. 
  Deregulation and political risk 
 Overall there has been a general trend toward liberalization, deregulation, and the open-
ing up of national borders over the past 15 to 20 years, and this has been a major driver of 
globalization.  Table   15.1    shows the growing number of regulatory changes that have been 
favorable to FDI. In particular, the progressive liberalization of countries with large domes-
tic markets and extensive privatization or denationalization programs underway, such as 
China, Brazil, and India, has signiﬁ cantly changed the global economy. Huge opportunities 
exist for MNEs in these countries, and they have responded by investing to establish them-
selves in these new markets. 
 FDI inflows into these countries, particularly China, have grown immensely. India recorded 
inflows of only $237 million in 1990, then increased to $2,151 million in 1995. The inflows 
jumped to $6,598 million in 2000 following the politically led liberalization process. By 2008, 
the figure was at $41,554 million. In 2008, FDI into developing countries rose to $620,733 
million compared to $36,897 million in 1990, representing an increase of 1,682 times. It 
accounted for an estimated 36.57 percent of global FDI inflows, compared to 18 percent in 
2000. 3  Since then China in particular has risen to be a leading recipient of FDI each year. In 
2008, the FDI inflows to China was $108,312 million (see  chapter 20 Emerging economies). 
 For these giant emerging markets major political shifts led to the start of the process of 
integrating with the global economy and the opening up of their borders to foreign inves-
tors. Continuous, small, but significant changes to their policies and legislation regarding 
FDI and the activities of MNEs mean that ongoing assessments of political risk in these 
countries is of paramount importance to investors. The governments of these countries, 
together with their massive, complex civil service bureaucracies, maintain a strong level of 
control over their economies, and the direction and pace of change remains unpredictable.

CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
  The nature of political risk 
 We can examine political risk at two different levels, as seen in  Figure   15.3   . 4 Legal/governmental 
risks are potentially harmful to foreign businesses but are the product of, or permissible within, 
the existing political, economic, and legislative system. Non-legal or extra-governmental risks 
lie outside this system and are a violation of existing laws. Macro-level risks affect all foreign 
ﬁ rms evenly, and micro-level risks harm individual or speciﬁ c groups of ﬁ rms. 
 Macro political risk 
 A  macro political risk   is one that affects all foreign enterprises in the same general way. 
 Expropriation  , the governmental seizure of private businesses coupled with little, if any, 
compensation to the owners, is an example of a macro political risk. Communist govern-
ments in Eastern Europe and China expropriated private ﬁ rms following World War II. Fidel 
Castro did the same in Cuba from 1958 to 1959. In more recent years governments in Angola, 
Chile, Ethiopia, Peru, and Zimbabwe have expropriated private enterprises. In some cases this 
stems from  indigenization laws  , which require that nationals hold a majority interest in all 
enterprises. The privatization of a range of state-owned industries in Russia marked a turning 
point in that country’s history. However, the corruption and racketeering that led to politically 
connected individuals building massive fortunes from, for example, the oil and aluminum 
industries may have triggered another turning  point (see  Real Case: Yukos and the Russian 
oligarchs  in this chapter). The government has threatened to re-nationalize key industries. 5  
 Macro political risk can also be the result of political boycotts. During the war in Iraq, 
following 9/11 in the United States, American consumers boycotted French imports and 
avoided holidaying in France because the French were unsupportive of the military invasion 
of Iraq. 6  In all these cases both large and small businesses feel the impact of the political 
decision.     
 Micro political risk 
 A  micro political risk   is one that affects selected sectors of the economy or speciﬁ c foreign 
businesses. These risks are typically a result of government action in the form of industry 
regulation, taxes on speciﬁ c types of business activity, and local content laws.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 A number of factors help to determine the degree of micro political risk. One is the 
dominance of foreign firms or the growing competitiveness of their products in an indus-
try. For example, small and medium-sized makers of precision tools for the electronics 
industry in the United States joined forces to lobby for higher tariffs on imports that 
compete with their products, including those made by large US firms offshore. Prompted 
by the growing trade deficit and job losses in manufacturing, they have used the National 
Association of Manufacturers to push the government to defy WTO regulations and pro-
tect their particular businesses by increasing specific tariffs. 7 
 The end of the global textile quota system in January 2005 drastically changed the com-
petitive environment for countries like Kenya and Pakistan. Under this system the United 
States and the European Union restricted textile imports according to their country of 
origin. This had the effect of partly protecting these countries from direct competition with 
countries like India and China, because they had a guaranteed volume of exports to the big 
markets. Up to 60 percent of Pakistan’s annual export income came from the textile sector, 
which employed more than half of the country’s industrial workforce, so this change has 
had a significant impact on its economy. 8 
 This last example shows that some political risks are predictable and can be partly 
planned for. Others are not and tend to have a more significant effect. The changing pri-
orities of governments, often swayed by powerful interest groups, are an important source 
of this kind of risk. As discussed below, governments have specific economic, social, and 
often military agendas, and changes in these will result in adjustments to the various levers 
that control trade and the activities of foreign investors.   
  Sources of political risk 
 There are a number of sources of political risk.  Table   15.2    presents some important sources 
and their effects. 
 So a variety of motivations help to explain political risk. The MNE’s challenge is to 
identify these motivations and then to decide how to manage them.

CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
 As described above, the PEST framework provides a simple way of mapping the pros and 
cons of foreign investment opportunities in particular countries for MNEs. There are many 
other analytical tools and techniques to measure the cost–beneﬁ t or risk–reward ratio for a 
speciﬁ c investment proposition. These range from scenario planning, Delphi exercises, and 
multivariant risk analyses to simple observation. The degree to which companies actually 
use these techniques before investing abroad varies a great deal. 
 Small firms, especially owner-managed firms, often move from simple exporting to 
engage in FDI on the basis of the owner, CEO, or senior manager seeing an opportunity 
when on holiday in a foreign country! Little or no rigorous risk analysis or comparison of 
opportunities between countries is conducted, partly because it takes time and is expen-
sive, but often because managers are unaware of the need for analysis and/or ignorant of 
the tools, techniques, and information resources that can help them make these decisions. 9 
Most firms, however, will conduct some level of analysis to capture the likely costs and 
benefits and probable risks relating to a particular overseas investment. 
 There are many sources of information on the PEST conditions in different country 
markets for use in comparative risk analysis. Country risk rating services are provided 
by a range of agencies that produce general reports and may conduct specific analyses on 
behalf of client companies. Such agencies include the Bank of America World Information 
Services, the Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) SA, the Control Risks 
Information Services (CRIS), the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), Standard and Poor’s 
Ratings Group, the Political Risk Services (ICRG), and Moody’s Investor Services. 
 BERI political risk services, for example, began in 1966 using 15 variables, such as 
bureaucratic delays, monetary inflation, and political stability, to “isolate to the degree 
possible the political process affecting business.” It contained a weighting to emphasize 
certain criteria (such as political stability) over others in terms of their significance and 
impact. The sum of the weights was 25 and each of the 15 factors was then scored at four 
times its weight, so the highest possible points and lowest risk was 100. A global panel of 
experts (although US-based experts dominated) then assessed the score for each variable 
in a Delphi-style validation to help rank 40 to 50 countries according to the resulting con-
sensus. Scores between 70 and 56 were defined as moderate risk, denoting overall stability 
despite the varied risk of complications that might affect day-to-day operations for busi-
nesses. Any country with a rating under 56 was considered unstable. 
 The FORCE Country Reports from BERI also provide a qualitative analysis of socio-
political, economic, and financial forecasts. They include scenario analyses and so-called 
political, operations, and remittance/repatriation risk indices and profit opportunity rec-
ommendations (POR). The BERI risk measurement components include several categories 
of information, such as political factionalization, linguistic/ethnic/religious tension, coer-
cive measures to maintain regime, prevalence of corruption, radical left strength, depend-
ence on major external power, and so on. 10 
  Online risk information resources 
 An increasing number of country rating and indexing schemes are available online. One 
of the best is the World Bank and IMF site ( http://rru.worldbank.org/DoingBusiness/ ), 
which is a useful resource for off-the-shelf reports, such as  Doing Business  in country X 
this year. But it also allows users to create customized reports using an online database 
of indicators across 145 countries. This is linked to specialized topic areas covering prac-
tical guidelines for investing and managing in different countries, including Starting a

 http://www.economist.com/countries ; and  http://www.worldbank.org/data/countrydata/
countrydata.html . 
 One of the most widely used and well-respected sources of information is the Economist 
Intelligence Unit (EIU) ( www.eiu.com ). Alongside fairly general information it has a 
host of interactive services, most of which are for subscribers only. Its Risk Services site 
( http://www.eiuresources.com/ras/default.htm ) provides free snapshots of risk ratings and 
currently shows Iraq, Zimbabwe, and Myanmar as the riskiest propositions globally and 
Singapore, Spain, and Hong Kong at the top of its list. The EIU site also describes some of 
the indicators and the methodology underlying its Country Risk Service. 
 The Fraser Institute, with its very overt political view, compiles the Index of Economic 
Freedom ( http://www.fraserinstitute.ca and  http://www.freetheworld.com/ ). This com-
pares 23 components across seven areas (economic structures, monetary policy, etc.) to 
measure the degree to which host-country institutional arrangements and policies inter-
vene in or influence the operation of the economy. It also attempts to assess how predict-
able these arrangements and policies are and therefore how important they are as a source 
of market uncertainty. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) compiles an opacity index, which is closer to the kinds 
of analyses that examine non-legal activities by governments that might influence or inter-
vene in business ( http://www.opacity-index.com ). This measures the impact of business, 
economic, legal, and ethical opacity on the cost of capital around the world. 
 Finally, as an indication of the importance of these kinds of analyses, the World 
Economic Forum (WEF) has developed a Public Institutions Index as an input for its 
overall annual global competitiveness ranking ( http://www.weforum.org/ ). This index 
comprises a Contracts and Law subindex (covering judicial independence, property rights, 
organized crime, favoritism in government decision making) and a Corruption subindex 
(including irregular payments for imports and exports, tax collection, and public utilities). 
The Public Institutions Index for Africa, for example, rates Botswana top and Chad bottom 
of a list of 21 African countries. This ranking is one factor influencing the overall attractive-
ness and competitiveness of each country.  
 Quantifying risk vulnerability 
 As shown by the above risk ratings services, all risk is relative. Measuring risk therefore 
involves comparing options, one investment proposition against another. This means com-
bining investment appraisal and country appraisal techniques. There are factors that may be 
more important for one kind of investment than another. So a production plant will have 
different requirements than a distribution or marketing operation, or an offshore IT service 
ofﬁ ce, for example. Therefore different risk criteria are more or less relevant at the country 
level.  Table  15.3 shows the  Weighted Country Risk Assessment Model   for combining both.  
 Two different country cases (A and B) are compared using 30 different criteria; 15 are 
political in nature and 15 are economic, although many of the latter are also directly or 
indirectly influenced by the governments. The Risk column gives a rating (1 is low risk; 
5 is high) comparing Country A and Country B on this criterion and can represent either 
a direct comparison (for example, high or low current disposable income levels) or a risk 
measure—the potential for change that would harm the investment proposed (for 
ex ample, the likelihood that disposable income levels will fall significantly in the future). So, 
for example, Country A is rated as more politically stable than B and has a lower likelihood 
of  internal conflicts, more predictable policies, a more stable tax and tariff regime, and fewer

(less likelihood of) bureaucratic delays. Economically the two countries are a little more sim-
ilar, although Country A, for example, clearly rates higher in terms of upholding intellectual 
property rights, so there is less risk of breaches of copyright, patents, or brands. They have 
fairly similar domestic economic environments in terms of the listed criteria, with Country 
A having experienced better growth in the past five years, but expecting the same growth 
prospects as B for the next three years. This relative country rating across the three categories 
is summarized by the totals at the foot of the table: 67 for Country A and 101 for Country B.  
 The Importance column rates each of the same 30 criteria in terms of relevance to the 
kind of investment proposed. This example has been designed to reflect an overseas invest-
ment for a production facility, mainly for exports. Criteria such as export restrictions, 

474
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
the availability of high-quality labor, the stability of taxes and tariffs, policy continuity, 
bureaucratic delays, and enforceability of contracts, for example, are considered impor-
tant (rating 5 or 4). Economic growth and per capita income, for example, are considered 
less important. These would be important if we were considering a sales and distribution 
operation for consumer products, for example. As this illustration shows a country com-
parison, not a comparison of different types of investment, the Importance columns for 
Country A and Country B are identical. If we were to compare types of investment, we 
would change the ranking of the various criteria (between 1 and 5), but the total for this 
column would still need to add to 100, otherwise the weighting method would not work. 
In this case we would simply be changing the  relative  importance of different risk factors 
to suit a different type of investment proposition. 
 The combined score weights each country criteria according to respective importance 
to the type of investment under consideration, and the combined totals provide an overall 
comparison of the two countries. The higher the final score the riskier the combination of 
investment and location. Country A, with 223 out of a possible 500 appears to be a better 
option for this kind of investment than Country B with 339. 
  Table   15.3    presents a fairly basic example. The list of criteria can be changed and 
extended to far more than 30 and sub-criteria (for example, different kinds of bureau-
cratic delays under item 10) can be added. The balance among political, economic, social, 
technological, or legal criteria can also be altered according to the investment proposition 
and/or the countries to be considered. We could also use a different Likert scale, such as 
from 1 to 10 rather than 1 to 5. The model can be extended to compare more than two 
country cases. For any extension of the model it is important to remember that the ratings 
are  relative . For example, the above-mentioned BERI political risk ratings show Zimbabwe 
as riskier than Peru. We might give the former 5 for some of the political criteria in the 
Risk column and the latter a comparative 2 or 3. If we were to add Sweden to the com-
parison, the rating in the Risk column would need to reflect the change, perhaps by giving 
Zimbabwe and Peru 5 in some categories and Sweden 1. So the rating scores are not abso-
lute. They depend on the country comparison being made. 
 Note that this model only provides a summary framework for estimating relative  country 
risk. In practice it will only reflect the intelligence that goes into the relative risk ratings. A 
thorough and rigorous analysis of all the factors that underlie even the limited number of 
30 criteria in  Table   15.3   , in terms of both current and future investment conditions is not 
easy. In some cases quantitative data are available, including from some of the agencies 
and sources listed above. For other criteria, such as political stability or the likely impact 
of corruption, there is no such thing as perfect information, and assumptions, estimates, 
and some subjective guesswork are always necessary. However, the better the expertise, 
information, and experience that can be leveraged to make such assessments, whether 
from inside or outside the firm, the more accurate the relative final scores are going to be. 
 What the model also helps decision makers do is identify the kinds of risks they may be 
able to reduce, adapt to, prepare for, or guard against prior to or following an investment. 
Knowing which sources of risk you can influence, and which you cannot, puts you in a 
better position to manage a market-entry strategy. Negotiating with government agencies, 
customs officials, or local unions; establishing alliances with local recruitment agencies or 
banks; or generally developing networks of local contacts and advisors can all help monitor 
and alleviate some of these risks and are essential. 
 In practice, a common problem is for managers to fail to consider the full range of country 
risks that might affect an investment or to make uninformed assumptions in their appraisal. 
A project team responsible for capital budgeting in an accounting or finance department of a 
firm may not know a great deal about different country conditions. Project investment mod-
els and financial scenarios may be transferred with a range of built-in assumptions that can 

475
CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
hide additional costs or risks from the appraisal. For example, differences in labor rates are a 
key driver for the movement of manufacturing plants and for offshoring. Many companies 
build in the reduced labor cost, which makes savings and resulting profits look impressive, 
but assume similar levels of productivity and transactions costs for the new overseas oper-
ation. The additional costs and risks may become more obvious over time, with experience, 
and profit can quickly turn to loss. This has happened to some of the large numbers of 
companies that have outsourced parts of their IT and back-office operations to India, for 
ex ample. 11  So how can we build country risk analysis into our financial planning tools?  
  Accounting for country risk 
 International managers can incorporate elements of the above kinds of risk analysis into 
ﬁ nancial appraisal models when considering FDI. A ﬁ ve-year ROI (Return on Investment) 
or ROA (Return on Assets) model should take account of a range of risks as an input into 
ﬁ nancial estimates of costs and revenue. This enables a more realistic comparison between 
 countries as locations for various kinds of investment. Although never perfect, because we have 
incomplete information about the past and present, and it is impossible to accurately forecast 
the future, this can still help decision makers build better estimations. They can develop a bet-
ter understanding about the likely impact of certain events or changes on speciﬁ c investment 
propositions; they can compare investment propositions across different country contexts; 
and they can revise estimates for investment returns on the basis of this kind of analysis. 
 Companies that try to incorporate risk estimation in financial appraisals tend to build 
on standard financial models at the project level. The most common work on the basis of 
net present value (NPV), ROI, or internal rate of return (IRR) calculations, and these can 
incorporate country risks in a number of ways. A common approach is to increase the 
hurdle rate for ROI at the pre-project consideration stage, which will deselect the riskiest 
propositions. The hurdle rate is the set rate of financial return over a period of time that 
covers both project costs and the cost of the capital needed for the investment. Companies 
or business units will often have a set rate of return below which they will not invest. A 
simple rule of thumb would be to increase the rate of return in line with the additional 
risks associated with locating the investment in a particular country, compared to another. 
 Also common is to adjust the cash flows of the project to reflect the potential impact of a 
particular event on the value of the project. So, for example, if policy changes that will lead to 
an increase in tax rates, import duties, or labor costs are likely, this risk needs to be built into 
the long-run calculation of the break-even point of an investment. There is a probability that 
costs will rise and net revenues will decline so this can be built into a five- or six-year forecast 
for an investment. The term   adjusted present value   (APV) is sometimes used to denote an 
NPV that takes into account the riskiness of the project’s expected future cash flows.  
 More sophisticated techniques for accounting for country risk have been developed. 
Some firms attempt to place specific probabilities on certain events taking place and calcu-
late the direct cost implications for the project. This approach works well as an extension 
of the above country risk assessment model, but again relies on accurate information and 
intelligence to derive realistic probabilities. If political analysts estimate that there is, say, 
a 20 percent chance that the government of a particular developing country will change 
in the next three years resulting in a radical change in policies toward foreign investors, 
this risk can be reflected in a higher hurdle rate for the APV and an alternative location 
for the investment might look more promising. This kind of approach is often termed 
 sensitivity analysis  and can be combined with formal  scenario analyses . More sophisticated 
real-options analyses might attempt to calculate relative costs and benefits of, for example, 
closing a facility, moving it to another country, scaling down operations, or continuing in 
the face of a significant economic or political shock.

 What kinds of political risk did Kodak face and how did it attempt to mitigate 
these risks? 
 There were a range of uncertainties facing Kodak, from the macro to the micro, stem-
ming from the ways that government agencies intervened both legally and illegally in the 
operations of foreign firms in China. From the start it was clear that top-level negotiations 
were going to be required to secure the kind of joint-venture arrangements needed both 
to establish a significant production operation and to exclude rival Fuji from the same 
access. George Fisher’s direct connections with the most senior political figure of the 
time, Zhu Rongji, could have been the key that unlocked doors all the way down the central 
and regional bureaucracies. This well-publicized, high-level support also helped mitigate 
against discrimination and corruption at the lower levels, since the deal had the backing 
(and the attention) of senior officials in Beijing (and the United States). Kodak still had 
to make a range of payments and gestures of good citizenship to appease the powerful 
local constituencies in the places where it invested. In the years following the investment, 
various changes in policy and in the networks of power undoubtedly meant that at various 
levels Kodak has had to continue “smoothing the way” just like any other firm in China. 
Beyond these more predictable risks, there were, and always will be, highly uncertain and 
uncontrollable kinds of risks, such as widespread social unrest or large-scale political 
upheaval, which even powerful firms such as Kodak can do little to influence.       
 There are two key steps in developing effective negotiating strategies. First, MNE managers 
need to evaluate their own position and that of the other group(s) in order to determine 
how the interests of both can ﬁ t together. Second, they need to understand the “modus 
operandi” of the other groups: who has the power to make what kinds of decisions and 
what negotiating style are they likely to adopt? 
 Earlier in this chapter we discussed how widespread deregulation and liberalization 
were opening up emerging markets, like China and India, to foreign investors. Central 
and regional government agencies still maintain a strong control over these economies 
and the rules of engagement for foreign investors, so it is imperative that MNE managers 
understand: (1) their political, economic, and social policy objectives; (2) their levers of 
power, the mechanisms by which they can influence the costs and benefits of doing busi-
ness (taxes, tariffs, quotas, regulations on capital transfers, local input requirements, etc.); 
(3) the structures, networks, and institutional agencies through which they operate (who 
has the power to influence what?); and (4) their negotiation style and tactics. These repre-
sent the why’s and how’s of government intervention in market forces, and firms have to 
adapt to these to improve their chances of investment success.  
  Figure   15.4    depicts the interplay among: (1) the elements that attract multinational 
firms to a particular region, which have been discussed throughout this text (central col-
umn); (2) the strategic aims of MNEs; and (3) some general policy aims of governments. 
 NEGOTIATION STRATEGIES 
These techniques not only alert managers to relative sources of risk when comparing 
investment propositions, but also can help develop strategies to reduce risk. In the case of 
the developing country where the change of political party is likely to adversely affect foreign 
investors, this may lead to political lobbying by foreign firms with investments at risk. It 
also leads, unfortunately, to MNEs actively intervening in unethical ways in the national 
politics of smaller nations to secure their interests.

477
CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
MNE objectives may or may not fit with government aims and this will affect the invest-
ment decision. 
 Taking this a step further, the most effective negotiation strategies are those that incor-
porate (1) the relevant risk criteria in  Table   15.3    that can be influenced through nego-
tiation, (2) the evolving government policy priorities, and (3) the appropriate government 
agencies, local organizations, and key individuals who should be approached. This helps 
reduce the risk or increase the potential rewards from cross-border investments. If energy 
resources are important for a large-scale manufacturing facility, can local authorities guar-
antee energy supplies at a particular cost over a particular period in return for the plant 
being located in their region? If labor costs are an important factor, can these be fixed for 
a period of time through negotiations with local trade unions? 
 Negotiations between MNEs and national governments or local organizations are a 
two-way bargaining process where each party has something the other wants. We can 
identify power resources or bargaining chips held by MNEs looking to invest globally on 
the one hand and by the governments of host countries on the other. Governments look 
for inflows of capital and technology, for large local employers, and for access, via MNEs, 
to overseas markets to boost exports and foreign exchange reserves. To get these they lever-
age their attractiveness, which may consist of large or growing domestic markets, natural 
resources, cheap or productive labor, and economic and political stability to which they 
may add specific incentives, such as tax breaks or higher levels of foreign ownership or 
profit repatriation than normally allowed. 
 The bargaining strength of both firms and governments is limited by the degree of 
competition. If other MNEs offering similar levels of capital investment, employment, or 
technology exist, the negotiating position of one MNE is weakened. If other regions offer 
cheaper labor, more economic or political stability, or better incentives to foreign inves-
tors, the negotiating position of the government is weakened.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 The bargaining strengths for an MNE may come from its technology, products, ser-
vices, managerial expertise, and capital. For example, when General Motors sets up a new 
operation in Mexico, the company invests capital, uses modern technology to build the 
autos, and employs managerial expertise in getting the operation off and running. When 
the Hilton Corporation builds a new hotel in Germany, it invests capital, employs mana-
gerial expertise, and offers a variety of world-class hospitality services to the guests. MNEs 
also hire local personnel, stimulate the economy, and in industries such as manufacturing, 
textiles, and mining help to generate exports for the country. 
 The bargaining strengths of the country will include such factors as large consumer 
markets, economic and political stability, sources of capital, tax breaks, and an appropriate 
labor force. The United States, for example, offers all these strengths to MNEs. As a result, 
the bargaining position of foreign MNEs vis-à-vis the US government is diminished. This 
is in comparison to the situation faced by companies looking to set up operations in less 
developed countries where the latter have a weak bargaining position because of their small 
consumer market, political instability, and/or financial strength. 
 Other parties involved in a negotiation will also have specific strengths. For example, in 
many cases a local partner knows the market and has conducted business there for years. 
This makes the partner valuable to the MNE. Other contributions of local partners can 
include capital, a well-trained workforce, factories or retail outlets for moving the goods to 
the customer, and government contractors who can help to eliminate red tape. 
 Other parties to the transaction can include stockholders or other interest groups that 
monitor the company’s operations. During the 1980s many MNEs stopped doing business 
in South Africa because of pressure from these investor groups (see the case  International 
Business Strategy in Action: Political risk for De Beers ). Companies involved in manu-
facturing war material, producing chemicals, and building nuclear energy plants have 
also come under investor and social pressure. MNEs may also encounter complaints from 
partners in other joint ventures who feel that this latest investment will negatively affect 
their current venture. 12 
 The membership of the WTO and various trading blocs around the world, particularly 
the EU and NAFTA, directly affect the degree to which national governments  can intervene 
in trade and FDI. Governments in emerging markets and developing countries have more 
direct influence over the running of the economy and the rules and regulations governing 
trade and investment. However, once they have joined the WTO (as China did in 2001) 
their use of legislation governing foreign equity participation, profit repatriation, cross-
border M&A, and local content rules, as well as tax and investment incentives, becomes 
more restricted. At this stage, though, and in the foreseeable future for such countries, a 
higher level of direct control over the economy and foreign relations represents a signifi-
cant influence over the ever-changing opportunities and risks for investors. 
 Finally, individual politicians and civil servants in less developed countries are able to use 
their own influence more effectively to block or to facilitate a particular MNE investment. 
This is partly due to the higher level of government control over the economy and individual 
businesses, but also because of the relative lack of legal or institutional recourse to challenge 
government actions. Couple this with the fact that salaries for government officials and 
bureaucrats in poorer countries tend to be very low and you get an insight into why corrup-
tion is so much more prevalent in developing countries, as discussed in the following section. 
  Behavioral characteristics of the participants in negotiations 
 When it comes to the actual process of cross-border negotiations there is a range of cultural, 
behavioral, and tactical differences between groups that international managers need to 
understand if they are to negotiate effectively.

CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
 Political risk for De Beers 
 With an estimated $7 billion in 2011, Nicky Oppenheimer 
is one of the richest people in Africa, the world’s poorest 
continent. His family still owns nearly half of De Beers and 
a sizable piece of Anglo American, another mining giant 
with interests in gold, platinum, construction, and forestry. 
De Beers is 45 percent owned by the mining company 
Anglo American, while South Africa’s Oppenheimer family 
owns 40 percent. The government in Botswana owns the 
remaining 15 percent. 
 The De Beers name is synonymous with diamonds. 
Established in 1888 in Johannesburg, South Africa, it is the 
largest mining company in the world. It recently reported 
earnings of $483 million. But De Beers once controlled 
(not directly mined) about 80 percent of the world supply 
of rough stones. The De Beers Groups Diamond Trading 
Company (DTC), formerly the Central Selling Organization 
(CSO), maintained a cartel for limiting supply and driving up 
prices. Competitors have reduced this share by challenging 
its single-channel distribution system and by developing 
other sources of diamonds outside of its control. In Canada, 
Australia, and Russia rival mining firms like BHP Billiton, Rio 
Tinto, and Alrosa have found huge deposits of lucrative stones 
and developed new technologies to mine them efficiently. 
As recently as 1998 De Beers’ share was down to around 
65 percent, and today production from its own mines gives it 
just a 45 percent share. Add to this its contract to sell Russian 
stones and its overall market share is around 55 percent, in 
a global market for rough diamonds worth about $8 billion. 
 In 2009, De Beers announced plans to raise up to $1bn 
(£607m) from investors. The rights issue was designed to 
help reduce the company’s debts, which currently totaled 
$3.5bn. The move came at the end of a bad year for De Beers, 
which saw first-half profits fall by 99 percent as a result 
of a collapse in the price of diamonds. Falling demand for 
diamonds forced De Beers mines in South Africa, Botswana, 
and Canada to take production holidays earlier in 2009. 
 De Beers faces a range of political risks. It is under threat 
from anti-globalization and ethical business groups for its 
involvement in civil wars in Sierra Leone, Angola, and Congo. 
It is also facing potentially damaging political and governance 
changes in South Africa, including calls to re-nationalize 
and/or place into “black hands” a range of natural resource-
based industries including mineral mining. More worry-
ing for the Oppenheimers is a legal campaign by activists 
who want reparations from firms that worked in apartheid 
South Africa. This is not currently being supported by South 
Africa’s government, but this may change. De Beers has 
some leverage since its operations have resulted in lucrative 
and stable tax revenues for the South African government, 
as well as for Botswana, Namibia, and Tanzania. 
 It has also built more stable relationships with some 
governments through joint ventures and cross-sharehold-
ings. Debswana, for example, is jointly owned (50–50) by 
De Beers and the Botswana government. It supports local 
supplier development and training programs, as well as 
boosting the country’s diamond exports (which account for 
four-fifths of total exports). The Botswana government cur-
rently owns 15 percent of De Beers. 
 The firm has been trying to cope with other sources 
of political risk, hindering its expansion into the end-
consumer markets of the triad for some time. De Beers was 
banned from directly entering the US market because of 
an antitrust legal ruling that sees it as a monopoly. Under 
the CSO, the group’s market dominance had allowed it to 
manipulate market prices by accumulating inventory. De 
Beers is allowed to operate in the EU, but has faced anti-
competition action, particularly in relation to its Russian 
and East European operations. A major watershed occurred 
in 2004 as De Beers finally pleaded guilty to charges of price 
fixing of industrial diamonds in an Ohio court and agreed to 
pay a $10 million fine, thereby ending a 60-year-long lock-
out of the US market. De Beers is now working directly in 
the largest diamond market, the United States. This might 
help it further leverage its recent partnership with luxury 
products firm LVMH to sell De Beers-brand diamonds.

  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Cultural differences 
 Although the objective of the negotiation process may be universal (strike as good a deal as 
possible), the way in which the process is carried out will be greatly inﬂ uenced by the cultural 
values and norms of the participants. Many of the following observations build on  Chapter 5 , 
which examines cultural differences between people from different countries around the world.

 What did both sides, Kodak and the Chinese government, gain from the deal? 
 Many of the clues to answering this question lie in the answers to question 1 and ques-
tion 2. The timing of Kodak’s investment suited the Chinese government in a number of 
ways. Zhu Rongji was leading a massive process of liberalization and deregulation across 
the economy as part of the shift toward a free market system. In the time leading up to 
Kodak’s entry, 300,000 firms were privatized, resulting in an increase in unemployment 
and some degree of social unrest. The Chinese government needed foreign firms to 
provide employment and new sources of income through capital investment. The govern-
ment’s economic development plans also highlighted the need for technology transfer and 
training to improve China’s capacity to create technologically sophisticated, higher-value 
manufactured products. Finally, the failure of many local firms, many of them recently pri-
vatized, had pushed local and some national banks into debt. Foreign capital was needed 
to maintain the pace of investment. 
 Kodak offered all of this. In return it wanted and gained exclusive access to produce 
locally, avoiding the tariff barriers; experienced local managers and engineers from the 
film-manufacturing sector, as well as low-cost employees; land, facilities, and infrastruc-
ture; and help with the complicated local rules and regulations, permissions, and licenses 
required to establish any operation in China. As a result, Kodak’s market share has grown 
impressively since its investment and China continues to thrive (to date).    
 Commenting on the difference between Arab and US negotiators, one group of researchers 
noted: 
  [Arabs] treat deadlines as only general guidelines for wrapping up negotiations. They tend to 
open negotiations with an extreme initial position. However, the Arabs believe strongly in making 
concessions, they do so throughout the bargaining process, and they almost always reciprocate 
an opponent’s concessions. They also seek to build a long-term relationship with their bargaining 
partners. For these reasons, Americans typically find it easier to negotiate with Arabs than with 
representatives from many other regions of the world.  
 One of the major differences is the amount of authority that the negotiator has to 
approve an agreement. In some societies, such as the United States and UK, negotiators 
are given authority to make deals or at least to express agreement on the basic arrange-
ment that is being negotiated. This approach works well when doing business with many 
Western firms, as well as with Chinese negotiators. However, it is often of limited value 
when dealing with people from other cultures. In fact, the other parties may not have the 
authority to give the go-ahead on anything. For example, Japanese and Russian negotiators 
are often lower-level personnel who are not authorized to approve agreements. This can 
be frustrating to Americans who feel that they are wasting their time. The lack of face-to-
face interaction with those who will be making the final decision can be unsettling. On 
the other hand, many foreign negotiators use this ploy because they have learned that it 
often leads to greater concessions from US business people, who become anxious to sign a 
deal and thus are more flexible on terms. These are some of the issues that Dell’s decision 
 makers needed to consider when they approached potential business partners in Latin 
America (see  International Business Strategy in Action: Dell goes to Brazil ). 

481
CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
 Dell goes to Brazil 
 In the late 1990s Dell examined the opportunities and risks 
of investing in Latin America. It was looking to replicate not 
just its direct sales activities but the whole of its “build to 
order” (BTO) model to serve the Latin American market. 
 At that time, Dell was growing faster than most other 
 Fortune  Global 500 firms and was rated as the number 
one performing stock in the Standard and Poor’s 500 for 
that decade. It was selling PCs globally, manufacturing in 
Xiamen, China, Penang, Malaysia, and Limerick, Ireland, as 
well as in the United States. However, despite its 20 percent 
share of the US market, in the large and growing Latin 
American market it trailed behind Compaq (22 percent 
share and 36 percent growth rate), IBM, HP, and several 
others. Dell ranked ninth and had barely 1.2 percent of the 
market. 
 One of the reasons for this was that Latin American con-
sumers did not adopt the Internet as fast as US consumers 
making it difficult for Dell to implement the direct market-
ing strategy that had worked so well in other markets. 
Instead, consumers ordered Dell computers via a toll-free 
number and the company shipped the product from its 
manufacturing facilities in Texas. 
 Dell sought to turn this around by changing its Latin 
American strategy. The major aims were to establish mar-
ket leadership by taking advantage of the rise in Internet 
penetration in Latin America to increase sales from 80,000 
units to 800,000 units in five years and to manufacture 
locally to avoid excessive import duties (an estimated 
30 percent) and transport and logistics costs. Not only did 
prospective market growth look healthy, with demand for 
PCs rising, but the growing use of the Internet and increas-
ing propensity for Latin Americans to buy online suited 
Dell’s model. Brazil was seen as the best place to locate 
Dell’s Latin American activities. It represented the largest 
country market in its own right, with one-fifth of the popu-
lation in the middle or upper middle-class income bracket 
and the recent appearance of free ISPs to encourage use 
of the Internet. For investing in production it had a central 
location, educated labor force, and government incentives 
for high-technology FDI. Moreover, PCs produced in Brazil 
could be exported without tariff to other Mercosur countries, 
which include Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. 
 Chile was considered as an alternative. But by comparison 
it had a more expensive (though on average better educated) 
labor force, fewer local suppliers, a higher level of local 
competition (relative to the size of the domestic market), 
similar government incentives to invest but a higher degree 
of political instability and a smaller local market. 
 But there were also risks, many of them macro-level 
risks shared with any other MNE looking to invest in 
Brazil. These included political instability regarding FDI 
regulations, tariff barriers, labor regulations, and econ-
omic instability regarding inflation and possible currency 
devaluation. Further uncertainties would affect Dell more 
directly. Shipping and distribution infrastructure was weak 
and there were also some reasonably strong, local, low-
cost PC producers that may have reacted strongly to new 
entrants (IBM and HP already operated at that time in 
Brazil). It was also difficult to assess the skill and capabil-
ities of the local workforce not only for manufacturing, but 
also for sales and after-sales service, which were key ele-
ments of Dell’s direct model. 
 In 1999 Dell opened an assembly plant in Eldorado do Sul, 
Brazil. In retrospect we know that both the global economic 
and competitive macro environment and the country-level 
environment in Brazil went through some turbulent changes 
after 1998 that would have been very difficult to predict, 
regardless of which of the country risk analysis techniques 
Dell had applied. The removal of many non-tariff import 
barriers in Brazil worked against the investment decision. 
However, market analysis shows that local competitors 
have done very well, regardless of Dell’s investment. In 2000 
Latin America’s top five—Compaq, Dell, HP, IBM, and Acer—
all lost market share. The firms not in the top five saw mar-
ket share increase from 50 to 59 percent, and local firms, 
such as Itautec and Metron from Brazil and Mexico’s Alaska, 
performed even better. Other events, such as the 1999 
currency (real) devaluation, high interest rates, the energy 
crisis, and the knock-on effects of the Argentinean financial 
crisis in 2001, followed by a general economic slowdown, all 
added complexity and further uncertainty after the invest-
ment had been made. By 2006, however, things looked well, 
the company was expanding into Hortolandia, São Paulo, by 
building a state-of-the-art plant. This has since enabled Dell 
to capture a better percentage of the growing market for IT 
hardware and software. 
 Globally Dell’s revenues have maintained remarkable 
growth, reaching $61 billion in 2011. Of this, 52 percent 
is generated from the United States and 48 percent from 
foreign countries. In terms of assets, 73 percent of total 
companies assets are in the United States and 27 percent 
in foreign countries. The growth was particularly strong

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Another cultural difference in negotiating style is the objective of the negotiators. As the 
typologies in  chapter 5  show, American, German, and British managers, for example, tend 
to be very practical and to focus on short-term results. Negotiators from the Far East tend 
to move more slowly, like to get to know the other party, and have a more long-run focus. 
Gift giving, social custom, and certain rituals can play an important part in negotiations 
and are part of the initial process of developing trust and mutual respect. 13 
 Language is also a key factor. When negotiators do not speak the same language and 
must use interpreters, there are more chances for a misinterpretation or misunderstanding 
to occur. This problem also exists in written communications. Schermerhorn, for example, 
has found that, when documents are translated from one language to another and then 
translated back to check for accuracy, there are interpretation problems. 14  The original 
translation appears to convey the desired information, but, when another person is called 
in to translate the document back into the original language, some parts of it are different 
from that intended initially. 
 A related cultural problem is the use of written documents. In some countries a written 
document is used as a basis for establishing what is to be done. As a result, the document 
is detailed and factual. In Germany it will be precise and technical, in the United States it 
will be legalistic. In other countries, however, a written document is viewed as the basis for 
a general agreement and the parties then negotiate the implementation as they go along. 
Chinese and other Far East negotiators often view detailed contracts as a sign of distrust 
and believe a more open-ended agreement should be used. 
 Acceptance zones 
 Each party to a negotiation will have an   acceptance zone   or an area within which it is will-
ing to negotiate. For example, if Anheuser-Busch InBev, Begium (InBev acquired Anheuser-
Busch in 2008) wants to buy a brewery in Düsseldorf, Germany, the Begium MNE will 
determine three prices: the highest price it is willing to pay, the price it would like to pay, 
and the offer at which it will begin the bargaining. For purposes of illustration, assume that 
Anheuser-Busch InBev, Begium is willing to pay up to €25 million for the company but hopes 
to make the acquisition for €23 million and intends to start the negotiation at €20 million.  
 Will Anheuser-Busch InBev be successful? This depends on the acceptance zone of the 
Düsseldorf brewer. If the company will not sell for less than €27.5 million, there will be no deal 
because the buyer’s maximum offer is less than the seller’s minimum acceptance. However, 
assume that the German firm will not sell for less than €21 million, would like to get €24 mil-
lion, and intends to start the negotiation at €28 million. In this case the two sides should be able 
to strike a deal since they have overlapping zones of acceptance, as illustrated in  Figure  15.5 . 
 Notice from  Figure   15.5    that, when the acceptance zones of the two parties overlap, 
there is common ground for negotiating. Additionally, keep in mind that, if the zones do 
in the BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and China—
where revenues increased by 21 percent. They now repre-
sent almost one dollar in every seven Dell makes. Growth 
in Europe and the Americas lagged behind at 3 percent. 
 This is particularly important in light of future forecasts 
which show that emerging markets overall (including these 
key Latin American countries) will be responsible for two-
thirds of the growth in the industry in the coming years. 
Dell needs to work out a better way of getting a bigger 
piece of this particular pie.

not overlap, negotiations will not always end in a stalemate. After listening to each other 
the parties may agree to change their respective bids and offers, adjust the acceptance 
zones, and end up with common negotiating ground.  
 In the case of  Figure   15.5    the two parties would eventually negotiate within a range of 
$21 million (the least amount the seller will take) and $25 million (the most the buyer will 
pay). It is not possible to say what the final price will be because this will depend on how 
willing each side is to concede ground to the other. However, whatever the final price, the 
seller is going to get at least the desired minimum and the buyer will not pay more than 
the established maximum. 
 Bargaining tactics 
 Negotiators use a range of bargaining tactics, including promises, threats, rewards, com-
mitments, and the use of self-disclosure, in their drive for a better deal. Some of these are 
also linked to different cultural characteristics, as shown in  Table   15.4   . Keeping silent is a 
standard Japanese practice when negotiating with each other as well as with foreigners. 
 Table   15.4    shows that each group of Japanese, American, and Brazilian negotiators has a 
series of behaviors that make it different from the other two. For example, the Japanese like 
to make recommendations, the Americans make wide use of promises, and the Brazilians 
rely heavily on self-disclosure. 15

 These behaviors and tactics are often used in international negotiations. Effective nego-
tiators learn how to use them and how to counteract their use by the opposition. Some 
examples are provided in the next section. 
  Transparency and corruption: politically sensitive political risk 
 One of the most difﬁ cult aspects of foreign business for international managers is how to 
cope with corruption. A very large number of ﬁ rms engage in bribery of various kinds, but 
the ethical issues are not straightforward. In many cases they argue that to opt out would 
simply mean they lose out to less ethically minded competitors. In other cases it is genu-
inely difﬁ cult to know whether such practices are simply the accepted local rules of the 
game. In the UK an extra payment to rail companies buys you a better seat on the train in 
a less crowded compartment. This is called “First Class.” In India an extra payment may get 
you onto a train that is already overbooked (or that you are told is overbooked). The only 
difference is that the payment will go straight into the ticket collector’s pocket, rather than 
the railway company. However, in many places it is accepted that workers in national indus-
tries or ofﬁ cials in government agencies will top up their incomes by offering these kinds 
of “discretionary services.” 
 There are very different levels of corruption, from the small scale to the very large scale. 
Our Indian ticket collector may make a few extra rupees each month from small-scale bribes. 
One estimate suggests that Mohamed Suharto, President of Indonesia from 1967 to 1998, 
built a personal fortune of between $15 and $35 billion through embezzlement, in a country 
with an average GDP per capita (an indication of average annual salaries) of $695. 16  
 Governments, particularly those in previously centrally planned economies, are directly 
responsible for a large volume of purchasing. The volume of government expenditure on 
public procurement in China jumped from $0.4 billion in 1998 to $18.7 billion in 2003, 
as its economy and the need for large-scale infrastructure projects grew. By 2011 Chinese 
officials’ overseas trips, the procurement and maintenance of government cars and the fees 
for official receptions alone cost an estimated $132 billion a year. The country attracted a 
great deal of international attention for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing and Expo 2010 
in Shanghai. Government-funded events such as these pushed the government to limit 
corrupt practices through policies such as the Public Procurement Act. But such activ-
ities are not confined to emerging and developing countries. Bid rigging is widespread in 
Japan, particularly in the construction industry. The 2003 Act Concerning Elimination and 
Prevention of Involvement in Bid Rigging was an attempt by the Japanese government to 
curb such practices, which involve collusion among powerful  keiretsu , industry bodies, and 
government agencies. The amount lost due to bribery in government procurement globally 
is thought to be at least $400 billion. 
 The Berlin-based organization Transparency International (TI) produces a number of 
reports each year, of which the best known is the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). 
The CPI has promoted research into, and more open discussion of, the causes and con-
sequences of corruption.   Corruption   is defined by TI as “the misuse of public power for 
private benefit,” and each year TI has evolved the methodology to improve consensus and 
acceptance of the metrics that underlie the country rankings.  
 The extent of corruption is a measure of the  frequency  and  value  of corrupt payments 
and the resulting obstacle imposed on businesses. A composite index from different polls 
and surveys from independent institutions, including the World Economic Forum, the 
World Business Environment Survey of the World Bank, the Institute of Management 
Development (in Lausanne), PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Economist Intelligence Unit, 
and Gallup International on behalf of Transparency International, are used in the CPI. The 
2010 survey shows Denmark, New Zealand, and Singapore as the least corrupt economies,

Iraq 175th, Myanmar 176th, and Somalia 178th. 
 Another report is the  Bribe Payers Index  (BPI), which measures the “propensity of com-
panies from 30 leading exporting countries to bribe abroad.” It is based on the responses 
of more than 11,000 business people across 125 countries, polled in the World Economic 
Forum’s Executive Survey. Although multinational firms from advanced countries usually 
rank high in the index, they still regularly pay bribes. Companies from emerging econ-
omies, including the BRIC countries, tend to rank amongst the worst. Despite high-profile 
campaigns to reduce the amount of local corruption in these countries, their firms actively 
bribe when abroad. 
 Other reports by TI examine other elements of corruption, including the most promi-
nent offenders in specific countries, usefully comparing, for example, the judiciary, cus-
toms, police, local administrators, registry and permit officials, tax officials, and traffic 
police in various countries. Case studies and intra- or inter-regional comparisons also 
make up much of TI’s analysis. 17 
 The global corruption report by TI shows a clear correlation between corruption and 
income. Poorer countries (like Bangladesh) tend to have the highest incidence of cor-
ruption. In low-income, developing, and emerging markets, transparency is also more 
of a problem.   Transparency   reflects the  clarity  and  consistency  of policies and legislation 
applied in the governance of businesses and is strongly associated with corruption. There 
is considerable debate about the relative levels of corruption and transparency prevalent 
in developing and advanced countries. The latter do tend to have more governance checks 
and balances and arguably more freedom of the press and leeway for interest groups to 
reveal and oppose corrupt practices and transparency problems.  
 There is, however, a socio-cultural dimension to such issues, and in some countries cer-
tain established, recognized, and accepted business practices are considered to be the “local 
rules of the game” that should simply be respected and adapted to, rather than criticized 
as non-Western. Again, China provides a useful illustration. One of the key obligations for 
China as it joins a growing range of international organizations (such as the WTO) and 
legal treaties is to improve its transparency. In the past, import duties have been found to 
vary between 10 and 20 percent for the same product because customs officers across the 
country do not have a standard definition or system for categorizing product types. This 
has not just led to MNE managers and local importers having to engage in extended dis-
cussions with local officials regarding product categorization, but significantly increased 
the incentive and opportunity for bribery. 
 Government clean-up campaigns in China have focused on the standardization of rules 
governing both domestic and foreign businesses. The licensing procedures for both have 
tended to be unregulated and very much at the discretion of local officials who are said 
frequently to abuse the yearly check-up system ( Nianjin ) to earn additional fees before 
approving licenses. However, foreign firms without the necessary  guanxi (informal, recip-
rocal obligation networks) connections are subject to these and other additional charges. 
The more bizarre include the “spiritual civilization fee” and a “wall-cleaning fee” that can 
run into thousands of US dollars.

 MNEs take many steps to ensure that their strategies do not go awry because of unexpected 
developments. One of the most beneﬁ cial steps is the use of integrative and protective/
defensive techniques. 
 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND POLITICAL RISK 

486
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
  Use of integrative and protective/defensive techniques 
 There are a variety of stratagems that MNEs employ in reducing risk. Some are collec-
tively known as   integrative techniques  , which are designed to help the MNE become 
a part of the host country’s infrastructure. 18  The objective of an integrative technique 
is to help the company blend into the environment and to become less noticeable as 
a “foreign” ﬁ rm. One of the simplest ways is to use a name that is not identiﬁ ed with 
an overseas company and, if an acquisition is made, keep the old name in place. For 
example, Bridgestone is a Japanese tire company, but no one would know this based on 
the name of the company. Additionally, Bridgestone owns Firestone Tire & Rubber, but 
few Americans are aware of this fact. Similarly, Hoechst of Germany owns the Celanese 
Company, and most people do not know this. Nor do many people realize that almost 
25 percent of the banks in California are Japanese owned; their names provide no clues 
to their real owners. This tactic deﬂ ects public attention and concern that US assets are 
being swallowed up by overseas investors.  
 Another common integrative technique is to develop good relations with the host 
government and other political groups and to produce as much of the product as possible 
locally. In turn the MNE will hire and promote local personnel and use them to run a large 
portion of the operations. This strategy endears the company to the government and, if any 
action is taken against foreign firms, these firms are likely to be spared. 
 Protective and defensive techniques   are strategies that are designed to discourage a 
host country from interfering in multinational operations. In contrast to integrative tech-
niques, protective and defensive measures are aimed at fostering  non-integration  of the 
MNE into the local environment. A good example is conducting research and development 
(R&D) at other geographic locales and importing this knowledge as needed. Should the 
government suddenly decide to seize the firm’s facilities, the company’s R&D base would 
not be threatened. 
 Another protective and defensive technique is to limit the role of the local personnel 
to those operations that are not vital to the running of the facility. So if the government 
decides to take over the operation, the host-country personnel will not be able to handle 
things efficiently. Those with the requisite knowledge and training are overseas personnel 
who are sent on site by the multinational. 
 A third technique is to raise as much capital as possible from the host country and local 
banks. When this happens, the government is reluctant to interfere in operations because 
this may threaten its own investment and that of the home-country banks. In a manner 
of speaking, this strategy co-opts the government and brings it onto the MNE’s team. Any 
strike against the multinational is a blow against the host country. 
 A fourth technique is to diversify production among a number of countries. In this way, 
if the government seizes the MNE’s facilities, only one area of production is disrupted. The 
company can then reallocate production and get back on stream in short order. 
 Combination strategies 
 MNEs often use a combination of integration and protective/defensive techniques to reduce 
and manage their political risk.  Figure   15.6    provides an example of how companies can do 
this. In the case of the low-technology manufacturing ﬁ rm (#1 in  Figure   15.6   ), the only way 
to employ a protective/defensive strategy is to raise capital locally. As a result, this ﬁ rm will 
work to integrate itself into the country and to act very much like a local ﬁ rm. 
 An international air carrier (#2 in  Figure   15.6   ) will use an integrative strategy by set-
ting up local operations and by hiring people to staff the facilities, to maintain the aircraft, 
and to handle arrivals and departures. The airline will also help to generate money for the 
country by bringing in tourists and business people. At the same time the company will

seldom have more than a small percentage of its aircraft in this locale on any one day. 
Additionally, the pilots will often come from other countries and be highly skilled indi-
viduals, and the top management team will be operating out of headquarters in the home 
country. So while the air carrier will take some steps to accommodate the country, it will 
also be well positioned should the country decide to seize its aircraft or to increase taxes or 
airport fees. Moreover, aside from facilities at the airport, the company will usually have 
no other fixed assets except for the aircraft. Therefore any crackdown on the airline might 
result in retaliatory action by other airlines, which would refuse to fly into the country. 
Such action could seriously hamper the country’s economic growth. Consequently, a 
strategy that provides for the intermediate use of both integrative and protective/defensive 
techniques often works extremely well. 
 A high-technology R&D firm (#3 in  Figure   15.6   ) will not put much emphasis on inte-
grative techniques because it does not want to become integrated into the local economy. 
The firm may be situated where it is because the company finds that it is easier to recruit 
top talent to live in that region. Or other competitors may be headquartered there, and the 
company finds that it is easier to keep tabs on these firms by situating nearby. So while the 
company may hire local people to staff basic operations, personnel from other countries 
who live locally will handle all the R&D and other sophisticated functions. If the firm 
should hire local people for some of these R&D positions, the company will work to keep 
them loyal to the firm and not to the country. Thus if there is an attempt to seize the firm’s 
R&D facilities, the loss will be minimized. 
 In the case of an oil-producing and refining company (#4 in  Figure   15.6   ), the firm is 
likely to make strong use of both integrative and protective/defensive techniques. The 
company will need to get on well with the government since it is tapping the country’s 
natural resources. There is likely to be a great deal of hiring of local personnel for rou-
tine jobs. The firm will also work hard to generate as much revenue as possible since the 
government is unlikely to interfere with the operations of a revenue-producing firm. At 
the same time the MNE will maintain control of the more sophisticated jobs so that these 
cannot be carried out by anyone else. If the company were to be taken over, local workers 
would be unlikely to know how to operate the machinery and equipment efficiently.

 What are the lessons for other firms looking to enter emerging markets like 
China? 
 A simple lesson from the Kodak case is that understanding political risk and its underly-
ing sources can significantly increase your chances of making a successful investment in 
an uncertain emerging market. Kodak took the time and made the effort to understand 
what the risks were and how it could change some of the local rules of the game to its 
advantage. Kodak’s success stemmed from the way it matched its power resources with 
the needs of the different levels of Chinese government, from senior politicians in Beijing 
to the more junior officials who regulated business activities at the local level. It developed 
an understanding of the problems facing the Chinese administration and engineered its 
negotiations approach to highlight how the investment could help solve some of these 
problems. Following this, Kodak’s senior managers showed huge commitment to their 
investment, enduring several years of complex discussions with six provincial govern-
ments, ten city governments, five ministries and commissions, local tax authorities, and 
several banks and trust companies. They also had the foresight (or were co-opted) to fund 
a number of community projects, which earned them local support for the project and 
perhaps the brand. But do not forget that Kodak had the local government connections, 
the financial muscle, and a degree of political support from the US government to achieve 
all of this. The majority of international firms do not, and this can make the task of suc-
cessfully investing in somewhere like China even harder and far riskier. 
 
 1   Country risk analysis examines the chances of non-market events (political, social, and 
economic) causing financial, strategic, or personnel losses to a firm following FDI in a 
specific country market. 
  2   A PEST analysis provides a starting point for examining and comparing political, 
 economic, socio-cultural, and technological conditions in countries that present invest-
ment opportunities. Add depth and foresight to make PEST a little more rigorous.  
  3   Political risk is the probability that political forces will negatively affect an MNE’s 
profit or impede the attainment of other critical business objectives. This risk can be 
examined in terms of macro and micro factors. A macro political risk is one that affects 
 KEY POINTS 
Identifying sources of potential risk and assessing the possible impact on foreign invest-
ments of all kinds is difficult to do. Emerging and developing countries generally represent 
riskier markets, as well as potentially more rewarding markets for MNEs. Their rapid 
rate of growth, strongly interventionist policies, less mature government institutions, and 
evolving governance systems all create additional uncertainties for foreign investors. These 
add to the existing complexities of trying to cope with different economic, social, and 
cultural ways of doing things. International managers looking to invest in these countries 
need to develop an in-depth understanding of the ever-changing official, formal rules and 
regulations governing different kinds of investment. In addition to the country risk analy-
sis techniques introduced here, there is no substitute for direct experience. Only by visit-
ing and learning about the geographic, socio-cultural, economic, and political context in 
which business takes place can managers develop a qualitative, tacit understanding about 
the official, formal and the unofficial, informal local rules of the game.

CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
foreign enterprises in the same general way. A micro political risk is one that affects 
selected sectors of the economy or specific foreign businesses.  
  4   General trends toward liberalization and deregulation have opened up a range of 
emerging markets to FDI, but governments maintain a strong level of control over the 
economy and the activities of foreign firms. Their ever-changing policies are a source 
of both new opportunities and risk.  
  5   There are a number of sources of political risk. Among others, these include the politi-
cal philosophy of the government in power, changing economic conditions, rising 
nationalism, social unrest, terrorism, the vested interests of local business groups, and 
newly created international alliances.  
  6   There are numerous sources of information on political risk and global rankings of 
various kinds showing how countries compare. Online resources provide a quick and 
convenient way of starting a country risk analysis.  
  7   When assessing risk vulnerability at the project level quantitative and qualitative infor-
mation need to be combined in an analysis of both the investment proposition and 
the country conditions. The Weighted Country Risk Assessment Model can provide a 
framework for this. Information gaps and uncertainty will always remain but the proc-
ess can improve FDI decision making.  
  8   Country risk analyses can be incorporated into financial forecasts to produce revised 
NPV, ROI, or IRR calculations. The adjusted present value (APV) takes into account 
country risk estimates.  
  9   Understanding the policy objectives, policy tools, institutional structures and net-
works, and negotiating tactics of government agencies will help foreign managers 
negotiate better local conditions for FDI. 
 10  Power resources are the bargaining chips used by companies and governments in 
investment negotiations. 
 11   Corruption is defined by Transparency International as “the misuse of public power 
for private benefit.” It can be difficult to distinguish between corrupt practices and 
local rules of the game that stem from differences in local market structures and busi-
ness cultures. 
 12  There are three key steps in developing effective negotiating strategies. First, the MNE 
will evaluate its own position and that of the other parties to the negotiation. Second, 
the firm will examine the behavioral characteristics of the other parties in order to bet-
ter understand their style of negotiation. Third, the MNE will use this information to 
hammer out an agreement that is acceptable to both sides. Identifying the acceptance 
zone of the other party is an important step.

CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
 Yukos and the Russian oligarchs 
 Russia has been making overtures toward a free market 
economy for a considerable time. During the early 1990s 
investment from the West was seen as a way to improve 
the economy. However, significant changes needed to 
take place to reduce political risk in Russia. Initially, five 
steps were recommended by outside experts: (1) change 
the relationship between the national government and the 
republics in order to set up a federal political system in 
which central powers are limited; (2) eliminate or slash 
most state subsidies, including defence spending, and cre-
ate a uniform sales tax and personal and corporate income 
tax system; (3) establish a commercial banking system, 
boost interest rates, and create an independent bank that 
will halt current inflationary practices; (4) break up state 
monopolies and industrial cartels; and (5) free the price 
of most goods immediately and gradually add to this list 
those changes that must be phased in more slowly: energy, 
public transportation, housing, and basic consumer goods 
such as milk, bread, and meat. 
 By 1997, the private sector accounted for more than half 
of Russia’s output. Some 18,000 industrial firms had been 
privatized and over 1 million new businesses were created. 
The old Russia, its ideology and institutions, appeared to 
have gone. Despite currency and interest rate problems 
in the late 1990s, by 2001, for the first time since the end 
of communism, Russia had a balanced budget, a trade 
surplus, reserves, and a growing economy. Inward for-
eign direct investment (FDI) also surged, growing 10-fold 
between 2000 and 2009, with a peak of almost $80 billion 
in 2008. It jumped again in 2011, with high investments by 
firms like BP and Pepsi. 
 But foreign investors in Russia have learned to be cau-
tious. Government bureaucracy, endemic corruption and 
periodic interference in the economy by political leaders, 
including a habit of re-nationalizing assets in particular 
industries, have proved to be enduring characteristics of 
the country. The practice of giving preferential treatment 
for oligarchs, the powerful individuals that span the politi-
cal and business worlds also continues. This biased sys-
tem, where the state uses an administrative mechanism, 
rather than a market one, to distribute assets, property, 
and commercial opportunities to powerful individuals in 
return for their political support, was favored by Yeltsin. 
President Vladimir Putin came to power promising to end it 
but has a tendency to slide back into these old ways. 
 The turbulent history of Yukos, Russia’s largest oil com-
pany provides an interesting example. It was privatized 
in the 1990s along with a number of government-owned 
utilities and natural resource companies. These included 
Sibneft, the oil company in which the flamboyant Roman 
Abramovich had the major shareholding, and the source 
of the wealth with which he bought the English soccer club 
Chelsea. Other well-connected individuals made fortunes 
from the sell-offs, which were generally well below market 
prices. Some channeled surplus funds offshore, including 
the head of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. A US investor, 
Kenneth Dart, who had unwisely bought stakes in Yukos’s 
production subsidiaries, lost many millions of dollars as 
Mr. Khodorkovsky stripped their assets and siphoned 
money into offshore accounts. 
 Putin appeared to be both trying to stem the flows of capital 
from these previously state-owned enterprises and to trans-
fer power to his own favored oligarchs. As Mr. Khodorkovsky’s 
political ambitions grew he was sent to jail on flimsy charges 
of tax evasion in 2000. The Russian state subsequently seized 
a large stake in Yukos, its Yuganskneftegaz subsidiary, which 
represented 60 percent of its oil production capacity, appar-
ently to pay some of Yukos’s unpaid taxes. It then sold this for 
$9.35 billion, well below market value, to the Baikal Finance 
Group in December 2004. It then emerged that the Rosneft, a 
state-owned oil company headed by Igor Sechin, a close con-
fidant of Mr. Putin, had bought Baikal for an undisclosed sum. 
So the state had taken back Khodorkovsky’s prime asset by 
the back door. A close advisor to Putin, Andrei Illarionov, 
said at the time that this constituted “expropriation of private 
property” and should take the prize for the “swindle of the 
year.” He has since lost his job. 
 Around this time Putin also directed the Russian govern-
ment to limit foreign firms’ involvement in a range of indus-
tries for “strategic” reasons. In early 2005 the Ministry of 
Natural Resources stated that foreign groups and Russian 
companies with more than 49 percent foreign ownership 
would be banned from participating in tenders to exploit 
oil and metal deposits. Officials argued, for example, that 
Siemens, the German industrial giant, should be barred 
from buying a stake in Power Machines Engineering 
Company, on national security grounds. It just so happens 
that a company controlled by one of Russia’s most power-
ful and Putin-friendly oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska, expressed 
a strong interest at the same time. 
 Illarionov’s verdict was that Russia had shifted, regret-
tably, to “an interventionist model of economic development, 
with extremely incompetent intervention in economic life by 
state officials.” While the Kremlin still argues for entry into

 Problems with ports 
 Ports are important. Despite the shift to services and 
intangibles, trade in physical goods has continued to grow 
significantly. Today, over 7 billion tons of seaborne trade 
flows through the world’s ports each year. Ports are also 
the location of some of the commonest types of political 
risk, from organized, government-connected cartels to 
petty corruption. Here we briefly compare and contrast the 
problems of two port systems in two countries separated 
by huge economic, political, and cultural differences as 
well as thousands of miles: Japan and Kenya. 
 Japan’s ports have long been slower and more expen-
sive than any other in the Asia region. At the end of the 
1990s, when the problem was at its worst, it took three to 
four days to clear customs and immigration in a Japanese 
port and cost $36,000 to $40,000 to unload a vessel, 
compared to one day in most other ports and $11,000 in 
Singapore and $16,000 in the United States. Partly as a 
result of this lack of competitiveness Kobe, for example, 
was the third-largest port in the world in 1978, in terms 
of container volume handled, and by 2002 it had fallen 
to number 27, below not just Hong Kong, Singapore, 
and Pusan, but even Rotterdam and Antwerp. By 2009 it 
was 42nd in the world. A key reason for these problems 
lies in the near-monopoly power of the Japan Harbor 
Transportation Association (JHTA). At its height the JHTA 
was a cartel of 2,000 member organizations encompass-
ing the waterfront services (stevedoring, cargo handling, 
and transfer documentation) across 130 ports in Japan. It 
was run by Chairman Takashima, the so-called king of the 
waterfront, eight vice chairmen, and 85 directors from the 
various port companies. The JHTA was (and continues to 
be) responsible for two kinds of anti-competitive practices. 
 REAL CASE 
First, the system of prior consultations between shipping 
companies and the labor unions of cargo-handling com-
panies takes place via JHTA. Foreign firms cannot select 
which firm handles their cargo on the basis of quality or 
cost; JHTA chooses for them. It also controls schedule 
changes, changes in berths and route calls, centrally 
regulating and slowing down the entire process. There 
is no formal documentation, application, or appeals pro-
cedure; the system operates through informal lobbying. 
Second, licensing requirements for technical operators 
and stevedoring firms act as barriers to foreign firms 
(and to non-cartel Japanese firms) entering the market. 
Foreign firms cannot perform stevedoring or port services 
for themselves or appoint third parties without the con-
sent of JHTA. 
 The JHTA connects both government departments and 
 yakuza  (mafia-like groups in Japan) in ways that non-
Japanese cannot easily understand. A US Embassy study

CHAPTER 15 POLITICAL RISK AND NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
found that 110 ex-officials from the Ministry of Transport 
had moved to senior management positions in waterfront 
companies over the previous decade. This is  amakudari 
(literally, “descent from heaven”), a system of second-
ment or “semi-retirement” for bureaucrats common in 
Japan. The  yakuza  have also long had strong interests 
in stevedoring firms and exert an influence over all the 
constituencies.  
 Foreign pressure grew on Japan to change the anti- 
competitive ports practices through the 1990s. The 
European Commission took Japan to the World Trade 
Organization and US firms lobbied via their Chamber of 
Commerce in Tokyo. Finally in April 1997 the US Federal 
Maritime Committee imposed port sanctions on Japanese 
ships entering the United States in retaliation for restrictive 
practices in Japanese ports. A penalty of $100,000 per US 
port entry by a Japanese ship from abroad was imposed. 
Japanese port workers subsequently went on strike and 
Takashima personally (sidestepping the Japanese gov-
ernment entirely) threatened the US administration with 
counter-penalties! By November the situation was diffused 
and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed an 
agreement with the Japanese authorities with a package 
of solutions. 
 A sure sign of the power of cartels and the difficulties of 
unwinding the complex relationships between the govern-
ment and the private sector in Japan (and many countries) 
is the fact that Japanese ports are still as costly, slow, and 
uncompetitive as they were in the 1990s. In January 2005 
the Japanese government again promised to take meas-
ures to reduce the cost of using its main ports by 30 to 
40 percent to “arrest a dramatic drop in competitiveness.” 
However, the anti-competitive networks described above 
still persist as a symbol of the socio-political nature of this 
sector in Japan. 
 Kenya’s main port of Mombasa is a world away from Kobe 
or Japan. Different problems concern port users including, 
according to one study, security and theft; bureaucratic 
forwarding and clearing procedures (cost increases due 
to procedural delays); customs and excise harassment 
(leading to corruption, otherwise further delays); obsolete, 
poorly maintained port handling and lifting equipment 
(leading to further delays); high tariffs for poor service; and 
just plain corruption, in that order. 
 As with many other service operations either currently 
or previously owned or regulated by government agen-
cies in less developed countries, what they do, how they 
do it, and how much it costs is highly dependent on gov-
ernment influence. Many of Africa’s problems are seen 
to stem from a generic “culture of corruption.” Many 
forms of corruption exist in Kenya including petty cor-
ruption (to obtain a small service or get it done faster), 
corruption by harassment (where the private sector is 
harassed into bribing), political corruption (soliciting 
bribes for favors), and grand-scale corruption (evading 
tax on a grand scale or fixing government tenders worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars). Political interference 
in Kenya’s ports takes a number of forms. Particularly 
important are: 
 1    Political appointments to key management functions, 
resulting in unqualified and sometimes corrupt 
personnel in critical power positions.   
 2    Political undercurrents in labor recruitment; tribal 
affiliations and ruling political party affinity lead to 
biases in the recruitment of low-wage labor as well as 
more senior posts.   
 3    Regular interference in tender allocations; for 
government-related tenders, kickbacks (bribes) are 
necessary to win contracts.   
 4    Well-connected port users have an advantage and 
can queue-jump or get better services or security 
protection, creating frustration for other port users.    
 Beyond these kinds of problems, small-scale corrup-
tion is rife. Port users may need to bribe petty officials to 
release goods or pay security guards protection money 
to avoid theft (which they can often be responsible for). 
The uncertainty for foreign managers unfamiliar with 
these local rules of the game is increased by the constant 
change in key officials and their political affiliations. 
Moreover, bribing the wrong person not only is a waste 
of money, but also can create big problems for anyone 
caught “playing the game” during sporadic government 
crack-downs.

contains a variable that it calls “Mentality” in its formula for 
national risk assessment. The idea behind inclusion of this 
concept is that there can be a national attitude, a mentality 
that would be resistant or corrosive to foreign investment 
and prevent efficient and productive investment and business 
operations. Details about the criteria and methodology used

  Objectives of the chapter 
 This chapter discusses the opportunities and problems that face 
multinational enterprises (MNEs) because they operate in a 
multicurrency, segmented-market world. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Compare  and  contrast  how polycentric, ethnocentric, and 
geocentric solutions are used in determining the financial planning 
and controlling authority that is given to subsidiaries.  
 2  Study  some of the most common techniques that are used in 
managing global cash flows, including funds positioning and 
multilateral netting.  
 3  Examine  foreign exchange risk strategies that are used to protect 
the multinational against transaction, translation, and economic 
exchange risks.  
 4  Explain  how capital budgeting is carried out in a multinational firm.  
 5  Describe  how international financing opportunities for an MNE 
differ from those available to a domestic firm.  
 6  Provide  examples of international financial strategies currently 
being used by multinationals.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 By the early 2000s there were only four major airlines 
in the United States: American, Continental, Delta, and 
United. All faced financial difficulties due to rising oil prices 
and other costs. Other US airlines were smaller carriers 
(for example, Southwest) and were also facing significant 
financial problems. Throughout the 1990s, British Airways 
(BA) had been seeking to merge with a US airline to create 
a giant transatlantic alliance. In mid-1992, BA announced 
it was entering an arrangement with USAir (the former 
name of US Airways) that would have allowed passengers 
to travel throughout Europe and the United States by rely-
ing on just one carrier: BA/USAir. The alliance would have 
coordinated ticket pricing, catering, advertising, and the 
network of flights and connections. The major US airlines 
asked the US government to block this arrangement 
because it gave too much of the US market to a foreign 
company. After failed negotiations with the US and British 
governments, BA decided instead to hold a 24.6 percent 
minority of the voting shares in USAir. The US restricts 
foreign ownership of voting shares in an airline to 25 percent. 
 In 1997, BA announced it would sell its share of USAir 
and instead seek an alliance with American Airlines (AA). 
The proposed alliance would have allowed BA and AA to 
code-share, coordinate routes and schedules, and inte-
grate frequent flyer programs. Rival US airlines denounced 
the move, claiming it would reduce competition and allow 
the alliance a large share of the transatlantic traffic. To 
allow the alliance to continue, EU antitrust authorities 
demanded the alliance give up 267 weekly slots in London’s 
Heathrow, or 10 percent of their total. BA/AA refused to 
do this, claiming it would hamper their competitiveness. 
The two airlines’ cooperative efforts were thus reduced to 
their mutual participation in the One World international 
alliance. 
 A very interesting financial issue arises in this context: 
if BA were permitted to go all the way to merge with or 
acquire American, how would it finance the acquisition? 
This step would most likely cost more than US $10 bil-
lion to BA. The funding probably could be accomplished 
partially by the issuance of new shares in BA to existing 
shareholders of AA—but a significant amount of the fund-
ing would need to be raised in international markets. This 
issue was moot for the moment, until opposition to further 
links between these two airlines could be removed. 
 Four years after their initial proposal, BA/AA once 
again tried to win antitrust immunity. In 2001 the two air-
lines approached regulators, claiming that a new set of 
factors had emerged to support their case. These factors 
included the continued expansion of Open Skies agree-
ments between the United States and many European 
nations that had increased competition; the emergence 
of international alliances that provide global networks; 
the relative decrease in Heathrow’s European dominance 
as airports in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris increased 
traffic; and the development of similar alliances among 
competitors.  
 US competitors, Delta, Continental, and Northwest, once 
again asked the US Department of Transportation to hold 
a judicial hearing, arguing that most of the concerns were 
the same as in 1996 and that the case must be evaluated 
by an independent arbiter. Ironically, two of the three com-
panies opposing the deal have similar deals of their own 
with other European carriers. The Delta–Air France and 
KLM–Northwest alliances are very similar to what BA/AA 
proposed. Why then all the fuss over another alliance? Back 
in 2004, BA is the largest European airline with $14.8 billion 
in revenues and serves 550 destinations in 94 countries. 
AA is the second-largest airline in the United States with 
$18.7 billion in revenues in 2004 and serves 250 destina-
tions in 40 countries. The alliance would create a dominant 
company with control over transatlantic flights. BA and AA 
each have 263 and 273 US–Europe flights respectively and, 
between them, they control 38 percent of Heathrow’s slots. 
 In Europe, the UK’s Office of Fair Trading and the 
European Commission’s Competition Directorate examined

CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
the proposal. The loudest opposition by a competitor came 
from the UK’s Virgin Atlantic. News of the proposal resur-
rected Virgin’s No Way BA/AA campaign. Virgin contended 
that BA/AA would hold 60 percent of all Heathrow–US ser-
vices and fly 50 percent of all passengers traveling between 
the United States and the UK. Together, BA/AA flew 9 mil-
lion passengers between the UK and the United States 
in 2001; the next biggest carrier flew 3.5 million. Virgin 
claimed that this dominance would effectively eliminate 
smaller airlines from the transatlantic market. 
 At the center of the proposal was BA’s access to the US 
market and US carriers’ access to London’s Heathrow. 
Presently, BA flies to 25 US airports but it cannot pick up 
passengers in one US city to fly them to another US city. If the 
deal with AA had gone through, BA/AA would have had total 
access to the US and EU markets. US carriers had the oppo-
site problem. Only two US airlines, American and United, had 
access to Heathrow Airport. For years the US and British 
governments have been negotiating an Open Skies agree-
ment without much progress. The proposed alliance added 
momentum to Open Skies. The British government had 
indicated that it would be willing to negotiate an Open Skies 
agreement if the BA/AA was granted antitrust immunity. 
 In 2002, the US government approved the merger 
of BA and AA on condition that the merged company 
surrender over 200 slots in Heathrow Airport. Both airlines 
announced that they would not merge due to the excessive 
strategic cost imposed by regulators. The “final” result of 
the discussions and negotiations by 2005 was to leave BA 
and AA in the One World alliance, with code sharing, and 
with occasional expansion of routes to additional pairs of 
US–UK cities—but not a merger of the two airlines, and 
not the full access that they requested which would have 
virtually monopolized the UK–US air traffic. (Open Skies 
came into effect in April 2008 but with no BA/AA alliance.). 
 For the year ended in March 31, 2009, BA reported 
$15.168 billion in revenues and had a workforce of 44,987 
employees. AA’s revenue was $19.917 billion, 14 percent 
and 16 percent lower, respectively, compared to a year 
earlier.

Is the BA/AA alliance going to use a polycentric, ethnocentric, or geocentric solution to handling 
operations?   
 2 
If the two carriers were to complete a merger and the US dollar then weakens against the British 
pound as it did in 2004–2005, how will this affect the financial statements of the company?

If BA believed that the British pound was going to appreciate in relation to the euro, how is it likely to 
deal with receivables and payables?

Assuming that BA might choose to acquire all or part of American, United, or Delta Airlines in the 
United States, how could BA finance the major capital budgeting need in international markets, and 
what are some of the important considerations in choosing among alternative financing sources?     
 Any ﬁ rm with afﬁ liates in at least two countries (even with a simple sales ofﬁ ce abroad) 
needs to deal with differences in the ﬁ nancial environments of those countries—differences 
in their tax systems, their currency systems, and numerous other areas. Can you imagine 
trying to keep the books of a company such as Johnson & Johnson, which is required to 
maintain ﬁ nancial records according to the different accounting standards in the dozens of 
countries where it operates, plus records for use in internal control? Beyond the chores of 
record keeping, the ﬁ rm operating at this level obtains opportunities to transfer funds (and 
products) between countries, utilize ﬁ nancial markets in each country to serve its global 
needs, and diversify its risks internationally. Increasing numbers of MNEs, such as Ford and

General Electric, are building internal ﬁ nancial institutions so that they can take advantage 
of these opportunities around the world. This chapter explores the opportunities and prob-
lems of ﬁ rms in such an environment.  
 National financial markets and the euromarkets were discussed in  Chapter 7 ; here the 
emphasis is on using these markets to optimize the financial position of the multinational 
firm. The issue of transaction exchange risk was treated in  Chapter 7 ; this chapter con-
siders such risk in the context of a firm that does repeated international business and 
maintains long-term assets abroad. Finally, we consider the full set of financial issues in 
a firm whose subsidiaries in different countries compete for use of the available financial 
resources. This chapter treats the topic of multinational financial management as a whole. 
 The chapter is structured to cover major issues in corporate finance as they apply to the 
international context. Basic financial management can be divided into two broad headings: 
(1) choice and management of  sources  of funds; and (2) choice and management of  uses of 
funds. At the international level, exchange risk management must be added.  Figure  16.1 
depicts the topics that constitute the substance of the chapter. Overall financial manage-
ment requires  control  over each type of decision depicted in the figure, especially since 
financial managers in each affiliate may make decisions that affect the total corporation’s 
financial position. 
 In the next section, we explore aspects of the parent–subsidiary financial relationship 
within the MNE. Then the discussion turns to the issue of managing cash flows in the 
MNE. Next, we consider a more comprehensive presentation of exchange risk manage-
ment than that given in  Chapter 7 . After that, we look at the two sides of financial man-
agement in the context of the MNE: namely, use of available funds (particularly for capital 
budgeting) and financing for the firm’s short- and long-term needs. A section on control 
of the financial activities in an MNE follows. And finally, some strategic considerations for 
the firm in international finance are presented.

 Geocentric solution 
 A decision-making 
framework in which 
financial decisions and 
evaluation related to foreign 
affiliates are integrated for 
the firm on a global basis    
 Because ﬁ nance is such an important area of operations, it is critically important that parent 
companies ﬁ rmly establish the relationships that will exist regarding ﬁ nancial planning and 
control authority. On the one hand, each branch or subsidiary should be responsible for its 
own planning and control system. On the other hand, there must be some central control 
in order to coordinate overall operations and to ensure both efﬁ ciency and proﬁ tability. In 
addressing this challenge, MNEs tend to opt for one of three managerial solutions: poly-
centric, ethnocentric, or geocentric, just as these choices are used in other strategic areas. 
 Polycentric solution 
 A  polycentric solution   is to treat the MNE as a holding company and to decentralize de-
cision making to the subsidiary levels. In this arrangement ﬁ nancial statements are prepared 
according to generally accepted accounting principles in both the overseas subsidiary’s and 
the parent’s home country, and the subsidiary’s performance is evaluated against that of 
similar domestic and foreign concerns.  
 The advantages of the polycentric approach are those commonly obtained with decen-
tralization. Decisions are made on the spot by those most informed about market con-
ditions, and international subsidiaries tend to be more flexible, motivated, efficient, and 
competitive. On the other hand, this solution reduces the authority of the home office, and 
senior corporate management often dislikes this dilution of its authority. Additionally, an 
MNE may find that a polycentric approach results in competition between different inter-
national subsidiaries and lowers overall profits for the company.  
 Ethnocentric solution 
 The  ethnocentric solution   is to treat all foreign operations as if they were extensions of 
domestic operations. In this case each unit is integrated into the planning and control sys-
tem of the parent company. 
 The advantage of this system is that management is able to coordinate overall oper-
ations carefully. This usually results in centralization of the finance function so that cash 
not needed for day-to-day operations can be invested in marketable securities or transferred 
to other subsidiaries or branches that need   working capital  . The primary drawback of this 
solution is that it can cause problems for the individual subsidiary, which may feel that it 
needs more cash than is left on hand or that it is hindered in its efforts to expand because 
the parent company is siphoning off necessary resources. 
 Geocentric solution 
 The  geocentric solution   is to handle ﬁ nancial planning and controlling decisions on a 
global basis. These decisions are typically inﬂ uenced by two factors. One is the nature and 
location of the subsidiary. For example, British investment in North America has pre-
dominantly been via holding companies, the polycentric approach, since the quality of 
local management largely rewards decentralization. Conversely, investment in developing 
countries has typically been more centralized, with the parent company maintaining close 
control of ﬁ nancial expenditures. The second inﬂ uencing factor is the gains that can be 
achieved by coordinating all units in a carefully synchronized way. When an MNE’s over-
seas units face a myriad of tax rates, ﬁ nancial systems, and competitive environments, it is 
often more efﬁ cient to centralize most of the ﬁ nancial control decisions because this is the

best way to ensure that proﬁ t and efﬁ ciency are maximized. For example, if two subsidiaries 
are equally able to sell a particular product to a major customer, with centralized ﬁ nancial 
planning the parent company could ensure that the sale would be made by the unit located 
in the country with the lowest corporate income tax rate. Additional examples of the ways 
in which ﬁ nancial operations could be directed by using a geocentric solution are seen in 
the management of global cash ﬂ ows.

Is the BA/AA alliance going to use a polycentric, ethnocentric, or geocentric 
solution for handling operations? 
 The alliance is going to use a geocentric solution to handle operations. This is clear from 
the way in which the two air carriers are beginning to merge their operations so that they 
are both working in harmony. An alliance of equals, BA/AA can capitalize on their indi-
vidual regional/triad strengths.   
 One of the key areas of international ﬁ nancial management is the careful handling of global 
cash ﬂ ows. There are a number of ways in which this is done. Three of the most important 
ones include the prudent use of internal funds ﬂ ows, the use of funds positioning, and the 
use of  multilateral netting . The following sections examine each of these three. 
 Internal funds flows 
 When an MNE wants to expand operations or fund activities, one of the simplest ways 
of obtaining the needed monies is by getting them from internal sources such as working 
capital, which is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. For example, 
if General Electric’s German subsidiary wants to hire more employees, it may be able to pay 
for this payroll increase out of the funds it generates from ongoing operations. Another way 
of raising money internally is by borrowing from a local bank or from the parent company. 
For example, an MNE’s Chilean subsidiary will get a loan from the parent company or the 
German subsidiary and then repay the money with interest out of operations. A third way 
is by having the parent company increase its equity capital investment in the subsidiary. In 
turn the subsidiary could pay the parent dividends on the investment. These examples are 
illustrated in  Figure   16.2    and help to show that there are many ways for multinational ﬁ rms 
to generate internal cash for operations. 
 Which method is most likely to be used? The answer will depend on a number of fac-
tors, including government regulations regarding intercompany lending. For example, 
when tax rates are high for a profitable subsidiary, it is common to find those units willing 
to lend money at low rates of interest to other subsidiaries in the MNE that need funds 
to expand into growth markets. The logic behind this strategy is quite simple: the highly 
profitable unit does not need to charge a high interest rate because much of this interest 
earning will be lost to the high local taxes. Conversely, the subsidiary that is borrowing 
the money needs low interest rates so as to conserve its cash for expansion purposes.

503
CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
By shifting the money around in this fashion, the MNE is able to support expansion efforts, 
to minimize taxes, and to increase the sales potential of the subsidiaries. In an effort to 
prevent multinationals from taking advantage of such tax loopholes, in recent years some 
governments have changed their tax laws and established a minimum rate that can be 
charged on these intercompany loans. 
 Another area of concern is government limits on a parent company’s ability to charge 
subsidiaries a licensing or royalty fee for the use of technology or to assess a management 
fee that covers the subsidiary’s fair share of corporate overhead. When there are no gov-
ernment restrictions in these areas, the MNE has greater freedom in drawing funds from 
subsidiary operations, thus providing the parent with a pool of money that can be used for 
other worldwide operations. The ways in which this is done are commonly referred to as 
funds positioning techniques. 
 Funds positioning techniques 
 Funds positioning techniques   are strategies that are used to move monies from one mul-
tinational operation to another. While there are a variety of approaches, three of the most 
common are transfer pricing, use of tax havens, and fronting loans. 
 Transfer pricing 
 A  transfer price   is an internal price that is set by a company in intraﬁ rm trade such as 
the price at which the Chilean subsidiary will purchase electric motors from the German 
subsidiary. An initial conclusion would be that the German ﬁ rm will sell the motors at the 
same price as it would to any outside purchaser. A second conclusion is that the Chilean 
subsidiary will receive a discount because it is an intraﬁ rm transaction and the parent will 
not allow its subsidiaries to proﬁ t at the expense of each other. However, both of these con-
clusions are incorrect when a transfer pricing strategy is employed. The ﬁ nal price will be 
determined by local regulations and will be set at a level that allows the MNE to achieve cer-
tain desired goals such as to increase proﬁ t, to reduce costs, and/or to move money among 
the subsidiaries.  
 A good example is provided by a multinational that has a subsidiary located in Country 
A, which has a low corporate income tax and is selling goods to a subsidiary located in 
Country B, which has a high corporate income tax. If the transfer price is set carefully, it 
is possible to reallocate taxable income away from the highly taxed subsidiary to the sub-
sidiary with the low tax rate.  Table   16.1    provides an example by contrasting arm’s-length 
pricing with transfer pricing. An  arm’s-length price   is the price a buyer will pay for mer-
chandise in a market under conditions of perfect competition. As seen in the table, it cost 
the subsidiary in Country A $8,000 for the goods it is selling to the subsidiary in Country B.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
Under an arm’s-length price the seller is adding $2,000 for profit and selling the goods for 
$10,000. In turn the second subsidiary is selling these goods for $12,000. Thus both sub-
sidiaries are making a profit of $2,000. As also seen in the table, the tax rate in Country A 
is 40 percent, whereas in Country B it is 50 percent. So the first subsidiary will have a net 
profit of $1,200, whereas the second subsidiary will net $1,000.  
 Under a transfer price arrangement, however, the objective is to maximize profits in 
the-low-tax rate country and to minimize them in the high-tax-rate country. In this case, 
as seen in  Table   16.1   , the first subsidiary sells the goods for $12,000, and after paying 
40 percent tax on the $4,000 profit, it ends up with a net profit of $2,400. The second sub-
sidiary sells the goods for $12,000 and makes no profit. However, thanks to the transfer 
pricing strategy, the multinational’s overall profit is greater than it was with arm’s-length 
pricing ($2,400 versus $2,200).  
 Note that taxes are not the only considerations. Import tariffs also influence the decision 
to use transfer pricing. If the importing country has high tariffs, the firm needs to consider 
whether a high or low transfer price will maximize after-tax, after-tariff profits. 
 One of the obvious benefits of transfer pricing is that it allows the multinational to 
reduce taxes. A second benefit is that the strategy lets the firm concentrate cash in specific 
locales such as with the first subsidiary, or to move funds away from a country facing sig-
nificant exchange rate risk, or to reduce payment of import tariffs. One of the problems 
with transfer pricing is that the financial statements do not accurately reflect subsidiary 
performance because the profit margins are manipulated. A second problem is that the 
strategy may not encourage efficient performance by the seller in a low-tax jurisdiction, 
whose primary objective is to unload merchandise on the other subsidiary at a profit as 
high as can be justified. 
 In recent years countries have been rewriting their tax codes to prevent arbitrary trans-
fer pricing. In the United States, for example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) now asks 
multinationals to apply for an advanced determination ruling before establishing a transfer 
pricing policy. After the firm submits the request, the IRS will determine whether or not 
the policy is appropriate. The objective of the tax agency is to ensure that MNEs charge 
their overseas subsidiaries the same price for components and products as they charge 
independent third parties, thus effectively eliminating price manipulation for tax purposes. 
Because a large part (about one-third) of international trade in the early twenty-first cen-
tury is intrafirm, transfer prices are a necessary aspect of much of international business.  
  Use of tax havens 
 A second funds positioning technique is the use of   tax havens , which are low-tax countries 
that are hospitable to business (see accompanying map). This strategy is typically used in 
conjunction with transfer pricing and involves a subsidiary selling its output at a very low 
cost to a subsidiary in a tax haven, which in turn sells the merchandise at a very high price 
to a third subsidiary. 1   Table   16.2    provides an example, which is similar to that in  Table   16.1   , 
except that the sales are now routed through a subsidiary located in a tax haven, Country B,

where no tax is paid at all. The result of the example in the table is a net proﬁ t of $4,000. 
This is greater than that illustrated in  Table  16.1 , where a simple case of transfer pricing 
was employed. For more on the matter of tax havens, see the case  International Business 
Strategy in Action: Tax havens . 
 Fronting loans 
 A  fronting loan   is a funds positioning strategy that involves having a third party manage 
the loan. For example, if a US multinational decided to set up operations in China, the 
MNE might be concerned with the political risk that accompanies such a decision. Is it 
possible that the government might expropriate the subsidiary’s assets, including all the 
cash on hand? In an effort to protect its investments, the parent company could deposit 
funds with a major international bank that has strong ties to China and is on good terms 
with the government. In turn the subsidiary would apply for a loan with this bank and the 
multinational company’s deposit would be given to the subsidiary in the form of a loan. It is 
highly unlikely that the Chinese government would expropriate the subsidiary and endan-
ger the loan or its relationship with the international bank. Thus the MNE has successfully 
positioned its funds. 
 Funds positioning strategies are important in moving money around a multinational, 
as well as in helping the MNE to cope with political and legal roadblocks that stand in the 
way of such action. However, an internally operated netting process that controls the flow 
of funds and ensures that bills are paid promptly always complements these strategies. This 
process is often collectively referred to as multilateral netting.   
 Multilateral netting 
 When subsidiaries do business with each other, each may owe money to the others and in 
turn be owed money by them.  Figure   16.3    provides an example of four subsidiaries that 
have both amounts due and amounts payable from each of the others. Over time, of course,

these obligations will be resolved by the individual subsidiaries. In an effort to make the 
process more efﬁ cient, however, many multinationals have now set up   clearing accounts 
in a certain location and assigned the manager at this location the authority to make 
the transfers that are necessary to pay intracompany subsidiary obligations. This process 
of multilateral netting, which involves a determination of the net amount of money 
owed to subsidiaries through multilateral transactions, begins with a computation of the 
amounts owed to each.  Table   16.3   , which has been constructed based on the information 
in  Figure   16.3   , shows these net positions. Based on this information, those that owe money 
are required to transfer it to a centralized clearing account (see  Figure   16.4   ), whereas those 
that are owed money are paid from this central account. 
 The clearing account manager is responsible for seeing that this process occurs quickly 
and correctly. Typically, this manager will receive monthly transaction information from 
all the subsidiaries and will use these data to determine the net position of each unit. The 
manager will then see that the necessary transfers are made. These transfers usually take 
place in the currency of the payer, so the German subsidiary will pay its obligation in euros, 
whereas the Mexican subsidiary will pay in pesos. The clearing account manager’s staff will 
handle the process. 
Note: No jurisdiction is currently listed as an uncooperative tax haven by the OECD’s Committee on Fiscal Affairs according to 
the progress report as at January 4, 2011.

CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
 Figure 16.4  Centralized netting process in action 
 There are a number of reasons that multilateral netting has become popular. One advan-
tage is that it helps the parent company to ensure that financial interactions between the 
units are quickly brought to completion. If bills are allowed to be outstanding for months 
at a time, it can result in the other units not wanting to do business with slow-paying sub-
sidiaries. Netting helps to reduce the likelihood of such problems. A second advantage is 
that those units that are owed money have faster access to their funds. A third advantage is 
that the parent company knows which subsidiaries are amassing large amounts of cash and 
can tap these sources if necessary to support activities in other locales. A fourth advantage 
is that the cost of converting foreign exchange is minimized because the central clearing 
account manager can convert large amounts at the same time.  
 There are also some problems associated with multilateral netting. One is that 
many governments place controls on these operations by allowing them only for trade 

508
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Tax havens 
 What do Switzerland, the Bahamas, Monaco, and Andorra 
have in common? By some definition, they are all consid-
ered to be tax havens. In general, a tax haven is a country 
or a jurisdiction that allows individuals or corporations to 
set up a subsidiary and to avoid paying taxes in their country 
of residence, thus depriving their home governments of 
some tax revenues that are used to provide government 
services. 
 One of the underlying problems that led to the creation 
of tax havens in the first place is that there is no single 
international tax standard. Individual governments have 
different tax policies, so MNEs have an incentive to deploy 
their overall financial assets around their worldwide net-
work of subsidiaries in order to minimize taxation. It would 
not be possible for MNEs to do this if there were a com-
mon unitary world tax system. The MNEs are reacting to 
the lack of a global standard in government tax policy, yet 
governments then blame them for using legal tax havens 
to reduce overall taxes paid. 
 Each tax haven jurisdiction has its own sets of laws on 
taxation and transparency. Tax havens are also some-
times accused by governments and NGOs such as Oxfam 
as being a means for money laundering and of hiding the 
proceeds of criminal activity, including political corruption, 
illicit arms dealing, and drug trafficking. In fact, these are 
serious concerns, and each of the tax haven jurisdictions 
has taken significant steps in recent years to reduce the 
possibility of being used for these purposes. 
 The OECD lists a number of factors used to identify 
a tax haven. Among these, a tax haven is a country or 
jurisdiction that: (1) imposes no or nominal taxes and is 
used by foreigners to escape taxes in their own countries 
(this includes “ring-fencing” jurisdictions that reserve 
preferential treatment to foreigners, thus shielding the 
country from tax avoidance by its own residents); (2) has 
laws or administrative practices that prevent the exchange 
of information with other governments on taxpayers ben-
efiting from low taxation; (3) lacks transparency; and 
(4) does not require substantial productive operations 
in the country, suggesting policies geared to attracting 
income only on a preferential tax basis. Of all these fac-
tors, only the first one is necessary for the identification of 
a tax haven. 
 In recent years, the OECD has been pressuring countries 
and jurisdictions to reverse what it calls harmful tax 
competition and lack of transparency. The United Nations, 
for different reasons, has been trying to curb the use of 
tax havens for money laundering. The EU has also chal-
lenged the use of unfair tax competition by US exporters 
in the World Trade Organization and won. Under US law, 
US exporters could set up a sales operation in an offshore 
tax haven and avoid paying taxes on the proceeds of this 
business. The British and French governments have also 
each targeted their own tax haven jurisdictions, the British 
challenging the Channel Islands and Isle of Man offshore 
tax havens. 
 Reluctantly, many of these countries have reacted to 
OECD pressures and reformed their policies. The Channel 
Islands and the Cayman Islands both have anti-money-
laundering legislation. Under pressure from the French 
government, Monaco also signed an agreement to prevent 
money laundering, increase transparency, and remove 
some tax concessions.  
 Yet the total eradication of tax havens will not come 
without confrontation. For one, tax havens and their finan-
cial institutions depend heavily on these deposits. The 
Bahamas, which considers itself a 
major international financial hub, can 
foresee a tremendous loss of income, 
especially if other countries, including 
Switzerland and Luxembourg, are not 
ready to implement the same pol-
icies. The Bahamas has argued that 
the OECD is using a two-tier system, 
cooperatively designing legislation 
with its member countries and then 
imposing this regime on smaller, less 
developed, non-member countries. 
 Switzerland, for its part, is will-
ing to work out a tax reimbursement

transactions. So the MNE’s ability to use netting for moving funds can be limited. A sec-
ond problem is that in other cases governments have required that payment for imports 
be delayed until these goods clear customs, thus slowing down the netting process by as 
much as 60 to 90 days. A third is that of getting local subsidiary managers to cooperate and 
keep the central clearing account manager fully apprised of all transactions affecting this 
process. Sometimes there is a reluctance to cooperate on the part of those managers whose 
cash outflows are substantially larger than their inflows. Under a netting process they can 
no longer delay payments for three or four months while working to reverse the flow and 
to pay their bills out of current earnings. 
 Multilateral netting can help an MNE to ensure that intersubsidiary accounts are 
 balanced, and the process is extremely useful in assisting the parent company in manag-
ing global cash flows. However, there is an inherent problem in this process that requires 
special attention and which netting cannot resolve: foreign exchange risk as typified by 
the fluctuating value of international currencies. This risk is particularly important when 
MNEs do business with buyers who are paying in weak currencies. In dealing with this 
dilemma, MNEs often formulate a foreign exchange risk management strategy. 
 Managing cash 
 Consider a multinational ﬁ rm such as Nestlé (based in Switzerland) whose network of af-
ﬁ liates extends around the world. Each afﬁ liate has its own customers and suppliers, as well 
as ﬁ nancial ties to the rest of the company. Viewing the company as a single unit for pur-
poses of cash management can yield far better results than would be obtained if each afﬁ li-
ate managed its cash independently. For example, much less foreign exchange protection is 
generally needed if all of the afﬁ liates are evaluated together than if each afﬁ liate   hedges its 
own position. The French subsidiary may have a large amount of accounts payable in euros 
that can be hedged simply by consolidating the German afﬁ liate’s excess cash which is also

scheme with the EU and the United States, but is not willing 
to increase its transparency. Though this might address 
the tax concerns of OECD nations, it does little to prevent 
criminal activity or to address the tax concerns of poorer 
countries, which are estimated to lose over $50 billion a 
year from tax evasion. 
 Another group opposing these reforms are MNEs that 
use tax havens. In the UK, at least one company threatened 
to move its operations if the government continued its 
attempts to prevent the use of tax havens. Despite this type 
of opposition, the OECD continues to pressure for reform. 
 In a report issued in 2000, the OECD identified a number 
of jurisdictions as tax havens according to criteria it 
had established. Between 2000 and April 2002, 31 juris-
dictions made formal commitments to implement the 
OECD’s standards of transparency and exchange of infor-
mation. Seven jurisdictions (Andorra, the Principality of 
Liechtenstein, Liberia, the Principality of Monaco, the 
Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Nauru 
and the Republic of Vanuatu) did not make commitments 
to transparency and exchange of information at that time 
and were identified in April 2002 by the OECD’s Committee 
on Fiscal Affairs as uncooperative tax havens. All of these 
jurisdictions have subsequently made commitments and 
were removed from the list of uncooperative tax havens. 
Nauru and Vanuatu made their commitments in 2003 and 
Liberia and the Marshall Islands in 2007. In May 2009, 
the Committee on Fiscal Affairs decided to remove all 
three remaining jurisdictions (Andorra, the Principality of 
Liechtenstein, and the Principality of Monaco) from the list 
of uncooperative tax havens in the light of their commit-
ments to implement the OECD standards of transparency 
and effective exchange of information and the timetable 
they set for the implementation. As a result, no jurisdic-
tion is currently listed as an uncooperative tax haven by 
the Committee on Fiscal Affairs according to the progress 
report as at January 4, 2011.

in euros. Similarly, the Canadian subsidiary may possess a large amount of Canadian dollar 
assets that can be hedged by having the US company contract some liabilities (for example, by 
purchasing equipment or taking out loans) denominated in Canadian dollars. The whole 
company may coordinate its borrowing efforts through the British subsidiary, which uses 
the London eurocurrency market. 
 Centralized cash management offers five kinds of potential gains to the MNE: 
 1   By pooling the cash holdings of affiliates where possible, the MNE can hold a smaller 
total amount of cash, thus reducing its financing needs. 
 2   By centralizing cash management, it can have one group of people specialize in the 
performance of this task, thus achieving better decisions and economies of scale.  
 3   By reducing the amount of cash in any one affiliate, it can reduce country risks as well 
as financial costs. 
 4   As noted previously, it can net out intracompany accounts when there are multiple 
payables and receivables among affiliates, thus reducing the amount of money actually 
transferred among affiliates. 
 5   Its central cash management group can ensure that cash management decisions aim at 
corporate goals rather than the goals of individual affiliates when these might conflict.   
 The first kind of gain results simply from better use of the cash held by the firm. If each 
affiliate holds enough cash to meet its transactions needs, precautionary needs, and specula-
tive needs (following the Keynesian categories of money demand), far more cash is likely to 
be held than is needed  companywide . A domestic company centralizes the cash management 
function at one location (usually the home office), and an MNE can do the same. The key dif-
ference between the two is that the MNE is often restricted in its ability to shift funds among 
affiliates internationally; thus, less centralization is possible at the MNE level. Any reduction 
in cash holdings, however, enables the firm to reduce its financing needs, thus lowering costs. 
 The second kind of gain relates to the development of management skills. By centralizing 
the cash management function, even if funds are left in the affiliates for the most part, the 
firm can utilize the skills of a specialized group of cash managers. Gains from this group’s 
decision making should include economies of scale in borrowing, since the group can bor-
row to meet the entire company’s needs and then distribute funds to affiliates as required. 
Also, the group should develop detailed knowledge of financial opportunities worldwide, 
thus enabling the firm to borrow at lower cost or lower risk than firms lacking such expertise. 
 If the MNE reduces its total assets through centralized cash management, it also reduces 
both its exchange risk and its country risk in that fewer assets are at risk worldwide. The 
country risk does not change, but the exposure of the company to that risk decreases. Country 
risk may also be hedged or transferred by the decision makers in the cash management group, 
who have greater access to protection tools than do managers in any one affiliate. 
 The fourth kind of benefit, from multilateral netting of accounts, is primarily cost sav-
ings from the reduced need to transfer funds between affiliates. 
 The fifth kind of gain from centralized cash management relates to business strategy. 
Placing the cash management function in one location, either at the home office or at a 
location closely monitored by the home office, makes better control possible. In this way, 
the firm can ensure that cash management decisions are made to meet global corporate 
needs rather than to improve an affiliate’s position, possibly at the expense of the rest of the 
company. This is especially true with respect to hedging, which should be decided at the 
corporate level, since virtually every affiliate is likely to have assets or liabilities in another 
currency that are partially or totally hedged by balance sheet items of other subsidiaries. 
 While centralized cash management offers obvious and potentially very large benefits, it 
also presents some problems. Most importantly, if freedom to manage cash is taken away 

511
CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
from the affiliate manager, some of the affiliate’s ability to improve its performance is also 
removed. The evaluation of each affiliate must recognize this point. (This idea is discussed 
further in the section on controls.) 
 Another problem with internationally centralized cash management arises when 
national rules restrict financial transfers into or out of some countries. Virtually all less 
developed countries and many developed ones limit funds outflows through exchange 
controls or taxation. Some countries specifically disallow international netting of pay-
ments. Because of such restrictions, international cash management today requires a great 
deal of knowledge about national financial constraints and often requires a decentralized 
strategy of funds transfers due to these constraints. 
 The whole idea of international funds transfer and management is a major opportunity 
for firms that have operations in multiple countries. Not only can transfer pricing, multilat-
eral netting, and so on be used to move funds as needed in the firm, but other policies such 
as dividend remittances, payment of royalties and fees, and intracompany loans are among 
the many alternatives that can be used to optimize the firm’s overall financial situation.  
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Sovereign wealth funds 
 In terms of international financial management a recent 
development illustrates the tensions between the workings 
of financial markets and the sovereignty of nations. Mainly 
due to its large and persistent balance of trade deficit, 
the United States has long been a destination for inward 
financial flows. Basically, the US trade deficit has to be 
balanced by a surplus on its capital (monetary) accounts. 
Another way of saying this is that as Americans consume 
more in imports than they export, leading to a trade deficit, 
it is necessary to sell US financial assets to foreigners. The 
end result of these financial capital inflows is that foreigners 
own more American assets.  
 For many years foreigners bought US Treasury bonds 
and other financial assets. However, as the value of the US 
dollar decreased in 2007 and 2008 the yields on US financial 
investments also started to fall. Financial assets denomi-
nated in US dollars became less valuable compared to assets 
in other currencies such as the euro. Even the Canadian dol-
lar was worth more than a US dollar in late 2007. 
 The result of the falling US dollar was that foreigners 
switched from financial investments into the US stock mar-
ket. Equity ownership of US firms became a substitute for US 
bonds for foreigners. Many US firms welcomed such foreign 
investment, even as it diluted American ownership of their 
companies. For example, some US financial institutions, such 
as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley, were bailed 
out by foreign private equity funds in early 2008. However, 
this has raised issues of sovereignty as the richest private 
equity funds are owned by governments from the Middle East 
and China. They are called sovereign wealth funds. 
 For example, one of the world’s 
richest sovereign wealth funds is 
owned by the government of Dubai. 
Previously (as reported in the case 
in  Chapter 14  on P&O, Carnival, and 
Dubai Port World) the takeover of some 
US ports by Dubai Ports was criticized 
by Senator Hillary Clinton and many of 
her colleagues in the US Congress. As 
a result of the controversy President 
Bush was forced to reopen the pro-
cess by which Dubai Ports had been 
allowed to take over the US ports pre-
viously owned by P&O. While Senator

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
Clinton argued that US ports should not be foreign owned, 
she seemed to have forgotten that these ports were 
already foreign owned since P&O is a British company. 
What she and her congressional colleagues really objected 
to was that Dubai Ports was a Middle Eastern government-
owned financial company against which discriminatory 
measures should be used. 
 Ultimately the US government can discriminate against 
foreign investors on the grounds of national security. 
In the case of US ports there is some logic to such dis-
crimination, especially in a post-9/11 world. However, it 
is difficult to apply this logic of national security to many 
of the protectionist arguments raised by labor groups 
and others opposed to foreign investment. The confusion 
arises because the large state-run private equity funds of 
the Middle East and China are seen as instruments of their 
governments. They are not seen as purely financial invest-
ment houses, although they operate in world financial mar-
kets in the same way as the banks and financial institutions 
of Western economies. 
 The control of strategic entities in the United States will 
continue to be controversial. The Dubai Ports case sparked 
discussion of whether any of the 360 US ports should be 
allowed to be operated by foreign entities. Three out of five 
terminals in New York and New Jersey, and 80 percent of 
the Port of Los Angeles, are now being operated by foreign 
firms. At the time of the controversy, only about 5 percent of 
the approximately 26,000 containers arriving daily at the US 
coasts were inspected by the US government, leaving the 
responsibility of screening the rest to companies that own 
and operate the ports. One of these companies is Denmark-
based Maersk Group, vertically integrating into port manage-
ment from its core business of vessel operation. In operating 
terminals in 12 different ports across the United States the 
company plays a part in US national security efforts.  
 This issue is also relevant in Europe, where European 
firms such as Swiss bank UBS received funds from 
the Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC). The British 
bank, Barclays, received investments from Temasek of 
Singapore. 
 The world’s largest sovereign wealth funds are reported 
in  Table   1   . The largest sovereign wealth fund is the Abu 
Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) founded in 1976, while 
Singapore’s Temasek was set up in 1974. The China 
Investment Corporation, a much newer fund, invested 
$3 billion in US buyout firm Blackstone. 
 It is not clear how the issue of sovereign equity funds will 
be resolved. At a macroeconomic level it is necessary for 
world financial and trade imbalances to be reconciled. As 
long as the United States has a large trade deficit there will 
need to be inward flows of foreign investment. If a large 
proportion of these inward flows are from private equity 
funds, then there is little that the United States can do to 
scare them away.

CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
 We have discussed exchange risk primarily in relation to  transactions  denominated in foreign 
currency. In addition, exchange risk exists in the translation of ﬁ nancial statements and, in prin-
ciple, for future, so-far unspeciﬁ ed activities of the ﬁ rm. Three kinds of exchange risk should be 
differentiated: (1) transaction risk; (2) translation risk; and (3) economic risk. Each kind of risk is 
important to the MNE, and each leads to somewhat different conclusions for hedging strategies. 
 Transaction risk 
 When a speciﬁ c contracted asset or liability is denominated in a foreign currency, it is subject 
to   transaction risk  , or the risk of an unexpected change in its home-currency value during 
the time to maturity. Accounts payable and receivable, loans, and bank deposits denomi-
nated in foreign currencies are examples of items that are subject to such exchange risk. Each 
foreign currency transaction can be hedged (or not) with some offsetting transaction in the 
same currency and with the same maturity. This topic was discussed in  Chapter 7 , and a new 
example is presented at the end of this section.  
 Translation risk 
 Translation risk  , or accounting risk, is the risk of value changes in foreign currency 
assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, whether or not the transactions occur during 
the accounting period. For example, the plant and equipment of foreign subsidiaries is 
subject to valuation change even if no purchase or sale of such items takes place during 
the accounting period. Because balance sheet information is reported in most countries to 
securities regulators and in published ﬁ nancial statements, valuation changes in the foreign 
operations of multinational ﬁ rms become public knowledge. Loss in the value of foreign 
currency assets, regardless of its impact on company earnings, may negatively affect inves-
tors’ perceptions of a ﬁ rm. To avoid the appearance of weakness due to the devaluation 
of foreign assets, ﬁ rms often try to hedge their balance sheets through ﬁ nancial contracts 
(such as forward contracts or money market hedges). 
 A good example of this exposure for a US MNE is when the currency of a local country 
weakens in relation to the dollar. For example, if the Chilean peso declined by 10 percent 
against the dollar, the value of the Chilean subsidiary’s peso account at the local bank 
would also decline when translated into dollars in the   consolidation   process. If the com-
pany had the equivalent of $100,000 (US) on deposit, this account would now be worth 
$90,000 in translation and consolidation. Of course, this decline would not affect the 
number of pesos on deposit, and the local purchasing power of these pesos, at least in the 
short run, would remain the same. However, the decline would negatively affect the sub-
sidiary’s ability to purchase imports from countries with strong currencies since it would 
now take more pesos than before to buy these goods.  
 Conclusions as to the desirability of   balance sheet hedging   are ambiguous. On the 
one hand, since investor decisions may be based on valuation changes in foreign currency 
assets, the firm should hedge to avoid investor preoccupation with such changes. On the 
other hand, since the valuation of foreign currency assets may not affect the economic 
viability of the project, it would be a waste of effort for the firm to deal with such changes.   
 Economic risk 
 Economic risk   is the risk of unexpected changes in future cash ﬂ ows from foreign operations 
(and from activities denominated in foreign currencies, wherever they occur). Such risk is most 
important to the ﬁ rm, since future cash ﬂ ows are the basis for the ﬁ rm’s value. Unfortunately 
for the manager, it is not possible to know with certainty the full set of future cash ﬂ ows that

will occur. Thus, a hedging strategy cannot be perfectly matched with such cash ﬂ ows. To deal 
with economic risk, the ﬁ rm may choose to follow a generalized strategy of hedging transac-
tions when they are contracted and trying to balance foreign currency assets and liabilities 
as they appear on the balance sheet. Or the ﬁ rm may choose not to hedge at all, on the assump-
tion that future currency ﬂ uctuation will be approximately offset by price changes in each 
country (that is, purchasing power parity will approximately hold). Despite the inherent difﬁ -
culty of predicting future foreign exchange exposures, ultimately the ﬁ rm should be concerned 
about economic (foreign exchange) risk as the key variable in exchange risk management.  
 Consider the economic risk involved with a subsidiary’s assets. If the value of the local cur-
rency strengthens, the sale of inventory will generate larger dollar profits. However, would it be 
wiser to lower the price, to take less profit per item, but to generate more demand? Similarly, 
would it be wise now to sell fixed assets such as buildings or factories and then to lease them 
back from the purchaser? Some US firms in Tokyo found that by the early 1990s the land and 
buildings that they had bought years before were now worth hundreds of times their original 
purchase price. Believing that the local real estate market was as high as it was going to go and 
feeling that it would be more advisable to sell the properties and rent them back, these firms 
sold their office buildings and made tremendous profits. The ensuing decline of Tokyo real 
estate prices showed that these firms had made very wise (lucky) decisions.       2   
 Another example of economic exposure is the risk that companies take when selling to a 
country with a weakening currency. In this case many MNEs have sought to increase their 
own production efficiency, lower their costs, and continue to generate acceptable profit. 
Firms such as Honda, Nissan, and BMW have complemented this strategy by setting up 
operations in the United States, their largest international market.       3  In the process the firms 
have reduced their economic exposure. 
 In fact, all three kinds of foreign exchange risk play important parts in the management 
of an international firm. No single hedging strategy can cover them all, so the MNE man-
ager must devise plans for dealing with each. Fortunately, both transaction and economic 
risk deal with future cash flows; thus, the management of these two kinds of risk can be 
combined fairly readily. For example, the firm can hedge all occasional exports denomi-
nated in foreign currencies and seek local-currency financing for the entire production 
of its foreign affiliates. Then, if it does not employ balance sheet hedging (as suggested 
earlier), it can follow a consistent and simple hedging strategy. Judging from the immense 
volume of material dealing with corporate foreign exchange management strategies, it is 
safe to say that MNEs generally do  not  follow such simple strategies. Instead, they combine 
some hedging with some speculation in an effort to maximize their results from foreign 
exchange dealings.  Table   16.4    lists a range of exchange risk hedging techniques that can be 
used to deal with one or more of these exchange risk categories.

 * These techniques assume no expectation about the direction of exchange rate change. If devaluation is expected, 
then creation of a net liability position is attractive, and vice versa for expected revaluation. In each instance, the 
hedge must produce an equal-value asset (liability) in the same currency with equal maturity to offset the exposed 
liability (asset). 

515
CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
  An example of exchange risk management 
 Consider the situation faced by a US-based ﬁ rm such as American Express Company 
(AMEX) when its subsidiary in the UK reports the purchase of £5 million of ofﬁ ce equip-
ment (mainly furniture and computer terminals) for the subsidiary’s tourist service ofﬁ ces 
throughout that country. This equipment is to be paid for in 180 days in British pounds. 
The strategies for dealing with exchange risk in this transaction depend on the whole ﬁ rm’s 
position in British pounds. The problem can be analyzed as follows. 
 First, if American Express already has an existing asset exposure in the UK due to its 
subsidiary’s ongoing activities, that position may partially or wholly cover the new transac-
tion. In other words, if American Express(UK) has a balance sheet that shows net sterling 
(pound) assets, typically because foreign subsidiaries have some dollar liabilities, the new 
account payable may partially offset that asset exposure. 
 Second, the same results may occur even if the British subsidiary has been operated to 
cover ongoing exchange risk in the UK. In the event that American Express has placed 
funds in euro–British pound deposits in one of its other subsidiaries (for example, in 
France or Germany), the new account payable may offset the existing exposure.  Note that 
the exposure is still not covered unless the maturity of the existing asset matches the six-month 
maturity of the new liability . 
 Third, American Express can look for some financial hedging technique to avoid the 
exchange risk. For example, some new asset such as a bank deposit or short-term security 
could be purchased with a maturity of 180 days and a value of £5 million. Or a forward 
contract could be arranged with a bank to sell dollars and buy pounds in 180 days. Through 
the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) or through one of the US 
futures exchanges, American Express could arrange a futures contract or   currency option 
contract to hedge the account payable. The alternatives are numerous, but the basic goal is 
to find some British pound asset that matures in 180 days, worth £5 million, to hedge the 
new liability that calls for a cash outflow of £5 million in 180 days. 
 The following table lists relevant financial information if American Express were mak-
ing this hedging decision on January 13, 2011:

If the two carriers were to complete their merger and the US dollar then 
weakens against the British pound, as it did in 2004–2005, how will this affect 
the financial statements of the company? 
 This will depend on whether the two carriers continue to issue separate financial state-
ments. If they do, AA’s financials will be affected only by the amount of sterling that it has 
on hand. Otherwise there will be no effect, since changes in the pound do not affect the 
cost to AA of doing business in the United States. In the case of BA the accounts payable 
that are due in dollars will negatively affect the airline’s financials. If the two carriers 
combine their statements into one, the overall effect will be a result of how these transac-
tions net out. This would be determined based on the rules in FASB (Financial Accounting 
Standards Board) Statement No. 52.

to buy is the call option 
and the right to sell is the 
put option. It allows the 
company to take advantage 
of favorable movements in 
exchange rates. Options are 
the only form of hedging 
that does this.    

516
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 American Express can use this information to evaluate various financial hedges for the 
sterling account payable. 
 First, the firm can use a simple forward contract to hedge the exposure. A forward 
exchange contract to buy British pounds would cost about US $7.8675 million in six 
months, as follows: 
 £5,000,000  US$1.57350£  US$7,867,500 
 This forward exchange contract completely hedges the account payable, because it will 
result in receipt from the bank of £5 million in 180 days, which will be used to pay the sup-
plier of ofﬁ ce equipment. 
 A second alternative is called “money market hedging.” The first step is to place funds 
now into a pound-denominated investment that matures in six months. The choice shown 
above is a eurosterling account that pays 2.1275 percent per year for the six-month period. 
The dollar value of pounds for American Express to buy today can be calculated by dis-
counting the future pounds that are needed to a present value of pounds that must be 
deposited today to achieve that sum in six months. The calculations are as follows: 
 £5,000,000(1.043003)  £4,793,850.17 
 This ﬁ rst step shows that the interest earned in the eurosterling deposit for 180 days will 
be 1.06375 percent (that is, 2.1275%/2) and that £4,793,850.17 must be deposited today to 
reach the value needed to pay the account payable. Next, the dollars that must be used today 
to buy these pounds is: 
  £4,793,850.17  US$1.57680£1  US$7,558,942.95 
 The hedging cost is lower for this alternative, since the funds must be paid  now  rather than 
in 180 days. To compare the two choices, they must be placed in the same time period. This 
requires discounting the forward contract value using the relevant discount rate, which 
would be a deposit interest rate in dollars for the same time period: 
 US$7,867,500(1.018421)  US$7,725,194.28 
 The discount amount (1.018421) is the implicit return to depositing funds in a eurodol-
lar account (comparable to the europound deposit) for six months at 0.91362 percent per 
year. This results in a lower cost of hedging in the money market hedging (US$166,251.79).  
 A third alternative is to use a futures contract hedge in the LIFFE or the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange (CME). Using the CME’s quotes, we see that American Express could 
buy future pounds for US $1.5800 per pound in contracts worth £62,500 per contract. 
Multiple contracts could be bought, so that with 80 contracts the company could obtain 
the needed £5 million. However, since the exchange rate is worse than the forward rate

CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
(that is, it costs more dollars to buy the pounds), American Express will not consider a 
futures hedge. 4 
 Each of these financial hedges can protect American Express against foreign exchange 
risk. The company will want to choose the least costly hedge in this case, namely the for-
ward market hedge. In other situations, one or another of these three alternatives will be 
the most beneficial to the firm. Beyond these choices, American Express should consider 
the possibility of structuring its business such that it could use British pound assets (for 
example, accounts receivable, investments, etc.) to hedge liabilities such as this purchase 
of equipment. 
  Developing forecasting and reporting systems 
 The management of foreign exchange risk can be both complex and cumbersome. A multi-
national with 20 subsidiaries can present a formidable challenge to the parent company 
because so many foreign exchange risk decisions need to be made and monitored. However, 
there are a number of steps that MNEs typically take in creating the necessary system for 
managing these decisions. They may: 
 1   Decide the types and degrees of economic exposure that the company is willing to 
accept. 
 2   Develop the necessary expertise (in-house personnel and/or outside economists or 
consultants) for monitoring exchange rates and for forecasting those rates that are 
applicable to the identified exposures. 
 3   Construct a reporting system that allows the firm to identify exposed accounts, to measure 
this exposure, and to feed back information on what the firm is doing and the status of 
these decisions. 
 4   Include all MNE units in this reporting system so that each better understands the risks 
it is assuming and is aware of the actions that must be taken to deal with these risks.  
 5   Keep senior-level management fully apprised of what is going on in each area of 
responsibility so that every regional or divisional manager is able periodically to revise 
the exposure risk and to make those strategy changes that will help more effectively to 
manage the process. 
 As firms begin to implement these five steps, they are better able to deal with the man-
agement of foreign exchange risk.

If BA believed that the British pound was going to appreciate in relation to the 
euro, how is it likely to deal with receivables and payables? 
 If BA believed that the pound was going to get stronger against the euro, and if it were 
owed euros, the firm would try to collect them immediately before their value declined. At 
the same time BA would delay payment of those obligations that were fixed in euros, for 
it would be getting more euros per pound after the appreciation, thus making it easier to 
pay those bills. The firm would lead collections and lag payables.   

518
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Assuming the investment made by the parent firm is 4 million in local currency, 
the project appears to have a simple return on capital of about 38 percent per year 
(1,500,000/4,000,000). As long as the firm’s cost of capital is less than 38 percent, the 
project is worth undertaking. 5  The normal, domestic concerns apply to this project evalu-
ation; that is, the estimate is only as good as the forecasts of costs and sales. In addition, this 
foreign project faces potentially important considerations such as exchange risk, currency 
inconvertibility and other country risks, and preferential local borrowing opportunities. 
 Chapter 15  provides more detailed discussion of this problem of country risk evaluation 
and management. 
 Exchange risk  will affect the US dollar value of the profits earned, potentially raising or 
lowering them substantially. For example, if the local-currency value rises by 10 percent in 
relation to the dollar, net income after tax will rise (in dollar terms) by 10 percent, other 
things equal. However, if imported materials come from the United States, that cost (in 
local currency) will fall. Similarly, if the loan is made in dollars, interest cost (in local-
currency terms) will fall. Sales, if any are exported from Shapironia, may decrease due to 
the exchange rate change. 6  In sum, a rise in the value of the local currency relative to the 
US dollar will tend to cause an increase in dollar profits from the affiliate, and such profits 
will tend to fall if the local currency devalues relative to the dollar. 
 Country risk  (defined in  Chapter 15 ) is another concern in the attempt to evaluate 
this project properly. If the host government decides to restrict profit remittances, then, 
no matter how profitable the project, the MNE will not be able to utilize its earnings 
 elsewhere in the firm or to distribute them to shareholders. This problem is known as 
 currency inconvertibility  , regardless of whether the cause is a political decision or sim-
ply an economic reality. If discontent with the Shapironia government leads to strikes or 
 violent confrontation between the government and opposition groups, the plant may be 
 Capital project evaluation follows many of the same principles in an international ﬁ rm as 
in a domestic ﬁ rm, though additional variables and risks must be considered. Speciﬁ cally, 
foreign projects must be evaluated for exchange risk, country risk, different ﬁ nancing costs, 
and any problems associated with the transfer of products, services, or funds due to gov-
ernment controls in any of the relevant countries. To see how these factors appear in the 
analysis, consider the following example of a food processing plant to be constructed by a 
US-based company in Shapironia (a ﬁ ctitious country). 
 The company has developed the following pro forma income statement for the pro-

damaged or its production curtailed. Not all country risk is negative; if the government 
chooses to reduce corporate taxes to stimulate greater investment, the project may gener-
ate greater profitability than that shown above. In sum, country risks need to be considered 
when the full set of the project’s financial implications is being judged.  
 Borrowing  costs may differ in Shapironia and the United States. Thus, if the firm uses 
its   weighted-average cost of capital   in capital budgeting decisions, this project should 
be adjusted to account for any locally subsidized borrowing opportunity that exists. Many 
countries (and states or provinces within countries) offer low-interest loans to corporate 
investors to attract production facilities and jobs. If this is true in Shapironia and if the 
firm chooses to borrow some funds locally, the subsidized capital cost should be reflected 
in the capital budget. The project as shown uses an intracompany loan whose interest may 
be charged at the parent’s actual cost of funds or marked up (or down) to achieve greater 
(or lesser) transfer of funds to the parent.  
 Finally, recall that the capital budget measures the project’s  incremental impact  on the 
whole firm. Thus, if there are export sales from the parent to this new affiliate, those new 
sales must be counted in the evaluation. If the project replaces sales that were formerly 
exported to Shapironia, those lost sales must be counted. Any other intracompany impacts 
should also be measured in the project evaluation. This means the project should be judged 
in comparison to other alternatives available to the firm serving the Shapironia market. If 
exports from the United States offer a greater incremental profitability than the proposed 
plant, exports should be chosen. In summary, the incremental gains to the firm from the 
proposed project should be compared to the potential gains from other international busi-
ness alternatives that may be available. 
 In contrast to domestic projects, one additional key question must be answered: who 
should conduct the analysis, the parent or the foreign subsidiary? Typically, the initial 
analysis is done at the subsidiary or branch level and then passed up to the head office for 
modification and/or approval. For example, two subsidiaries may both want to build a new 
tire plant and sell to the same market. Without coordination, they would compete against 
each other and the expected profits would not materialize. So the parent corporation will 
make a decision that benefits the entire organization. In this latter role the parent may 
have to turn down a positive NPV project from one subsidiary in favor of a higher NPV 
project from another subsidiary. The same process applies in reverse to plant closures: the 
shutdown will be at the plant with the largest negative NPV. Similarly, factories or holdings 
that do not generate sufficient profit may be sold. 
 Use of NPV 
 The parent company will review expenditure proposals because it has the necessary overall 
information to make these decisions. Moreover, such expenditure decisions will often be 
different from those of the subsidiary because the latter may use faulty valuation techniques 
or fail to address adequately the impact of political risk. In explaining why these differences 
occur, we must ﬁ rst review the basic NPV criterion. This criterion separates the ﬁ nancing 
and operating parts of the problem by discounting operating cash ﬂ ows by a weighted-
average cost of capital that embodies the ﬁ nancing decision. The NPV equation is: 
 
 
(16.1) 
 where: 
 
 
(16.2) 
 Weighted-average cost 
of capital (WACC) 
  The firm’s cost of obtaining 
funds from the various

source of funds is weighted 
(multiplied) by the 
percentage of total capital 
it provides. Thus, the WACC 
is W 1  (cost of using retained 
earnings)  W 2  (cost of 
bank borrowing)  W 3 (cost 
of other source of funds), 
where each cost is stated 
as an annual percentage 
rate and each W is the 
percentage of total capital 
from that source

 The deﬁ nitions of the terms are:

 C t  cash inflows in year  t 
 T  terminal date or end of project 
 K A  weighted-average cost of capital 
 k e  cost of equity capital 
 k d  cost of debt financing 
 t x  tax rate 
 D / V ,  S / V  debt and equity ratios, respectively 
 NPV  incremental net present value for the project. 
 In examining what determines the NPV, we must realize that disagreement between par-
ent and subsidiary can arise because of the discount rate  K A , investment cost, and annual 
cash flows. Political risk can also affect all values. For example, the risk of foreign currency 
controls can cause some of the future cash flows to be largely ignored by the  parent. From 
the parent’s perspective, if funds can no longer be remitted, their value is substantially 
reduced since they are not available for dividend payments or for reinvestment elsewhere. 
Conversely, once foreign exchange controls are in place, the parent will often treat blocked 
funds as being less valuable. From the parent’s perspective, the cost of future investments 
in the country, financed by these blocked funds, is reduced. In both cases the subsidiary is 
not directly concerned with the problem of foreign exchange controls, and it will discount 
all cash flows that are incremental from its own perspective. 
 Similarly, country risk may cause the parent to increase the discount rate or required 
return to reflect that risk. However, if the subsidiary does not agree with that perception, it 
will not increase the discount rate, so its calculation of the present value of the cash inflows 
and NPV will be higher. Moreover, if foreign exchange controls are enforced, the local 
capital markets can be isolated from the international capital market. From the subsidiary’s 
perspective, the result may be lower local real interest rates, which make local investment 
opportunities seem attractive. However, the parent, looking at global opportunities, may 
decide that it will make more sense to draw capital out of the country for reinvestment 
elsewhere. 
 Another reason that parent and local NPVs may differ is faulty application of the NPV 
framework. The most common errors are in incorrectly choosing  t x  and  K A . The tax rate  t x 
is relevant in two places, the incremental tax that results from the incremental profits and 
the incremental tax shield that results from debt financing. Here, the errors usually come 
from a failure to determine the incremental tax rate. From the subsidiary’s perspective the 
tax rate is the extra tax that it pays locally. However, the parent must also consider any 
incremental tax that it will pay once dividends are remitted. 
 In determining the discount rate  K A , several problems emerge. First, it is common that 
discount rates differ by several percentage points. The reason is obvious: inflation differs 
across different countries, and thus the inflationary premium built into the discount rate 
will differ. What the firm can never do is to use a discount rate from one country to evalu-
ate cash flows denominated in another currency. The correct procedure is to calculate the 
real discount rate and then to “gross it up” for the inflationary expectations of the relevant 
country. 
 Additionally, debt ratios differ across subsidiaries, and the weights in Equation 14.2 may 
alter the cost of capital. This will inevitably occur if the multinational maximizes the use of 
debt financing in a country with subsidized borrowing rates. However, the debt ratio of that 
country is then not appropriate for determining the cost of capital since the excess debt can 

521
CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
be carried only because that subsidiary is part of a multinational. Similarly, it is a mistake 
to use the local real cost of debt to determine the cost of capital. In both these examples, if 
the MNE uses local debt norms and local debt costs, it is negating the advantage of being a 
multinational. That advantage is the ability to raise debt internally where it is the cheapest. 
As a result, in a country with a high debt cost the firm may have very little debt, whereas in 
a country with subsidized interest costs it may have a large amount of debt. In both cases 
there is no effect on the overall cost of funds to the multinational. Hence local debt norms 
and interest costs will be ignored unless local regulations restrict the use of debt funds to 
projects within that country. In this instance, if the firm accepts a local project, it can also 
raise more subsidized foreign debt. If the money cannot be removed from the country by 
transfer pricing or whatever, then its cost is relevant in Equation 16.2.  
 Institutional features 
 Thus far the focus has been on the technical question of how to evaluate capital expendi-
tures. However, a very important institutional factor that warrants attention is the impact 
of government policies such as subsidies and controls. 
 Government intervention can affect the profitability of a project or its financing. For 
example, in considering foreign investments, countries such as Australia and Canada 
have  foreign investment review agencies  , which review these investments to ensure 
that they benefit the local economy. As a result, foreign investment is often contingent 
on factors such as local employment quotas, local sourcing of components, the transfer 
of technology, and a degree of local ownership. This intervention can obviously compli-
cate capital expenditure analysis. Frequently the result is to forecast specific, quantitative 
outcomes. For example, if technology is locally licensed, what is the possible impact of its 
being leaked to different countries? If the MNE has to train local middle management and 
to sell shares locally, how does this affect the probability of forcible divestiture at some 
future date? In many cases the result of local content regulations is to expropriate all the 
advantages possessed by the multinational. One of the particular problems here is local 
ownership requirements. The parent’s viewpoint is dominant on the assumption that the 
objective of the firm is to maximize its market value, which is owned by shareholders in 
the home country. However, once joint ventures and significant minority shareholdings 
are traded locally, this solution breaks down. The problem now becomes whose market 
value should be maximized. The result is that while minority ownership reduces the 
political risk of expropriation, it restricts the multinational’s freedom of action. It is, there-
fore, not surprising that, where political risk is lowered, minority shareholders get bought 
out. For example, Ford acquired its British minority shareholdings in 1961, and Shell 
bought out its minority US shareholdings in 1984.  
 However, government regulation is not all bad. Outside North America the intervention-
ist approach of most governments creates unique opportunities for the MNE. For example, 
most countries provide concessionary financing that is contingent on the use of certain 
local resources. The British Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has some of 
the lowest-cost money for export financing as long as the borrower uses British equipment. 
By structuring an investment to use British equipment, a multinational might be able to 
borrow $10 million at 3 percent interest instead of at a market rate of, say, 9 percent. In 
effect, this subsidized loan represents a gift by the British taxpayers. This value has to be 
factored into the analysis. The inclusion of subsidies also occurs in domestic capital expen-
diture analysis, for example, with the proliferation of small-business financing programs. 
However, in an international project, rather than being unusual, it is rare not to determine 
the value or cost of a particular government program. Recently government regulation of 
MNEs has been falling, leading to more cross-listings on the world stock exchange.

PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 The home ofﬁ ce of an MNE should have available to it funding from the domestic money 
and capital markets, as well as from international money and capital markets. The fund-
ing sources available to a  foreign afﬁ liate  of an MNE include debt and equity from the 
parent and local ﬁ nancing in the host country.  Table   16.5    presents a view of these sources 
that expands on the view presented in  Figure  16.1 and on the discussion in  Chapter 7 . 
The sources of credit to the MNE are divided between short- and long-term loans and 
between direct and intermediated provision of funds through a bank or some other ﬁ nan-
cial institution. 
 Notice that in addition to the funding that was discussed earlier in the intrafirm context, 
numerous sources of external funding are available to the MNE. These sources include 
funding from domestic money and capital markets in each country where the firm oper-
ates, as well as funding from the euromarkets in money centers such as London, New York, 
and Tokyo. A large firm from Norway, for example, could seek financing in the US mar-
ket through international bank loans, through bond issue, or even through issuing stock 
shares or American Depositary Receipts. 7 
 Financial structure 
 Financial structure in an MNE is complicated by the fact that the “normal”   debt–equity 
ratio   differs from industry to industry and from country to country. For example, the aver-
age debt–equity ratio in large Japanese companies is about 2.75 to 1. In the United States, 
this ratio is generally far less than 1, averaging about 0.6 for non-ﬁ nancial industries as a 
whole. As a rule, the total ﬁ nancial structure of an MNE follows the standards of the home-
country ﬁ nancial market, since shares are usually traded there. On the other hand, a US 
company’s afﬁ liate in Japan may be able to operate successfully with far higher leverage 
than that of the parent, given local conditions in Japan. Thus, the ﬁ nancial structures of 
foreign afﬁ liates may differ from that of the overall ﬁ rm or that of the parent in particular. 
The only limitation is that the ﬁ nancial structure of the afﬁ liate must not cause the ﬁ nan-
cial structure of the entire ﬁ rm to deviate from acceptable standards in the home country.

CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
 The entire MNE may choose to meet its external financing needs by borrowing through 
an affiliate in a low-interest country if such funding is available and if exchange rate protec-
tion still leaves financing costs lower than those in other currencies. As already noted, since 
the MNE is evaluated by investors in the home country, its overall debt–equity structure 
must satisfy the financial community in that country. However, if the firm sells shares of 
an affiliate in the host country’s financial market, the debt–equity position of the affiliate 
is an important issue. 
 For a wholly owned foreign subsidiary that does not sell shares in the host country, the 
debt–equity ratio should be determined by overall corporate needs. If funding is available 
at low cost (adjusted for expected exchange rate changes), local borrowing is appropriate. 
If a substantial amount of assets is exposed locally, local borrowing provides a hedge to 
both exchange and country risks. If the local currency is expected to devalue substantially, 
then, even if local interest rates are high, it may make sense to borrow locally, assuming 
the expected postdevaluation interest costs would be lower than the home-country costs. 
 Local equity financing may be forced on the firm if the host government demands 
partial local ownership of foreign enterprises. This situation exists today in many less 
developed countries and in most of the formerly communist countries. In this case, the 
affiliate’s debt–equity ratio may be skewed toward equity, especially if the parent seeks to 
avoid sending funds into that country. That is, financing for the affiliate would come from 
the local partner’s equity investment plus retained earnings, and other funding would be 
sought only after these sources were used up. 
 In countries with restrictions on funds transfers, such as profit and royalty remittances, 
equity financing would again be sensible—using those funds that cannot be taken out of 
the country. That is, if funds are blocked from transfer abroad, the MNE must reinvest 
them locally; investing the funds in the existing operation (that is, profit reinvestment) 
may offer a greater benefit than placing them in local financial instruments such as bank 
deposits or government securities. This strategy is widely used by multinationals, though 
most would prefer the freedom to take their funds out of the host country. 
 Finally, notice that  if  the MNE is able to lower its total borrowing costs by utilizing 
foreign sources of funds, it has gained an advantage relative to domestic firms that limit 
themselves to domestic financial markets in any country. If the MNE has a lower weighted-
average cost of capital for any given capital budget, it will undertake more projects than the 
purely domestic firm (or will be more profitable in the same projects).

524
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 Control   is the fundamental function of management that involves developing proﬁ t plans 
for the ﬁ rm and its divisions and then deciding what to do when actual operating results 
differ from those planned. For a foreign investment project, the ﬁ nancial control process 
generally begins with putting together a set of pro forma ﬁ nancial statements (income state-
ment, balance sheet, cash ﬂ ow report). Then detailed budgets are developed for individual 
divisions, allocating the full capital budget to the speciﬁ c purposes for which it will be used. 
During the time period after the creation of these plans, the ﬁ rm’s management observes 
the results and notes any deviations from the budget. Usually, of course, actual results dif-
fer from budgeted ones. Finally, the ﬁ rm develops and implements a management plan for 
dealing with the deviations. The process is cyclical—as each planning period ends, another 
begins—and new budgets and managerial contingencies may be developed.  
 In the multinational firm, the potential for substantial home-office control over affili-
ates exists because major capital budgeting usually requires more resources than those 
available in an affiliate, and home-office assistance is needed to carry out capital projects. 
In addition, financial reporting to the parent company provides an informational basis 
for controls, which may or may not be exercised, depending on the extent of the firm’s 
decentralization. Finally, because the people assigned to manage foreign affiliates are usu-
ally well known to the home-office managers, an informal, personal contact ties affiliates 
to the home office. All of this means that the home office has the potential to impose heavy 
controls on the activities of foreign affiliates. 
 The process described so far is substantially equivalent to the one used to evaluate and 
control domestic divisions in a firm. But foreign affiliates face a wide range of additional 
factors that may affect their performance, and these factors should be considered when 
setting the goals and judging the performance of affiliates. How should the managers of 
foreign affiliates be evaluated for their financial performance? If they are evaluated in local-
currency terms, the home office must worry about hedging foreign currency exposures 
and about remitting or reinvesting profits. If they are evaluated in home-currency terms, 
affiliate managers must deal with exchange risk and remittance policy. If they are limited 
in their financial dealings due to centralized cash and foreign exchange management pol-
icies but are evaluated in home-currency terms, it must be recognized that their options 
are limited. On another issue, if transfer prices are set to move funds to the home office, 
foreign profitability will look lower than it would if these prices were set to keep more 
funds in the affiliates. Correct evaluation of the performance of affiliate managers must 
take into account the constraints imposed on the affiliates. 
 Most managers and outside analysts agree that foreign affiliates must be evaluated in 
home-currency terms, since home-currency investors judge the firm as a whole. Therefore, 
the firm must create an evaluation scheme that produces home-currency performance 
measures, adjusted to account for the limitations placed on the affiliate by the home office.

 There are a number of ways that MNEs apply the international ﬁ nancial concepts that have 
been discussed in this chapter. One way is by employing a geocentric approach that helps to 
coordinate subsidiary operations and ensures that there is a uniform, harmonious strategy. 
This approach is particularly evident in the way that some multinationals are now closing 
 STRATEGIC INTERNATIONAL FINANCE 

525
CHAPTER 16  INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
local operations in favor of overseas production and are using joint ventures and other 
partnership arrangements to reduce their financial risk.8 Another approach is the manner 
in which financial management analysis is used in choosing sites for overseas operations. 
This is particularly true for foreign firms with strong currencies.
Establishing overseas operations
Because the United States is a major market for many international firms, foreign MNEs 
have been particularly concerned about the value of the US dollar. For example, when Ford 
Motor acquired Volvo’s automotive business, the Swedish firm insisted on receiving the 
purchase price in kronor. In 2009, when GM and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy and were 
bailed out by US taxpayers, Ford had to sell its luxury division, which included Jaguar, Land 
Rover and Volvo cars.9 This concern has also resulted in foreign firms setting up operations 
in the United States in order to offset the competitive impact associated with having a cur-
rency that is very strong vis-à-vis the US dollar. For example, BMW built an auto produc-
tion facility in South Carolina because it found it was 20 percent less costly to produce cars 
in South Carolina than to bring them in from Germany.10 Other companies have made 
acquisitions in the US market in order to protect their overall profitability. For example, 
BASF has acquired a Mobil plastic unit for $330 million; Benckiser purchased Coty, the fra-
grance maker, from Pfizer for $440 million; Siemens spent $1.2 billion to purchase ROLM, 
a manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, from IBM; and Daimler-Benz bought 
Chrysler for almost $40 billion. However, the buyout failed to produce the trans-Atlantic 
automotive powerhouse dealmakers had hoped for, and DaimlerChrysler announced on 
May 14, 2007 that it would sell Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management of New York, 
a private equity firm that specializes in restructuring troubled companies. On October 4, 
2007 a DaimlerChrysler Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting approved the renaming of 
the company. From October 5, 2007, the company has been titled Daimler AG. The US 
company adopted the name Chrysler LLC when the sale completed on August 3, 2007.11
At the same time US firms are continuing to move abroad, especially since many Asian 
currencies are at a low ebb and purchase prices have fallen. General Motors, for example, 
is now producing light trucks in China, has 16 ventures there related to producing auto 
components, and has opened a Buick plant in Shanghai. As of the end of 1998 the com-
pany was assembling close to 500,000 cars annually, most of which were small sedans or 
subcompacts.12 At the same time Atlantic Richfield and Phillips China have invested in 
ventures for drilling for methane gas, IBM is expanding its investment there Telluride 
International Energy is building a power plant, and Lucent Technologies has earmarked 
millions of dollars to expand its Internet backbone in the country.13 All of these moves to 
overseas operations give the multinational firm a reduced currency risk by diversifying the 
company’s cash flows into additional currencies.
European and US firms are not alone in their efforts to establish overseas operations. 
Pacific-based MNEs are also realizing the benefits of going local, and this group is not lim-
ited to auto makers. South Korean firms such as LG Group and Samsung are now using 
direct investment and joint ventures to help open markets in Europe and the United States. 
High labor costs, runaway interest rates, and low-cost competition are battering these 
firms at home, and local content laws have been holding down market acceptance abroad. 
In an effort to circumvent these problems, LG is using alliances to widen its market share, 
as seen by its collaboration with Gepi of Germany and Iberna of Italy to produce refrig-
erators for the European market. LG designs the units in its Ireland facility, Gepi supplies  
the components, and Iberna assembles the finished products. Samsung has purchased 
Werk für Fernsehelektronik, a former East German picture tube maker, and is spending  
$120 million to upgrade the plant, which will be capable of turning out 1.2 million

television sets annually. The company also bought an even larger German television maker, 
RFT, and moved its Portuguese and Spanish color television plants to England and its 
video cassette recorder plant from England to Spain in order to lower operational costs, to 
improve quality, and to increase employment. Again, the issue of concern here is that these 
firms are achieving a financial goal along with their strategic choices to go abroad; they are 
reducing exchange rate risk by diversifying their cash flows into different currencies.  
 Reducing financial risk 
 Although some of the above strategies are useful in reducing risk, there are other tactics that 
are also particularly useful, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures for new, high-
risk projects, partnering with established MNEs in order to gain international market share, 
and cutting operating costs through new plant design.  
 Alliances 
 In recent years an increasing number of MNEs have been joining together to share the costs 
of high-tech projects. This sharing involves not only research and development expenses, 
but also the costs of manufacturing and selling the ﬁ nished products. 
 One example is provided by Microsoft, which has entered into an alliance with Sony to 
link personal computers and consumer electronics devices, thus moving closer together on 
technology standards for digital television and other consumer products. The two firms 
have endorsed a technology that can connect video cassette recorders, camcorders, per-
sonal computers, and other devices. 14 Another example is GM and Isuzu, which are now 
extending their alliance in advanced vehicle technologies such as electric vehicles and fuel 
cells. 15  A third example is Kita Kyushu Coca-Cola Bottling and Sam Coca-Cola Bottling, 
two major bottlers in south-west Japan which have agreed to merge their operations and 
thus combine a somewhat fragmented distribution system into a smoother, seamless 
approach that should boost profitability. 16  A fourth example is Citigroup, which acquired 
a 15 percent equity in Taiwan’s Fubon Group. This alliance will serve as a springboard for 
future expansion in the Asian region. 17 
 Cost cutting 
 Other key ﬁ nancial strategies include cutting costs and investing in new plant and equip-
ment, resulting in higher productivity and lower expenses. Still another strategy is the re-
negotiation of labor contract agreements in high-cost areas of the world. While one strategy 
that is increasingly popular calls for moving production overseas to lower-cost locations, 
another response to this problem of high costs is to look for ways to reduce them in the 
existing operations. 
 Investment in new plant and equipment to achieve efficiencies is critical to the success 
of MNEs today just as it has been in the past. This is particularly true in Japan, where auto 
manufacturers are finding it increasingly difficult to hire new people. Worse yet, the turn-
over rate in some factories runs as high as 50 percent annually. In explaining the reason 
for this turnover, many workers refer to the three Ks:  kiken  (dangerous),  kitsui (difficult), 
and  kitanai  (dirty). Young people, in particular, prefer the slower-paced world of office 
work where people wear suits and ties, take leisurely lunch hours, and are not exhausted 
at the end of a long day. 
 In an effort to deal with this problem, Nissan Motors has built a new factory that prom-
ises to be far less stressful on the workers than anything yet. Company officials refer to it 
as a “dream factory” and claim that it is designed to reduce many of the pitfalls of past 

527
CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
manufacturing plants. The latter, for example, are characterized by the traditional conveyor 
belt from which cars are suspended. When the car reaches the workers, the employees 
scramble to install parts and to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. This typically 
involves squatting on the floor, stretching across the seat or the hood, ducking under the 
car, or reaching across the top of the vehicle to install or tighten something. If the workers 
are unable to keep up with the line, the conveyer belt must be stopped until they finish 
because all cars advance in lockstep. In contrast, Nissan’s new plant has done away with the 
conveyer belt. All cars are now placed on motor-driven dollies. These dollies can be raised 
or lowered so that the workers do not have to stretch or squat. Additionally, even if it takes 
longer than usual to complete a particular task, this creates no problem for the factory. 
The workers can simply scoot the dolly up to the next station as soon as they are finished. 
 Another difference between the Nissan plant and more conventional ones is that the 
work area is brightly lit with natural sunlight filtering in through skylights, compared 
to the poorly lit work environments in other plants. Additionally, the factory is air-
conditioned and the temperature is kept at 77°F (25°C), in contrast to other auto plants 
where there is no air-conditioning. Another welcome feature is the use of robots to 
perform the dirtiest and most difficult jobs, painting and welding. And to reduce worker 
exhaustion, robots carry out a large percentage of the actual assembly. A huge robot arm, 
for example, grabs seats from an overhead rack and swings them into the car with a flick 
of its mechanical wrist. Then a small robot arm bolts the seat to the floor. Nissan contends 
that this new plant will not only cut down on worker absenteeism and turnover, but also 
be 30 percent more efficient than those of the competition. 
 Other Japanese manufacturers are also heavily focused on cost cutting, but through 
the use of overseas production. For example, Honda and Toyota operations in the United 
States have been simultaneously reducing costs while increasing quality. The result is that 
car prices for many of their models have remained the same or dropped slightly in recent 
years, while the number of features has increased. This “more value for your money” con-
cept has been influential in helping both auto makers to increase their US market share and 
profitability. 18  Ford has been following a similar approach through a vigorous outsourcing 
program and by seeking to cut $1 billion from its costs, thus boosting its return on invest-
ment from the North American market and, hopefully, helping drive up stock price as 
well. 19 Simply put, cost cutting is a critical part of financial investment strategies.    
 1   International financial management encompasses a number of critical areas, including 
the management of global cash flows, foreign exchange risk management, capital expen-
diture analysis, and international financing. In carrying out these financial activities, 
MNEs can use three approaches or solutions: polycentric, ethnocentric, or geocentric.  
 2   There are three main areas of consideration in managing global cash flows. One is the 
movement of cash so that each subsidiary has the working capital needed to conduct 
operations. A second area is the use of funds positioning techniques that can help to 
reduce taxes and to deal with political and legal roadblocks that impede cash flows. A 
third is multilateral netting, which ensures that transactions between the subsidiaries 
are paid in a timely manner.  
 3   Foreign exchange risk management encompasses a variety of financial strategies that 
are designed to limit the multinational’s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. In par-
ticular, the MNE will want to reduce translation, transaction, and economic exposure. 
One of the most common ways of doing this is through hedging. Examples include the 
 KEY POINTS

purchase of forward exchange contracts and the balancing of foreign currency assets 
with foreign currency liabilities.  
 4   A third major strategic financial issue is capital expenditure analysis. This entails com-
putation and deliberation of such matters as the weighted cost of capital and the degree 
of political risk that is being assumed. Some of the methods of dealing with these issues 
were discussed with attention given to the fact that the final decision on capital expen-
ditures is often affected by subjective considerations as well as by objective evaluations.  
 5   At present MNEs are taking a number of important international financial steps. Some 
of the primary ones include designing global foreign exchange management programs, 
establishing international cash management centers, and creating coordinated inter-
national borrowing programs for affiliates.

 REVIEW AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 
 1  In determining parent–subsidiary relationships, how does a polycentric solution 
differ from an ethnocentric or geocentric solution? Compare and contrast all 
three. 
 2  What is meant by the term  working capital , and what are two of the most common 
ways that parent companies can provide this capital to their subsidiaries? What 
are two ways in which the parent can obtain funds from the subsidiaries?   
 3  How can an MNE shift profits through the use of transfer pricing? Provide an 
example. 
 4  Of what value is multilateral netting in helping MNEs to manage cash flows? Give 
an example. 
 5  If a foreign country is facing high inflation, what are three financial strategies that 
the local multinational unit might employ? Identify and describe each.   
 6  Why are MNEs interested in translation and consolidation of financial statements? 
Of what practical value is this activity to the company?   
 7  Under what conditions will an MNE face translation exposure? What financial 
strategy might the organization use to minimize this exposure?   
 8  When might an MNE face transaction exposure? What is a financial strategy that 
the firm could use to minimize this risk?   
 9  What is meant by the term  economic exposure ? What is a financial strategy that an 
MNE could use to minimize this risk?   

529
CHAPTER 16 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
 10  When would a multinational use a lead strategy to hedge a risk? When would a 
multinational use a lag strategy for this purpose? In each case, give an example. 
A lead strategy is a choice by an MNE to make intracompany payments (for 
example, from an affiliate to the home office) earlier than in an arm’s-length 
situation, to move funds out of the country of the affiliate more rapidly. A lag 
strategy is a choice by an MNE to make intracompany payments (for example, 
from an affiliate to the home office) later than in an arm’s-length situation, to 
hold funds longer in the affiliate country.   
 11  When might an MNE use a forward exchange contract (a contract with a bank 
to buy or sell foreign exchange at a future date, with the exchange rate and 
value fixed today)? When might the firm decide to forgo this strategy and leave
 a particular foreign currency transaction unhedged?   
 12  What role does net present value (NPV) play in the review of capital expenditure 
proposals? Give an example.   
 13  How can country risk affect the computation of NPV? Will the risk result in the 
MNE wanting a higher or a lower NPV? Explain.   
 14  Why do parent and local subsidiaries sometimes differ in their calculation of NPV 
for a particular project or expenditure? How can this difference be resolved?   
 15  What are some of the financing alternatives available to MNEs that are not 
available to domestic firms? Give an example.    
 REAL CASE 
 Skandia 
 Information technology has transformed the financial 
services and insurance business into a universal product. 
Instead of large numbers of white-collar clerical workers 
toiling in large local banking and insurance halls (like 
Bob Cratchit in Dickens’s  A Christmas Carol ) today such 
services can be provided on the Internet by smaller, more 
entrepreneurial groups and even from a home office. This 
is part of the new global knowledge-based economy. 
 Skandia is a Stockholm-based insurance and financial 
service company, founded some 150 years ago. In 2000, 
the Skandia Group had revenues of 21.7 million krona (US 
$2.30 million), six times the 1995 figure, and operations in 
20 countries. In 1900 Skandia became the first non-British 
insurance company to enter the US market, but it incurred 
losses in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and in 
World War I, to the extent that its international business 
was largely dormant and confined to reinsurance (business 
accepted for another company to diversify risk). 
 In 1986, the Assurance and Financial Services Division 
(AFS) of Skandia, headed by CEO Jan Carendi, made a big 
push in the United States. Over the next 12 years it grew 
by 45 percent per year. By 1998 the AFS Unit had sales 
of $3.5 billion with fewer than 2,000 employees. It sold a 
unit-linked variable life insurance product to independent 
insurance brokers. The product can be sold on the Internet. 
Basically, Skandia purchased mutual funds from other 
companies but included its own insurance package with 
them. Skandia was one of the first insurance companies 
to use such a self-directed unit trust (or mutual fund) that 
allowed customers to regard life insurance as being like a 
retirement savings plan. 
 To derive an ongoing competitive advantage in knowl-
edge management, Jan Carendi transformed the AFS 
Division of Skandia from a traditional bricks and mortar 
insurance company into a “clicks and mortar” virtual 
organization. He was one of the first to appoint a director 
of intellectual capital, retraining managers to be more 
flexible, innovative, and responsive to the consumers. 
While acting as a change agent, Carendi traveled some 
200 days a year to pull together a new “federal” model of 
internal management structure. One aspect of this was a 
group of independent fund managers; another was a new 
software package to manage the complex administrative 
structure. 
▼

530
PART FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGIES
 By the 1980s Skandia consisted of four divisions: 
 1  An actuarial function, designing insurance products 
based on risk assessments. 
 2  A sales and marketing group that sold directly to 
consumers. 
 3  An investment management group that invested 
premiums. 
 4  An administrative group that managed the customer, 
accounting, and regulatory paperwork. 
 Many of the traditional insurance functions were out-
sourced by Carendi. The fund management and also the 
sales and distribution functions were outsourced. Both of 
these required local knowledge of regulations for mutual 
funds and of personal networks for sales and distribution. 
Instead, AFS focused on internationally mobile knowledge 
capabilities, using high tech and the Internet. 
 An overdependence on the US market, from which 60 per-
cent of all Skandia’s revenues originate, led to a slower 
year in 2001. When the high-tech stocks plummeted in 
2001 after the dot.com bust, Skandia’s customers stopped 
buying. In July 2001, sales of variable annuities in the 
United States were halved to $2.5 billion, down from $5.7 in 
the previous year. Diversification into the more stable mar-
kets of Germany, Japan, and Spain over the subsequent 
years may help to recover the company’s profitability. 
Meanwhile, Skandia’s actuaries were busy creating new, 
more cautious products to be ready when US investors are 
ready to buy again. In 2003, Prudential Financial purchased 
American Skandia. In 2005 South African/British financial 
services group Old Mutual Plc launched a $6.5bn (£3.6bn) 
bid to acquire majority control of Skandia, which was met 
with resistance from some of Skandia’s shareholders and 
directors. On February 3, 2006, Old Mutual completed its 
acquisition of Skandia, which was subsequently delisted 
from the Stockholm and London stock exchanges. 
 The lesson is that reliance on Internet-based business 
on a global scale is just as risky as the old-fashioned, cen-
turies-earlier business cycles. In those times there were 
speculative stock market crashes, such as the South Seas 
Bubble (in 1720). In modern times, we have seen a similar 
dot.com/high-tech bubble burst in 2001, with profound 
repercussions, even in the stodgy world of insurance.

 Repsol’s acquisition of YPF 
 In 1993 the Argentine government sold controlling ownership 
in the national oil company, YPF (Yacimientos Petroliferos 
Fiscales), through an initial public offering on the Argentine 
stock market and through an American Depositary Receipt 
(ADR) issue on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as 
a Global Depositary Receipt (GDR) issue on the London 
Stock Exchange. This was the largest privatization in Latin 
America at that time, bringing the Argentine government 
about US $3 billion in the initial issue of about half of YPF’s 
total shares. 
 The initial privatization was carried out in July 1993, 
when YPF was sold in this initial public offering to lit-
erally thousands of investors in the open market. The 
government hired and installed a team of managers who 
took YPF through a huge and painful restructuring of its 
business and then the public sale of the company. Once 
YPF began to operate in the private sector as a listed 
company, the government continued to sell its remain-
ing shares over time. The privatization itself was not an 
example of foreign direct investment, since foreign inves-
tors only purchased small percentages of YPF shares 
or depositary receipts. However, in 1998, the Spanish oil 
company Repsol decided to purchase control of YPF, and 
did so by buying 14.99 percent of YPF shares from the gov-
ernment’s remaining 20 percent stake at that time. Repsol 
was able to obtain controlling interest in YPF in 1999 for a 
price of US $2.01 billion. 
 In mid-1999 Repsol raised its stake in YPF to 97.5 per-
cent, by making a tender offer for all the ADRs in New York 
and GDRs in London, along with shares in the Buenos Aires

Stock Exchange that it did not already own. The total cost of 
this tender was US $13.1 billion. These share acquisitions 
were financed by Repsol borrowing in Spain and in the 
euromarkets, in addition to internal funding. 
 The net result of these purchases made Repsol the 
owner of almost 98 percent of total outstanding YPF 
shares, with only small shareholdings outstanding to 
investors who failed to participate in the tender offer in 
1999. The total foreign direct investment replaced portfolio 
investment by those investors who had purchased ADRs or 
GDRs back in 1993, accounting for about 40 percent of total 
YPF shares. These investors probably did not reinvest their 
funds in Argentina once they sold their depositary receipts 
to Repsol, so no new investment went into Argentina at 
that time. Of course, the original portfolio investment in 
the ADRs or GDRs was an international investment, bring-
ing new funds into Argentina to pay for the depositary 
receipts. Those flows were recorded in 1993, and did not 
appear subsequently in the 1999 FDI process. That is, 
the investors in New York and London who had originally 
purchased shares of YPF in the ADR and GDR offerings 
there chose to sell those shares to Repsol, thus receiv-
ing Repsol’s cash, but not (necessarily) sending any funds 
to Argentina. All that happened was a change of foreign 
owners of those shares—but the new foreign owner was 
a direct investor rather than a portfolio, passive investor. 
This accounted for approximately US $10 billion of the total 
direct investment by Repsol, and thus for no new money 
coming into the country. The shares that were purchased 
from shareholders in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange 
(about US $3 billion of the total) did likely bring new funds 
into Argentina, assuming that the sellers kept the funds in 
the country. 
 The purchase of the government’s shareholdings in 
1998  did  imply direct financial transfers from abroad to 
Argentina, as Repsol paid the government for those shares 
and financed the purchase with funds from abroad. This 
US $2.01 billion thus  was  a transfer of funds to Argentina, 
different from the bulk of the investment. And as noted 
above, Repsol obtained the funds primarily through taking 
out bank loans in the eurocurrency market, denominating 
the loans in dollars, since YPF’s earnings were mostly in 
dollars.

1998–1999?

investment and foreign portfolio investment? Is this 
a relevant issue in the case?   
 3 What are American Depositary Receipts? Were they 
a useful tool for YPF in selling shares to the public?

with Hard Times,”  Fortune , January 25, 1993, pp. 78–81.  
    4  The option contract can also be used to hedge this 
transaction. American Express could buy 160 call options as 
listed in the example, for a total premium of US $125,000. 
For this price, American Express would receive the right to 
buy pounds at the strike price of US $1.5800 per pound, 
a worse price than the forward and futures contracts. 
(Actually, options for lower strike prices are available at 
much higher premiums.) The option does not look attractive 
unless American Express wants to speculate that the pound 
will go down in value even below the forward contract price. 
If this happens, by not exercising the options, American 
Express could simply buy pounds in the spot market in 
180 days and benefit from the lower price. The option 
is generally useful if the firm wants to speculate or if the 
original commercial contract may not be fulfilled so that the 
pounds may not be needed after all.  
    5  A full set of the measures used in capital budgeting appears 
in basic finance texts, such as Richard A. Brealey and Stewart 
C. Myers,  Principles of Corporate Finance , 9th ed. (Boston, 
MA: McGraw-Hill, 2010).  
    6  However, if the local-currency price goes up due to the 
currency revaluation and demand is price inelastic, the 
total revenue received may go up even if the quantity sold 
declines.  
    7  ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) are a derivative 
instrument based on shares of stock in a company. The 
issuing company typically sells a large quantity of shares 
in a block to an investment bank, which in turn holds 
those shares in its own treasury. The investment bank 
then issues ADRs whose value is based completely on 
the original shares, converted into US dollars, in the US 
market. See, for example,  http://daytrading.about.com/cs/

  Objectives of the chapter 
 The European Union (EU) is one of the world’s triad markets. It is 
the home of one-third of the world’s largest 500 firms. Also, many 
foreign MNEs from Asia and North America are now doing business 
in the EU or are targeting the area in their expansion plans. This 
chapter examines the EU environment and reviews some of the major 
strategy considerations that must be addressed by companies doing 
business in this economic bloc. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Describe  the Single European Market and the competitive status of 
the EU in relation to other triad members.  
 2  Discuss  how firms carry out an overall strategic analysis of the 
EU market in terms of competitive intelligence and evaluation of 
location. 
 3  Relate  some of the major strategy issues that must be considered 
when doing business in the EU, including exporting, strategic 
alliances and acquisitions, manufacturing considerations, 
marketing approaches, and management considerations.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 A good example of an organization that has become very 
strong in its home part of the triad is France Telecom, 
which has built up a major presence in the EU first through 
strategic alliances and through acquisitions of competitors. 
It can now use its strong EU home base as a staging ground 
to enter the North American and Asian markets, as was 
discussed in the earlier case on Vodafone (in  Chapter 8 ). 
 France Telecom SA is a leading telecommunication 
operator in Europe. It offers services covering fixed and 
mobile communications, data transmission, the Internet 
and multimedia, and other value-added services for indi-
viduals, businesses and other telecommunications and 
operators. It operates in three segments: the Personal 
Communication Services (PCS), the Home Communication 
Services (HCS) and the Enterprise Communication Service 
(ECS). The PCS segment consists of the mobile telecom-
munication services in Central and Eastern Europe, Africa, 
the Middle East, the Carribean and Asia; the HCS segment 
includes the fixed-line telecommunication activities (fixed-
line telephony, Internet services, operator services), as 
well as the distribution and support functions provided to 
the other segments of the France Telecom group, and the 
ECS segment provides communication solutions to large 
and small businesses worldwide. The company operates 
a number of subsidiaries, notably under the brand name 
Orange. It serves over 216 million customers in five conti-
nents, two-thirds of which come under its corporate brand 
‘Orange’. With €45.5 billion (US$60.262 billion) in revenues 
in 2010 and 163,813 employees (half outside France) 
the firm is one of Europe’s largest telecommunication 
companies. 
 Up to 1988, France Telecom was a department in the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. It began a 
process of privatization in 1998, under Lionel Jospin’s 
government, but the French government still owns part of 
the firm. This causes periodic clashes with EU competition 
commissioners, including an allegation that the firm was 
paid the equivalent of over $1 billion in unlawful subsidies 
in 2004. 
 France Telecom has come a long way since 1995, when 
75 percent of its revenues were from fixed-line operations 
and foreign sales accounted for only 2 percent of revenues. 
Today, France accounts for 49 percent of revenues and 
most of this comes from mobile and Internet services. 
Revenue from Spain and Poland accounts for 17 percent, 
the rest of the world 17 percent, international carriers and 
shared services 2 percent and enterprise 15 percent. 
 The rise of France Telecom in the European market and 
its expansion into wireless and Internet are the result of 
a combination of R&D expenditures, alliances, and strat-
egies. France Telecom R&D is one of the largest research 
centers in Europe, employing over 5,000 people and hold-
ing over 10,000 patents worldwide. R&D efforts strive to 
facilitate human interaction through telecommunications. 
France Telecom has also teamed up with other companies 
to complement its research efforts. It is working with 
Ericsson to provide integrated operator services for the 
home. An agreement with Motorola will seek to develop 
“seamless mobility” services for businesses. Meanwhile, 
it is collaborating with Nokia to provide mobile access to 
home multimedia content. These types of partnerships are 
also used to improve the process through which services 
are provided. For example, France Telecom and Alcatel are 
working on developing a new-generation network architec-
ture to unify fixed, wireless, and Internet media. 
 R&D has helped France Telecom secure a place in the 
European market. However, the fractured nature of the 
European market made strategic alliances a necessary 
element in France Telecom’s international strategy. The 
EU’s 27 members lack not only a common language but 
also a common regulatory system. Each country awards 
its own mobile licenses, forcing new entrants to make alli-
ances with license holders. In addition, the previous fixed-
line companies continue to own much of the local telecom 
infrastructure, increasing the benefits of partnering up.    
 In 1995, France Telecom joined Telekom and Sprint 
to form the Global One alliance, which was expected to 
serve as a springboard into the US market while protect-
ing France Telecom’s home market from competition by 
Telekom. In 1999, Sprint was purchased by MCI World,

CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
effectively voiding the alliance. In the same year, Deutsche 
Telekom also rescinded its obligations when it sought a 
merger with Telecom Italia. As a result, France Telecom 
redesigned its international strategy and began to compete 
directly with Deutsche Telekom in the German market 
by purchasing 17 percent of E-plus, the country’s third-
largest mobile phone operator. This marked a turning point 
for France Telecom’s international strategy. The company 
now favors acquisitions over alliances. 
 In January 2000, France Telecom purchased the Global 
One alliance from its partners, an event that marked the 
beginning of a purchasing spree. Later that year, it bought 
Orange (UK) from Vodafone. Orange had a presence in 
20 countries around the world, including 13 in Europe. 
France Telecom combined its own mobile business with 
that of Orange to create Europe’s second-largest mobile 
phone company. This acquisition was also a strategic 
move into the UK market. The firm’s biggest competitor, 
Deutsche Telekom, had already purchased One2One in 
the UK. With 12.2 million active customers, Orange was 
the largest mobile operator in the UK, catapulting France 
Telecom into the big leagues. 
 France Telecom also purchased Equant NV and 
Freeserve in 2000. Equant NV was combined with Global 
One under the name Equant. The new company is a corpo-
rate service provider in 220 countries and has 3,700 large 
business customers. Freeserve, the UK’s largest Internet 
service provider, was purchased by Wanadoo, France 
Telecom’s Internet subsidiary in 2004, and from 2006 has 
been known as Orange Home UK plc. 
 Like other telecommunications firms, France Telecom 
experienced a sharp decrease in share value in the early 
2000’s as a knock-on effect of the the dot.com bust; the 
cost of buying 3G mobile licenses in the UK, Germany, 
France, and Italy, among others; accumulated debt from 
the firm’s acquisitions and the lack of a strong market that 
would allow it to raise funds through the sale of equity. 
Despite this, and heavy competition from new entrants, 
France Telecom has been able to turn things around. Its 
share value has improved considerably and it remains 
a major European competitor. More recently its expan-
sion has increased with purchases of One GmbH, the 
third-largest mobile operator in Austria, and 51 percent 
of Telkom Kenya in 2007. In 2009 it partly merged the UK 
operations of Orange and T-Mobile through agreements 
with Deutsche Telecom. It also won the rights to be the 
exclusive distributor of the Apple iPhone in France. It is 
now strategically prepared to take advantage of future 
profits from 3G mobiles, the deregulation of telecom-
munications and increased competition in local markets, 
economies of scale on ISP, and the growing integration of 
the EU market.

 The EU currently consists of 27 countries. This includes the pre-2004 EU15, 10 other 
European countries that joined in 2004, and Bulgaria and Romania which joined in 2007. 
The EU15 are closely linked both economically and politically and this group is more 
loosely linked to the 12 new members. In terms of monetary policy, 12 of the pre-2004 
EU15 share a common currency, the euro, and constitute the eurozone. Today, the EU27

has a population of almost 500 million and generates an estimated 26 percent share of the 
world’s nominal GDP (US $17.533 trillion). Doing business in this bloc offers huge oppor-
tunities, and many MNEs are interested in tapping this giant potential (see  Table  17.1 ). 
  Emergence of a Single European Market 
 The origins of the EU go back to the formation of the European Economic Community 
(EEC) in the late 1950s, at which time there were six founding members: France, West 
Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. By the late 1990s, the EU had 
grown to include Austria, Finland, the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Greece, Spain, Sweden, and 
Portugal. In 2004, an additional 10 countries were added: Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Malta, and the Slovak Republic. Then 
in 2007 Bulgaria and Romania joined. (See the map of the EU in  Chapter 1 .) Over the last 
40 years rapid economic growth has led to a high degree of political and social integration.  
 The objectives of the EU are: 
 1  Elimination of customs duties among member states. 
 2   Elimination of obstacles to the free flow of import and/or export of goods and services 
among member states. 
 3   Establishment of common customs duties and unified industrial/commercial policies 
regarding countries outside the community. 
 4  Free movement of people and capital within the bloc. 
 5   Acceptance of common agricultural policies, transport policies, technical standards, 
health and safety regulations, and educational degrees.  
 6  Common measures for consumer protection.

 7   Common laws to maintain competition throughout the community and to fight 
monopolies or illegal cartels. 
 8  Regional funds to encourage the economic development of certain countries/regions.  
 9   Greater monetary and fiscal coordination among member states and certain common 
monetary/fiscal policies. 1 
 In December 1985, EU leaders adopted a White Paper that contained 279 proposals 
aimed at achieving a single unified European market by December 31, 1992. Less than 
two years later the   Single European Act (SEA) was passed. 2  A key part of the SEA was the 
EU   Council of Ministers  , one of the four major institutions of the EU. For each field of 
discussion, the EU Council of Ministers consists of one minister from each of the member 
states and is responsible for making major policy decisions for the union. The Council 
could now pass most proposals with a majority vote, in contrast to the unanimous vote 
needed previously. This opened the door for much faster progress toward both political 
and economic integration among member countries. Twelve of the EU15 countries have 
now adopted a single European currency, the euro, and have committed to a social charter, 
complete harmonization of social and economic policies, a common defense policy, and 
related measures that increase the power of the EU bureaucracy in Brussels. The Treaty of 
Lisbon, which came into force in 2009, was the last amendment to the constitutional basis 
of the EU. It provided for a greater role for the European Parliament and more ways for 
national governments and individual citizens to be involved in EU policy making. 
 Will the EU eventually bring about a   Single European Market (SEM)   in which the above 
stated goals are achieved? This will depend on the extent of progress in the area of free move-
ment of goods and the practice of government procurement. It will also depend on whether the 
new member countries, and any others that join in the future, can be harmoniously integrated.    
  Free movement of goods 
 There have been no customs duties between most EU members since March 1, 1986. Most 
technical, safety, and other standards and regulations for trade have now been standardized 
throughout the EU. However, free movement of goods has been hampered by fragmented 
local markets. This fragmentation has been created by exploiting language differences 
between countries and by setting artiﬁ cially high prices for goods. With the growth of dis-
count stores, mail-order houses, cross-border buying deals, and e-commerce these differ-
ences are gradually being eliminated. 
 The EU has also created a single currency, the euro,       3  which some believe is beginning 
to challenge the US dollar’s dominance of international trade and finance. In January 
2002, the euro officially replaced individual countries’ currencies in 12 member states. 
This had extended to 15 countries in the ‘eurozone’ by 2007, by which time it had the 
highest combined value of cash in circulation in the world, surpassing the US dollar. But 
some key countries, notably the UK, have not joined the single currency community and 
full financial integration across Europe has proved complex. 4  But the process of financial 
integration has helped generate new opportunities for both EU businesses as well as for 
foreign MNEs doing business there. 5 
  Practice of government procurement 
 EU government procurements account for 17 percent of the union’s GDP. In the past it has 
been common to ﬁ nd governments awarding contracts to national ﬁ rms. However, with 
the emergence of the SEM and the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), this is 
diminishing. The result will be greater efﬁ ciency, lower cost, and an economically stronger 
common market. On the other hand, it is important to realize that, in implementing this 
strategy, many companies are likely to ﬁ nd themselves losing business to competitors in

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
other EU countries that can provide higher quality and service and lower cost. This devel-
opment will also probably be somewhat slow in coming because of the possible negative 
impact of the economic growth of individual countries and the desire to favor national 
ﬁ rms when awarding government contracts. In 2004, a British government-commissioned 
study denounced the difﬁ culties faced by British ﬁ rms when competing for procurement 
contracts in other EU nations. Only 10 percent of all government contracts in the EU are 
awarded to foreign ﬁ rms, compared to 20 percent in the private sector. It is not that the rules 
of government procurement are faulty but that governments evade them to favor domestic 
ﬁ rms. For example, all contracts above a certain value must be publicly advertised but at 
least one government circumvented this rule by splitting the job into two smaller contracts. 
 Meanwhile, the EU continues to try to improve cross-border access to government 
procurement contracts. It has sought to standardize the procurement process to overcome 
language barriers. For example, the European Commission proposed a common vocabu-
lary to be used in all public procurement notices that would standardize the procurement 
process and increase competition. 
  Enlargement of the EU 
 The ascension of additional members into the EU since 2004 has changed the panorama of 
the union and raised questions about the feasibility of a truly integrated region, economically 
and politically. With the exception of the war on Iraq, the EU15 had been able to maintain 
a relatively common front in regards to foreign policy. The EU’s largest members disagreed 
on whether or not to support a US invasion of Iraq. France and Germany opposed the war 
while the UK strongly supported it.  6  Despite this, the union has been able to present a uni-
ﬁ ed stance on a number of other international matters, including aid to poorer nations 
and other wars. The inclusion of new, mostly Central European nations, into the union 
has added a new factor that further complicates reaching a consensus. Most of the new 
members are pro-American politically and aspire to their economic system, including low 
corporate taxation. This contrasts with the policies of Germany and France, two founding 
members that rely heavily on government involvement and often disagree with US foreign 
policy. The UK is more aligned with their views, but it stands as a less involved member in 
the EU when contrasted with France and Germany. Another topic of disagreement is Russia. 
Both Germany and France have good relations with Russia, whereas the new members see it 
with distrust. A common foreign policy is now less likely to emerge. 7  
 In addition, these new countries have not been fully integrated into the union. The pros-
pect of a flood of cheap labor into the EU15 nations created a negative reaction from EU15 
citizens. These new members, therefore, remain outside the Schengen zone of passport-free 
travel for at least a couple of years and cannot work in most EU15 countries for at least another 
six years. Indeed, only the UK, Ireland, and Sweden have opened their borders to workers 
from new member nations. The newer members have also been excluded from receiving the 
full amount of farm subsidies available to EU15 members. This is partly due to the expense of 
subsidizing farmers but also because the lower cost of producing in the new member countries 
would destabilize the EU15 member’s agricultural industry. In addition, the EU, the United 
States, and Japan are under increasing pressure from less developed countries to eliminate 
farm subsidies altogether. Offering full subsidies to the 12 new members would only exacerbate 
the situation if the EU decided to phase out agricultural subsidies. Nonetheless, new members 
are finding the EU15 a welcoming market for their agricultural products, which are still com-
petitive because of the lower costs of producing in their countries. Future enlargement is likely 
to follow the same or even more restrictive rights for new members. 
 Further enlargement also threatens to increase the differences among member countries, 
stymieing political and economic integration. In particular, the possibility that Turkey 
might join the union has created a lot of tension within the EU. Turkey’s mainly Islamic 

543
CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
population is relatively large, and the country has a relatively younger population that 
could have an impact on the political future of the aging EU. Many nationalist groups 
within the EU are against Turkey joining the union and, indeed, see any further enlarge-
ment as a dilution of their power within the union.       8  It is difficult to predict whether the 
EU27 has the potential to be as integrated politically and economically as did the EU15. For 
the time being, however, there is internal disagreement about further integration.

 Describe the stages by which France Telecom has built up a successful 
strategic base in the EU. What barriers to integration had to be overcome in 
the EU before France Telecom could buy up rival companies? 
 As a state-owned monopoly, France Telecom originally had a strong presence in its own 
market but relied heavily on fixed-line operations and had no significant international 
presence. Faced with deregulation, France Telecom sought to compete regionally but 
understood that to do so it had to have competitive products and access to international 
markets. Investment in R&D allowed the company to expand its product line while stra-
tegic alliances were sought to protect its market and expand into others. The Global One 
alliance with Telekom provided a period of competitive shelter from one of its major EU 
competitors. By the time this alliance was dissolved in 1999, France Telecom had the 
capacity to compete alone against major EU telecommunication companies and had begun 
to acquire companies to solidify its product line and enter new EU markets. 
 For France Telecom to be able to purchase rival firms, deregulation of telecommuni-
cations markets of individual countries in the EU had to occur. In addition, France Telecom 
acquisitions must overcome antitrust legislation in the EU.   
  The competitive status of the EU 
 The eventual emergence of an integrated EU will help greater Europe compete more 
effectively with the other triad members. However, several EU countries are currently at a 
competitive disadvantage in some areas. 
 Productivity 
 High wages, salaries, and fringe beneﬁ ts put some EU ﬁ rms at a disadvantage in competing 
with their US and Japanese counterparts. Labor laws in all EU countries make it extremely 
difﬁ cult to ﬁ re employees once they have been employed for a year. US companies have 
much greater freedom and ﬂ exibility in hiring and ﬁ ring their workers on short notice. This 
means that employees must remain productive to retain their jobs and that companies can 
adjust more readily to changes in demand for their product or service. Japanese ﬁ rms tend 
to treat their workers as a ﬁ xed cost and so ﬁ nd the practice of ﬁ ring to be unnecessary; 
employees are grateful to their employers and are willing to work hard to upgrade their 
skills and increase the company’s economic performance. 
 With some success, EUfirms are working to raise their productivity and match that 
of their major triad competitors. As shown in  Table   17.2   , in 2007, hourly compensation 
costs for production workers in manufacturing were higher in the main EU economies of 
France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK than in the United States. But costs were 
much lower in the newer EU countries and slightly lower in Japan. Over the last few years, 

544
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
cooperation between EU workers and companies to protect jobs has decreased hourly sal-
aries. (Also, see the case  International Business Strategy in Action: German management 
and unions in  Chapter 14 .) 
 Investment spending 
 Investment spending in EU countries has traditionally lagged behind. Part of this can be 
explained by rapid increases in wages and beneﬁ ts during the 1980s that were not offset 
by increases in productivity. As a result, EU ﬁ rms found themselves without the capital to 
invest and had to resort to borrowing. Demands for loans resulted in higher interest rates, 
which also put a strain on investors. More recently, EU economies have been doing much 
better, stabilizing government spending. Despite this, most European countries continue to 
perform below the US level in terms of overall productivity. (See  Figure  17.1 .) 
 Education 
 Another area in which EU countries have failed to maintain a competitive edge is education. 
While all three triad groups spend approximately 5 percent of GDP on education, the

CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
approaches are different. In Europe, most vocational training is provided at the high school 
level, whereas in the United States and Japan it comes later. Moreover, in the United States a 
higher percentage of the population attends college than in Europe or Japan. The European 
university curriculum is more theoretical than in either the United States or Japan. European 
educational institutions are also more rigid and less able to adapt to the changing needs of 
business, and there is less interaction between European educational institutions and indus-
try. Some believe that as a result, many European students receive training that is inappropri-
ate for the employment needs of European business and industry. This in part explains the 
high unemployment rates in the age group under 25 in many regions of Europe. The major 
challenge for European countries will be to modify their education systems and make them 
more ﬂ exible, more practical, and better able to adapt to the changing demands of industry.   
 Overall evaluation 
 In overall terms, the EU has traditionally lagged behind its triad competitors, although recent 
downturns in the US economy contrast with sustained growth in some EU countries, includ-
ing many in the south. As  Table  17.3 shows, in 1989 all the EU15 countries ranked in the top 
22 most competitive economies in the world. By 2008 there are 10 in this category and by 2011 
just 8 as newly emerging economies from Asia and elsewhere join the top ranks. The world 
is becoming a more competitive place, and some EU countries are ﬁ nding it hard to keep up. 
 What changes are likely to occur in the future? One is an increase in acquisitions and 
mergers among EU firms and between them and companies from outside the bloc. A 
second change is the emergence of new technologies that will be developed in EU labora-
tories. A third is additional free trade agreements and other economic arrangements among 
European countries that are designed to make the EU a stronger, more competitive market.       9

 To what extent is the triad strategy of France Telecom the same as that of 
Vodafone (in  Chapter 8 )? Are there any differences? 
 Both Vodafone and France Telecom have a stronger presence in the European market 
than in any other triad market. Acquisitions have been a major part of both their strategies 
to gain technology and market share in their own triad region and in other triad markets. 
One difference is Vodafone’s continued reliance on alliances, such as its joint venture with 
Bell Atlantic, whereas France Telecom no longer seeks alliances but equity in competi-
tors. Another difference is that the extent of Vodafone’s international expansion is much 
larger than France Telecom’s.   
 As we have seen, the EU is likely to be a very competitive market in the future. In preparing to 
do business in the EU, foreign MNEs must ﬁ rst conduct an overall strategic analysis, focusing 
on the competitive nature of the industry being targeted. Assuming that the enterprise intends 
to set up operations by FDI or alternative investments rather than merely export to the mar-
ket, the analysis must also evaluate location. This section examines both of these activities. 
 Using competitive intelligence 
 Competition in the EU has grown over the last few years. Some of the speciﬁ c strategies 
employed have included careful market segmentation, increased R&D, and the use of mergers, 
acquisitions, and alliances to help build market share and improve competitive strength. 
For example, GM centralized the management of its European operations to save costs and 
better control regional operations some time ago.       10  Apple monitors prices in Europe and as 
a result charged about $100 more for a basic iPad in London, England, than in the United 
States, when it launched the product in Europe in 2010.       11  Competitor intelligence has been 
an essential part of these developments. This approach employs two complementary paths: 
external information gathering and internal infrastructural analysis. 
 External information gathering 
 The information that is critical for competitor analysis is typically located in a variety of sources. 
For example, in the UK, Denmark, and Ireland, centralized government-controlled company 
registration ofﬁ ces provide ﬁ nancial information on registered ﬁ rms. Other useful sources of 
competitive information include the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), trade asso-
ciations, business information services, and regional and local publications. In France, a great 
deal of registration information is commonly found in local courthouses. This is also the case 
in Germany and Italy, where companies must register with the local civil courts in the region 
where they are headquartered. In these countries, chambers of commerce are also excellent 
sources of information because they work much more closely with business ﬁ rms than do their 
counterparts in the United States. Central databases created by the EU Commission can be 
used to keep abreast of changes in national legislation, thus keeping companies aware of new 
laws and regulations. An understanding of the legal, technical, and cultural barriers often used 
to keep foreign competition at bay can be particularly important in an environmental analysis. 
The case  International Business Strategy in Action: Ford and Volvo illustrates this point.  
 CONDUCTING A STRATEGIC ANALYSIS 

547
CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Ford and Volvo 
 Before it bought into Mazda and took over the four European 
auto manufacturers that made up its Premier Brands 
Group (PAG), Ford had already developed a relatively strong 
presence in Europe. In contrast to GM’s mode of inter-
nationalization through M&A, Ford had expanded organically 
through the development of local sales, distribution, and 
manufacturing activities around the world. In Europe, it 
began with a plant in Manchester, England, in 1911 before 
moving to the Dagenham site near London in 1932. At its 
peak, three-quarters of Ford’s overseas production was 
located in Europe, with plants in Germany, Spain, the UK, 
and Belgium. Even then, however, including Brazil, around 
50 percent of total production took place in the Americas, 
primarily in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Table 1 
shows the range of brands that came under the Ford group 
in 2002.  
 This distribution reflected the regional sales mix of the 
Ford core brand, listed in the table, with 62 percent of 
sales in North America, 29 percent in Europe, and a weak 
5 percent showing in the Asia–Pacific region. This represents

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
the period when Ford maximized its European investments. 
The Premier Automotive Group (PAG) was created through 
a series of alliances and takeovers driven partly by the 
considerable drop in Ford’s market share in Europe from 
1994 to 1999, from almost 12 percent to just over 9 percent. 
A broad range of restructurings were initiated by then CEO 
Jacques Nasser, who stepped in to refocus on the central 
Ford brand operations and marketing. In 1999, Ford bought 
Volvo for $6.45 billion, the largest of the PAG companies, 
adding to Jaguar (bought in 1989), Aston Martin, and Land 
Rover. Since then it has sold all three. The dismantling 
of the PAG began in 2006, with Aston Martin sold to a UK 
group of investors in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover sold to 
Tata Motors for $2.3 billion in 2008 and in 2010, Ford sold 
Volvo to the Chinese carmaker Geely for $1.8 billion. 
 At its peak, the overall Ford Group, combining the core 
brands group and the European-centered PAG, appeared to 
be one of the more global of the largest auto firms. It was, 
however, still heavily regional and primarily US oriented. 
The relative lack of integration among the group companies, 
particularly Volvo, further underlined its regional structure. 
 First produced in Gothenburg, Sweden, Volvos were in-
itially designed to survive the rough roads and winter cold of 
Sweden. This emphasis on durability was eventually trans-
formed into the concern for passenger safety upon which 
the company’s reputation was built. Before the takeover, 
Volvo had made 70 percent of its cars in Sweden but had 
90 percent of its sales abroad. The firm had developed as a 
high-quality niche manufacturer of safe vehicles, competing 
against rivals such as Saab, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes. It 
had its own unique culture and way of developing cars and 
conducting business. 
 Ford bought Volvo in 1999 for $6.45 billion and sold over 
ten years later for $1.8 billion. The need to clearly dif-
ferentiate and segment individual brands was one major 
factor underlying the structural separation and cultural 
distinctiveness of the group companies in Ford. Whilst 
senior management at its Detroit HQ knew this it is safe to 
say that they underestimated the challenging complexities 
of managing a diverse group of brands spread across a 
different continent.

 Internal infrastructural analysis 
 The second step MNEs take is to analyze how to manage their infrastructure. Prescott and 
Gibbons have described four types of infrastructures that can be used to compete effec-
tively: coordinated, market coordination, resource point sharing, and autonomous.       12 The 
choice of infrastructure is determined by the similarity of national markets among the 
MNE’s businesses and the extent of resource sharing across businesses. 
 The  coordinated infrastructure   is used when there is a high degree of similarity 
among national markets and business units share resources in an effort to help each other 
raise overall sales. Computer firms often use this approach. Firms that compete in simi-
lar national markets but do little resource sharing among their businesses use a  market 
coordination infrastructure  . This approach is employed by companies that set up each 
operation as a separate, independent business, and sometimes by small firms that are 
geographically dispersed. Firms that compete in dissimilar national markets but share 
resources such as R&D efforts and manufacturing information use a   resource-sharing 
infrastructure  . Auto manufacturers use this approach. An   autonomous infrastructure 
is used by MNEs that compete in dissimilar national markets and do not share resources. 
Highly diversified MNEs use this approach. 
 Evaluating locations 
 The European Union is the largest market in the world, but despite the overarching insti-
tutions of the EU and the principle of the ‘single market’, the ease of market access for foreign 
ﬁ rms varies by industry and country location. The most important location factors tend to 
be: (1) access to customers, (2) quality of labor, (3) expansion prospects, (4) level of wage

costs, (5) attractive environment, (6) access to suppliers, (7) non-ﬁ nancial regional assist-
ance, (8) absence of restrictions for expansion, (9) infrastructure, (10) level of rents, and 
(11) public transportation. 
 Another factor often mentioned is the ease with which a company that is not doing well 
can withdraw. This includes laying off workers, selling facilities, and other factors involved 
in exiting a market. 
 Gathering location data and understanding negotiating terms can take a considerable 
amount of time, but the results often justify the investment. A great deal of useful and accessible 
data for market-entry evaluation is now online. The World Bank’s Doing Business website 
provides an interactive analysis comparing countries around the world in terms of the rela-
tive ease and costs of opening, operating and closing businesses.  Table   17.4    shows how a 
selected set of European and other (USA and Japan) countries compare according to some 
key evaluation criteria.  
 Regional incentives 
 Investment incentives take a number of forms, including grants, low-interest loans, reduced 
land prices, and training support for personnel. For example, both Poland and Slovakia 
offered incentives to the South Korean auto maker Kia to lure investment for a new manu-
facturing plant. The Czech Republic attracted a large amount of automotive FDI in the 
mid-2000’s and began to supplement manufacturing investment with FDI in services and 
R&D. In 2008 one the country’s ﬁ rst biotechnology clusters began to develop near Prague 
with 20 foreign companies initiating investments. 13  CzechInvest, the country’s investment-
promotion agency, and other Government departments use tax incentives and cheap loans 
to attract such investments. These extend the existing advantages of cheap land and labour 
(relative to Western Europe) as well as access to the growing markets of East and Central 
Europe. 
 Typically, incentives are higher when (1) the region is economically depressed, (2) many 
jobs are being created, (3) the company is making a large investment, and/or (4) the invest-
ment is likely to attract other investors. Before agreeing to any contract, however, it is impor-
tant that the deal be “locked in” and that any repayment of subsidies be made clear up front.    
 We now focus on a number of strategic issues that need to be considered when doing 
business in the EU, including (1) an overall strategic analysis, (2) the feasibility of export-
ing, (3) the value of strategic acquisitions and alliances, (4) marketing considerations, 
(5) manufacturing approaches, and (6) management considerations. This section brieﬂ y 
examines each issue. 
  Overall strategic analysis for the EU 
 In formulating a strategy for doing business in the EU, we should look at both the pro-
cess of globalization through economic integration and the need for a ﬁ rm’s   national 
responsiveness . 14  This is done on the matrix in  Figure   17.2   . The horizontal axis repre-
sents political sovereignty and the need for a ﬁ rm to be nationally responsive. We call this 
the “national responsiveness” axis. As a political axis, it takes into account both consumer 
tastes and government regulations. The vertical axis, or “integration” axis, represents glo-
balization through economic integration. This includes the need to develop economies of 
scale, use a value-added strategy, and reap the beneﬁ ts of greater coordination and control 
of geographically dispersed activities.

CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
 Quadrants 1 and 4 in  Figure   17.2    present relatively simple strategy situations. Quadrant 1 
requires a strategy in which the MNE does not need to be concerned with national respon-
siveness. The company is in a market driven by high integration and its strategy must be 
on achieving price competitiveness. Firms operating in this quadrant are often centralized 
in structure and thus can use mergers and acquisitions to benefit from high economic inte-
gration. Companies selling microcomputers frequently operate in quadrant 1.  
 In quadrant 4, economic integration is less important than national responsiveness, so 
the MNE must focus on adapting products to satisfy the specific demands of each country. In 
this case, integration is minimized in favor of a decentralized strategy of national respon-
siveness designed to appeal to select niches and target groups. Companies selling food 
products and designer clothes use this approach. 
 In quadrant 2, there is low integration and low national responsiveness. The potential 
of obtaining economies of scale and benefits of national or regional responsiveness are 
both small. MNEs operating in this quadrant are vulnerable to triad competitors. There is 
no advantage in centralized quality control or economies of scale and no ability to adapt 
activities to individual countries. MNEs selling inexpensive toys that are undifferentiated 
fall into this quadrant. 
 MNEs in quadrant 3 use a strategy of high integration and high national responsive-
ness characterized by strong price competitiveness and select target positioning. This is the 
most challenging quadrant to implement; the firm’s organization structure is complex, but 
it is the one in which many successful triad-based adaptive multinationals operate. Auto 
companies fall into this quadrant. 
 A close look at events in the EU reveals that Brussels’ administrators designed a strategy 
to help European firms move into quadrant 1. The plan is designed to create a natural entry 
barrier to outside firms and help ensure the success of local competitors. A survey of the top 
management of Europe’s 300 largest corporations has confirmed this tendency toward 
integration. The survey found that European managers anticipate greater integration 
due to such developments as strategic partnerships, mergers, and takeovers as well as

increasing economies of scale. 15 As a result, the managers expect the development of more 
efficient modern industries. The survey also found that European managers were confident 
that economic integration was a viable strategy for them but would be detrimental to non-
European MNEs. Only 9 percent of the managers believed US firms would gain ground in 
Europe, whereas 42 percent said US firms would lose competitive strength. 
 Exporting firms operate in quadrant 4. As outsiders in the EU, US firms will find it 
increasingly difficult to export to Europe and compete on economies of scale in the face of 
integration by rival EU firms. Not only will costs be higher for exporters, but locally based 
competitors will have more access to competitive information. As a result, today many 
exporting firms will be switching from exporting to FDI in order to meet the new nature 
of competition in Europe.

 In what ways will integration and localization be important issues for 
conducting mergers in the EU? 
 Companies successfully operating in different EU countries will seek mergers to achieve 
some economies of scale in R&D, design, sourcing, and distribution, among others. 
Nevertheless, the benefits of economies of scale have to be weighed against the need to 
tailor-make products for customers in different markets. Integration will therefore occur 
only in some sectors of the merged company.   
 Exporting 
 Those ﬁ rms that continue to export to the EU will have to address a number of legal/
ﬁ nancial matters. The following sections examine some of the most important issues. 
(See  Table  17.5 .)  
  Customs duties and taxes 
 Goods manufactured outside the EU are subject to customs duties at the point of entry. 
These duties are determined by an EU-wide tariff system that establishes common rates 
regardless of entry point. Most duties are based on the value of the good ad valorem, which 
in turn depends on the stage of assembly or completion of the end product. 
 Product standards 
 Products exported to the EU must meet standards and technical regulations. Many of these 
are common throughout the bloc, but when they are not the product must meet the stand-
ards of the country to which it is exported. In many cases, products made in outside countries 
must be modiﬁ ed in order to gain EU entry. 16 
 Conducting export operations 
 In recent years, many US exporters of both goods and services have consolidated their 
operations with those of European companies, helping them to surmount EU barriers. For 
example, US accounting ﬁ rms typically operate through local partnerships. Other examples 
are management consulting ﬁ rms with international operations that help address the needs 
of local clients and law ﬁ rms with overseas ofﬁ ces. 

553
CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
 Those MNEs that do choose to export to the EU must carefully select their agents and 
distributors. Five steps are critical to this process: 
 1   Examine the legal and business considerations involved in appointing foreign intermed-
iaries and establish criteria that reflect the particular geographic market.  
 2   Assemble a list of potential candidates by using the various directories and consulting 
with other sources of information.  
 3  Qualify such candidates by applying certain criteria and conducting a preliminary interview.  
 4   Visit the proposed intermediary to obtain additional information about its resources 
and facilities, to get a proper feeling for the intermediary’s compatibility with the 
organization, and to check the objectives of the agent or distributor.  
 5   After selecting an agent or distributor, (a) negotiate an agreement that is fair and mutu-
ally beneficial, (b) comply in good faith with the terms of the agreement, (c) continue 
communication between the parties, and (d) make occasional adjustments in the relation-
ship in response to changing circumstances. 
 Many small and intermediate MNEs will continue to export to the EU because it is too 
expensive for them to use any other route. Large MNEs, on the other hand, are turning 
more and more to strategic acquisitions and alliances.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
  Strategic acquisitions and alliances 
 Two of the most popular ways of gaining a foothold in the EU are strategic acquisitions and 
alliances. (See the case  International Business Strategy in Action: Deutsche Bahn: more 
than a railway .) A  Harvard Business Review  study analyzed 49 strategic alliances and con-
cluded that the chances of success are improved if the parties keep ﬁ ve guidelines in mind: 
(1) acquisitions work better than alliances when developing core businesses; (2) alliances 
are effective when ﬁ rms want to gain entry into new geographic markets or businesses that 
are tangential to the core business; (3) alliances between strong and weak companies typi-
cally do not work well; (4) alliances that last are characterized by an ability to move beyond 
the initially established expectations and objectives; and (5) alliances are more likely to 
be successful when both sides hold an equal amount of ﬁ nancial ownership. In addition, 
more than three-quarters of the alliances studied ended with one of the parties acquiring 
full control. 17  
  Making strategic alliances work 
 It is more common to ﬁ nd MNEs using strategic alliances than using acquisitions. One deﬁ -
nition suggests that these are a cooperative arrangement between two or more companies 
in which: 
 ■   a common strategy is developed in unison and a win-win attitude is adopted by all parties;  
 ■   the relationship is reciprocal, with each partner prepared to share specific strengths with 
the other, thus lending power to the enterprise;  
 ■  a pooling of resources, investment and risks occurs for mutual gain. 
 Several important steps are involved in making these arrangements work. One is that 
each partner must complement the other. 18  If one company is strong in R&D and the 
other’s strengths are in manufacturing and marketing, the alliance may be ideal. On the 
other hand, if both are strong in R&D and weak in manufacturing and marketing, there is 
no synergy and the two may end up trying to steal secrets from each other and competing 
rather than cooperating. Second, the goals of the two groups must be carefully spelled out. 
Once the partners have agreed on the primary criteria such as new product development, 
increased market share, and return on investment, they can then decide how to commit 
their resources. These goals provide a basis for overall direction. 
 Building working relationships across the two firms is essential for resolving problems 
and issues that come up. Communication, networking, and interpersonal relationships are 
extremely useful in ensuring that the spirit of the alliance is kept alive. Mutual understand-
ing, trust and compromise are important to sustaining alliances over long periods of time, 
This needs to be underpinned by a reciprocal respect and understanding of the cultural 
differences between firms from different parts of the EU and elsewhere. (See  Chapter 5  
in this textbook on “International Culture” and the “Active Learning Case” on “Culture 
Clash at Pharmacia and Upjohn”).    
 Marketing considerations 
 As the EU develops toward a true economic union, internal barriers to entry and mobility 
barriers within the bloc should disappear. This will create both challenges and opportun-
ities. In particular, competition is likely to increase as it becomes easier for competitors to 
invade each other’s territories. There is also a complex trade-off between integration and 
expansion, particularly as the latter encompasses a wider range of economies, institutions, 
and cultures, which works against some forms of standardization and harmonization.       19 As 
a result, marketing strategies in the future will have to reﬂ ect concern for both pricing and 
positioning. 20

CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Deutsche Bahn: more than a railway 
 Deutsche Bahn is one of the world’s largest passenger, 
freight, and logistics companies. It has a huge passenger 
railway station in the center of Berlin and has its execu-
tive training center in a Potsdam train museum. Deutsche 
Bahn Aktiengesellschaft (DB) was founded in 1994, and by 
2001 its sales were US $14 billion. During the 2010 finan-
cial year, DB Group posted revenues of about €34.4 billion, 
and an EBIT of a good €1.9 billion after adjustments for 
special items. It was ranked 177 on the Global Fortune 
500 list. 
 With its head office in Berlin, DB is well known to the 
2.5 billion passengers who use its extensive Europe-wide 
train and bus network, served by about 290,000 employees, 
of which about 189,000 are located in Germany. DB also 
operates the subway (metro) system in Berlin and Hamburg, 
as well as many urban bus routes. Indeed, DB manages the 
densest and most complex rail network in the world and it 
is the European leader in rail freight and land transportation 
beating SNCF, Tenitalia, RCA, and DHL. The rail side of its 
operation accounts for over 50 percent of total turnover. 
 Despite attempts to harmonize the rail industry across 
the EU, there remain many obstacles to European expan-
sion, including the differences in fuels and safety regu-
lations and also language barriers. As a result, rather 
than expanding across its borders, though there have 
been some exceptional success stories on that front like 
the Paris–Frankfurt line, DB’s CEO Martmut Mehdorn has 
sought to expand within its country by attracting the poten-
tial consumer who does not yet take advantage of the train 
system. The strategy has been to think outside the box and 
look at how the train experience can become easier for 
passengers, businesses, and governments. For example, 
DB offers a car share program, a rent a car program, and 
even a bike rental program to its passengers. A state gov-
ernment, on the other hand, might turn to DB to organize 
its entire transportation system including rail, subway, 
rapid transit, and/or buses.  
 But DB is much more than a railway company. Outside 
of rail, which is a base for all its other operations, DB has 
expanded into air and sea transportation. It is this diversi-
fication, according to Mehdorn, that allowed the company 
to finally turn a profit in 2004, 11 years after the govern-
ment changed the ownership and management structure 
of the company. Overall, DB logistics, with its five business 
units, (Rail Freight, Intermodal, Land Transport, Air/Ocean 
Freight, and Contract Logistics/SCM), is ranked second in 
the world behind DHL. Including its freight part of its rail 
business, logistics accounts for 57 percent of the group’s 
revenues (most of the rest is from its passenger busi-
ness, which, together with air freight, is organized under 
the Schenker business name). In global air freight the DB 
Schenker division ranks just behind DHL and ahead of UPS. 
Schenker is number three in global ocean freight behind 
DHL and Kuhne & Nagel. 
 DB is a home-region, not a global, company even though 
it operates in over 130 countries. Most of its employees work 
in Europe where it has the great majority of its sales (the 
geographic sales of the group, by region, are not reported). 
Virtually all of its passenger business is in Europe, and 
most of its logistic business, and this was further extended 
by its acquisition of UK-based transport 
firm Arriva in 2010. The firm has, how-
ever, some investments in North America 
because its Schenker division acquired 
the US logistics firm BAX in 2006 for 
$1.1 billion. In addition to its business in 
the United States, DB is also involved in 
China where it participates in an inter-
national consortia building a new rail and 
road transport system. It has an 8 percent 
stake in the consortium which is led by a 
Chinese state-owned firm, CRCTC. With 
the expansion of the EU into Eastern 
Europe, DB is well positioned to further 
develop its markets in Europe.  
 In summary, since the German govern-
ment decided to distance itself from the

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Pricing 
 The European Commission has estimated that the price of goods and services throughout 
the EU will decline. Five speciﬁ c developments will make this work: (1) decreasing costs 
of doing business, now that internal barriers and restrictions have been removed; (2) the 
opening up of public procurement contracts to broader competition; (3) foreign invest-
ment that will increase production capacity; (4) more rigorous enforcement of competition 
policy; and (5) general intensiﬁ ed competition brought about by economic reforms. 
 Price will become an even more important marketing factor to the extent that EU 
customers develop similar tastes and are willing to accept globally standardized products. 
As this happens, MNEs will be able to sell the same product throughout the bloc without 
having to make modifications for local tastes. Unfortunately, whereas some goods can be 
marketed with this strategy, many will require careful positioning for select target groups.       21 
 Positioning 
 Some global products such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Marlboro cigarettes have universal 
appeal, but these are more the exception than the rule. For example, in the UK Renault cars 
are viewed as good economy cars, but in Spain they are perceived as luxury automobiles. 
Similarly, in the UK and the Netherlands, toothpaste is viewed as a hygiene product and 
sells much better than in Spain and Greece, where it is marketed as a cosmetic. 
 As a result, the marketing motto “Plan globally, act locally” will continue to be a useful 
dictum. A good example is provided by the EU cellular communications market, which 
offers tremendous opportunities but is also extremely competitive because there are so 
many submarkets throughout the community. As a result, the mobile communications 
market will likely end up being divided among a host of major competitors, each of which 
will position itself for a particular local or regional target group. 
management of Deutsche Bahn in 1994, the company has 
turned itself from a subsidized railway system to a self-
financing “mobility provider” that has now diversified into 
logistics, buses, sea freight, cars, and even bicycles. While, 
as of 2007, all of the company’s shares were still owned by 
the government, a process of privatisation has taken place 
since then. Both management and the government see the 
benefits of going public at a time when the company is well 
on the way to being much more than a railway.

In what ways will both pricing and positioning be important for companies like 
France Telecom doing business in the EU? 
 Companies like France Telecom must be prepared to take full advantage of the economies 
from EU integration. Costs must decrease in order to increase market share in the more 
competitive EU market. At the same time, companies must have access to the markets 
of the EU and market their products according to both customer expectation and profit 
maximization.   

557
CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
 Direct marketing 
 Another strategy likely to receive a great deal of attention is direct marketing. Most EU 
ﬁ rms tailor their products to narrow markets and direct mail is only now gaining attention. 
Unlike the United States, where businesses have been using telemarketing and other non-
traditional channels for well over a decade, this is a new approach for European consumers, 
and MNEs will have to surmount a number of challenges if they hope to direct-market 
their products, such as: (1) consumers speak different languages, so a universal message 
or strategy will not work throughout the bloc; (2) inclusion of direct-response telephone 
numbers in television spots is forbidden by the privacy laws of some member states such as 
Germany; and (3) information about potential clients is fragmented and not easily obtain-
able. In addition, a high credit card fraud rate has slowed down the growth potential of 
e-commerce. Nevertheless, direct marketing is likely to play a major role in MNE efforts to 
create a pan-European marketing strategy. 
 One study proposes that the overall convergence associated with European market inte-
gration will lead firms to emphasize three advertising strategies: creating a uniform brand 
image, appealing to cross-market segments, and increasing cost performance in advertising.       22 
 Manufacturing considerations 
 As individual country regulations are eliminated and EU members continue to standardize 
rules and regulations, it will be possible to produce uniform goods for the entire market. 
This will not come about immediately because of the time needed to change such things 
as electric systems so that toasters, television sets, and other home appliances can all be 
manufactured with the same type of plug. However, MNEs will eventually be able to pro-
duce many products with standard parts that work in all EU countries. At the same time, 
manufacturers will continue producing goods that appeal to local market tastes. For example, 
appliance makers now manufacture self-cleaning ovens for the French because of their 
tradition of high-temperature cooking. However, they typically leave out this option for the 
German market, where food is generally cooked at lower temperatures. Some major manu-
facturing considerations that warrant attention by those doing business in the EU include 
reducing costs, building factory networks, and entering into R&D alliances. 
 Reducing costs 
 There are now over 500 million consumers in Europe and their expenditure represents over 
half of the EU’s GDP. One manufacturing beneﬁ t of producing for this size of market is 
the ability to reduce cost per unit through the use of standardized components and large 
production runs. Economies of scale are possible, with the cost of components kept to a mini-
mum and large production runs allowing companies to spread ﬁ xed costs over more units. 
This means the cost per item can be sharply reduced. Moreover, economies of scale can be 
achieved even when production has to be tailored to local conditions. This is accomplished 
through the use of   delayed differentiation  , in which all products are manufactured in the 
same way for all countries or regions as late as possible in the assembly process. In these ﬁ nal 
stages, differentiation is then used to introduce particular features or special components.  
 MNEs also use outsourcing and just-in-time inventory systems to lower the cost of car-
rying parts and supplies. By tailoring deliveries and shipments to the production schedule, 
factories are able to minimize their investment in materials and work-in-process. This sys-
tem is also used by large retailers such as Marks & Spencer of the United Kingdom, which 
employs its electronic network system to keep track of inventory at each store in England, 
as well as on the continent, and to replenish its outlets as needed. 
 Another way in which costs are being controlled is by redesigning production processes, 
thus scrapping old, inefficient techniques in favor of more streamlined methods. This

includes careful study of competitive firms in order to identify and copy their successful 
approaches to cost control. It also entails the elimination of red tape and the use of well-
trained, highly motivated work teams.  
 Factory networks 
 MNEs in Europe have developedsophisticated networks of factories that both produce com-
ponents and ﬁ nished goods and provide distribution and after-sales services. For example, 
the Philips television factory in Bruges, Belgium, uses tubes that are supplied from a factory 
in Germany, transistors from France, plastics produced in Italy, and electronic components 
that come from another factory in Belgium. 
 These factory networks are also integrated with computer software packages that can 
operate in multiple European countries without the need for modification.  Figure   17.3    
provides an illustration. The software packages allow companies to make supply, produc-
tion, and distribution decisions while satisfying the requirements of the different legal 
entities in the countries where they operate. Some specific functions they help companies 
to perform include forecasting, logistics planning, inventory planning, production plan-
ning, and central updating of bills of materials. The software provides each factory man-
ager with the specific information needed and does so in the manager’s own language. As 
a result, MNEs are able to coordinate multiple activities and thereby develop an effective 
pan-European manufacturing system. 
 R&D alliances 
 Another emerging manufacturing strategy is participation in cooperative R&D programs. 
In the EU this is taking two complementary paths. First, many companies are teaming up 
to share R&D expenses. Siemens and Philips have used this approach to develop computer 
chips, and IBM has a number of agreements with European ﬁ rms for developing advanced 
computer technology.  
 Second, many firms are trying to get some of these costs funded by participating in 
European cooperative R&D programs. The EU provides European industry with funding for

CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
research in such areas as information technology, biotechnology, and energy. The objective 
of the program is to stimulate cross-border cooperation and make Europe more productive 
and competitive in the world market. One of the best-known programs is the   European 
Research Cooperation Agency   (Eureka, for short), which was launched in 1985 and empha-
sizes projects in the fields of energy, medicine, biotechnology, communications, information 
technology, transport, new materials, robotics, production automation, lasers, and the environ-
ment. 23  This program has helped develop a European standard for high-definition television 
(HDTV) and has funded semiconductor research. A central aim is to meet the European 
objective of raising investment in R&D. EU funding for large-scale projects and coordination 
across member states also drives economies of scale in R&D, to allow countries to compete 
in science and technology development with the USA, Japan and China. Firms that are inter-
ested in participating in these cooperative programs typically do so by carrying out six steps:  
 1  Find out if the company is eligible for EU-funded programs. 
 2   Carefully study the EU rules regarding rights of ownership and dissemination of results.  
 3  Carefully choose the best location for a European R&D center. 
 4   Determine those competitors and major customers that are already participating in the 
program. 
 5  Gather recommendations from the firm’s EU and local management. 
 6  Put together the company’s application for funding. 
 Management considerations 
 As more ﬁ rms enter the EU, there is growing concern over their ability to manage Europeans 
effectively. Many ﬁ rms enter the market with preconceived ideas about how to interact with 
their European partners or employees. Some, for example, believe that management styles 
that have been effective in their country will also work well in Europe. However, as the 
Japanese have discovered in the United States, effective management approaches must be 
tailor-made to meet the needs of the local situation. The primary focus must be on adjust-
ing to cultural differences. 
  Adjusting to cultural differences 
 There are a number of differences between US and European workers. For example, 
Europeans are more accustomed to participating in decision making. They have a long his-
tory of worker participation programs and of holding seats on the board of directors. 
 Another difference is employee motivation. Researchers have found that quality of work 
life is extremely important in Scandinavian countries, whereas opportunities for individual 
achievement are of particular importance in the UK. French workers are interested in indi-
vidual achievement but place strong emphasis on security. German workers place a high 
value on both advancement and earnings.       24 Clearly, no universal list of motivators can be 
applied throughout the EU. These facts illustrate the importance of MNEs having a global 
perspective as well as having managers who are focused on the country-specific needs of 
the area in which they are working.   
  Barriers to EU market access 
 Throughout this book, we have explored the need for access to triad markets. Although the 
EU has become the world’s largest market, some EU-based MNEs and governments have 
sought to restrict access to this area. The overall trend during the postwar period has been 
toward an increasingly liberalized trade environment, but international managers nonethe-
less must know how to deal with, or at least anticipate, the use of administrative barriers in 
foreign markets.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 The two most common trade law entry barriers are   countervailing duty (CVD) laws and 
 antidumping duty (AD)   laws. (These were discussed earlier in Chapters 6 and 10.) While the 
United States uses CVD as an entry barrier (it had 90 percent of the world’s CVD cases in the 
1980s), the EU uses AD. Both CVD and AD are import tariffs intended to protect domestic 
producers from harmful dumping and subsidization by foreign governments. However, it 
has been demonstrated in several studies that these laws have been “captured” and used by 
weak firms seeking shelter from strong competition by rival MNEs in the triad. 25      
  Table   17.6    shows both the high number of AD cases that were launched and the ten-
dency toward sectoral concentration in the use of AD by EU firms during the period from 
2002 to 2009. Many AD cases were brought in the chemical, electronics, iron and steel, and 
other “mature” sectors that have weak firm-specific advantages (FSAs).   
 The use of these trade law instruments to provide shelter is by no means unique to 
the EU, as the earlier discussion of AD and CVD in  Chapter 10  showed.       26  However, from 
 Table   17.6    it is clear that non-EU firms in the chemical, electronics, and iron and steel 
sectors should probably anticipate some resistance if they plan to begin exporting to the 
EU market with a view to competing with domestic producers. 
  Figure   17.4    shows the rationale for the use of AD and CVD laws by particular firms. As 
with all free market economies, the EU economy has, at any given point in time, a signifi-
cant number of firms in difficulty due to the pressure of global competition. These firms 
are barely able to compete with their more efficient global rivals and find themselves on the 
verge of exit from the industry. If the main reason for this is international competition, and 
domestic administrative instruments are in place that would allow such a firm to continue 
operating by limiting foreign competition, the company is likely to use these instruments. 
Such a situation is a rare instance when it is logical for a firm to spend time and money 
on an activity that is not productive from a competitiveness standpoint. By using AD or 
CVD laws, the uncompetitive firm is able to remain in operation not by improving its 
firm-specific advantages but by artificially raising the price at which foreign competitors 
must sell in the domestic market.  
 The abusive use of AD and CVD is a particular problem for non-triad members and for 
MNEs from other parts of the triad because the administration of these trade laws is dis-
cretionary and subject to political pressures. Moreover, there is now strong evidence that the 
administration of these trade laws is biased in favor of domestic plaintiffs and against foreign

firms. 27  The technical test of “material injury” due to the subsidies or dumped exports is 
routinely abused by the responsible administrative agencies in both the EU and the United 
States. 28  This is an extremely serious problem for global business and serves to reinforce 
the existence of the triad at the expense of a liberalized world trade and investment system.

 1   The overall objective of the EU is to create a market in which there are no economic 
barriers to trade between the member countries. When this is achieved, the EU will be 
the largest economic bloc in the world. However, there are two areas in particular in 
which additional progress must be made: free movement of goods and the practice of 
government procurement. In addition, many new entrants into the EU (and a few of 
the original members) have yet to be integrated in terms of adopting the euro and are 
not yet allowed free movement of labor and passport-free travel. They also threaten the 
possibility of a unified regional foreign policy.

 REVIEW AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 
 1  What are the ultimate objectives of the EU? Identify and describe them.   
 2  Will the EU bring about the single European Market? What type of changes will 
have to take place for this to happen? Identify and describe three of them.   
 3 What is the competitive status of the main EU economies in terms of labor 
productivity and investment spending? Based on your answer, what is your overall 
evaluation of this status?   
 4 How can firms doing business in the EU use competitive intelligence? Identify and 
describe two major steps that can be used in this process.   
 5 What types of regional incentives do countries offer MNEs willing to set up 
operations in their locales? Identify and describe two of them.   
 6 In addition to regional incentives, what other evaluation criteria should MNEs 
employ when deciding where in the EU to establish operations? Identify and 
describe three of them.   
 2   The current competitive status of the EU lags that of the United States and Japan in a 
number of areas, including productivity, investment spending, and education. Greater 
economic strides will be needed if the region is to compete effectively with its triad 
counterparts. 
 3   In preparing to do business in the EU, MNEs should focus on the competitive nature of 
the targeted industry and the evaluation of location. Competitive intelligence gathering 
involves external information gathering and internal infrastructural analysis. Location 
evaluation entails the consideration of such factors as regional incentives, operating 
costs, and distance from major markets.  
 4   Many aspects of strategy need to be considered when doing business in the EU, includ-
ing (a) an overall analysis of the environment, (b) the feasibility of exporting, (c) the 
value of strategic alliances and acquisitions, (d) marketing considerations, (e) manu-
facturing approaches, and (f) management considerations. Managers need to weigh the 
choices of economic integration and/or national responsiveness very carefully.  
 5   The EU has a large internal market. Firms located in the EU can use non-tariff barriers 
to entry to keep out rival firms, namely, trade remedy legislation such as countervailing 
duty (CVD) laws and antidumping (AD) laws. Recent research has found that the use 
of both CVD and AD is a “shelter” strategy designed to protect uncompetitive domestic 
firms. However, the more successful EU firms concentrate on the development of sus-
tainable firm-specific advantages rather than on the use of CVD and AD laws.

CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
 7 In formulating a strategy for doing business in the EU, there are two primary 
areas of initial consideration: national responsiveness and economic integration. 
What does this statement mean? Be sure to include a discussion of  Figure   17.2    in 
your answer.   
  8 What do companies that want to export to the EU need to know about doing 
business there? Discuss five facts or strategies that would be of value to them.   
 9 In gaining a foothold in the EU, when is it most effective to opt for an acquisition 
over an alliance? When is a strategic alliance a better choice? In each case, 
provide an example.   
 10 Why will marketing strategies in the EU have to reflect a concern for pricing? 
A concern for positioning? Give an example of when each would be the most 
important consideration.   
 11  What is the likely future of direct marketing in the EU? Defend your answer.   
 12 What are three major manufacturing considerations for companies doing 
business in the EU? Identify and describe each.   
 13  How important is it for EU managers to have a global perspective?   
 14  How can trade laws be used by EU firms to keep out global competitors?   
 15 What evidence is there that EU firms use antidumping laws?   
 16 The EU accepted 10 new members into the union in 2004 and another 2 in 2007. 
Are these members fully integrated? What problems might we envisage from new 
members in the future?   
 17 How are new entrants into the union likely to affect employment in the EU?    
 REAL CASE 
 Accor budget hotels 
 The largest manager of budget-priced hotels in the world 
is the French company Accor. In 2010 it owned over 4,200 
hotels in 90 countries under the brands Sofitel, Pullman, 
Novotel, Mercure, Suitehotel, All Seasons, Ibis, Etap Hotel, 
Formule 1, and Motel 6 and its related activities, Thalassa 
sea & spa and Lenotre, which provide an offer ranging 
from luxury to budget class. About half of these are in the 
budget class of hotels. In 2010, with a workforce of 143,939 
employees, Accor generated revenues of US$ 7.877 billion 
(€5.9 billion), of which 34 percent was generated in France, 
39 percent in Europe (excluding France), 10 percent in 
North America, 5 percent in Latin America, 11 percent in 
rest of world. Accor is a home region firm with focus on 
Europe where its total sales is 73 percent (France and 
rest of Europe together). The Accor Group has developed 
international capabilities in being a major service provider 
to the tourist, business travel, and food business sectors. It 
is developing an international brand name for the group’s 
activities in these areas and uses B2B and B2C Internet 
services extensively for the purposes of promotion and 
managing partnerships. There are 860,000 restaurant 
managers, supermarket suppliers, and other affiliated 
workers using its B2B services, along with another 300,000 
customers/small-business people using B2C. 
 The company began operations in 1967 and rapidly 
expanded its Novotel hotels across France. The acquisition 
of another hotel chain in 1974, Courtepailles, established 
Accor as a major player in the French market. During the 
next two years the company moved to develop a market 
presence in the two- and three-star hotel market segment, 
opening an Ibis two-star hotel in Bordeaux and acquiring 
the three-star Mercure hotel chain. 
 The first significant expansion outside France was the 
1973 opening of Novotel in Warsaw, Poland. In 1976, Accor 
opened its first hotel in Brazil and over the next year 
began to rapidly develop in Latin America. In 1979, Accor

entered the US market with hotels in Minneapolis and New 
York; in 1984 a large Novotel was erected in Broadway. To 
enter the affordable US hotel market, the Motel 6 chain 
was purchased in 1990. By acquiring Sofitel in 1980 the 
company entered the African market and strengthened its 
position in Europe. In 1986, Accor began development in 
Asia, including China and Thailand. In preparation for the 
2008 Olympic games, Accor entered a joint venture with the 
Beijing Tourism Group to manage 50 hotels. 
 Accor is also in the travel business. In France it owns 
Carlson Wagonlit Travel and Frantour. Acquiring international 
travel companies has allowed Accor to complement its 
international hotel expansion plans. The acquisition of 
Africatours in 1984 allowed Accor to control the stream of 
tourism in the region. In 1987, Africatours acquired Asia 
Tours and America Tours. In 2000, Accor purchased a 
38.5 percent stake in Go Voyages, an e-travel planner that 
targets the European traveler. Growing expertise in the 
hospitality business has also allowed the company to diver-
sify into other areas, including restaurants and casinos. 
The table below shows the global spread of Accor hotels 
by region and brand. 
 A report by Datamonitor ( www.datamonitor.com ) outlines 
the Accor Group’s main strengths and weakness in 2008. 
Strengths include: a wide range of product and service offer-
ings, an improving financial position, and a strong focus on 
customer service. Weaknesses include: underperforming 
assets, an overdependence on hotels (65 percent of revenues), 
and a geographic concentration in Europe (68 percent of 
revenues). The recovering European hotel industry, current 
expansion in China and India, and the recovering business 
travel market are all opportunities for the group. These are 
offset by the growing range of competitors, particularly in 
the low-cost travel and leisure segments.   
 1    Why did Accor concentrate on the French and European markets before expanding into other regions?   
 2    How are acquisitions an important part of Accor’s expansion strategy?   
 3 What are the advantages of increasingly relying on the Internet for B2B and B2C?

CHAPTER 17 EUROPEAN UNION
 REAL CASE 
 Carrefour 
 Saturated markets, growing economies in Asia and Eastern 
Europe, and improving transportation systems are all fac-
tors driving large retailers to expand abroad, with mixed 
success. Tesco has moved into China and the United 
States, Carrefour has pulled out of some East European 
countries in order to focus on expansion in China, and 
Wal-Mart is pushing for growth in a range of new markets. 
French retail giant Carrefour (“crossroads” in French) is 
the number one retailer in Europe and number two in the 
world, In 2009, Carrefour had 69 percent of its sales in 
Europe but it had almost 15,594 stores spread through-
out 29 countries on four continents with revenues of 
$121.452 billion (€85.360 billion). In 2010, Carrefour SA’s 
total revenue increased 5 percent to €91.51 billion.  
 Carrefour SA is a France-based company that is primarily 
engaged in retail distribution. It operates a network of 
hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discount stores, con-
venience stores and cash-and-carry outlets, and offers 
e-commerce services. The company’s hypermarkets, 
Carrefour and Atacadao, offer a range of food and non-
food products. Carrefour SA’s supermarket chains include, 
among others, Champion and Norte brands, which primarily 
offer food, clothing and household goods. The company’s 
hard discount stores include Dia, Ed and Minipreco, and 
offer products at discount prices. Its convenience stores, 
such as Shopi and 8 a Huit, offer a range of convenience 
products and services. Carrefour SA’s cash-and-carry 
stores, Promocash, Gross and Docks Market, offer whole-
sale products for businesses. As of December 31, 2009, the 
company was 10.69 percent owned by Blue Capital. 
 Anyone observing Carrefour over the last three decades 
must concede that international expansion is a key part of 
its strategic plan. Despite this, in 2008, 47 percent of its 
sales were in France alone and 81 percent in Europe. The 
19 percent of sales outside the region were evenly divided 
across Asia and Latin America. By 2010, 42 percent of its 
sales were in France and 75 percent in Europe, 17 percent 
in Latin American and 8 percent in Asia. Carrefour is under 
pressure in its home market France as rivals keep prices 
low to gain market share.  
 In 1996, the French government introduced the “Raffarin 
law” to restrict the expansion of hypermarkets, with the 
aim of keeping the French countryside from turning into 
large warehouse-style retail structures. This in turn would 
protect the French way of life, in which local food farmers 
supply small local shops. For Carrefour, this meant that 
growth of its hypermarket business could come only from 
acquisitions in its local market or from expanding into 
foreign markets. Its success at following this strategy has 
varied considerably because of different competitive en-
vironments and cultural differences across regions. 
 In the United States, Carrefour opened three hyper-
markets in Pennsylvania and closed them as a result of 
local competition. In its home region of Europe, however, 
Carrefour is the number one retailer in Spain, Portugal, 
and Greece, and the second largest in Italy. 
 Carrefour was the first Western hypermarket company 
to expand into the Asian market in the mid-1990s. By 2001 
it was the third-largest retailer in China and had oper-
ations in Thailand and Japan. The company bet that Asian 
customers would be willing to move from their traditional 
outdoor markets to purchase at air-conditioned and “all 
under one roof” hypermarkets. These hypermarkets rely 
on local suppliers that could offer products at the same 
price level as those that supplied the local competition and 
cater to the tastes of locals. For their part, local suppliers 
are all too ready to enter contracts with Carrefour, which 
promises to put their products on shelves across the Asian 
region. Moreover, where local contacts are not readily 
available or insufficient, Carrefour’s competitive advantage 
comes from centralized purchasing and other logistics. 
 Because products are offered in a comfortable environ-
ment at competitive prices, the local competition is noth-
ing to worry about. In fact, Carrefour is more concerned 
about competition from other Western retailers such as 
Wal-Mart and Tesco. Both Tesco and Carrefour raced to 
open the first hypermarket in the Thai market and basically 
tied. Both their hypermarkets faced each other in a busy 
Bangkok street. If they want to survive in the long haul, 
however, Western companies should always be wary of 
potential local or regional competitors. In Hong Kong,

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
where Jardine Matheson and Li Ka-shing dominate the 
market, Carrefour was forced to close operations. The 
group now sees strong potential for further international 
growth in the large national markets of China, Brazil, 
Indonesia, Poland, and Turkey. 
 But the benefits of international expansion are not 
completely clear. Carrefour and other large retailers have 
tended to enjoy higher operating margins in their domes-
tic markets. They have also struggled to leverage scale 
economies on a global basis because in order to cater to 
local tastes, hypermarkets must purchase from local pro-
ducers. Indeed, in November 2010, Carrefour announced 
the signing of an agreement with Big C, a subsidiary of 
Groupe Casino (France), for the divestment of its operations in 
Thailand for an enterprise value of €868 million. Carrefour 
plans to sell 19 stores in Malaysia and 2 in Singapore. 
Carrefour shut down its Xian outlet in China’s Shaanxi 
Province in July 2010. 
 On the other hand, Carrefour SA announced the opening 
of its first Cash & Carry Store in India in December 2010. 
With a sales area of 5,200 m 2 , this store located east of 
New Delhi in the Shahadra neighborhood will offer more 
than 10,000 stock-keeping units in food and non-food to 
professional businesses, institutions, restaurants, and 
local retailers. Carrefour opened three supermarkets by 
end of 2010 and two hypermarkets in 2011 in Romania. The 
supermarkets were opened in the capital Bucharest, in the 
southern town of Targoviste and in the northwestern town 
of Cluj. The hypermarkets slated for a 2011 launch were 
located in Bucharest and in northern town of Botosani. 
Carrefour SA currently has 23 hypermarkets and 29 super-
markets in Romania. 
 In 2011, shares in Carrefour have fallen 6 percent after 
Europe’s biggest retailer issued a warning that profits in 
its core French market were set to fall, as it is facing fierce 
competition from rivals in France.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Japan is arguably the odd one out of the three triad regions of the 
world. Political, social, cultural, and economic differences underpin 
its unique business infrastructure and the strengths and weaknesses 
of its firms, relative to competitors from elsewhere. Historically it has 
undergone a period of unprecedented growth and internationalization 
and more recently recession, and this process of change helps explain 
this uniqueness. To understand what is so unusual about the current 
period for Japan, and why the ongoing corporate restructuring is so 
fundamental, we need to understand something of this past. 
 This chapter has a number of aims. By providing an overview of the key 
economic, political, social, and cultural characteristics of Japan we can 
understand more about the Japanese market and the opportunities and 
constraints it represents for foreign firms. We can also understand more 
about Japanese corporations: how and why are they different and what 
are the implications for collaborators and competitors? 
 Such insights are important for firms defending their own domestic 
markets against Japanese MNEs, for foreign firms breaking into the 
Japanese market, and for MNEs acquiring or partnering Japanese firms 
or recruiting Japanese employees. At a broader level, by making the links 
between national characteristics and corporate behavior explicit we can 
improve our understanding of the sources of differences between countries 
and help managers operate more effectively at the international level. The 
approach used here for Japan can be applied to other countries whose 
markets present opportunities or whose firms present competitive threats. 1 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  the underlying factors—economic, political, social, and 
cultural—that underlie the distinctiveness of Japan, its business 
practices, and its corporations.  
 2  Understand  why Japan is a difficult but rewarding market for 
foreign firms to enter.  
 3  Identify  key strengths and weaknesses of Japanese firms.  
 4  Explore  the ongoing changes in Japan and the implications for 
Japanese firms, their collaborators, and their competitors.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Japan is the third-largest economy in the world after the 
United States and China. For this and other reasons it is 
attractive for foreign multinational firms, large and small. 
It is also very different from other countries—politically, 
economically, and culturally—and these differences can 
present major challenges for market entrants. 
 There are a number of reasons for the imbalance in 
outward–inward trade and foreign direct investment in 
Japan. It is a tough, competitive market, characterized until 
recently by relatively closed interfirm business networks 
and a unique political, legal, and institutional infrastruc-
ture. Surveys and case studies of foreign firms in Japan 
reveal the difficulties many of them have faced and how 
they have adapted to succeed. They also reveal how things 
have changed over the years. 
 Prior to the “lost decade” of the 1990s Japan was lucra-
tive but expensive and relatively attractive but restrictive. 
The major problem for foreign firms was the high basic 
costs of operating in Japan, including office rents, a high 
tax burden, staff costs (for local personnel and expatri-
ates), materials, and other inputs. Firms also reported 
major recruitment problems and difficulties keeping 
good Japanese staff, partly because the lack of lifetime 
employment practices and poor social status meant that 
many Japanese were reluctant to work for foreign firms. 
Complex employment legislation and very different human 
resource management practices also added to the effort 
required to establish an effective local business. 
 A variety of market restrictions also faced firms, many 
stemming from the entrenched  keiretsu  networks, both 
upstream (between buyers and suppliers) and downstream 
(between producers, distributors, and retailers). Most 
Japanese firms had long-term relationships with buyers and 
suppliers characterized by reciprocal trust rather than short-
term contractual or price-based arrangements. Breaking 
these ties by doing business with outsiders could affect these 
local relationships, so despite the potential for short-term 
gains, it tended to be avoided. A wide range of government-
related obstacles, including binding red tape and uncertain 
regulations pertaining to foreigners and foreign companies, 
also created additional constraints for foreign firms in Japan. 
 In some cases these barriers to foreign entrants were the 
result of active protectionism, by colluding firms and their 
trade associations and various other coordinating agencies, 
or by the Japanese government itself. In the late 1980s and 
early 1990s political lobbying over alleged restrictive prac-
tices, particularly by the US administration, was at its height. 
In 1989, for example, the Japanese government bowed to US 
pressure and reformed the Large Retail Store Law to allow 
Toys “
R
” Us to open a superstore. This was a high-profile 
case because of the bilateral negotiations between the United 
States and Japan that led to the change. Toys “
R
” Us went 
on to open 64 stores. But the Large Retail Store Law still 
remained to protect small retailers and indirectly supported 
the tied distribution networks of large  keiretsu , creating 
additional barriers for foreign firms. It was again challenged 
in 1997 as part of another high-profile case by Kodak, 
against Fuji. This time the case was taken to the World Trade 
Organization, which ruled in favor of Fuji. Most recently, 
aided by further reforms to the legislation, Costco and Wal-
Mart from the United States (see the Wal-Mart takes Seiyu 
case study later in this chapter) and Carrefour of France are 
aggressively challenging traditional network structures and 
attempting to eliminate costly local wholesalers.  
 More often than the direct actions of Japanese govern-
ment agencies or collusion among corporate groupings, 
the above constraints for foreign firms in Japan simply 
stemmed from differences in Japanese business infra-
structures, legislative mechanisms, management prac-
tices, and consumer preferences. As with any overseas 
market, foreign firms have to adapt or they will fail to 
succeed. Foreign managers have also cited competition 
with Japanese companies and the strictness of orders 
from Japanese customers in terms of quality, delivery, and 
after-sales service as key constraints in the past. But these 
are innate characteristics of doing business in Japan and 
two key reasons why Japanese firms themselves are so 
innovative. Successfully developing a business in Japan is 
an excellent test of a firm’s competitive advantages. 
 The extended downturn in Japan’s domestic market in 
the 1990s and early 2000s made it less attractive but easier

CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
to enter Japan. Government deregulation, the loosening of 
 keiretsu  ties, and changing consumer preferences helped 
foreign investors. Foreign companies also cited falls in land 
prices, office rent, and utility costs as specific improvements 
in the Japanese business environment. Similarly, reduced 
distribution costs and improvements in the availability of 
qualified personnel were also seen as important factors. 
 The Japanese government has taken steps to improve 
access for foreign firms, partly to increase consumer choice 
and stimulate spending and partly to expose local firms to out-
side competition. Policies aimed at tax reduction and favorable 
legal and institutional reforms, such as amendments to the 
Commercial Code of Japan, alongside improvements in labor 
market flexibility, have helped to increase FDI into Japan. 
 There are, however, more fundamental changes taking 
place that are probably more important for foreign entrants. 
The changing economic climate of the early and mid-2000s, 
particularly the high costs of manufacturing and depressed 
consumer demand, has resulted in a growing preference 
among consumers to buy cheaper, non-Japanese products 
and a need for Japanese firms to buy from abroad. Long-
term  keiretsu  networks have loosened considerably, open-
ing up supplier, distribution, and retailing opportunities to 
foreign firms. Social and cultural changes also mean that 
younger Japanese are much more enthusiastic to work for 
non-Japanese firms, although senior, experienced managers 
are still relatively difficult to recruit. 
 More recent entrants to Japan and established foreign 
firms expanding their presence are a testimony to these 
changing conditions and the continued promise of the 
Japanese market. These include the French firm AXA Non-
Life Insurance, Miele, the German household appliances 
company, and Dyson, the British vacuum cleaner manu-
facturer. Dyson Japan was established in 1998 and has 
seen a steady increase in sales, extending its reach to 680 
retailers via mass merchandisers and department store 
networks and achieving a 13 percent market share by 2010. 
 The British retailer Tesco increased its commitment to 
the Japanese market by acquiring the neighborhood super-
market business of Fre’c via its wholly owned subsidiary, C 
Two Network Co. in 2004–5. It had already expanded suc-
cessfully to control 77 stores since its initial entry in 1994, 
partly by buying C Two Network in 2003. Following modest 
growth in Japan, but on the back of success in other global 
markets Tesco opened its first “Tesco Express” in Japan in 
2007, hoping to succeed by promoting its own brand, where 
many others had already failed. By 2011 it managed 140 
stores, selling via both its Tesco brand and a local brand, 
Tsurukame. However, despite being the world’s third-largest 
retailer it still struggles to develop its presence and boost 
sales in Japan. 
 Although there has been change in Japan, the key les-
sons from managers who have experienced this change also 
emphasize the continued importance of traditional Japanese 
practices. For newcomers they suggest the following: 
 ■   Research the culture, the market, the competition, and 
the relevant network affiliations.  
 ■   Understand that in Japan more than any other market 
“the customer is king,” quality is paramount, and a 
deep-rooted service philosophy is required.  
 ■   Be patient (“wait on the stone”) and show long-term 
commitment; personal and corporate reputation is 
important and takes time to develop.  
 ■   Show sensitivity in all interaction: social gatherings are 
important and rituals and hierarchy have to be respected.  
 ■   Invest to adapt products, services, marketing, and man-
agement style.  
 ■   Continually innovate, stay ahead of the competition.  
 ■   Use Japan to learn, to improve, and to access other 
Asian markets.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Between 1950 and 1973 Japanese GDP grew at an unparalleled average annual rate of 8 per-
cent, over three times the growth rates of the UK and the United States in this period and 
similar to current growth rates in China. The OECD itself noted this by observing: “by the 
conventional measures of economic performance (income growth, inﬂ ation, unemploy-
ment) Japan has out-performed all other OECD economies since entry into the organiz-
ation in 1964.” 2 How did this happen? 
 Since 1973 until recently Japan’s average rate of growth has remained at 3 percent per 
year. Then, in the last half of the 1990s, the Japanese economy grew at half the OECD 
average (which was 2.8 percent), and by the end of the 1990s it recorded unprecedented 
negative growth, shrinking by more than 2 percent. More recently it has shown signs of 
recovery, but is still undergoing a period of restructuring as it comes to terms with the end 
of a long era of continued growth and stability. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 The 128 million people of Japan are heavily concentrated in the coastal areas and urban 
regions because of the mountainous nature of the country. Over half of the population 
lives in and around the three main metropolitan areas of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, with 
Greater Tokyo having a population of 30 million. 
 Up until the end of the 1980s Japan could be characterized politically, socially, and cul-
turally as a highly stable, conservative, and homogeneous country. Economic change since 
then has been both driven by and a driving force for change across all of these dimensions. 
To understand the current dynamics affecting the Japanese market, its firms, and its man-
agers we must understand something of its political and social heritage. 
  A traditionally strong government role in the economy 
 The branches of the Japanese government are most similar to those in the United States: 
legislative, executive, and judicial. Legislative power is vested in the Diet, which consists of 
a popularly elected House of Representatives and House of Councilors. The conservative 
Liberal-Democratic Party has been in power for most of the postwar period with the sup-
port of the powerful business and agriculture lobbies. 
 Executive power rests with the Cabinet, which is organized and headed by the prime 
minister, who is elected by the Diet. In addition to the office of the prime minister, there 
are 17 ministerial divisions in the executive branch. Judicial power is vested in the Supreme 
Court and there are eight high courts and numerous district courts throughout the country. 
Overall, Japan is divided into 47 prefectures. Each local political subdivision, including 
cities, towns, and villages, has its own executive power and operates within the scope of 
the national law. 
 Two key ministries were at the heart of Japan’s postwar reconstruction, the boom years 
of rapid growth and, arguably, some elements of its more recent recession. The   Ministry 
for Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI)  , created in 2001, was previously the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which was established in 1951. It was respon-
sible for leading the selective liberalization of the economy and trade particularly in the 
1960s and 1970s. It used its strong control to target, promote, and coordinate specific tech-
nologies and industry groups to spearhead the national economic development program. 
The   Ministry of Finance (MOF)   was also highly influential in steering the developing and

internationalizing economy via its control over prices and currency exchange in the early 
days of growth. 
 One of the more unusual systems that helped coordinate decision making and main-
tain the consensus among MITI, MOF, and various key flagship firms was the practice of 
  amakudari   . This involved the regular movement of senior politicians and civil servants 
from the public sector into private-sector companies, often as highly paid consultants.  
 These two ministries connected with other ministries and government agencies 
to influence the evolution of specific forms of business infrastructure, corporate 
strengths (and weaknesses), and interfirm business practices. The Ministry of Post and 
Telecommunications (MPT) and MITI, for example, jointly guided the development of 
NTT, the national telecoms carrier; its supplier group, including NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, 
and Oki; and its de-nationalization and partial break-up during the 1990s. 3 
 The early 1990s saw the start of a series of restructurings in Japanese politics, following 
over a decade when government influence over the economy and, in particular, the strat-
egies of the major firms became increasingly weak. Both the lead political parties and the 
powerful civil service bureaucracies below them were pushed to justify their roles, respon-
sibilities, and connections with corporate Japan. 
 However, government in Japan still arguably plays a more important role in the 
economy and as an influence over corporate strategy than in other OECD countries. 
Agricultural and foods-related sectors, the construction industry, and financial services, 
for example, are still very strongly influenced by government via a number of governance 
mechanisms. 
 Distinctive cultural characteristics 
 Although cultural factors are often overemphasized in discussions of Japanese economic 
strength, there are some distinctive social and cultural elements that underlie the country’s 
success. As described in  Chapter 5 , the cultural frameworks of Hofstede and Trompenaars 
indicate a low level of individualism and a high level of uncertainty avoidance compared to 
Western cultures, reﬂ ected in the high priority placed on rituals, routines, and procedures 
in organizations and society in general. The Japanese are relatively neutral or unemotional 
in the workplace and prefer more objective rather than subjective forms of decision mak-
ing. They are also diffuse, in Trompenaars’ terminology, with a high correlation between 
hierarchical relationships in the workplace and social status outside the workplace. 
 A strong sense of collectivism rather than individualism tends to dominate many 
aspects of Japanese life. Whether work related or outside work, clubs, groups, and societies 
exist at all levels and people will tend to belong to several, with a distinct ranking in each 
according to its focus and their age and experience. 
 Within companies certain characteristics have strong religious roots, including honor, 
respect, sincerity, loyalty (   chu   ), duty, obligation or responsibility (   giri   ), ritual, and hierar-
chy. These are all central pillars of Japanese society in general and are sometimes referred 
to as the Japanese Code. At various levels parent–child relationships characterize the 
hierarchical nature of inter-organizational and interpersonal links, such as government–
industry, large firm–small firm, manager–employee, and so on. 4  Respect for elders, ritual-
istic (and highly complex) language forms and behavior, group activities, and consensus 
decision making are all important elements. These contrast individualism and meritocratic 
forms of organization and tend overall to unify the Japanese in their response to    gaijin  or 
outsiders. 
 Many of these characteristics are nurtured in the strong Japanese school system. This is 
characterized by a centrally regulated curriculum (dominated by Monbusho, the Ministry 
of Education, Science, and Culture): conformist attitudes among pupils, teachers, and

parents; high standards; and a focus on factual learning and the sciences. As a result of 
this educational focus Japan has double the number of scientists and engineers per head 
of population than the UK. 
 There is a significant amount of competition to get into good schools but a lack of 
competition between pupils once in school (“the nail that sticks out will be hammered 
down” is a local saying frequently used to describe this conformity). There is also a strong 
correlation between the level and place of education and job opportunities for school or 
university leavers, particularly at the top end of the business and civil service hierarchies: 
50 percent of Japanese school leavers attend university or higher education colleges and 
75 percent of the 480 Japanese universities are private. 5 
 We get a small insight into the difficulties created for non-Japanese by the complexities 
of Japanese culture if we consider the    hai  dilemma.  Hai  can mean one of at least four levels 
of yes: recognition, but not necessarily understanding; understanding, but not necessarily 
acceptance and agreement; responsibility, understanding, but must consult with others 
and secure their agreement before acceptance; and agreement, which means understand-
ing, agreement, and acceptance. The non-verbal signals from the speaker have to be under-
stood to determine which yes is being meant.

necessarily mean “yes I 
agree,” but “yes, I hear

What kinds of challenges are foreign managers likely to meet when trying to 
set up a subsidiary office in Japan and recruit local employees? 
 One way to answer this question would be to examine the political, economic, and cultural 
issues in turn. Political challenges include the legislation for registering local companies, 
licensing, taxation, visas for foreign nationals, and employment regulations. Economic 
challenges include the costs of premises and business services. But there are other 
costs, less easy to estimate, that result from the extra time and effort needed to develop 
customer relationships and adapt to Japanese business practices. All of the above chal-
lenges would involve a degree of cultural learning, given that they involve interaction with 
and an understanding of local people and organizations. Recruiting, managing, and keep-
ing Japanese employees, however, represents one of the biggest challenges for foreign 
managers. Failure to adapt human resource management practices, incentive schemes, 
the organizational structure and hierarchy, the definition of roles and responsibilities, and 
decision-making systems to develop an efficient, motivated local workforce undermines 
many foreign firms’ market-entry strategies in Japan.   
 Japan is very big and highly competitive. The unusual nature of its rapid growth in the 
early years stemmed from factors such as the traditional relationship between government 
and business, its unique capital markets (national ﬁ nance and investment systems), its tra-
ditionally strong    keiretsu    groupings of ﬁ rms, the role of the corporation in society, and the 
role of the employee in the ﬁ rm. These are all linked to its unique social and cultural char-
acteristics, leading many commentators to characterize Japan as having a different form of 
capitalism.

 The size of the Japanese economy, combined with its productivity and the average 
wealth of its 128 million people, make it the third-largest economy in the world after the 
United States and China. Other general characteristics include its large (though declining) 
trade imbalance and even larger imbalance in FDI, compared to its triad counterparts (see 
 Tables  18.1 ,  18.2 ,  18.3 ).

 This imbalance, coupled with the trade dependence on the US market, resulted in the 
long-running US–Japan trade conflict during the 1980s. Japan’s growth period was marked 
by increased exports (still reflected in its export profile; see  Figure   18.1   ) and outward 
FDI, but for some time its domestic market remained relatively closed to competitors for 
a variety of reasons. More recently, linked to the domestic market recession, imports of 
cheaper products, particularly from China, have created a more balanced trade profile (see 
 Figure   18.2   ). Trade and FDI trends in the 2000s show that Japan’s economy is becoming 
more integrated within the Asia region and developing particularly strong economic ties 
with China. Both output (market-oriented) expansion and input (resource or production-
oriented) expansion opportunities are being created for Japanese firms by the growth of 
the Asian economic region.

CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
 Japan is home to around a quarter of the top 100 MNEs. The kinds of sectors repre-
sented in this list of top firms, together with Japan’s trade profile and sources of outward 
FDI, all point to a surprisingly narrow range of industry strengths. Its competitive su-
periority has always been limited to relatively few key sectors, as is the case for most other 
economies. 
 In the early 1990s just four industries—non-electrical machinery, electrical machin-
ery, transport machinery, and precision machinery—accounted for 75 percent of total 
Japanese exports. Three product areas—motor vehicles and parts, consumer electronics, 
and electronic components—were responsible for about one-third of exports. The same 
industry niches were responsible for the growth of FDI (primarily in production activities) 
and of foreign sales of Japanese firms. 6  Other data also show how the success of Japanese 
firms, expressed in terms of the proportion of overseas to total sales, has also been rather 
limited. 7  Their size, as is the case for many US firms, reflects success in their large domestic 
and regional markets rather than their global competitiveness. 
 In his 1990 book  The Competitive Advantage of Nations , Michael Porter uses Japan to 
illustrate both the importance of local  rivalry  and  demanding customers  as driving forces 
behind the evolution of innovative, competitive firms. As shown above, Japan’s strong

export performance is based around relatively few industries, initially steel and shipbuild-
ing and heavy engineering, then later capital goods production, car manufacturing, elec-
trical engineering, and consumer electronics. In all these sectors very tough competition 
between many local firms battling for market share (rather than profits) pushed each com-
petitor to develop new products, more rapidly at lower costs. The large number of firms 
in key industry sectors promoted this rivalry. During its rapid growth phase the country 
had, for example, 9 indigenous car manufacturers (whereas the United States had only 3), 
10 large electronics groups, and over 115 companies producing machine tools, again far 
more per capita than the United States. 
 At the same time, tough markets and demanding customers at home pushed Japanese 
companies to cut costs and emphasize quality, personal service, and buyer-led product 
customization, all of which came to underlie their global competitiveness during later 
periods of export-driven growth. Toyota, for example, initially pioneered lean production 
techniques in the 1950s as a way of lowering costs to undercut local competitors, not to 
promote international competitiveness. 8 
  Japan and China: the new Asian powerhouse? 
 Trade and FDI ﬂ ows between Japan and China are growing particularly quickly, raising the 
potential of a powerful axis of economic growth in Asia. The combination of Japan’s tech-
nological leadership in speciﬁ c industry sectors, its excellence in manufacturing and pro-
cess innovation, its large, wealthy market, and its footholds in Europe and the United States, 
together with China’s low-cost manufacturing base and its evolving, large but low-income 
market, sets the stage for a very strong regional partnership. However, the turbulent geo-
political history and distinct cultural and social differences between the two nations may 
well undermine this partnership, or at least limit the pace at which it develops. 
 The growing importance of the trading relationship between China and Japan is shown 
clearly in Figures 18.1 and 18.2. Imports from China have grown dramatically, particu-
larly imports of IT products as China surpassed the US to become the major source of 
IT imports into Japan. Japan also imported more motorcycles and consumer electronic 
products made by Chinese manufacturers. Exports from Japan to China have also substan-
tially increased partly due to buoyant demand for products such as automobiles. At the 
end of 2007, China overtook the United States to become Japan’s major trading partner, 
accounting for over 17 percent of exports. The overall trade deficit with China remained 
at $18 billion. This had lessened by the end of the decade as significant jumps in bilateral 
trade took place in 2010–2011.   
 Having explored some aspects of the political, social, and economic environment in which 
Japanese ﬁ rms have evolved, we now move on to examine some of the factors underlying 
Japan’s economic success. This success in the 1970s and 1980s led to a fear among Western 
observers that the Japanese had developed an alternative model of market capitalism that 
would outperform incumbent ﬁ rms in the United States and Europe. High-proﬁ le articles 
and books on the Japanese threat fed this fear. 9  This also prompted some useful, in-depth 
research that sought to understand what factors underpinned this success. These include 
distinctive strengths in manufacturing operations, strong applied research and develop-
ment (R&D), the  keiretsu  corporate networks, and domestic distribution and retailing sys-
tems that connect companies and customers.

CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
 Manufacturing strengths 
 The most detailed comparative studies involving Japanese manufacturers have been carried 
out in the auto sector looking, for example, at productivity, manufacturing efﬁ ciency, con-
tinuous process improvement, design quality, return on R&D, and new product develop-
ment. The success of Japanese ﬁ rms in this sector is shown by the fact that on average (up 
until the end of the 1980s) they produced new models of cars with only 55 percent of the 
engineering hours required by US and European manufacturers, maintaining development 
lead times that were over 15 months shorter, and sold the cars at a retail price that was, on 
average, 30 percent lower than competing models from the United States and Europe. 10 
 A variety of attributes underlie Japanese manufacturing competitiveness, and while 
detailed accounts can be found in numerous other sources, some of the main ones are 
listed here: 
 ■   Attention to quality (built in at every stage of development and production processes), 
often formalized in quality circles (QC) and total quality management (TQM) but 
related much more to each individual employee’s concern for flawless output.  
 ■   Strong manufacturer–component supplier linkages (coordinated initial development 
and subsequent innovation), again formalized within just-in-time (JIT) systems but 
reliant for their success on the close, informal  keiretsu relationships between buyers and 
suppliers.  
 ■   Ability to cut production costs (using advanced manufacturing technology, JIT, and 
flexible and lean manufacturing techniques).  
 ■   A high level of automation and use of robotics (increasingly used to control costs as the 
yen appreciated). 
 ■   Higher degree of credibility and responsibility given to engineers and technical expertise.  
 ■  Kaizen,   or continuous improvement, and a focus at all levels on incremental produc-
tivity improvement and customer-led product development. 
 Strong applied R&D 
 Japan has traditionally spent more than most other countries on R&D, consistently invest-
ing over 3 percent of the nation’s GDP on R&D. This compares to around 2.5 percent in 
the USA and less than 2 percent on average in the EU27. The recent shift, however, has 
been the rise of China which overtook Japan in 2010 to become the second-largest R&D 
investor after the US. In Japan, however, over 75 percent of R&D funding comes from indus-
try, the highest among OECD countries and higher than in China. Contrary to popular myth 
the Japanese government has always spent relatively smaller amounts on R&D compared to 
other advanced countries (this is partly related to the low level of defense spending). 
 At one time Hitachi, Toyota, Matsushita, NEC, and Fujitsu, the top five R&D spenders 
in Japan, spent as much (in terms of purchasing power parity) as the total R&D expenditure 
of the entire private sector in the UK. 11  Up until the late 1980s this R&D was predominantly 
applied or near-market R&D. Japan only started to catch up in terms of more basic blue-
sky R&D, moving to the scientific frontiers in some technologies, in the last 15 to 20 years.   
 Keiretsu 
 The renowned Japanese corporate groupings, or  keiretsu , characterized by cross-
shareholdings and regular meetings between executives, represent more or less closely tied 
groups of integrated businesses. There are broadly two types of  keiretsu , the horizontal 
(  kinyu   ) type and the vertical, manufacturing  keiretsu . Both are undergoing radical change, 
as described later in this chapter. 12 
 Kaizen 
  Normally taken to mean 
“continuous improvement” 
and is associated with 
lean or low-cost, high-
productivity manufacturing. 
A more accurate 
interpretation is “to 
dismantle and reassemble 
a process to make it 
better.” As such  kaizen was

 Many of the former are descended from the prewar    zaibatsu  conglomerates, which 
the allied forces attempted to break up in the late 1940s. Three of the top six are direct 
descendents of the prewar  zaibatsu : Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo. The remaining 
three, Fuyo/Fuji, Sanwa, and Dai-lchi Kangyo, are more like centralized holding com-
panies. These top six alone directly accounted for about 5 percent of the Japanese labor 
force and 16 percent of total Japanese corporate sales in the early 1980s. But their cross-
shareholding networks and their influence across and down the main corporate hierarchies 
in Japan were far more prevalent than these figures suggest.  
 The Fuyo  keiretsu ( Fuyo-kai ) is shown in  Figure   18.3   , prior to its restructuring. It 
typifies the horizontal-type  keiretsu , with a central bank and    sogo shosha  , or international 
trading company, and a diversified range of interests. These firms played a major role in 
bringing Japanese products to the world markets in the growth phase and underpin the 
global FDI network of many Japanese firms today.  
 Many of these Japanese banks once dominated the world rankings in asset terms, includ-
ing Dai-lchi Kangyo Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Fuji Bank, and Sakura Bank. Commercial 
banks in Japan have always been oriented more toward corporate clients than individual 
customers compared to Western banks. Unlike arm’s-length shareholders in the West, with 
short-term repayment horizons, Japanese banks and other shareholders (usually affiliated 
companies, suppliers, distributors, or associated companies) will have built a long-term 
commitment to supporting  keiretsu  member companies and their employees. As a result 
capital markets in Japan have not traditionally emphasized return on investment (ROI) 
and dividends. Corporations have been much freer from the constraints and demands 
of shareholders and allowed to manage for long-term growth and continue  keiretsu con-
nections and loyalty to employees. This form of capitalism has significant benefits in a 
continually growing economy. But it also has weaknesses and can be an inefficient system 
for resource allocation as has become much more apparent in Japan’s recessionary period. 
Subsequently, there have been fundamental changes to the structure of capital markets in 
Japan in recent years, as we will see below. 
 At one time Mitsubishi was said to be the most tightly woven  keiretsu , based in 
Tokyo’s business district, Marunouchi, which as a result was called Mitsubishi Village. 
It had over 216,000 employees in businesses ranging throughout the financial, manu-
facturing, services, and trading sectors from heavy engineering and oil to aerospace and 
beer. The 29 companies at the heart of the group held an average of 38 percent of each 
other’s shares, a high proportion even for Japanese corporate groups. 13  These com panies 
exchanged directors, cross-financed one another, and engaged in joint investment 
and cooperative research projects for the benefit of the whole group. Information 
exchange and interfirm coordination are initiated at the most senior level and the 
presidents and chairmen of the 29 core firms still meet for lunch in Marunouchi on 
the second Friday of each month for the   Mitsubishi  Kinyokai   , or Friday Club. Within 
the 29 core companies are an even closer-knit group, the members of which share the 
Mitsubishi name. The proportion of stable shareholders among this group stood at over 
70 percent in 1996 and has since fallen to about 30 percent. The case  International 
Business Strategy in Action: Kirin Beer goes international  describes one of the com-
panies in the Mitsubishi Group.  
 The newer, vertical  keiretsu  are headed by large manufacturers (Hitachi, Matsushita 
Electric Industrial, Toyota, and NEC, for example) and tend to belong to a particular 
manufacturing sector. Here the relationships are between suppliers, a flagship manufac-
turer and distributors and retailers, in a vertical value chain. Close information exchange, 
cross-shareholding, personnel exchanges, and joint ventures support excellence in supply-
chain management, new product development, standardized IT and logistics, quality and 
service assurance, and the sharing of management best practices.

 At one time Matsushita, for example, had around 500 prime contractors, or first-level sup-
pliers, and over 6,000 smaller suppliers at lower levels of what is known as a   co-prosperity 
pyramid   or cooperative manufacturing  keiretsu . Toyota, by comparison, once had 168 first-
tier suppliers, 4,000 second-tier, and around 32,000 third-tier, according to one estimate. 
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at the lower levels may rely on two or three top 
customers for over 50 percent of their revenue, making them both highly cooperative (that 
is, willing to change component price or specifications to the buyer’s requirements at short 
notice) and very dependent on the fortunes of manufacturers further up the hierarchy.

How have keiretsu networks limited foreign firms entering the Japanese 
market in the past and how is this now changing? 
 The degree to which  keiretsu  networks will affect foreign firms’ success in the Japanese 
market partly depends on which industry or business they are in. In the past, foreign 
entrants have found it very difficult to find willing suppliers or distributors because many 
local firms have been tied into long-term relationships with other  keiretsu members. 
Traditionally these long-term relationships have meant that foreign firms will be disadvan-
taged when competing against local firms, regardless of the relative price or benefits of 
their product or service. Consumers and corporate purchasing departments have tended to 
show a strong bias toward local brands and local producers. Since the recession, however, 
price has become more important as a selection criterion and  keiretsu structures have 
loosened, providing more opportunities for foreign firms. Imported products, discount 
stores (bypassing the complex distribution systems), and direct sales have all become 
acceptable. Japanese firms of all sizes are actively seeking links with firms outside their 
traditional networks and outside Japan as part of their changing business strategies.  
 Kirin Beer goes international 
 The establishment of the Japan Brewery Company, Ltd. in 
the late 1880s was a truly international affair. It involved, 
at various stages and in various roles, a Norwegian, an 
Englishman, a Scotsman, and a number of Japanese, 
Americans, and Germans. The symbol of the Kirin, a mythi-
cal Eastern cross between a horse and a dragon denoting 
good fortune, was chosen as its main brand from the start. 
The firm is the largest beer producer in Japan and one of 
the four dominant players in the industry alongside Asahi, 
Sapporo, and Suntory. Its main products are Kirin Lager and 
Ichiban Shibori, with Kirin Tanrei as Japan’s leading  happo-
shu  (low-malt) beer. Other beverages include canned coffee 
and tea, fruit juices, and soft drinks. Also active in floricul-
ture and pharmaceuticals, Kirin is part of the Mitsubishi 
 keiretsu . In 2010, Kirin revenues was US$24,807 million, of 
which 79 percent was generated in Japan, 18 percent from 
Asia and Oceania and 3 percent from other markets. 
 In recent years the company has been having its share 
of problems. These all started back in the 1970s when 
Kirin held 70 percent of the national market. At this time 
antitrust regulators decided to open the local market to 
other brewers. As a result, Asahi Beer quickly became 
the country’s second-largest brewer, and since then Asahi 
has continued to erode Kirin’s market share with (1) better 
product development; (2) a successful marketing strategy 
with commercials aimed at young, active individuals; and 
(3) a distribution network that introduced what turned out 
to be a growing trend among beer consumers—canned 
beer sold in large supermarkets.

CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
  Distribution, retailing, and customer orientation 
 Associated with the  keiretsu  industry groupings above are multilayered distribution and 
retail networks in Japan. At its height it was estimated that there was one retail outlet for 
every 75 people in Japan (over twice the US ratio) and over 476,000 wholesale stores. These 
are still organized both by region and by sector and product across Japan and tend to be 
geared to the large number of small retailers that serve the local markets. This “tied” system 
 In retrospect, one of Kirin’s biggest mistakes was that 
it was too slow in reacting to competition in a market that 
it long took for granted. For example, despite Asahi’s tac-
tics, Kirin continued to rely heavily on its traditional sales 
approach and its long-established network of “mom-and-
pop” stores across the country. In truth, the company was 
confused regarding how to deal with competition and, as a 
result, made a number of mistakes. When the giant brewer 
decided to increase its marketing effort and create tele-
vision ads directed at young people, the strategy was per-
ceived by many viewers as a poor imitation of Asahi’s own 
advertising strategy and the campaign flopped. As a result 
of such mistakes by Kirin, Asahi continued to gain market 
share and moved into top position with a 41.7 percent share 
of the market for beer and  happo-shu  in 2004. Since then 
the two firms have continued to battle for the top spot, with 
the third-placed supplier, Sapporo, well behind. The beer 
demand in Japan fell for the sixth year in a row. According 
to Mintel Global Market Navigator, in 2010, Kirin was in the 
top position of the beer market share by volume, holding 
37.7 percent, followed by Asahi 37.5 percent, Suntory 
12.3 per cent, Sapporo 11.7 percent and finally Orion 0.8 per-
cent. However, in terms of market share by value (US $), 
Asahi held 40.6 percent, Kirin 35.3 percent, Sapporo 12.0 per-
cent, Suntory 11.2 percent, and Orion 0.8 percent. 
 Partly in an effort to maintain its position in the Japanese 
market, Kirin has worked to exploit its traditional image. 
Kirin Lager, Japan’s oldest brew, is now being promoted as 
the classic Japanese premium beer, the type of beer to enjoy 
with family and friends. And to promote this image with its 
other brews as well, Kirin has begun increasing its advertis-
ing budget. Unfortunately, this new effort faces a number of 
challenges. The biggest one may well be that most Japanese 
beer drinkers admit that all beers taste the same to them—so 
increased advertising may not generate the desired results. 
 As well as competing actively for domestic market share, 
Kirin has expanded abroad. Today its products are avail-
able in 40 nations including the United States, the European 
Union, China, Taiwan, and a host of other Asian coun-
tries. In most instances Kirin has teamed up with a local 
brewer. For example, the company entered into a partner-
ship with Anheuser-Busch that allowed Kirin Beer to be 
brewed in Los Angeles and then shipped to the rest of the 
country. The company also holds a 46 percent stake in Lion 
Nathan Limited, a subsidiary in Australia that has important 
operations in China. Kirin has also invested a 15 percent 
stake in San Miguel Corporation, the dominant brewer in 
the Philippines. So the company is off to a good international 
start. Competitors, however, are also expanding internation-
ally, creating an ongoing need for product differentiation and 
good brand marketing. So Kirin still has a long way to go. 
 One of the things that may help the company is that it 
is part of Mitsubishi, Japan’s largest  keiretsu . Today the 
Mitsubishi Group has over 200 operations in 80 countries 
worldwide. Together with its 500 group companies, 
Mitsubishi employs a global workforce of over 54,000 people; 
29 core members are bound together by cross-ownership 
and other financial ties. Although the members of this 
 keiretsu  operate independently, they can call upon one 
another for help. For example, when Akai Electric had 
financial problems, Mitsubishi Bank rescued it. When 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ shipbuilding business ran into 
trouble, it was able to find work at other group companies 
for those personnel who were laid off. And the cross-
holding structure has also come in handy when warding off 
takeovers. For example, when Texaco bought Getty Oil, it 
was prepared to sell Getty’s 50 percent share of Mitsubishi 
Oil to Kuwait Petroleum. However, the members of the 
Mitsubishi Group got together and outbid the Kuwaitis for 
Getty’s shares. The group has also made important acqui-
sitions and struck major deals in a variety of areas. Mitsubishi 
companies have participated in the $940 million purchase 
of the Pebble Beach Golf Course in California, won a 
$400 million power plant deal in Virginia, and launched 
a $150 million futures trading joint venture in Chicago. 
Overall, Mitsubishi has hundreds of interdependent com-
panies, and they are building an empire that stretches from 
Asia to Europe to the United States. With their help, Kirin 
may be able to become a major international brewer.

of distribution, bound by strong face-to-face ties between sellers and buyers at each level, 
adds substantial costs to the ﬁ nal product. Again, at its peak, the American Chamber of 
Commerce in Japan (ACCJ) found that over 48 percent of home electronics products in 
Japan are sold through exclusively afﬁ liated stores, and about 99 percent of cars are distrib-
uted through exclusive dealerships. 14 
 Many elements of this complex, high-cost distribution remain in Japan today. Ports in 
particular are notoriously protected and relatively slower and more expensive than in other 
OECD countries. The multi-tiered distribution hierarchy has become more simplified, 
however, driven by the growth in discount stores and cost-reduction measures. 15 
 Until recently the strong patriotic preferences of the average Japanese consumer and, 
perhaps, the average Japanese middle manager responsible for company purchasing policy 
provided a firm basis for the country’s industrial and distribution infrastructure. Outside 
the luxury or branded consumer goods markets the Japanese have long had a strong prefer-
ence for Japanese products. 
 Japan is home to around 25 percent of the top 100 multinational ﬁ rms. It is not just a large 
economy and a large market, but a major source of global competitors. Various stereotypes 
underlie popular beliefs about Japanese ﬁ rms that are at best inaccurate and sometimes 
wholly misleading. 
 At one extreme, during the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese firms were seen to exemplify the best 
of all management practices. High-profile articles and books on the Japanese threat fed a gen-
eral fear about the competitive threat they posed and prompted researchers to identify what was 
different about Japan and its firms and how such differences might convey sustained competi-
tive advantages. 16  At the other end of the extreme, the economic and corporate failures of the 
period broadly from 1990 to 2003 have prompted wholesale criticism of the Japanese model. 
 The truth lies somewhere in between. The Japanese economy, culture, and business sys-
tem underpin both relative strengths and weaknesses in Japanese companies. The former 
were very evident during the period of social and political stability and economic growth 
up to the end of the 1980s. The latter have become more apparent since then. 
 Very broadly speaking, two kinds of Japanese corporations have existed for some time. 
On the one hand those firms that have escaped the effects of the extended recession, such 
as Toyota, Honda, Sony, Canon, Sharp, and Toshiba, have been less dependent on the 
Japanese market (more internationalized) for some time. They increasingly sold products 
in markets outside Japan, engaged in FDI abroad, and evolved “less Japanese” styles of 
management well before the recessionary period. They also represent the industries in 
which Japan achieved its high levels of export competitiveness in the growth years, which 
is why we know more about them in the West. 17 
 On the other hand a large number of firms, the majority of Japanese companies in fact, 
including firms like Nippon Steel, Sumitomo Chemical, Mitsubishi, Kajima, and Dentsu, 
are less geographically diversified. They have long remained more dependent on the 
Japanese market, Japanese suppliers, and Japanese ways of doing things. 
 Confirmation of this division comes from the McKinsey Global Institute study which 
shows that although labor productivity in Japan’s top firms (such as those above) is 
20 per cent higher on average than in US firms, they only represent 10 percent of the 
Japanese economy. The other 90 percent of Japanese firms have an average labor produc-
tivity that is 60 percent of US levels. 18 
  Table   18.4    shows the top 40 Japanese firms (from a list of the top 500 multinational 
firms). It also classifies the firms according to their global distribution of sales, showing 
 JAPANESE CORPORATIONS

their relative dependence on their domestic (Japanese) markets. All but a very few are 
highly dependent on their domestic market, and only Sony and Canon are global in that 
they have over 20 percent of their sales in each of the triad regions. Despite the above-
mentioned variations in the structures, strategies, and management styles of Japanese 
firms, there are some common, distinctive characteristics of the stereotypical Japanese 
firm, relative to its European and American counterparts.  
 In one of the most extensive studies of the Japanese enterprise system, Fruin highlights 
high productivity, functional specialization, and manufacturing adaptability as the dis-
tinguishing hallmarks of Japanese firms. He identifies these attributes at three connected 
levels: the factory, the firm, and the interfirm network. 19

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 The various social, cultural, and economic characteristics above combine to create 
certain strengths and weaknesses in Japanese firms. From a wide range of studies 20  we can 
distill some of the main characteristics of the generic Japanese management style, again 
traditionally: 
 ■   Effective communications internally and with outside firms (decentralized, horizontal 
information flows) and the use of   benkyokai   or cross-disciplinary, cross-business, and 
cross-functional workshops. 
 ■  Less separation of R&D, design, manufacturing, and marketing functions. 
 ■   Lifetime employment, low labor mobility, and substantial investments in training. 
There is also a strong emphasis on on-the-job training and job rotation within the firm.  
 ■   Managers as problem definers, not firefighters, and as educators and mentors, not dis-
ciplinarians. This is underpinned by the weak links between performance and pay and 
the low wage differentials between workers and managers in the age-related hierarchy. 
Despite the importance of hierarchy and job titles, average CEO incomes in Japan are 
rarely more than 10 times the salaries of new recruits. In the United States (and increas-
ingly in the UK) there is a much bigger remuneration gap than this.  
 ■   Strong group/team ethic, loyalty, and motivation combined with competitiveness 
between teams.  
 ■   Strict formal hierarchy (based on seniority, rank and title also underpin social status) 
combined with strong underlying informal networks and a tendency toward consensus-
based (  nemawashi and  ringi  ) decision making (horizontal promotion for high fliers 
and a lack of outsiders entering the firm at senior levels). 
 ■   General “long-termism” with a focus on growth, employment stability, and market 
share rather than profits and shareholder dividends.      
 These are obviously generalizations, but are factors that tend to exist more or less in a wide 
range of Japanese firms. Overall, Japanese firms have a strong focus on human resources. A 
great deal of their strength (and a source of some weaknesses) lies in the employer–employee 
relationship and the commitment and loyalty shown by each to the other. 
 This overview of some of the key characteristics of the Japanese has been highly gen-
eralized, aiming to select factors that underpin significant differences in Japan relative to 
other countries. One of the best early books on Japanese firms and business practices called 
 Kaisha  (“company”) by Abegglen and Stalk 21  sums up some of these distinctive character-
istics as the 3Ms: 
 ■  Marketing : direct links with consumers via retailers and wholesalers and strong 
customer-led product development. 
 ■  Money : cross-shareholding and the lack of outside pressure for short-term returns and 
stock price improvements.  
 ■  Manpower strategy : worker involvement, loyalty, effective teamworking and devolve-
ment of responsibility combined with hierarchy.

 The recent past decade has seen a number of major changes in Japan’s social, economic, 
and political structure and this change continues. The added difﬁ culties brought about in 
Japan by the current period of chaotic upheaval is partly related to the unusual degree of 
stability and consensus that the country has experienced throughout a long high-growth era 
that is now over. 
 A CHANGING NATION 

587
CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
 Starting in the early 1990s Japan has experienced its worst economic recession in 
the postwar period. Slower growth, reduced investment, declining property prices, and 
increased unemployment are all secondary effects of earlier declines in profitability, 
increased domestic costs, and falling domestic demand. These were masked in the late 
1980s by rapid growth rates based on strong exports and cheap capital, which ended 
abruptly when the bubble burst and    endaka    began. The recession is linked to the fast 
appreciation of the yen, which partly resulted from the 1985   Plaza Accord and continued 
through the mid-1990s, rising 24 percent in value between early 1993 and early 1995.   
 Between 1990 and 2000, ‘the lost decade’, unemployment grew from 2.1 to 4.7 percent; 
GDP growth fell from 5.1 to 1.9 percent; motor vehicle production fell by 25 percent; 
the sales of large department stores slumped by 13 percent; and residential land prices in 
Tokyo dropped by 55 percent. The knock-on effects are still being felt. 
 Alongside this economic slump, significant social and cultural developments have 
resulted in an unprecedented degree of tension between traditional and modern ways 
of living and working. Some of the broader elements of social change include the aging 
population, changing diet and changing health problems, a rising crime rate (though from 
a very low base rate), new attitudes toward work and leisure and, among some in Japan, 
a perceived decline in moral values (among others, a new freedom and social openness). 
 Japan’s social homogeneity proved to be a strength in the period of rapid economic 
development of the past, but may well prove increasingly to be a weakness as it becomes 
more international. As the country becomes less isolated from the rest of the world the 
individualistic, Western aspirations of the younger Japanese increasingly clash with the 
more conservative, group-oriented nature of the older Japanese. The latter are largely 
responsible for the rapid economic development of Japan in the postwar period through 
their hard work and their emphasis on building rather than enjoying prosperity. 
  Shinjinrui  (“new human being”) is a term that the Japanese have used to describe the younger 
generation as well as some of the more well-traveled middle-aged citizens who are pushing at 
the social restrictions that emphasize education, training, and work above personal pleasure, 
leisure, and family. At the same time a greater degree of interaction with other countries and 
cultures, plus a growing number of foreigners visiting, working, and living in Japan, are forc-
ing many Japanese to compromise what has been termed their ethnocentric view of the world. 
 Some of the most obvious changes are seen in the buying patterns of Japanese consumers. 
Beyond a long-term move to Western foods and clothing styles there has also been a grow-
ing preference for “value for money” and an increase in buying from previously frowned-
upon foreign firms and discount retail stores. This is partly because of the recessionary 
pressure on wages but is also an indication that consumers are beginning to realize and 
object to the fact that Japan’s consumer prices were well over the OECD average. 
 This change in consumer behavior, alongside the increasingly price-oriented, cost-
cutting objectives of manufacturers, has challenged the multilayered distribution system 
that has dominated wholesale and retail networks in Japan. A flatter distribution system 
has begun to develop, pioneered by discount stores and direct importers, like the Daiei 
chain, which has experienced a boom in its own-label brands, allowing it to cut prices by 
using imported products, from Brazilian orange juice to Korean video tapes. 
 We will now examine some specific aspects of change in Japan: the restructuring of the 
capital markets, deregulation, and increased inward FDI and the restructuring of Japanese 
corporations. 
 Restructuring capital markets

ated persistent instability in the corporate ﬁ nance system. During the 1980s and 1990s

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
there was a general move toward using capital markets (bonds and equity) for funding 
investment, particularly among large manufacturing companies in Japan. Partly as a con-
sequence, banking relationships became less stable with far more companies taking loans 
from more than one bank and changing their main lender. Loose ﬁ nancial discipline in the 
high-growth, high-investment years resulted in heavy depreciation charges, often on invest-
ments that resulted in overcapacity rather than bringing in extra revenue. 
 The scale of this instability only became clear after the bubble era when the collapse 
in property prices, which underpinned much of the private-sector borrowing, left many 
companies in financial difficulties. In the late 1990s foreign investors took advantage of 
the depressed prices to buy property in Japan. This triggered a move toward greater trans-
parency of data relating to property values, occupancy rates, and rents, and made it more 
difficult to use property to hide personal and corporate finances. Credit recovery, loans, 
and mortgage services, previously restricted to local firms, were also opened up to foreign 
participants, with tax laws changed to facilitate this. 
 That conditions were getting tougher for Japanese firms is evident from the data on 
debt liabilities and bankruptcies. This prompted widespread changes in corporate govern-
ance practices in Japan in the mid-2000s. 22  Average return on equity in 1997 was around 
4 percent in Japan compared to 20 percent in the United States, a contrast that preceded 
the recession but had been accepted as part of the financial system. But while US com-
panies achieve returns of around 4.5 percent on average above cost of capital, from 1990 
to the mid-2000s Japanese firms (on average) failed to meet the growing costs of capital 
(that is, they were “value destroyers” rather than “value creators”). 
 As a result of these problems, a process of consolidation, rationalization, and mergers got 
underway in Japanese capital markets, partly forced on banks from government organiza-
tions, as financial deregulation continued ( Figure   18.4   ). Disintermediation has taken place, 
 Figure 18.4  Bank group consolidation in Japan

CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
with companies raising finance from capital markets rather than via traditional  keiretsu 
cross-shareholding and bank relationships. 23  Private equity and venture capital also played 
a growing role, as did foreign investors. 
  Deregulation, increased M&A, and inward FDI 
 Although external pressure to deregulate the Japanese from European and US corpo-
rations and governments has declined, the pressure from inside Japan has grown. Structural 
reforms, changes to government policy and the legal codes, plus the changing priorities of 
Japanese ﬁ rms and customers have led to a signiﬁ cant increase in inward investment. In 
particular, foreign M&As, largely unheard of before the mid-1990s, have grown substan-
tially, and enjoyed another resurgence in recent years, as shown in  Figure   18.5   , but these 
are still relatively less signiﬁ cant than in other advanced economies. The number of foreign 
takeover bids each year in Japan exceeded 100 for the ﬁ rst time in 2007 and continued to 
grow until the end of the decade. 24 
 European firms have significantly increased their investments in Japan. French firms 
were early investors in the late 1990s, making large acquisitions in Japan’s automobile, auto 
parts, and finance/insurance industries. Renault’s 36.8 percent stake in Nissan in March 
1999 contributed to this (see   Real Case: Renault and Nissan: no pain, no gain   at the end of 
this chapter). Three sectors—finance, transport equipment, and telecommunications—
accounted for a significant proportion of M&As. But foreign firms have also made attempts 
to buy into other sectors, including retailing (see   International Business Strategy in Action: 
Wal-Mart takes Seiyu  ). Between 1996 and 2006 the total value of inward FDI stock had 
increased four-fold, but then stabilized and still remains relatively low compared to other 
OECD countries.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Wal-Mart takes Seiyu 
 The Japanese landscape is littered with the remains of 
foreign firms that misjudged the local market. In March 
2002, Wal-Mart purchased a 6 percent stake in Seiyu, the 
fourth-largest supermarket chain in Japan, which has 393 
stores selling food, clothing, and general merchandise. The 
2001 replacement of Japan’s Large-Scale Retail Store Law, 
which prevented large retail developments, with the more 
generous Large-Scale Retail Store Location Law has eased 
Wal-Mart’s entry. It retained an option to slowly increase its 
ownership position in the company to 66.7 percent by 2007. 
In 2003, after a five-month feasibility study on opportunities 
in the Japanese market, it took a step in that direction by 
agreeing to spend $420 million to raise its stake to 34 per-
cent, making Wal-Mart the dominant shareholder. Finally 
at the end of 2007 it bought out the remaining shares to 
become sole owner of Seiyu. (This became the subject of 
an unusual insider-dealing investigation in Japan in 2010.) 
 To its Japanese operations, Wal-Mart brought a new 
management style, strategy, supplier networks, and one 
of the world’s most formidable information and distribu-
tions systems. With $244 billion in revenues, Wal-Mart also 
brought the financial power to update Seiyu’s ailing 400 
stores. However, since 2003 Seiyu has continued to post 
annual losses. 
 Success in Japan’s retail market remains anything but 
assured. The Always Low Prices strategy on which Wal-
Mart based its North American success must be adapted 
significantly to cater to the Japanese market. Japanese 
consumers insist on standards of quality that Wal-Mart is 
simply not used to offering in other countries. When, in the 
early 1990s, the Japanese retail giant Ito-Yokado stocked 
Wal-Mart biscuits in its stores, they were literally shunned 
because of their sickly taste and poor quality. Some 40 per-
cent of the biscuits in each packet were said to be broken. 
Ito-Yokado had to discontinue the product. 
 Further complicating Wal-Mart’s strategy is the resil-
ience of Japan’s complex supply system. Carrefour, which 
entered Japan in 2002, is a good example. The French firm 
has fallen well short of its original plan to persuade all 
its Japanese suppliers to adopt the Carrefour direct-
purchasing system. This has reflected both a lack of famili-
arity on the part of Japanese suppliers with such a system 
as well as the vice-like control over suppliers exerted by 
large Japanese retailers. Wal-Mart’s terrifying reputation 
for squeezing suppliers’ margins until the pips squeak—
and then some more—may also make it less attractive as a 
partner for local firms. 
 Wal-Mart’s success in the United States has also been 
based on low land prices and labor costs. The price of land 
in the outskirts of North American cities and suburbs has 
allowed the company to build large warehouse-style retail 
stores with huge parking lots. Japanese land, however, 
is significantly more expensive. Despite a recession and 
the stagnation of the Japanese economy, Japanese labor 
costs are among the highest in the world. That customers 
demand personal service does not help either. For similar-
sized stores, Wal-Mart will have to hire more retail workers 
in a Japanese store than in the United States. 
 Lessons learned by Carrefour show that Wal-Mart will 
also have to differentiate itself from competitors. Carrefour 
positioned itself in the Japanese market simply as a dis-
count retailer. With little to distinguish its product mix from 
those of its local rivals, the firm’s stores underperformed, 
forcing a switch in strategy to emphasize its “Frenchness.” 
It now offers a limited range of French products. After its 
initial stumble, the company expanded in Japan. 
 The emphasis on fresh produce in Japanese cuisine 
means that there is high demand for perishable goods 
and less for the kind of processed foods that are often 
the staple of Western discount supermarkets. This was 
also cited as one reason behind the sluggish sales at the 
US warehouse retailer, Costco, since it entered Japan in 
1999. 
 Another cultural consideration is that the Japanese are 
hesitant to purchase bulk quantities even if it would save 
them money. The reason for this is rather simple. While the 
Japanese remain among the world’s wealthiest consumers 
with a GDP per head of US $32,000, they have on average 
only 350 ft 2  (33 m 2 ) of living space per capita—45 percent 
less than Americans and 14 percent less than either the 
British or Germans. 
 To date, Wal-Mart has been finding ways to tailor its 
strategy to the Japanese market. The quality of its products 
has been raised enough to be acceptable. In renovated 
Seiyu stores, customers can see their sushi order prepared 
in front of them, as opposed to the prepackaged variety 
offered in other countries. To lower land costs, Wal-Mart’s 
stores will have two floors instead of the traditional one 
floor. Labor costs have been reduced by cutting 25 per-
cent of its workforce through voluntary retirement, saving 
$46 million on annual wages. It is also relying on its China-
based suppliers to stock its Japanese shelves. 
 But other factors have added to the company’s prob-
lems, particularly from Japan’s continuing economic woes 
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION

CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
and the tough competitive environment. Uniquely in the 
developed world, consumer prices in Japan have been 
falling for some time. Growth has remained sluggish. Yet, 
that in itself might make this the right moment to enter the 
market. By the time the country starts to grow again, Wal-
Mart will have renovated stores, created new relationships 
with suppliers, linked all Seiyu stores to its computerized 
logistics system, and learned enough about the Japanese 
consumer. Its choice of a local partner in the venture 
should have given it the benefit of local knowledge and a 
large store base. This is an advantage over other foreign 
retailers like Carrefour and Costco, which have chosen 
to build up stores from scratch. But other domestic and 
foreign competitors are readying up and Seiyu continues to 
lose Wal-Mart money.

As part of the general growth of foreign direct investment into Japan, why 
are foreign firms increasingly able and willing to engage in mergers and 
acquisitions (M&As) with local firms? 
 Deregulation by the Japanese government has helped to make it easier in recent years for 
foreign firms to acquire Japanese firms. Changes in capital markets, some driven by the 
government, have promoted inflows of foreign capital to reduce the debt burden. Japanese 
banks are also much more interested in M&A as a means to rescue (or hand over responsi-
bility for) failing local companies. More significant factors are, first, the growing optimism 
among foreign firms regarding the future prospects of the Japanese market and their 
confidence in M&A as a means of access. Second, the rise in M&As can be partly attributed 
to the changing attitudes of senior Japanese managers who see foreign firms as a means 
to escape their current economic problems. M&As can help drive some of the strategic 
changes desired by Japanese managers, such as internationalization and diversification. 
They can also help push through some of the necessary organizational changes, from de-
linking from  keiretsu  relationships to changing internal hierarchies and reward systems.  
 The initial corporate reaction to the recession was to treat falling proﬁ ts as part of a cycli-
cal trend that companies could weather using their momentum from the previous dec-
ade. Japanese managers had little experience on how to handle the radical restructuring 
and downsizing that became necessary, particularly the problem of labor costs that quickly 
began to erode domestic manufacturing competitiveness. Labor costs per head in manu-
facturing were 25 percent higher in 1992 than in 1988, in part because of the rise in white-
collar employment, which expanded by a ﬁ fth between 1985 and 1992. Managers were 
particularly slow in reorganizing to overcome their own ofﬁ ce and administrative inef-
ﬁ ciencies and this, combined with their reticence in cutting employees, resulted in the rapid 
collapse of corporate earnings at the start of the downturn. 25 
 RESTRUCTURING CORPORATIONS 

592
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 The impact of the corporate restructuring was clear from the series of companies 
announcing job losses at the start of the 2000’s, including Toshiba, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, and 
Nissan. Most firms cut their university recruitment programs pushing the unemployment 
rate for under 24-year- olds to over 10 percent. Some of the largest bankruptcies hit the 
economy at the start of the decade, including the life insurer Chiyoda Mutual with debts 
of 2,900 billion yen and the retailer Sogo in with debts of 2,000 billion yen. 
 Despite rationalization, consolidation, and a significant growth of M&As in key sectors, 
Japanese companies are still having to restructure their operations substantially in the face 
of longer-term pressures, including: 
 ■  more expensive capital, 
 ■  growing competition from low-cost Asian producers, 
 ■  declining prices of key manufactures, particularly electronics and autos, 
 ■  a slowing domestic economy, and 
 ■  growing inroads into the domestic economy by foreign competitors. 
 These developments had a knock-on effect as Japanese firms responded by restructur-
ing internally and changing their interfirm trading relationships. The main changes are 
summarized below. 
  The decline of manufacturing and distribution  keiretsu 
 Because a large proportion of Japanese SMEs are subcontractors to larger companies, 
within the multi-tiered hierarchies, recession and reorganization among the giants have 
had a direct effect on a large number of SMEs. Restructuring effects, coupled with the 
appreciation of the yen, have passed on down this hierarchy, from primary (direct) sub-
contractors through second-, third-, and fourth-level indirect suppliers. Automotive ﬁ rms, 
including Mazda and Nissan, attempted to cut their ﬁ rst-line subcontractors (from 62 to 
16 in Mazda’s case), thereby passing on the responsibility for pushing down input prices to 
companies further down the chain. Both met with greater success in this slimming down 
initiative after their respective mergers with Ford and Renault (see   Real Case: Renault and 
Nissan: no pain, no gain at the end of this chapter). 
 The system of cross-shareholding has become increasingly diluted through reductions 
in mutual equity stakes. In their drive to cut costs large manufacturing firms in Japan now 
avoid giving their usual suppliers a guaranteed volume of business over the long term but 
are encouraging them to compete with each other with a new emphasis on price as the 
deciding factor. More inputs are now bought from abroad so a more price-driven domestic 
market and freer flows of imports have evolved. 
 There has also been a decline in the use of exclusive agreements with single distributors 
or sales organizations. In the past these were the norm and in most sectors it was im-
possible to have multiple agreements or play distributors and retailers against each other 
to push up sales. Increasingly now, multiple agreements are accepted and the trader–
wholesaler–retailer link need not be tied but competitive, with many players competing at 
each level in a “less imperfect” market.  
  The growth of outward FDI and offshore manufacturing 
 Nearly half of all cars and machines made by Japanese-owned companies are made out-
side Japan. It has been overtaken by China as the largest producer of automobiles and 
color televisions (Japan is now a net importer). A telling example of the resultant pressures 
was Nissan’s closure of its 30-year-old Zama car plant near Tokyo in March 1995, the ﬁ rst 

593
CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
Japanese car plant to be closed since World War II. Ironically, part of the plant that made 
11.2 million vehicles in its lifetime was turned into a pre-delivery inspection center for 
Ford vehicles. From 2010-2011 Japan became the leading foreign investor in China, with 
a particular boost after the March 2011 earthquake. Japanese automotive and machinery 
ﬁ rms increased their investments into China and exports from China to Japan increased as 
a result. 
  The decline of lifetime employment and changing HRM practices 
 Many of the changes being forced on Japanese managers are culturally taboo but econ-
omically inevitable. One of the most signiﬁ cant is the erosion of the lifetime employment 
system, which is very unlikely ever to return in its traditional form. Unemployment, tradi-
tionally very low and carrying a huge social stigma, ofﬁ cially grew to over 5 percent (unof-
ﬁ cial estimates put the peak nearer 8 percent). 
 Early retirements, horizontal movement of employees, rising use of performance-
related pay, and significantly reduced wage increases and bonuses at the annual wage nego-
tiations in Japan also signified the new pressures on companies. The largest companies 
reduced their usual intake of university graduates and introduced merit-based remuner-
ation schemes. These changes also had significant knock-on effects, not least the rise in the 
already high rate of suicides. In the long term, Japan will have an increasingly flexible labor 
market, with implications for all aspects of the traditional employee–employer relation-
ship, in-house training, and company loyalty. 26 
 Diversification strategies 
 Diversiﬁ cation strategies have been the cornerstone of many corporate restructuring plans, 
some successful, others not. 27  NKK, Japan’s second-largest steelmaker, is a good example. Its 
previously loss-making marine engineering division turned in an operating proﬁ t of almost 
15 percent on sales of almost $100 million (although NKK overall expects to make a loss 
of ﬁ ve times this amount). The turnaround in this particular division was due to extensive 
(and risky) investments into areas outside shipbuilding. These include the leisure industry, 
manufacturing an indoor ski slope and an artiﬁ cial surﬁ ng beach (Wild Blue), using core 
technologies from NKK’s own test divisions. In addition to diversiﬁ cation within manufac-
turing, the changing cost structure for industrial production has, in particular, accelerated 
the shift toward services.

Despite widespread changes in Japan and the restructuring of Japanese 
corporations, why is it still important for foreign managers to understand 
something of the history and the context in which Japanese businesses have 
evolved? 
 Whether competing with Japanese businesses, collaborating with them, or working for 
them, their current practices and their distinctive strengths and weaknesses are the 
result of their historical development in the political, economic, and social context of 
Japan. Their past is also the clue to their current restructuring, why it is necessary, and

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Several studies, including one by Michael Porter and colleagues, have examined the 
ongoing changes in Japan and analyzed the challenges facing Japanese managers, to suggest 
the following guidelines for transforming the Japanese company: 28 
 ■  Create distinctive, long-term strategies . Rather than imitating close rivals, break out of the 
consensus and do something different. 
 ■  Expand the focus of operational effectiveness . That is, improve office-level productivity as 
well as plant-level efficiency. 
 ■  Learn the role of industry strategy in structure . Among a number of strategic changes, 
firms should avoid getting locked into price-based rivalry.  
 ■  Shift the goal from growth to profitability . Focusing on market share was only possible 
with “patient capital” (linked to  keiretsu  and traditional capital markets); shareholder 
pressure will push for performance-related rewards.  
 ■  Reverse unrelated diversification.  Pare down to your core competencies and let other 
firms do the rest.  
 ■  Update the Japanese organizational model . Change internal practices away from hier-
archy and consensus toward meritocracy and entrepreneurship.  
 ■  Move away from incremental change . Become more flexible and responsive to suit the 
new competitive environment. 
 The few successful international Japanese firms, including Sony and Toyota, are seen as 
future models by many because they have adapted successfully to the new realities. In fact, 
it could be argued that their relatively high level of internationalization prior to the domes-
tic market recession gave them the necessary portfolio of overseas markets and sources of 
inputs, the global scale and scope advantages needed to weather the local storms. Other 
firms have failed to adapt, often locked into cultural and institutional routines which were 
born out of the golden era of economic growth but which are ill-suited to the new realities. 29 
Old habits die hard.   
market need to know about the broader context of Japan because this provides insights 
into the role of government agencies, the business infrastructure,  keiretsu networks, 
business etiquette, the culturally influenced preferences of customers, and the many 
other differences and difficulties that require adaptation. Japanese firms are a product of 
this unique environment and relatively few have broken away from their dependence on 
Japan’s domestic market, and most retain elements of traditional Japanese management 
practices. Foreign managers will better understand the strategic options and organiz-
ational challenges they face in alliances, joint ventures, and M&As with Japanese com-
panies if they know something of their home environment.   
 Japan continues in a period of fundamental political, economic, and social transfor-
mation. Corporations have been forced by a drawn-out economic recession to alter radically 
the way they organize and invest. Foreign ﬁ rms are ﬁ nding, despite the depressed state of 
the Japanese market, that there are unprecedented opportunities for alliances and take-
overs involving Japanese ﬁ rms and for introducing new products and services to Japanese 
customers. There is a new period of internationalization as Japanese ﬁ rms shift invest-
ments out of Japan and attempt to reduce their dependence on local markets, while foreign

CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
imports, investment, and M&As are on the increase. Partly because of the signiﬁ cance of the 
new trading partner and rising power, China, this amounts to processes of regionalization 
rather than globalization. 
 Much of this chapter has looked at the traditional way of doing business in Japan, the 
unique capital markets,  keiretsu , demanding customers, lifetime employment, and the tra-
ditional strengths and weaknesses of Japanese firms. The point of this is that these are endur-
ing facets of Japanese business and they underlie the key distinctiveness that collaborators and 
competitors need to understand. They also continue to strongly influence the restructuring 
options open to Japanese firms and the changes in the economy as a whole. 
 James C. Abegglen, one of the most experienced Western commentators on Japan, sums 
up this tension between old and new in his book  21st Century Japanese Management: New 
Systems, Lasting Values . 30  He describes how success comes from effectively combining the 
best of old and new. To do this requires some understanding of how adaptability can be 
promoted in the face of inertia. But it also demonstrates how any in-depth country analysis 
must take account of the way that distinctive local economic, political, social, and cultural 
characteristics have evolved in the past and will continue to influence  relative business 
practices, markets, and competitiveness in the future. 
 1  The current strengths and weaknesses of Japanese firms result from their evolution in 
a highly competitive but continually growing domestic economy with unique socio-
cultural foundations.  
 2   The Japanese business environment was traditionally characterized by strong interfirm 
rivalry; “patient” long-term finance, partly through cross-shareholding arrangements; 
 keiretsu  relationships, both vertical and horizontal; complex, multi-tiered distribution 
systems; demanding customers; and strong government intervention in the early years.  
 3  Socio-cultural factors that supported the Japanese way of doing business include 
ideals of obligation, loyalty, hierarchy and ritual, and a strong work ethic, linked to 
mainstream religion; a strong but conformist education system and “groupism” plus 
consensus-based decision making in general; and complex language and tacit forms of 
communication. 
 4   Japanese firms are traditionally loyal to employees, who tend not to move from com-
pany to company; hierarchical and bureaucratic but also consensus oriented; good at 
integrating between functions and teamwork; good at applied R&D and training; long-
termist; and close to suppliers and customers.  
 5   The Japanese market has traditionally been difficult for foreign investors to break into, 
partly because of the factors listed above and partly because of the system of governance 
that tends to favor local firms.  
 6   Japan is changing. Growing social and political heterogeneity alongside a prolonged 
economic recession is creating unprecedented tensions and forcing drastic corporate 
restructuring.  Keiretsu  families are loosening or breaking up; firms are diversifying and 
divesting; lifetime employment is declining; capital markets are heavily restructuring; 
and deregulation is the norm.  
 7   Changes in Japan are creating investment, M&A, and market-entry opportunities for 
foreign firms.  
 8   The growing regional Asian economy is centered on the major trading partnership 
between Japan and China.

 Renault and Nissan: no pain, no gain 
 In March 1999 one of Europe’s biggest car makers, Renault, 
bought a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan, Japan’s second-
largest vehicle manufacturer. It has since increased its 
stake to 44.4 percent with Nissan taking a reciprocal 
15 percent share in Renault. The alliance has deepened 
following the far-reaching changes put in place by Carlos 
Ghosn, installed as President and CEO of Nissan and now 
revered for having engineered a radical turnaround in the 
firm’s fortunes. Although numerous alliances involving 
equity participation had taken place before this, notably the 
 REAL CASE 

597
CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
Ford–Mazda alliance, the Renault–Nissan case was seen to 
be a highly unusual foreign “rescue” of a major Japanese 
firm in dire straits. 
 Nissan had made losses in six of the seven years prior 
to 1999, having been hit hardest of all the major car manu-
facturers in Japan by the decline in domestic sales and 
the rise in local manufacturing costs. Factory capacity 
utilization had fallen to 53 percent, and Carlos Ghosn, the 
new CEO of Nissan (known as “le cost-killer”), set out to 
cut 21,000 jobs, close five factories, and cut the number 
of suppliers in half. Close,  keiretsu  relationships with sup-
pliers and distributors were traditionally seen to be a key 
strength of Japanese manufacturers (Nissan had formerly 
been part of the Fuyo  keiretsu ), supporting high-quality 
products, process innovation, just-in-time supply systems, 
and rapid, customer-led new product development. In a 
time of recession they represented an overextended sup-
plier and dealer base, undermining profitability. 
 Internal restructuring also took place, following Ghosn’s 
plan to introduce stock options and bonuses based on 
achievement and a performance-based promotions 
scheme, eventually for both employees and managers. 
 In the case of both external and internal reorganization 
there are significant clashes with the traditional Japanese 
way of doing things. First and foremost, job losses repre-
sent an enormous problem for managers and employees 
alike, almost a personal admission of failure on both sides 
which has social as well as corporate repercussions. 
The ties of obligation and loyalty associated with lifetime 
employment are broken. Indirectly, the breakdown of 
 keiretsu  links with other firms has a parallel effect, also 
resulting in job losses and the separation of long-term 
associations, which include personal friendships between 
managers and employees in both sets of firms. 
 Internal changes, particularly the introduction of per-
formance-based remuneration and reward, are also radi-
cal in the eyes of the Japanese. Lifetime employment is 
associated with an age-related hierarchy where salaries 
only grow toward the end of a manager’s tenure in the firm, 
as a reward for long years of service. To lose this reward, 
either because the firm no longer needs you or because the 
basis of remuneration is changed, is a drastic shift in the 
social contract employees entered into. Moreover, losing 
out to fast-track younger managers who rise up the hierar-
chy on the basis of their ability is not expected, particularly 
as talented managers may themselves have had to wait 
their turn in the past. 
 The steps taken by Renault change the rules of the game 
in Japan. Many would say that a sharp shock to push much 
needed restructuring was the only way. Renault’s rescue 
was called for partly because of Nissan’s accumulated 
losses, which could no longer be supported in a recession, 
particularly by investors who could no longer afford to ride 
the storm in a time when capital markets were tighten-
ing significantly. But it was also needed because of the 
inherent problems Japanese managers face in trying to 
drive such radical restructuring themselves. The senior 
managers responsible for six years of losses are still 
in charge alongside Ghosn, having “saved face” because 
an outsider (a  gaijin ) forced the radical steps needed to 
turn the company around. Without this outside shock many 
Japanese firms remain locked in to a certain way of doing 
things because forcing these kinds of changes from the 
inside on one’s work colleagues and friends appears to 
be too costly. It threatens to destroy the social as well as 
the business fabric on which the country’s impressive his-
toric growth has been founded, and most Japanese do not 
want to be responsible for this kind of destruction, however 
creative it might be. 
 The Renault–Nissan alliance is now heralded as one of 
the most successful in the business. In the first few years 
Nissan’s $13 billion debt was substantially reduced and 
it achieved $2.3 billion profits in 2002. The market capi-
talization of Renault increased three-fold and for Nissan 
more than four-fold. The combined companies were the 
third-largest global auto maker in terms of unit sales with 
a market share of 9 percent since 2009.

CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
 On reflection, it represents the combination of two very 
different organizations, structurally and culturally. Renault 
was a strongly home-region-oriented firm, heavily depend-
ent on its home economy, France. Alone it was relatively 
small, holding just 4.2 percent of the global market, but 
vying with Volkswagen for European market leadership. 
Nissan was one of the unusual bi-regional auto firms, with 
strong sales in the United States and a relatively good 
market position in countries outside the triad regions. The 
bar chart in  Figure  18.6 , together with  Figure  18.7 , shows 
the individual and combined sales of both firms. These 
are similar-sized firms with very different geographic 
footprints that complement each other well. Indeed, for 
the year ended March 31, 2011, Nissan revenue grew 27 
percent compared to 2010 and it achieved a record high of 
US$102,380 mil lion in the past five years. Renault SA’s 
revenue was US$51,611 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2010. In contrast to Nissan, Renault SA’s rev-
enues have been flat and even declined in the past five years. 
 A similar pattern of differentiation is true for production. 
Nissan manufactures just over half of its vehicles in Japan 
with most of the rest spread fairly evenly among the United 
States, Mexico, and the UK. It has industrial operations 
in 19 countries, including manufacturing sites in Taiwan, 
South Africa, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. 
Renault manufactures in 17 countries but makes over 
55 percent of its vehicles in France and most of the rest in 
Europe (see  Figure  18.7 ). 
 Driven by an alliance board, chaired by the CEO of 
Renault, the two firms have developed shared production 
facilities in Mexico, Brazil, and Spain; common engineering 
platforms for entry-level B segment and mid-level C seg-
ment vehicles; common powertrain parts and increased 
sharing of engines and transmissions; and increasingly 
integrated IT, information, and communications systems. 
 Renault’s competencies in marketing, design, and 
financing complement Nissan’s capabilities in engineering 
and manufacturing processes. Synergies are enhanced 
through the exchange of personnel. About 50 employees 
from Renault originally joined departments such as sup-
plier relations, product strategy, sales and marketing, and 
finance in Nissan. Similarly, around 50 Nissan employees 
began work in the areas of quality control, vehicle engin-
eering, manufacturing, and powertrain in Renault. Beyond 
this, 250 executives from both firms were assigned to the 
permanent alliance structures, including cross-company 
teams and functional task teams, and a further 250 Nissan 
employees were part of the restructured European sales 
and marketing divisions of Renault.

 1 What broad economic and specific corporate 
pressures have resulted in the need for a radical 
shake-up of Nissan?   
 2 In the context of traditional Japanese employment 
and working practices and interfirm relationships, 
why are the changes being pushed by Renault’s 
Ghosn considered radical? 
 3 What has accounted for Ghosn’s success to date 
with the Nissan restructuring?   
 4 In what ways are the two companies better together?     
 Canon Group 
 Few companies can claim to be truly global multinationals, 
but with sales, revenues, production, and employees dis-
tributed across the world, the Canon Group of Japan comes 
as close as any to fitting that title. In 2010, Canon’s sales 
grew 23 percent compared to the previous year 2009 to 
a record high of US $42.225 billion in the past five years. 
77 percent of its sales were generated outside of Japan. 
The Americas accounted for 27 percent and Europe for 
31 percent, with the remainder elsewhere, including other 
Asia–Pacific markets. 
 Canon operates in three business segments. The Office 
segment provides office network, color network and per-
sonal multifunction devices, office, color and personal copy 
machines, laser printers, large-sized ink-jet printers and 
 REAL CASE 
▼

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
digital production printers, among others. The Consumer 
segment provides digital single-lens reflex cameras, com-
pact digital cameras, interchangeable lens, digital video 
cameras, ink-jet multifunction devices, single-function 
ink-jet printers, image scanners, television lens for broad-
casting use, among others. The Industrial Equipment and 
Others segment provides exposure equipment used in 
semiconductor and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), medi-
cal image recording equipment, ophthalmic instruments, 
magnetic heads, micro motors, computers, handy terminals, 
document scanners and calculators, among others. Canon 
is dual listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange and New York Stock 
Exchange. 
 The company had its beginnings in 1933, when Precision 
Optical Instruments Laboratory was established to conduct 
research into cameras in Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo. In 
1947 the company changed its name to Canon Camera 
Co., and only in 1969 did the company take on the name 
Canon Inc. In 2010, the company had revenues totalling 
US $42.225 billion, up from $29 billion in 2003, and 196,074 
employees, up from 103,000 in 2003. In contrast to its dis-
tribution of sales, 43 percent of its employees are based 
in Japan and just 7 percent in Europe, 7 percent in North 
America, and 43 percent elsewhere, predominantly in 
South-East Asian production centers. 
 Canon’s international expansion started in 1955 with the 
opening of a New York branch. Initially, the company relied 
on sole distributors and established some in Europe and 
Latin America in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The sole 
distributor system was abolished in 1963 to make way for 
company-owned subsidiaries under the direct control of 
the Japanese headquarters. 
 International expansion goes beyond marketing to 
include production, research, and development. Taiwan 
became the site of Canon’s first foreign production facility 
in 1970. Two years later the company opened a manufac-
turing plant in Germany. By 2001, the company had produc-
tion facilities in all parts of the triad—Western Europe, the 
Asia–Pacific region, and North America. Nevertheless, the 
vast majority of Canon’s production facilities remain in 
Asia, including Japan. 
 In 1990, R&D centers were opened in the United States, 
Australia, France, Thailand, and the People’s Republic of 
China. Each R&D facility specializes in a specific product 
line and is coordinated by a centralized R&D lab in Japan. 
Together with its R&D strategy, this has made Canon one 
of the best world innovators and the largest holder of 
patents after IBM and Samsung. 
 Canon is organized regionally. Canon USA oversees 
operations in the Americas. The subsidiary has its own 
marketing, R&D, and production facilities. Two companies 
oversee European operations. Together, they have two 
manufacturing plants in Germany and France, and R&D 
centers in the UK and France. Canon’s operations in Asia 
and Oceania, excluding Japan, account for the largest 
number of employees in foreign countries. Regionwide 
activities for the Asian market are overseen by the Canon 
Asia Marketing Group, but marketing operations in this 
region are fragmented into subregional or national mar-
kets. The South-East Asia region is the responsibility of 
Canon Singapore. Hong Kong has its own subsidiary that is 
also responsible for Taiwan and part of South Korea. The 
mainland Chinese market is the responsibility of Canon 
(China) Co. Japan’s home market is still very important. 
Nearly half of Canon’s employees are still working in Japan 
and companywide R&D is still centralized there. Canon 
Australia is responsible for operations in the Oceania 
region. 
 The firm spends 8 percent of its revenue on R&D. Canon 
finds not only new technologies, but also new methods of 
manufacturing products. Canon has been reorganizing its 
production facilities to take advantage of its global scope, 
selecting suppliers and production facilities across the 
world to minimize costs and decrease production time. 
As a result product design data can now be sent to plants 
around the world via computer. Information is translated 
through an automatic translation system allowing faster 
communication between subsidiaries. The firm is now 
using simulation technology to minimize the costly process 
of prototype production. 
 At a time when other Japanese and many other, large 
electronic companies are struggling to remain competi-
tive, Canon’s profits are soaring. The firm has been able 
to remain competitive by selecting those business lines in 
which it can be successful given its strength in R&D and 
production technology. The firm abandoned the markets 
for personal computers, typewriters, and liquid crystal 
displays to concentrate on cameras, printers, and copiers. 
 Studies suggest that one of Canon’s key competencies is 
its global system for new product development. In particu-
lar it has evolved a number of organizational mechanisms 
for linking R&D and customer requirements globally. This 
is partly done through alliances and joint ventures in which 
Canon invests over the long term to derive the benefits of 
co-learning and joint resource development. Canon con-
tributes its technological capabilities and supplier links 
and local partners bring expertise relating to local cus-
tomer preferences, distribution, and marketing. 
 On the plant floor, Canon’s high productivity increases 
have been based on cell production technology. Here, a 
small number of workers have responsibility for the final 
assembly of the product. This type of production not only 
increases the amount of a product being produced per 
labor-hour, but also ensures quality as it is easier to back-
track the production process of a single product. It also 
saves floor space. Since 1998, Canon has decreased the 

601
CHAPTER 18 JAPAN
length of its conveyor lines by 12 miles (19 km). However, 
the productivity increases of applying and perfecting cell 
technology to its operations are reaching a limit and now 
Canon is seeking ways of integrating automation technol-
ogy into its production process. 
 In 2002, Canon made the unlikely decision to establish a 
facility in Oita, Kyushu, Japan, to produce digital cameras. 
CEO Fujio Mitari’s explanation is that “If we switch fac-
tories each time a place with lower labor costs is found, 
all investment in equipment is wasted. Instead, we should 
use our strengths in production, and manufacture products 
more cheaply than they could be manufactured in locations 
where the cost of labor is lower.” Indeed, nearly 60 percent 
of Canon products are still manufactured in Japan. The 
company’s long-term plan is to reach a balance between 
outsourcing and Japanese production. Mitari’s position is 
that anything for which labor costs are more than 5 percent 
of production costs can be outsourced to low labor-cost 
areas, such as China, and anything for which labor costs 
are less than 5 percent of production—typically the more 
advanced technologically—can be produced domestically.

By examining the broader competitive environment 
within which firms evolve we can identify where specific 
differences and competitive strengths and weaknesses 
come from. Evolutionary theories of the firm (Peyton 
Young), contingency theory (Donaldson), and the theory 
of nationally bound administrative heritages (Calori et al.) 
all follow variations of this approach. L. Donaldson,  The

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Within NAFTA, the United States, Canada, and Mexico constitute 
a thriving economic bloc. More than 32 percent of all US trade is 
with Canada and Mexico; both those countries conduct well over 
75 percent of their international trade with the United States (see 
 Tables  19.1 ,  19.2 , and  19.3 below). Since market access to the United 
States is fairly open and already well documented, this chapter will 
focus on the other two members of NAFTA: Canada and Mexico. 
These countries are very different from the United States and have 
distinctive business practices. Doing business in these countries 
requires just as much research and attention to institutional detail as 
doing business in the EU or Japan. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  the nature of the Canadian and Mexican political and 
economic systems and their implications for business strategy.  
 2  Review  the business environment with primary attention on the 
industrial, regulatory, banking and finance, and labor relations 
areas. 
 3  Investigate  major economic opportunities that exist in Canada and 
Mexico and some of the ways of conducting business in these 
nations. 
 4  Consider  specific institutional arrangements, namely, the United 
States–Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which play an important 
role in shaping opportunities and the business environment in 
North America.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came 
into effect on January 1, 1994. Over the years, it has been 
the subject of debate and frequent misunderstanding. 
For example, in the 2008 campaign for the democratic 
presidential candidate both Senator Hillary Clinton and 
Senator Barack Obama pledged to renegotiate NAFTA to 
add environmental policies and to help labor adjustment. 
Yet, NAFTA was the first international trade agreement to 
incorporate both of these issues. NAFTA set up an environ-
mental commission to monitor the impact of environmental 
regulations on trade and investment. NAFTA also incorpo-
rated labor adjustment programs in the form of assistance 
for retraining and upgrading of individual worker skills. 
 What then is the actual nature of NAFTA and what has 
been its impact? While NAFTA is a complex international 
agreement, it only has two basic principles. First, all tariffs 
on trade in manufactured goods are abolished. Second, the 
principle of national treatment is applied to foreign direct 
investment. Together these two basic principles serve to 
help open the internal markets of all three countries to 
greater amounts of trade and investment. In other words, 
regional economic integration is fostered. Indeed, recent 
data indicate that Canada and Mexico account for about 
one-third of all US trade (these countries are the largest 
trading partners for the United States ahead of China, 
Japan, and the EU, see  Table   19.1   ). Both Canada and 
Mexico have over three-quarters of their trade with the 
United States (see  Tables  19.2 and  19.3 ). 
 NAFTA, however, is not a pure free trade agreement 
since many sectors are exempted from its provisions. For 
example, although tariffs have been abolished, the US textile 
and apparel sector is protected through a system of rules 
of origin. The latter serve to exclude garments assembled 
in Mexico from using textile fibers produced in Asia. In a 
similar manner automobiles cannot be assembled in Mexico 
and sold in the United States and Canada unless they have 
most of their components produced in North America. 
Similarly much of the US agriculture sector is still protected 
from Mexican competition. In the service sector (which now 
accounts for about 80 percent of all jobs in the United States 
and Canada) well over half the sectors were exempted from 
the principle of national treatment. For example, excluded 
sectors include all aspects of: health care; education; public 
administration; transportation; public utilities. This means 
that each country can enact discriminatory regulations to 
foster its indigenous firms and exclude foreign nationals 
from working in these exempted sectors.  
 In terms of environmental regulations, NAFTA is limited 
(under multilateral trade rules from the WTO) in its ability 
to enforce US and Canadian environmental standards upon 
Mexico. However, NAFTA aims to harmonize environmental 
standards over time by requiring that Mexico set minimum 
environmental standards and improve its enforcement to 
match those of its neighbors within NAFTA. This process is 
monitored by a trilateral environmental commission head-
quartered in Montreal, Canada. Research on the environ-
mental aspects of NAFTA by Rugman et al. (1999) showed 
that as US and Canadian automobile suppliers and specialty 
chemical firms relocated to Mexico under NAFTA, these 
firms built new plants which incorporated the high environ-
mental standards (ISO 1400) engineered into their produc-
tion processes. Thus, environmental standards in Mexico 
are being improved specifically due to NAFTA. Furthermore, 
each country retains sovereignty over its environmental laws, 
although compensation can be sought by a foreign investor 
if a change in such laws results in unfair economic loss, as 
assessed by the trilateral environmental commission. 
 As a result of NAFTA, in the last 15 years there has been 
a large increase in trade and investment across North 
America. The region has become even more integrated. 
Intra-regional exports in NAFTA now stand at 56 percent, 
up from 33 percent in 1980, see Rugman (2005). Why has 
NAFTA been so successful? 
 From the viewpoint of the United States it gains more 
secure access to the natural resources of Canada and Mexico. 
In particular, Canada has agreed to continue supplies of oil 
and gas exports to the United States even in times of economic 
disruption (in legal terms, existing contractual arrangements 
will be guaranteed). While Mexico did not incorporate such

energy provisions into its NAFTA agreement, it is clear that 
the United States now has more secure energy supplies 
from Mexico than it does from the Persian Gulf. Currently the 
United States has an option to achieve energy independence 
within North America if it chooses to increase investments in 
the Alberta Tar Sands and move away from oil imports from 
the Persian Gulf. Already the United States imports more oil 
from Canada and Mexico (27 percent) than it does from the 
Persian Gulf (24 percent), see Rugman (2007). 
 The big gain for Canada and Mexico from NAFTA is bet-
ter and more secure long-run access to the US market. 
What are the implications of this for Canadian and Mexican 
business? In Canada, a new set of Canadian businesses 
has emerged. These are successful competitors in the US 
market. These firms include: Bombardier, BCE, Magna 
(a major automobile supplier), RIM, Onex, and a set of 
large financial institutions including the Canadian banks. 
In Mexico companies such as Cemex and Carso Global 
Telecom have become major players in the United States. 
Perhaps more important is that clusters of world-class 
businesses have developed in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, 
and Vancouver in Canada and in Monterrey in Mexico. In 
short, the business sectors in both Canada and Mexico are 
being upgraded and modernized, such that these countries 
are creating new jobs for skilled and educated workers 
across the integrated geographic space of North America.

 In  Chapter 10  we saw that governments and the various institutions through which they 
wield their powers are important external factors in the international business environ-
ment. This chapter focuses on institutional factors in the North American market that must 
be considered when looking at the Canadian and Mexican markets. NAFTA has not abol-
ished all trade barriers between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. There are still major 
impediments to trade and investment. Furthermore, each of the partners retains its own 
trade laws. A legal mechanism to appeal trade decisions exists, but this is a compromise 
position. In contrast, EU member states cannot use trade laws against their partners. So 
although NAFTA is a step toward trade liberalization, business decisions should not assume 
that “free trade” makes Canada and Mexico identical to the United States.  
 INTRODUCTION 
 With a land area of almost 3.6 million square miles (9.3 million km 2 ), Canada is second 
in size only to Russia. Divided into 10 provinces and three territories (see accompany-
ing map), Canada is so large that it encompasses four time zones. The French and British 
fought over the country, with control passing into British hands in 1763. Canada became 
 CANADA 

609
CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
a separate nation in 1867, although it did not fully repatriate its Constitution until 1982. 
Today it remains a leading member of the British Commonwealth. 
 Canada’s economy 
 Canada’s 33 million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world. 
Consumer tastes and disposable wealth are very similar to those in the United States. Gross 
domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was about $1.564 trillion (2010 est.) and at current 
exchange rates. Over the last 16 years, the rate of economic growth has been in the 2 to 
4 percent range. Canada has typically had a positive balance of payments, thanks to its food, 
energy, and motor vehicle exports. Its primary trading partner is the United States, which 
provided over 52 percent of Canada’s imports and accounted for 78 percent of the country’s 
exports in 2008 (see  Table  19.2 ). 
 Canada’s economic growth historically has been based on the export of agricultural 
staples, especially grains, and on the production and export of natural resource products 
such as minerals, oil, gas, and forest products. However, major secondary industries have 
also emerged; Canada now ranks as one of the top 10 manufacturing nations in the world. 
The service industry is also expanding rapidly, especially financial services in Toronto. 
However, the country still faces a major productivity challenge. For each hour Canadians 
work, they produce 5.8 percent less than their US neighbors. 1 

610
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Almost 80 percent of manufacturing activity is located in Ontario and Quebec—including 
the entire motor vehicle industry, which is Canada’s largest segment—while Calgary has 
become a major high-tech center. 2  Almost one-quarter of all Canada’s exports (and imports) 
are in autos and auto-related products. The Canada–United States Automotive Products 
Trade Agreement (Autopact) has encouraged this two-way trade over the last 35 years, 
allowing free trade in autos assembled in either country, provided there was 50 percent value 
added in Canada. (Under NAFTA, the content provision rose to 62.5 percent.) Financial 
institutions and other business service industries are also concentrated in central Canada. 
The eastern and western areas of the country are more dependent on primary industries: 
fishing, forestry, and mining in the east; agriculture, ore, and mineral fuels in the west. The 
country’s growth was helped by large inflows of FDI; today, 40 percent of the primary and 
secondary industries are foreign owned. Yet Canada is wealthy enough now, and its economy 
is sufficiently mature, to have substantial outward FDI, particularly in the United States. 
 The United States has more FDI in Canada than in any other country, including the UK. 
Since 1988 this investment has doubled, and in 2009 it stood at about $260 billion. At the 
same time Canada has invested $250 billion in the United States, more than in any other 
country. 3  We can see these relationships within individual industries. For example, many 
US airlines, including American, Delta, and Northwest, fly to Canada, and Air Canada and 
Canadian Airlines, which was merged in 2001, among others, have US routes. So part of the 
US international airline strategy involves competing with Canadian carriers that are vying 
for the US market (see the case  International Business Strategy in Action: Bombardier ). 
There are many other examples of Canadian investment in the United States. Canadian 
Pacific has purchased the Delaware & Hudson Railway, and Bombardier Inc. bought the 
Learjet Corporation of Wichita, Kansas. Many other acquisitions are even larger.

 How has NAFTA affected Canada? 
 NAFTA eliminates tariffs and makes it easier for efficient Canadian firms to operate com-
petitively in the United States. At the same time, it allows efficient US firms to ship their 
goods into Canada without paying any tariffs and, in the process, helps drive down prices. 
So NAFTA helps the Canadian economy by encouraging efficiency, lowering prices, and 
opening up new markets in the United States.   
  Differences in the business environment 
 Despite many similarities between the business environments of the United States and 
Canada, there are also some important differences. 
 Canada’s industrial climate 
 The Canadian economy is characterized by private enterprise. However, some industries, such 
as broadcasting and public utilities, are government owned or subject to substantial govern-
ment regulation. 4 Over the past decade the trend has been toward privatization and deregu-
lation. In fact, a federal government minister oversees privatization and has been responsible for 
selling companies that the government feels are no longer essential to meet public policy goals. 
Firms that have been privatized include Canadair, the deHavilland Aircraft Company, Canadian 
National Railway’s trucking division, Fisheries Products International, and Air Canada.

CHAPTER 19  NORTH AMERICA
International Business Strategy in Action
Bombardier
In 1942 the dreams of a budding young Quebec entrepre-
neur came true with the incorporation of ­L’Auto-Neige 
Bombardier, the world’s first snowmobile ­manufacturer. 
Although mechanic-turned-industrialist Joseph Armand 
Bombardier had great plans for his innovative ­transportation 
inventions, he could never have foreseen the course his 
company would take in the next 50 years.
Today, Bombardier is one of the world’s top manufac-
turers of transportation products, with yearly ­revenues 
of $9.366 billion and 58,350 employees for the year 
ended January 31, 2010. Having begun with snowmobile 
­production, Bombardier is now among the world leaders 
in commuter and general transportation trains, as well as 
transport vehicles for industrial and military use, sailboats, 
motorcycles, and, more recently, smaller aircraft. This 
extension into numerous other industries has transformed 
Bombardier from a once small-town Quebec company into 
a global market competitor and leader with over 90 percent 
of its total business now conducted outside Canada. 
The company operates in two segments: aerospace 
(through Bombardier Aircraft) and rail transportation 
(through Bombardier Transportation). BA is engaged in the 
design and manufacture of aviation products and a pro-
vider of related services. BT is engaged in the design and 
manufacture of rail equipment and system and a provider 
of related services. It also provides bogies, electric propul-
sion, control equipment and maintenance services, as well 
as complete rail transportation systems and rail control 
solutions. BA’s aircraft portfolio includes a line of busi-
ness aircraft, commercial aircraft, including regional jets, 
turboprops and single-aisle mainline jets and amphibious 
aircraft.
Bombardier’s success is due mostly to the industrious and 
business instincts of their former company CEO and current 
chairman of the board Laurent Beaudoin, who in the past 30 
years has followed a strategy of market entry and product 
improvement through acquisition, instead of relying strictly 
on R&D. As a result, the company has managed to produce 
the most technically advanced, innovative, and reliable prod-
ucts on the market and gained substantial market share in 
many industries, especially with its rubber-wheeled subway 
car, sold to New York City in the 1980s.
This strategy has been exemplified by Bombardier’s 
entry into the aerospace industry with the acquisition of 
Canadair in 1986, 12 years after diversifying into the trans-
portation equipment business. The Canadair purchase 
brought the company a large pool of human resources 
and technical expertise, which has been applied to develop 
such “in-house” products as the twin-engine Challenger 
Business Jet. As a result, Bombardier suddenly held lead 
positions in numerous niche markets, which ensured ongo-
ing relations with such manufacturing giants as Boeing and 
MacDonnell Douglas. This acquisition quickly resulted in 
numerous contracts for CF-18 fighters from the Canadian 
government and contracts for Airbus components from 
both British Aerospace and France’s Aerospatiale.
Further acquisition was a logical step for the company. By 
acquiring Northern Ireland’s Short Brothers, Bombardier 
extended itself firmly into the European market as a sup-
plier and manufacturer of aerospace technology. At the out-
set of the 1990s, purchases of both Learjet out of Wichita, 
Kansas, and Boeing’s deHavilland propelled diversification 
into regional jets and turboprop aircraft. Finally, production 
of the first-of-its-kind 50-passenger Canadair Regional Jet 
signified Bombardier’s full-fledged entry into the airline 
industry. With the bulk of its profit already coming from this 
industry and the shared know-how, technology, resources, 
and markets of all of these companies pooled under one 
roof, Bombardier is ripe to become a major player in the 
aerospace industry through the millennium.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Over the past 10 years, US and Canadian airlines 
have begun to try to improve their competitive positions 
through a series of alliances. For example, Air Canada 
has become part of Star Alliance, a collection of currently 
27  international airlines—including United Airlines from 
the United States—that account for 21 percent of the 
 global market. Similarly, prior to merging with Air Canada 
in 2000, Canadian Airlines had joined American Airlines 
and its code-sharing partners around the world in the 
Oneworld alliance. This is a result of a trend that is group-
ing the international airline business into several large 
alliances to compete against each other. 
 For the North American Airline market, this means an 
increase in efficiency. In 1993 US carriers were authorized 
to serve only 44 routes in Canada, and Canadian carriers 
had a mere 28 routes in the United States. A study at the 
time revealed that, if the skies between the two countries 
were allowed to open up, air traffic would double within the 
next few years. The study also estimated that the resulting 
increase in tourism and trade would generate $10.3 billion 
in additional economic activity. These statistics indicate why 
a new Open Skies agreement between the countries was 
enacted in 1995 that liberalized the regulatory environment 
for airlines in both countries. Since the establishment of 
Open Skies, transborder traffic has increased from 13 mil-
lion passengers in 1994 to 20 million in 2000. Nonetheless, 
the 1995 treaty comes short of a full Open Skies agreement 
because of restrictions on cargo and third-country rights. 
 Since NAFTA came into effect on January 1, 1994, there 
was a further incentive to liberalize trade in services such 
as airline travel. However, under NAFTA’s restricted trans-
portation provisions, national treatment does not apply. 
This means that a US airline can do business across the 
Canadian borders only on a point-to-point basis, from, say, 
New York’s La Guardia to Toronto. It cannot pick up any 
passengers within Canada. Similarly, Air Canada can fly 
from Montreal to New York to Miami, but it cannot compete 
with US airlines on the internal New York to Miami route. 
 Despite the lack of national treatment, Air Canada has 
doubled its flights to the United States and more than 
tripled its number of routes since the Open Skies agree-
ment. Today, Air Canada handles over 40 percent of the 
Canada–US traffic and attributes close to 3,000 new jobs 
to the agreement. Air travel was further eased in 1998 
by a bilateral agreement to facilitate pre-clearance of 
 customs and immigration services. This will reduce double 
inspections by customs and immigration officers in both 
 countries. The large success of these agreements has led 
both governments to negotiate similar agreements with 
other countries around the globe.

July 18, 2001; Bombardier,  Annual Report , 2010. 
 Small business is a major part of the economy and accounts for almost 80 percent of all 
new employment in manufacturing. The service and retail trade industries are character-
ized by a large number of companies that vary in size; 70 percent of Canadians work in 
service industries.  
 Canada’s regulatory environment 
 Commerce and industry in Canada are regulated at every level of government: federal, pro-
vincial, and municipal. Many of these regulations are similar to those in the United States. 
 Competition 
 Regulation of competition is under the jurisdiction of the federal Parliament. Legislation 
in this area was revised in the late 1980s to eliminate restrictive trade policies,  stimulate 
 production, and promote the international competitiveness of Canadian business. 
Although there are no price controls in Canada, there is regulation to review monopolies, 
acquisitions, and mergers. The regulation of anti-competitive practices is handled under 
the   Competition Act  , which prohibits individuals and companies from practices that 
will substantially lessen or prevent competition in the marketplace. The Act outlaws bid 
 rigging, price discrimination, or conspiring to unduly lessen competition, and provides for 
 regulation of acquisitions and mergers. If the purchase price is $400 million or more, the 
parties must refrain from completing the transaction for a time period ranging from 7 to 
21 days. During this time the government reviews the situation and decides whether the 
purchase will prevent or lessen competition (using international comparisons) and thus be 
uncompetitive in nature. A ruling is then made. 
 Competition Act 
  A Canadian federal law 
that regulates anti-
competitive practices and 
prohibits actions that will 
substantially lessen or 
prevent competition; it is 
similar to US antitrust laws 

613
CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
 Exports and imports 
 Export permits are required for the shipment of goods having strategic value, such as 
 uranium. They are also required to implement the provisions of various international 
agreements into which Canada has entered. Import documentation is also required, as 
well as payment of a goods and sales tax (GST) or the federal part of the harmonized sales 
tax (HST) except for items speciﬁ ed as non-taxable importations. 5  The GST, which went 
into effect on January 1, 1991, is a value-added tax. On imports, it is collected by Canadian 
Customs. GST (5 percent) is payable on most goods at the time of importation. Effective 
July 1, 2010, the HST applies in the participating provinces at the following rates: 13 per-
cent in Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, 15 percent in Nova 
Scotia, and 12 percent in British Columbia. The GST applies in the rest of Canada at the 
rate of 5 percent. 6   
 Francization in Quebec 
 The Canadian federal government has a bilingual policy.       7  But in the province of Quebec, 
French is the ofﬁ cial language for business and education. All ﬁ rms employing 50 or more 
people in Quebec must use French at all levels of the organization. Other  regulations 
related to the use of French in Quebec are that: (1) all product labels must be in 
French, and translations cannot be given greater prominence than the French portion; 
(2)  company names and signs must be in French, but a version of the ﬁ rm’s name in 
another language may accompany the French version for use outside Quebec; and (3) all 
signs on the outside of stores must be in French only.       8  Moreover, all education, health 
services, and other services under provincial jurisdiction are delivered in French. Some 
exceptions to the French language and sign law policies accommodate the one-ﬁ fth of the 
Quebec population that speaks English. For example, McGill University and Concordia 
University can operate in English, and English signs can be displayed inside stores, pro-
vided they are smaller than French signs. 9  
 Banking and finance 
 Banks in Canada offer a full range of ﬁ nancial services. There are six large Canadian 
chartered banks with extensive national branch networks that account for 90 percent of 
the nation’s banking industry assets. There are also many smaller (often foreign-owned) 
banks. 10  All these banks respond to the actions of the central bank, the Bank of Canada, a 
federal government institution directly responsible for the nation’s monetary policy, includ-
ing (1) regulating credit and currency, (2) controlling and protecting the external value of

Has NAFTA increased trade between the United States and Canada? Why is this? 
 The data show that US–Canada trade has increased as a result of NAFTA. Three reasons 
can be cited. First, the elimination of all tariffs under NAFTA encouraged exports. Second, 
both countries are more likely to produce those goods and services for which they have a 
competitive advantage and to buy the others from their neighbor. Third, as the economies 
of the two countries grow, so will the amount of trade as each begins to adapt operations 
to the desires of the other and starts to tap this market further.   

614
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
the Canadian dollar, and (3) regulating the general level of production, trade, prices, and 
employment, within the scope of monetary policy. 
 In carrying out its functions, the Bank of Canada buys and sells foreign exchange and 
sets the interest rate charged to commercial banks. These functions are similar to those car-
ried out by the Federal Reserve in the United States, which helps monitor the US monetary 
system. The Bank of Canada is also responsible for issuing the country’s notes and coins 
and for managing the federal debt. Canadian interest rates and its exchange rate closely 
follow those set in the United States, especially in relation to non-North American interest 
and exchange rates. 
 Banks operate within the confines of the Bank Act. There are two types: Schedule A 
and Schedule B. Schedule A banks are Canadian owned and no shareholder has more 
than 10 percent of the voting stock. Schedule B banks are closely held Canadian-owned or 
foreign banks. These are allowed to carry on normal banking activities. However, foreign-
owned banks cannot, as a group, own more than 16 percent of the total domestic assets 
of the Canadian banking system. Subsidiaries of US banks are not subject to this restric-
tion because of the US–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In addition, Canadian banks are 
allowed to operate across the country. 
 There is also a host of specialized financial institutions that provide limited ser-
vices throughout the provinces. Examples include savings banks, cooperative credit 
unions, loan companies, mortgage companies, and insurance companies. Investment 
bankers provide short-term funds to companies for acquisition or reorganization 
purposes. 
 Canada has four major stock exchanges: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary. 
Toronto is the major exchange, accounting for approximately 95 percent of dollar trading 
volume. It is also the financial center of the country.       11 
 Labor relations 
 Labor relations are governed by both federal and provincial labor legislation. The   Canada 
Labor Code   is the federal law that covers such matters as wages, employment practices, 
work safety, and conciliation in the event of a labor dispute. Provincial governments have 
similar laws to cover employer–employee relations at the local level.  
 Unions 
 With the exception of farmers, domestic help, and white-collar workers, the workforce 
is heavily unionized. Approximately 30 percent of the total labor force is in unions, 
compared to approximately 13.5 percent in the United States. Average paid employ-
ment (employees) during the ﬁ rst half of 2010 was 14.3 million. However, since union 
membership rose slightly more rapidly than employment, the unionization rate edged 
up from 29.5 percent in 2009 to 29.6 percent in 2010. As women experienced dispro-
portionately more gains in unionized jobs, their unionization rate rose to 30.9 percent. 
The unionization rate for men remained constant at 28.2 percent. As a result, the gap 
in the rates between men and women widened further in 2010.       12  In some instances the 
workers are free to choose or reject union membership; in other cases they must become 
members in order to keep their jobs. The labor–management contract determines these 
conditions. 
 As in the United States, once a union has been certified to represent the workers, man-
agement must bargain in good faith. The result of such bargaining is a labor–management 
agreement that determines wage rates, fringe benefits, working conditions, and manage-
ment rights. Economic nationalism is a strong component of Canadian unionization, and 
the unions have been major opponents of the FTA, NAFTA, and other economic and 
political relationships with the United States.

CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
 Working conditions 
 All provinces have legislated minimum wage rates that are periodically adjusted. However, 
in most sectors wages and salaries are similar to US levels. 
 A national compulsory contributory pension plan provides retirement benefits to con-
tributors, generally at the age of 65. This age limit varies, however, and there is growing 
pressure to relax mandatory retirement rules. 13  In addition, many private pension plans 
are in effect. Other benefits include group life insurance, medical insurance, and subsidized 
food and housing. Most provincial legislation limits daily or weekly working hours, with 
mandatory overtime pay for hours worked in excess of these limits. The government also 
mandates minimum annual paid vacations in almost all industries, which is typically two 
weeks after a year of employment and up to three or four weeks after longer employment. 
There are also legislated holidays, which, depending on the city and the province, usually 
vary between 8 and 12 days. 
 All provinces prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of race, religion, 
national origin, color, sex, age, or marital status. There are also provisions for equal pay for 
equal work, which vary across provinces. They are designed to prevent gender bias in pay 
levels. For example, Ontario has specific “pay equity” legislation that requires employers 
to remove gender bias in pay levels; salary adjustments were phased in, starting in 1990. 
Similar legislation has been enacted in a number of other provinces, including Quebec and 
Saskatchewan. 
 Investments 
 The  Investment Canada Act (ICA)   came into effect on June 30, 1985, and is designed to cre-
ate a welcome climate for foreign investment by signiﬁ cantly loosening previous restrictions. 
At the same time, however, some regulations still remain in effect. As noted earlier, invest-
ments in certain industries are restricted. For example, a license to operate a broadcasting 
station can be granted only to a Canadian citizen or corporation whose stock is 80 percent 
owned by Canadian citizens or Canadian-controlled corporations. Generally, non-residents 
cannot hold more than 25 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of a chartered bank, 
a life insurance company, a sales ﬁ nance ﬁ rm, a loan company, or a trust company. Nor can 
a single non-resident together with his or her associates hold more than 10 percent of the 
issued and outstanding shares of these types of companies. Limits are much less stringent in 
the securities industry, but the government must be kept apprised of such ownership.  
 Under the ICA, a non-Canadian wishing to acquire a Canadian firm must apply 
to the ICA for review and approval, if the assets are valued at more than $5 million

How has NAFTA affected Mexico? 
 Mexico’s progress under NAFTA will create a market for US goods in that, as the middle 
and upper classes in the country increase their purchasing power, they will turn more and 
more to the purchase of US-made goods. From cars to television sets to home appliances, 
Mexican consumers will be buying products sold by US MNEs. The sale of these goods 
will create greater interest in Mexico by US multinationals, which will mean even greater 
opportunities for US firms—and Mexican consumers. The elimination of tariffs under 
NAFTA ties Mexico into the North American regional triad.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
or the business relates to Canada’s cultural heritage or national identity. In the case 
of US firms buying Canadian operations, under the provisions of the Free Trade 
Agreement the ICA review takes place at the $150 million level. So the investment 
climate is much more conducive to US investors than to any others. When the ICA 
does conduct a review, a number of factors are considered in determining whether the 
investment will benefit Canada, including employment, technological benefits, and 
product innovation. 
 In addition, numerous provincial statutes place restrictions on foreigners seeking to 
invest in particular industries or activities. For example, in most provinces individuals 
have to be Canadian residents for at least a year in order to be registered securities dealers. 
Similarly, foreigners who are registering ownership of land must disclose their citizen-
ship. In Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan, a majority of 
the board of directors of corporations must be resident Canadians. However, an indirect 
takeover of a foreign-owned publisher will require that the firm be sold to a Canadian 
owner, according to the “Baie Comeau Policy.” 
 Canada’s multinationals 
 It is useful to identify Canada’s major companies against the background of global com-
petition and triad power. Some larger Canadian ﬁ rms like Magna International and 
Bombardier are well known in the United States. 
  Table   19.4    ranks the 25 largest Canadian-owned companies in decreasing order of size 
measured by their sales in 2009. The largest firm is Manulife Financial Corp., which had 
revenues of over CAD $40.107 billion and is widely recognized as being one of Canada’s 
most successful multinationals. With revenues of $24.831 billion, Onex Corporation is a 
global investment conglomerate that operates in multiple industries, including sugar refin-
ing, investment, telecommunications, and automotive parts. Other well-known Canadian 
industrial multinationals at the top of the list are BCE (Bell Canada Enterprise), Bombardier, 
Magna International, and Research in Motion (RIM, best known as a developer of smart 
phone BlackBerry). 
  Table   19.5    lists the 25 largest foreign-owned firms in Canada. These firms also 
contribute to the performance of the country, creating jobs and wealth for Canadians. 
However, all foreign-owned firms must be examined in terms of their relationship to 
their parent companies. A high degree of autonomy, or development of world-class 
products in Canada, is necessary for a foreign-owned firm to provide sustained ben-
efits to the country. The Big Three auto companies have not done this. However, some 
energy firms, such as Imperial Oil (owned by Exxon Mobil), have a history of Canadian 
development, whereas others such as IBM Canada already operate divisions in Canada 
on a global basis. Others, such as Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), have a decentralized 
organizational structure with a large degree of local autonomy. These smaller but more 
autonomous Canadian firms (ABB is not on the list) have learned to survive within 
the global networks of their parent organizations, and their managers can help provide 
leadership to Canadians.   
 Another indicator of the nature of international expertise among these firms comes 
from the degree of their exports.  Table   19.4    also reports data on the foreign sales of the 
largest 25 Canadian-owned firms. Exports from Canadian sales of subsidiaries in the 
United States and others offshore (excluding the United States) are shown. According to 
the table, these large companies sell approximately 50 percent of their output abroad. The 
foreign-owned firms in Canada ( Table   19.5   ) also sell abroad, but information on foreign 
sales is not readily available. Nevertheless, the four companies that do report this infor-
mation export about 65 percent of their output.

This demonstrates the tremendous attraction of foreign markets for larger companies in 
a relatively small market like Canada’s, providing further evidence that access to a triad 
market (in this case, the United States) is critical for success in a global market. 
 Table  19.7 combines the information in the three previous tables in a new way and 
reports the sales of the 50 largest firms in North America. There are five non-North 
American firms in the list in  Table   19.7   . These are firms from Europe and Asia. The largest 
foreign-owned firm is Royal Dutch Shell, and in 2009 it had sales of $94 billion in North 
America which represented 33 percent of its total sales. The other non-North American 
firms are BP, Toyota Motor, ING Group, and Honda Motor.  Table   19.7    is based on the 
framework from Rugman (2005). It should be noted that all the North American firms in

 Table   19.7    are actually from the United States; there are none from Canada or Mexico. This 
table illustrates how difficult it is for non-US firms to establish a significant market  presence 
in the United States. However, as we go beyond the 50 largest firms reported in  Table  19.7 , 
there are more entries by Canadian, European, and Asian firms. This  information can be 
obtained by examination of the annual reports of companies across the triad.   
  Multilateral agreement on investment (MAI) 
 Canada will beneﬁ t from any type of multilateral agreement on investment. An attempt to 
negotiate an MAI was made in Paris at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) over the 1995 to 1998 period. The draft MAI was based on the lines 
of NAFTA. United Nations, UNCTAD Ministers may take up the need for an MAI. 
 An MAI includes the principle of national treatment: equal access for foreign investors 
to the host country’s market (but according to host-country rules). A number of sectors 
are exempted from the national treatment principle. In the same spirit of the FTA and 
NAFTA, Canada insists on exemptions on health care, education, social services, cultural 
industries, and transportation. All regulations on investment are identified, as are all 
exemptions to the principle of national treatment. Additionally, dispute-settlement mech-
anisms are put in place to allow individual investors (and companies) to appeal against

CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
government regulations and bureaucratic controls. The MAI helps countries harmonize 
their regulations, although in the areas of competition policy and tax policy not much 
progress can be expected (no progress was achieved in NAFTA). 
 The need for an MAI arises because foreign investment has become an important part 
of the global economy. Today, the majority of international business is not done by traded 
goods but through services and investments. More than 70 percent of North Americans 
work in the service sector, with only 30 percent in manufacturing. So the new agenda for 
international agreements is to negotiate rules for trade in services and investment. 
 Canada’s outward stock of FDI is nearly 75 percent in the United States, with which it 
already has national treatment through the FTA and NAFTA. Thus, its exporting businesses 
would prefer an MAI with transparent rules.  
  Business opportunities in Canada 
 Although the Canadian economy began to slow down during the early 1990s, the country 
still offers excellent investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors. This is partic-
ularly true for US ﬁ rms, thanks to the US–Canada FTA of 1989 and its extension, the   North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) , which includes Mexico. 14 
 The  United States–Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA)   was designed to eliminate 
tariffs and most other trade barriers between the two countries.       15  Some of its specific 
provisions are: 
 1  All tariffs on US and Canadian goods were to be eliminated by 1998. 
 2  Most import and export quotas were to be eliminated by 1998. 
 3   Use of product standards as a trade barrier is prohibited and national treatment of 
testing labs and certification bodies is established.  
 4   Many restrictions on agricultural products, wine and distilled spirits, auto parts, and 
energy goods have been sharply reduced, if not totally eliminated.  
 5  The size of the government procurement markets that will be open to suppliers from 
the other country is slightly increased.  
 6   Travel by business visitors, investors, traders, professionals, and executives transferred 
within a firm is facilitated.  
 7   The opportunity to invest in each other’s country is facilitated and encouraged through 
the adoption of national treatment. 
 8   A binational commission to resolve disagreements that may arise from the enforcement 
of the FTA has been established; it dealt with some 20 cases in the first three years of the 
agreement. 16 
 Marketing in Canada 
 Companies doing business in Canada need to know the distribution practices and advertis-
ing and promotion channels. In many cases these are similar to those in other countries, but 
there are some important differences. 
 Distribution practices 
 Despite the country’s vast size, sales to Canadian industries are characterized by short mar-
keting channels with direct producer-to-user distribution. Many industries are dominated 
by a few large-scale enterprises that are highly concentrated geographically. It is not unusual 
for 90 percent of prospective customers of an industrial product to be located in or near 
two or three cities.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 The consumer goods market is more diffused than the industrial market, and the use 
of marketing intermediaries is often necessary. In many cases complete coverage of the 
consumer market requires representation in a number of commercial centers across 
the country. Firms having only one representative or distribution point typically choose 
Toronto. If the country is divided into two major markets, the other is often Calgary or 
Vancouver. If the market is divided into three areas, distributors are frequently put in 
Montreal, Ontario, and Vancouver.       17 
 Direct selling is another growing area. This includes the sale of goods from manufactur-
ing premises by mail, home delivery, personal selling, and other non-retail channels. Direct 
selling now accounts for over $2.18 billion annually in Canada, with 11.2 percent growth 
in the past five years. 18 
 Wholesale and retail trade are also important forms of distribution. Because of the wide 
dispersion of customers, wholesale trade is critical. However, retail trade is even more 
important and accounts for more than $393 billion in sales in 2010.       19  Independent stores 
earn about 88 percent of this, and general merchandisers, including department stores, 
make up the other 12 percent. 20  Quebec and Ontario account for about 61 percent of all 
retail sales, and in western Canada, British Columbia and Alberta make up approximately 
24 percent of the total. 21  Department stores and supermarkets constitute a large percentage 
of retail sales. However, as in the United States, they are facing increased competition from 
discount food stores, showroom retailing, and other forms of self-service retailing. There 
are also specialized markets for recreation and leisure equipment and associated services, 
as well as a growing demand for consumer durables. These trends are likely to continue 
well into the future.  
 Advertising and promotion 
 Media used for advertising in Canada include television, radio, newspapers, and magazines. 
Television and radio advertising are particularly popular because 97 percent of all Canadian 
households have at least one television, and 99 percent have at least one radio. Hundreds 
of private ﬁ rms operate cable television and major broadcasting stations in metropolitan 
areas, and the country has more than 1,300 television stations and 550 cable television sys-
tems, with over 50 percent of the population hooked into a cable system. In addition, the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) operates two national television networks, one 
in English and one in French. There are 1,400 licensed AM and FM radio stations. 
 More than 100 daily newspapers are published in Canada and are widely used by 
advertisers, as are trade magazines directed at specific industries such as computers, real 
estate, banking, and retailing. General interest Canadian magazines such as  Reader’s Digest , 
L’actualité , and  Quest  have raised their share of net advertising expenditures in Canadian 
periodicals to about 30 percent, approaching the advertising of national newspapers. Two 
business newspapers,  The National Post ( Financial Post  section) and  The Globe and Mail 
( Report on Business  section), also are widely read in the business and financial community. 
More than 450 advertising agencies in Canada can be of assistance in developing advertis-
ing and promotion campaigns. 
 Exporting 
 One of the most popular ways of doing business in Canada is through exports. As noted 
earlier, Canada is the United States’ largest foreign market. Every year Canadians buy 
as much US goods as do all the member nations of the EU combined. In fact, over 20 
percent of all US exports go to Canada. In recent years the Canadian government has 
simpliﬁ ed the process for shipping goods into the country. This is particularly true for 
products coming from the United States, since duties have been eliminated, thanks to 
the FTA and NAFTA.  

623
CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
 Franchising 
 Canada is the dominant foreign market for US franchisers. Currently more than 300 
US franchise firms operate approximately 10,000 franchise units in Canada. A recent 
report by  Entrepreneur  magazine rated more than 1,100 US franchises, and of those in 
the top 10, 8 indicated they were seeking to establish franchises in Canada. Thus, there 
is a great deal of opportunity for those who want to do business in Canada via the fran-
chise route. 
 Additionally, in recent years Canadian banks have become more responsive to the needs 
of franchised operations. Chartered banks now offer various loans and repayment plans for 
franchises. In some cases they also offer payroll and cash management services. So there is 
considerable opportunity in international franchise operations in Canada.

 How has NAFTA affected the United States? 
 NAFTA will lead to an increase in trade in the region for three reasons. First, the elimi-
nation of all tariffs will encourage exports. Second, all three countries are more likely 
to specialize in producing those goods and services for which they have a competitive 
advantage and, in turn, buy the others from their neighbors. Third, as the economies of the 
member countries grow, so will the amount of trade as each begins to adapt operations to 
the desires of the other and starts to tap this market. Furthermore, the United States has 
more secure access to energy and other vital natural resources from Canada and Mexico. 
 With a land area of approximately 760,000 square miles (1.9 million km 2 ), Mexico is 
equal in size to almost 25 percent of the contiguous United States. It is the third-largest 
nation in Latin America and has a population of over 112 million. The country is a 
federal democratic republic divided into 31 states and the Federal District (Mexico 
City). Although it endured political turmoil early in the twentieth century and recent 
drug war in the twenty first century, the government has been stable since World War 
II. Mexico is a nation where affluence, poverty, natural splendour and urban blight rub 
shoulders. 22  
 Mexico’s economy 
 Mexico’s economy is currently in a state of ﬂ ux, brought on by new economic relations 
with the United States. Today Mexico has the strongest economy in Latin America. One 
of the primary reasons has been the economic policies of Carlos Salinas, who, after 
becoming president in 1988, introduced liberalization rules regarding foreign invest-
ment and privatization. These changes have dramatically improved the economy. GDP 
growth in 1996 was 5.1 percent, but inﬂ ation continued to remain in the range of 25 per-
cent. The GDP growth rate was 6.5 percent 5 percent respectively for 2009 and 2010, but 
 MEXICO 

624
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
inﬂ ation had also been reduced to 4.1 percent.       23  The country has also vigorously promoted 
exports, especially to the United States, which now counts on Mexico for 25 percent of 
all imported fruit and vegetables. The  maquiladora  industry (see  Chapter 10 ) is another 
growing source of economic strength for the country.       24  At the same time, Mexico has 
become a major region for international investment. In the first six months of 2010 
Foreign direct investment climbed nearly 30 per cent compared to a year earlier. 
 MNE investment 
 The climate for foreign investment in Mexico has grown increasingly favorable in recent 
years. Although there were strict controls on foreign investment during the 1970s, regu-
lations introduced in 1989 reversed many of these restrictions. As a result, an increasing 
number of MNEs are investing in Mexico. Nissan invested $1 billion in a new assem-
bly plant to produce cars for export to both the United States and Japan; Volkswagen 
invested $950 million to expand its plant; Sears Roebuck put $150 million into new 
stores and malls throughout the country, in addition to renovating older units; Wal-
Mart purchased Cifra, a successful Mexican retailer; and PepsiCo expanded its snack 
business by purchasing a majority stake in Gamesa, Mexico’s largest cookie maker. 
 One of the major reasons for the increase in FDI is the privatization campaign that 
began in 1982 and that has picked up speed since then. By 2000, the number of state-
owned enterprises had decreased to 200 from 1,000 prior to 1982.       25  The government con-
tinues to play a major role in the economy, primarily through state-owned entities such as 
the giant oil firm Pemex, but there has been significant reduction in its ownership. These 
sales have been made to both foreign companies and Mexican investors. 
 Another reason for increased FDI has been the changes in investment laws that now 
permit foreigners to hold major equity positions. In the past, foreign ownership in auto 
parts companies had been limited to 40 percent of equity, but a new decree now sharply 
reduces the number of firms subject to this law by creating exemptions based on per-
centages of export sales and sales to individuals. Today, approximately 80 percent of the 
economy is open to full foreign ownership.       26 
 Labor 
 Labor is relatively plentiful and inexpensive. However, MNEs report a serious shortage 
of skilled labor and managerial personnel, particularly at the middle and upper levels 
of the organization, and despite numerous engineers. Worker absenteeism in recent 
years has declined, but turnover remains a serious problem, even in the  maquiladora 
sector. 
 Approximately 40 percent of the total workforce is unionized. In industrial operations 
with more than 25 workers, about 80 percent of the workforce is in unions. Union con-
trol over the members has weakened in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. 
However, strikes are not uncommon. 
 There is a three-tier minimum wage structure in Mexico, but increases have not kept up 
with the cost of living. The minimum wage in Mexican Peso in Mexico City and surrounding 
towns in 2011 is 59.82 per day (Zone A, including Baja California, Federal District, State of 
Mexico and large cities), compared to 58.13 Pesos (Zone B, including Sonora, Nueovo Leon, 
Tamaulipas, Veracruz, and Jalisco) in many other large cities and 56.70 Pesos (Zone C in the 
rest of the country). 27  
 Government regulations require that at least 90 percent of a firm’s skilled and 
unskilled workers be Mexican nationals, and employers must favor Mexicans over 
foreigners and union personnel over non-union personnel. On the other hand, these 
regulations are unlikely to limit investment by MNEs since the government permits 
hiring exceptions.   

625
CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
 Mexico and NAFTA 
 In conjunction with their privatization policies, Mexico sought to motivate business 
through increased exposure to international competitive forces and access to the dynamic 
US market. 28  To this end, the government opened negotiations with the US and Canadian 
governments in Toronto on June 12, 1991, to create NAFTA. This marked the ﬁ rst time 
that a less developed country had entered into an agreement with two wealthy countries to 
create a free trade area. NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, and has had a major 
impact on Mexico’s trade and investment. 
 Trade in several sectors has experienced considerable growth. In the textile and apparel 
sectors, quotas on Mexican products were phased out and customs duties on all textile and 
apparel products were eliminated. For automotive products, Mexico immediately reduced 
its tariffs on cars and light trucks by 50 percent and pledged to eliminate the remaining 
duties over 10 years. In agriculture, tariff restrictions were lifted on a broad range of goods 
when NAFTA went into effect. 
 Mexico’s investment climate has also been affected by NAFTA. In the automotive sec-
tor, all investment restrictions were eliminated. In transportation, Mexico allowed 49 
percent ownership of cars and trucking companies three years after NAFTA went into 
effect, 51 percent after 10 years, and 100 percent after 10 years. The Mexican finance and 
insurance sectors have also been liberalized. All these changes have opened up Mexico even 
more to FDI and, in turn, led to the growth of the Mexican economy and two-way flows of 
trade and investment with the United States. 
 As with the US–Canada FTA, binational panels play an important role in resolving trade 
disputes. Under NAFTA, panels continue to contribute toward trade disputes resolution 
and now also investment matters. Where investments are concerned, complainants may 
also take their cases to binding investor–state arbitration.  
 Regional trade agreements 
 Other developments involving Mexico as a leader in the movement toward free trade and 
privatization have included the efforts to create and sustain regional trade agreements 
based on NAFTA. One of the major regional integration efforts has been the  creation 
of the   Latin American Integration Association (LAIA)  , a free trade group formed in 
1980 to reduce intra-regional trade barriers and promote regional economic coop-
eration. Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, 
Uruguay, and Venezuela are all members. The primary objective of LAIA is to create a 
Latin American common market. In recent years, its slow process toward economic inte-
gration has led some members to create subregional groups. For example, in the south-
ern cone, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay have established a common market 
called   Mercosur  , which was operational by 1996. In the north, Mexico, Colombia, and 
Venezuela have a similar agreement, and via NAFTA Mexico is likely to be a key bridge 
between Latin American countries and the United States. NAFTA has a clause permitting 
accession of other countries. A second major integration effort is the   Andean common 
market (Ancom)  , a subregional free trade compact designed to promote economic and 
social integration and cooperation. 29  Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela 
are all members.  
 In 1990, US President George Bush launched his   Enterprise for the Americas , which 
is aimed at creating an all-American free trade area from Alaska to Argentine Antarctica. 
The   Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)   that is presently being negotiated by 34 
countries would achieve the main objectives of continental integration.       30  If such an idea 
comes to fruition, it will eliminate the need for LAIA, Ancom, and similar Latin American

trade agreements. The United States is aware of the need for reducing, and then eliminat-
ing, trade barriers in the Americas if it hopes to establish a viable world market that can 
compete against the European Union and the Asia–Pacific countries. The idea is also 
appealing to Latin American countries that see the opportunities associated with linking 
into the North American diamond and profiting from the economic growth it creates. This 
development will bring about a Western hemisphere trading bloc and may well become a 
reality in the early twenty-first century.    
  Doing business in Mexico 
 A number of strategic approaches are being used to conduct business in Mexico. (See 
the case  International Business Strategy in Action: Mexico and NAFTA .) Two primary 
reasons for the success of these approaches are the high quality of the workforce and the 
dramatic improvement in the economy over the 1990s. MNEs operating in Mexico report 
that the quality of the workforce is excellent. For example, senior-level executives at ﬁ rms 
such as Caterpillar, Ford, General Electric, IBM, and Procter & Gamble all report that their 
Mexican workforces produce high-quality output. Moreover, a Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology study has named Ford’s Mercury Tracer plant in Hermosillo the highest-quality 
assembly plant in the world. The head of IBM Mexico has stated that “for every dollar you 
pay a Mexican engineer, you get more from him or her than you’d get in other societies 
around the world.” 31 
 At the same time, the market for goods and services is growing rapidly. Many 
MNEs admit that they are not in Mexico because of the low wage rates but because of 
rapidly growing demand. Despite a high inflation rate and loss of purchasing power, 
people want to buy consumer goods and live more like their neighbors to the north. 
Mexicans are also expressing an interest in high-quality merchandise, with the result 
that  companies are now reducing their reliance on agents and dealers and are instead 
opening sales subsidiaries and warehouses to provide direct technical assistance. A 
good  example is Toyota, which started a plant in 2005 to produce vans for the US 
market, but later in the year responded to Mexico’s growing demand for vans by 
 producing for the domestic market. With a burgeoning population of 106 million and 
an economy that is growing even faster, Mexico promises to be a major target area for 
MNEs in the future. 32  At the same time, these developments help Mexico link itself to 
the triad via the United States.

 Does NAFTA include environmental laws? 
 There are environmental laws in NAFTA, but these are still up for debate. There are issues 
of sovereignty. Should an international agreement set the standard for environmental 
laws or should the individual governments make their own laws to be responsive to their 
national needs? Although an environmental chapter was included in NAFTA, there is a 
growing concern among NGOs that environmental laws could be used as a non-tariff 
barrier to trade, keeping out some goods from the rich US market. Both the US and 
Canada advocate the use of clean technology in NAFTA and press for higher environmental 
standards and processes in Mexico.   

627
CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Mexico and NAFTA 
 Many opponents of NAFTA argued that the agreement 
would lead to the export of US jobs to Mexico, with a result-
ing decline in gross national product (GNP). Economists, 
however, reported that the agreement would help save 
US jobs and that GNP would rise by $30 billion annually 
once the treaty was fully implemented. Recent research 
also found that the first five years of NAFTA had improved 
growth and efficiency in all three of its members. Certainly, 
MNEs in the motor vehicle and parts industry and the 
telecommunications industry agreed with the economists 
and have already formulated strategies to address these 
impending changes. 
 The US motor vehicle and parts industry expects to 
see some jobs go to Mexico. Moreover, the export of 
 vehicles from foreign-owned factories in Mexico doubled 
in the three years after NAFTA. However, prior to NAFTA, 
Mexican government regulations forced US auto makers 
to buy Mexican parts, which in many cases did not meet 
global standards. This led Mexican subsidiaries of the auto 
makers to run plants at less than maximum  efficiency 
levels. The government also forced the Big Three car 
companies to export more than they imported into Mexico. 
NAFTA has allowed companies to act regionally instead of 
on a country-by-country basis and to reorganize production 
more efficiently across North America. In an unexpected 
surge of events, some of the manufacturing previously 
assigned to Mexico is being brought back into the United 
States. For example, Ford relocated its production of 
Thunderbirds and Mercury Cougars from Cuautitlan to 
its assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio. At the same time, US 
auto suppliers are doing better because NAFTA requires 
62.5 percent of a vehicle’s content to originate in North 
America. This means that foreign suppliers in Asia and 
Europe are losing out to regional, high-quality firms such 
as TRW and Dana. Thus, NAFTA is proving to be a boon to 
the US motor and auto parts industry. 
 Telecommunications is another industry in which US 
firms are doing very well. Annual US telecom exports to 
Mexico are now in excess of $2.8 billion, and Telmex, the 
previously state-owned phone company, is 9.1 percent 
owned by SBC. In 2001, Telmex had 24.2 million phones 
wired in an all-digital network, up from 12 million in 
1993, and US companies have supplied much of this new 
equipment. At the same time, some business customers 
in Mexico feel it is taking too long for Telmex to provide 
the service they need, so they are purchasing private 
networks that carry voice, data, and images by satellite. 
Scientific-Atlanta, a Georgia-based firm, is the market 
leader in this area and has been able to land a series of 
large contracts for installing communication systems, 
including those for Cifra, the country’s largest retailer, 
and for the Mexican Navy. Other companies likely to ben-
efit from the growing market include McCaw, Cantel, and 
Motorola. As a result, US telecom firms appear to have 
found a lucrative market just south of the border. 
 Doing business in Mexico can take a number of differ-
ent forms. Four strategies have proven particularly prof-
itable. One is to establish a wholly owned subsidiary. This 
can be an expensive strategy, but it gives the company 
total control and allows management to make decisions 
quickly and efficiently. Quite often a local manager runs 
the subsidiary, and almost always the majority of the 
management team are locals. However, headquarters 
exercises key control. 
 A second approach is to become part of the  maquiladora 
program. This strategy works best for firms aiming to 
export most of their output back to the United States. The 
 maquiladora  arrangement allows manufacturing, assem-
bly, and processing plants to import materials, compo-
nents, and equipment duty free, complete the work with 
Mexican labor, and then ship the finished products back 
north. Under recent changes in the arrangement, if the 
company wants, it can sell up to one-third of the output in 
Mexico and still participate in the program. 
 A third approach is the so-called shelter program, 
under which local contractors assume responsibility for all 
aspects of the manufacturing operation, from site selection 
to recruitment of personnel to running the factory. After 
a predetermined time, however, the US company can buy 
out the shelter operator at a preset price and take over the 
business. 
 A fourth approach is a joint venture with a local partner. 
This combines a foreign company with financial and manu-
facturing know-how and a local partner that knows how 
to market the output. A number of US firms have opted 
for this approach, including Ford, DuPont, and General 
Electric. In the last case, GE formed a joint venture with 
MABE, one of Mexico’s largest appliance manufacturers. 
Since then, the two have opened a gas range plant that now 
produces 800,000 units annually for the US, Canadian, and 
Mexican markets. 
 In most cases US MNEs will decide in advance which 
of these four strategies to implement. However, some 
firms have discovered that the need for such a decision 
▼

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
  Mexico and the double diamond 
 To maintain its economic growth, Mexico must continue developing international com-
petitive strength. 33  This is currently being done by linking to the US market.       34  In particular, 
MNEs must view this market not just as a source for export but also as part of the home 
market (see  Figure  10.6 ). Speciﬁ cally, this requires: 
 1   Developing innovative new products and services that simultaneously meet the needs of 
US and Mexican customers, with the recognition that close relationships with demand-
ing US customers should set the pace and style of product development.  
 2   Drawing on the support industries and infrastructure of both the US and Mexican 
diamonds, realizing that the US diamond is more likely to possess deeper and more 
efficient markets for such industries.  
 3  Making free and full use of the physical and human resources in both countries.       35 
 To do this, Mexico is relying heavily on a series of strategic clusters. The six major 
ones, in order of importance, are petroleum/chemicals, automotive, housing and house-
hold, materials and metals, food and beverage, and semiconductors and computers. The 
two that are most internationally competitive and provide the best insights into how the 
Mexican double diamond is used are the petroleum and automotive clusters. 
 Petroleum cluster 
 Mexico’s petroleum industry accounted for about 8 percent of all exports in 2004. The 
country has the third-largest proven oil reserves after Venezuela and the United States and 
is the world’s ﬁ fth-largest producer. The largest ﬁ rm is state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos 
(Pemex), which is the world’s largest crude oil producer (does not include reﬁ ning) and the 
world’s 65th-largest company. In 2009, Pemex had total assets of nearly $103 billion, includ-
ing pipelines, reﬁ neries, tankers, aircraft, and rail cars. This huge asset base helps explain 
why Mexico is a net exporter of energy, principally oil, natural gas, hydraulic power, nuclear 
and geothermal power, and coal. 
 The country also has strong petroleum-related industries and infrastructure. At present, 
175 companies are operating about 500 basic and secondary petrochemical plants through-
out the country and employing approximately 130,000 people. 
 Domestic demand of oil-related products in Mexico has been rising sharply, forcing 
Pemex to become considerably more productive. The export market for this oil is expected 
to remain at current levels for the foreseeable future. The United States will remain 
Mexico’s largest customer. Moreover, although energy was excluded from NAFTA, ongo-
ing discussions have centered on US access to Mexican oil through imports and increased 
opportunities for US technologies in the energy sector. For major US companies such as 
Arco, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips that are selling off some of their domestic properties 
and looking for exploration opportunities outside the country, Mexico is likely to prove 
is unanticipated. Take the example of Pace Foods, which 
went to Mexico City to film commercials for its Pace 
Picante Sauce. The crew did not want to carry back the 
jars of Pace’s hot sauce that they used in the filming, so 
they told a local store manager to keep the jars and try to 
sell them. A few weeks later the company got a call from 
the manager. He had sold all 350 jars and wanted to know 
what he should do now. Today Pace has a thriving business 
selling products in Mexico.

CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
a very attractive location. Turnkey exploration contracts are being used to integrate US 
expertise and improve Mexican drilling efficiency, thus reducing the cost of oil. This trend 
will make Mexico one of the lowest-cost producers in the world. 
 The commodity nature of the energy business provides little opportunity for Mexico to 
insulate itself from the cyclical changes of both pricing and demand in this cluster. The real 
opportunities lie in trying to improve efficiencies through various methods: (1) liberalizing 
exploration programs by allowing more efficient foreign drilling contractors to carry out 
turnkey operations; (2) reducing the cost base by working with the unions to rationalize 
jobs that are not required; (3) using foreign technologies in areas where Mexican expertise 
is lacking; (4) allowing greater participation of foreign firms in producing petrochemicals 
to expand capacity and competitiveness of commodity products to meet domestic and 
export demand; (5) using foreign MNEs to bring in technology to produce advanced 
petrochemicals for use in the US market; and (6) developing alternative, cleaner-burning 
fuels, such as natural gas and unleaded fuels, to reduce reliance on US imports and comply 
with international environmental standards. 
 The potential of this cluster looks promising, even though Mexican proven reserves 
have recently fallen slightly and the international benchmark price for crude oil has varied 
from $20 to $150 per barrel. Mexico’s vast unexplored areas provide long-term oppor-
tunities to continue a strong hydrocarbon-based cluster. Moreover, the proximity of the 
United States, with its declining proven reserves and growing dependence on imports, 
will provide Mexico with an export base for improving economies of scale and generating 
funds for reinvestment in drilling and exploration activities. Thus, Mexico’s economic 
progress will be closely linked to the US diamond.  
 Automotive cluster 
 The global auto industry is currently undergoing worldwide restructuring. In the process, 
Mexico is emerging as a major car and truck producer. Since 1986 the industry has grown 
rapidly: total unit production in 2002 was 2 million units; however, in 2009, the total unit 
production was 1,561,052, a drop of 28 percent compared to 2008 due to the world ﬁ nan-
cial crisis leading to fall in exports. Automobile accounts for 15 percent of all exports; 
85 percent of all Mexican-built cars are exported to the United States.       36  The Big Three US 
auto makers have been expanding their capacities in Mexico while closing plants in the 
United States and Canada. Today, Daimler, Ford, and GM account for about 60 percent of 
all light-vehicle production. At the same time, European and Japanese ﬁ rms are investing 
in Mexico in an effort to tap such beneﬁ ts as low-cost labor, low capital cost, proximity to 
the world’s largest auto market, growth of domestic demand, and accessibility to related 
support industries. 
 Mexico has a strong, rich resource base supporting its automotive cluster as well as an 
abundance of young, skilled, adaptable labor. Foreign auto firms are finding that these 
workers are particularly effective after they have been trained in total quality management, 
just-in-time inventory, and related concepts. In addition, unions in Mexico are much 
more cooperative with management than their counterparts to the north. As a result, 
this resource base is now producing some of the highest-quality cars and trucks in North 
America, and the Hermosillo plant is widely regarded as the number one auto factory on 
the continent. 
 There are also strong supporting industries and a well-developed infrastructure in the 
automotive cluster. The auto parts industry has revenues of $2.93 billion and growing at an 
annual rate of 10 percent and employs over 500,000 Mexican workers, a five-fold increase 
since 1990. 37  Parts companies produce for both the domestic and export markets, and 
many are a result of FDI by US-based auto part firms. For example, GM has component 
plants in the country as well as financial participation with Mexican auto part companies. 

630
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
Ford has similar arrangements, as do Volkswagen, Nissan, and a host of other foreign 
firms. In fact, 30 new auto parts companies settled in Mexico between 1996 and 1998. In 
one instance, the decision by Volkswagen to produce the VW Beetle fueled foreign invest-
ment in auto parts to meet the increasing demand.       38 
 While the boom of foreign investment in auto parts initially displaced inefficient local 
parts producers, a handful of efficiently run local companies have emerged to become 
 multinational producers. For instance, with an initial $30 million investment, Mexico’s 
Nemak has opened a plant in the Czech Republic that employs 200 people. 
 The primary customers for auto output in Mexico are in the local market. However, the 
percentage of this output that goes for export is rising every year. In particular, with the 
signing of NAFTA, Mexico’s accessibility to the largest auto market in the world is increas-
ing sharply. This accessibility is especially critical to the country since US protectionism is 
now threatening to raise import barriers. At the same time, Mexican acceptance of US cars 
manufactured in Mexico is at an all-time high. The same is true in the United States, where 
the quality reputation of Mexican assembly plants is being felt at the dealer showroom. 
 The market potential of the automotive cluster is extremely high. Some problems, 
however, will have to be dealt with if the country is to continue increasing its competitive-
ness. 39  Foremost among these is the need for greater technology. One major reason why 
Mexican autos are cost efficient is the lack of high automation and robotics. It is unlikely 
that this trend can continue. In addition, the shifting of more and more US and Canadian 
auto business to Mexico will put major pressure on NAFTA to ensure that these two 
 countries benefit handsomely from this strategy and that other foreign producers, such as 
the Japanese and Europeans, do not. 
 Overall, Mexico’s economic future is closely linked to that of the United States and 
Canada. When analyzed in terms of Porter’s Diamond, some of the country’s strategic 
clusters have already developed worldwide competitive strength. During the 1990s the 
petroleum and automotive clusters proved to be highly competitive. 
 Mexico is likely to begin making major inroads into other areas such as semiconductors 
and computers. Motorola already has a semiconductor plant in Mexico, and HP, IBM, 
Toshiba, Samsung, NEC, Philips, and others produce computer hardware components 
in Mexican facilities. As in its automotive success, this is the result of favorable factor 
 conditions, related and supporting industries, demand conditions, and the structure and 
rivalry of the firms. As a result, Mexico will find that it can link its diamond framework 
with that of the United States and become a worldwide competitor in still other areas in the 
process. Porter’s Diamond framework will prove to be a useful paradigm.       40 
 1   Canada is the single largest trading partner of the United States. There has been a 
move toward privatization in the past few years as well as toward deregulation. As in 
the United States, the government attempts to promote competition, and the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico has recognized the high degree 
of trade between the two countries.  
 2   Financial institutions are similar to those in the United States, as are labor relations 
practices. However, a much larger percentage of Canadian employees are unionized, 
and the unions have been major opponents of the FTA and the subsequent NAFTA.  
 3   NAFTA will eventually eliminate most trade barriers between the United States and 
Canada, which should help open up Canada to more economic development. At the 
same time, the government welcomes foreign investment, and a wide variety of incen-
tive programs are designed to encourage such investments.  
 KEY POINTS 

631
CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
 4   The approaches to doing business in Canada are similar to those in the United States, 
with some important regulatory differences. The chapter identified and discussed both.  
 5  Mexico has the strongest economy in Latin America, and its close business ties to the 
United States, as reflected by imports, exports, and US FDI, bode well for its future. The 
potential of the free trade agreement between the two countries and the growth of the 
 maquiladora  industry are helping Mexico link its economy to that of the United States. 
Mexico’s petrochemical and automotive clusters are key industries in this linkage and 
are likely to become world-class competitors in their respective areas.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 REAL CASE 
 Jumex of Mexico 
 Founded in 1961, Group Jumex is the largest producer of 
juices and fruit nectars in Mexico. The country has a popu-
lation of 106 million people and a hot climate that provides 
a favorable environment in which Jumex can grow. And 
grow it has. 
 Mexico offered other nurturing characteristics to the 
emerging company in the form of natural resources 
and market pressures. For one, Jumex has access to 
an incredible variety of tropical fruits from which it can 
develop new products. Indeed, the firm offers tamarind, 
guanabana, and guava nectars as well as the more com-
monly known mango, peach, pear, and apple. 
 Tropical fruits are readily available everywhere at a 
relatively low price, making the blending of juices in cus-
tomers’ homes extremely easy. Juice stands, in which the 
juice is made on site, are abundant throughout the country. 
Quality is paramount. Jumex cannot sell products with very 
little fruit content to Mexicans. 
 Jumex competes with other domestic producers at 
home for the juice and nectar market. It also competes 
with soft drink makers, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, 
for the beverage market. However, Mexican  consumers 
have recently improved the lot of the juice makers, 
as  carbonated drinks are increasingly  considered 
unhealthful. 
 Competition has made Jumex into an aggressive mar-
keter. The firm uses all types of distribution system to 
maximize market share. It works with national whole-
salers, regional wholesalers, supermarkets, and small 
convenience stores to establish a price system that allows 
them to benefit from selling its products. 
 Mobile communication was provided to the sales team 
so that orders could be processed immediately no mat-
ter how far away the distribution center was. This is very 
important because of the remoteness of many Mexican 
communities. Prior to this, a salesperson could take two 
weeks before returning with paperwork to put in an order. 
Supermarket computerized distribution systems are now 
integrated with that of Jumex so that their shelves can be 
stocked as needed. 
 While most firms have shifted to aluminum, Jumex has 
maintained the traditional tin can and created a distinct 
shape that stands out against the competition. A tin can is 
alleged to be more biodegradable than an aluminum can. 
To serve different markets, Jumex also packages in plastic, 
glass, and juice boxes. 
 Presently, Jumex exports only about 20 percent of its 
production but it is highly successful. It has operations in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, Europe, 
Asia, and Oceania. Distribution and marketing have been 
adapted to fit each country. In most of Latin America, 
because of geographic, market, and cultural similarities, 
the distribution system that was implemented was very 
similar to that found in Mexico. 
 Jumex has been surprisingly successful in the US mar-
ket, where it is now a leading brand of fruit nectars. Part of 
this success can be attributed to Mexico’s lower production 
costs and the availability of inexpensive natural resources. 
Another reason is the predominance of Mexican immi-
grants across the United States, particularly in large urban 
areas. Whether these are new immigrants or the children 
of immigrants who travel frequently to Mexico, they know 
the product and are familiar with the tropical fruits, creat-
ing an initial market for the product. Other Latin Americans 
or immigrants from tropical areas familiar with the brand 
or the fruits also push demand. 
 Another factor that has helped Jumex in developed 
countries is that its products are considered healthier 
than carbonated drinks and tend to offer more fruit 
 content than many of its domestic competitors. However, 
 competition in developed countries is likely to heat up in 
the future as Ceres, a South African juice producer, Jugos 
del Valle of Mexico, and new entrants from Asia compete 
in price, quality, and variety of fruit juices. In the health 
market sector, organic fruit juices from developing and 
developed countries will also offer competition.

CHAPTER 19 NORTH AMERICA
 GlaxoSmithKline in the United States 
 Among industrialized countries, the US market for phar-
maceuticals is the least regulated and thus the largest 
in the world. Not surprisingly, European companies like 
AstraZeneca, Aventis, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) depend 
more heavily on the North American market for their 
revenues than on Europe as a whole. Europe is a more 
fragmented market, with individual distribution systems 
and more layers of regulation, and governments are in the 
habit of imposing price controls. As a result, Europeans 
spend 60 percent less per capita on pharmaceuticals than 
their American counterparts. 
 With $44.240 billion in revenues and 98,854 employees in 
2009, GSK is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies 
in the world. Although incorporated in the United Kingdom, 
it is not surprising that GSK manages its operations in the 
United States. Some 30 percent of its sales originate in this 
host nation, a fact that is consistent with world trends—the 
United States accounts for nearly 50 percent of the world 
market for pharmaceuticals. GSK derives 25 percent of its 
sales from its home-market region. Indeed the European 
market accounts for 25 percent of the world market for 
pharmaceuticals. Only 9 percent of its sales come from 
Asia/Japan, 10 percent from emerging markets and the 
remainder is derived from ViiV health care (HIV business), 
other trading and unallocated activities. 
 Approximately 30 years ago, British Glaxo was a 
small company in the dried milk, antibiotics,  respiratory 
drugs, and nutritional businesses. The discovery of 
Zantac, a drug to treat stomach ulcers, catapulted the 
company into the mainstream pharmaceutical market 
and financed its expansion into the US market. As the 
patent for Zantac was about to expire, Glaxo found itself 
in a sticky situation. Up to that point the company had 
relied on internal R&D, but this had failed to develop the 
R&D capabilities for sustainable long-term growth. In 
1995, the company merged with Wellcome, a company 
known for its strength in R&D and its lack of marketing 
 capabilities. The merger was successful in that the new 
company now had a stream of new drugs that could be 
marketed using Glaxo’s expertise. 
 By 2000, Glaxo Wellcome was disappointing investors 
once again. Drug prospects, at least in the short term, 
were below the industry average and expected revenues 
from some of its products never materialized. Yet the 
merger with SmithKline Beecham was not driven by the 
same urgency as the previous merger. Both companies 
had a reasonably stable pipeline and a balanced portfolio 
of drugs. According to Sir Richard Sykes, then Chairman 
of Glaxo Wellcome, the deciphering of the human genome 
would transform the industry and only large companies 
that could afford to invest in working with this new infor-
mation would succeed. Together, these two companies are 
immune to the near-death experience of losing a major 
blockbuster drug. No one drug accounts for more than 
12 percent of the company’s revenues. 
 GSK operates in two product-based industry seg-
ments: (1) pharmaceuticals, which include prescription 
drugs and vaccines; and (2) consumer health care, 
which includes over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, 
oral care, and nutritional health care. Prescription 
drugs are sold mainly to wholesalers, which dispense 
them to the public through pharmacies. Consumer 
 health-care products are sold through pharmacies, 
wholesalers, or directly to retail outlets. In July 2009, 
it acquired Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. In October 2009, it 
acquired Pfizer Inc.’s HIV business and combined it 
with its own HIV business to form ViiV Healthcare 
Limited. In November 2009, it acquired the Algerian 
 pharmaceutical, manufacturing and distribution group, 
Laboratoire Pharmaceutique Algerien. In December 
2009, it acquired NovaMin Technology Inc. 
 The first step in the development of a drug is R&D. GSK 
spends $4 billion on R&D and has over 15,000 researchers 
in 24 R&D sites around the world. Once GSK has developed 
a new drug, it must obtain government approval in every 
individual nation where the company markets the product, 
a process that can differ significantly in each jurisdiction. 
Production and marketing are the next steps for a new 
drug. GSK’s supply chain is divided into a primary chain 
and a secondary chain. The primary chain manufactures 
active ingredients for its products and ships them to the 
secondary chain, which manufactures the end product. 
There are 13 primary supply-chain sites based in Australia, 
India, Ireland, Singapore, the United States, and the UK. 
In Europe, there are 17 secondary supply-chain sites, 
while North America houses an additional six. The rest of 
the world has 32 secondary sites in 19 countries (five in 
the Middle East and Africa, 22 in Asia–Pacific, and five in 
Latin America). 
 Different price regulations at a national level have 
created some market abnormalities in each region. For 
instance, Canadian Web-based pharmacies have sprung 
up to service US consumers seeking cheaper alternatives. 
GSK sent a heavily worded letter to Canadian wholesalers

that were selling to these pharmacies and threatened to 
stop supplies. In Spain, GSK developed a two-price sys-
tem: one lower price for products to be sold in Spain and a 
higher price for those to be exported to other EU member 
countries. The EU found this practice illegal.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 More than 100 nations in the world are not triad members; they lie 
outside North America, Europe, and Japan. An important subgroup 
of non-triad countries is the “emerging economies,” marked by 
their rapid economic growth and changing involvement in the 
global economy. They are increasingly important for MNEs of all 
sizes: as growing markets whose large populations are starting to 
have more and more disposable income; as increasingly important 
sources of inputs, including products, technology, and value-adding 
capabilities as well as commodities and cheap labor; and as a source 
of competition, as non-triad firms begin to internationalize into triad 
markets. These developments represent many new opportunities 
as well as new risks for MNEs. Increased involvement in emerging 
market regions for managers means coping with more diversity. 
This includes the broad cultural, political, and economic diversity 
resulting from the wide range of countries outside the triad. It also 
includes diversity of business practices and competitors, which MNEs 
need to adapt to in order to survive. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  the relative attractions, opportunities, and threats in 
the triad regions and emerging economies for firms looking to 
internationalize.  
 2  Explain  how many emerging economies are becoming more 
integrated into the global economy, in terms of trade, FDI, and 
other forms of interaction and interdependence.  
 3  Understand  the nature of the new multinationals from emerging 
economies, as collaborators and competitors.  
 4  Examine  the implications of changes in emerging economies 
for MNE managers in terms of new strategies and organization 
structures.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Acer Taiwan ranks as one of the largest PC companies 
in the world. The overall Acer Group of companies is 
comprised of 7,757 employees, plus dealers, and distribu-
tors in more than 100 countries, earning revenues of US 
$20.056 billion for the year 2010, of which 6.5 percent was 
generated from Taiwan, 24 percent from the United States, 
46.9 percent from Europe, and 22.6 percent from Asia. In 
just over five years (2006–2010), sales have almost doubled 
from $11.814 billion in 2006 to $20.056 billion in 2010. The 
company is one of the best-known brands in Asia, and a 
large player in Latin America. In the United States, where 
HP and Dell dominate, Acer is the third largest competitor 
in the consumer electronics market. According to Mintel 
Global Market Navigator, the laptop PCs’ market share by 
volume in the United States in 2009 was that HP held 25.9 
percent, Dell 21.5 percent, Acer 15.8 percent, Toshiba 9.7 
percent, and Apple 9.4 percent. Not bad for a company no 
one knew just a few decades ago. 
 In 1976 CEO Stan Shih and some of his friends man-
aged to pull together $25,000 and start Multitech. With 
seven employees, the company began developing small 
electronic products such as pocket calculators and 
games. Slowly the company began to grow by commer-
cializing microprocessor technology and its applications. 
Its initial entrance into the PC market was as a supplier. 
Multitech began producing computers to be sold under 
other brand names. Then in 1986 the company launched 
its own brand name computer, Acer, and it began to sell 
in Europe and in Japan. While the firm still supplies 
under other brand names, Acer has become one of the 
best-known PC brands in the world. 
 How did a small company from Taiwan gain market 
share in an industry dominated by well-established com-
puter manufacturers? Two key strategies underpinned its 
rapid international growth. First, it focused on learning: 
actively developing technological know-how, innovation 
capabilities, and, later, marketing and branding expertise. 
It invested in engineering training, initially with the help 
of the Taiwanese government. In the late 1970s it founded 
the Microprocessor Training Center where 3,000 engineers 
were trained for Taiwan’s information industry. It also 
entered into a range of subcontracting relationships and 
joint ventures with major multinational firms in targeted 
industries. One of the most prominent was its DRAM semi-
conductor joint venture with Texas Instruments in 1989. 
To acquire necessary technologies the company bought a 
host of firms including Counterpoint Computers, Altos, and 
Kangaroo Computer. It also entered into cross-licensing 
agreements with firms like IBM and Intel. Innovation was 
the constant focus. The rapid development of engineering, 
design, and R&D capabilities helped Acer improve both its 
production efficiency and its product development capabil-
ities. In 1986 it came out with a 32-bit PC model before IBM. 
In 1994 it introduced the world’s first dual Intel Pentium 
PC, in 2001 the first Chinese Palm OS, and in 2004 a 64-bit 
notebook PC. 
 Second, Acer followed an incremental, niche strategy 
in order to expand internationally. Stan Shih explains this 
decision by noting, “It is better to be a big fish in a small 
pond than a small fish in a big pond.” Small markets, es-
pecially in Asia, which were not yet captured by the likes of 
IBM and Compaq, were a driving force behind Acer’s initial 
international success. 
 Acer’s distribution system was also a novelty. With 
the product life of computer components at about three 
months, exporting overseas becomes a problem, but Acer 
built manufacturing and assembling plants all over the 
world. The company distributed parts with long product 
lives by ship, while highly volatile products like processors, 
PCBs, and memory were shipped by plane. This allowed for 
just-in-time production that Shih compared to the distribu-
tion system of a fast-food chain with perishable and non-
perishable ingredients. 
 The success of the company also owes much to the 
management structure created by Shih. Unlike traditional 
Chinese businesses, where management is highly hier-
archical and controlled by the owning family, Shih uses 
decentralized management. Autonomy is important. 
Managers are encouraged to think like owners, so as to 
take advantage of all profit opportunities. Additionally, Acer 
has gone public and employees have the option of buying 
shares at extremely low prices. 
 In 2000, Acer spun off its manufacturing operations 
to focus on globally marketing its brand name prod-
ucts: desktop and mobile PCs, servers and storage, dis-
plays, peripherals, and e-business solutions. This began 
a shift away from production and into design and branding 
(since 2004 it has produced a “Ferrari” line of notebook 
PCs), and service-related businesses, partly following 
the evolution of the industries mapped out by Stan Shih’s 
Smiling Curve in the early 1990s. He predicted that suc-
cess in the combined computing, IT, consumer electronics, 
and telecoms industries would increasingly depend on 
being customer-centric, with customer-driven rather than 
 ACTIVE LEARNING CASE

CHAPTER 20 EMERGING  ECONOMIES
technology-driven innovation. The firm would need to be 
committed to providing outstanding service and developing 
intellectual property such as software, rather than focus-
ing on hardware and production activities. 
 The retirement of Stan Shih in 2004 led to a significant 
organizational change at the firm, but it maintained its 
core strategy under J. T. Wang who has been Chairman of 
the Board and Chief Executive Officer in Acer Incorporated 
since April 20, 2011. A more devolved decision-making 
structure has evolved across a more international group 
of senior management, a process accelerated by a number 
of large acquisitions as well as disposals. Acer’s buy-
out of US-based Gateway in 2007 compares to Lenovo’s 
(successful) takeover of IBM’s PC business in 2004 and 
BenQ’s (unsuccessful) takeover of Siemens PC division 
more recently. This helped Acer move ahead of Chinese 
rival Lenovo by strengthening its position in the US retail 
market and giving it control of Packard Bell in Europe. 
But the competitive threat posed by mainland Chinese PC 
and electronics firms remains a key strategic challenge 
for Acer. In 2010 the firm established its second mainland 
China manufacturing base in Chongqing and is now calling 
this its “global IT center”.

 In  Chapter 15  we examined some of the country-level risks common in emerging market 
countries. Although these stand out because of their rapid growth rate, they share many of 
the same characteristics of non-triad countries in general. Such countries are: 
 ■   growing in importance for international managers for both market-seeking investments 
and resource-seeking investments; 
 ■   strongly government controlled, in that government agencies play a central role in 
negotiating with foreign investors and deciding the local rules of the game;  
 ■   less predictable and riskier than triad markets, which investors often underestimate in 
their pursuit of the high level of rewards on offer; 1 and 
 ■   the source of new competitors, as local firms move up the value chain, becoming more 
sophisticated and more international. 
 We are concerned with two broad kinds of international expansion in this chapter. First, 
internationalization from the triad into non-triad regions whereby established MNEs, 
whose home base is large, mature, and includes expensive markets, expand to sell more 
outputs in, or buy more inputs from, cheaper emerging economies. Second, the inter-
nationalization of newer MNEs from outside the triad which are looking both to comple-
ment home-market resources with assets or capabilities from inside the triad and to sell 
into the much larger triad countries. For each kind of MNE these two forms of interna-
tionalization represent some major strategic threats and opportunities.  
 INTRODUCTION

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Triad-based and non-triad-based ﬁ rms will have similar objectives when exploring market-
seeking investments. They both want to increase sales in each other’s territories and to do 
this they must customize products and services to suit these markets, establish (or buy) dis-
tribution and sales networks, and raise the proﬁ les of their brands. In many cases they may 
also need to set up manufacturing, assembly, service, or support activities in each other’s 
markets to avoid import duties and/or to support the needs of customers. 
 When exploring input-seeking investments, triad-based and non-triad-based firms may 
also have similar strategies, but they tend to be looking for different kinds of inputs. This 
is because their home regions provide each with a different set of factor endowments, as 
described by the Porter diamond model in  Chapter 10 . 
  Figure   20.1    provides a starting point to understand the attraction for triad firms looking to 
expand into emerging economies and for firms from emerging economies looking to expand 
into triad regions. The large markets of North America, Europe, and Japan still dominate the 
global economy, but they are growing slowly relative to emerging markets both large, like India, 
China, and Brazil, and small, like Poland or Malaysia. Triad regions also tend to be more expen-
sive, in terms of labor costs, infrastructure, land, materials, and supporting industries, relative 
to non-triad regions. These represent push factors, accentuating the pull of non-triad locations. 
Combining these differences means that there are strong incentives for triad-based firms both 
to sell products, services, and other outputs into these growing markets and to source inputs, 
such as cheap labor or manufactured components and services, from such places. 
 For new MNEs evolving in non-triad regions, the main attraction of triad markets is the 
large, mature markets. But many firms also look to these countries to fill gaps in their assets, 
resources, and capabilities, from technological know-how or specialist components to brands. 
 FDI into emerging economies for inputs (  resource-seeking FDI ) and outputs 
 ( market-seeking FDI  ) takes a variety of forms. Prudential (UK), along with many other 
triad firms, cut many of its back-office operations in Reading, England, in 2002 and estab-
lished a center in Mumbai, India. Although this resulted in around 400 redundancies in the 
UK, the firm was then able to take advantage of the cheaper (and, in some cases, better) 
local Indian IT and call-center service workers that have created the local industry reviewed

reviewed in the Real Case: The Indian IT, software, and services industry at the end of 
this chapter. The Active Learning Case: Kodak in China in Chapter 15 shows how Kodak 
created a series of mergers and joint ventures to invest over $1 billion into China, both for 
producing film products more cheaply (using cheaper labour and raw materials) and for 
serving the growing Chinese market before it filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Contrasting 
these, the Active Learning Case: Acer Taiwan goes international and the International 
Business Strategy in Action: Korean chaebols ­charting the growth and internationalization 
of Korean chaebols Hyundai and Samsung show why and how newer MNEs have broken 
into triad markets. Yet in many other cases, such as for Tesco in the case International 
Business Strategy in Action: From Oserian to Tesco, firms do not see a need to engage 
in FDI, because they can get access to the advantages of non-triad locations and maintain 
control over their supply chains by buying and selling through global markets.
More generic international business reasons also exist for expanding into these markets, 
including risk diversification, the opportunity to extend economies of scale and scope, 
and the opportunity to leverage existing assets or resources for additional revenues. For 
example, expanding global production by establishing manufacturing plants in non-triad 
regions serves to diversify risk by reducing dependence on triad locations where input 
costs and wages are high—but may also rise further. This allows firms to reap economies-
of-scale benefits across the overall production function. Similarly, extending established 
triad brands into new markets helps build the economies of scale needed to pay for media 
advertising and other brand-building activities. As sports stars and celebrities, such as 
Tiger Woods (for Nike), develop international reputations, their images can be used to sell 
products around the world, and companies can earn sufficient revenues to pay for them 
because they are assets that can be leveraged globally.

What was the internationalization strategy of Acer and why was it successful?
Rather than aiming to break into the triad markets directly, despite the attractions, Acer 
focused on building a presence in smaller local Asian markets first. In some ways it fol-
lowed a pattern of gradual, stepwise internationalization. Acer built up from its relatively 
small home-base diamond in Taiwan and expanded production throughout South-East 
Asia. It then undertook a double-diamond strategy for accessing the triad markets of 
North America and Europe. It formed strategic alliances with the US and European MNEs 
and used these as a stepping stone to FDI in these key triad markets. It also kept its 
production-based efficiencies of employee involvement in company growth and ongoing 
R&D to improve the quality of its products.
This growing interest between triad and non-triad regions is apparent in changing patterns of 
global FDI. As Table 20.1 shows, just under 60 percent of all FDI flows into developed countries, 
mainly the triad. This compares to 85 percent in 1980. Asia, and particularly South-East Asia, 
takes the major share of the remaining 37 percent going to developing countries, with 22 percent 
of the world total, compared to a share of just 1 percent in 1980 and 12 percent in 1990. Africa 
receives 5 percent. Overall, though, FDI is the largest source of external finance for all develop-
ing countries and on average now amounts to over one-third of their GDP, compared to just

CHAPTER 20 EMERGING  ECONOMIES
10 percent in 1980. As described below, patterns of inward FDI are varied, with some countries 
or regions showing signiﬁ cant growth while others experience no growth and even decline. 2  
 Given the market-seeking and resource-seeking aims of MNE investors, we can see that 
the varying levels of attractiveness of different non-triad investment destinations are the 
result of differences in market size and growth rates and the opportunities they present for 
firms looking for sourcing and production advantages. Opportunities for accessing these 
kinds of advantages can be enhanced by government   liberalization policies , which can 
help to reduce the limitations and constraints on foreign firms’ investments and business 
activities. Liberalization, for many governments in emerging economies, signals a move 
away from a centrally controlled or coordinated economy, toward a more free market 
economy. This shift is often accompanied by the widespread privatization of state-owned 
firms. Again this presents opportunities for MNEs, for example, in telecoms, utilities, or 
energy industries, to buy into newly privatized firms or establish joint ventures and alli-
ances to access resources or the local market. India provides a clear illustration of this with 
FDI inflows amounting to over $2 billion between 1991 and 1995, after liberalization, 
compared to well below $1 billion in the two decades leading up to 1990.  
  Non-triad countries and regions differ, both in their initial economic attractiveness to 
MNEs and in the ways that governments are liberalizing parts of the economy; together 
these explain many of the differences we observe in regional patterns of FDI.  Table   20.2    
shows that, in the same time period, outflows of FDI from developing countries have grown 
fairly dramatically. Again South-East Asia is responsible for the dominant share. China’s 
stock of outward FDI has grown from $2.5 billion in 1990 to over $25 billion in 2000, and 
over $60 billion in 2007. It has since grown at a staggering rate, to over $148 billion in 2008 
and over $245 billion in 2009. In addition to this, however, a significant proportion of the 
much larger outward flows from Hong Kong originally come from mainland China. 
 We will now briefly review the recent experience of each of the main non-triad regions 
in terms of inward FDI and look at some examples that provide insights into the drivers of 
FDI flows. In preparation for the discussion below about MNEs from emerging economies, 
we will also briefly look at some of the largest firms in these countries that are expanding 
within and beyond their regions. 
 Liberalization policies 
 Government policies that 
move away from planned 
economies toward more 
free market systems; 
they are marked by the 
privatization of state-owned 
businesses, a lowering 
of tariff and non-tariff 
barriers, and reductions in 
the constraints placed on 
foreign firms’ investments 
and business activities

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
  Asia–Pacific and the Middle East 
 As shown in  Table  20.1 , Asia–Paciﬁ c and the Middle East receive 23 percent of global FDI 
ﬂ ows in 2008, the most of any non-triad region. But FDI is highly concentrated, with 10 
out of the 55 economies in the region (for which reliable data are available) accounting for 
over 90 percent of FDI. China and Hong Kong (China) receive half of the total regional FDI, 
indicating their growing attractiveness to investors.  
 We focus on China in the next chapter, but there are examples of events and factors else-
where in the region that help explain these patterns of investment. Many of the countries in the 
region continue to liberalize their economies and privatize state-owned assets, both of which 
are attractive to MNEs. Cross-border M&A has grown steadily, as has the significance of intra-
regional M&A, as opposed to investments driven by triad-based firms. But a few large acqui-
sitions and divestments can make a big difference to individual country markets. Following 
significant growth of FDI into South Korea in the early to mid-2000s, 2006 saw a drop as both 
Wal-Mart and Carrefour divested from the country to focus on other Asian markets. 
 FDI into India has grown rapidly, particularly in 2008 when inflows FDI amounted to 
more than 6 times between 2005 (US$6,598 million) and 2008 (US$41,554 million). A grow-
ing economy, continued liberalization, and the attractiveness of evolving IT, software, and 
services industries (see Real Case: the Indian IT, software, and services industry) all provided 
momentum. GM and IBM increased their presence as did Wal-Mart, Toyota, and Nissan. 
 The oil-rich countries of Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, and Saudi Arabia also experienced 
recent upturns in inward FDI, almost exclusively related to their oil industries. Less political tur-
moil would clearly have resulted in larger inflows to the Middle East region in recent decades. 
 Finally, there are two clear trends that indicate the dynamism of the Asia region. First, 
the growth of   intra-regional investment   is particularly driven by the regional giants India 
and China joining countries like Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore as active 
investors, but also by the growth of Japanese investment in the region. Second, FDI in services 
is growing rapidly and now represents over 50 percent of FDI stock in the Asia region. 
Many of the high-growth economies are becoming increasingly service oriented and have 
developed efficient institutional and infrastructural conditions for attracting finance, 
telecoms, and commerce-related activities. In accordance with its commitments to the 
liberalization of services under its WTO accession agreement, China is opening its service 
industries to FDI. Restrictions on FDI in industries such as banking and finance, telecoms, 
logistics and distribution, transportation, and retail and wholesale trade are being removed.   
 MNEs from Asia–Pacific 
 The Asia–Paciﬁ c region has a large proportion of the 50 largest non-ﬁ nancial MNEs from 
developing countries listed by UNCTAD (see  Table   20.3   ). The largest number from any 
country come from Hong Kong (China). Top of the list is Hutchison Whampoa, a diversi-
ﬁ ed conglomerate which focuses on the Asia region. Other major ﬁ rms from the region 
include Petronas (oil and petroleum; Malaysia), Singtel (telecoms; Singapore), Samsung 
Electronics and LG Electronics (South Korea) and Jardine Matheson Holdings (diversiﬁ ed; 
Hong Kong). 
 Outward FDI from India has increased significantly in recent years. Indian companies 
undertake cross-border M&As to gain access to new technologies and expertise, and to build 
stronger positions in global markets. Steel industry takeovers have been hitting the headlines 
in recent years, with Mittal Steel’s takeover of European firm Arcelor for $32 billion rank-
ing as the world’s largest cross-border M&A transaction in 2006. In the same year, the Tata 
conglomerate acquired the Corus Group for $9.5 billion. It went on to buy Jaguar and Aston 
Martin from Ford in 2008, to add premium brands to its low-cost automotive portfolio. A 
further discussion about new multinationals from non-triad regions appears below.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
  Central and Eastern Europe 
 Despite years of political and economic change, including liberalization, in the Central 
and East European (CEE) region, it still attracts a relatively small percentage of global FDI 
inﬂ ows (see  Table   20.1   ). In 2008, FDI inﬂ ows to CEE increased to $114,361 million from 
$39,679 million in 2005.  
 Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary receive larger shares of FDI than other countries 
in the region but have experienced declines in recent years, as has the Russian Federation. 
These, plus five other CEE countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Slovakia), 
joined the EU in May 2004 and saw FDI inflows shrink, but things have improved since then. 
 Some countries are attracting auto sector FDI, including the Czech Republic, with 
an investment from Toyota–PSA, and Slovakia, with investments from PSA, Kia, and 
Hyundai. Volkswagen Slovakia is already that country’s largest company and biggest 
employer by far. Slovakia has a population of just over 5 million people, yet has developed 
into a leading producer of autos, nearing an output of 180 cars per 1,000 inhabitants, from 
having no auto industry whatsoever before 1991, when VW took over Skoda’s businesses 
in Bratislava in the Czech Republic. VW has invested around $1.3 billion in Slovakia, and 
Hyundai’s investments are expected to total $1.5 billion eventually. But in all these cases 
the MNEs were attracted to the region not just because of the combination of cheap labor, 
good infrastructure, and proximity to Europe’s large markets, but also because of the over 
$1 billion in subsidies and regional development loans they received to sweeten the deal. 3 
 In terms of outflows of FDI from the CEE region, the Russian Federation has dominated 
for some time as the major source. A key question for analysts is whether these capital flows 
represent genuine strategic investments in other parts of the world or capital flight from a 
politically tense Russia. 
  MNEs from Central and Eastern Europe 
 The largest MNEs in the CEE region are Russian, most of them nationally owned at one 
time or another and many of them based on the country’s abundant natural resources. The 
Russian oil and gas giants (Gazprom, Rosneft, and Lukoil) have started to expand abroad, 
including Gazprom’s investments in the German energy sector to get direct access to end-
users (also see the Real case study in  Chapter 15  on Yukos). Telecoms, aluminum, and other 
industries also feature in the international expansion of CEE ﬁ rms. 
  Latin America and the Caribbean 
 Only 8.5 percent of global FDI went to the Latin America region in 2008, the highest propor-
tion since 1980 and still slightly lower than inﬂ ows to China and Hong Kong (China) that 
year. Inward FDI has grown since then, but the percentage of global FDI going to this region 
has fallen. The three largest economies of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico have seen large 
ﬂ uctuations in inﬂ ows in the recent past. To various degrees these economies have had a 
difﬁ cult decade in terms of economic growth and recession. A spate of privatizations during 
the late 1990s gave a temporary boost to inward FDI for these and other regional economies 
and a number of MNEs increased their involvement in Latin America during this period. An 
example is Endesa, the Spanish-owned electricity utility, which is the leading supplier in six 
countries and serves 10.5 million customers (50 percent of its global market) in the region. 
Through its regional subsidiary Enersis, Endesa bought into or bought out national com-
panies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic to develop 
massive economies of scale in energy production, distribution, and services in the region. 4  
 Regional-level, as opposed to national-level, competition has evolved in other indus-
tries, sometimes pitting home-based MNEs against foreign-owned incomers. In telecoms, 
for example, Mexico’s America Movil and Spain’s Telefonica are battling it out for regional 
domination, both having boosted their holdings when US telecom firms went through a 

649
CHAPTER 20 EMERGING  ECONOMIES
divestment phase. Although the former dominates the Mexican mobile telephony busi-
ness, it has a long way to go to catch up with Telefonica. Telefonica Moviles, the Spanish 
firm’s regional mobile telecom subsidiary, has a presence in 13 countries in the region, is 
the market leader in 7 and second in 5, and serves a total of over 40 million customers. 5  
 Brazil and Mexico still receive the highest amounts of FDI and, as we would expect, 
one-third of all FDI into the region came from the United States. Many Latin American 
 countries now face increased competition for US manufacturing investment from China 
and the Asia region. This is particularly true of Mexico, whose linkage to the North 
American triad via NAFTA was discussed in  Chapter 10 , where the Mexico–US double 
diamond was explained. The mid-2000s saw a decline in the number of  maquiladora 
enterprises (which accounted for almost 50 percent of Mexico’s merchandise exports) and 
associated jobs losses. Combined with the decline in inward FDI, this called into question 
the attractiveness and competitiveness of the region in comparison to a fast-evolving Asia. 
  MNEs from Latin America 
 Of the 50 largest non-ﬁ nancial TNCs from developing countries listed by UNCTAD 
( Table   20.3   ), a relatively small number are from the Latin American region. As with the 
Central and East European MNEs (and contrasting those from the Asia–Paciﬁ c region) 
many of the largest are natural resources based. These include the largest of all, Cemex 
(construction materials; Mexico), Petroleos de Venezuela (Venezuela), Petrobras (Brazil), 
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (mining; Brazil), Metalurgica Gerdau (metal products; 
Brazil), and Perez Companc (oil and petroleum; Argentina). 
 Africa 
 As home to most of the world’s least developed countries (LDCs), Africa has always 
recorded low levels of inward FDI because of its relative lack of attractiveness to MNEs. 
Political instability, weak infrastructure, poor labor skills, and macroeconomic fragility have 
plagued many parts of the continent for decades. Except for the larger economies of Egypt 
and South Africa, and the oil producers such as Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Nigeria, and the 
Sudan, most of the remaining LDCs normally receive less than $200 million FDI per year. 
 As shown in  Table   20.1   , only 5 percent of total global FDI normally goes to Africa in 
2008, and this tends to be concentrated in resource-rich economies. Oil, diamonds, gold, 
and platinum in particular have been the main attraction for MNEs. Exxon Mobil, for 
example, has offshore oil projects in Nigeria, and the French firm Total Oil Nigeria has 
plans to invest $10 billion in the Nigerian oil industry. 6  For most of Sub-Saharan Africa, 
however, inflows are limited, although South Africa stands out as a major recipient due 
to its relatively healthy economy. Chinese investment into Africa, particularly targeting 
sources of raw materials and resources, is very much in the news. FDI worth an estimated 
$30–$40 billion, much of it from state-owned enterprises has flowed into Sub-Saharan 
Africa, but accurate data is not yet available.  
 FDI in telecoms and services recently overtook investment in mining and extraction in 
South Africa. At the same time it has extended its investments in other parts of the continent, 
with firms like BHP Billiton (mining) and Eskom (utilities) expanding into other African 
markets. Two of South Africa’s telecom firms are also majority shareholders in the largest 
mobile telecom firm in Africa, a joint venture between Telecom SA, VenFin, and Vodafone 
(35 percent stake) with over 10 million subscribers and almost $2.5 billion in revenues. It 
competes with MTN Group from South Africa, Orascom (Egypt), Orange (France Telecom), 
and CelTel International (the Netherlands), all of which are gradually taking market share 
from the fixed-line industry dominated by national telecom firms. In some industry sectors, 
despite the lack of inward FDI, there are growing business links between Western firms 
and local African firms. The Kenya cut flower industry is one example (see  International 
Business Strategy in Action: From Oserian to Tesco: the Kenyan cut flower industry ).  

650
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 From Oserian to Tesco: the Kenyan cut flower industry 
 Kenya is the leading exporter of cut flowers to Europe, with 
over 30 percent market share. Yet this industry has really 
grown only over the last 15 years, with export growth acceler-
ating rapidly in the late 1990s and achieving 27 percent growth 
between 2001 and 2005. How has this new-found global 
competitive advantage come about in one of the world’s least 
developed countries? The real start of the industry happened 
in 1994 with the formation of the Kenya Flower Council to sup-
port the operations of a number of fast-growing businesses. 
 Horticultural and cut flower exports provide well over 
US $1 billion to Kenya’s economy and flower exports alone 
earn over US $600 million. The country has about 7 percent 
of the global export market. Ecuador and Colombia are key 
competitors and the Netherlands still dominates with over 50 
percent. The major markets are Germany, the UK, and United 
States, but the major proportion of exports goes to the Dutch 
auction houses in Holland. Direct sales via supermarket chains, 
particularly in the UK, have increased dramatically, however. 
 The country’s flower industry employs about 70,000 people, 
and supports more than half a million people in Kenya. The 
average basic wage in the flower industry is around US 
$5,000 compared to Kenya’s average GDP per capita of US 
$800. Most of the flower growing is in the areas of Naivasha, 
Thika, and Kiambu, where over 2,000 hectares are used for 
flower production. Although over 30 varieties of flowers are 
grown in Kenya, roses make up two-thirds of Kenya’s flower 
exports, followed by carnations, statice, and alstromeria. 
  Local factor conditions 
 The successful cultivation of flowers requires the following 
elements: 
 ■   Good physical conditions: high light intensity, abundant 
water, clean soil, good climate  
 ■   Appropriate seeds and planting material  
 ■   Capital for investment and working capital  
 ■  Productive labor 
 ■   Expertise in growing techniques  
 ■   Good management and organization  
 ■   Pesticides and other chemicals  
 ■  Energy for heating 
 ■  Infrastructure 
 ■   A high level of quality consciousness all along the prod-
uction and post-harvesting chain   
 Perhaps more than any other internationally traded 
good, time-to-market is critical in the cut flower industry. 
Strict control of humidity, temperature, and air quality is 
essential for delivering an attractive product to the market. 
Growers rely heavily on the post-harvest chain of handlers, 
storage, and transport, and in the absence of a “cold chain” 
it is not possible for equatorial producers to sell to the 
main northern markets. 
 Air freight adds significantly to the total cost and makes 
up by far the largest component of overall cost to African 
producers. Air freight, marketing, handling in Europe, and 
packaging make up 50 percent of all costs for Kenyan 
growers. In the Netherlands, however, transport accounts 
for just 14 percent of the costs, but labor makes up 35 
percent of costs. 
 Although cheap labor and a good growing climate are 
advantageous for growing flowers, some countries have 
done well for some time without these local factor endow-
ments. The Netherlands does not have climatic, land, or 
labor advantages but has been a dominant player in the 
industry for a long time. This is partly due to the power of 
the Dutch auction houses, which have long overseen the 
international flower trade. 
 In Porter’s terminology (in the diamond model discussed 
in  Chapter 10 ) acquired factor conditions, such as the cold-
transport infrastructure, plant breeding and greenhouse 
technologies, and production management capabilities 
were required before Kenya could leverage its natural 
endowments and the cheap labor advantage to compete in 
the open market. It is only in the last 15  to 20 years that 
these acquired factors have developed. 
 In 2008 another “Diamond of Advantage” factor, the influ-
ence of government, loomed large when the Presidency of 
Mwai Kibaki faced a vote of no confidence by the people. 
Political instability took its toll on the flower companies, rais-
ing questions about the sustainability of an important industry. 
 The Oserian Development Company 
 Oserian (“place of peace” in Maasai), one of the largest 
privately owned flower farms in the world, was among 
the first commercial exporters of cut flowers from Kenya. 
Although it began growing flowers in the early 1980s the 
company dates from 1967 and was started and is still oper-
ated and partly owned by Hans and Peter Zwager. It has 
over 200 hectares under cultivation next to Lake Naivasha 
in the Rift Valley and exports over 300 million stems per 
year. These are mainly sold by East African Flowers (EAF) 

651
CHAPTER 20 EMERGING  ECONOMIES
BV, through the Teleflower Auction (TFA) in Holland, to 
other buyers around the world; or by World Flowers in 
the UK, direct to Tesco. Crops include roses, spray car-
nations, gypsophila, chrysanthemums, statice, hypericum, 
euphorbia, delphinium, and perezi. The farm employs about 
5,000 people; 85 percent are permanent employees and 
over 60 percent live on the farm with their families. The 
facilities include three kindergartens, two primary schools, 
a secondary school, shopping centers, social halls, and a 
medical center. 
  Industry structure: Tesco and the growing power of the 
supermarkets  
 Although the Dutch auction houses have traditionally been 
the focal point of the world flower industry, large retailers 
are building direct links with growers around the world, 
using their purchasing power to gain better control over 
product price, delivery, and quality. African producers appear 
to be the main beneficiaries of this change in purchasing 
habits. Supermarkets are interested in African flowers 
because they are inexpensive and because growers are 
willing to accept a set price. To the growers this arrange-
ment is attractive because supermarkets buy large quanti-
ties at prearranged prices. But in order to live up to their 
side of the bargain African growers must invest in optimal 
production methods. Often this includes investments in 
greenhouses, forced ventilation and heating, and, in all 
cases, greater attention to quality. 
 Over the past decade Kenya’s direct imports to the UK 
have grown, partly due to the establishment of direct 
links with Marks & Spencer and Tesco. The British spend 
more than $3 billion a year on fresh cut flowers and 
indoor plants; 85 percent of all flowers sold in the UK are 
imported, of which about 20 percent come from countries 
outside the EU. 
 Around one-quarter of roses sold in the UK are pur-
chased directly from Kenya, mainly by the major super-
markets. Tesco, one of the top three supermarket chains 
in the world, is the UK’s number one food retailer and 
the largest retailer of flowers and plants. Tesco has been 
selling houseplants and flowers for the last two decades 
and sales keep growing, hence the need for reliable ties 
with suppliers. Tesco became an associate member of 
the Kenya Flower Council in early 2000 as its direct links 
with suppliers like Oserian began to grow. By cutting out 
the Dutch auction houses, Tesco found that it could work 
directly with growers to reduce prices and improve quality 
and also pass on customer needs to more directly influ-
ence new developments. 
 Fairtrade 
 Tesco and Oserian deepened their buyer–supplier alliance 
by opening a line of Fairtrade roses. These are grown by 
Oserian and one other farm in Kenya (Finlay Flowers in 
Kericho), which have been certified to comply with employ-
ment, social, and environmental conditions laid down in the 
Fairtrade agreement. 
 The agreement was set up in response to concerns 
among customers and expressed in the media about the 
conditions under which flowers are grown. This included 
the employment conditions of workers and the environ-
mental effects on the land and particularly water avail-
ability, around, for example, Lake Naivasha. Although 
Fairtrade roses are slightly more expensive, they repre-
sent a differentiated product designed to appeal to ethically 
minded customers. Tesco does not take an additional profit 
as 8 percent of the overall export price goes directly to the 
farms, allocated by joint management and employee com-
mittees, to improve employee conditions. This premium is 
worth up to US $200,000 per year to the two farms involved. 
This concern for social ethics has strengthened as Oserian 
became part of the Mavuno Group in 2010 and expanded its 
direct sales to more global markets.

 MNEs from Africa 
 Just 5 of the 50 largest non-ﬁ nancial TNCs from developing countries listed by UNCTAD 
( Table   20.3   ) are from Africa, and they are all South African. Sasol (industrial chemicals), 
Gold Fields (metal products), Naspers (consumer services), Steinhoff (consumer services) 
and Sappi (paper products), are major players in their respective sectors throughout the 
region. At least part of the explanation for the lack of large indigenous ﬁ rms from other 
African countries lies in their colonial past and the history of domination by Western mul-
tinationals as investors in local mineral or agricultural resources. 7 

652
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Newly industrialized 
countries (NICs) 
  A subgroup of emerging 
market economies that 
has experienced rapid 
economic growth, normally 
accompanied by political 
and social change; the 
forerunners were the four 
Asian “Tiger” economies: 
Singapore, South Korea, 
Taiwan, and Hong Kong. 
The rapid growth, increased 
trade and FDI, and 
integration of China in the 
global economy show that it 
is approaching this status 
 Theory of absolute 
advantage 
  Nations should specialize in 
particular industries where 
they have a particular 
advantage and trade to gain 
other goods and services; 
all countries benefit so 
long as protectionism is 
minimized 
 As we have seen from the breakdown of FDI flows above, FDI into non-triad regions 
tends to be concentrated in a few countries within each region. Moreover, although 
FDI still tends to be related to primary resources, such as oil, minerals, and agricultural 
commodities in many of these countries, there is a growing volume of manufacturing 
and service-related FDI. This is particularly true for a group of emerging markets or 
 newly industrialized countries (NICs)  , which have broken the cycle of underdevelop-
ment to achieve economic growth and wealth creation, partly through increased inte-
gration with other parts of the global economy. This group includes relatively wealthy 
countries like South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan (China), which 
were together called the “four Asian Tigers” in the 1980s when they began to achieve 
high rates of economic growth. But there are also other growing economies, particu-
larly in the Asia–Pacific region, that appear to be moving along the same growth path. 
Why are these economies growing? How are they able to compete with triad firms, 
export, and sell in triad markets? Why are they attractive as locations for triad FDI? 
These are important questions as the emergence of these economies, particularly the 
two giant markets of China and India, is giving rise to some of the most important 
competitive opportunities and threats for MNEs of all types.  
 To understand current patterns of growth in many emerging markets we need to briefly 
review some of the theoretical explanations for the evolving patterns of national-level com-
parative and competitive advantage (we did this in  Chapter 6  and some of the following 
summarizes our earlier description). In the original landmark study of wealth creation and 
national competitiveness, the economist Adam Smith stated: 
 What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of 
a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we 
ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own 
industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage. The general industry of 
the country, being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby 
be diminished . . . but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the 
greatest advantage. 8 
 Adam Smith’s   theory of absolute advantage   suggested that each nation should 
 specialize  in producing goods it had a  natural  or  acquired  advantage in producing (and 
therefore could produce more efficiently than other countries). Exports of these goods 
would pay for the import of goods that other countries produced more efficiently. There 
were therefore  net gains from trade for all countries involved. Smith also became famous 
for his analysis of specialization and competitive advantage at the firm level.  
 Over time Smith’s views were extended, for example, by David Ricardo’s theory of compara-
tive advantage. A notable shift toward looking at sources of competitive advantage and regional 
variations in these to explain global patterns of competitiveness came in the early 1900s. Two 
Swedes—Eli Heckscher (in 1919) and Bertil Ohlin (in 1933)—are responsible for developing a 
basic model that was further refined by the American economist Paul Samuelson. The H–O or 
HOS model (or theory of factor endowments) takes us beyond the simple assumptions made 
by Ricardo about labor productivity to look at the  relative availability  of different factors of 
production (primarily land, labor, and capital) and therefore their  relative price (rent, wages, 
and interest) in each country. These will determine the products in which a country has a com-
parative advantage, and in which it will therefore tend to specialize and trade. 9  
 The HOS model maps out the initial conditions for regional specialization in capital-
intensive or labor-intensive industries according to local factor advantages but is also a 
dynamic model, showing how economic conditions change as countries interact through

AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

trade. These theories underpin the Porter diamond model (see  Chapter 10 ). They are also 
incorporated into the interestingly named  Flying Geese model   by Japanese academic 
Kaname Akamatsu. 10  
 Flying Geese model 
 The Flying Geese model ( Figure   20.2   ) suggests that Asian economies are following similar 
development paths, but are at different stages along this path, following the lead “goose,” Japan. 
Over time each country, or group, will gain and then subsequently lose speciﬁ c comparative 
advantage in a particular industry. Japan has shifted from iron and steel to textiles to clothing 
to autos to electronics. The four Tiger economies—Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, 
and Taiwan—followed a similar trajectory, although quicker. Other ASEAN (Association 
of South-East Asian Nations) members such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and 
Thailand are a little further behind, but the sequence of specialization is similar. In each 
country the transition is marked by a shift of employment from one sector to another, 
within the broader move from agriculture to manufacturing and then to services. Overall, 
rising skills and improved technological capabilities, increased capital investment, and wage 
inﬂ ation (as predicted by the HOS model) drive, and are driven by, the change process. 
 If we look at a particular industry, the location of production activities and subse-
quent exports and trade flows change as different economies change their specializ-
ation ( Figure   20.3   ). China now dominates as the world’s biggest exporter of textiles and

we should expect to see 
these industries located in 
different Asian countries, 
depending on their 
resource endowments, 
labor costs, and capabilities

clothing, Korea has a thriving automobile sector, and Singapore and Taiwan have very 
successful electronics industries. These have grown to the point that Japan, now a net 
importer of televisions, is losing its lead in many product areas ( Figure   20.4   ). The overall 
pattern of change is also in line with Vernon’s international product life cycle theory 
described in  Chapter 6 . 11  
 The timescale over which individual countries develop the economic conditions, 
resources, and capabilities to specialize in a particular industry sector appears to be short-
ening. Comparative advantage between nations is also therefore shifting faster than in the 
past ( Figure   20.5   ). It took Toyota and Sony 30 to 35 years to evolve into leading firms in 
their industries, whereas Samsung (South Korea) and Acer (Taiwan) took 20 to 25 years. 
Firms like WIPRO, InfoSys, and TCS, which are lead firms in the Indian software industry, 
have achieved superior competitive positions (albeit in niche areas of customized software 
and IT services) in 15 to 20 years.

CHAPTER 20 EMERGING  ECONOMIES
 The Flying Geese model is far from perfect and has been widely criticized on a number of 
counts. Many studies note that the sequential transfer of industrial specialization does not fol-
low the same pattern in each country, or that it tends to be more of a parallel process whereby 
emerging economies seem to develop capabilities and grow exports across several industries 
at the same time. 12  The example of the Indian IT and services industry (see Real Case) also 
demonstrates that leapfrogging is possible. Here an LDC has evolved competitive advantages 
in an advanced service sector without going through the stages depicted by the model. 
 For the most critical observers, the model is associated with a desire by Japan to see itself 
as the lead “goose” in the region from a political and perhaps military perspective (particu-
larly given that its origins date back to the 1930s), as opposed to a useful representation of 
patterns of economic transformation. 
 There are, however, some insights we can gain into the processes affecting the chang-
ing global locations of different industries and business activities and into the changing 
relative competitive advantages between countries. With this in mind we need to think 
about the future for China—the evolving specializations of Chinese firms and the result-
ing competitive threats for other firms. China represents a powerful combination of cheap 
and well- educated labor, good infrastructure, a growing domestic market, and massive 
inflows of capital and technology from abroad. These are driving the rapid development of 
comparative and competitive advantage in a range of industries, including clothing, autos, 
white goods, and electronics. What we may be seeing is parallel development across these 
sectors, rather than sequential, stage-wise development following the lead goose (as shown 
in  Figure  20.5 ). This theme is taken up in  Chapter 20 .    
  Emerging economies as sources of innovation 
 A natural extension to the above theories on comparative and competitive advantage is 
to examine innovation as a relative (and sustainable) source of advantage at the national, 
industry, and ﬁ rm level. Traditional theories about the MNE tended to view the triad as 
a source of innovation and non-triad regions as recipients in a simple outward diffusion 
model. But other studies, which go beyond the Flying Geese model, have shown how ﬁ rms 
that develop the independent capacity to innovate, continually upgrading their FSAs and

How are changes in the Asian regional economy, in terms of both growing 
markets and growing competitors, affecting Acer and should the firm cope? 
 Among a range of threats and opportunities China looms large in both respects. Acer has 
taken a step in the right direction by moving away from manufacturing, where Chinese 
firms have natural advantages, and into customer-oriented design, development, and 
services. Acer’s advantages also lie in its global distribution and marketing and its brand. 
These are firm-specific advantages (FSAs), which Lenovo and other Chinese firms will 
take some time to develop. The evolving political relationship between Taiwan and main-
land China or the People’s Republic of China is also an important factor, influencing some 
of the strategic options open to firms like Acer. But other parts of Asia, including Japan, 
are changing and the firm could do well to develop an international strategy that focused 
more on the regional than the global.   

656
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
reducing their reliance on location-speciﬁ c endowments (CSAs), such as cheap labor, can 
achieve more sustainable competitive advantages. 13  
 Specific combinations of country-specific advantages (CSAs) and firm-specific advan-
tages (FSAs) explain Japan’s competitive advantage in auto exports, Taiwan’s semiconduc-
tor industry, and Indian IT and software businesses, for example (see also  Figure   20.6   ). 
Local conditions (the CSAs) also “breed” certain organizational forms, assets, capabilities, 
or expertise (FSAs) that turn out to be relative strengths in other markets. Honda’s orig-
inal export success in the United States came from its ability to make smaller, fuel-efficient 
autos, which it was forced to do to succeed in the domestic Japanese market during the 
postwar period. Porter cites demanding customers, industry rivalry, and efficient and effec-
tive supply chains (the  keiretsu  structures described in  Chapter 18 ) as key local drivers of 
the innovative capabilities of Japanese auto firms. 14  Both product and process innovation 
tend to be important. Continuously learning how to produce better (cheaper, more desir-
able) products and services in better (cheaper, more efficient, faster) ways is the key. But 
the dual effects of CSAs and FSAs that lead to international competitiveness can arise by 
chance as well as by design, and usually result from an unanticipated combination of both. 
 As the Real Case on the Indian software industry below shows, and the Oserian case 
study looking at the Kenyan cut flower industry also shows above, firms in developing and 
emerging economies have an increasing range of opportunities to exploit local endow-
ments and develop new competitive advantages. However, the openness of the global 
economy means that local players have to compete with MNEs which are also looking to 
exploit specific CSAs and often have equal access. 
 The Brazilian biofuels industry, for example, has evolved since the 1970s because 
petroleum has traditionally been expensive and sugar cane cheap and available. 
Following the government’s Proálcool program of incentives, the country gets more than 
30 percent of its automobile fuels from sugar cane-based ethanol (mainly from bagasse 
which is cane waste); 85 percent of new cars there can run on biofuels. In a world where 
governments, consumers, and companies aim to move toward more environmentally-
friendly sources of energy, Brazil has emerged as a leader in agricultural processing and 
automotive technologies related to ethanol-based fuels. However, in contrast to India’s 
IT sector, or China’s white goods industry, the few, small-scale automotive producers in 
Brazil appear to have lost out to the multinationals, failing to exploit their own country’s 
head-start in ethanol fuel technologies. GM is seizing the opportunity by establishing a

number of joint ventures in Brazil to co-develop better automotive technology in this 
field. It is gaining a lead in duel-fuel systems and all of its cars produced in Brazil are 
“FlexFuel” vehicles. Rather than attracted by low costs, GM’s choice of location for its 
R&D was driven by the need to access the best capabilities available globally. 15  
 International studies, including the World Competitiveness Report, use science and 
technology indicators, such as patenting output, to assess and compare the growing 
innovative capacity of different countries in different industries and technologies. In 
recent years Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, Chile and the Czech Republic have all 
ranked well as up-and-coming innovators. 16  The development of world-class univers-
ities and other attributes of advanced national science and technology infrastructures (or 
“national innovation systems”) has made some emerging economies attractive to R&D 
FDI from MNEs. China ranks third as a preferred location for foreign R&D investment, 
after the United States and the UK, while India, Singapore, and Brazil are all in the top 
20. 17  Microsoft, Siemens, and Philips have invested heavily into the Republic of Korea, for 
example, because of the available range of expertise in high-technology fields. Microsoft’s 
Mobile Innovation Lab develops wireless technologies and software for mobile devices. 
Siemens bought into Dasan Networks and develops communications and information 
systems technology for its global markets. Following acquisitions of parts of the LG Group, 
Philips has developed an R&D center focused on TV technology. This influx of high-
technology investment further adds to the importance of emerging economies as sources 
of, rather than passive recipients of, innovation.   
 For non-triad ﬁ rms the triad regions encompass by far the largest, wealthiest, and most 
sophisticated markets in the world. Access can be subject to complex arrangements with 
varying degrees of economic trade liberalization and protectionism that are inherent in 
the institutional and political structures of these regions. The triad represents both glo-
balization and sovereignty dimensions. The EU is the most politically integrated, in terms 
of institutional structures, and the Japanese-based bloc is the least. NAFTA is a free trade 
agreement, not a common market, but NAFTA contains provisions for the accession of 
Latin American and Caribbean and Central American nations, and it may then evolve into 
stronger political linkages like the EU model. 
 To develop global industries, non-triad nations need both trade and investment from 
the triad nations and also access to the markets of at least one of the triads. This implies 
that the focus of business strategy for firms in a smaller, non-triad nation should be to 
secure inward triad investment and market access for exports to a triad bloc. This can be 
done by direct business contact of a double-diamond type, but it is helped and reinforced 
by formal linkages arranged by the governments. As demonstrated in the previous chapter, 
both Canada and Mexico have already gone this route. 
 In  Chapter 2  we identified “clusters” of nations that are making such arrangements with 
triad blocs. In general, NAFTA is the basis for a trading bloc of the Americas; the EU is the 
locus for East European and African nations; Japan is the hub for many Asian businesses. 
Some smaller, non-triad nations may attempt to open the doors to two triad markets. For 
example, both South Korea and Taiwan have equal trade and investment with the United 
States and Japan. Firms from these countries need two double diamonds. (See  International 
Business Strategy in Action: Korean  chaebols:  Hyundai and Samsung ). Australia still has 
a large amount of trade with the UK and the EU, but its trade with Japan and other Asian 
nations is increasing rapidly. Indeed, the geographical basis of the triad serves to reinforce 
the dependence of neighboring nations on their dominant regional economic partner.  
 MARKET ACCESS TO THE TRIAD

 Korean chaebols: Hyundai and Samsung 
 Between 1970 and 2000, South Korea’s GDP grew by 750 per-
cent. Industrial production increased at an even higher rate 
and grew to account for over 95 percent of GDP in 2004. 
GDP per capita grew from $100 in 1963 to $10,000 in 1995 
and over $25,000 today. The so-called “Miracle on the Han 
River” has made the country the 12th largest in the world 
in terms of GDP, and it continues to grow faster than most 
advanced economies. 
 In South Korea’s transition to industrialization, a tran-
sition that many other poor countries have tried to make 
with little success,  chaebols  played a major role. South 
Korea still maintains a healthy rate of growth, although 
it is not as rapid as in the boom years, particularly since 
the Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998. This also marked 
a turning point in the role of the  chaebols , whose opaque, 
interdependent structures and cross-shareholdings are 
increasingly being questioned by South Koreans them-
selves, as well as by outsiders. 
 According to Global Fortune 500, 2011 ranking, the five 
largest  chaebols  are Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, 
SK Holdings, POSCO, and LG Electronics. Across the world, 
these companies have become household names produc-
ing everything from ships to autos to electronics. During the 
1960s,  chaebols  prospered under a government- fostered 
development plan. When Park Chung Hee became South 
Korea’s president after a military  coup d’état , he instituted 
an import-substitution strategy that favored large local 
producers and provided them with cheap credit, tax breaks, 
and other benefits. After Park Chung Hee’s death, low-
interest loans continued to be made available to  chaebols 
because of ties with banks. Since banks could not let a 
borrower the size of  chaebols  fail, credit was made avail-
able regardless of profitability, depriving the non- chaebol 
business sector from much needed credit. 
 In the 1990s, the  chaebols  took on debt to finance large 
expansion projects. The Asian financial crisis in 1997–1998 
reduced their revenues to such an extent that these com-
panies could no longer pay their creditors. For a long time, 
 chaebols  managed to conceal their troubles by providing 
member companies with intra-conglomerate loans. In 
addition, foreign and domestic investors became increas-
ingly aware of murky financial reporting practices. By the 
end of the crisis, Daewoo had become bankrupt. 
 In 1997, the IMF was called to bail out the South Korean 
economy after an unprecedented drop on the Korean won 
created a debt crisis. As part of the bailout, South Korea 
was to restructure its  chaebols . Debt-to-equity ratios 
had to be reduced. Financial reporting had to become 
transparent. Most importantly, non-core businesses were 
to be spun off. To oversee the transformation of the 
 chaebols  and, in turn, the Korean economy, the Financial 
Supervisory Commission (FSC) was established in 1998. 
Although  chaebols  have reduced their debt-to-equity ratios, 
unreliable financial reporting continues to occur. Most 
importantly, many  chaebols  continue to resist selling off 
their non-core businesses. 
 Hyundai Automotive and Samsung Electronics are two 
of the most successful and international firms from South 
Korea, but they have taken different development paths to 
get where they are. 
 Chaebols  had their origins in the vision of individuals. In 
1946 Chung Ju Yung, who worked as a delivery boy for a 
rice mill in the 1930s, purchased an auto repair shop that 
was the early foundation of the Hyundai group. In 1947 
Hyundai Engineering and Construction was established to 
take advantage of reconstruction contracts at the end of 
World War II. By 1976, Hyundai brought its country into the 
auto business with the introduction of the Pony. 
 Hyundai Automotive spun off from 
its conglomerate parent and merged 
with Kia to form one vehicle com-
pany, now the fifth largest in the 
world in terms of unit sales. In recent 
years it has experienced significant 
increases in overseas sales, par-
ticularly in the United States and 
Europe. As an indication of its stand-
ing Hyundai won top place as the 
most reliable car manufacturer in an 
influential consumer survey in the 
United States, joining Japanese car 
manufacturers in the top spots for

the first time. It has also made significant inroads into the 
Chinese market, particularly in 2008 with its joint-venture 
partner Beijing Automotive. In 2010, Hyundai Motor’s rev-
enues were US $97 billion, representing an impressive 
growth of 1.47 times from US $67 billion in 2006. In 2010, 
Hyundai Automotive generated 49.3 percent of its revenue 
from Korea, 14.8 percent from Asia, 21.8 percent from 
North America, and 14.1 percent from Europe. Hyundai 
Automotive is a home-region MNE. 
 In 1938, Byung-Chul Lee founded Samsung and began 
exporting food to China, and not long after that he opened 
a light manufacturing business. The 1970s saw Samsung 
enter into the chemical and heavy manufacturing indus-
tries. In the 1980s, the company entered the aerospace and 
telecommunications industry. During this decade, Samsung 
also became a major world supplier of semiconductors. 
 Samsung Electronics is one of the largest and most 
profitable South Korean companies, with sales of $106 bil-
lion in 2007 and $134 billion in 2010. Samsung Electronics 
generates 16.7 percent of its total sales from Korea, 
15.7 per cent from China, 16.1 percent from Asia (total 
48.5 percent from Asia), 28.1 percent from America, 
and 23.4 percent from Europe. Although it ranks with 
Panasonic and Hewlett-Packard amongst the top three 
global firms in electrical appliances and electronics, it 
is now the largest electronics firm in the world by some 
accounts. The 1997 Asian crisis forced Samsung to switch 
its focus from cheap consumer electronics to the top end 
of the market. The firm sold over 100 non-core businesses 
and let go 30 percent of its employees, a significant step 
in a country with traditionally militant trade unions. The 
refocusing on R&D, design, and marketing has since paid 
off. Driven by its four design centers in London, Tokyo, San 
Francisco, and Seoul, Samsung won more prizes from the 
Industrial Design Society of America in 2005 than any other 
firm. It was world number two in mobile phones, number 
one in DRAM memory chips, flash memory chips, hard 
drives, and TFT-LCDs. Key innovative products include 
LED-backlit LCD TVs, Galaxy S mobile phones and the 
Galaxy tablet which rivals the iPad. 
 Contrasting the route taken by Hyundai Automotive, 
Samsung Electronics is still part of the Samsung  chae-
bol , the largest in South Korea, with businesses ranging 
from shipbuilding, engineering, and chemicals to financial 
ser vices, hotels, and a theme park. The conglomerate is 
nearly four times larger than its nearest rivals LG and SK 
and accounts for about one-third of the country’s stock 
market capitalization. The group is controlled through a 
complicated web of shareholdings that bind its 27 sub-
sidiaries, although over 60 percent of Samsung Electronics 
shares are in the hands of foreign investors. 
 This opaque structure still worries minority shareholders, 
who have seen their returns eroded from the widespread 
 chaebol  practice of using profitable businesses to subsidize 
weaker affiliates and fund risky expansion. Samsung would 
arguably be in an even stronger position today had it not 
been called upon to bail the group out of a failed foray into 
the auto sector in the late 1990s, among other ill-advised 
diversifications.

 Later in this chapter we take a look at the Indian software and IT services industry. 
Within this industry there are small but significant examples of how success in one par-
ticular niche market can support triad access for firms in unrelated sectors. In March 2000 
the UK’s Tetley Tea Group was acquired by Tata Tea Limited. Coming more than 50 years 
after the end of 200 years of British colonial rule that had supported British-owned tea 
estates in India, this shift of power is an appropriate symbol for the twenty-first century. 
But the takeover was only made possible because of the financial success of Tata’s IT div-
ision, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Both are part of the Tata Group, one of India’s 
biggest publicly quoted conglomerates. Tata Tea was originally a tea estates company and is 
now India’s second most popular tea brand with a 21 percent share of the Indian branded 
teas market, 54 tea estates, and 59,000 employees. Senior management at Tata Tea said: 
 We wanted to create a global brand, because the marketplace was global and in a global market-
place only global brands survive, local players get marginalized. We did not want to get marginal-
ized, so we had to either build a global brand or acquire one. 

660
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 TCS is “Asia’s largest global software and services company” (according to its own PR), 
whose revenues have doubled every two years over the past six years. TCS is the “jewel in the 
crown” of the Tata conglomerate, making net profits of over $489 million in the year of the 
Tetley acquisition. Over 90 percent of these revenues come from the firm’s software exports, 
which are double those of its nearest domestic rival. TCS has 11,000 professionals in 50 countries 
and sells customized software, systems, consultancy services, and, increasingly, e-business 
products and services to a wide range of businesses partly through alliances with Western 
giants like Microsoft, IBM, and Netscape. The revenues and enhanced market capitalization 
gained from the software side provided the financial leverage to move up the value chain in 
the tea industry, taking over a major Western brand to enter into the UK market. This could 
be described as a case of “reverse colonization” and there are many more like it to come. 18

Why did Acer form strategic alliances with IBM and Texas Instruments? 
 Acer was not familiar with the North American market and was a new kid on the computer 
block. So it formed strategic alliances, whenever possible, with the dominant US MNEs. 
In doing so, Acer learned about the US triad market and how to distribute its products 
there. It also gained new technological capabilities for both process (manufacturing) inno-
vation and product design and development. Acer was then able to move ahead of these 
once-dominant US firms once it combined its efficiency in production with its new market 
knowledge of the rich North American customers.      
 1   Emerging economies are increasingly important for MNEs: as growing markets; as 
sources of cheaper or better production inputs; and as a source of competitors in the 
shape of new MNEs as non-triad firms internationalize.  
 2   Emerging economies tend to be controlled more strongly by their governments and are 
less predictable and riskier than triad markets.  
 3   Emerging market countries need investment from, and access to, a triad bloc in order 
to develop global industries. Inflows and outflows of global FDI show that there is 
growing integration between countries inside and outside the triad.  
 4   Current trends such as privatization, liberalization, and legislative changes that are 
designed to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) are helping emerging economies 
to tap their economic potential. Intra- and inter-regional trade agreements can also be 
helpful in creating both mini common markets and smoothing international trade.  
 5   FDI into Asia is concentrated in 10 fast-growing economies. There is strong intra-
regional trade and FDI growth and a marked increase in the importance of service 
industries; 36 out of the 50 largest non-financial TNCs from developing countries are 
from the Asia–Pacific region. 
 6   Despite years of liberalization the Central and East European region attracts relatively small 
amounts of FDI. Better prospects appear to be ahead for countries that have joined the EU.  
 7   Latin America and the Caribbean region receive a small percentage of global FDI (less 
than China). Intra-regional competition is strong but manufacturing exporters are los-
ing out to China.  
 KEY POINTS 

661
CHAPTER 20 EMERGING  ECONOMIES
 8   Africa receives less than 4 percent of global FDI and remains relatively unattractive 
and risky for most investors. South African MNEs are expanding across the region in 
particular industry sectors. 
 9   The newly industrialized countries (NICs), a subgroup of non-triad economies, have 
experienced rapid economic growth and increased trade and FDI, partly by specializing 
in particular industries and developing comparative and competitive advantages.  
 10  NICs and other emerging markets in Asia are seen by some to be following the Flying

 REAL CASE 
 The Indian IT, software, and services industry 
 With an average per capita GDP of $1,200 (around $3,500 
(2010 est.) in PPP terms), India is a less developed country 
(LDC). It has low literacy rates and high infant mortality 
rates. There are just five phones and two Internet users 
for every 100 people. Yet it also boasts one of the fastest-
growing knowledge-based industries in the world.

 Figure 20.7  The growth of India’s IT industry 
 Source:  NASSCOM Report,  http://www.nasscom.in/ . 
 The Indian IT software and services industry has out-
stripped all other industries, becoming the largest industry 
in India in terms of market capitalization. During the late 
1990s it grew by an average of 50 percent year on year. It 
is increasingly important to overall GDP and, more signifi-
cantly, as a contributor to India’s exports. Almost 1 million 
software professionals and a further 5 million people 
directly and indirectly are employed by the Indian software 
industry. India controls around 20 percent of the global 
customized software market, specializing in high-quality 
solutions and IT services for corporate customers in the 
banking, finance, and insurance sectors. It is not currently 
a player in the market for off-the-shelf, packaged software, 
which is dominated by US firms. 
 As we know, exports provide a clear indicator of global 
competitive advantage. Indian software industry exports 
have grown from under $5 million in 1980 to $700 million 
in 1996, $6 billion in 2000, $12 billion in 2004, over $30 bil-
lion in 2007 and over $47 billion in 2010 (see  Figure   20.7   ). 
The top firm, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a division of 
the Tata conglomerate, exported over $4 billion worth of 
IT software and services (with 186,914 employees and rev-
enue of $8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2011). The 
number two firm, InfoSys Technologies, managed 133,560 
employees and revenue of US$6 billion for the year ended 
March 31, 2011. 
 However, the sources of advantage underpinning the 
growth rate and success of the Indian IT industry are not 
explained by many of the standard international business 
frameworks, such as the Porter diamond model. Few, if 
any, of the factors that led to the genesis of the industry 
were initially present in India. There was no local demand; 
related and supporting industries, such as telecoms and 
computing, were highly underdeveloped; the national com-
munications infrastructure was among the worst in the 
world; and the main factor of production, the skills and 
knowledge of software programmers and IT business 
managers (an acquired factor endowment), was initially 
not home-grown. 
 The industry began with Indians returning from higher 
education, IT training, and often work experience in the 
United States and Europe. Many of the industry founders, 
such as Wipro Chairman Azim Premji, Ramalinga Raju 
of Satyam, and S. Ramadorai of TCS, were educated at 
US universities (although others, such as F. C. Kohli of 
TCS and InfoSys Chairman Narayana Murthi were not). 
They noticed the rising demand for customized software 
programmers and IT expertise in the banking, insurance, 
financial services, and other industries in the West and 
saw India as a potential low-cost provider of this expertise. 
They returned to India and built firms to meet the software 
needs of the triad, primarily the United States. 
 Factors that were on their side were the English lan-
guage skills of the Indians, as this is the main software 
programming language; the time difference that allowed 
a 24-hour software development project cycle; new global 
information and communications network infrastructures; 
fears over the Y2K or year 2000 problem; and the low cost 
of labor. “Body shopping,” the contracting of Indian pro-
grammers and their physical relocation to work with cli-
ents abroad, accounted for 90 percent of industry revenues 
in 1989. The average cost of a software programmer in 
India in the late 1990s was still about one-twelfth the cost 
of a US or European programmer. But wage rates were 

663
CHAPTER 20 EMERGING  ECONOMIES
relatively much lower in the early stages of the industry’s 
growth cycle and increased at around 25 percent per year 
from the mid-1990s. The cost of a programmer in China or 
Russia is now around 20 percent lower than in India, and 
the same lack of barriers to entry will help firms based in 
these countries to mount a new competitive threat.  
 As the industry evolved, government support, particu-
larly the development of software technology parks (the 
STPI network), the promotion of technical training, and 
subsidies to ICT infrastructure, became important. Also 
significant were the activities of US and European multi-
nationals. Initially Western firms subcontracted program-
ming and other tasks to Indian firms to exploit the cheap 
labor advantage. Many, like Texas Instruments, Microsoft, 
and Computer Associates, made substantial investments 
to build local operations to work within the emerging 
industry clusters in Bangalore and Madras. These global 
firms promoted innovation both as customers and as 
suppliers to local firms. They transferred hardware and 
software technology and assisted in the development 
of local technological capabilities through technical and 
management training, investment in R&D, new product 
and services development, and joint ventures. They also 
prompted and sometimes assisted in the development of 
local ICT infrastructure. 
 Perhaps the most important factor underlying the con-
tinued success of the industry is its evolution from an 
industry based on cheap labor and low costs to one based 
on value-added expertise, including specialist software and 
IT systems design and development capabilities. Indian 
software firms have moved up the value chain, shifting the 
basis of their competitive advantage from just cost to a 
combination of cost, quality, and high-end R&D expertise. 
 Indian firms are also now themselves actively subcon-
tracting to lower-cost providers in China and elsewhere 
as they move away from contract programming as a major 
source of their revenues and into e-commerce and Web-
related products and services. They are leveraging their 
advantages in cost and skills through joint ventures with 
big, established players in the computing, telecom, and 
consumer electronics industries. The InfoSys–Microsoft 
joint venture focusing on MS.Net products is an example of 
this, as is the Mahindra–British Telecom venture. An esti-
mated 300 multinational companies have been engaged in 
R&D rather than contracting work in India. Intel, Microsoft, 
Cisco Systems, Samsung Electronics, Oracle, SSA Global, 
and others have set up R&D activities in Hyderabad, 
Mumbai, and Bangalore. 
 As a result of these developments, the industry has 
divided into a variety of subsectors. The IT software and 
services sector is still the largest and the key export 
revenue earner, but growth has slowed. A domestic soft-
ware and telecom industry, with a thriving venture capital 
industry, has also emerged in India. This is evidence of a 
strong and growing industry cluster that has evolved, un-
usually,  after  the export success of key firms in the industry. 
IT-enabled services (ITES) and business process outsourc-
ing (BPO) services, including call centers, transcriptions 
services, and back-office processing such as billing, tax-
ation, and accounting, have been growing rapidly. Hubs of 
these services are Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, 
Hyderabad, Kochi, Ahmedabad, and Pune. Some of the key 
players in this market are AMX, Convergys India Services, 
GE Capital, Standard Chartered, Dell, Healthscribe India, 
EXL Services, Daksh eServices, Wipro Spectramind, and 
24/7 Customer. 
 The development of the ITES/BPO subsector has brought 
home some of the threats as well as opportunities of liv-
ing in a globally connected world for people in Europe and 
the United States. According to the UK’s Communication 
Workers Union, for example, 33 firms including Barclays, 
British Airways, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, and Reuters have 
collectively outsourced 52,000 jobs serving UK customers 
to India. Norwich Union, the UK’s largest insurer, has built 
up a workforce of 3,700 people in India and plans to double 
this in the near future. This is a sign of the times, and 
as global firms discover new ways of accessing cheaper 
and/or better expertise in other parts of the world, some 
groups of people will experience new opportunities to join 
and benefit from the global economy while others will feel 
increasingly vulnerable to the threat of new competition.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Bumrungrad International in Thailand 
 Medical tourism (medical travel, health tourism, or global 
health care) is not as new as we might think. Spa towns and 
sanatoriums promoted international travel for health rea-
sons across Europe and beyond, from the eighteenth cen-
tury onwards. But the industry has entered a new phase as 
a globally competitive business worth an estimated US $35 
billion. Levels of quality, safety, and reliability in locations 
beyond the triad are now good enough to create choice for 
patient–customers and for price to become a key factor. 
As  Table   1    shows, there is a clear economic incentive for 
private and public health care clients to “shop around”. 
 The growing costs of employer health-care schemes in 
the United States are one reason for the growing popular-
ity of medical tourism. Canada and Mexico have developed 
thriving businesses based on their proximity to the US mar-
ket. A few US employers have also begun to build incen-
tives into their benefit packages to encourage employees 
to travel abroad for health care. This includes paying 
for travel and subsistence for time away from work in 
return for cheaper medical bills. The Maine-based retailer 
Hannaford Brothers, for example, will cover the total costs 
for employees to travel to Singapore for knee and hip 
replacements, including travel for a companion accom-
panying the patient. Cuba attracts 20,000 medical tourists 
per year, but for obvious reasons these have come from 
Latin America and Europe rather than the United States.  
 There are of course added risks for many people in ven-
turing beyond their borders in search of low-cost medical 
procedures. These can be exacerbated by the legal com-
plexities of extending insurance cover across borders. In 
an attempt to alleviate some of the risk and uncertainty, 
international health-care accreditation, offered by organ-
izations like the US-based Joint Commission International 
(JCI) and the associated Society for International Healthcare 
Accreditation (SOFIHA), is increasingly important.  
 There are also ethical issues beyond the economics of 
supply and demand, not least the problem that wealthy 
medical tourists divert scarce medical resources and 
expertise away from the poorest and neediest in develop-
ing countries. Massive investments in initiatives like the 
“MediCity” project in the Guragaon region near New Delhi 
focus on providing top-class health care for the rich, in 
the world’s poorest areas. Supporters cite the multiplier 
effect of medical clusters, which include employment and 
subsequent investment in local people and infrastructure. 
Critics simply see a further widening of global income and 
welfare disparities.

CHAPTER 20 EMERGING  ECONOMIES
  Bumrungrad International 
 David Boucher, a 49-year-old American, chose to have 
a colonoscopy at Bumrungrad International Hospital in 
Bangkok. His company gladly paid the $640 bill, sav-
ing over $250 on the costs of the same procedure in the 
United States. What is significant is that David Boucher 
was an assistant vice president of health-care services 
at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of South Carolina. His firm 
is part of the largest group provider of health care insur-
ance services in the United States, providing coverage 
for more than 100 million people. His main reason for 
undergoing the procedure in Thailand was to advertise 
the increasingly international options open to his firm’s 
1.5 million customers. He has been involved in signing 
a range of alliances with overseas hospitals and in dis-
cussions with local corporations and employee groups 
about this strategic response to the growing costs of health 
care in the United States. In 2008 Blue Cross took the 
initiative in medical “offshoring” by creating a partnership 
with Bumrungrad Hospital through its Companion Global 
Healthcare subsidiary. 
 Bumrungrad (“care for the people”) International was 
founded in 1980 and advertises itself as the largest private 
hospital in South-East Asia. As of December 31, 2010, it 
has 34 outpatient clinics, which include 250 examination 
rooms, with the capacity to service of over 4,000 patients 
per day. It has 554 beds and over 30 specialized treatment 
centers. With a workforce of 3,259 employees, it achieved 
a turnover of $317 million in 2010. Of the 1 million plus 
patients served each year, 430,000 are international and 
come from 190 different countries. Bumrungrad is a pub-
licly traded company listed on the Thai Stock Exchange. 
The majority shareholders are Bangkok Bank PCL and the 
Sophonpanich family. 
 Several key factors explain Bumrungrad’s success. The 
country has a history of prioritizing health care perhaps dating 
back to Prince Mahidol of Songla who gained an MD degree 
from Harvard Medical School in the early twentieth century. 
Ongoing support from the Thai government and members of 
the country’s ruling elite has made medicine and health care 
a national priority. The founders of Bumrungrad Hospital 
have focused on service quality and international credibility 
partly through their recruitment and incentives practices 
and by aiming for recognized accreditation. The hospital has 
more than 200 surgeons who are board-certified in the United 
States and it was the first hospital in Asia to be accredited by 
the US-based Joint Commission International (JCI). 
 To counter any potential criticism over the ethics of 
diverting medical resources to a top-class, but relatively 
expensive (for locals) hospital, the Bumrungrad Hospital 
Foundation was established in 1990. It helps the less privi-
leged in Thailand gain access to free medical treatment 
and health-care services. The Foundation has provided 
free medical help to over 100,000 Thais, including 122 pedi-
atric heart operations.

  Objectives of the chapter 
 In the 1950s China’s economy was the size of Sudan’s. Now, following 
30 years of liberalization, it is the second-largest economy in 
PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) terms. Political change has led to 
economic and social change which in turn is driving further political 
change and increasingly turbulent interdependencies with other 
parts of the globe. Rapid economic growth has led to an expanding 
domestic consumer market alongside continued poverty and growing 
disparities in wealth and income across the population of over 
1.3 billion people. 
 The scale, scope, and speed of these changes are unprecedented 
and the resulting range of commercial and competitive opportunities 
and threats should be of interest to every manager and every firm 
worldwide. In this sense China’s rise represents a major test of 
adaptability for firms looking to break into its growing domestic 
market and for those defending home markets against Chinese 
imports and FDI. In order to survive many firms need to understand 
the evolving strengths and weaknesses of Chinese businesses, 
identify the resulting complementarities and competitive conflicts, 
and reposition themselves accordingly. 
 The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Understand  the nature of the Chinese economy, the role of 
government, and the characteristics of China’s domestic market 
and its corporations.  
 2  Examine  the opportunities and constraints facing Western firms 
investing in China and the ways in which successful firms have 
adapted to succeed there.  
 3  Analyze  the degree to which Chinese firms are internationalizing, 
how and where they are selling and/or investing abroad, and what 
kinds of relative competitive advantages they appear to have.  
 4  Reflect  on the implications of China‘s rise, in “real-world” terms 
and for academic analysis and understanding of firm performance 
and business processes.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 The Oxford of ancient spires and ivory towers is well known 
among the Chinese. The successful, high-tech spin-off 
Oxford Instruments (OI) is less well known, but the com-
pany has worked to change this. Having sold a range of 
its products in China for over 10 years and experienced 
a 30 to 40 percent growth in sales year after year, senior 
managers at OI decided it was time to invest more heavily. 
The company opened representative offices in Beijing and 
Shanghai during the last decade and employed 20 people 
(including two expatriates). Then, between April 2003 and 
August 2004, OI registered as a wholly foreign-owned 
enterprise (  WFOE  ) and established a manufacturing facil-
ity. This was a major investment for a firm with a turnover 
of US$336.9 million and 1,341 staff around the world for the 
financial year ended 31 March 2011. But it was a necessary 
step given that over 90 percent of OI’s sales were from 
outside the UK, with approximately 10 percent in China. 
Moreover, its managers learned a number of important 
lessons along the way. 
 A key reason for investing directly in the Chinese mar-
ket, moving to a higher level of both commitment and 
risk, was to get closer to the growing number of Chinese 
customers. OI chose to build on the strong platform of 
representative offices through the establishment of a 
repair and service center for supporting its microanalysis 
detector customers in China. It also wanted to provide a 
platform for the assembly of top-level products. To estab-
lish a business entity capable of delivering these kinds of 
activities it needed some outside help. One way to reduce 
the risks of FDI is to hire local specialists who know about 
the local rules of the game and with the relationships and 
connections to help smooth the way. Another route is to 
hire experts who understand the international legal and 
regulatory conditions relating to an FDI project. In fact, 
when initiating its investment plans in China, OI did both. 
An international law firm was hired to ensure that global 
regulatory standards were followed. A local sponsor was 
also brought in (at a significantly lower cost) to help with 
the submission of the investment application to govern-
ment authorities. 
 The establishment process itself was relatively straight-
forward. Step 1 was to register the company name. Step 
2 was the submission of a feasibility report and articles of 
association to show the firm would be profitable and (most 
important) produce good tax returns. The WFOE, Oxford 
Instruments (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., was then given government 
approval and granted a trading license around three months 
after the start of the process. Post-registration procedures, 
including securing the “red”   company chop (an official 
company seal or signature stamp), took a little longer.  
 Further development of an effective and efficient HQ—
subsidiary organization structure and good working re-
lationships between head-office management and local 
managers in China were seen to be key priorities in the 
early stages of the China venture. The UK side defined a 
common internal financial reporting structure and shared 
the group business strategy, which the senior management 
in China was then allowed to revise and tailor to the local 
context and culture. The existing OI China chief representa-
tive, a Chinese national employed by OI for five years, was 
named as the general manager of the new organization. 
The leadership of this existing member of the OI team, 
with experience of working both in a related industry and 
in an English-speaking environment, to head-up the China 
operation was important for creating the necessary HQ— 
subsidiary relationships. As with any international expansion, 
an overarching question for OI was (and continues to be): 
what business processes and decision-making responsibili-
ties do we move to China and what do we keep in the UK? 
 Key constraints and challenges cited by OI include time- 
and resource-consuming Chinese bureaucracy at various 
levels including central, regional, and local governments, 
and individual firms (one customer required 11 different 
VAT invoices for a single sale). It was important for OI to 
link the new Shanghai facility into its global IT infrastruc-
ture but the instability of the local Internet required the 
company to invest in alternative (and more costly) connec-
tion methods. As OI continues to grow in China the task of

CHAPTER 21 CHINA
developing the necessary range of capable, experienced 
local managers in the sales and marketing functions as 
well as in operations will continue to be a focus. 
 Perhaps more significant than these problems have 
been OI’s concerns about protecting its intellectual prop-
erty rights (IPR) in China. OI’s R&D assets and tech-
nological capabilities underpin its primary competitive 
advantage. It has had to take steps to avoid losing these 
to local Chinese competitors. Some formal protection 
and registration steps are available, and these have been 
taken by OI, but this provides limited protection in China. 
More effective protection of IP is gained through placing an 
emphasis on the careful recruitment of staff in China and 
the retention of the development and some manufacturing 
of key technologies at home in the UK. OI’s customers are 
mainly top universities and organizations with high-level 
scientific research requirements. These customers are 
often co-developers of new technologies, so OI has built a 
range of cooperative alliances in which mutual trust and 
reciprocity are essential. 
 Many people talk about the importance of relationships 
in China. One interpretation is that in the process of devel-
oping relationships the Chinese are effectively performing 
a “credit check.” In the absence of stable or reliable formal 
contracting rules, regulations, processes, and institutions, 
more emphasis is placed on interpersonal trust as the 
reliable basis for doing business. What rules there are 
in China tend not to be applied consistently. This leaves 
plenty of scope for influencing processes and decisions, 
which places even more of a premium on having the right 
connections. 
 At an early stage in the project the following light-
hearted “rules” for doing business in China were presented 
by a speaker at a “Making it in China” session at the 
University of Cambridge: 
 Rule 1 : China is a highly regulated country, in which 
one needs to learn, understand, and follow countless 
regulations.  
 Rule 2 : China presents a chaotic and unpredictable 
operating environment in which anything is possible; in 
fact there are no rules.  
 Rule 3 : Rules 1 and 2 are simultaneously valid.   
 Understanding these local rules of the game has clearly 
paid off for OI. In 2008 the company won the UK Exporter 
of the Year Award “for the company demonstrating the 
utmost energy, novelty, patience and persistence, in the 
field of exports from UK to China during the year.” It 
has achieved an average annual growth of 50 percent of 
export sales to China. From its original Beijing office it has 
expanded to Shanghai (where it also has a customer sup-
port center), Guangzhou, and Chengdu. China has become 
the fastest-growing market for OI across the world. From 
annual sales of less than $1 million in 1997, annual sales 
to China now exceed $34 million.

 With over 1.3 billion people, China (see accompanying map) has the largest population 
in the world, more than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa combined. Although it is 
an ancient civilization the economy was only recently liberalized and opened up to trade 
and investment following Prime Minister Deng Xiaoping’s reforms in 1978. Since then it 
has been moving from a closed centrally planned communist state toward an open mar-
ket economy, and is increasingly participating as a major player in the modern world. 
While the rest of the world increasingly relies on China’s economic growth to maintain 
global economic momentum, China itself is feeling the political and social strains of this

unprecedented era of change. Its burgeoning economy attracts growing amounts of FDI as 
foreign ﬁ rms take advantage of opportunities to produce products cheaper and sell into its 
expanding domestic market. Chinese ﬁ rms are also evolving to compete not just in their

 Lists of facts and ﬁ gures that highlight the China phenomenon abound. It is the second-
largest economy in PPP GDP, the third-largest trader, the largest producer of rice, wheat, 
cotton and tobacco, red meat, coal, and aluminum. It has over three trillion dollars in 
foreign reserves (by far the largest in the world), 170 cities with more than 1 million people, 
the largest number of atheists of any country, and over 800 million subscribers to wireless 
phone services. It accounts for over 15 percent of the world’s luxury goods and manufac-
tures 70 percent of the world’s toys, 60 percent of the world’s bicycles, 50 percent of the 
world’s motorcycles, 40 percent of the world’s mobile phones, and 35 percent of the world’s 
coal (but reports 80 percent of worldwide deaths related to coal mining). 
 A particular boost came in 2001 when China joined the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) and began to attract record levels of FDI.   WTO accession   carried with it the

commitment to phase out non-tariff barriers, provide trading rights to foreign companies, 
and change conditions on foreign investment, and this has been happening. 1 
 The results have been impressive. GDP grew at an average of 8 percent per year, remi-
niscent of Japan’s “catching-up” period in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 2000, when many 
analysts envisaged a slow down, China has achieved average annual growth rates of over 
10 percent (see  Table   21.1   ). Exports and imports, as well as FDI, have surged but with a 
positive imbalance (exports exceeding imports) resulting in growing foreign reserves and 
contributing in particular to the massive deficit of the United States. China is now ranked 
as the fourth-largest economy in nominal GDP terms and second-largest in PPP terms. 
 The new era of export-led growth has resulted in economic and social development 
nationally, with a significant overall reduction in poverty across the whole of China (adjusted 
for purchasing power, China has grown to be 70 percent richer than India). But growth has 
been concentrated in the industrialized east and in urban areas, where per capita disposable 
income is more than three times higher than that in the rural areas and growing faster, at 
almost 13 percent compared to less than 10 percent in rural areas. The country is still classed 
as “lower-middle income” and 130 million Chinese fall below the international poverty line. 2 
 Trade and FDI are major indicators of the level to which an economy is integrated in the 
global economy and interdependent with other economies. The liberalization process in 
China centered on opening up the country in terms of inward and outward trade and FDI. 
In 2009, the global economic downturn reduced foreign demand for Chinese exports for the 
first time in many years down to $1.204 trillion (2009 est.), but China rebounded quickly, 
outperforming all other major economies in 2010 with GDP growth around 10 percent. 
China’s external trade recently reached $1.506 trillion (2010 est.). This represents almost 
40 percent of GDP. Note, though, that over 50 percent of these exports came from 
foreign-owned or foreign-invested firms (see  Table  21.2 ). The Chinese government vows

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
in the 12th Five-Year Plan adopted in March 2011 to continue reforming the economy and 
emphasizes the need to increase domestic consumption in order to make the economy less 
dependent on exports for GDP growth in the future. However, China likely will make only 
marginal progress toward these rebalancing goals in 2011. Two economic problems China 
currently faces are inflation—which, late in 2010, surpassed the government’s target of 
3 percent—and local government debt, which swelled as a result of stimulus policies, and is 
largely off-the-books and potentially low-quality. 3  China differs considerably from Japan, 
during its rapid economic growth phase, in this respect. So, while exports are normally seen 
as an indicator of local competitive advantage, this is not so straightforward in the case of 
China. Location endowments certainly convey some specific advantages, notably the lower 
costs of manufacturing that result from the availability of cheap labor. It is clear that the lib-
eralization process has allowed foreign multinationals access to this resource and, certainly 
in some industries, they are better equipped than local “infant” industry firms to leverage 
this advantage. So, a significant proportion of China’s export boom has been driven by 
foreign firms “migrating” existing manufacturing facilities from elsewhere into China and 
gaining the benefits of lower-cost exports to existing markets in the triad regions.  
 The attractiveness of China to MNEs, and the scale of their involvement, are shown 
by the sheer volume of FDI inflows over the past 20 years (see  Table   21.3   ). In 2008 China 
recorded US$108 billion of FDI inflows (many times higher than that of Japan, which has 
always attracted relatively low amounts of direct investment). China’s total stock of FDI is 
more than four times that for Japan, again despite its relatively recent economic liberaliz-
ation. The section below will discuss inward investment into China, followed by a review 
of the constraints facing firms trying to get into its growing domestic market. 
 Other firms are benefiting, without investing significantly in China, by extending their 
supply chains to take advantage of low-cost suppliers. At one point in the mid-2000s 
Wal-Mart imported over $25 billion in one year from China, making it the sixth-largest 
importer of any “economy,” with a larger volume than that of Russia. Wal-Mart’s import 
volume has since decreased and it is beginning to redress the trade imbalance in a small 
way by expanding its network of retail stores in China. (See the Real Case: Outsourcing and 
job losses to China in  Chapter 6 ). 
 Outward FDI from China has grown significantly in recent years (see  Table  21.3  ), partly 
as a result of the strong government push for international expansion (the “Going Global” 
strategy pursued by MOFCOM, see below) and the rising use of mergers and acquisitions 
(M&As) by Chinese firms to access Western markets, technologies, and brands. The final 
section in this chapter will examine a new breed of Chinese multinational firm.

CHAPTER 21 CHINA
 China has evolved from a closed, centrally planned system towards an open, market-
oriented economy. Reforms started in the late 1970s with the phasing out of collectivized 
agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices, ﬁ scal decentraliz-
ation, increased autonomy for state enterprises, the foundation of a diversiﬁ ed banking 
system, the development of stock markets, the rapid growth of the non-state sector, and the 
opening to foreign trade and investment. 
 Government reforms and the maintenance of the critical balance between liberalization 
and continued government control, guiding the development of capitalist enterprises and 
market incentives, are major factors responsible for the economic success currently ex-
perienced by China. They will continue to be critical factors for the sustainability of growth 
and development, as both the domestic and international contexts become increasingly 
turbulent. Comparisons between China and Russia are common and can be instructive. 
One study characterizes the differences as follows: 
  China gave priority to administrative reform, aligned bureaucratic incentives at all levels with growth 
and development objectives, and enhanced enterprise and local autonomy while preserving the capac-
ity of the center to exercise control. This approach transformed government bodies into real owners of 
the reform process and led to privatization over time that was largely welfare enhancing. Russia, on the 
contrary, gave priority to economic over state restructuring. Major reforms including mass privatiza-
tion were implemented in an environment of a weak state, which did not have the capacity to protect 
its ownership rights and coordinate reforms. As a result, privatization was a wasteful process associated 
with asset stripping and consequently with lack of legitimacy of newly established property rights. 4  
 The Chinese government has emphasized market-led growth by raising personal incomes 
and consumption while helping newly privatized industries to increase productivity through 
technology transfer and improved management. These aims, together with a policy of 
export-led growth, have been supported by the influx of FDI, also driven by the liberalization 
process. Multinational investors have pushed up exports while creating alliances and joint 
ventures which have helped local firms develop the necessary assets and skills to become 
more productive (although some studies argue that the effect has been to limit the competi-
tiveness of local enterprises as they have become subordinate suppliers to Western MNEs). 
 China’s central and provincial governments have worked on a “three-step develop-
ment strategy,” since the 1980s. This has involved regional development initiatives, now 
focused on controlling growth in the east of the country and subsidizing growth inland. 
“Key national projects” have supported infrastructure development on a massive scale, 
and the targeting of strategic industries, assets, and technological capabilities. Over time 
these kinds of government-directed initiatives have become increasingly international, as 
part of the “  Going Global  ” strategy. Premier Wen Jiabao has strengthened this approach, 
building on the initial impetus by Premier Zhu Rongji in 2001, as part of the government 
push for the development of national industry champions and the procurement of natural 
resources abroad. Both underpin a broader agenda of economic nationalism including 
energy security, geo-political positioning, and national competitiveness.  
 Another major policy objective in China is to boost high-technology industry sectors. In 
2010 PRC President Hu Jintao stated: “ A nation’s technological competitiveness determines its 
place and future in international competition. ” Efforts are led by the National Development 
and Reform Commission as part of the country’s 12th Five-Year Plan. Key industries, includ-
ing information technology, biotechnology, aerospace, new materials, high-tech services, new 
energies, and marine science and technology, are the focus of this initiative. The government 
is also facilitating both local technology-based start-up firms and encouraging high-tech FDI 
by upgrading the R&D infrastructure to develop innovative, patentable technologies. There

has been a huge expansion in the number of researchers in China since 1999. China now 
counts more researchers than Japan, and is on its way to potentially overtake the EU in this 
regard. The country is already second only to the United States in terms of advanced technol-
ogy exports, and it recently overtook Japan this year to become the second-largest investor 
in R&D (spending $121 billion in 2010). It spent around half of the UK budget on R&D in 
1994 and now spends well over three times as much as the UK each year. 
 In the coming years China plans to reduce its external imbalances; boost domestic 
demand, particularly consumer demand, and rebalance investment and consumption; fur-
ther promote balanced external sector development; speed up financial reform; and further 
improve the exchange regime “in a gradual and controllable manner.” There are, however, a 
range of ongoing problems, including: large disparities in per capita income between regions; 
unemployment, particularly affecting previous employees of   state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs)  , and migrants; corruption and other economic crimes; poor health and safety stand-
ards (for employees and consumers); environmental damage and social problems related to 
the economy’s rapid transformation; a rapidly aging population, due to the one-child policy.  
 The government retains substantial control over some areas of the economy (such as 
energy and transportation, financial markets, news media, infrastructure, land, and prop-
erty) and is influential in others (aerospace, telecoms, construction, retailing, and creative 
media) and less involved in others (automotive and consumer products). This means there 
are different levels and types of control exerted in different spheres of life. Add to this the 
variety of levels of government, from central to provincial to city and town, and the fact 
that these are no longer “harmoniously aligned.” Also add the fact that the application or 
implementation of laws and regulations varies greatly according to the specific location, 
situation, and people involved and we begin to get an idea of the reasons why China plays by 
different rules of the game (see  Active Learning Case: Oxford Instruments in China above). 5

 The massive growth of FDI into China has created the largest array of international mergers 
and acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and partnerships ever witnessed. These are clearly 
a major source of complementary assets, resources, and capabilities for the Western multi-
nationals and the local companies involved, which engage in a reciprocal give-and-take as 
part of the process of market entry. 
 China holds the double attraction for MNEs of a cost-effective source of production 
inputs, particularly cheap labor, and a growing consumer market. These strategic drivers 
equate to two simple forms of investment rationale: input-oriented investments and 
output-oriented investments. The former are designed to gain access to local resources, 
endowments, and country-specific advantages (CSAs) that will help the firm develop, pro-
duce, or deliver a product or service cheaper or better in some way. The latter are designed 
to expand sales by tapping into new and/or growing markets. Greater profitability should 
result from either or both, if they prove successful. 
 First and foremost, China has a reputation as a cheap manufacturing hub so cost advan-
tages are still the primary motivator for many companies. The average factory wage (around 
$200 per month, but varying by region and type of employment) is far less than in more 
industrialized Pacific Rim countries such as Taiwan and much lower than anywhere in the 
triad regions. In addition to low labor costs, other positives of sourcing in China include: 
lower capital costs and low-cost product design and R&D; large manufacturing capacities; 
and, for some, improvements in quality. The negatives include: communication problems, 
low product quality, long initial start-up times, intellectual property theft, increased manage-
ment complexity, operational and supply-chain challenges (see the section below). 
 MNE INVESTMENT INTO CHINA

CHAPTER 21 CHINA
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Airbus in China 
 Passenger volumes in China’s air transportation industry 
are expected to grow annually by 11 percent over the next 
20 years. This will make it the world’s second-largest 
aviation market, requiring an additional 1,790 aircraft to 
cope with the increased volume. Forty-nine new airports 
and 701 airport expansion projects are also expected 
under China’s Five-Year Plan. The Chinese government 
maintains a strong degree of control over the civil aviation 
industry. Respective agencies aim to improve the reliability 
and efficiency of the transport infrastructure and pro-
mote competitiveness among domestic firms. The General 
Administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) is the gov-
ernment agency responsible for the non-military aviation 
industry. It has rationalized the country’s airlines, complet-
ing mergers with the “Big 3”—Air China, China Eastern, 
and China Southern—and some of the smaller airlines. 
 CAAC and other agencies are also central to the 
expressed aim of the Chinese government to develop 
an indigenous “Made-in-China” aircraft to rival Boeing 
and Airbus. There is no doubt this can be done and the 
economic rationale is less relevant at this stage than the 
political symbolism. The government has begun funding 
this as a prestige project and will continue to do so until it 
succeeds. There are question marks, however, over how 
long it will take and how reliable, safe, and therefore mar-
ketable the final product will be. 
 The government’s determination, coupled with the inher-
ent advantages of low-cost production and the rapid rate of 
technology transfer and local learning, have impressed 
one experienced Chinese expatriate in the aerospace 
industry. He proposed: 
  Within the next 15 years there will be three major commer-
cial aerospace corporations; Boeing, Airbus and a Chinese 
firm. Soon after there may well be two; one of which will be 
the Chinese firm. 7 
 One senior British executive in China described the 
“Stairway to Heaven.” The three stages toward local tech-
nological maturity in aerospace manufacturing: 
 ■   Stage (1) “Made-to-print”: local manufacturers fol-
low simple designs for low-end (and later, high-end) 
manufacturing.  
 ■   Stage (2) Local firms take on responsibility for product 
modules or “build-kits,” including some redesign and 
process innovation.  
 ■   Stage (3) Full engineering partnerships with Western 
firms, with shared design and development, local 
responsibility for technology, quality, etc., and risk and 
revenue sharing (suppliers as shareholders in ongoing 
development processes). 
 Foreign firms in China, including Airbus and Boeing, 
Rolls-Royce and General Electric, are part of this plan. In 
order to gain access to the growing domestic market, esti-
mated to be worth over $300 billion over the next 20 years, 
they have had to establish partnerships with local Chinese 
manufacturers. These involve subcontracting, technology 
transfer, and training with an expressed aim of increasing 
the local content of aircraft. 
 AVIC1 (Aviation Industry Corporation of China) and AVIC2 
are responsible for all aerospace manufacturing in China. 
AVIC1 concentrates on large aircraft and is the main organ-
ization charged with developing a complete Chinese-made 
aircraft. However, rather than one unified “China” interest 
group there are local rivalries and factions competing 
with each other to become the lead player, not a simple 
them-and-us situation. As in other industries in China 
local competition drives learning. There is  “collaborative 
competition” guided, more or less, by the government, 
depending on the industry. On October 28, 2008, AVIC1 and 
AVIC2 officially merged because the previous separation 
resulted in split resources and led to redundant projects. 
The major focus of AVIC is to efficiently develop indigenous 
military technologies and to eventually compete with 
Boeing and Airbus in the civilian airline industry. During 
the Airshow China 2008, AVIC appeared in public for the 
first time. In the Singapore Air Show in February 2010, AVIC 
introduced the Comac 919 aircraft for the first time outside

the mainland. The aircraft is designed and built entirely in 
China will compete directly against industry stalwarts A320 
and Boeing 737 after completing flight trials in four years. 
It should be available commercially by 2016. 
 Airbus subcontracts around $60 million per year to 
five Chinese firms and this is expected to double over the 
next five years. Components made in China include A320 
wing parts, passenger doors, and landing gear bay. Two 
major joint ventures are at the center of Airbus operations 
in China, in the towns of Xian (Xian Aircraft Corporation 
with 28,000 employees) and Shenyang (Shenyang Aircraft 
Corporation with 20,000 employees). Both the local firms 
are state-owned enterprises (SOEs) operating under the 
AVIC1 umbrella organization. The head of the Xian plant is 
also the local town mayor. 
 The company has transferred manufacturing technol-
ogy and put in place a range of training programs to 
develop the local capabilities at these plants, and among 
local component suppliers. While improved productivity 
is important, the quality and reliability of the components 
produced here are far more important, given the safety-
critical nature of the final product. 
 Process improvement and innovation at the plant level 
are monitored or measured by a number of indicators. 
These include output and productivity measures, such as 
improvements in scrap yield and customer reject rates. The 
increased use of quality circles, “lean” management sys-
tems, and techniques such as the use of “visibility boards” 
which map out operations on the plant floor and monitor 
process changes, all indicate improvements in managerial 
and process-related capabilities. Other advances, such as a 
move from the use of 2-D to 3-D design drawings, demon-
strate engineering, design, and product development inno-
vations—all of which show how local Chinese managers, 
engineers, and plant-level personnel are learning through 
their interaction with Western counterparts.

 At the same time the rapid growth of the economy and the country’s growing purchas-
ing power are increasing consumer purchasing power as well as channeling investment 
into transportation, energy, utilities, communication systems, and other parts of its infra-
structure. In response to these attractions, MNEs have made a large number of investments 
in China and the country now hosts the largest number of MNE affiliates of any economy, 
employing around 24 million people. 6 
 Most investments have been in the form of equity joint ventures or WFOEs. However, 
because of the evolving legislation governing foreign investment into China, there has 
been a noticeable shift in the mode of market entry by foreign firms toward M&As and 
WFOEs. Ten Asian locations (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan province, Japan, the Philippines, 
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and South Korea), account for around 60 per-
cent of FDI inflows. This shows a strong regional effect, with Japan, China, and the larger 
satellite Asian economies evolving a strong, mutually beneficial growth cycle of trade and 
FDI. The United States, Japan, and the EU account for roughly similar proportions of FDI 
in China. Around 70 percent of FDI each year is in manufacturing industries and cumula-
tive FDI in China’s high-tech industry is over $120 billion, with more than 700 foreign-
affiliated high-tech companies operating R&D facilities in China. But service-related FDI 
is also growing. Investment in China’s burgeoning retail industry, for example, is very 
healthy. Based on a first-mover strategy, Carrefour (France) has become the fifth-largest 
retailer in China, while Wal-Mart (United States), which ranked the 14th largest, recently 
expanded its presence in China through the acquisition of Trust-Mart. 
 But the major distinguishing feature of China’s inward FDI is the wide range of firms and 
industries involved. The top MNEs from all industries have a presence, including Occidental 
Petroleum (coal mining), Motorola (producing semiconductors and mobile phones), General 
Motors and VW (joint ventures with a Shanghai automotive company), Dow Chemical 
(a polyurethane production joint venture), Heinz (a baby-food plant), Procter & Gamble 
(a joint venture producing laundry and personal care products), Hewlett-Packard (electronics 

679
CHAPTER 21  CHINA
joint ventures), RJR Nabisco (manufacturing Ritz crackers, among other food products), 
Airbus and Boeing (a series of joint ventures), Rolls-Royce (aero engines), Seagram (whiskey 
and wine), Babcock and Wilcox (a joint venture making boilers), Mitsubishi (a venture to 
build elevators). Other firms on this growing list include Bell Telephone, DaimlerChrysler, 
General Bearing, Gillette, Lockheed, Pabst Brewing, Peugeot, Squibb, VW, and Xerox. P&G 
even spent $300 million in one year just marketing one product: Oil of Olay!
A regional investment pattern is also increasingly strong. For example, in terms of sales, 
Taiwanese firm Hongfujin Precision Industry (Shenzhen), a subsidiary of Hon Hai Precision 
Industry (also known as the Foxconn Group), has surpassed Motorola (China) in size, 
becoming the largest foreign affiliate in China. Overall, the firm employs close to 1 million 
Chinese, mainly in the coastal region of Shenzen. But it has plans to move manufacturing 
into cheaper regions away from the east coast, including Chengdu and Wuhan. However, 
Foxconn has been involved in several controversies—most relating to how it manages 
employees in China, where it is the largest private employer. The decision to increase staff 
numbers and to move inland followed the suicides of 13 Chinese employees in 2010. On 
May 20, 2011, an explosion and fire broke out at one of the factories in Chengdu. The incident 
affected the iPad 2 assembly line and caused 3 deaths and 15 injured workers. The incidents 
threatened to tarnish the image of top global brands, such as Apple, Dell and Nokia, for 
which Foxconn produces laptops and smartphones. However, despite all these unfavorable 
news headlines, China still attracts electronics manufacturing companies, such as Taiwanese 
firms Quanta Computer and Inventec which are prominent in the list of top foreign affili-
ates in China. An increasing number of transnational corporations (TNCs) have established 
regional headquarters in Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. IBM relocated its global 
procurement headquarters to Shenzhen some time ago and is unlikely to move this inland.
Some firms have been successful in China. Although it is not doing so well elsewhere in 
the world, GM has generated profits for some time from its China operations. It accounts 
for an estimated 80 percent of the group’s Asia–Pacific operations, which make about a 
fifth of the firm’s net profits. Sales in China, driven by the Buick Saloon and Excelle Sedan, 
gave GM a market share approaching 10 percent to challenge Volkswagen, the long-time 
market leader (although most analysts predict overcapacity problems, reducing profits for 
all car firms in China in the coming years).8
As described in Chapter 15, Kodak has also done well in China, on the back of a $2 billion 
investment program that began in 1997. By working with the higher echelons of the central 
government in Beijing, Kodak managed to change the rules of the game in many ways, to gain 
exclusive rights to produce and sell photographic film in China. Despite its initial success in 
China, Kodak failed to adapt to new realities of digital photograpy and in January 2012 it filed 
for bankruptcy in the US courts.
Other firms investing in China believe, despite losing money, that they have invested in  
“a foot in the door” to the most important growing region in the world. But there is a third 
group of firms that have failed either to break into the market or to gain any return on their 
investments in China. Many following something of a “herd mentality” to get into China have 
failed to do their homework and been surprised to find how different, difficult, and risky the 
country is for inward investors (see the section below). Among those firms which failed miser-
ably in China was New Zealand’s Fonterra. Fonterra used to own 43% in the joint venture with 
SanLu Group. SanLu was a state-owned Chinese dairy products company based in Shijiazhuang, 
the capital city of Hebei Province. It was one of the oldest and most popular brands of infant 
formula in China before it went bankrupt. In September 2008, SanLu was involved in an 
adulterated milk powder scandal, affecting some 294,000 Chinese infants and killing six. Their 
baby milk powder had been tainted with melamine, which can cause kidney stones and other 
complications. It received a bankruptcy order from Shijiazhuang Court on 24 December 2008 
and several of its top managers were sentenced to long prison terms. As a direct consequence 
of the criminal contamination of milk in China, Fonterra recognised an impairment charge  

680
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
of $139 million against the carrying value of its investment in SanLu. Following this impair-
ment charge, Fonterra’s best estimate at that point of time, of the book value of its investment 
in SanLu was approximately $62 million, which was 69 per cent below its previous carrying 
value. In the process, Fonterra has learnt a painful lesson in international business. 
 A spate of acquisitions and investments in the beer industry in the mid-2000s bears a 
strong resemblance to a period in the mid-1990s when foreign firms rushed to enter the 
Chinese market and lost out. Between 1993 and 1996 international beer firms invested over 
$1 billion in the Chinese market and found that capacity far outstripped demand, prices 
were unsustainably low, and production plants were small scale and inefficient. Although 
the local breweries were virtually bankrupt, local governments, concerned about rising 
unemployment, were pumping money into them, making it impossible for foreign firms 
to compete. Fosters, Carlsberg, Bass, and Asahi all bailed out at a loss, leaving the two larg-
est local players, Tsingtao and Yanjing, to increase their dominance. Carlsberg alone lost 
$2 million between 1998 and 2000 before selling out. 9 
 In 2002 China overtook the United States as the largest beer market in the world and 
foreign firms rushed to invest once again. In 2004 Anheuser-Busch acquired the Harbin 
Brewery Group Ltd., Heineken NV bought 21 percent of Guangdong Brewery Holdings 
Ltd., Scottish & Newcastle plc acquired a minority stake in Chongqing Beer Group, and 
Interbrew SA acquired a majority stake in Zhejiang Shiliang Brewery Co. Ltd. More 
recently, in 2011 Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a deal to acquire 100% of Liaoning 
Dalian Daxue Brewery Co., Ltd. of China to expand its market share there. Most are doing 
much better in the Chinese market this time around, but local players are strong and 
beginning to look at market opportunities abroad. 
 Foreign R&D investment 
 MNEs, particularly those in IT hardware, the automotive industry, and pharmaceuticals 
and biotechnology, invest massively in R&D. Some of the largest investors, such as Ford 
Motor, Pﬁ zer, DaimlerChrysler, Siemens, Toyota Motor, and GM, spend more on R&D than 
the vast majority of developing countries. Only China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Brazil 
come close to these individual ﬁ rms in terms of total, national-level R&D expenditure. 
So the recent shift of R&D investment from the triad to emerging market economies and 
especially to China is signiﬁ cant. The share of foreign afﬁ liates in R&D in the developing 
world increased from 2 percent to 18 percent between 1996 and 2002 and has continued to 
grow. 10 China is the most favored destination for MNEs looking to invest in R&D abroad. 
 There are now over 300 foreign R&D centers in the country. In many cases inward 
investors are competing for privileged access to the Chinese market and will offer high-
technology investments to gain government support for projects. GM’s automotive R&D 
center, for example, was established in the late 1990s when global car companies were 
fighting to get the best joint ventures with a few, government-supported local firms. 
Boeing (United States) and Airbus (a European consortium) were also under pressure to 
transfer technologies and established local training in return for access. 
 Electronics and ICT (Information and Communication Technology) firms were among 
the earliest entrants. Motorola established the first China-based R&D center of any MNE 
in 1990 and now has 15 centers there, employing over 1,500 engineers. Microsoft has five 
centers with Microsoft Research Asia (MRA), one of the largest R&D centers in the world, 
responsible for the firm’s basic R&D for the Asian region. Nokia also has five centers in 
China, making its initial investment in 1998. General Electric located one of only three of 
its global R&D centers in Shanghai in 2003. 
 Pharmaceutical firms have followed suit, including $100 million research centers for 
both Novartis and GSK in the late-2000’s. The former, based in Shanghai, focuses on the

CHAPTER 21  CHINA
infectious causes of specific types of cancer endemic in China and Asia. It also works to 
combine Western technology and drug-discovery approaches with the traditional methods 
of Chinese medicine.11 For pharmaceutical firms the relatively low costs of field trials in 
China is one reason to invest.
More generally the shortage of science, technology, and engineering expertise in the 
West is a major driver. While the EU is said to have a shortfall of around 700,000 sci-
ence and engineering personnel, China hosts around 750,000 (second only to the United 
States) who are also cheaper to employ. Alongside this input-oriented or resource-oriented 
rationale for FDI in R&D, there are output-oriented or market-oriented reasons for R&D 
investments. These include the fact that industrial partners have moved to China. So, for 
example, much of the R&D conducted by Motorola’s semiconductor and component div- 
isions requires close collaboration with customers. Existing, Western-based customers have 
moved manufacturing activities to China and new customers are also emerging in China 
and the Asian region. These trends combine to create a strong incentive for Motorola to 
move its R&D “center of gravity” away from the West. China is also becoming a lead mar-
ket for some technologies. Again, taking the Motorola example, advanced consumer use of 
mobile phone services in China makes it a lead market for user-led innovation, prompting 
firms to locate R&D activities there to keep up with adoption trends. In May 2012, Google 
closed the deal to acquire Motorola Mobility for US $ 12.5 billion.
Over the longer term we can expect benefits for research institutes, universities, and local 
firms as MNE R&D networks supplement and support China’s national system of innovation. 
The Chinese government has identified foreign R&D investments as a critical part of China’s 
technology development strategy, originally outlined in the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001–2005), 
now a core part of subsequent Five-Year Plans. China overall spends more than double the UK 
on R&D, and this has been growing at around 9 percent per year in recent years, in line with 
GDP growth. The country has 17 million people in higher education and has established more 
than 60 industrial parks dedicated to Chinese graduates returning from overseas to set up busi-
nesses. Well-educated graduates and a very good science and technology infrastructure, relative 
to other developing and emerging countries, are important national assets for China. These 
are now underpinning the growth of high-tech firms, such as Beijing Yuande Bio-Medical, 
from Beijing Medical University; Datang Microelectronics, from Beijing’s Telecoms Research 
Institute; and Innova Superconductor and Tsinghua Solar, both from Tsinghua University.12

Why has OI invested in China? In what ways does its strategy fit with current 
trends in China?
OI’s investment in China was mainly “market-seeking” in that the firm had experienced grow-
ing sales through exports to China in the past and expected to further increase sales by estab-
lishing a presence in the market, alongside its customers. This investment has paid off well, 
with both exports and locally manufactured product sales growing well. FDI to establish local 
customer services and representative sales offices has supported this success. OI is benefit-
ing from cheaper local assembly costs for some products and has recently developed some 
R&D partnerships. These count as “resource-seeking” investments. Its strategy has continued 
to fit well with current trends in China. The growth in local demand for its products comes 
from both Chinese firms and foreign MNEs, including OI’s customers in the United States and 
Europe, that have moved operations to China. China may also evolve into an important source 
of inputs for its worldwide product development and R&D efforts in the future.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 According to folklore in China, “the mightiest dragon cannot crush the local snake”; 13 
in other words, local advantage can help a great deal in fending off larger and wealthier 
“predators.” In response to the very different market conditions and complex local 
rules of the game in China it is more common for multinationals to use intermediaries 
in the process of establishing a local presence here than elsewhere in the Pacific Rim. 
Government agencies such as those connected to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation offer such assistance, as do banks, law firms, and a vast range 
of consultancies. 
 As discussed above, the Chinese economy is centrally planned to some degree and 
the rights of all firms and individuals are strongly influenced by central, regional, and 
local government agencies. The government has a priority list of desired investments: 
ventures involving advanced technology, exports, or the generation of foreign exchange 
are given the highest priority. Understanding the policy agenda and the people respon-
sible for formulating, revising, and implementing it is critical for market-entry strategies 
and continued survival in China. Local policy is also connected to high-level political 
forces that are important to understand. For example, at the international level, China 
has been running a large trade surplus with the United States in recent years, and there 
is every reason to believe that, unless this situation is corrected, the US government will 
limit Chinese imports. The European Union has also been talking about limiting cloth-
ing imports from China because of the threat to local manufacturers (effectively because 
they are “too competitive”). These political reactions could result in a backlash against 
triad MNEs in China. These and other sources of country risk that can affect the success 
of an overseas investment should also be taken into account when considering the mode 
of entry adopted by MNEs. 
 In terms of mode of entry, firms can invest via a range of FDI mechanisms, including 
Sino-foreign joint ventures, joint exploitation, and exclusively foreign-owned enterprises 
(or WFOEs), foreign-funded shareholding companies, and joint development companies: 
 1   Sino-foreign joint ventures, also known as joint shareholding corporations, generally 
require the capital from the foreign party to be at least equal to a 25 percent share in the 
enterprise, according to Chinese regulations. 
 2   Cooperative businesses, also called contractual cooperation businesses, have the rights 
and obligations of different parties embedded in the contract. The foreign partner gen-
erally supplies all or most of the capital while the Chinese party supplies land, factory 
buildings, and other facilities.  
 3   Exclusively foreign-owned enterprises take the form of limited liability companies and 
regulations formally call for these to “adopt international advanced technology and 
facilities” or “all or most of the products must be export-oriented.”  
 4   Joint exploitation, development, and production enterprises relate to maritime and 
overland oil exploitation.  
 5   Foreign-funded shareholding companies involve Chinese and foreign shareholders 
holding the shares of the company and accepting liability according to proportional 
ownership. The shares held by foreign investors must account for more than 25 percent 
of the total registered capital.  
 Lessons from foreign firms that established operations in China some time ago and 
have developed some experience adapting to the local business environment illus-
trate some of the key difficulties. A survey by the US Embassy in Beijing and Gallup 
received 286 responses from American investors in China. 14  About half said they were 
 GETTING INTO CHINA 

683
CHAPTER 21 CHINA
profitable and a further half of the remaining firms were investing more in antici-
pation of future profits. They reported a number of difficulties that created additional 
risks or costs or required adaptation. The biggest problems were said to be, in order 
of importance: 
 ■  Transparency of laws and regulations 
 ■  Cost of doing business 
 ■  Customs procedures/export procedures 
 ■  Foreign exchange regulations/exchange rate risk. 
 Drawing on a number of surveys some key issues for foreign entrants are as follows: 
 ■   Market-access rights from equity holdings to taxation levels vary by industry and are 
changing rapidly. At least three, often more, levels of government, including local, 
regional, and central government agencies, have a direct and strong influence over the 
local rules of the game and give preferential treatment to local firms and to particular 
kinds of foreign investors.  
 ■   Chinese tax laws and other regulations governing business practices are complex. 
Despite the expense it is necessary to use attorneys, accountants, and consultants fam-
iliar with Chinese requirements.  
 ■   Contracting tends to be based around relationships and connections (  guanxi ) rather 
than formal, legal documents. These are the basis of mutual trust, with due diligence 
on potential business partners performed by checking their network connections, as 
opposed to formal market mechanisms. Relationships with the right connections are 
critical. Developing  guanxi  connections with the wrong partners creates obligations 
that may act as a trap. Contracts are just a starting point for doing business, not the 
end goal.  
 ■   Intellectual property rights (IPR) are not well protected, legally or via any local busi-
ness ethics. Investors need to carefully consider the implications of this, including 
the possibility of local firms getting and using key assets such as brands, patents, and 
business systems. One example of technology theft is in the high speed bullet train 
project. Foreign companies were apparently lured in and encouraged to hand over 
their technology with promises of a share of China’s domestic market. One of the 
bullet trains was subsequently involved in a serious accident leaving 40 dead and more 
than 200 people injured in Zhejiang, Eastern China on July 23, 2011. Having built 
by a joint venture between Chinese firm CSR Corp. and Canadian firm Bombardier, 
the accident led to a revealing series of accusations. This included allegations of mass 
corruption that went all the way to top of the railway ministry, then later technical 
problems. The Japanese firm Kawasaki and Germany’s Siemens were involved and 
they had warned the Chinese companies for years about the dangers of scaling up this 
kind of technology on this rapid pace. The underlying aim of Chinese companies is 
to combine foreign technology with native low cost labour and capital to undercut 
foreign firms in international markets. In this case, the domestic market was used as 
a testing ground and the Chinese firms became involved in high-speed projects in 
Venezuela and Turkey. Exports were meant to provide the payback. The accident, 
however, is a blow to China’s marketing efforts. Foreign train manufacturers were 
already challenging the legality of Chinese exports which included their technology. 
Now potential purchasers in the U.S., Thailand and Russia may be even harder to 
convince.  
 ■   Keeping face and being respectful are important. Group orientation and steeper hier-
archies characterize Chinese organizations. 15

There are parallels with the 
concept of social capital    

684
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 ■   Learning the language may be important in order to provide insights into the local busi-
ness culture. But too much of a willingness to do things the local way can be seen as a 
sign of compromise and ultimately weakness. Respect and credibility often come from 
asserting one’s own practices and rules of the game.  
 ■   The role of the Chinese partner in the success or failure of a joint venture or alliance 
cannot be overemphasized. Good partners will have the connections to overcome 
obstructive red tape and enable success; bad partners may have no power or knowledge 
to deal with obstructive bureaucrats, may violate confidentialities, and/or establish 
competing businesses. 
 ■   Although there is a large, cheap general labor pool, skilled managers, particularly those 
with marketing expertise, are difficult to find and keep. Engineers and technicians are 
similarly difficult to hold onto. 16 
 In some business sectors joint ventures are required, or were required until recently, 
by the Chinese government. In a joint venture the local partner is typically responsible 
for providing the land and buildings and for carrying out local marketing. The MNE is 
expected to contribute the equipment, technology, and capital and to be responsible for 
export marketing. In those cases where the multinational is manufacturing for sales in 
China, high-quality products, excellent service, and good promotional efforts are critical 
to success. Researchers have found that outstanding service and effective promotion can 
often make up for some lack of quality. However, price reductions and special sales terms 
are unlikely to offset poor quality. Similarly, while customer relations are important, they 
are often not enough to make up for poor quality or poor service. The Chinese want to 
buy the best quality available. 
 In light of these challenges joint ventures have a number of both benefits and 
problems. Majority-owned joint ventures give foreign firms an element of control 
combined with the benefits of gaining immediate access to experienced managers 
and their local relationship networks. Experienced managers report on the benefits of 
being able to access local business knowledge, including customer and supplier con-
nections and getting assistance with local officials and regulations. Local firms and/
or experienced local experts are normally important for helping customize and adapt 
existing products and services for local markets and for developing new ones targeted 
at the Chinese market.  Table   21.4    outlines some of these synergies between foreign 
and local firms.

CHAPTER 21 CHINA
 Studies show that recruiting, managing, and motivating personnel rank very high 
among key difficulties faced by foreign managers, even when working with local partners. 
Skill shortages and weaknesses in Chinese management, and the resulting low levels of 
labor productivity, also presented significant problems. But this can also reflect a failure 
on the part of foreign managers to (1) differentiate between labor costs and productivity in 
preparation for investing in China, 17  and (2) sufficiently adapt management and working 
practices to get the best out of a Chinese workforce. 
 According to experienced expatriates one of the most remarkable aspects of China is 
the sheer drive and motivation of its people. In general they are very hard-working and 
ambitious. Local cultural values and China’s past history do have a strong influence on 
workplace behavior, underlying a reluctance to take the initiative and the need for detailed 
instructions, for example. But a massive appetite for learning, advancement, and the 
rewards of capitalism among the people are central to China’s growth drive. Cheap labor is 
one of China’s major attractions, but experienced labor is increasingly scarce and there is a 
talent war for particular kinds of employees. As a result labor rates are increasing and firms 
are putting in place a range of strategies to retain good employees. Rises in wage costs may 
well outpace improvements in the productivity of the country’s workforce, which could 
result in lower export competitiveness. 18

Which “mode of entry” did OI select in China and what kinds of operational 
and practical challenges did it face? 
 OI registered as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) and established a manufac-
turing facility through this route rather than via a joint venture. Its major challenges, 
like many foreign firms in China, included the need to: understand and comply with 
local regulatory and legal conditions and deal with Chinese central and local authority 
bureaucracies; develop relationships with local customers and adapt to their contracting 
behaviors; recruit and train (and retain) local experts; develop an effective working re-
lationship between the local offices and the UK-based divisions; and protect its intellectual 
property rights.   
 As mentioned above (see  Table  21.3 ) outﬂ ows of FDI from China have grown rapidly over 
the last decade, albeit from small beginnings. For some observers growing outward FDI is a 
sign of the impending competition from emerging Chinese MNEs set to dominate particu-
lar global industries in the near future. For others this “infant stage” of international expan-
sion is set to continue for some time with Chinese ﬁ rms still ill-equipped to signiﬁ cantly 
expand overseas operations. 
 Private Chinese companies are stepping up their outward investment, but large SOEs 
account for the bulk of FDI outflows from China. The government is pushing for inter-
nationalization under its current “Going Global” campaign which is central to the current 
Five-Year Plan set by the CPC Central Committee. As a result much outward FDI (over 
70 percent in most years) comes from large Chinese companies under the state-owned

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
Asset Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. Total 
amounts are still, however, a small proportion of global FDI and dwarfed by the stock 
of inward FDI in China. 19  One study suggests that China’s outward FDI tends to come 
from “state-controlled enterprises with government sanctioned monopoly status” and 
is biased toward tax havens and neighboring economies. 20  The existing capital markets 
and corporate ownership structures tend to promote international expansion among 
larger firms championed by the government, particularly in the areas of energy and 
raw materials (which China is short of), rather than firms that may have particular 
strategic advantages. 
 Chinese firms are certainly appearing increasingly prominently in lists of corporate 
rankings.  Table   21.5    shows the top 25 Chinese firms in the  Forbes  ranking of the global 
2000 corporations. It also compares across years, showing how certain firms have moved

CHAPTER 21 CHINA
up the list and certain industry sectors have become more prominent. Utilities sector 
firms, banks, energy, and infrastructure companies dominate, and these are all sectors with 
strong government involvement. 
 But the  Forbes 2000  list and many other rankings which show a growing presence 
of Chinese firms simply measure size and/or profitability, not the degree of inter-
nationalization. Larger Chinese firms are arguably the result of the growing domestic 
market, not international expansion. When we examine the distribution of assets and 
sales of these large Chinese firms we see that they do remain highly dependent on their 
domestic and regional markets. All of China Telecom’s sales are intra-regional, as are 
98 percent of the Bank of China’s sales, and 86 percent of PetroChina’s (China National 
Petroleum) sales. 21   
 Studies that examine the degree to which Chinese firms have internationalized do 
suggest that they are still heavily reliant on country-specific advantages (CSAs) and 
have yet to develop the requisite firm-specific advantages (FSAs) to break into overseas 
markets to any great extent. More significantly, the rationale for focusing on domestic 
and regional (Asian) market opportunities appears to be a significant influence shaping 
outward FDI. 22  
 When they do venture abroad, Chinese firms follow the same logic as other MNEs. 
They are driven by the two main reasons, input-oriented investment (for resources) and 
output-oriented investment (for market access). As regards the former, a notable increase 
in Chinese investments in Africa has been driven by the growing demand for energy 
resources and raw materials in China. In recent years up to 40 percent of the global growth 
in oil demand has come from China, hence large-scale investments in Nigeria and other 
African countries with oil reserves. In 2008 a reciprocal deal worth a massive $9 billion 
was designed to give the Democratic Republic of Congo badly needed infrastructure in 
return for access to its raw materials. It involves the building of around 2,400 miles 
(4,000 km) of road, 2,000 miles (3,000 km) of railway, plus 32 hospitals, 145 health centers, 
and two universities. China will get access to an estimated 10 million tons of copper and 
400,000 tons of cobalt in return. 23  
 When we examine output-oriented or market-facing investment it is interesting to 
note the changes in the kinds of exports and FDI coming out of China, as indicators 
of its changing competitive advantage. In 1985 just 2.6 percent of Chinese exports 
were categorized as high technology, whereas almost 50 percent of exports were based 
on primary products or manufactured products based on natural resources. Twenty 
years later 25 percent of exports are high technology and less than 10 percent are 
from the latter category above. The initial boost in higher-value exports came from 
MNEs using China as an export base for their products. But high-technology, high-
value products are increasingly exported by local Chinese firms that are moving up 
the learning curve. 
 Local Chinese firms and other firms based outside the triad are able to learn via 
subcontracting relationships and joint ventures with larger multinational firms. In 
this sense MNEs are, to a certain extent, “breeding” their future competitors through 
technology and capability transfer that takes place within these interfirm relationships. 
This may be an unintended consequence of an alliance, or it may be made explicit, 
through the transfer of equipment, know-how, and training; the licensing of patents 
or brands; and other activities that are part of the negotiated contract. Western MNEs 
often trade their own knowledge, technology, assets, resources, and networks in order 
to get access to local knowledge, technology, assets, resources, and networks as part of 
a market-entry or expansion strategy.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 In the 6 months to the end of March 2011, Chinese businesses invested $64.3bn in 
Europe in acquisitions, trade deals and loan agreements; more than double the amount 
over the previous 11 quarters. This marked the start of a period of growing investment into 
Europe and other parts of the Triad, with the dual aim of accessing large (though mature) 
consumer markets and buying assets, technology and expertise to complement the cheap 
labour and other CSA endowments. 
 Overall, this means that China is evolving beyond its dominance as a global exporter 
of textiles, clothing, and toys and into areas such as autos (see the Real Case on Nanjing 
Auto below), white goods (see the case  International Business Strategy in Action: 
Haier abroad  below), consumer electronics, and mobile phones. In telecoms, for example, 
Chinese firms Huawei Technologies, Zhongxing Telecom, and Datang Telecom are but 
three government-backed, high-tech competitors which are quickly gaining ground 
against foreign equipment manufactures, including Ericsson, Lucent, Nortel, and Cisco 
Systems. Huawei commands the greatest market share in China for optical systems 
equipment, outselling all foreign competitors. 24  Although Motorola and Nokia still 
dominate China’s mobile handset manufactures, domestic enterprises such as Bird, 
TCL, and Konka are chipping away the leaders’ market share. In the semiconductor 
sector, US government analysts judge China now to be only two years or less behind 
US manufacturing technology and only one generation behind the commercial state 
of the art. 25  Huge Dragon, and China’s largest manufacturer of high-definition tele-
visions, Konka, are other examples of up-and-coming local firms. Similarly in computer 
software, local firms Founder, Red Flag, UFSoft, Neusoft, Kingdee, and Top Group are 
both partnering and competing with Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and Sun Microsystems in 
niche areas. 26  
 Lenovo, a high-profile Chinese firm, made the news in December 2004 when it bought 
IBM’s PC business for $1.75 billion. This was a landmark deal for China, not least because 
of IBM’s status as the archetypal US computer firm. Lenovo, originally called Legend 
when it was spun off from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the mid-1980s, makes 
about 30 percent of PCs in China and is number two in laser printers. The sale gave IBM 
$650 million in cash, along with an 18.9 percent stake in Lenovo worth $600 million. The 
merged firm had sales of about $12 billion a year, as well as a five-year license for IBM’s 
PC brands. Lenovo’s PC operations were then moved to be headquartered in upstate 
New York, rather than Beijing, and the company opened an R&D center in California’s 
Silicon Valley, as a “listening post.” 27  Lenovo is now listed amongst China’s leading “power 
brands,” many of which are in the white goods and consumer electronics sectors, such as 
Galanz, Changhong, SVA, TCL, and Haier. 28 
 As Chinese firms do aim to move higher up the value chain, design and R&D activ-
ities will become increasingly important, as well as access to advanced market economies 
abroad. For some fledgling MNEs this means investing overseas to acquire technologies, 
build or buy distribution networks and brands, and develop a wider portfolio of expertise, 
in keeping with the framework described in  Chapter 20  ( Figure   20.6   : Firm-specific advan-
tages for the new multinationals). 
 For some observers the growth of a new breed of multinationals from emerging econ-
omies warrants a new theoretical approach or set of explanatory frameworks. This is 
necessary, say some, because the current frameworks have developed out of the experience 
of Western-based MNEs and their international operations in other mature economies of 
the triad and expansion into emerging and developing economies. Although the two main 
types of FDI, input-oriented (resource-seeking) and output-oriented (market-seeking) 
FDI, are still relevant, the motivations of MNEs from emerging economies are significantly 
different. Studies indicate that they are internationalizing to fill current competitive dis-
advantages, such as technological capabilities and brands, rather than exploiting existing

 Haier abroad 
 Haier is arguably one of the fastest-growing consumer 
products multinationals ever. It began life in 1984 as a 
government-owned refrigerator manufacturer and grew 
68 percent per year on average between 1984 and 2005 to 
become one of the world’s largest white goods manufac-
turers alongside Whirlpool, AB Electrolux (Sweden), BSH 
Bosch und Siemens Hausgeräte GmbH (Germany), GE 
Consumer (US), and GD Midea Holding Co., Ltd. (China). With 
a workforce of 53,412 employees, it has established 15 manu-
facturing complexes and 30 overseas plants, 8 design centers, 
and a network of 58,800 sales agents worldwide. It has also 
become one of the most successful brands China has so far 
produced and controls more than 30 percent of China’s refrig-
erator, washing machine, and freezer markets. In 2010, Haier 
sales were US $8,839.6 million, of which over 90 percent was 
generated in China and less than 10 percent was foreign 
sales. 
 Haier began exporting products to overseas markets in 
1990. Six years later it started to internationalize through 
FDI in South-East Asia before moving further abroad to 
the larger triad markets (see the milestones in Table 1). It

advantages to expand abroad. (The case of Nanjing Auto’s takeover of MG supports this 
view, see Real Case below). 29 
 This view is opposed by others who see existing frameworks as sufficient, perhaps with 
minor adaptations, to explain and predict the behavior of Chinese firms. Despite dif-
ferences in underlying culture, capital markets, economic history, and the context from 
which these firms have emerged, the existing explanations for internationalization are still 
perfectly adequate. 30 
deliberately followed a step-by-step international expansion 
strategy aimed at “building volume and gaining interna-
tional experience” in Asia, starting with a joint venture in 
Indonesia in 1996. 
 A major step was taken in 1999, with a greenfield invest-
ment in South Carolina, making Haier the largest Chinese-
invested company in the United States, a decision made 
at a time when the US home appliance industry was in a 
downturn and most appliance manufacturers there were 
moving their manufacturing bases to other low-cost countries, 
including China. More recently Haier has established 
manufacturing operations in India. This allowed it to save 
up to 30 percent of the cost of locally sold refrigerators by 
avoiding import duties, as well as service its growing Indian 
customer base more efficiently.  
 Haier products are now available in 12 of the leading 
15 chain stores in Europe and in the top 10 chain stores 
in the United States. Its product range extends from 
refrigerators and freezers to commercial air-conditioners, 
microwave ovens, washing machines, dishwashers, tele-
visions, mobile phones, and computers. As well as manu-
facturing in the United States, Italy, Pakistan, Jordan, India, 
and Nigeria, it has localized aspects of product design, 
distribution, and sales processes to suit its international 
markets. The company also set itself a target of doubling 
foreign sales in subsequent years.    
 Learning to internationalize 
 Haier has successfully managed to overcome some of 
the key challenges for Chinese firms looking to go  global. 
Key to this has been the strong emphasis on quality, 
technological innovation, and brand building. Foreign 
alliances and partnerships have also been an important 
factor, supporting access to, or the internal development 
of, the relevant assets and capabilities underlying these 
strengths. 
 The strong emphasis on quality dates back to a famous 
incident involving the CEO of the Haier Group, Zhang 
Ruimin, in the mid-1980s. At what was the Qingdao 
Refrigerator Factory he used a hammer to smash up a 
number of defective refrigerators in front of managers 
and workers to drive home the importance of zero-defect 
manu facturing. Technological innovation, both process 
related and product related, has also been a cornerstone 
of senior managements’ philosophy and the firm reinvests 
a growing proportion of sales revenue into R&D. The 
company has worked with over 200 foreign  manufacturing 
firms in the home appliance design sector. It has also 
led over 60 national R&D and technology development 
projects as part of the Chinese government’s push for local 
 capability development in target industries. 
 In addition to a highly active brand-building strategy for 
the domestic China market, Haier has actively promoted its 
corporate and product brands overseas. In the US market, 
for example, it gained recognition through a high-profile 
sponsorship deal with the National Basketball Association 
(NBA) and for a period was the sole sponsor for the 
televised NBA competition. 
 One senior manager describes Haier’s internationaliz-
ation strategy as a three-stage process:  
 First, we should set up a large overseas production and 
sales network. Second, all Haier’s products that meet the 
local market demand should move into the major sales 
channels. And last, the company should produce main-
stream products in local markets.   
 Haier is clearly advancing down the route to becom-
ing more global in terms of sales and FDI. However, it is 
difficult to assess whether profits have flowed from this 
expansion process. We need to ask how much the firm 
still depends on the two key country-specific advantages 
(CSAs) that all Chinese firms need to break away from: 
(1) the cheap-labor advantage, and (2) the home-market 
advantage, which provides profits from consumers, 
retailers, and distribution networks which the firm 
knows well.

What kinds of threats and opportunities might OI face from new multinational 
firms from China and what strategic responses should it be considering? 
 OI is arguably already in a good competitive position in that its profitability stems mainly 
from its technological capabilities and investments in R&D, rather than low costs. Most 
large Chinese firms are building from an initial low-cost advantage, so whilst OI might 
experience some competition in its low-end businesses, it seems secure for now in the 
more technologically sophisticated business lines. IPR theft is a continuing threat and may 
help newcomers catch up rapidly in some key niche areas. But, while any high-technology 
start-ups or established instrumentation firms in China might eventually be able to com-
pete on the basis of new technology developments, they are weak in terms of customer 
relationships and brand recognition and therefore have limited access to markets outside 
China. There may be opportunities for OI to partner with smaller start-ups to develop 
new products, or build relationships with larger customers to provide products, technical 
services, and support as they internationalize.   
 1   One of the most important trends of our time is the economic development of China 
and its growing importance in terms of trade and FDI, as a cheap manufacturing base, 
as a growing market, and as a source of competitive opportunities and threats for all 
MNEs. Its economic growth and rising influence in the global economy may, however, 
be slowed or halted by social and political forces, domestic or international.  
 2   In terms of the scale, scope, and speed of economic growth, China is unprecedented. It 
is larger and growing faster, across a broader range of industries, than Japan during its 
rapid development phase.  
 3   The Chinese government at various levels has a strong influence over the economy, 
business practices, and the opportunities open to MNEs. The “Going Global” policy and 
initiatives to develop target industries and indigenous innovation capabilities are central 
to the plans of central government.  
 4   Inward and outward FDI have grown. MNEs are attracted to the growing domestic 
market and opportunities for cheaper manufacturing. MNEs are also establishing R&D 
activities in China.  
 5   MNEs looking to get into the Chinese market need to be aware of its particular differ-
ences and difficulties, including changing regulations governing foreign investors; cus-
toms, tax, and foreign exchange procedures; specific cultural traits and the importance 
of  guanxi ; the problems with intellectual property rights; and the need to secure good 
partnerships and local expertise.  
 6   The current concern is that China and other emerging economies are increasingly com-
petitive in manufacturing, taking investment and jobs from the triad regions. The key 
concern in the near future will be with their competitiveness in high-technology and 
knowledge-based businesses. 
 7   Some Chinese firms are expanding abroad. The extent and impacts of this international-
ization of a “new breed” of MNEs are hotly debated.

  REVIEW AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 
 REAL CASE 
 Citigroup in China 
 The banking industry faces many barriers to globalization. 
Overcoming cultural differences and dealing with varying 
regulations and financial systems make it very difficult to 
establish a truly global bank. Citigroup (or Citi), formed 
in 1998 by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group, is 
a leader in international banking and one of the largest 
companies in the world, in terms of assets. In 2010 it had 
$65 billion in revenues and 263,000 staff around the world 
(compared to 358,000 at its peak in 2008) and served over 
200 million customer accounts in more than 100 countries. 
40 percent of its income originates in the United States, 
18 percent from Europe and Middle East, 19 percent from 
Latin America, and 23 percent from Asia. 
 Citigroup enters a developing country via mergers and 
acquisitions where possible, and implements its own mar-
keting strategy. In the first stage of development, it caters to

the global customer (usually a large corporation) by providing 
short-term loans, cash management, and foreign exchange 
services. During a country’s second stage of development, 
as demand grows in the face of a burgeoning middle class, 
Citigroup begins to offer personal financial products. 
 In China, the political climate has limited Citigroup 
expansion plans in the Asia region. Citigroup opened its 
first office in China in 1902 but was thrown out by the new 
communist government of Chairman Mao in 1949. Even 
after it was allowed back into the country, its business 
was restricted mainly to foreign currency. China’s market 
potential, however, always attracted the bank, and when 
the country began to show interest in opening its bor-
ders and joining the World Trade Organization, Citigroup 
stepped in as a key broker in negotiations with the US 
government. The bank’s efforts are paying off. In the 1990s, 
the Chinese began to open their economy and make com-
mitments for further reforms. By 2001, import tariffs had 
been lowered to an average of 15 percent from 44 percent 
in 1992, and continued to decrease, averaging 9 percent by 
2006 and less in subsequent years. 
 Deregulation is allowing Citigroup to implement its 
emerging market strategy in China. In the initial phase, 
the bank marketed only to large foreign corporate clients. 
By 2004, it had expanded its customer base to include 
travellers, business people, wealthy Chinese with foreign 
exchange needs, and local businesses. Citigroup’s inter-
national network has also made it attractive to Chinese 
MNEs operating in other markets. Among these is Lenovo, 
a Chinese PC manufacturer that today controls over 
25 percent of the domestic market and has begun to expand 
abroad. Other examples include Konka (electronics), Haier 
(consumer appliances), and China Telecom. Local banks do 
not have the same level of international service. 
 Deregulation not only allows Citigroup to open fully 
functional branches to cater to the wealthy and, increas-
ingly, to the middle class, but also attracts more foreign 
clients. UPS and FedEx, for instance, both seek to open 
100 percent-owned delivery systems in China. Home to the 
largest number of mobile phone subscribers in the world 
and nowhere near saturation, China also expects to attract 
telecom service providers and product manufacturers. In 
short, opportunities for foreign investment in China are 
creating a large number of MNE subsidiaries from which 
Citigroup can draw its client pool. 
 Citigroup’s second marketing stage for emerging mar-
kets is expanding into personal banking. To some degree, 
Citigroup now offers consumer banking, corporate and 
investment banking, and insurance in the Chinese market. 
The bank does not yet provide a full range of consumer 
services to the entire population. Indeed, its banking fees 
are kept high for all but very large deposits to attract 
only the wealthier segments of the population. In 2010 it 
launched its ‘Citigold Private Client’ services into China, 
Singapore and Hong Kong targeted at high net-worth indi-
viduals. It also developed its online banking services. 
 In 2002, the firm was first allowed to offer foreign exchange 
services to Chinese nationals but is not yet allowed to offer 
consumer banking in yuan. In 2004, it partnered with the 
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank to offer a dual-currency 
credit card that could be used in yuan and US dollar transac-
tions, the first of its kind in China. The credit card business is 
tricky in China because there is no credit rating agency, but by 
moving forward with this service, Citigroup’s goal is to create 
brand awareness that will allow it to dominate the market 
once it matures. The bank is likely to move consumers into 
mortgages, personal loans, pension funds, and other financial 
products in the final stage of its market-entry strategy. 
 Although Citigroup has a definite first-mover advan-
tage in the Chinese market, it still faces competition 
from domestic banks. These include the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China and other large foreign competi-
tors such as HSBC, which also has extensive experience in 
the region. The Pudong deal was relatively small compared 
to rivals’ acquisitions and it has continued to look for big-
ger opportunities. Mainland China recently generated only 
2 percent of Citigroup’s Asian revenues, as against higher 
percentages from smaller economies, including Hong Kong 
(12 percent), South Korea (14 percent), and India (10 per-
cent). It clearly has much work to do to build a position in 
China commensurate with its global standing.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Nanjing Auto makes the MG 
 China became a net exporter of cars for the first time 
in 2005, due in part to the large-scale inward invest-
ment from non-Chinese car manufacturers, channelled 
into joint ventures with local firms in this industry. But 
exports account for a small proportion of total sales. As 
annual production in China reaches 20 million, demand 
from the domestic automotive market has grown fast 
enough to make China the largest automotive market in 
the World. 
 VW entered China well ahead of the competition 
through a joint venture with government-owned Shanghai 
Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) in 1984. A sec-
ond joint venture with the First Automotive Works (FAW) 
in 1991 helped it reach a dominant position (56 per-
cent market share) in the growing Chinese car market 
before other foreign competitors were even allowed to 
enter. GM was a later entrant and had been involved in 
a range of technology transfer initiatives before being 
allowed to establish manufacturing operations in 1997 
through a $1.6 billion joint venture with SAIC. GM reached 
a 10 percent market share to challenge VW. But both GM 
and VW faced growing competition from new foreign 
entrants after the 2001 WTO deregulation rulings began 
to take effect. Ford, Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, and Suzuki 
all entered the market in the early to mid-2000s. More 
significantly, local car-makers also started to come into 
their own around this time. 
 SAIC, which merged with Nanjing Automotive 
Corporation (NAC) in 2008, Chery Automobile, and FAW 
are the largest local producers. SAIC has a string of 
joint ventures, including with VW and GM, while FAW has 
partnerships with Mazda and Toyota, in addition to its 
main ally, VW. In contrast, Chery is one of the more inde-
pendent local players as is Geely Automotive Holdings. 
Initially established as a fridge maker, Geely has stead-
ily accelerated sales and expanded its manufacturing 
operations to reach a 5 percent share of the mainland 
market. 
 Low cost is the one key advantage at this stage for 
indigenous car firms, gained through cheap labor, avail-
able land, and capital (in China much of it initially from the 
government). This only temporarily makes up for weak-
nesses in most other areas, from manufacturing tech-
nology, process innovation, product design, to sales and 
branding. But the industry has moved up the value chain 
in its short history. Low-cost advantages are increasingly 
complemented by capabilities in design, engineering, 
manufacturing, marketing, and management which are 
driving process and product innovation. Most firms have 
partly developed and partly bought into these assets and 
capabilities through joint ventures with Western car-
makers. More unusually NAC accessed them directly by 
acquiring one of the oldest and best-known car firms in 
the UK, MG.  
 Based in Longbridge in the heart of the West Midlands 
manufacturing region, MG was part of MG-Rover, a cor-
poration that combined two famous British car brands 
that dated back to the early 1900s. A turbulent history 
of take-overs and management failures had brought the 
firm to collapse in the early 2000s, despite the strength 
of its design, engineering, and technology divisions and 
the loyalty of customers. In May 2005 NAC bought the 
MG brand name, physical assets including the powertrain 
technology, and the manufacturing rights to the MG range 
of cars in a deal worth over $80 million. In parallel NAC’s 
then competitor SAIC announced it would build the Rover 
75 (relaunched as the Roewe) in China using the rights it 
bought from MG-Rover in 2004. 
 NAC shipped the MG assets to China and, in the space 
of a year, by March 2007 the firm had set up production in 
the Pukou High-Tech Development Zone in Nanjing and 
locally made cars were rolling off the plant line. The aim 
was to develop the plant to eventually produce 200,000 
autos, 250,000 engines, and 100,000 gear boxes, with 
an explicit strategy to keep costs low by expanding and 
improving the local Chinese supply chain. To do this it 
has embarked on a wide range of recruitment and train-
ing programs, which involve ex-MG-Rover plant man-
agers, engineers, designers, and other employees from 
the UK operation and from suppliers. These are providing 
the Chinese with the capabilities not just to operate the 
plant, but to improve the product design, manufacturing 
quality, and cost and to conduct R&D and engineering 
development to create future automotive products.  
 The acquisition provides an interesting illustration of how 
far the kinds of advanced assets and capabilities required 
to produce and sell complex products can be bought and 
transferred across continents. It begs the question: how 
far can changes in ownership drive geographic shifts in 
competitive advantage? What it shows is that knowledge, 
expertise, and skills have to be transferred alongside 
hardware and technology for the full set of manufactur-
ing process and product competencies to be developed 
by the recipient firm. This takes a long time, during

which the recipient remains dependent on knowledge and 
expertise from the firm and/or regional “cluster” of firms 
in which the original capabilities evolved. 
 Some of these capabilities will be transferred via training 
programs and by recruiting some of the MG-Rover man-
agers, designers, and engineers directly to work in China. 
Others will be accessed by redeveloping some functions at 
the original Longbridge plant in the UK, linked to the main 
manufacturing plant in China. Subsequent plans by NAC for 
Longbridge have included an R&D, engineering, and test 
center for MG models; HR recruitment and purchasing and 
logistics centers to serve China and Longbridge; a sales 
and marketing base for the UK and Europe; and eventu-
ally a local assembly plant for European markets. NAC 
is effectively developing a new multinational network to 
leverage the location-specific complementarities between 
the Midlands and Nanjing. It hopes to produce cars for both

    1  The WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Investment 
Measures (TRIMs) is still being implemented. It should 
eventually lead to the end of Chinese requirements on trade 
and foreign exchange balance, local content, and export 
performance for foreign investors. The Chinese government 
is also committed to relaxing foreign investment restrictions 
in many important service industries, including distribution 
services, telecommunications, financial services, and 
professional services;  http://www.wto.org .

local rules of the game in his book  Mr. China , (London:

experience as a British investor who teamed up with a 
Wall St. banker in China in the early 1990s. Together they 
invested over $400 million in a range of industries (including 
auto components and beer) in China and lost most of it 
because of the lack of legal and institutional infrastructure, 
fraud, and their own naivety regarding Chinese business 
practices; Fonterra,  www.fonterra.com ; “Fonterra Takes 69pc

   16  This list partly comes from interviews and discussions, 
including several with Alice Huang, Managing Director of 
Enter Consulting, a firm based in Shanghai that supports 
inward investors. See Collinson et al., op. cit.  
   17  This is a common theme in studies, stemming from the 
tendency for firms to focus due-diligence efforts on cost 
cutting and “sell” investment propositions internally 
and externally on the basis of simple financial metrics. 
Comparative data on labor costs per hour are relatively easy 
to gather. Productivity is context specific and influenced by 
multiple factors and much more difficult to anticipate.  
   18  See, “How Rising Wages Are Changing the Game In 
China,”  Business Week , March 27, 2006. This pattern, of 
rising costs of particular kinds of labor, was predicted by 
Eli Hecksher (in 1919) and Bertil Ohlin (in 1933) in an 
economic model that was further refined by the American 
economist Paul Samuelson. The H-O or HOS model (or 
theory of factor endowments) took trade theory beyond 
the simple assumptions made by Ricardo about labor 
productivity to look at the relative availability of different 
factors of production (primarily land, labor, and capital) 
and therefore their relative price (rent, wages, and interest) 
in each country. These will determine the products in which 
a country has a comparative advantage, and in which it will 
therefore tend to specialize and trade. See, for example, 
J. R. Markusen,  Multinational Firms and the Theory of 
International Trade  (Boston, MA: MIT Press, 2004).

  Objectives of the chapter 
 Over the course of this text we have seen how much the world of 
international business has changed in the last decade. In the next 
decade, there will be even more changes to the field of international 
business. This will affect both the country and firm factors and the 
strategies of multinational firms. One of the most prominent changes 
is the increased attention paid to corporate social responsibility—
essentially the ethical behavior of the firm. In this chapter we explore 
two useful frameworks to help analyze the future of international 
business. First, we consider how multinational enterprises (MNEs) 
often serve as “flagship” firms at the hubs of business networks. We 
relate this to country-level (environmental) and firm-level strategies 
and future trends. Second, we develop a framework to analyze the 
impact of civil society on trade and investment agreements. This 
will incorporate a discussion of corporate ethics and the role of 
 non-governmental organizations (NGOs)  as they can affect such 
agreements. 
     The specific objectives of this chapter are to: 
 1  Examine  how these changing developments will create both 
challenges and opportunities for MNEs over the next decade.  
 2  Explain  why research will continue to be of critical importance to 
the field of international business.  
 3  Examine  three frameworks in which MNEs can cope with their 
changing political and economic environments.  
 4  Relate  the importance of the NGOs and ethical issues to the 
strategies of multinational enterprises.

CHAPTER 22 CORPORATE ETHICS AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
 What do Apple, Google, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Procter & 
Gamble and Amazon.com have in common? In 2011, they 
were among the world’s most admired companies in the 
Fortune annual ranking. The nine key attributes of repu-
tation are innovation, people management, use of corporate 
assets, social responsibility, quality of management, finan-
cial soundness, long-term investment, quality of products 
and services, and global competitiveness. These rankings 
are calculated based on a survey of business people’s per-
ceptions. The top 20 firms according to business people are 
shown in  Table  1 . 
 Of course, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) may 
not like these companies and today in a world of corporate 
social responsibility, the viewpoints of NGOs and other 
stakeholders are important. In particular, NGOs are often 
critical of the poor environmental performance of MNEs. 
Partly in response to this, the survey also highlights 
eight companies which are devising innovative ways to 
make their firms greener, including Coca-Cola, Southwest 
Airlines, Procter & Gamble, Google, Microsoft, Fedex, 
Amazon.com, and McDonald. 
 Coca-Cola has developed technology to produce fully 
recyclable plastic bottles which are 30 percent composed 
of plastic made from sugar cane. This reduces the amount 
of petroleum byproducts used to make the plastic. Coke 
wants to share the technology. The company has partnered 
with Heinz so the ketchup maker can use partially plant-
based bottles for 120 million ketchup containers.  
 Southwest Airlines is one of the few airlines which 
wash the plane engines at night so that they burn fuel 
more efficiently during flights the next day. Southwest 
is also investing in the Federal Aviation Administration’s 
updated navigation system, which help planes fly the best 
routes, save excess fuel costs. The next initiative is to 
lighten the cabins of the planes. So, Southwest is adding 
lighter weight carpeting, seat covers and life vests. The 
company is running its new cabin design by regulators 
and hopes to make an official announcement about it later 
this year. The end result will be even more fuel-efficient 
flights, which translate to an even greater profit margin 
for Southwest.  
 IT companies like Google and Microsoft are trying to 
focus on data center efficiency, which requires lots of 
power. Furthermore, Microsoft has formed partnerships 
with industry rivals to promote green technology. Along 
with AMD, Intel, Oracle and other technology giants, 
Microsoft is on the board of a project called the Green Grid, 
which is designed to use IT to promote sustainability.

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
 Amazon.com doesn’t make many tangible things, but it 
ships large quantities of books every day. And when the 
online store asked customers how it could improve the 
shopping experience, buyers said they wanted less packag-
ing. Amazon has worked with suppliers such as Philips to 
cut out the clamshells and stick with boxes that are easy 
to open and made from recyclable materials. By cutting 
wasteful packaging, the company has also reduced its 
carbon footprint. 
 In general, the managers of both large MNEs and smaller 
firms are extremely aware of their wider social and ethical 
responsibilities. Most of these firms have developed explicit 
environmental programmes and have appointed senior 
managers responsible for corporate social responsibility 
activities. Some firms have even hired former NGO activists 
and environmental politicians to help improve the firms’ 
environmental policy and social programmes. However, 
the success of these managerial initiatives remains open 
to question, as discussed in this chapter.

  How have NGOs changed the external environment in which MNEs operate? Why is Apple the world’s 
most admired firm by business people? Why is a firm like Google likely to be more admired by NGOs?   
 2 
  As MNEs operate across the world, why are there no “global” or “international” environmental 
agreements to set rules for sustainable development? 
 3 
   Where would a company like Coca-Cola, or others in Table 1, be positioned in  Figure   22.7   ? Why?     
 MNEs are ﬁ nding that one of the major challenges they face is to develop effective strategies 
for coping with changing environments. There is an ongoing process of triad-based attack 
and counterattack, and today’s success could be dislodged by the competition tomorrow. The 
international microcomputer chip industry is a good example. During the 1980s the Japanese 
dominated this industry, pushing out many US and European competitors to gain the major-
ity of the world market. In the early 1990s US ﬁ rms (most notably Intel) counterattacked and 
regained the lead. 1  This process explains development in many industries, from autos to com-
puters to real estate. 2  It also helps to explain why continual innovation and strategy modiﬁ -
cation are necessary for MNEs to retain their competitive advantage. In doing so, multinationals 
will be focusing increased attention on strategies that are designed to cope with changing 
environments.  
 Perhaps the most important change in the external environment affecting firms doing 
international business has been the development of stakeholder theory and the increased 
attention paid to corporate social responsibility. In the second part of this chapter we will 
focus upon such issues of corporate ethics and the need for MNEs, and other firms, to 
develop strategies that exhibit FSAs in corporate social responsibility. In other words, a 
firm does not need merely to react to external government controls and regulations, or 
to new social pressures, but it can proactively develop a first-mover response, such that it 
gains an FSA in ethical behavior. The main examples we use deal with issues of concern in 
the sphere of the natural environment. Thus, we conclude this book with a focus on the 
issue of corporate strategy and environmental regulations, especially as these are relevant 
to international trade and investment agreements. 
 It is important to link the two new frameworks developed here back to the familiar firm 
and country factors in the FSA–CSA matrix of  Chapter   2   . Essentially environmental regu-
lations, and other societal pressures on the firm, can be regarded as CSAs. Whether they 
are positive or negative CSAs can be shown on the vertical axis of the FSA–CSA matrix.

CHAPTER 22 CORPORATE ETHICS AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The novel thinking developed in this chapter is that the firm can turn such regulations into 
an FSA. Of course, this FSA would be shown in quadrant or cell 3 of the FSA–CSA matrix. 
Thus this chapter is an extension of the thinking first developed in  Chapter   2    and then 
related to strategic management (in  Chapter  8 ), organization structure (in  Chapter  9 ), 
and the integration/responsiveness framework (in  Chapters  10 and  17 ). Another way of 
looking at environmental regulations is as part of the home-country diamond (in Porter’s 
single-diamond model). They can also be part of the host-country CSAs in terms of the 
double-diamond framework, as discussed in  Chapter  10 . 
 We conclude that the two frameworks developed in this final chapter serve to summa-
rize many of the conceptual themes developed throughout this book. Finally, in keeping 
with our practice throughout the book, we give real-world examples in this chapter of the 
nature of corporate social responsibility and ethical behavior by MNEs and other firms 
doing international business. 
 MNEs are supplementing or supplanting their old strategies in a number of ways in order to 
compete more effectively worldwide. 3 Two of the most recent developments include going 
where the action is and developing new business networks with governments, suppliers, 
customers, and competitors. 
  Going where the action is 
 One strategy that is proving increasingly important is the need to go international in order to 
keep up with the competition. 4  Successful multinationals have operations in the home countries 
of their major triad competitors. For example, IBM’s strongest competitors are located in 
the United States, Europe, and Japan. In turn the company has facilities in all three places, to 
monitor the competition as well as to conduct research. Moreover, the communication net-
work among the company’s facilities allows each one to share information with the others and 
to provide assistance. This also helps the company to maintain a strong competitive posture. 5 
 Another reason for locating near major competitors is that some markets develop faster 
than others and the experience and knowledge that is learned here can help in other mar-
kets. For example, in the US market IBM is now trying to develop a strategy of providing the 
best service in the industry. In the past the company had often referred service problems to 
its dealers. However, now the firm is attempting to address these issues directly, ensuring 
a higher level of service and taking back customers who were lured away by smaller firms 
with better service, support, and prices. If this strategy works well, the company is likely 
to use it in other worldwide locations where small firms have been gaining market share. 
Today, IBM makes very sizeable profits from software and services. Now IBM is customer-
led, it is asked by its clients for what they want from IBM, and IBM is producing solutions 
rather than specific products to link together the complicated global infrastructure. IBM is 
also making a big push into cloud computing, developing software to move big corporate 
clients into the cloud and building vast data centres to host them. It is also looking at ways 
in which technology can make an impact in the healthcare sector, with sensors to monitor 
patients remotely. But these are competitive sectors where IBM may struggle to achieve the 
kind of market dominance it once achieved in mainframe computers. 6 
 Another important aspect of a location-focused strategy is that MNEs often establish a 
home base for each major product line, and a multiproduct-line company will have “centers 
for excellence” all over the world. These centers are responsible for providing global lead-
ership for their respective product lines. For example, Asea Brown Boveri, a Swiss firm, 
uses Sweden as the home base for transmission equipment. Research, development, and 
production are centralized in that country. Nestlé, the giant food company, has the world 
 DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES 

704
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
headquarters for its confectionery business in the UK because this home base is more 
dynamic in terms of the marketing environment and the high per capita consumption of 
confectionery products. At the same time Nestlé has made its Italian company, Buitoni, the 
world center for pasta operations. Meanwhile, Siemens has designated the United States 
as the world home base for medical electronics because this is where the market is most 
dynamic and will provide the company with the best chance of developing and maintain-
ing state-of-the-art products. 
 It is also important to realize that the product line will dictate the degree of globalization. 
For example, food companies in Europe tend to be less international and more regional 
in focus. Local tastes vary widely and there are only modest gains to be achieved through 
large-scale operations, so European food companies tend to have an extensive local pres-
ence. The same is true for home appliances, which are often produced for regional markets. 
On the other hand, when European companies have become truly global, they have tended 
to focus on products that do not require high levels of integration on a worldwide basis. 
 So some companies have a need for global centers throughout the world, whereas others 
tend to stay in closer geographic proximity because of the nature of their product lines. 
Still others combine both of these approaches, as seen in the case   International Business

 How have NGOs changed the external environment in which MNEs operate? 
Why is Apple the world’s most admired firm by business people? Why is a 
firm like Google likely to be more admired by NGOs? 
 NGOs have captured public attention and won a lot of support in North America and Western 
Europe for their “green” and anti-globalization agendas. MNEs cannot afford to ignore 
NGOs, especially US and EU MNEs whose home base “diamond” is threatened by NGOs 
which can influence government policy and regulation. Apple has gained recognition as the 
most successful MNE because it has an innovative approach to consumer electronics such 
as the iPhone and iPad, which are very successful with consumers around the world. In 
contrast, Google while still being consumer friendly has also developed an explicit environ-
mental energy saving strategy, making it more popular with green environmentalists.  
  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 3M 
 The 3M company is a major MNE that has over 50,000 
products comprising everything from office supplies to 
construction and building maintenance to chemicals. 
It employs over 80,000 people and has operations in 
60 countries. How does the firm manage such a large 
international operation? One way is by matching its global 
strategies with the needs of the local market. Some goods 
such as home video cassettes are standardized and are 
sold on the basis of price and quality. Culture and local 
usage are not important considerations. Other products 
are greatly influenced by local preferences or regu-
lations; telecommunications is an example. Each country 
or region of the world has its own modifications for local 
application. 

705
CHAPTER 22 CORPORATE ETHICS AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
 The company balances its global strategies and national 
responses on a region-by-region basis. For example, in 
Europe the company has set up a series of business cen-
ters to address local differences. The company also uses 
European management action teams (EMATs) to balance 
the needs of subsidiaries in responding to local expec-
tations with the corporation’s need for global direction. 
Today, 3M has 50 EMATs in Europe, each consisting of 
from 8 to 14 people, most of whom are marketing person-
nel. These groups are charged with bringing the firm’s 
global plans to life by helping their execution at the local 
level. EMAT meetings, which usually occur quarterly, are 
designed to create action plans for the European subsidi-
aries. When the meetings are over, the members then return 
to their respective subsidiaries and begin executing the 
plans. In Asia the company uses a different approach, rely-
ing heavily on its Japanese operation to provide much of the 
needed direction to the subsidiaries. At the same time there 
are regional centers in Singapore and South Korea that 
help subsidiaries to address their local markets. In Latin 
America, meanwhile, 3M uses a macro approach, conduct-
ing business on a national rather than regional basis. 
 The company also carefully identifies those products 
that it will sell in each geographic area while following two 
basic strategies: (1) try to be the first in the market with 
new offerings because this strategy puts the competition 
at a disadvantage; and (2) grow new markets gradually by 
picking out those products that address the country’s most 
pressing needs and focus exclusively on them. Commenting 
on its worldwide strategy, a company executive said: 
  We don’t believe in formulating a single global strategy for 
selling video cassettes in India and laser imagers in France 
and Post-it brand notes in Brazil. For each of 3M’s 23 stra-
tegic business centers in each region the company’s strategy 
is a blend of global, regional, and local companies and that 
will continue.

 No study of international business would be complete without paying attention to the role 
and importance of theoretical frameworks. In  Chapter   2    we introduced the ﬁ rm (FSA) and 
country (CSA) matrix while in  Chapters   10    and    17    we used the integration and national 
responsiveness matrix. Much of what has been discussed in this book is based on the 
research ﬁ ndings leading to such basic frameworks. In many cases the data were drawn from 
government statistics, company records, and business reports on recent developments and 
strategies. In other cases the information was garnered from formal studies that examined 
managerial behaviors among senior managers. Collectively, research provides important 
input for building international business theories and for formulating and implementing 
future strategies. As a result, it is useful to both academicians and practitioners. 
 Unfortunately, research findings can be confusing and contradictory. For example, 
many studies are extremely limited in focus and thus cannot be generalized to a universal 
setting. Similarly, when research is broadly based, it is likely that the findings cannot be 
generalized to specific situations. Porter’s Diamond, for example, helps to explain how 
triad nations develop competitive advantage. However, its value to non-triad nations, as 
explained in  Chapter   10   , is limited and the findings must be revised and modified in order 
to apply them. Despite such shortcomings, however, international business research will 
continue to be of critical importance to the field. Such research will allow us to test theories 
and to refine their practical applications. 
  Theories of international business 
 A great many theories have relevance to the study of international business. In some cases 
these are ﬁ rst constructed and then tested. A good example is Adam Smith’s theory of labor 
specialization. Smith presented this concept over 200 years ago in his  Wealth of Nations , and in 
recent years learning curve analysts have conﬁ rmed these ﬁ ndings. Of course, not all theories 
 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS RESEARCH 
FRAMEWORKS 

706
PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
have had to wait centuries before being proven. However, this example does illustrate that 
international business research can be advanced through the formulation of useful theories. 7 
 In other cases theories are being tested for the purpose of reconfirming earlier find-
ings. This is particularly important in learning how well a theory stands the test of time. 
A good example is the theory of lifetime employment in Japan. For many years theorists 
have argued that lifetime employment creates a highly motivated workforce and Western 
organizations would be wise to copy this approach. More recent research, however, reveals 
that lifetime employment is less useful as a motivator than as a control tool for ensuring 
worker loyalty and performance. In return for guaranteed employment, workers stay with 
the firm for their entire career, work hard, and are compliant with management’s wishes. 
Sometimes unions are employer dominated and then they serve more to maintain har-
mony within the employee ranks than to represent the workers. 
 Based on an analysis of empirical data collected on this topic, two researchers recently 
concluded, “Lifetime employment is offered within a context of loyalty and benevolence based 
on cultural values. Its impact, however, is to increase the control of Japanese employees by 
managers.” 8  Moreover, these researchers found that lifetime employment was not widely used 
by firms in tight labor markets because it was not possible to control the workers, who could 
easily find jobs with other companies and who derived little motivation from such guarantees. 
 This type of research is also important because it generates new hypotheses for testing. 
For example, as workers in large companies with guaranteed lifetime employment near 
retirement (55 to 60 years of age), will management replace them with younger people who 
are not given such guarantees? As the competitive environment increases, will companies 
stop offering these guarantees because they reduce the firms’ flexibility in responding to 
changing conditions? Will young workers entering the Japanese workforce during this 
decade be motivated by such guarantees, or will they turn them down because they are 
unwilling to commit their career to one firm in return for job security? These types of ques-
tions will be focal points for future international business research efforts, since changing 
economic, cultural, and social environments are creating new conditions in which MNEs 
must compete. Research can help to shed light on the effect of these changes.  
  Practical applications of the theory 
 Research is also going to play an increasing role in helping to uncover how and why multi-
nationals succeed. In particular, greater attention will be given to strategy research that is 
designed to explain why some ﬁ rms do better than others and how these strategies are chang-
ing. For example, during the 1970s traditional international business strategy gave strong sup-
port to   strategic fit  , the notion that an organization must align its resources in such a way as 
to mesh with the environment. Auto ﬁ rms had to design and build cars that were in demand, 
and this might mean a variety of models and accessories, depending on the number of mar-
kets being served. Similarly, electronics ﬁ rms had to maintain state-of-the-art technology so 
as to meet consumer demand for new, high-quality, high-performance products. Today, how-
ever, successful multinationals realize that they must do much more than attempt to attain a 
strategic ﬁ t. The rapid pace of competitive change is requiring linkages between all segments 
of the business from manufacturing down to point-of-purchase selling, and in every phase of 
operation there must be attention to value-added concepts. 9  So the basic strategic concepts of 
the past, once widely accepted, must be reconsidered and sometimes reformulated.  
 Other research areas likely to receive future attention will be cross-national collaborative 
research by individuals from two or more countries and joint efforts by international and 
non-international researchers. The world of international business is getting larger every 
day, and it is critical that research be designed not only to help explain what is happening 
and why it is occurring, but also to help predict future developments and thus better pre-
pare students and practitioners for the international challenges of the twenty-first century.

CHAPTER 22 CORPORATE ETHICS AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
 In the future governments will become more selective in their approach to industrial policy, 
aware that in the past billions of dollars have been wasted by bureaucratic efforts to stream-
line and refocus economic efforts. This recent trend is likely to result in more government–
business efforts. However, the success of international business ﬁ rms will depend more 
heavily on the companies themselves than on the government. Some of these developments 
will include the forging of new business networks for competitive advantage and the devel-
opment of new relationships with non-business sector groups. 10 
  Forging new business networks 
 Increasingly, the relationship of successful MNEs with their suppliers, customers, and com-
petitors is changing. New strategies based on trust and reciprocal support are replacing the 
old business–client relationship in which companies sought to dictate the terms and con-
ditions of sales and services. 
 In the case of suppliers, the current trend is toward reducing this number to a small 
group of reliable, efficient, and highly responsive firms. These suppliers are then brought 
into a close working relationship with the MNE so that both sides understand the other’s 
strategy and plans can be formulated for minimizing working problems. The multinational 
will detail its needs and the supplier will draw up plans that ensure timely, accurate deliv-
ery. Another trend is the increase in the amount of responsibility being given to suppliers. 
Previously they were charged only with manufacturing, assembly, and delivery. Now many 
MNEs use their network partners to develop new materials and components, to perform 
industrial engineering functions, and to assume liability for warranties. 
 In the case of customers, network linkages now involve changing the focus of the re-
lationship from one in which sales representatives would work directly with MNE purchas-
ing agents to one in which sellers interact more directly with their customers. D’Cruz and 
Rugman have explained this idea in the case of   flagship firms  , characterized by global 
competitiveness and international benchmarks. 11  In the conventional system the flagship 
firm and its customers maintain an arm’s-length relationship. However, new relationships 
are now being forged in which there is a direct link between the flagship firm and its most 
important customers (see  Figure   22.1   , segments 1 and 2), whereas traditional relations 
are maintained with some distributors to serve the firm’s less important customers. At 
the same time, network linkages are being developed with key distributors to serve other 
customers better. (Again see  Figure   22.1   , segments 3 and 4, etc.)  
 Network arrangements are also being created between international competitors in the 
form of joint ventures, technology transfers, and market-sharing agreements such as a 
Japanese firm selling the product of a US firm in the Japanese market in return for a similar 
concession in the United States. Mazda and Ford Motor are excellent examples. 
 These strategic relationships among suppliers, customers, and competitors are becoming 
integral parts of MNE strategies, as are linkages to non-business organizations such as unions 
with which multinationals are now sharing their strategies in the hope of creating a working 
relationship that will save jobs and ensure company profitability. Partnerships are also being 
fostered with universities that can help to educate and train human resources, and research 
institutions that can provide scientific knowledge that is useful for helping organizations to 
develop and maintain worldwide competitiveness. Another group that is getting increased 
attention is government, since this institution can be particularly helpful in supporting leg-
islation that will encourage the upgrading of the workforce, development of state-of-the-art 
technology and products, exports, and the building of world-class competitors.  Figure   22.2

provides an illustration of the basic structure of the   five partners   in an effective network. 
Notice how these relationships go beyond commercial transactions and involve network 
linkages to a wide variety of other groups. This is one of the waves of the future in inter-
national business.

key customers, key 
competitors, and the non-
business infrastructure 
 The international environment of the future will continue to be one of rapid change, and 
MNEs will have to stay abreast of a number of developments. The political and economic 
environments will present the greatest challenges. 
 Political environment 
 As already seen, the political environment affects MNE activities in many ways. For example, 
all major triad groups have trade barriers that are designed to limit the sale of foreign goods 
in their countries. This in turn typically results in trade negotiations that are designed to 
open up these markets and/or to reduce trade deﬁ cits. Protectionism trends are particularly 
treacherous because they are psychological as well as legislative. 12  That is, even when trade 
barriers are lowered, there is a tendency for people to be protectionist and to “buy local.” 
 Many managers say that they favor open markets, but, when questioned closely, they state 
strong support for protectionist strategies such as government assistance to domestic busi-
nesses and help for home-based firms that are seeking to go international. 13  In short, many 
business people speak out for free trade but advocate policies that put foreign firms at a dis-
tinct disadvantage. The Japanese are some of the strongest supporters of free trade. However, 
according to the US trade representative these opinions are not translated into action. For 
example, Japanese telecom fees make it difficult for foreign companies to compete effectively. 14 
 The ability of US firms to penetrate foreign markets will also be influenced by US govern-
ment policies. The Clinton administration was initially more vigorous than its predecessor 
in pushing for open markets in Asia. 15  US government trade policy toward Japan and South-
East Asia generally aims to open markets in the region. The objective was to increase the 
market share of US firms in this geographic triad region as well as to reduce the large trade 
deficit that the United States is running, most noticeably with China. The latter is likely to 
receive particular attention, given that in recent years China has sold far more to the United 
States than it has purchased from it. 16  The Bush administration reacted to the failure of the 
WTO Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations by working out sets of bilateral free 
trade agreements, such as one with South Korea, although this was stalled by the Congress 
and still not approved by Spring 2008. In December 2010, both the United States and South 
Korea have hailed their long-awaited free trade agreement negotiated as a “win–win” deal. 
President Barack Obama said the deal was “essential” in boosting US exports. 
 At the same time overseas companies are lobbying their governments to negotiate 
greater access to the US market. For example, the governments of less industrialized countries 
are putting pressure on triad countries to liberalize agricultural trade. International 
institutions like the IMF, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like Oxfam, 
criticize the United States, the EU, and Japan, some of the more vocal supporters of free 
trade, for subsidizing their agricultural and manufacturing industries to the detriment of 
less developed countries. 
 A related issue is political risk. For example, in Latin America, Venezuela and Brazil 
have left-leaning populist governments. Venezuela is a large exporter of oil and Brazil is the 
manufacturing hub for Latin America, a host country for VW and Mercedes-Benz, among 
others. 17  The financial crisis in Argentina led to some factories being abandoned, followed 
 COPING WITH CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS 

710

by worker occupation of these factories. These workers started producing again and sought 
to be legitimized by the government as owners of the factory. 18 
 Hong Kong, the former British colony, was returned to China in 1997. The Chinese 
government agreed to allow the region to maintain relative autonomy and to continue 
functioning under its own economic and political systems for 50 years after the takeover. 19 
China is now heavily investing in Hong Kong and has more total direct investment there 
than in any other country. At the same time two-thirds of foreign investment in China 
comes from Hong Kong Chinese. Many Hong Kong business people believe that relations 
with China have worked out for the betterment of both sides. 
 Another country where political risk is being re-evaluated is Vietnam. 20 Relations 
between the United States and Vietnam are now normalized, and the country has business 
ties with US multinationals that can provide assistance in helping to rebuild the economy. 
The IMF and the World Bank provided funds for critical highway and seaport projects. At 
the same time, Vietnam has been attracting billions of dollars in manufacturing investment 
from European and Asian companies. Now that the US trade embargo has ended, Vietnam 
has attracted US banks, aircraft, and power plant manufacturers to help in the rebuilding 
effort. One major reason that Vietnam is interested in rapprochement with the United 
States is that it sees it as a counterbalance to Japan and the growing military might of 
China. As relations between the two countries continue to thaw, political risk will decline 
and Vietnam will become an increasingly popular area for investment opportunities. 
 The continuing development of free trade agreements will also work to lessen political risk. 
For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) binds Canada, the United 
States, and Mexico together into an interdependent market in which each nation profits by 
working harmoniously with the others. 21  The same is true for members of the EU as well as for 
other economic unions, from those being fostered in Latin America to those in Africa and the 
former Soviet Union. Firms doing business in these geographic areas will find that the great-
est ongoing challenge is more likely to be economic than political. There will also be further 
consolidation of the world’s trade agreements into a triad-based system (see  Table  22.1 ).  
 Economic environment 
 The economic environment will be replete with opportunities for MNEs. US multinationals, 
for example, will continue to be a dominant force in the export market, as seen by the fact 
that the United States has consistently ranked as the world’s largest exporter over the last 
decade. Meanwhile Asia–Paciﬁ c MNEs, except for those of Japan and Australia, will beneﬁ t 
from the comparatively lower cost of the labor in their home countries. 
 New economic opportunities will also be provided by the rise of non-triad-based firms 
that become successful MNEs. In Mexico, for example, Anheuser-Busch before being 
acquired by InBev, used to own approximately 50 percent of Grupo Modelo, maker of 
Corona and the country’s largest brewer. In July 2008, Belgian brewing company InBev 
completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch for US $52 billion dollar in equity, creating 
the world’s largest beer company, Anheuser-Busch InBev. After years of unsuccessfully 
vying to be the market leader in Peru and losing to local Inka Cola, Coca-Cola’s Peruvian 
bottling and distribution was transferred to its competitor. In turn, Inka Cola products are 
now sold in North America, mostly to immigrant South Americans, through the Coca-
Cola company. As non-triad countries develop, new opportunities for telecommunication 
and other infrastructure companies will materialize. 
 New goods and services will help to create new markets. An example is Apple’s iPod, an 
MP3 player that can store a large quantity of music. Firms are competing to provide ever bet-
ter MP3 players to gain a share of this growing market. New PC technology is also decreas-
ing the weight of laptops while improving their processing speed, their graphics, and their

multimedia capabilities. These products lend themselves to a globalization strategy since 
purchasers buy them based primarily on performance characteristics and not on cultural 
requirements. As a result, computer industry MNEs are likely to find this century offering 
both new opportunities and new challenges. The opportunities will come in the form of 
emerging markets since sharp declines in PC prices tend to increase demand sharply. The 
major challenge will come in the form of increased competition since PC technology tends to 
be easy to emulate, and so the barriers to entry for new firms are often quickly surmounted.  
 An accompanying development is the rise of the Internet as a source of competition. 
Today a growing number of MNEs are becoming electronic companies, or e-corporations 
for short. 22 The Internet is driving down costs and helping companies reach thousands 
of new potential customers worldwide. 23  As a result, MNEs are now throwing out their 
old business models and creating new ones that will help them do business electronically 
with customers who in the past were not accessible to them. 24  One of the keys to this new 
development is the rapid rise of both businesses and households with Internet access. As 
recently as 2010 approximately 58.4 percent of the European population and 77.4 percent 
of that in North America used the Internet. 25 As a result, e-commerce is now accounting 
for a growing percentage of GDP in these economies. 26 
 Major MNEs that are finding themselves unable to compete in the ever-changing 
international arena are restructuring 27  and realigning markets. Examples include (1) air-
craft manufacturing, where Boeing is having to scurry to meet competition from Airbus; 
(2) autos, where General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler are trying to stave off the onslaught 
of Japanese competition in their home market; and (3) household electronics, where such 
well-known manufacturers as Sony, Panasonic, and LG are finding that the markets for 
products such as DVDs are becoming saturated and that Chinese manufacturers are prov-
ing themselves to be excellent competitors. 
 New strategies, carefully crafted to the specific market, will offer increased opportun-
ities for MNEs. In Japan, for example, the success of firms such as Toys “
R
” Us and Spiegel 
is a result of learning how to work within the system. As discussed in the Real Case in 
 Chapter  3 , Toys “
R
” Us set up its own retail stores by teaming up with the former director 
of McDonald’s Japan for local knowledge and investment capital. It relentlessly pursued its 
objective of its discounted “category killer” toys despite vigorous opposition from small, 
local merchants who opposed letting Toys “
R
” Us into the Japanese market. Thanks to its 
dogged determination, the company was eventually given permission to open a large retail 
store and by 2000 it had over 100 stores. As of 2009, it had 167 stores in Japan. 28 Spiegel, 
famous for its mail-order business, formed a joint venture with Sumitomo Trading 
Company and introduced an upscale fashion catalogue in Japan. The company directed its 
efforts at women from 20 to 40 years of age. Catalogue selling proved so successful that by 
the mid-1990s the joint venture was generating annual sales of over $160 million. These 
efforts, which are characterized by strategies that are designed to circumvent problems in 
the distribution system rather than trying to meet them head on, are typical of those strat-
egies that will be used in Japan and other foreign locations during the years ahead. 
 Business-to-business (B2B) 
 An example of an ethnocentric MNE is Air Liquide, the French manufacturer of indus-
trial and medical gases. At its Paris headquarters, the vice presidents for each geographic 
region are all French. All regional managers in foreign ofﬁ ces are French and have pre-
viously worked in Paris. This allows Air Liquide to have a standardized, “global” strategy 
that treats the world as one integrated market. This works as the nature of the industry is 
B2B. The main customers of Air Liquide are other large industrial manufacturers in oil, 
iron and steel, and other types of chemicals. These companies depend on the gases supplied 
by Air Liquide. It has ﬂ agship relationships with many of those manufacturers. 

713
CHAPTER 22 CORPORATE ETHICS AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
 The main competitors of Air Liquide are the UK-based BOC Group and Linde AG. 
While Air Liquide is more concentrated in the core gas business, its competitors are more 
diversified into the gases needed for consumers, transportation, etc. 
 In general, the largest number of B2B relationships would be between ethnocentric 
partners. Then there are clear rules of the game—both partners are in mature, standard-
ized industries with easy-to-maintain, long-term relationships. So, B2B occurs in chemi-
cals, autos and auto parts, oil, and other “commoditized” sectors.    
 The tendency toward international trade liberalization has been exempliﬁ ed by two recent 
developments, namely the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1993 and the 
deeper integration of the European Union (EU). Both these regional triad agreements have 
developed from previous agreements. The principles of the 1989 United States–Canada Free 
Trade Agreement (FTA) are also the basis for NAFTA. Similarly, before 1995, the European 
Union was the European Community (EC). Albeit very different, in terms of goals and content, 
these two examples of trade and investment liberalization create a protected business environ-
ment for member countries, while in turn discriminating against third-country businesses. 29  
 From the Canadian and Mexican perspective, the main rationale for negotiating the 
FTA, and subsequently NAFTA, was to secure access to the US market for both exports 
and FDI. Mexico also sought to create a secure economy for inward flows of FDI. In con-
trast, the EU’s predecessor, the EC, was considered by many observers to create a “Fortress 
Europe” at the expense of third-country firms. 30 
 Figure  22.3 classifies the different industries in the countries affected by trade liberaliz-
ation in NAFTA. (It will also provide an initial framework for the EU.) The vertical axis 
denominates economic integration and the horizontal axis reflects the political sovereignty 
of nation states. The left side column therefore shows low political sovereignty in the form 
of national treatment. With national treatment, discrimination against foreign investors is 
not permitted; they are to be treated equally with domestic investors in the application of 
host-country laws and regulations. 
 Quadrant 1 refers to business sectors where there is high economic integration and low 
political sovereignty. But not all aspects of “free trade” agreements are here. Quadrant 2 
refers to business sectors with low economic integration and low political sovereignty.

These are sectors that tend to be naturally local, such as labor. Quadrant 3 refers to busi-
ness sectors with combined high levels of economic integration and political sovereignty. 
While national treatment refers to the obligation of member states to treat all businesses 
from other member countries as if they were domestic businesses, this does not always 
apply; there are exempted sectors. Sectors in quadrant 3 are exempted from national 
treatment despite the efficiencies that would result from the application of national treat-
ment. The last matrix section, quadrant 4, refers to sectors that are typically local and are 
exempted from national treatment. 
 According to the NAFTA document, national treatment in quadrant 1 applies to sectors 
such as manufacturing and business service. In quadrant 2 are the temporary entry permits 
for business service professionals (such as consultants and engineers). Exempted sectors are 
in quadrants 3 and 4. Those with a high level of economic integration in quadrant 3 include 
transportation, financial services, energy, and agriculture. Those with low levels of economic 
integration in quadrant 4 are health care, education, social services, and cultural products. 
 This framework was also a model for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), 
agreed to at Quebec City in 2001. Unfortunately it was not implemented, due to oppo-
sition by Brazil. NAFTA was also the model for the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC), although this will not be fully effective until 2015 and 2020. 
  Figure   22.4    shows the more complex EU matrix. The two extra quadrants in the extreme 
left column capture the concept of an even lower level of political sovereignty, reciproc-
ity. The EU 1992 measures and subsequent “deepening” programs of political, social, and 
economic integration aim at quadrant A in everything but select sectors, such as culture. The 
manufacturing sector and business services are in quadrant A, which also includes banking 
and mutual funds, securities, insurance, transportation, broadcasting, tourism, and infor-
mation services. In addition, there are harmonization laws regulating company behavior, 
including mergers and acquisitions, trademarks and copyrights, cross-border mergers, and 
accounting operations across borders. Another important objective of harmonization is 
the opening of public procurement. It is clear that such harmonization efforts place almost 
all economic sectors in quadrant A of  Figure   22.4   . 31  In conclusion, in contrast to NAFTA, 
the EU has a much deeper degree of economic, political, and social integration and a con-
sequent loss of sovereignty for its member states. 
 Although both NAFTA and the EU can be analyzed in this way, many groups are 
opposed to such trade and investment liberalization. When they are opposed, they fre-
quently cloak themselves in the guise of ethics, as we will see in the case  International

 As MNEs operate across the world and NGOs operate globally, why are there 
no “global” or “international” environmental agreements to set rules for 
sustainable development? 
 The reason that there is no effective international environmental agreement is that there 
is no single international institution that can enforce one. The WTO deals with trade mat-
ters, not environmental issues. The United Nations deals with human rights in a political 
but not economic context. Further, the MNEs really do not operate globally, but are mainly 
“triad” based. And here, the US and EU triad blocs are often at odds on environmental, 
trade, and investment policies. Paradoxically, the NGOs are criticizing MNEs for some-
thing that they do not do: operate globally. The more responsible NGOs, which believe in 
sustainable development, should lobby the respective home-based triad authorities. This 
is where the power is—not with “global” governance. To ensure a safe environment, NGOs 
need to learn the realities of triad power.     
 The issue of globalization has opened up a gulf between representatives of   civil society such as 
NGOs on the one hand and international business such as MNEs on the other. Unfortunately 
these oppositions of opinion have become entrenched. In this section we will categorize per-
ceptions regarding the role of international institutions and future alternatives for trade lib-
eralization and indicate a range of more constructive responses for both MNEs and NGOs.  
 “Mobilizer” NGOs criticize the global trade and investment regime and believe that the 
major international institutions promoting free trade, such as the WTO, IMF, and World 
Bank, should be eliminated or fundamentally overhauled. “Technical” NGOs are relative 
insiders, willing to work with the mainstream international institutions in order to reduce 
perceived ineffectiveness or inequity in policy making. However, technical NGOs are now 
perceived by many national governments and business lobbies as having a common agenda 
with the mobilizers. This widespread perception has seriously affected the technical NGOs’ 
capacity to achieve important objectives on their usually benevolent agendas. 
 In addition it is difficult to see how the WTO can address the multitude of goals pre-
scribed by the anti-global mobilizers. The WTO is an understaffed bureaucracy with little 
political impact. The secretariat to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
has successfully acted on behalf of national governments to cut tariffs, mainly on manufac-
tured goods. Its value lies in the improved market access it opens to previously protected 
markets, thereby increasing overall economic efficiency; it functions by implementing 
rules of fairness agreed upon by sovereign states. 
 Unfortunately the WTO also embodies several asymmetric elements: on the one hand, 
it is consistently moving toward trade liberalization, but on the other, it is unable to elimi-
nate the protectionist policies in some sectors put in place by many of its members. 
 Furthermore, a major structural change at the new WTO, as compared to GATT, 
is the increased use of trade law and litigation for dispute settlement. As the stream of 
disputes swell the WTO is taking on a different shape. Instead of devoting most of its 
resources to promoting multinational trade liberalization and non-discrimination, the 
WTO is forced to focus much energy and expertise on resolving bilateral trade disputes.

 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ACTION 
 Is The Body Shop an ethical business? 
 When it comes to the ethical company, The Body Shop is 
hailed as the prototype of the responsible firm. The com-
pany’s website not only states the company’s values but 
urges visitors to become active in the fight to end animal 
cruelty, to protect human rights, and to implement fair 
trade practices. Its founder, Anita Roddick, started the 
company in 1976 by opening a small store in Brighton, 
England, to support her family. In 1978, the opening of a 
small store in Brussels became its first overseas expan-
sion. By the 1980s, the company was opening two stores 
per month. Today, The Body Shop has grown into an MNE 
with 1,900 stores in 50 countries around the world. 
 The company has a lengthy résumé of its social achieve-
ments. In the animal rights arena, The Body Shop joined 
the campaign for a ban on animal testing for cosmetic 
products. This was a major factor in the 1998 decision of 
the UK government to ban animal testing in the industry. 
On the environmental front, the company has publicly 
joined NGO causes. For example, in the 1980s, the com-
pany sponsored Greenpeace posters, joined the “Save 
the Whales Campaign,” and started a signature petition 
to ask the Brazilian government to halt the burning of 
the Amazon forest. The company also brought attention 
to Shell’s involvement in Nigeria. Shell’s operations were 
blamed for severe environmental deterioration, prosecu-
tion of protestors, and bribery of state officials. The Body 
Shop has converted many of its operations into Ecotricity, 
or energy from renewable resources, and helped create 
an academy of business with an ethical curriculum in the 
University of Bath. 
 The Body Shop’s image is tied to that of its founder. 
Anita Roddick was an active participant on environ-
mental rallies, fair trade missions, and in lobbying 
governments. She also defied the cosmetics industry’s 
portrayal of women and urged women to accept cellulite 
and wrinkles as a natural part of their bodies. She stated 
publicly that cosmetics claiming to solve these problems 
do not really work, an assertion that has created a back-
lash from competitors. Since the company went public in 
1985, she often found herself at odds with shareholders. 
In fact, in 1998 shareholders pressured her to step down 
from the CEO chair in favor of Patrick Gournay, who 
oversaw a major restructuring that saw 300 job cuts, 
the company’s withdrawal from manufacturing, and a 
management hiring spree to revitalize the company. In 
2000, Roddick announced that she would slowly retire 
from managing The Body Shop to concentrate on her 
activism. She died in 2009. The Body Shop became part 
of the French company L’Oreal Group in 2006, but is run 
independently and now has more than 2,100 stores in 
55 countries. 
 Another signature of The Body Shop is the “Trade 
not Aid” slogan. Under it, the company has sought to 
advance the plight of indigenous communities in Third 
World countries by promoting “Fair Trade.” The goal is 
to support marginalized sectors of society to develop a 
livelihood within the context of sustainable development. 
Today, the company sources cocoa butter, babassu oil, 
and massagers, among other ingredients and products, 
from Community Trade suppliers in 26 countries, includ-
ing India, Honduras, Nepal, and Mexico. In 2002–2003, the 
company purchased £5 million in natural products through 
its Community Trade program.  
 In the 1990s, the company suffered a severe blow to its 
reputation when  Business Ethics  published an article by Jon 
Entine claiming that the company was the opposite of what 
it represented itself to be. Entine accused the company 
of selling drugstore quality products at a large premium 
by marketing cosmetics with petrochemical ingredients 
as natural products. In addition, the author claimed the 
company misrepresented the amount of its donations to 
charity, did not adhere to its own principles of “Fair Trade,” 
and had itself committed unnecessary environmental dam-
age. For instance, Entine mentions an incident in which 
The Body Shop went back on a contract to purchase large 
amounts of shea butter from suppliers in Ghana. This left 
the suppliers with a lot of useless stock that they could 
not sell anywhere else. There are also alleged incidents

CHAPTER 22 CORPORATE ETHICS AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
While the WTO has been successful for 54 years in dealing with the technical tariff 
cuts, it is not very well equipped to deal with the new agenda of international trade 
and investment liberalization. Tariff cuts have allowed shallow integration across many 
manufacturing sectors. Today’s agenda, with major implications for MNEs engaged in 
FDI, is one of deep integration.  
 Figure  22.5 contrasts the various perceived roles and outcomes of the WTO. The insti-
tutional reality is largely that of quadrant 1, while the anti-global movement has been suc-
cessful in creating an image of the WTO as in quadrant 4.  
 The technical NGOs’ perspective is usually positioned in quadrant 2. Here, an assess-
ment of the efficiency outcomes of improved market access is often combined with a belief 
in the power of the WTO to actually dictate fundamental national policy choices that could 
favor the redistribution of wealth. The dominant picture suggested by the stakeholders 
of the company forcing low margins on suppliers in Third 
World countries. And, a franchisee in France claimed that 
The Body Shop dumped a load of plastic containers in a 
landfill site. 
 A number of consumer groups, NGOs, and Internet 
websites have all jumped on the wagon. The website 
mcspotlight.com claims that The Body Shop sells prod-
ucts with ingredients that have been tested on animals, 
as long as the testing was not done for cosmetics, and 
that some of its products contain gelatin, an animal 
product. The same website claims that, in industrialized 
countries, The Body Shop pays its employees near mini-
mum wages and is unwilling to recognize unions. The 
company is also accused of exaggerating the importance 
of its Community Trade program and of using the Kayapo 
Indians of Brazil for promotions without compensating 
them. 
 The Body Shop has denied most allegations and threat-
ened a number of news media with legal action but has 
only taken action against a few, including Channel 4 of 
England. For the company, which was built on the confi-
dence of the “conscious customer,” the consequences of 
this bad publicity could be devastating. Premium prices 
are, after all, what customers are willing to pay for that 
extra social responsibility. 
 Whether the allegations are true or not, The Body Shop 
can still claim to be a pioneer of corporate responsibility 
because it brought the issues to the table. Many companies 
have emulated its principles, including Boots of the UK, 
which has developed its own brand of environmentally-
friendly cosmetics to compete with The Body Shop.

hurt by free trade and investment is positioned in quadrant 3. These stakeholders typically 
include labor, management, and owners of non-competitive firms in import-competing 
sectors, which lack exports or outward FDI. Their view is that the WTO may indeed be an 
implementation mechanism of sovereign governments’ choices, but it results in increased 
inequality in the international distribution of economic power and wealth. 
 Two parameters critically determine the future options for further trade and investment 
liberalization: the choice between bilateral or regional and multilateral negotiations and 
between shallow or deeper integration. These choices are represented in  Figure   22.6   . 
 Quadrant 1 represents the old, highly successful GATT process of tariffs cuts and shallow 
integration. Quadrant 3 represents the new agenda of the WTO in terms of deep integration, 
including investment liberalization. Quadrant 2 represents the old regional trade agreements 
with tariff cuts (the Andean pact, the Caribbean initiative, ASEAN, etc.). Quadrant 4 rep-
resents the new type of regional trade agreements, such as NAFTA. These include national 
treatment for FDI and also enhanced market access for services and intellectual property. 
Quadrant 3, with deep multilateral integration, undoubtedly constitutes an optimal situ-
ation for all nations concerned in terms of long-term wealth creation, but is at present not 
feasible because of constraints such as the structure of the WTO and US policy preferences. 
Quadrant 2 represents the worst-case scenario of shallow, regional integration. 
 This analysis demonstrates the perverse effects that mobilizers can have on trade and 
investment liberalization. Poor countries and groups always benefit more from multi-
lateral than from regional agreements. They cannot be shut out from the former, and 
individual nations such as the United States always have less power in multilateral than 
in regional cases because of the number of countries involved. The strengthening, not 
the weakening, of mainstream global institutions such as the WTO—so despised by the 
mobilizers—may well represent the fastest route for poorer countries toward achieving 
fundamentally higher living standards for their population.   
  The pattern of MNE responses  
  Figure   22.7    categorizes MNE responses to civil society criticisms. The vertical axis distin-
guishes between a strategy that differentiates between stakeholders with whom a dialogue is 
possible and those with whom it is not, and, on the bottom, a strategy of uniform response. 
The horizontal axis makes a distinction between a broad stakeholder perspective on the

CHAPTER 22 CORPORATE ETHICS AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
right, whereby goals other than shareholder wealth maximization are considered relevant, 
and, on the left, a narrower shareholder, proﬁ t-maximizing perspective. 
 Quadrant 2 reflects the outdated perspective on MNEs, paradoxically adopted by most 
mobilizers. They view MNEs as profit maximizers, who will systematically refuse a con-
structive dialogue with any stakeholder representing civil society. Quadrant 1 represents 
an equally outdated response that is now being rejected by most large MNEs. Management 
has a shareholder perspective and its differential response is usually a PR exercise whereby 
an MNE provides lip service to the goals of friendly stakeholders but in fact is not serious 
about stakeholder management. 
 In fact, many MNEs are now positioned in quadrant 3. They pursue a stakeholder 
management model, perhaps driven by sustainable development environmental consid-
erations. Here MNEs try to identify those salient stakeholders that can contribute to a 
win–win situation for the firm and society at large. These firms face the challenge of dis-
tinguishing between destructive mobilizers and benevolent, technical NGOs. 
 The main danger is for MNEs to fall in the quadrant 4 trap, whereby their stakeholder 
management approach can be abused by mobilizers, because the firm has not set up proper 
screening mechanisms to establish which stakeholder demands are legitimate and which are 
not. This problem is faced by many companies operating in both developing and advanced 
countries that are unfairly accused of unethical behavior (for example, Shell in the disposal of 
a North Sea oil rig where Greenpeace misrepresented the position in order to win publicity). 
 A useful alliance could take place between MNEs with a quadrant 1 viewpoint in  Figure  22.7 
and the technical NGOs of quadrant 2. An example of this is the idea of sustainable develop-
ment, whereby MNEs are the actors making new and environmentally sensitive investments. 
In contrast, alliances between the protected and inefficient firms in quadrant 3 and mobilizer 
NGOs in quadrant 4 are not useful. Yet this was exactly the type of coalition put together 
in Seattle in 1999 to disrupt the WTO meetings. There, labor, mobilizer NGOs, and even 
 technical NGOs made common cause against business and governments. 
 Three suggestions are offered as to how MNEs should proceed: 
 1  The activities of external stakeholders should be discussed at the board and top man-
agement level, and an overall strategy should be developed to deal with them. It is 
important to make a distinction between technical NGOs and anti-global mobilizers. 
Initiatives should be developed to work with the former. Clear arguments should be

PART FIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES
developed to appropriately counter the discourse of the mobilizers, and this should be 
combined with an effective communication strategy to reach relevant audiences.  
 2   Sustainable development and ethical stakeholder perspectives should be embedded 
within the organization and its culture.  
 3   The firm should not engage in a debate with mobilizers (or even technical NGOs) 
through a small set of PR people; instead all senior managers should be trained to 
articulate the concept of stakeholder capitalism, rather than shareholder capitalism, and 
the contribution of the organization to the resulting wealth creation. In other words, all 
senior managers in the firm should engage with NGOs.   
 As a result of the above initiatives firms should experience a dramatic improvement 
in both profile and performance. The firms that will do best in future will be those that 
take leadership positions with respect to stakeholder management, capture the concept 
of values-driven rather than profit-driven capitalism, and respect their most important 
resource—namely, their employees. These policies will be the most effective tools at the 
microeconomic level against ideology-driven mobilizers. 
 For their part, NGOs, especially the technical ones, need to understand that anti-global 
rhetoric is leading to regional integration and bilateral agreements, as a politically more 
feasible—but ultimately less efficient—alternative to global integration. This does not 
benefit the objectives of civil society. Free trade and investment liberalization have not yet 
been achieved due to the vested interests and misperceptions of some components of civil 
society and affected stakeholders. We now need to recognize and correct these mispercep-
tions as a precondition to achieving an overarching increase in world welfare and incomes.

 Where would a company like Coca-Cola, or others in the table above, be 
positioned in  Figure  22.7 ? Why? 
 Coca Cola is probably positioned in quadrant 3 of  Figure   22.7   . In order to protect its world-
wide brand, which has to be delivered locally through host country partners and bottling 
subsidiaries, it is highly responsive to different stakeholder groups with whom it engages 
in a dialogue to pursue a differential response. Such local responsiveness is particularly 
important to an MNE dealing with local host government regulations and NGOs. As a 
result, Coca-Cola is highly ranked as one of the more environmentally responsive and 
socially aware companies. 
 1  There will be an increase in the amount of international business research that is being 
conducted. This will come in the form of both theory testing and the practical application 
of information. Both academicians and practitioners will find this development helpful.  
 2   Multinationals, as flagship firms, are beginning to develop new business network re-
lationships with suppliers, competitors, governments, unions, universities, and a host 
of other external groups. This networking relationship is proving particularly helpful in 
increasing productivity, profitability, and overall competitiveness.

 Dell: B2C 
 Dell is a leader in personal computers. It competes with 
Toshiba, HP, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo, Asustek, etc. 
Dell is based in Austin, Texas, and has production fac-
tories in Tennessee. It also produces in Ireland, Malaysia, 
Brazil, and China. Dell operates in four business segments: 
large enterprise, public, small and medium business, and 
consumer. It designs, develops, manufactures, markets, 
sells, and supports a range of products and services that 
can be customized to individual customer requirements. 
In February 2011, it acquired Compellent Technologies, 
Inc. During the fiscal year ended January 28, 2011, it 
completed five acquisitions Kace Networks, Inc., Ocarina 
Networks Inc., Scalent Systems Inc., Boomi, Inc., and InSite 
One, Inc. For the fiscal year ended 28 January 2011, Dell’s 
revenues increased 16 percent to $61.49 billion compared 
to the previous year. Net income increased 84 percent to 
 REAL CASE 
 3  The two environments that will present the greatest challenges for MNEs in the future 
are the political and the economic. The rising tide of protectionism will require that 
multinationals deal astutely with foreign governments. They will also have to weigh 
carefully the political risk associated with investing in countries that are now beginning 
to shed their central planning systems and to move toward free enterprise economies.  
 4   The principle of national treatment reduces political sovereignty, although some sectors 
are exempted in NAFTA, the FTAA, and APEC. In contrast, the EU has deep integration 
across political and social areas, as well as economic.  
 5   The interaction between MNEs and NGOs is complex but can be better understood by 
constructing an analytical framework.

$2.64 billion. Revenues reflect an increase in income from 
large enterprise segment, higher income from public seg-
ment, an increase in income from small and medium busi-
ness segment and higher income from consumer segment. 
Dell generated 52 percent of its sales in the United States 
and 48 percent from foreign sales. 
 But its success lies in marketing directly to consumers 
rather than in any technological or cost advantages associ-
ated with production. Dell introduced the Dell Direct model, 
a business-to-consumer (B2C) concept, which has now been 
copied by major competitors. By eliminating retailers, Dell 
can deal directly with individual customers, offering detailed 
and richly configured systems. There is consumer customiz-
ation, plus services and support. This method saves on inven-
tory and introduces new technology quickly. Dell became a 
market leader with the first B2C direct business model. 
 The computer industry is at a mature stage of manu-
facturing. This means that there is pressure either to be 
extremely cost competitive or to develop value-added ser-
vices that build on the computer itself. The five major 
computer manufacturers have responded to these market 
changes in different ways. IBM invented the personal com-
puter and was perhaps the first to move strongly toward 
customer service. But eventually in 2004 it got out of per-
sonal computers altogether, selling the business to China’s 
Lenovo as PC become commoditized. In late 2002, Hewlett-
Packard and Compaq merged to try to consolidate production 
but also to develop the service end. This left Apple and Dell 
as the firms driven by low cost and technology. 
 In China, Dell has developed an innovative B2C concept 
that is allowing it to quickly increase its market share. 
PC manufacturers have been flocking to China because 
of high expected growth. Dell entered the Chinese market 
in the 1990s, trailing behind IBM and Compaq. Soon Dell 
became the second largest foreign PC market player, after 
three local Chinese manufacturers. One way in which Dell 
was able to achieve this was by introducing the affordable 
Smart PC. Another has been to offer tailor-made PCs over 
the Internet. A Chinese customer virtually builds his or her 
desired computer and then Dell assembles and delivers 
it. Implementing B2C retailing has not been easy because 
Chinese people are not used to credit cards. To overcome 
this obstacle, the company has made deals with major 
banks to allow customers to go to a branch and make a pay-
ment that is then reported to Dell. More recently, the larg-
est Chinese computer manufacturers started to compete 
aggressively in the lower end of the market, forcing Dell to 
move upmarket where it expects to reap the benefits of a 
growing number of luxury-minded individuals. As of 2009, 
China’s laptop PC market share by volume and value of the 
top five market leaders are as follows: Lenovo China Co., 
Ltd. 29.5 percent, HP Development Company 16.2 percent, 
Asustek Computer Corporation 10.2 percent, Dell Group 
9.2 percent, Hasee Computer Co., Ltd. 6.5 percent. 
 Throughout the world, Dell has tried to add service value 
in its B2C process. It has 80 Internet sites on which more 
than 65,000 institutional customers do business with Dell. 
Through  www.dell.com  customers can order, price, and 
configure products. Dell maintains after-sales service with 
customers. It also brings new technology quickly to the 
customer. In short, Dell’s B2C system allows the MNE to 
engage in mass customization.

 Maersk Group 
 An example of the business-to-business (B2B) relational 
contracts found in the flagship model can be found in some 
of the operations of Maersk. This is the world’s largest 
container-based shipping group. It has B2B relationships 
with companies that use its containers, with port auth-
orities, and with supplies of its energy resources. 
 A.P. Moller-Maersk (APM) is a Denmark-based shipping 
group with sales of $56.1 billion and assets of $66.76 billion 
in 2010. The group owns and operates container carriers, bulk 
carriers, supply and specialty ships, and tankers. The group 
also provides various services in the areas of energy, shipping 
and offshore, and retail. The A.P. Moller-Maersk Group com-
prises approximately 1,100 companies. The group owns and 
operates more than 500 container vessels with a total cap-
acity of around 3 million TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units). 
 The main competitors to Maersk are shown in  Table   1   .  
 The Maersk Group divides its business into six seg-
ments: container shipping and related, tankers, offshore 
and related, terminals, oil and gas, retail and other, and 
technology. These are shown in  Figure  22.8 .

 Maersk Line  is one of the leading liner shipping com-
panies in the world, serving customers all over the globe. 
The company also has nearly 3,000,000 containers and 
operates across 130 countries. The Maersk Group provides 
similar container services across north/south trade lanes 
under the Safmarine name. 
 Maersk Logistics  was combined with Damco in 2007 and 
no longer exists.  
 Damco  offers services such as inland haulage, customs 
house brokerage, and refrigerated services. The company

also offers customized and integrated solutions for opera-
tions such as supply-chain management; warehousing 
and distribution; and ocean freight. The company primarily 
provides its services to the retail, electronics, fast-moving 
consumer goods, and chemical industries. 
 APM Terminals  is one of the world’s largest operators of 
container terminals with over 50 container terminals span-
ning 34 countries and five continents. The company primarily 
engages in the development of port infrastructure necessary 
to meet the future demands of the global container trade. APM 
Terminals works closely with governments, country leaders, 
customers, truckers, and the entire shipping community to 
ensure supply-chain efficiency and world-class service. 
 Maersk Container Industry  produces various types of 
reefer containers for the transportation of goods through 
ship, rail, or truck. 
 Maersk Oil  operates the oil production of more than 
700,000 barrels per day and more than 1,000 million cubic 
feet (28 million m 3 ) of gas production per day in the Danish 
and British parts of the North Sea, offshore Qatar, in 
Algeria, and in Kazakhstan. It conducts exploration activi-
ties in those areas as well as offshore Norway, the US Gulf 
of Mexico, Brazil, Angola and Oman. 
 Through  Maersk Tankers, Maersk Contractors, and 
Maersk Supply Services  the company offers solutions 
for the transport of crude oil, refined products, and gas; 
various supply vessel activities (including anchor handling, 
platform supply, and cable laying); drilling activities with 
mobile production units, and drilling rigs and ships, includ-
ing advanced jack-up rigs, salvage and towage activities, as 
well as door-to-door transport and inter-European freight 
and passenger transport. 
 Maersk Tankers  owns and operates one of the world’s 
largest and most modern fleets of crude, product and gas 
tankers. The fleet consists of more than 230 vessels. 
 Maersk Drilling  (formerly known as Maersk Contractors) 
provides drilling and production services to oil companies. 
The company commands an extensive and technologi-
cally advanced fleet of some of the world’s most advanced 
harsh environment jack-up rigs, 375 ft and 350 ft jack-up 
rigs, deepwater semi-submersibles, drilling barges and 
workover barges. 
 Maersk Supply Services  is primarily engaged in the field 
of tow-out and installation of large offshore installations, 
and other chartering services. The company maintains 
more than 50 offshore support vessels. 
 Examples of flagship partnerships 
 Maersk Line has flagship relationships. As explained above, 
it is one of the leading liner shipping companies. It oper-
ates over 580 container vessels and more than 3,000,000 
containers. This amounts to 11,363.63 miles (18,288 km) 
of containers. Although the Maersk organization is exten-
sively vertically integrated and produces vessels, contain-
ers, and oil through subsidiaries, Maersk Line is highly 
dependent on their business networks. Mr. Søren Skou, the 
Partner Chief Executive Officer of Maersk Liner Business, 
recognizes the importance of partnerships, stating that 
 “communication  and  partnerships are as important as the 
physical movement of goods.” 
 Maersk Line maintains a strategically critical rela-
tionship with its competitors. In the midst of flattening 
sales, the beginning of 2008 saw agreements between 
the top three largest container ship lines of Maersk Line, 
Mediterranean Shipping Co., and CMA CGM sharing ves-
sel space on the trans-Pacific trade. Government rela-
tions are also of high importance. In 2007, the Maersk 
Group spent $950,000 lobbying the federal government 
on issues such as port safety, railroad regulations, and 
ballast water legislation. The group is also a member of

C–TPAT (Customs–Trade Partnership Against Terrorism), 
headed by the Department of Homeland Security. Maersk 
Line Limited, another Maersk Group subsidiary, trans-
ports more US government cargo related to military 
and humanitarian missions than any other company. In 
2007, this amounted to 140,000 TEU of US military cargo 
alone. The Maersk organization also maintains ties with 
research and educational institutions. In Denmark, Maersk 
is engaged in a corporate partnership with the Copenhagen 
Business School designed to provide real-world business 
applications and attract talent. Additionally, Maersk Line 
is also engaged in development projects such as that of 
an energy-saving cooling system involving Wageningen 
University, sponsored by the Dutch government. Other 
flagship relationships include: 
 IBM:  In 2005, IBM and Maersk Logistics joined forces to 
bring real-time, enhanced visibility to global supply-chain 
operations by improving the quality of container tracking 
and enabling increased security of transported goods. 
The solution includes highly intelligent wireless tracking 
devices and an advanced technology network for use by 
manufacturers, retailers, logistics providers, carriers, and 
governments to share real-time cargo information. 
 NVOCCs:  As Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers, 
larger freight forwarders compete directly with Maersk 
Logistics but also have attractive contracts with Maersk Line 
and Safmarine. In fact, it is possible that leading forwarders
such as Kuehne & Nagel and ABX logistics have more 
attractive contracts than Maersk Logistics.
